(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a half-year profit rise and outlined ordinary dividend 
policy plans, which will kick off with a maiden EUR400 million payout. 
The dividend outlook came in its first-half results, which showed revenue jumped 30% on-year in the six months to 
September 30 to EUR8.58 billion from EUR6.62 billion. Profit after tax, before one-offs, surged 59% to EUR2.18 
billion from EUR1.37 billion. Pretax profit rose at the same pace to EUR2.46 billion from EUR1.42 billion.
"Ryanair Holdings reported a strong half-year profit... thanks to a strong Easter in the first quarter, record summer 
traffic and higher fares which offset significantly higher fuel costs," the company statement said Monday.
Traffic grew 11% to 105 million passengers, while average fares jumped by almost one quarter.
Ryanair still targets full-year traffic of 183.5 million passengers. It expects profit after tax of EUR1.85 billion to 
EUR2.05 billion. 
Ryanair declared a maiden ordinary dividend of EUR400 million, some EUR0.35 per share, though an interim and 
final dividend of EUR200 million each. These will payable in February and September of next year.
"Ryanair's shareholders invested EUR400 million in a share placing during the peak of the Covid crisis in 
September 2020, which was key to Ryanair subsequently issuing a timely, low cost, EUR850 million bond, which 
helped the group emerge from the Covid pandemic in a position of unrivalled strategic and financial strength," the 
firm said.
For subsequent financial years, Ryanair will return about 25% of profit after tax, adjusted for non-recurring gains or 
losses, through ordinary dividends. 
UPDATE: Ryanair sets out dividend plans as half-year profit jumps
In addition, Ryanair said it will "will retain the flexibility to consider, when or if appropriate, the return of surplus cash 
to shareholders through special dividends and/or share buybacks".

(Alliance News) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday announced that net profit surged 72% in its first 
half, thanks to higher fares and record traffic during the peak summer season.
Profit after tax came in at EUR2.2 billion in the six months to the end of September compared with EUR1.3 billion in 
the equivalent period one year earlier, Ryanair said in a statement.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the carrier's full-year outlook "remains highly dependent on the absence of 
any unforeseen adverse events – for example such as Ukraine or Gaza – between now and the end of March".
The aviation sector is enjoying a strong recovery after suffering heavy losses at the start of the decade when the 
Covid pandemic grounded flights worldwide.
"Ryanair Holdings reported a strong half-year profit... thanks to a strong Easter in the first quarter, record summer 
traffic and higher fares which offset significantly higher fuel costs," the company statement said Monday.
Traffic grew 11% to 105 million passengers, while average fares jumped by almost one quarter.
O'Leary said the company expects full-year net profit of between EUR1.85 billion and EUR2.05 billion – a forecast 
that assumes "modest losses" over the winter.
He added that the outlook was clouded by uncertainty over the delivery of new Boeing Co planes, "a significantly 
higher full-year fuel bill, very limited fourth-quarter visibility and the risk of weaker consumer spending over coming 
months". 
Boeing last month reported another hefty loss as it trimmed its full-year forecast for deliveries of the 737 to address 
a manufacturing problem on the aircraft.

(Alliance News) - Online travel agents have won a High Court fight with Ryanair Holdings PLC after suing over 
refunds paid after flights were cancelled or changed.
A judge has awarded three companies within On the Beach Group PLC GBP2 million damages after considering 
evidence at a High Court hearing in London.
Judge Nigel Cooper outlined his conclusions in a ruling published on Tuesday.
The judge said On the Beach, Sunshine.co.uk and Classic Package Holidays had claimed GBP2 million in total.
He said that figure represented the cost of flights refunded to travellers for package holidays in "circumstances 
where Ryanair have cancelled or made what are described as major changes to flights which were part of the 
packages".
Lawyers representing the airline disputed that the On the Beach group had "any good cause of action" against 
Ryanair.
The judge made findings in favour of the On the Beach group and said its claim succeeded "in the amount" of 
GBP2,056,745.
"On the Beach group's claim in this action is for a sum of some GBP2 million which they say represents the cost of 
flights which they have refunded to travellers for package holidays in circumstances where Ryanair have cancelled 
or made what are described as major changes to flights which were part of the packages," said the judge in his 
ruling.
"Although Ryanair dispute that On the Beach group have any legal entitlement to the refunds claimed, Ryanair have 
acknowledged …that for commercial and political reasons Ryanair are willing to refund the cost of flights which 
On The Beach companies win GBP2m High Court damages fight with Ryanair
have been cancelled provided that appropriate arrangements are put in place so that they are not at risk of being 
required to refund travellers twice for the same flight."
The judge indicated that the litigation was "part of a much wider" dispute "as to the extent to which online travel 
agents may book flights operated by Ryanair".
Shaun Morton, chief executive of On the Beach, said: "We welcome the High Court's decision to uphold our 
application for Ryanair to pay back what was owed.
"Today's outcome sends an important message on how refunds should be handled and emphasises the industry's 
responsibility to holidaymakers.
"On the Beach is committed to doing the right thing for its customers."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday hailed record advance bookings on 17 new routes to and 
from Tirana, Albania, starting from Tuesday next week.
The Dublin-based budget airline said the 17 new routes will connect Albania to major inbound visitor markets, such 
as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden and the UK. 
Ryanair said it believes "substantial" traffic and tourism growth will be stimulated by its "unbeatable low air fares, 
which finally offer low fare competition and choice to the high fare airlines, who presently dominate in Albania".
Fares start from EUR15 one way, Ryanair said, forecasting 1.6 million annual passengers in the first year of the 
new flights.
"The scale of Ryanair's winter operation in Tirana with 17 routes, and over 200 weekly frequencies show the 
extraordinary demand there is for really low fare inbound travel to Albania and among Albanian citizens too," said 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary. 
He added: "Ryanair is the only major airline in Europe that has recovered to 130% of its pre-Covid traffic. This 
winter we hope to receive 57 new aircraft from Boeing [Co] as part of our post-Covid growth and recovery 
plan...Ryanair plans to grow its fleet to 800 aircraft, and its traffic to 300m passengers [per annum] over the next 
decade, and we believe that Albania will be a key growth market for Ryanair's low fares."
Shares in Ryanair were down 2.1% to EUR14.06 each in Dublin midday Thursday.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC announced it has cut its winter flight schedule due to delays in the delivery 
of new Boeing Co 737 planes.
It will reduce the number of aircraft it planned to base at several airports across Europe, including East Midlands 
Airport and Dublin Airport.
The airline said it was due to receive 27 new Boeing aircraft between September and December, but expects the 
figure to be just 14.
This has been attributed to production delays at the Spirit fuselage factory in Wichita, Kansas, combined with 
Boeing hold-ups in repairs and deliveries in Seattle, Washington.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "We are working closely with Boeing and their supplier, Spirit, to 
minimise these delivery delays.
"It is deeply regrettable that production problems in Wichita and in Seattle have yet again delayed Boeing's 
contracted deliveries to Ryanair this winter.
"We are in regular dialogue with Boeing, and our primary objective is to ensure we get delivery of all 57 contracted 
B737 aircraft before the end of May 2024, so that Ryanair's fleet can grow to over 600 aircraft for what will be our 
largest ever summer flight programme.
"These flight cancellations will take effect from the end of October, and will be communicated to all affected 
passengers by email over the coming days.
"Passengers will be offered re-accommodation on alternative flights or full refunds as they so wish.
"We apologise sincerely to passengers for any inconvenience caused by these delivery delays this winter.
Ryanair cuts flights due to delivery delays of Boeing 737 planes
"At this early date, we do not expect these delivery delays will materially affect our full-year traffic target of 183.5 
million, but if the delays worsen or extend further into the January to March 2024 period, we may have to revisit this 
figure and possibly adjust it slightly downward."
Ryanair shares traded 1.1% higher at EUR15.72 each on Thursday morning in Frankfurt.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is considering a move to a listing in Brussels from Dublin currently, the 
Sunday Times reported. 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said there is "no reason" why the company should be listed in Dublin over 
Brussels, according to the Sunday Times. 
The newspaper said that while Ryanair's Dublin listing is not under immediate threat, the firm is frustrated by its 
listing rules. O'Leary believes the listing rules are too closely aligned with the London Stock Exchange's, instead of 
other Euronext NV arenas. The Dublin stock exchange forms part of the Euronext group.

Ryanair had completed its delisting from the LSE in December 2021, blaming shrivelling post-Brexit trading 
volumes in London for the move. It has a primary listing in Dublin. 
A departure for Ryanair would be a blow to the Dublin market. Building materials firm CRH PLC's delisting from 
Dublin comes into effect on Monday. It will continue to trade in London, though its primary listing will be in New 
York. It will depart the blue-chip FTSE 100 index as a result, being replaced by kitchen supplier Howden Joinery 
Group PLC.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is being probed in Italy over alleged market abuse which risks leaving 
travel agents out of pocket, the nation's competition watchdog said Wednesday. 
The Italian Competition Authority said it has kicked off its probe after receiving a number of reports since last May. 
The watchdog's preliminary view is that the Dublin-based carrier is "leveraging on its dominant position" in the travel 
sector to provide other tourist services, such as hotel and car rental bookings. This is harming travel agencies, the 
regulator said. 
"In particular, on one side Ryanair appears to impede travel agencies from directly acquiring airline tickets through 
their own websites; on the other side, Ryanair permits the purchase of airline tickets exclusively for traditional travel 
agencies via the [global distribution system] platform, subjecting them to considerably less favourable conditions in 
terms of pricing, range of available services, and post-sale management of airline tickets," the competition regulator 
explained. 
"Ryanair's conduct seeks to restrict travel agencies from selling airline tickets, which is typically the initial step in 
planning a holiday and a crucial entry point for selling additional services. As such, it could have adverse 
consequences on both travel agencies and end-consumers, leading to a deterioration of conditions, both in terms of 
quantity and quality, and unjustified difficulties in managing reservations."
Ryanair shares were 0.1% higher at EUR16.47 each in Dublin on Wednesday morning.

passenger traffic increased in August compared to a year before, with Wizz Air also seeing improved aircraft usage. 
Dublin-based Ryanair said that it carried 19 million passengers in August, up 11% from 17 million a year prior. The 
load factor was unchanged at 96%.

million passengers in August 2022, at a load factor of 94%, up from 91% a year ago.

UK government orders review into air traffic control chaos

(Alliance News) - The UK government on Tuesday ordered a review after the country's air traffic control system 
suffered its worst disruption in almost ten years, stranding thousands of passengers.  
Flights departing and arriving in the UK continued to be cancelled one day after air traffic control systems were 
temporarily hit by a technical fault.
Transport Secretary Mark Harper said there would be an independent review into the worst incident of its kind for 
"nearly a decade" and that is expected to last well into the week.
"This was a technical fault. We do not think this was a cybersecurity incident," he told GB News.
The last Monday of August, a public holiday in Britain, traditionally sees large numbers of passengers returning 
from summer vacations.
"I know people will be enormously frustrated by the disruption that's impacting them," Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 
said in a broadcast statement.
"Thankfully things like this are rare and the issue itself was fixed in a matter of hours, but the disruption obviously is 
continuing and will last for a little while longer."
The National Air Traffic Services said it "identified and remedied" a technical issue which forced it to impose traffic 
flow restrictions.
NATS said the issue meant flight plans had to be processed manually, while it indicated to AFP that hundreds of 
flights had been affected and that it would take "several days" for the situation to return to normal.
London's main airports continued to be affected with Heathrow and Gatwick cancelling dozens of flights Tuesday.
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA's British Airways was the worst affected airline.
UK government orders review into air traffic control chaos
Aviation analytics company Cirium said 790 departures and 785 arrivals were cancelled across all UK airports on 
Monday.
That was equivalent to just over one quarter of planned flights, dealing a blow to the sector following its recent 
strong recovery from the Covid shutdown. 
"We expect some flight cancellations and considerable flight delays today caused by this latest, still unexplained, 
NATS failure," no-frills carrier Ryanair said in a statement Tuesday.
Angry passengers took to social media, demanding a far better response from airlines. 
"Already we're seeing worrying reports of passengers being left stranded without support, and airlines failing to 
properly communicate with their passengers or fulfil their legal obligations," said Rory Boland, travel editor at 
consumer-advice publication Which?
He noted that carriers were obliged to offer "timely rerouting" or provide overnight accommodation.

During the period, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi also launched its latest route to Erbil, the capital city of the Kurdistan region 
of Iraq, in a move to unlock travel opportunities for both residents and travellers in the United Arab Emirates. 
Additionally, the Hungarian airline said carbon dioxide emissions in the month of July were up 25% to 523,996 
tonnes from 418,290t during the same period a year ago.

Ryanair accused of 'invasive' facial recognition use in Spain

(Alliance News) - A prominent digital privacy campaign group on Thursday filed a complaint against Ryanair 
Holdings PLC in Spain, alleging the popular budget carrier was pushing customers to undergo an "invasive facial 
recognition process". 
Austria's noyb (None Of Your Business) said the Irish airline – Europe's largest by passenger numbers – required 
some customers to go though "a mandatory 'verification process' involving invasive facial recognition". 
This applied to bookings through an online travel agent rather than directly on the company's website or app. 
"There is no reasonable justification for Ryanair to implement this system. Instead, it seems like the airline is 
willingly violating their customer's right to data protection in order to obtain an unfair competitive advantage over 
alternative booking channels," the group said in a statement.
Ryanair said in a statement emailed to AFP that it was seeking "to protect customers". 
"Online travel agents scrape Ryanair's inventory and in many cases miss-sell our flights and ancillary services with 
hidden mark-ups and provide incorrect customer contact information/ payment details," the airline said.
The verification process is "to ensure that they (as the passenger) make the necessary security declarations and 
are informed directly of all safety and regulatory protocols required when travelling". 
Noyb said the complaint came from a customer from Spain who booked a Ryanair flight through the Barcelona-
based online travel agency eDreams and then received an email from Ryanair requesting her to complete a 
"verification process".
The case was filed with the Spanish Data Protection Agency.
Ryanair accused of 'invasive' facial recognition use in Spain
Noyb said Ryanair "didn't provide comprehensible information about the purpose of this intrusive process" which 
requires the client's consent under the EU's data protection regulation.
Ryanair said its processes were "fully compliant with all GDPR regulations".
On its website, Ryanair says customers' identity may need to be verified when a booking is made "by a third-party 
travel agent that has no commercial agreement with Ryanair to sell our flights".
It details two ways of doing the verification process online – the "express" version uses facial recognition technology 
by Ryanair partner GetID and costs 0.59 euro cents.
A third option is going directly to an airport check-in desk before the flight, where Ryanair's check-in fee applies.
Vienna-based noyb is handling hundreds of complaints in various jurisdictions on behalf of internet users over data 
protection and rights concerns.
It has won several cases against some of the world's largest multinationals.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.2% at EUR15.73 each in Dublin on Thursday around midday.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said that quarterly revenue and profit soared, thanks to a 
strong Easter, as well as an extra bank holiday weekend.
The Dublin-based budget airline reported that revenue increased by 40% to EUR3.65 billion in the quarter ended 
June 30, from EUR2.60 billion.
Pretax profit in the company's first quarter of its financial year surged to EUR740.7 million from EUR203.0 million.
Ryanair explained that the improved results were thanks to a strong Easter, the extra UK Coronation public holiday 
and May and weak prior year comparisons due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which damaged 
last year's traffic and fares.
The number of customers increased annually by 11% to 50.4 million from 45.5 million. Load factor improved to 95% 
from 92%. 
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it expects financial 2024 traffic to be up 9% annually to 183.5 million, which is lowed 
that the 185 million originally anticipated. It explained that this is due to Boeing delivery delays in spring and in 
autumn.
It noted that whilst bookings in the second quarter have been "strong", the fare increase will be much lower than in 
the first quarter due to much stronger pricing last year when summer travel "snapped back" following the Ukraine 
invasion. 
It currently expects second quarter fares will be higher year-on-year but by a low double-digit percentage.

(Alliance News) - Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC plans to invest over USD3 billion to rebuild 
Ukraine's aviation industry once the war ends and the EU Aviation Safety Agency declares flying into and out of 
Ukraine is safe again.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary also promised a swift restart of flights in Ukraine after the end of the war, following a 
trip to Kiev on Thursday.
Ryanair will resume flights eight weeks after airspace reopens, the company said after meeting Ukrainian 
government representatives.
Up to 30 aircraft will be stationed at Kiev, Lviv and Odessa airports and 600 flights a week will be offered to 20 EU 
capitals, O'Leary said during the visit.
Within five years, the offer is to be doubled from initially five to 10 million seats per year.
Ryanair said it was the second-largest airline in Ukraine before the invasion.
The airports in Kharkiv and Kherson are also to be returned to as soon as the infrastructure has been restored, 
O'Leary said in a statement.
Ryanair managers met Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration of Ukraine and Infrastructure Minister 
Oleksandr Kubrakov, a company statement said.
They also discussed Ukraine's main airports, Kiev, Lviv and Odessa in Boryspil International Airport, invited by 
Oleksiy Dubrevskyy, who heads Boryspil International Airport.
The Ryanair senior management examined the condition of airport terminals, baggage claim and passenger check-
in and boarding gate areas, control points, and aprons during the visit.
Ryanair to invest USD3 billion, restart flights to Ukraine after war
Ryanair also plans to open daily domestic flights between Kiev, Lviv, and Odessa, as soon as the airports are 
operational.
Ryanair will base up to 30 new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft worth over USD3 billion at the three main Ukrainian 
airports, "giving Ukrainian citizens and visitors access to Europe's lowest air fares, as Ukraine rebuilds its economy 
in a post invasion environment," the statement said.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly 17 months ago. "Ryanair was Ukraine's second largest 
airline before the unlawful Russian invasion in February 2022," O'Leary said.
"Once the skies over Ukraine have reopened for commercial aviation, Ryanair will charge back into Ukraine linking 
the main Ukraine airports with over 20 EU capitals, and we are working closely with the Ukrainian government to 
rebuild Ukraine's aviation, industry and its economy."
"The fastest way to rebuild and restore the Ukrainian economy will be with low fare air travel," he said.

(Alliance News) - Pilots of budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC are on strike in Belgium this weekend over pay cuts, 
leading to the cancellation of 120 flights to and from Charleroi airport, news agency Belga reported.
The pilots are demanding that their salaries be restored to levels before the Covid-19 pandemic.
Pilots had at the time accepted a temporary pay cut to help the firm ride out the financial impact of the travel 
restrictions imposed during the pandemic.
Pilots also reported issues with their rest periods, according to Belgian media.
Several meetings held between pilots' representatives and Ryanair failed to resolve the dispute, meaning 80% of 
Ryanair pilots based at Charleroi airport went on strike.
In total 120 flights from and to Charleroi airport have been cancelled, of which 62 were scheduled for Saturday and 
58 for Sunday.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has resigned from the UK Aviation Council and branded it as 
a "talking shop" which does not deliver benefits or reform for the sector or passengers.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary accused the organisation, led by Baroness Vere, of being "useless and 
ineffective" on a range of issues in recent months.
The council was set up to bring industry and Government together to help the UK retain its spot as one of the 
world's strongest aviation sectors.
The council held its first meeting in February 2023, its second in April was postponed and the third took place on 
Tuesday, Ryanair said.
O'Leary, who said the resignation is with immediate effect, said: "If Baroness Vere wants to deliver change or 
improve UK aviation, then she should disband this useless council and work instead with the UK's major airlines to 
deliver real and effective change, which will enable us to improve capacity and lower air fares for UK citizens and 
visitors.
"Instead, Baroness Vere prefers to waste her time, and ours, holding a quarterly talking shop, at which she 
promises action, but delivers none."
O'Leary said the Dublin-based carrier expects to grow its traffic in the UK in 2023 by 13% to 56 million passengers, 
and all of this is happening "without any support or initiative from the UK Government or its useless Aviation 
Council".
He stated: "We joined the UK Aviation Council in February when Transport Minister Mark Harper assured us it 
would be used as a 'delivery body' to improve the resilience of UK aviation. Sadly, this has proved to be an empty 
promise.
Ryanair resigns from UK Aviation Council branding it a "talking shop"
"There has been no action, no delivery, and no improvement in UK aviation, and the council has become a talking 
shop for Baroness Vere, government bureaucrats and the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) to waffle on about reform 
while delivering none."
Improvements to National Air Traffic Services staffing to reduce delays, the push for effective air space reform in 
Europe, better Border Control staffing and processing times and a cut to the UK visa costs are among the issues 
the budget airline has raised.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Thursday that the US class action lawsuit launched in November 
2018 by the City of Birmingham pension fund in Alabama has been settled. 
The Dublin-based budget airline has reached a USD5.0 million settlement of a lawsuit that accused them of 
defrauding shareholders by downplaying its willingness to recognise labour unions. 
The case was launched by the City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System: an 
Alabama pension fund. 
Shareholders accused Ryanair and Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary of inflating the company's stock price 
by attempting to mislead them into believing they would not welcome unions. 
The lawsuit cited CEO O'Leary's claim that hell would "freeze over" before Ryan accepted unions.
Shareholders also mentioned the company's claim that it had enough pilots when it actually had a pilot shortage. 
The company offered to recognise pilot unions to avert a strike in December 2017. 
After recent mediation between the parties, the lawsuit was settled.
This settlement followed the US District Court dismissal of several claims made by the plaintiff in 2020. This 
dismissal narrowed grounds for action.
Ryanair says that the finalised settlement agreement is subject to approval by the court. 
The company states that there was no lawful basis for this claim, but that the settlement is in the interest of all 
shareholders due to the modest settlement amount. 
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were up 1.0% at EUR16.92 in Dublin on Thursday.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it returned to profit in its recently concluded financial year 
and is "cautiously optimistic" of further growth in the new year, amid robust demand. 
The  Dublin-based budget airline said total revenue more than doubled to EUR10.78 billion in the financial year to 
March 31 from EUR4.80 billion a year before. 
Ryanair swung to a pretax profit of EUR1.44 billion from a loss of EUR429.8 million. 
From the previous year, load factor improved to 93% from 82%, as customer numbers rose by 74% to 168.6 million 
- which was also 13% ahead of financial 2020's levels, before the Covid-19 pandemic, Ryanair noted.  
Total operating costs rose 75% to EUR9.20 billion, mostly due to higher fuel costs, which more than doubled to 
EUR3.90 billion. 
The airline hailed its commitment to maintaining jobs throughout the pandemic, when its competitors had cut 
thousands of jobs. Ryanair said the strategy meant it was fully staffed to operate its summer schedule in 2022, 
whereas its competitors cancelled capacity, often at short notice, due to staff shortages. 
"As Ryanair grows traffic to [225 million per annum] by [financial 2026 and [300 million by financial 2034], our group 
will create over 10,000 new jobs for highly paid pilots, cabin crew, and engineers," it said. 
With short-haul capacity below pre-Covid levels, demand is "notably robust", Ryanair said, with forward bookings 
and air fares currently into Summer 2023 "strong". 
The airline said it hopes annual traffic will grow 10% in financial 2024 to 185 million.
"Boeing's recent delivery delays may push some of this growth into the lower yielding H2 and may reduce this 
target slightly," it warned. 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair swings to EUR1.44 billion profit as revenue doubles
Earlier this month, Ryanair placed an order for up to 300 new Boeing 737-MAX-10 aircraft, worth around USD40 
billion a list prices. 
In April, Boeing said the model would be hit by delays, after a defect was discovered. When the Ryanair order was 
announced, Boeing's co-chief executive officer said he was "confident" the company will fulfil the order. 
For the current year, Ryanair expects its fuel bill to rise by over EUR1 billion, due to higher oil prices, but its jet fuel 
costs are almost 85% hedged, it said. 
The airline also expects a "modest" increase in unit costs, excluding fuel, due to higher staff costs and increased 
enroute charges. 
"Despite ongoing uncertainty over the timing of Boeing deliveries, almost 15% unhedged fuel, limited [second 
quarter] visibility and zero [second half] fare visibility (normal at this time of year), we are cautiously optimistic that 
[financial 2024] revenue will grow sufficiently to cover our EUR1 billion higher fuel bill and still deliver a modest 
year-on-year profit increase," the Irish carrier said.

Ryanair assessing impact of Boeing 's half in 737 deliveries
Ryanair assessing impact of Boeing's half in 737 deliveries
Alliance News UK

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday that Boeing Co's recent announcement will not affects its current 
fleet of 540 737 aircraft.
"We are assessing with Boeing how this will impact the 24 737 aircraft which are scheduled for delivery in the 
remainder of April, May and June," the Dublin-based budget airline added.
On Friday, US plane maker Boeing warned that production and deliveries of 737 Max, its best-selling plane, will be 
reduced in the near term due to issues with parts supplied by Spirit AeroSystems Holdings.
The problem comes at a time when the airlines worldwide are experiencing a rebound in operations amid the peak 
travel season.
The expected pause in production and deliveries, amid an industry-wide shortage of new jets following the 
pandemic era, is likely to hit Boeing's plan to deliver at least 400 MAXs in 2023.
"We will provide additional information in the days and weeks ahead as we better understand the delivery impacts," 
a company statement said.
The 737 MAX, which is now Boeing's most sought-after model series, was grounded for 20 months following two 
crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people.
The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia were attributed to faulty software. In both cases, a sensor provided incorrect 
data to the software, prompting the plane's nose to dive. Pilots were unable to override the automatic settings.
Ryanair shares closed up 0.6% to EUR14.49 each in Dublin on Friday. Meanwhile, Boeing shares lost 5.5% in New 
York.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Thursday posted traffic growth for February, 
as the travel sector continues its post-Covid-19 bounce. 
Dublin-based Ryanair said passengers numbers in February grew 22% to 10.6 million from 8.7 million a year 
earlier. 
Its load factor improved to 92% from 86%. 
The low-cost airline noted February 2022's outcome was hurt by Omicron travel curbs and the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine. 
In the 12 months to the end of February, passenger numbers were 93% higher at 167.2 million, the carrier said. 
Wizz carried 3.8 million passengers last month, a 97% jump on-year. Capacity was 92% higher at 4.1 million and its 
load factor improved to 93.3% from 91.0%. 
For the rolling 12 months to February, capacity was 74% higher at 56.4 million and passengers numbers jumped 
97% to 49.3 million. 
Ryanair shares were 0.7% lower at EUR14.89 each in Dublin on Thursday morning. In London, Wizz Air shot-up 
4.1% to 2,727.46p.

(Alliance News) - Wizz Air Holdings PLC has been named the worst short-haul airline by UK passengers.
Passengers surveyed by consumer group Which? gave the Hungary-based carrier one star out of five for boarding 
experience, cabin environment and seat comfort.
The budget airline's seat pitch – the difference between two rows in standard economy – is 28 inches, some two 
inches smaller than rival Ryanair.
No more than two stars were awarded in any of the remaining categories, including value for money and 
cleanliness.
Wizz Air operates short-haul flights from eight UK airports including Birmingham, Edinburgh, Gatwick and Luton.
The airline's overall customer score of 48% put it at the bottom of the ranking, below Ryanair Holdings PLC (52%), 
Eurowings (53%) and British Airways (56%).
In December, the Civil Aviation Authority said it has "significant concerns" about Wizz Air's "unacceptable" 
behaviour as its passengers were far more likely to make escalated complaints than those of other carriers.
The regulator also found that the airline was delaying paying money owed to passengers.
Jet2 PLC had the highest score (80%) in the Which? research, ahead of Turkish Airlines (78%).
Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said: "Travellers have had a torrid time in recent years, with last-minute delays 
and cancellations an unacceptably common occurrence.
"While airlines like Jet2.com have distinguished themselves by offering flyers excellent customer care and a reliable 
service, too many of their competitors continually fail to measure up.
Wizz Air named worst short-haul airline by UK passengers
"If alternative carriers are available for your route, avoid Wizz Air, as its poor record on customer care means you're 
likely to be left high and dry in the event your flight is delayed or cancelled."
Which? surveyed 8,046 UK adults in October 2022 about their experiences of flying in the previous two years.
Customer scores for airlines were calculated from a combination of travellers' overall satisfaction and their 
likelihood to recommend.
A Wizz Air spokesman said: "At Wizz Air, we do everything possible to ensure that passengers reach their 
destination on time and with minimal delay.
"Wizz Air operates a fleet of brand new, state-of-the-art Airbus aircraft, with an average age of 4.6 years, which 
offer passengers comfort, space and modern interiors.
"The A321neo features the widest single-aisle cabin configuration with 239 18-inch-wide seats.
"Every aircraft is cleaned after each flight and deep cleaned every night."
A British Airways spokesman said: "We don't feel this small survey, conducted during one of the most challenging 
periods in global aviation, accurately represents the views of the tens of millions of customers who've chosen to fly 
with us over the same period.
"While we don't claim to get everything right every time, we continue to be recognised for the service we offer.
"Our customers tell us they appreciate being able to choose from a range of cabins, flying to and from central 
airports at convenient times of the day, plus our investment in new aircraft, new seating, wifi, new menus, the 
complimentary snacks and water we offer in our short-haul economy cabin, and the most generous hand baggage 
allowance of any UK airline."
Ryanair and Eurowings did not provide a response.

(Alliance News) - January was a month in which winners far outweighed losers in the investment fund space, 
according to findings from QuotedData on Thursday, with China-exposed investors once again among the best-
performers. 
JPMorgan China Growth & Income was among the best-performing trusts, up over 45% in net asset value terms 
over the three months ended January 31. The fund was boosted by the re-opening of the Chinese economy 
following the relaxation of Beijing's zero-Covid policy.
Aurora Investment Trust PLC was the outright best-performing individual stock by NAV in January alone, however. 
This was driven by big jumps in the share prices of its holdings in easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC and Hotel 
Chocolat Group PLC. The investor also benefited from a modest rebound in the share price of its largest position, 
Frasers Group PLC.
In contrast to China, the Indian market lost ground in January, with three of January's worst-performing funds in that 
sector as well as the worst-outright by NAV performance, India Capital Growth Fund Ltd.
Sentiment towards Indian markets was knocked as a short seller attacked one of the nation's largest 
conglomerates, Adani Enterprises Ltd.
Hindenburg Research in January alleged that Adani had used undisclosed related-party transactions and earnings 
manipulation to "maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency" of its listed business units.
Adani has repeatedly denied the allegations and accused the US investment firm of a "maliciously mischievous" 
reputational attack, but nonetheless, its shares have sunk in recent weeks. 
The following were the best and worst performing London-listed investment companies in January, excluding trusts 
with market capitalisations below GBP15 million:

in passengers during January, beating pre-Covid restriction figures of January 2020.
Swords, Dublin-based Ryanair said it carried 11.8 million passengers in January 2023, up 69% from 7.0 million a 
year ago and 9.3% higher than 10.8 million in January 2020, which was the last January with no or minimal Covid

Budapest-based peer Wizz said it carried 4.1 million passengers in January 2023, up 73% year-on-year from 2.4 
million and beating January 2020's figure of 3.2 million passengers by 32%. Last month's load factor grew to 86% 
from 80% a year ago, but fell short of 90% it reported for January 2020.
January's capacity increased by 60% to 4.8 million seats from 3.0 million seats and beat January 2020's capacity of 
3.5 million by 38%.
On a rolling 12-months basis, Wizz Air's capacity climbed 76% to 54.5 million seats from GBP31.0 million seats at 
January 31, 2022. This beat January 2020's 43.1 million by 26%. Passenger figures more than doubled to 47.4 
million from 23.5 million a year ago and were 17% higher than 40.4 million in January 2020.
Wizz plans new flights to Istanbul, Antalya and Dalaman, connecting these three cities in Turkey with Hungary, 
Romania, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK, starting in March. 
Ryanair shares were up 2.7% to EUR15.33 each on Thursday morning, while Wizz shares were up 4.3% at 
2,767.00 pence.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a swing to third-quarter profit, with results boosted by 
higher prices and stronger demand over the Christmas period. 
The Dublin-based budget airline posted revenue of EUR2.31 billion in the three months to December 31, up 57% 
from EUR1.47 billion a year earlier. 
Ryanair swung to a pretax profit of EUR212.8 million from a EUR132.8 million loss. It reported a net profit before 
exceptional items of EUR211 million, swinging from a loss of EUR96 million. 
The company hailed "strong travel demand" over the festive period and said fares were 14% higher than pre-Covid 
levels. 
Customer numbers surged 24% on-year to 38.4 million from 31.1 million. Ryanair's load factor improved to 93% 
from 84%. 
Ryanair expects traffic of 168 million for all of financial 2023, which ends on March 31, up from the 97.1 million in 
financial 2022. 
The company still put its pre-exceptional items net profit guidance range to EUR1.33 billion to EUR1.43 billion. That 
guidance was lifted from EUR1.00 billion to EUR1.20 billion earlier in January. 
It would represent a swing from a EUR355 million loss in financial 2022. 
It expects to be loss-making in the fourth-quarter, however, due to when Easter falls in 2023.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday announced record bookings driven by UK consumers planning 
foreign trips for Easter and summer.
Ryanair is a low-cost airline based in Swords in County Dublin, Republic of Ireland.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the airline received 2.0 million flight bookings last weekend, beating the 
carrier's previous record weekend of 1.6 million in early 2019 when seats were heavily discounted.
O'Leary told reporters at a press conference in the City of London: "Yes, there's lots of cheap seats out there, but 
it's not on the back of a seat sale. There just seems to be very strong demand out there."
"People are worrying that prices are going to rise in the summer – which I think they will. People are getting in early 
and booking their Easter and summer travel."
O'Leary said he expects average fares to rise this year by "the high single digits" in percentage terms compared 
with 2022, while he does not believe fares as low as GBP9.99 will return "for the next year or two" due to high oil 
prices.
He attributed the strong booking performance, despite the cost-of-living crisis, to people deciding to "scrimp and 
save" elsewhere to "protect their holiday".
"One of the things that has emerged out of Covid is the annual holiday, or the second holiday, or the week in the 
sun, is no longer being considered by many to be a luxury that we can drop," he said.
O'Leary added that the pandemic has "accelerated the consolidation process" in the airline sector.
He believes that eventually easyJet "is going to finish up being bought by either British Airways or Air France, or 
both jointly".
Ryanair in record bookings as consumers plan Easter and summer trips
Earlier this month, Ryanair increased its profit forecast, as a strong Christmas season meant the airline now 
expects profit after tax to reach between a little over EUR1.3 billion and EUR1.4 billion, or GBP1.1 billion and 
GBP1.2 billion during the financial year ending March 31.
That is an increase from the EUR1 billion to EUR1.2 billion range, or GBP880 million to GBP1.06 billion, that the 
company had previously supplied to shareholders.
Ryanair shares were 0.5% lower at EUR14.73 each on Tuesday afternoon in Dublin.

Strike to cause 152 Ryanair flight cancellations in Belgium

(Alliance News) - A fresh strike by Ryanair Holdings PLC aircrew in Belgium will result in 152 flight cancellations 
this weekend at the country's second airport, Charleroi, the airport boss told AFP on Friday.
The stoppage by the 400 flight attendants based in Belgium for the Irish low-cost carrier – the biggest in Europe in 
terms of passengers transported – follows on from one over the New Year last weekend.
That caused around a hundred flight cancellations at Charleroi, which Ryanair uses at its main hub in the country.
The fresh strike on Saturday and Sunday is expected to lead to 76 outgoing and 76 incoming flights being 
cancelled, affected "some 20,000 passengers", Charleroi airport boss Philippe Verdonck said.
He said all those affected passengers had been notified by Ryanair.
The airline runs 15 aircraft out of Belgium, and the strike was only to affect those planes, and not ones it operates 
out of other European countries.
The head of the CNE union covering Ryanair staff, Didier Lebbe, said the employees would gather early on 
Saturday at Charleroi airport.
Ryanair employees staged several strikes in 2022. 
They notably accuse the airline of illegally pressuring some of them to fill in at bases in other European countries, 
especially in Dublin.
And they allege Ryanair is not correctly declaring them in the Belgian social security system and sometimes pays 
wages below the national legal minimum.
Ryanair on Wednesday said it forecast a higher post-tax profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, citing stronger-
than-expected travel demand and revenues over the end-of-year holiday period.

(Alliance News) - Air travel in Germany is recovering more slowly than in other European countries, an industry 
association said on Friday.
For the first half of 2023, the number of seats on offer looks set to reach around 78% of the 2019 figure before the 
pandemic broke out, according to the German Aviation Association (BDL).
However, other European countries are already offering 94% of the pre-pandemic level, the group said.
That is partly due to a lower level of domestic air travel, at 56% of pre-pandemic flight capacity, the group said.
But it is also because low-cost airlines are giving most German airports a wide berth as they ramp up their offerings 
elsewhere. Current flight plans show that the number of connections from German airports is down more than a 
third compared to before the pandemic.
However, some low-cost point-to-point airlines such as Ryanair or Wizz have significantly expanded the number of 
flights they are offering since the pandemic in the rest of Europe outside of Germany, with 114% of the 2019 level.
Of all Germany's larger airports, only four - Dortmund, Hahn, Karlsruhe and Memmingen - will have more flights 
available than in the same period in 2019. All are used by lower-cost airlines.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary had criticized German airports in the past for their high fees and announced plans to 
grow in other markets.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday reported it carried more passengers in December 
compared to a year earlier.
The Dublin-based low-cost airline said its December traffic rose 21% to 11.5 million guests from 9.5 million in 
December 2021. 
The load factor improved to 92% from 81% a year earlier. 
On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers more than doubled to 160.4 million guests from a year ago and 
load factor the load factor rose to 92%, from 81%. 
The announcement came days after Ryanair cabin crews launched a three-day strike over the New Year holiday, 
grounding dozens of flights and hitting thousands of passengers. 
The industrial action came as the cost of living crisis spurs growing labour strife across Europe that has disrupted 
the festive period.
Charleroi airport Chief Executive Philippe Verdonck told AFP that the strike action would set to halt 30% of the 
airlines' flights through its Belgium hub. 
Overall, some 22,000 passengers were expected to be affected over the three days, he said. 
In early December, Ryanair said it carried 11.2 million passengers in November 2022, up 9.8% from 10.2 million a 
year earlier, and up 2.8% from 10.9 million in November 2019.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC late on Wednesday raised its full-year profit guidance on a strong 
performance over the Christmas and New Year's Eve period.
The Dublin-based low-cost airline said that it expects a stronger-than-expected third-quarter performance, due to 
strong pent-up travel demand over the holiday season. 
The company noted that no damage from Covid or the war in Ukraine lead to strong Christmas and New Year traffic 
and fares. Ryanair's third quarter ends on December 31.
The firm now expects full-year post-tax profit in the range of EUR1.33 billion to EUR1.43 billion, up from an initial 
forecast of 1 billion to 1.2 billion euros.
For the third quarter that ended on December 31, it expects to report post-tax profit of as close to EUR200 million. 
However, the budget airline noted in a statement that the reassessment was "heavily dependent" on avoiding 
further fallout from "adverse events" such as Covid or the ongoing war in Ukraine.
Earlier on Wednesday, Ryanair said its December traffic rose 21% to 11.5 million guests from 9.5 million in 
December 2021.
The load factor improved to 92% from 81% a year earlier.
On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers more than doubled to 160.4 million guests from a year ago and 
load factor the load factor rose to 92%, from 81%. 
It will publish its third-quarter results on January 30.

(Alliance News) - Belgian-based Ryanair Holdings PLC cabin crews on Friday launched a three-day strike over the 
New Year holiday, grounding dozens of flights and hitting thousands of passengers. 
The industrial action comes as the cost of living crisis spurs growing labour strife across Europe that has disrupted 
the festive period.
Charleroi airport CEO Philippe Verdonck told AFP 48 outgoing and incoming Ryanair flights had been cancelled on 
Friday, with the action set to halt 30% of the airlines' flights through its Belgium hub. 
Overall some 22,000 passengers were expected to be affected over the three days, he said. 
The low-cost Irish carrier has 15 planes in Belgium and the strike was not due to impact its aircraft based in other 
countries. 
Ryanair employees in Belgium have already gone on strike several times this year to demand that the country's

The unions notably accused Ryanair of illegally pressuring staff in Belgium to work from time to time in other sites 
across Europe, particularly in its home base Dublin, where the airline suffers employee shortages.
They also allege Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline in terms of passengers transported, is not properly declaring 
salaries to Belgian social security authorities and sometimes paying wages under the national legal minimum.
The unions are also planning to strike over the weekend of January 7 and 8 at the end of Belgium's traditional 
winter break.

(Alliance News) - Belgian-based cabin crews of Ryanair Holdings PLC will strike on and around New Year, unions 
said Friday, adding to growing labour strife in Europe that threatens a rocky holiday period for many passengers.
Most of the 450 flight attendants based in Belgium for Ryanair, the low-cost Irish carrier, have been called to stop 
work on December 30, 31 and January 1 – over a New Year's weekend that is expected to be very busy.
They also plan to strike on the following weekend, on January 7 and 8, the CNE and AVC Puls unions said.
The strike will mainly hit Ryanair's Belgium hub at Charleroi airport, south of Brussels, and is likely to cause several 
flight cancellations.
It will affect the 15 planes Ryanair bases in Belgium, CNE permanent secretary Didier Lebbe told AFP, predicting 
that it would halve the number of flights the airline runs into and out of the country.
Ryanair planes based in other countries won't be affected, he said.
Ryanair is Europe's biggest airline in terms of passengers transported.
The announced strike adds to promised travel chaos in Britain and France, where rail workers stopped work on 
Friday and over this Christmas weekend to demand higher wages to offset high inflation. 
British Border Force officers manning passport booths went on strike for the rest of the year, except December 27, 
including up to and including New Year's Eve.
Ryanair employees in Belgium have already gone on strike several times this year to demand that Belgium labour 
laws be fully applied, grounding aircraft.

"We want Ryanair to respect Belgian law and stop its aggressive and awful policy towards its own staff," Lebbe 
said, also urging the Belgian government to sue the Irish airline.
The unions notably accused Ryanair of illegally pressuring staff in Belgium to work from time to time in other bases 
across Europe, particularly in Dublin, where the airline suffers employee shortages.
They also allege Ryanair is not properly declaring salaries to Belgian social security authorities and was sometimes 
paying wages under the national legal minimum.
Ryanair shares fell 1.3% to EUR12.59 each on Friday afternoon.

Ryanair Holdings PLC - Dublin-based low-cost airline - Signs a four-year pay deal with the Forsa union and its Irish 
pilots under which Ryanair's Irish pilots will receive a restoration of pay cuts agreed during the Covid-19 pandemic 
in this month's payroll. Says the deal also includes three years of pay increases over four years to March 2027. 
Ryanair People Director Darrell Hughes says: "We welcome this pay restoration agreement with Forsa and our Irish 
pilots which will see pay cuts previously agreed during Covid restored in the Dec payroll in time for Christmas. This 
agreement which includes annual pay increases for the next 4 years now brings our Irish pilots into line with similar 
pay restoration deals concluded with our other pilot unions across Europe over the past 9 months."
Earlier this month, Court of Appeal found in favour of the UK Civil Aviation Authority against Ryanair, deciding that 
strike action by airline staff did not absolve Ryanair of liability for delays and cancellations. As a result, the Court of 
Appeal said Ryanair should provide compensation to passengers affected by a Ryanair pilot strike in 2018.

UK's Civil Aviation Authority slams 'unacceptable' Wizz Air behaviour
UK's Civil Aviation Authority slams 'unacceptable' Wizz Air behaviour

(Alliance News) - Wizz Air Holdings PLC has been slammed by UK's aviation regulator for "unacceptable" 
behaviour as its passengers are far more likely to make escalated complaints than those of other airlines.
The Civil Aviation Authority said it has "significant concerns" about the Hungarian airline, which is also delaying 
paying money owed to passengers.
Some 811 grievances per million Wizz Air passengers on UK flights were brought to independent bodies between 
July and September.
With the exception of Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd which had 555 escalated complaints per million passengers, 
the rates for all other airlines were fewer than half of Wizz Air's.
Escalated complaint rates per million passengers at other airlines included easyJet PLC at 245, Ryanair Holdings 
PLC at 235 and International Consolidated Airlines Group SA's British Airways at 166.
The figures relate to complaints taken to either Alternative Dispute Resolution, or ADR, schemes or the CAA by 
passengers unhappy with an airline's response to their initial report of a problem.
Many airlines and airports are members of ADR bodies, which are independent third parties that consider facts and 
make binding decisions.
CAA Head of Consumer Policy & Enforcement Anna Bowles said passengers have "every right" to expect their 
complaints and claims to be resolved "quickly and efficiently", and to be "treated fairly" by airlines.
Wizz Air's delays in processing and paying claims, combined with the "large number" of county court judgments 
made against it, has "raised significant concerns for the CAA", she explained.
UK's Civil Aviation Authority slams 'unacceptable' Wizz Air behaviour
Bowles went on: "We have made it clear to Wizz Air that its behaviour is unacceptable and that we expect overdue 
complaints and claims to be resolved in advance of Christmas.
"We understand the payment of county court judgments may continue into January, but we are encouraging Wizz 
Air to ensure that the payment of these is also prioritised.
"We will continue to monitor the situation."
She added the CAA "won't hesitate to take further action" where it has evidence that an airline is "letting 
passengers down".
Wizz Air said in a statement: "We are deeply sorry for the inconvenience we have caused our customers and we 
are working hard to put things right and resolve all outstanding claims as quickly as possible.
"The major disruption we navigated last summer meant that we have been dealing with an unprecedented number 
of claims.
"Despite this, 91% of claims have already been processed.
"We have recently doubled the size of our customer services team and are working continuously to process all 
outstanding customer claims, Alternative Dispute Resolution claims and settle all county court judgments."
It added that customers pursuing claims should check the spam folders of their email accounts for messages from 
the airline as "this has held up settlement being made in a number of cases".
Wizz Air operates short-haul flights from 10 UK airports including Belfast International, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Gatwick 
and Luton.
Analysis by the PA news agency published in August found that it was the worst airline for flight delays from UK 
airports last year.
The carrier's UK departures were an average of 14 minutes and 24 seconds behind schedule in 2021.
Wizz Air shares fell 4.6% to 2,141.00 pence each on Friday afternoon in London.

(Alliance News) - The UK Civil Aviation Authority on Monday said Ryanair Holdings PLC has decided not to appeal 
a Supreme Court decision on passenger compensation in the case of a pilot strike back in 2018.
The Dublin-based low-cost airline decided against an appeal after initially securing permission to appeal the 
decision by the Court of Appeal in January, according to the regulator, meaning affect passengers now can claim 
compensation.
The Court of Appeal found in favour of the UK CAA's action against Ryanair, deciding that strike action by airline 
staff did not absolve Ryanair of liability. As a result, the Court of Appeal said Ryanair should provide compensation 
to passengers affected by Ryanair pilot strike action in 2018.
"The Civil Aviation Authority undertook enforcement action against Ryanair due to the belief that strike action by 
airline staff does not constitute an 'extraordinary circumstance' and, as such, affected passengers should be entitled 
to compensation where this results in the delay or short notice cancellation of their flight. The judgment by the Court 
of Appeal supported this view," said UK CAA Consumer Director Paul Smith.
Smith continued: "We would encourage all passengers on flights that were affected to claim the compensation they 
are entitled to."
Shares in Ryanair were quoted at EUR13.11 on the Deutsche Borse Xetra exchange on Monday afternoon, down 
0.8%.

Ryanair boss accuses French controllers of 'recreational' strikes

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC boss Michael O'Leary has accused French air traffic controllers of carrying 
out "recreational" strikes during the summer months.
During a committee appearance before Irish politicians, the budget airline boss suggested that air traffic controller 
strikes happen on a Friday so that workers can get a three-day weekend.
Among the various charged comments he made during a three-hour committee appearance, he called on the 
European Commission to change laws so that only domestic French flights would be affected during air traffic 
controller strikes and that overflights would be protected.
Mr O'Leary also called on the proposed single European sky to be implemented, but said the European 
Commission "lacks the bottle" that earlier commissions had "to challenge the vested interests of the national 
governments".
In July, flights from French airports faced disruption as airport workers went on strike to demand salary rises to 
keep up with inflation.
They also called for a recruitment drive to deal with resurgent travel demand, which has put both airports and 
airlines under pressure this year after jobs were cut during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Speaking during an appearance before an Irish transport committee on Wednesday, Mr O'Leary accused French air 
traffic controllers of "recreational" striking.
"Many times, French air traffic controllers go on strike not because they want more pay, it's because they don't like 
(French President Emmanuel) Macron, or they didn't like the result of the football match… it's recreational striking.
"All the strikes generally take place on Fridays, and then they don't show up to work on the Saturday so they have a 
three-day weekend."
Ryanair boss accuses French controllers of 'recreational' strikes
He said that when French air traffic controllers go on strike, the French government uses minimum service 
legislation to protect French domestic flights.
"So, the French are all happily flying around the place. But it's the poor Irish, the Spanish, the Italians and the 
Germans who are taking all of the cancellations.
"Our people, our citizens, our visitors are being completely screwed over while a bunch of French air traffic 
controllers go on strike – and we fully respect their right to go on strike – but let the French take the hit.
"It shouldn't be Irish, Germans, Italians and Spanish who are not travelling to France (who) take the hit."
He added: "It is bizarre that Europe's free movement of people across Europe in a single market is allowed to be 
threatened by the French every time they have these recreational strikes, which they have frequently in the 
summer."
Mr O'Leary then called for a single European sky to be implemented – a proposal from 2001 – and accused the 
European Commission of not having the courage to implement it.
"The technology now exists to allow us to fly straight, we should be allowed to fly straight, we would burn less fuel, 
we would reduce our impact on the environment and we would pass on enormous savings to our customers."
"In other words, they move to the same air traffic control system as America has, one system operate by all."
"The difficulty is that it's opposed by every single air traffic controllers' national union because it means less jobs for 
them, and therefore they can't get national governments to agree to it."
He added: "The European Commission lacks the bottle that those earlier Commissions had to challenge the vested 
interests of the national governments."
"Nobody will European Commission wants to challenge the French government or the German government, even if 
it's in the interests of the vast and overwhelming majority of European citizens and passengers."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday posted half-year results that showed profit, revenue and 
passengers carried all exceeding pre-pandemic levels. 
The Dublin-based budget airline said that, in the six months to September 30, revenue trebled year-on-year to 
EUR6.62 billion from EUR2.15 billion. The recent figure was 23% higher than EUR5.39 billion three years ago, 
meaning before the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Ryanair swung to an interim pretax profit of EUR1.55 billion from a EUR99.9 million loss in the first financial half of 
2021. This beat pre-pandemic profit of EUR1.26 billion. 
Earnings per share rose to EUR1.11 from EUR1.02 three years ago and swung from a loss of EUR0.04 a year ago. 
Ryanair carried 95.1 million customers during the recent six months, more than doubled from 39.1 million a year 
before and exceeding 85.7 million three years ago. The load factor improved to 94% from 79% a year prior but was 
below 96% three years ago. 
Ryanair raised its traffic guidance for its current financial year, which ends on March 31, to 168 million passengers, 
up 13% from 148.6 million three years ago and up 71% from 97.1 million in financial 2022. 
Looking ahead, Ryanair said bookings are strong but the economic situation is "fragile". It also noted that the key 
Easter holiday will be on April 9 and so fall into financial 2024.
"The recovery for the remainder of financial year 2023 remains fragile and could yet be impacted by new Covid 
variants or adverse geopolitical events such as Ukraine. However forward bookings, both traffic and fares remain 
strong over the October school mid-terms and into the peak Christmas travel period. We hope to avoid any repeat 
of last year's Omicron lockdowns which damaged last Christmas at such short notice," Ryanair said.

(Alliance News) - European budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday said that 
passenger numbers have begun to slow after the summer season, but year-on-year growth remains strong.
Ryanair carried 15.9 million passengers in September, up 49% from 10.6 million last year. Load factor was 94% up 
from 81% year-on-year.
However, this is down from August, when the Irish airline recorded 16.9 million passengers and a load factor of 
96%.
The company also said it operated over 88,850 flights in September, down from 92,800 flights in August. 
Passenger numbers for the rolling 12 months to September surged to 153.0 million from 44.0 million a year earlier. 
On a rolling 12-month basis, load factor was 90% compared to 77%
The year-on-year growth in September comes despite Ryanair being faced with strike action in Spain over the 
summer.
The USO and SITCPLA unions called for a third wave of 24-hour work stoppages from August 8 until January 7, 
2023, arguing that Ryanair has refused "to engage in any dialogue". However, Ryanair said the unions only 
represent a small number of its Spanish crew. 
For Wizz Air, passengers in September totalled 4.6 million, up 52% from 3.0 million a year earlier. Load factor was 
up to 87% from 79% year-on-year.
This is down from August, when the Budapest-based airline carried 5.0 million passengers and had a load factor of 
91%.

Hungary 's government launches investigation against Wizz Air
Hungary's government launches investigation against Wizz Air

(Alliance News) - Hungary's government has ordered an investigation of domestic low-cost carrier Wizz Air 
Holdings PLC over what it calls possible breaches of consumer protection laws.
It is the second such investigation it has launched against an airline since June.
The probe, ordered by Hungary's Ministry of Justice, comes after the ministry said it received an increase in 
complaints against the Budapest-based airline over its failure to provide information and assistance to customers 
whose flights are delayed or cancelled, according to Hungary's state news agency MTI.
Other complaints included Wizz Air failing to provide accommodation and rebooking for affected passengers, failure 
to respond to consumer complaints within 30 days and operating a paid customer service line, which violates 
Hungarian law and consumer rights, the ministry said in a statement.
It is the second investigation against an airline launched by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government 
since June, when it announced it would impose windfall taxes on industries from banking to insurance to airlines 
that have enjoyed "extra profits" arising from soaring demand after the pandemic - a claim some companies have 
contested.
Earlier this month, Hungary accused budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC of consumer protection violations and 
fined it more than EUR750,000 after the company raised ticket prices to cope with the new tax, which Ryanair CEO 
Michael O'Leary has called "highway robbery" and "idiotic".
The government hopes to raise HUF815 billion from the tax policy to see the country through a period of soaring 
inflation and energy prices, and budget shortfalls from pre-election handouts earlier this year in which Orban won a 
fourth consecutive term.
Wizz Air did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, Hungary's Ministry of Justice said the aim of the procedure is to "detect, stop and sanction any 
possible illegal behaviour, since all businesses must comply with the law".
Shares in Wizz Air were down 7.8% at 2,147.56 pence in London on Monday.

(Alliance News) - Fourteen international flights were cancelled Friday as Easyjet PLC's Spanish pilots began a new 
three-day work stoppage calling for the reinstatement of conditions they enjoyed before the pandemic, union 
officials said. 
Coming at the height of the summer tourist season, the new Easyjet stoppages only add problems to a sector 
struggling with rolling strikes by cabin crew at budget rival Ryanair that began in June and will continue until 
January. 
Easyjet shares were down 3.6% to 393.96 pence each in London on Friday afternoon. 
Six of the Easyjet cancellations affected flights flying into or out of Barcelona, while the other eight involved arrivals 
and departures from Palma de Mallorca in the Balearic Isles, the SEPLA union said in an update at 1130 GMT. 
"These are international flights to or from Geneva, Milan, Paris, London or Basel," the union said. 
Easyjet pilots began their first three-day strike on August 12, prompting the cancellation of 36 flights in and out of 
Barcelona, Malaga and the Balearic Islands. 
A third strike is scheduled to take place from August 27-29. 
The strike began just two weeks after the airline's cabin crew went on strike, resulting in a deal.
The pilots are demanding the restoration of conditions they enjoyed before the pandemic and the resumption of 
talks for a new collective agreement.
During the pandemic they had agreed to a pay cut to ensure "not only our jobs but the survival of the company itself 
in Spain," the union explained on August 12, saying Easyjet had refused to restore their pre-Covid working 
conditions.

The rolling strike by Ryanair staff has so far had a limited impact, involving more delays than flight cancellations. 
Cabin crew at Iberia Express, the low-cost arm of Spain's Iberia national carrier, are also expected to stage a 10-
day strike from August 28 to September 6, the USO union has said.

(Alliance News) - easyJet PLC's Spanish pilots walked out on Friday, calling for the reinstatement of conditions they 
enjoyed before the coronavirus pandemic, two weeks after a strike by the low-cost carrier's cabin crew had resulted 
in a deal.
Coming at the height of the summer tourist season, the new easyJet stoppages will add to the problems facing the 
sector.
Cabin crew at budget rival Ryanair Holdings PLC have been staging 24-hour walkouts since June, which are likely 
to continue until January 2023, unions said.
The easyJet pilots, for their part, are staging a first three-day strike from Friday at the airports of Barcelona, Malaga 
and the Mediterranean islands of Palma de Majorca and Minorca, the SEPLA union said.
Two more three-day walkouts are planned later in August.
"This is the only possible alternative for the pilots' representatives, after more than six months of negotiations, at 
which the company has rejected all proposals made," the union said.
The airline cancelled eight flights on Friday, most of them from Barcelona, Spain's second-busiest airport.
"During the worst months of the pandemic, we agreed to lower our salaries to guarantee not only jobs, but the 
survival of the company itself in Spain," the union said. 
Now, however, the company "refuses to recover the working conditions.
"We are not asking for anything that we did not have two years ago," said a union spokesman. 
In late July, easyJet said it took a sizeable financial hit from sector-wide disruptions, notably staff shortages, but still 
slashed quarterly losses as demand recovered.

Just days later, easyJet cabin crews ended their strike, after reaching a deal with management to raise wages by 
22% over three years.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC's trademark EUR1 and EUR10 fares will not be seen for a "number of 
years" due to soaring fuel prices, the budget airline's boss has said.
In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Michael O'Leary said he expected Ryanair's average fare to 
rise by about EUR10 over the next five years, from around EUR40 last year to roughly EUR50 by 2027.
He told the broadcaster: "There's no doubt that at the lower end of the marketplace, our really cheap promotional 
fares – the EUR1 fares, the EUR0.99 fares, even the EUR9.99 fares – I think you will not see those fares for the 
next number of years."
Although the soaring fuel prices which are impacting the airline's fares are also wreaking havoc on people's 
disposable incomes, O'Leary is confident the number of customers will remain steady.
Instead, he believes travellers will flock en masse to lower-cost alternatives such as Ryanair and easyJet PLC.
"We think people will continue to fly frequently," he said.
"But I think people are going to become much more price sensitive and therefore my view of life is that people will 
trade down in their many millions."

(Alliance News) - The start of a long-planned strike by Ryanair Holdings PLC cabin crew in Spain caused only 
limited disruption at the country's airports.
Ten flights had been cancelled on Monday and there had been 111 delays by the afternoon, the USO trade union 
said.
The Dublin-based budget airline predicted that operations over the months ahead would be disrupted minimally if at 
all.
Ryanair's Spain-based cabin crew are demanding an improvement in working conditions. Following unsuccessful 
strike action in June and July, the unions involved, USO and Sitcpla, said crew would strike between Monday and 
Thursday every week from Monday up to January 7 next year.
They accused Ryanair of failing to comply with Spanish law in refusing to negotiate.
Among the demands are observing "basic labour rights," including at least 22 days' holiday per year, 
implementation of occupational health and safety legislation and raising pay to the level that applied before the 
pandemic.
The airports affected include the main hubs at Madrid, Barcelona and Mallorca, and also Malaga, Sevilla, Alicante, 
Valencia, Girona, Ibiza and Santiago de Compostela.
The maintenance of "minimal service" prescribed under Spanish law during strikes means that only some flights 
can be cancelled, usually only a relatively small number.

(Alliance News) -  Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday recorded sharp traffic growth in July, flying 2 million more 
passengers than it did the same month before the Covid-10 pandemic.
The Dublin-based budget airline said passenger numbers surged by 81% to 16.8 million last month from 9.3 million 
a year earlier. Ryanair's July passenger numbers were its best so far this year, eclipsing June's 15.9 million. The 
latest figure also topped July 2019's pre-pandemic total of 14.8 million.
Ryanair said it operated 92,300 flights in July.
Rolling annual passenger numbers to July more than tripled to 142.0 million, from 40.0 million a year before.
Load factor last month was 96%, up slightly from 95% in June and greatly improved from 80% a year ago. On a 
rolling 12-month basis, load factor was 87%, up from 74% a year before.
The figures come as airports in the UK and Europe have suffered from long passenger queues, flight cancellations 
and delays, and lost luggage. Carriers, which cut jobs in the wake of the Covid pandemic, have struggled to cope 
with the quick pick-up in demand as restrictions were eased.
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.5% to EUR12.56 each in Dublin on Wednesday around midday.

(Alliance News) - easyJet PLC flight crews ended a strike on Thursday after reaching a deal with management that 
raises wages by over a fifth, the USO trade union said.
The union launched at the beginning of the month a series of nine strike days at the Barcelona, Malaga and 
Majorca airports to obtain raises and better working conditions.
The strikes forced the low-cost British airline to cancel and delay flights at the beginning of the peak European 
summer vacation season.
USO said that a staff assembly had approved the deal, which will see flight crews get a 22% pay hike spread over 
three years, as well as special compensation for working on scheduled days off.
Remaining strike days planned for July 29, 30 and 31 have been cancelled.
Irish budget airline Ryanair has also been hit by strikes in Spain.
Strikes by airline and airport staff across Europe have led to misery for travellers as the aviation industry was 
hoping a bumper summer season would help make up two dismal years due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The industry had slashed jobs due to the pandemic and had difficulty rehiring staff to handle the boom in travellers, 
while staff complain that wages and working conditions need to improve.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a sharp rise in first-quarter revenue, beating pre-Covid 
numbers and sending the budget airline back into profit, even as Easter bookings and fares were badly damaged by 
the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February.
For the three months to June 30, revenue was EUR2.60 billion, multiplied from EUR370 million in the first quarter 
last year. This helped swing the Dublin-based carrier to a profit after tax of EUR170 million from a EUR273 million 
loss a year before. However, the firm noted this was below its pre-Covid profit of EUR243 million in the first quarter 
of its financial year 2020, which ended June 30, 2019. 
Notably, the airline counted more passengers in the quarter to June 30 and higher revenue than in the quarter to 
June 30, 2019. Customer numbers were up 7.9% to 45.5 million from 41.9 million. 
Revenue increased 13% to EUR2.60 billion from EUR2.31 billion three years ago. The load factor however was 
lower at 92% from 96%. 
Average fares were down 4% on the same quarter pre-Covid, but ancillary revenue continued to perform strongly, 
delivering over EUR22.50 per passenger, Ryanair noted.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it could not "ignore the risk" of new Covid variants in autumn. The Dublin-based carrier 
pointed to its experience with Omicron last November and the Ukraine invasion to demonstrate how "fragile the air 
travel market remains". Ryanair said the strength of any recovery will be dependent on there being no adverse or 
unexpected developments over the remainder of financial 2023.
The airline said it is "clear signs of pent-up demand". Average fares in the second quarter of its financial year are 
tracking ahead of pre-Covid levels by a low double-digit percentage, having been 4% down in the first quarter.
However, bookings remain closer-in than normal, leaving the company with "almost zero visibility into H2".

(Alliance News) - Due to a threatened work stoppage at Italian airports, travellers have to be prepared for delays 
and cancellations of numerous flights on Sunday.
Several trade unions called on staff of the air traffic control company ENAV as well as the low-cost airlines Ryanair 
Holdings PLC, easyJet PLC and Volotea to take part in the four-hour work stoppage, according to notices from the 
trade union confederations.
The reason is a dispute over workers' rights, working conditions and the payment of minimum wages in the 
industry.
easyJet has cancelled flights from Milan's Linate airport to Berlin and from Rome-Fiumicino to Amsterdam because 
of the strike. Ryanair said it had been forced to cancel some flights because of the strike at ENAV. Passengers had 
already been informed, the airline said.
According to ENAV, the work stoppage will last from 2 pm to 6 pm local time. Flights between 7 am and 10 am and 
6 pm to 9 pm will not be affected.
With work stoppages looming, Italy Tourism Minister Massimo Garavaglia called during the week for everything to 
be done to avoid inconvenience in the recovering sector.
"An unrest among air traffic control staff threatens to block the most dynamic sector of the economy, which is 
currently driving the country's growth to a significant extent. To block transport is to block the country," said the 
politician from the far-right Lega party, which is considered pro-business.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline easyJet PLC on Monday announced the resignation of Chief Operating Officer 
Peter Bellew after a pandemic bounce-back marred by flight cancellations and travel chaos. 
He will be replaced on an interim basis by David Morgan, who had once held the role for a year in 2019. Bellew has 
resigned "to pursue other business opportunities", easyJet said.
Bellew had been part of the Luton Airport-based budget airline for three years since 2019. Prior to that, Bellew had 
rejoined Ryanair Holdings PLC in late 2017, having been chief executive officer of Malaysia Airlines. He previously 
had been had been director of flight operations for Ryanair until 2014.
Airlines have been scrambling this year to meet pent-up demand for travel post-Covid, particularly in the peak 
school holiday periods. However, easyJet has come under significant pressure has it has been one of the worst hit 
for cancellations in recent months.
The company has blamed air traffic control delays, staff shortages in ground handling and at airports and increased 
ID check times. 
Last month, easyJet said it was "proactively" cancelling flights at Gatwick in response to a cap introduced by the 
airport and warned there would be a cost impact from recent disruption and the measures taken to combat it.
Chief Executive Johan Lundgren apologised at that time, saying easyJet was "sorry that for some customers we 
have not been able to deliver the service they have come to expect from us".
Lundgren on Monday commenting on Bellew's departure said: "I would like to thank Peter for his hard work and 
wish him well. Everyone at easyJet remains absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this 
summer. I am pleased that Operations will be in the very capable hands of David Morgan who can move 
seamlessly into this role having previously led the operation, as interim chief operating officer, throughout 2019."

(Alliance News) - More than 50 Ryanair Holdings PLC flights to and from Spain were cancelled on Thursday and 
several hundred others delayed during a strike by the low-cost airline's cabin staff. 
The strike which took place as European schools were breaking up for the summer was the latest stoppage by 
European airline staff demanding better conditions. 
By 8:00 pm, 54 flights had been cancelled and more than 300 delayed, with the airports in Barcelona and Malaga 
worst-hit, the USO union said. 
Although Ryanair had said all scheduled flights would be operating, the airline "had not called in the full crew" at 
certain airports.
"The crew members that were not called in have joined the strike while those that were, went to the airports.. but 
there were not enough of them to operate the flights," it said. 
The strike by Ryanair cabin crew in Spain, where there are some 1,900 employees, is affecting 10 of the airline 
bases in the country and is due to run until July 2.
Earlier, the airline said flight disruption through the strike was "minimal" and only affected three percent of its 
Spanish flights.
The employees, who are demanding better working conditions, began an initial three-day strike on June 24 during 
which 129 Spanish flights were cancelled, the union said. 
Ryanair is the airline that transports the most passengers in the Spanish market, offering more than 650 routes to 
27 airports, the company says. 
The initial strike in Spain coincided with industrial action by the airline's staff in Portugal, Belgium, Italy and France 
demanding respect for labour rights and higher wages.

On Friday, staff with rival low-cost airline EasyJet will also be striking for the first of three weekends in July

(Alliance News) - The EU Court of Justice on Wednesday dismissed a Ryanair Holdings PLC case seeking to annul 
Covid-19 aid granted to Finnish state-owned airline Finnair.
The complaint was part of a string of more than 20 court cases brought by the Dublin-based airline during the 
pandemic.
Ryanair has sought to undo the massive bailouts of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Air France KLM SA and other 
major EU airlines, with varying success.
Finnair was granted over EUR1 billion in aid as part of Finland's measures to support the economy during Covid-19.
"The action seeking annulment of the decision by the [European] Commission to approve aid granted by Finland to 
the airline Finnair is dismissed in its entirety," the EU court said.
Finnair told AFP that the "matter has undergone thorough scrutiny in the EU, and the court ruling is in line with our 
expectations". 
Criticising the bailouts as "discriminatory", Ryanair – Europe's biggest airline in terms of passenger numbers --
 claimed that the aid gives a "leg up" for airlines based on their nationality.
"The Covid-19 crisis has caused damage to all airlines," Ryanair said in a statement.
The Court of Justice of the EU has ruled in Ryanair's favour against Dutch airline KLM and Portugal's TAP, but 
dismissed cases against Austrian Airlines and Stockholm-based SAS.

(Alliance News) - South Africa on Tuesday said it was surprised at Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC's 
"backward profiling" of passengers, who were given a pre-travel test in Afrikaans to prove they were legitimate 
passport holders.
The airline has admitted it imposed a requirement for South Africans flying to Britain and Ireland to fill out a 
questionnaire issued in Afrikaans "due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports".
Passengers who fail to complete the questionnaire are denied travel and fully refunded for their tickets.
Afrikaans, just one of 11 official languages in South Africa, is commonly used by around 12% of the country's 
population of nearly 60 million, and played a controversial role in the oppression of black citizens during apartheid. 
South Africa's Department of Home Affairs said in a statement: "We are taken aback by the decision of this airline 
because the Department regularly communicates with all airlines to update them on how to validate South African 
passports, including the look and feel." 
The department also runs a 24-hour operations centre that airlines can access to verify South African passports. 
"It is not clear to which extent the airline has used these services before resorting to this backward profiling 
system," it said.
In response to uproar on social media, Britain's ambassador in South Africa took to Twitter to clarify that such 
language and general knowledge tests were "not a UK government requirement" for South Africans entering the 
UK. 
"Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi is at the forefront of efforts to bring an end to the abuse of South African travel 
documents," the statement said.
South Africa slams Ryanair 's Afrikaans test as "backward"
It added an unspecified number of passport fraud kingpins and their lieutenants have been arrested in recent 
months.
The Pan South African Language Board, a state organisation tasked with promoting multilingualism in the country, 
was disgusted by Ryanair's method of verifying passports through an Afrikaans test.
"We find this reckless decision by Ryanair quite problematic and is reminiscent of the old colonial and apartheid 
systematic subjugation of speakers of other languages, mainly black people, to racial and linguistic discrimination," 
the board's head Lance Schultz said in a statement.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is requiring South African passport holders to take a test in Afrikaans to 
prove their nationality, leading to accusations of racial discrimination, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
The Dublin-based budget airline is telling South African nationals they must complete a general knowledge test, 
written in Afrikaans, or they will be turned away from their flights, the newspaper said. This is despite Afrikaans 
being only the third most-spoken language in South Africa and having a history of enforced use under apartheid.
Ryanair told the FT that the questionnaire is being used "due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African 
passports".

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a substantially narrowed annual loss as revenue 
recovered, and said a return to profit was within its sights for the current year. 
For the year ended March 31, revenue for the Dublin-based budget airline jumped to EUR4.80 billion from EUR1.64 
billion the year before, as customer numbers recovered to 97.1 million from 27.5 million.
The customer levels are still 35% behind pre-Covid levels, however, Ryanair noted. 
The company narrowed its pretax loss by over half to EUR429.8 million, from EUR1.12 billion a year prior. In pre-
Covid financial 2019, pretax profit was nearing nine figures at EUR948.1 million.
The airline noted the delay in the relaxation of Covid travel curbs in the UK and EU, the impacts of Omicron and the 
Russia invasion of Ukraine all led to fares requiring "significant price stimulation". 
The average fare in the year was down 27% to EUR27. 
However, ancillary revenue helped to offset the decline, as more guests chose add-on services such as priority 
boarding and reserved seating. 
Ryanair hopes to return to a "reasonable" profit in the year. 
"This recovery, however, remains fragile," noted Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary. "Given the continuing risk 
of adverse news flows on [Ukraine and Covid restrictions], it is impractical, if not impossible, to provide a sensible or 
accurate profit guidance range at this time."
Prices still needed stimulation in the first quarter, the company said, but it is hopeful that pent-up demand will drive 
peak fares ahead of pre-Covid levels. 80% of fuel for the year is hedged, and the remaining unhedged 20% will 
likely give rise to cost increases.

Ryanair Holdings PLC - Dublin-based budget airline - Flies 14.2 million passengers in April with a load factor of 
91%, improved on both counts from 11.2 million passengers at 87% capacity in March. The company said it 
operated 82,600 flights in April. It noted that March traffic was hurt by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with 2,000 
flights to and from Ukraine cancelled that month by airspace closures. By comparison, Ryanair flew only 1.0 million 
passengers in April of last year, amid continued Covid-19 restrictions at the time. On a rolling 12-month basis, 
Ryanair has carried 110.2 million passengers at an 83% load factor, up from 28.5 million at 71% in the 12 months to 
April 2021.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday narrowed its annual forecast loss range as it reported a 
recovery in passenger numbers for March.
In March 2022, the Swords, Dublin-based airline flew 11.2 million passengers, bouncing back from just 500,000 a 
year ago. This was higher than pre-pandemic figures of 10.9 million in March 2019 and 10 million in March 2018. 
This was despite Ryanair cancelling 2,000 flights to and from Ukraine last month due to airspace closures following 
Russia's invasion.
In total, Ryanair operated over 67,800 flights in March with a load factor of 87%, up from 71% year-on-year.
Ryanair also said full-year traffic recovered strongly to over 97 million from 27.5 million in financial 2021, but 
remained below pre-Covid traffic of 149 million.  
In a newly released annual forecast, Ryanair expects a loss around EUR350 million to EUR400 million, narrowed 
from a previous guidance range of EUR250 million to EUR450 million, for its financial year ended March 31.
While the range has been trimmed, Ryanair's loss guidance at the mid-point has widened. However, this would still 
be an improvement on the net loss of EUR815 million in its previous financial year. In its pre-pandemic financial 
year 2020, Ryanair posted a profit of EUR1.00 billion.
The company will release its financial year 2022 results on May 16.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.5% at EUR13.33 in Dublin early Monday.

(Alliance News) - European budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Wednesday said 
they carried fewer passengers in January than in December, as restrictions related to the Omicron variant of Covid-
19 hit traffic. 
Ryanair carried 7.0 million passengers, down from 9.5 million in December, though up from 1.3 million in January 
2021. Load factor was 79%, down from 81% in December but up from 69% a year ago. Ryanair traffic hit a peak 
last year of 11.3 million passengers in October, but the total has declined each month since.
For Wizz Air, passengers in January totalled 2.4 million, down from 2.6 million in December but up from 2.4 million 
in November and from 573,692 a year ago. Also more positively, load factor for Wizz was 79.6% in January, up 
from 75% in December and 76% in November.
Wizz said it has continued to grow its network, with capacity in the 12 months to January increased by 57% to 31.0 
million seats from 19.7 million in the Covid-hit year-earlier rolling 12 months.
Ryanair shares were up 0.7% at EUR16.88 in Dublin early Wednesday. Wizz was up 1.0% at 4,198.00 pence in 
London.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said the rebound in flying was knocked back in the last three 
months of 2021 by the outbreak of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, as it cautioned shareholders to expect further 
disruptions from the virus pandemic.
The Dublin-based budget carrier reported a net loss of EUR96 million in the three months that ended December 31, 
its financial third quarter. This was narrowed from the third quarter of financial 2021, for which Ryanair reported a 
loss of EUR321 million. However, it was double the net loss of EUR48 million for the entire first half of the year. 
Revenue was EUR1.47 billion, multiplied year-on-year from EUR340 million. However, this was 18% down from the 
previous quarter ending September 30, which brought in revenue of EUR1.78 billion. 
Ryanair said the emergence of the Omicron variant in December had "badly damaged" bookings and yields in 
December and January, which is typically a higher-yielding period with Christmas and New Year bookings. Traffic in 
December dropped to 9.5 million, 14% below the company's expected target of 11 million, and reduced the month's 
load factor to 81%. 
The quarter had started off well in October, with strong bookings for the mid-term break, and the relaxation of the 
UK government's traffic light system of travel restrictions. October traffic was 11.2 million, with an 84% load factor. 
November followed with 10.2 million guests, at a 86% load factor, at lower fares.
The quarter overall saw the airline carry 31.1 million passengers, which was up from 8.1 million the previous year, 
when even more travel restrictions were in place. 
Ryanair said that heading into its final quarter, capacity has been cut by 33% and January's traffic target has been 
lowered to between 6 million and 7 million passengers from 10 million.  
TOP NEWS: Ryanair says Omicron cut festive flying, still hurting fares
"The outlook for pricing and yields for the remainder of FY22 is hugely uncertain," the company said. Bookings have 
improved since travel restrictions were eased, but are still "very late and close-in". This will mean the final quarter 
has needed "significant price stimulation at lower prices" to recover load factors from the drop over the festive 
period. 
Ryanair maintained its guidance for a financial 2022 net loss in a larger-than-normal range of EUR250 million to 
EUR450 million. This would good progress from a loss of EUR1.11 billion in the previous year. However, it is still far 
from pre-pandemic profit of EUR648.7 million two years ago. The airline still expects total traffic of just under 100 
million passengers for the year. 
"This outturn is hugely sensitive to any further positive or negative Covid news flow and so we would caution all 
shareholders to expect further Covid disruptions before we here in Europe and the rest of the world can finally 
declare that the Covid crisis is behind us," Ryanair warned. 
The airline's share price was down 0.4% to 16.54 pence each in Dublin on Monday morning.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has completed its delisting from the London Stock Exchange, it confirmed 
Monday.
The Dublin-based budget airline had blamed declining post-Brexit trading volumes for the move, when the decision 
was first announced last month.
In November, Ryanair explained: "As indicated at our interim results, and following subsequent shareholder 
engagement, Ryanair has decided to request the cancellation of London listing as the volume of trading of the 
shares on the London Stock Exchange does not justify the costs related to such listing and admission to trading, 
and so as to consolidate trading liquidity to one regulated market for the benefit of all shareholders."
Ryanair retains a primary listing on the Euronext Dublin market and also has American depositary shares listed on 
the Nasdaq exchange in New York.
In December of last year, Ryanair confirmed that UK shareholders will have little or no say in the running of the 
airline. Ryanair at the time said it "must take steps" to ensure that it will remain majority EU owned and controlled 
following the end of the Brexit transition period. 
With UK shareholders no longer resident in the EU, their voting rights needed to be restricted to keep within EU 
ownership rules.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it carried fewer passengers in November than in October, 
though still far more than year before, when more pandemic-related travel restrictions were in place.
Passenger traffic jumped to 10.2 million in November, after the Dublin-based low-cost airline carried just 2.0 million 
passengers a year ago. However, the figure was the lowest since July, when traffic was 9.3 million, having carried 
in excess of 11 million passengers in October. 
Ryanair operated over 62,300 flights in November with an 86% load factor, improved from 62% a year prior and 
from 84% in October.
Shares were up 0.1% at EUR14.95 in London early Thursday. 
Ryanair announced last month that it will de-list its shares from London. Trading volume has dropped due to post-
Brexit restrictions on UK share ownership. The cancellation will be effective from December 20, with the final day of 
dealing of its shares in London on December 17. 
Ryanair has a primary listing in the Euronext Dublin market and also has American depositary shares listed on the 
Nasdaq exchange in New York.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it is "considering the merits" of its London Stock Exchange 
listing following Brexit. 
Ryanair shares were 1.4% higher at EUR16.98 each in London on Monday morning. The stock has risen just over 
3.0% so far this year. 
Ryanair said trading of its in London "has reduced materially during 2021". 
"The migration away from the LSE is consistent with a general trend for trading in shares of EU corporates post-
Brexit and is, potentially, more acute for Ryanair as a result of the long-standing prohibition on non-EU citizens 
purchasing Ryanair's ordinary shares being extended to UK nationals following Brexit.
"The board of Ryanair is now considering the merits of retaining the standard listing on the LSE."
Ryanair has a primary listing in the Euronext Dublin market and also has American depositary shares listed on the 
Nasdaq. 
Also on Monday, the carrier said its traffic surged in October. It carried 11.3 million passengers last month, up 
sharply from 4.1 million a year earlier. The load factor, meanwhile, improved to 84% from 73%. 
October's figure was also improved from 10.6 million in September. 
In addition, Ryanair posted a half-year revenue hike and a narrowed loss, as the budget airline benefited from a 
rebound in passenger numbers. 
Dublin-based Ryanair painted a cautious picture for the remainder of its financial year, however, deciding against 
annual guidance as it approaches a potentially difficult winter period. 
UPDATE: Ryanair October traffic improves as weighs London delisting
In the six months to September 30, revenue rose 83% year-on-year to EUR2.15 billion from EUR1.18 billion. 
Ryanair's pretax loss narrowed to EUR99.9 million, from EUR432.3 million a year earlier. Two-years ago, the airline 
booked an interim pretax profit of EUR1.26 billion.
During the period, it carried 39.1 million customers, more than doubled yearly from 17.1 million. The load factor 
improved to 79% from 72% a year prior. 
"Following a very badly disrupted Q1, which saw most Easter flights cancelled and a slower-than-expected easing 
of EU government travel restrictions in May and June, traffic rebounded in Q2 with the successful rollout of the EU 
Digital Covid Certificates in July," the company said. 
Most flight bookings are "close-in", however, meaning they were made closer to departure time. Ryanair also 
charged that in the UK, consumer confidence was hit by the "confusing and inconsistent traffic light system", which 
has since been phased out. 
UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on Thursday last week announced all remaining countries in England's red 
travel list will be removed with effect on Monday. This means arrivals will no longer need to spend 11 nights in a 
quarantine hotel at a cost of GBP2,285.
Ryanair added on Monday: "In recent weeks, we have seen a surge in bookings for the October mid-term and 
Christmas breaks, and we expect this peak buoyancy to continue into Easter and summer 2022."
However, Ryanair said its outlook for "pricing and yields" will be "challenging" in winter. 
"With the booking curve remaining very close-in, traffic recovery will require continuing price stimulation. This, 
coupled with rising costs for the small unhedged balance of our fuel needs, means that visibility for the remainder of 
FY22 is very limited," the carrier explained.
Ryanair decided against offering "meaningful" annual guidance. It does, however, expect a net loss of between 
EUR100 million and EUR200 million. Its net loss in the first half narrowed to EUR47.6 million from EUR410.5 million 
a year earlier. 
Ryanair added: "This outturn will be crucially dependent on the continued rollout of vaccines and no adverse Covid-
19 developments."
For financial 2021, it made a net loss of EUR1.02 billion.

On The Beach reports strong position despite 'suppressed trading'
On The Beach reports strong position despite 'suppressed trading'

(Alliance News) - On The Beach Group PLC on Wednesday reported "suppressed trading" in the second half of its 
financial year, but the holiday retailer maintained that it remains in a strong position as it heads into the typically 
busiest booking period for travel.
During the six months that ended September 30, On The Beach said it had experienced difficult trading but 
remained well-placed to take advantage of market opportunities when demand for booking holidays returns. While 
demand for international leisure travel currently remains below pre-pandemic levels, the company highlighted that 
its specific initiatives, including its 'free Covid tests' promotion, combined with a further softening of government 
restrictions, have stimulated bookings in the final weeks of the financial year. 
Going forward, On The Beach said it remains committed to investing for long-term market share gains in its current 
financial year, ahead of full market recovery. 
"The strategic initiatives we have taken throughout the year to best navigate the crisis and manage risk while 
investing in our brand, people and technology, ensure On the Beach is in a strong position as we head into our 
typically busiest booking period," said Chief Executive Simon Cooper.
On The Beach restarted selling holidays to travel from early September 2021, when it became clearer that overall 
confidence to book holidays had increased.
Last Friday, the Financial Times reported that legal documents filed with the High Court showed On the Beach was 
suing Ryanair Holdings PLC for blocking the travel agent from booking flights with the Irish low-cost carrier. On the 
Beach also claimed that Ryanair had abused its "dominant" position in the market and made "false and disparaging 
claims".
On The Beach made no comment on the report in its trading statement on Wednesday.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Monday reported improvement in 
passenger numbers in September, ahead of UK travel rules being relaxed, offering a rosier outlook for the carriers. 
Ryanair saw traffic more than double to 10.6 million in September from 5.2 million a year ago, while load factor 
improved to 81% from 71%. September's figure slipped from August's 11.1 million passengers, however, but was 
up on July's 9.3 million. 
Wizz Air, meanwhile, flew 3.0 million passengers in September, up 91% on a year ago, with an improved load factor 
of 78.4% versus 64.6%.
"Wizz Air announced new routes from Debrecen [in Hungary] to Brussels-Charleroi [Belgium], Belgium and Kyiv-
Zhulyany, Ukraine. New routes will be operated twice a week from the middle of December 2021. In addition, Wizz 
Air announced the restart of three routes from Debrecen to Tel-Aviv, Moscow, and Santorini. Together with new 
services, Wizz Air now offers 10 routes from Hungary's second largest city," Wizz added. 
The updates from the two budget airlines come the same day as the UK's traffic light travel system involving green, 
amber and red lists were scrapped to make travel "easier and cheaper".
Locations are now categorised as either on the red list or not - and there are UK press reports that the number of 
countries on the red list will be slashed to nine from 54 later in the week, with destinations such as Brazil, Mexico 
and South Africa expected to be opened up to quarantine-free travel.
Fully vaccinated residents – and unvaccinated under 18s – from more than 50 countries and territories can now 
enter the UK without needing to complete a pre-departure lateral flow test, take a day-eight post-arrival PCR test 
costing around GBP65, or self-isolate at home, with just a single day-two post-arrival test needed.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair and Wizz post passenger hikes before new UK rules
People arriving from a red tier destination will still be required to spend 11 nights at a quarantine hotel, costing 
GBP2,285 for solo travellers.
Shares in Ryanair were 2.4% higher EUR17.64 each in London on Monday morning, while Wizz Air shares were 
marginally higher at 5,216.00 pence. Elsewhere in the travel sector, British Airways-parent International 
Consolidated Airlines Group SA was 1.5% higher at 190.92p, while easyJet PLC was 0.3% higher at 705.80p.

Esken confirms no passenger flights from Southend Airport over winter
Esken confirms no passenger flights from Southend Airport over winter

(Alliance News) - Esken Ltd on Thursday said it has delayed the restart of commercial passenger services from 
London Southend Airport to Spring 2022 as it looks to save cash.
The Isle of Man-based company, formerly known as Stobart Group, has two core assets: Southend Airport and 
biomass fuel provider Stobart Energy.
Shares were down 1.2% to 14.68 pence in London on Thursday midday. 
The only passenger airline operating at Southend is Ryanair Holdings PLC, which announced last month it would 
end its limited service on November 1. It was the latest blow for the airport, after easyJet PLC pulled out last year. 
Wizz Air Holdings PLC operates one route to and from Southend, but it's currently suspended. 
Esken said last month that it was in talks with a range of airlines, targeting a return of passenger flights ahead of the 
peak summer season in 2022. 
On Wednesday, Esken confirmed the suspension of passenger services, saying "the decision taken alongside our 
airline partners to delay the restart of commercial passenger operations to Spring 2022 will further allow [Southend] 
to minimise operating expenditure and maintain tight cost control," as demand continues to be hit by the pandemic. 
Talks with airlines over a return to passenger services are ongoing and management is confident, Esken added.
Southend still has GBP19.7 million cash ring-fenced after a deal with Carlyle Group, in which the private equity firm 
could eventually get a 30% stake in the airport. 
The lack of income from passenger services was partially offset by cargo flights, Esken added. 
Meanwhile, Esken's energy business is trading in line with expectations and returned to pre-Covid levels of 
profitability and cash generation in the first half of the 2022 financial year, which ends February 28.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC boss Michael O'Leary has warned that prices will increase as passengers 
rush to holiday in Europe next summer.
O'Leary said this huge demand for holidays would coincide with fewer flights, meaning a price rise for flights and 
also for hotels.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, he said: "I think there will be a dramatic recovery in holiday tourism within 
Europe next year. And the reason why I think prices will be dramatically higher is that there's less capacity.
"Take out Thomas Cook, Flybe, Norwegian – Alitalia's reducing its fleet by 40%. There is going to be about 20% 
less short-haul capacity in Europe in 2022 with a dramatic recovery in demand."
Ryanair prices will be cut this winter, to "grab market share everywhere", O'Leary said.

(Alliance News) - Both Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC saw an uptick in passenger numbers in 
August as the travel sector benefits from Europe's vaccination progress. 
Irish budget airline Ryanair on Thursday reported August traffic of 11.1 million at a load factor of 82%, operating 
over 71,000 flights in the month. 
August's stats marked an improvement on July, when it flew 9.3 million passengers at a load factor of 80%. In 
August 2020, Ryanair saw 7.0 million passengers and registered a load factor of 73%.
Ryanair noted that the EU's Covid certificates have helped to stimulate air travel recovery.
Central and eastern Europe-focused airline Wizz Air, meanwhile, said it carried 3.6 million passengers at a load 
factor of 83.6% in August. The traffic figure was up 50% on a year ago, while load factor notched a 12.7 percentage 
point improvement on 2020.
Ryanair shares were trading 0.3% higher in London on Thursday at EUR16.04 each, while Wizz Air stock was up 
1.1% at 4,988.00 pence a share.

(Alliance News) - Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair returned to profit in July thanks to a strong holiday season, but 
expects a "difficult" winter, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told AFP on Tuesday.
"We went back to profit in July, we'll make a profit again in August because the recovery has been very strong in 
the peak summer period. But this winter will be difficult," O'Leary said after holding a major press conference in 
London.
Shares in the Dublin-based airline were down 3.1% to EUR15.84 in London on Tuesday afternoon. 
Earlier, O'Leary told Reuters that Ryanair has lifted its passenger target for September, October and November to 
10.5 million per month. The previous forecast in July was for 10 million passengers per month in that period. 
O'Leary said Ryanair is set to beat its target for 10.5 million passengers in August, and that capacity should return 
to pre-pandemic levels in October - up from 90% in September and 80% in August.
But around 15% to 20% of seats will be empty over the winter, compared to 7% to 8% before the pandemic, he 
added. Pricing will "continue to build" over the winter and is expected to reach pre-Covid levels in summer 2022.

Esken seeks new carrier as Ryanair prepares to depart London Southend

(Alliance News) - Esken Ltd on Monday said it was in talks with replacement carriers as it seeks to compensate for 
the decision of Ryanair Holdings PLC plans to close its base at London Southend Airport.
Shares in Esken were trading down 2.7% at 15.92 pence each in London on Monday morning. Ryanair was down 
0.3% at EUR16.63.
Esken, formerly known as Stobart Group, is an infrastructure, aviation and energy company with operations in the 
UK and Ireland. It owns and operates London Southend.
Last Friday, Ryanair announced plans to close its base there on November 1. The low-cost carrier decided to 
redeploy the two aircraft currently located at London Southend to other bases, after the pandemic significantly 
affected the Dublin-based company's load factors and yields.
Esken said it expects Ryanair's decision to have a "negligible" effect on its current financial year, given expectations 
of limited flying in the upcoming winter season.
Management has time to initiate cost savings and deferral of discretionary capital expenditure ahead of the 
following period, financial 2023, the company said. 
Esken said it also plans to attract new carriers to the airport to replace Ryanair.
"The group is in active dialogue with a range of low cost and flagship carriers where the previously proven route 
profitability, the airport's efficient operating cost base and the safe passenger experience is likely to prove attractive 
as demand recovers," the company said. 
If the company takes no mitigating actions, it said Ryanair's departure would result in a hit of up to GBP1.4 million 
to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and to cash headroom in financial 2023.
Esken seeks new carrier as Ryanair prepares to depart London Southend
The ring-fenced funding facility for the airport has adequate headroom to cover any such potential impact, Esken 
noted. Early last month, Esken secured GBP125 million in financing for Southend Airport from private equity 
investor Carlyle Group. 
"Esken remains focussed on targeting airlines for the recovery of flying in summer [2022] when demand is expected 
to show a recovery post Covid-19," the company said.
Executive Chair David Shearer added: "The fundamental commercial rationale for [London Southend Airport] 
remains strong and our partnership announced recently with Carlyle will allow us to capitalise on that opportunity as 
passenger demand recovers."

Esken Ltd - London Southend airport operator - Notes Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC has stated its intention to 
close its base at London Southend Airport with effect from the start of the winter season this year. As a result, 
Ryanair will cease operations based from London Southend Airport from November 1.
"Esken is currently in the process of reviewing the impact of such decision on its forecasts. However, the financial 
impact of Ryanair's base closure will be mitigated by a reduction in costs directly associated with serving Ryanair's 
base and the low level of passengers expected during the winter season," it says.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said passenger numbers more than doubled in July 
following the roll-out of EU Covid certificates.
The budget airline carried 9.3 million passengers, up from 4.4 million a year ago. Compared to June, passenger 
numbers increased by 75% from 5.3 million. 
The load factor, measuring how many seats on planes are filled, was 80% in July. That's up from the 72% achieved 
in both June and in July 2020. 
The Dublin-based carrier cited the EU Covid certificate scheme, which was rolled out on July 1. This allows those 
who have either been vaccinated, tested negative, or recovered from the disease to travel within the bloc. 
On Tuesday, smaller rival Wizz Air Holdings PLC said July passenger numbers increased 62% year-on-year and 
90% month-on-month, with a load factor of 79%. 
Ryanair shares were down 0.1% at EUR16.64 in London on Wednesday morning.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said at best it expects to achieve a breakeven in its current 
financial year, as it saw signs of recovery in the first quarter on easing lockdown restrictions in the EU and the UK. 
The Irish budget airline said traffic rebounded to 8.1 million in the three months to June 30 from 500,000 a year 
before, as capacity recovered in May and June. As a result, revenue nearly tripled in the quarter to EUR370.5 
million from EUR125.2 million a year earlier. 
Scheduled revenue grew by 91% year-on-year to EUR192 million, while ancillary revenue - generated from goods 
or services not including tickets - performed well, generating EUR22 per passenger, as more guests choose priority 
boarding and reserved seating.  
Ryanair said it saw operating costs more than doubling to EUR675 million in the first quarter from EUR312.8 million, 
driven primarily by variable costs such as fuel, airport & handling and route charges.
The company's pretax loss widened to EUR324.5 million from EUR210.0 million year-on-year. 
Going forward, the company said its current financial year is expected to be challenging, with Covid-19 travel 
restrictions prolonging uncertainty. Following the July 1 rollout of EU Digital Covid Certificate and the relaxation of 
the UK's quarantine rules for those who are fully-vaccinated, the company said it has seen second-quarter bookings 
recover strongly, albeit at low fares.
Ryanair said it believes that full-year traffic has improved to a range of 90 million to 100 million from the previously 
guided 80 million to 120 million passenger range, and the company said it expects that the likely outcome for the 
year to the end of March 2022 is "somewhere between a small loss and breakeven".

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday set out a plan to recruit 2,000 new pilots over the next three 
years for new aircraft deliveries to recover from the damage done from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Captain vacancies created by these new aircraft deliveries are expected to be filled by internal promotions, which 
will allow for replacement First Officers and new cadet pilots.
Ryanair has now taken delivery of its first Boeing 737-8200 Gamechanger aircraft, which is expected to help the 
Swords-based low cost airline reduce costs, cut fuel consumption and lower noise and CO2 emissions. 
"Ryanair has worked closely with our people to save jobs and we are delighted to start planning for a return to 
growth over the coming years as we recover from the Covid-19 crisis and grow to 200 million guests by FY2024," 
said People Director Darrell Hughes.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.1% at EUR16.05 in London on Monday afternoon.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Friday both reported sharp jumps in 
passenger numbers in June, as vaccine programmes and easing restrictions increase confidence among travellers 
at the start of the crucial summer season.
Dublin-based Ryanair carried 5.3 million passengers in June, up from 400,000 in the same month last year. It was a 
sharp increase from May, which saw 1.8 million passengers, and April, with 1.0 million. 
It means Ryanair carried 8.1 million passengers in the first quarter of its financial year ending March 2022, up from 
510,000 in the same period last year. 
Wizz Air also reported a jump in passengers, although not as dramatic as for Ryanair. A total of 1.6 million booked 
passengers flew with Wizz Air in June, up from 502,253 in June 2020 and 832,538 in May 2021. 
But load factors for both airlines remained stubbornly low. Ryanair filled 72% of seats on its flights in June, down 
from 79% in May. Load factors have been around the 70% to 80% range throughout the pandemic, despite massive 
cuts to capacity, down from 97% in previous peak seasons. 
Wizz Air filled 64% of its seats in June, down from 66% the previous month. 
Last month, Ryanair added seats to destinations such as Malta and the Balearic Islands following their addition to 
the UK's travel green list, but urged the government to relax travel rules further. It criticised the current traffic light 
system for UK travellers as being "very confusing" for airlines and customers.
Both airlines also operate routes within the EU, where passengers face fewer restrictions. 
Wizz Air said it opened its sixth Italian base, in Naples, last month.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday reported a significant increase in passenger numbers for 
May compared to a virus-depressed May 2020, on the continued easing of global travel restrictions and the 
increased rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Europe.
For the month, the Swords, Ireland-based budget airline said it flew 1.8 million passengers in May, up from 1.0 
million in April and from just 70,000 a year ago. It said it operated 12,000 flights during May with a 79% load factor. 
On a rolling annual basis however, Ryanair flew 30.2 million passengers, down 75% from 121.1 million a year 
before.
On Saturday, the Irish government said it would broadly implement the EU's digital Covid certificate from July 19, 
facilitating travel between EU member states, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
The digital Covid certificate will facilitate free movement in the EU for people who have been vaccinated or can 
provide a negative PCR test taken 72 hours prior to arrival. However, restrictions will remain in place for Great 
Britain and the US.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were up 0.2% at EUR17.15 on Wednesday in London.

Russia to support Belarus with USD500 million in credit

(Alliance News) - Russia is to support Belarus with USD500 million in credit over the coming weeks, the leaders of 
the two countries have agreed.
During a meeting, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko agreed the 
sum would be paid out by the end of June, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Saturday, according to 
news agency Interfax.
This is the second tranche of a credit package that was agreed before the controversial forced landing of a 
passenger aeroplane in Minsk last Sunday in order to arrest a dissident blogger, Roman Protasevich, and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
During their meeting in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, Putin and Lukashenko spoke about trade and economic 
cooperation, Peskov said.
Belarus' economy is weak, and it has already borrowed billions of dollars from Moscow.
During the opening of the meeting on Friday, both leaders complained about pressure from Western countries on 
Belarus.
After the incident with the plane - a Ryanair commercial flight between the two EU capitals of Athens and Vilnius 
that was forced to reroute and land in Minsk - the EU and the US imposed fresh sanctions on Belarus, which the 
Kremlin slammed as an emotional reaction.
Peskov emphasized that the fate of Sapega, who is a Russian national, mattered to the Russian authorities, but 
said the 23-year-old had a residency permit in Belarus.
Meanwhile the president of the EU Parliament, David Sassoli, said he wants to keep up pressure Belarus in order 
secure the release of the blogger and his girlfriend.

Sassoli suggested that photos of Protassevich be exhibited at all airports in the EU and in the European Parliament.
"We will keep the attention and the pressure up and hope that this will lead to the release of Roman Protasevich 
and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega," he said in remarks to Germany's Funke media group.
Sassoli called the EU's initial reaction to the forced landing of a passenger jet in Minsk as "strong and unified."

US targets Belarus with sanctions amid Western outcry over plane
US targets Belarus with sanctions amid Western outcry over plane

(Alliance News) - The US on Friday announced punitive measures against Belarus targeting the regime of 
strongman President Alexander Lukashenko, who met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin amid a global outcry over 
the forced diversion of a European plane.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki called for "a credible international investigation into the events of May 23," 
which she called "a direct affront to international norms."
Belarus scrambled a military jet to divert a Ryanair plane and arrested 26-year-old opposition journalist and activist 
Roman Protasevich who was onboard, triggering a global outcry.
The White House announced it was working with the EU on a list of targeted sanctions against key members of 
Lukashenko's regime.
Meanwhile, economic sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises, reimposed by Washington in April 
following a crackdown on pro-democracy protests, will come into effect on June 3.
Further US moves on Belarus could target "those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and attacks 
on democracy," Psaki said.
The White House also issued a "Do Not Travel" warning for Belarus to US citizens, and warned American 
passenger planes to "exercise extreme caution" if considering flying over Belarusian airspace.
The EU has also urged EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace.
However President Vladimir Putin celebrated Russia's close ties with Belarus on Friday as he hosted Lukashenko 
in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
US targets Belarus with sanctions amid Western outcry over plane
With observers closely watching the talks to see how far the Kremlin would go to support the regime, the Russian 
leader said he was "very glad" to see Lukashenko and agreed with him the Western reaction was an "outburst of 
emotion".
Lukashenko complained the West was seeking to stir unrest in Belarus.
"An attempt is underway to rock the boat to reach the level of last August," he said, referring to anti-regime protests 
following a disputed election.
"It's clear what these Western friends want from us."
The Belarus strongman, who arrived with a briefcase, said he wanted to show Putin "some documents" related to 
the Ryanair incident and thanked him for his support in the latest standoff with the West.
The talks lasted for more than five hours but their results were not announced.
Over the past years Lukashenko has had a volatile relationship with Moscow, playing it off against the West and 
ruling out outright unification with Russia.
But after the Ryanair plane incident his options appear to be limited.
Putin and the Belarus leader have met regularly since August, when historic protests broke out against 
Lukashenko's nearly three-decade rule.
The 66-year-old waged a ruthless crackdown on his opponents and has leaned increasingly on the Russian 
president amid condemnation from the West.
Several people died during the unrest in Belarus, thousands were detained, and hundreds reported torture in 
prison.
Sunday's plane diversion was a dramatic escalation, with EU leaders accusing Minsk of essentially hijacking a 
European flight to arrest Protasevich.
The overflight ban has led to several cancellations of air journeys between Russia and Europe, after Russian 
authorities rejected plans that would have skipped Belarusian airspace.
Russia insists the cancellations are purely "technical", but they have raised concerns that Moscow could be 
systematically refusing to let European airlines land if they avoid Belarus.
The Kremlin criticized the flight ban as politically motivated and dangerous, with foreign ministry spokeswoman 
Maria Zakharova calling it "completely irresponsible".
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc was monitoring whether this was a broader policy from Russia, 
but Moscow insisted the disruptions were in no way political.
Belarus authorities claimed to have received a bomb threat against the Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius carrying 
the dissident.
Minsk said it demanded the flight land in the Belarus capital based on the message it said was sent from a 
ProtonMail address by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
Protasevich, who helped organize the demonstrations against Lukashenko's rule last year, was arrested along with 
Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, after the plane landed in the city.
Borrell has said proposals are "on the table" to target key sectors of the Belarusian economy including its oil 
products and potash sectors.
US targets Belarus with sanctions amid Western outcry over plane
Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Friday urged the EU to be "braver" and impose more 
sanctions against the Minsk regime.
After meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague, Tikhanovskaya said measures being discussed by 
EU countries did not go far enough.
EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Friday warned Lukashenko that "it is time to change course." 
"No amount of repression, brutality or coercion will bring any legitimacy to your authoritarian regime," she said.
The European Commission president also wrote to the opposition offering a three-billion-euro package to support "a 
democratic Belarus" if Lukashenko steps down.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC's boss has accused the Irish government of bringing "untold damage" on 
the aviation and tourism sector.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary also criticised Transport Minister Eamon Ryan for having no "plan, policy or 
commitment" on aviation.
The airline boss made the comments after he called on the government to announce an "immediate rescue plan" 
for Irish aviation and tourism.
On Friday, the government is to confirm its plan to ease more restrictions in June and July.
Taoiseach Micheal Martin will announce details on the full reopening of the hospitality sector, international travel 
and sports and cultural events.
O'Leary called for Martin to restore the UK Common Travel Area on June 1, describing it as "bizarre and untenable" 
that UK visitors arriving into the Republic have to undergo quarantine.
He also said that passengers travelling between Ireland and other EU member states should not be subject to hotel 
quarantine or coronavirus restrictions.
O'Leary also referenced the number of people who have received Covid-19 vaccines in Ireland and the low number 
of patients with the virus in hospital.
He also accused the National Public Health Emergency Team of "promulgating scare stories" about the variant 
predominantly found in India.
"This government has visited untold damage on Irish aviation and tourism," O'Leary said in a statement.
"Ireland has a Minister for Transport who has no plan, no policy and no commitment to aviation.
Ryanair chief accuses Irish government of doing damage to aviation
"Ireland is an island on the periphery of Europe, yet our transport minister has sat on an aviation recovery plan 
since July 2020, but taken no action at all.
"Ryanair has no faith in Minister Eamonn Ryan, who has shown himself to be ineffective and not up to the job, even 
while Irish airlines are closing bases here, and moving aircraft and jobs overseas to the UK and Europe.
"It is time for Micheal Martin's government to introduce an emergency rescue plan for Irish aviation and tourism.
"Staycations may fill some hotels in the south and west of Ireland during July and August, but it will not fill the hotels 
of Dublin, and nor will it support Irish tourism once the schools reopen in September.
"Since our minister for transport is incapable or unwilling to act, Micheal Martin and Leo Varadkar must now take 
charge and reopen Ireland from the UK from Tuesday and to and from the EU from July 1."
A spokesperson for Minister Ryan said he makes "no apologies for the public health measures approved by the 
cabinet to protect the Irish public during the pandemic."
They added: "He also appreciates the frustration of those who work in the aviation and related sectors.
"As Ryanair is well aware, Minister Ryan has been a firm advocate of a safe and planned return to international 
travel.
"Ryanair is also well aware that the government will take a decision tomorrow in this regard, and that the 
government has committed to the implementation of the EU Digital Covid Certificate and other measures to ease 
restrictions.
"In addition Ryanair has benefited from extensive supports from the Irish government to the aviation sector, which 
means the Irish taxpayer, throughout the pandemic."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a loss in its most recently ended financial year but it 
expects an improvement as coronavirus restrictions ease. 
The Irish budget airline said it swung to a loss for the year to the end of March of EUR1.11 billion from EUR648.7 
million profit recorded the year before. 
Annual revenue fell 81% year-on-year to EUR1.64 billion from EUR8.49 billion, in line with the fall in traffic to just 
27.5 million from 148.6 million the year prior. Load factor declined to 71% from 95% year-on-year. 
Ancillary revenue delivered a solid performance as more guests chose priority boarding and reserved seating, 
resulting in an 11% increase in per passenger spend to almost EUR22. Ancillary revenue is generated from non-
ticket sources, such as baggage fees and on-board food and services. 
Due to an 81% reduction in traffic and aircraft delivery delays, the company said it recorded a EUR200 million 
ineffectiveness charge on fuel and currency hedges in its most recently ended financial year.
Going forward, Ryanair said its current financial year continues to be challenging, with uncertainty around when and 
where Covid lockdowns and travel restrictions will be eased. 
Looking ahead, the company said it expects first-quarter traffic to be between 5 million and 6 million guests. It also 
believes that annual traffic is likely to be towards the lower end of its previously guided range of 80 million to 120 
million passengers, which would represent a jump of up to four times year-on-year.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Wednesday reported a significant increase 
in passenger numbers for April from a year before, as global travel restrictions  in place for a year now show start to 
be eased.
Irish budget airline Ryanair posted 1.0 million passengers for April, a sharp rise from a mere 40,000 in the same 
month a year before. The group said it had operated over 8,000 flights with a 67% load factor last month, as the 
pandemic continues to damp air traffic.
Ryanair's rolling 12-month total was 28.5 million at a 71% load factor. The passenger total was down 79% from 
135.1 million in the prior 12 months.
Wizz Air, meanwhile, reported 564,634 passengers in April, up significantly from 78,382 in April 2020. This was at a 
load factor of 59.2%, down 15.1 percentage points from 74.3% a year before.
During the month, the Central and Eastern Europe-focused airline operated at 22% of its capacity.
Wizz Air's rolling 12-month passenger total was 10.7 million, a 71% drop from 36.8 million the 12 months before, 
while the load factor declined 30.0 percentage points to 63.6% from 93.6%.
On Tuesday, the European Commission proposed to ease restrictions on travel to countries in the bloc amid 
progressing Covid-19 vaccination campaigns and lower infection rates.
And the UK government's "green list" of countries to which people can travel without having to isolate for 14 days 
on their return is expected to be released this week. Reports suggested the list could include about a dozen 
countries, although some newspapers suggest it could be fewer than 10.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday lost further legal challenges to state rescues of rival airlines 
as an EU court cleared pandemic aid to SAS and Finnair.
The cases were part of a legal campaign across Europe by the Irish low-cost airline to stop bailout deals for the 
bloc's legacy airlines.
In the case of Finland's biggest carrier, loan guarantees were "necessary in order to remedy the serious 
disturbance in the Finnish economy in view of the importance of Finnair for that economy," a court statement said.
In a separate decision, the court said state aid given to airline SAS by Sweden and Denmark was legal "given that 
SAS has the largest market share in Denmark and Sweden" with no close rival.
Ryanair has long railed against the support given to national champions, and is often backed by the European 
Commission which requests that companies make concessions – such as giving up valuable flight slots in busy 
airports – in return for state aid. 
But state aid rules have been considerably weakened to fight the pandemic and Ryaniar has now lost four cases at 
EU courts.
Ryanair – Europe's biggest airline in terms of passenger numbers – is also seeking to undo Germany's massive 
bailout of Deutsche Lufthansa AG in the EU courts as well as schemes in Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal.
Ryanair has estimated the total state aid to airlines approved by Brussels since the beginning of the pandemic at 
EUR30 billion, including EUR11 billion to Lufthansa, EUR10.6 billion to Air France-KLM SA, EUR3.5 billion to 
Alitalia and EUR1.3 billion to SAS.
Ryanair loses challenges in EU court over rivals' bailouts
Based in Ireland but hugely popular in the UK, Ryanair was able to get a GBP600 million  emergency loan from 
British public authorities in May last year.
Shares in Ryanair were up 1.9% at EUR15.98 in London on Wednesday.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday trimmed its annual loss estimate but warned traffic in its 
current financial year will be at the lower end of the carrier's guidance range. 
For the year ended March 31, financial 2021, Ryanair expects to post a net loss, before exceptional items, between 
EUR800 million and EUR850 million. The airline company's previous forecast was for a loss between EUR850 
million and EUR950 million. 
Despite the forecast being slightly improved, it is still a wild swing from the EUR1.00 billion of pre-exceptional, post-
tax profit Ryanair made in financial 2020. 
What's more, the company cautioned on traffic for financial 2022. 
"FY22 traffic is likely to be towards the lower end of our previously guided range of 80 million to 120 million 
passengers," the company warned.
Ryanair said it was hurt by Easter travel curbs and the EU's slow Covid-19 vaccine rollout. And on earnings for the 
current financial year, the company was also slightly pessimistic. 
"While it is not possible (at this time) to provide meaningful FY22 profit guidance, we do not share the recent 
optimism of certain analysts as we believe that the outcome for FY22 is currently close to breakeven," Ryaniar 
explained. 
Ryanair reports on its financial 2021 results on May 17.
On Tuesday, Ryanair reported a slump in passenger numbers for March. It saw just 500,000 passengers in March, 
down 91% from 5.5 million a year ago. The firm said it operated just 5% of its normal March schedule with a 77% 
load factor.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday reported slumps in passenger numbers for 
March.
Budget airline Ryanair reported 500,000 passengers for March, down 91% on 5.5 million a year ago. The firm said it 
operated just 5% of its normal March schedule with a 77% load factor. 
Wizz Air, meanwhile, reported 480,203 passengers in March, down 73% on a year ago, when it carried 1.8 million. 
This was at a load factor of 62.5%, down 29.4 percentage points from 92.0%. Wizz said it operated just below 20% 
of its capacity last month.
Year-on-year comparisons for both airlines should get easier from here following the anniversary of the first virus 
lockdowns in Europe in late March last year.
On Monday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country must be "realistic" over the resumption of foreign 
holidays due to "a surge" of coronavirus in popular destinations.
A global travel taskforce review warned "the state of the pandemic abroad, and the progress of vaccination 
programmes in other countries" meant it was impossible to say yet whether foreign holidays would be allowed from 
May 17, the date earmarked as the earliest possible for the resumption of international trips.
It confirmed the government is examining a traffic-light system for countries, with travel to green list nations 
requiring no quarantine on return to the UK – although tests will still be required – although it is too early to say 
which destinations will be in that category.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.3% at EUR16.57 in London on Tuesday, while Wizz Air was up 0.6% at 5,004.00 
pence.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC vowed on Wednesday to return to a near-normal summer schedule this 
year by flying 2,300 flights a week from Britain to Europe.
The Irish discount airline said it will be running the flights across 480 routes and is also launching 26 new routes, 
including from London to the Greek islands of Santorini and Zakynthos, this summer.
The schedule means that Ryanair would be running at about 80% of its usual capacity.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said that, because of the government's successful vaccine roll-out, Britain is "on 
track" for a reopening of European short-haul flights.
He also said passengers may be asked to wear face masks on Ryanair flights until 2022.
"I would imagine at this point in time, we're planning to continue to require mandatory face mask-wearing on board 
our aircraft through the remainder of this summer schedule and next winter's schedule," he said.
But while Britons may be keen to book a summer getaway, the British prime minister has been more cautious.
Boris Johnson has repeatedly been cagey regarding whether or not people should book overseas holidays, stating 
it is "too early" to tell.
In a briefing to journalists on Tuesday, he said "things certainly look difficult for the time being" and added that more 
detail would be revealed on April 5 - the next review date of whether England can lift restrictions as planned.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday announced that it has received approval to extend its 
unsecured GBP600 million funding under Her Majesty's Treasury and the Bank of England's UK Covid Corporate 
Financing Facility for another 12 months.
The Irish low cost airline said the funds would be redrawn in the coming days, and used for general corporate 
purposes.
On Wednesday last week, Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said at the Transport Select Committee that the 
furlough scheme was "welcome", but "the government has been lamentable in providing other support".
"The furlough scheme falls short of what needs to be done and it will be a very challenging and difficult return to 
normal operation or pre-Covid operation levels and profitability."
In documents accompanying UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak's government budget, it was revealed 
that Air Passenger Duty rates for departures from Britain will increase by GBP2 to GBP82 for travellers with 
economy tickets, and by GBP5 to GBP181 for those in premium cabins.
Ryanair said its balance sheet remains "one of the strongest in the industry", and expects to have over EUR3 billion 
in cash by the end of March.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were down 0.8% at EUR16.80 on Wednesday in London.

total was 32.7 million, down 79% from 153.8 million a year previous.
The Dublin-based carrier said it ran just 6% of its normal February schedule with a 78% load factor. Its rolling 12-
month load factor was 74%.

Budapest-based, central and eastern Europe-focused Wizz Air in February flew 17% of the capacity it had a year 
before, with a 70% load factor, down from 94% in February 2020.
Ryanair shares were down 3.1% at EUR16.41 in London on Tuesday morning. Wizz Air was down 0.4% at

(Alliance News) - Staff at Ryanair Holdings PLC who were tested for Covid-19 have raised concerns over the 
manner in which an outbreak of the virus at the airline's headquarters was handled.
Internal communications obtained by the PA news agency informed staff of an outbreak in the office at Airside 
Business Park in Swords, North Dublin on December 9.
The HSE intervened and initiated mass testing at the office.
At least one staff member who was being tested was instructed by a line manager to tell the HSE they had no close 
contacts in the office in the event of a positive result.
They were advised that names of individuals could not be provided to the HSE "due to GDPR purposes".
The employee was told to advise the HSE they had no close contacts in the office based on "all procedures being 
followed".
If the HSE persisted with questions, the employee was directed to refer them to a senior member of staff at the 
airline.
The revelations come just a week after Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary accused public health chiefs in Ireland of 
causing "mass hysteria".
Prior to the HSE's involvement, the company was operating its own testing regime for staff.
One employee said they believed the HSE became involved after noticing a high number of employees presenting 
with symptoms.
The PA news agency has been told that a number of staff in the operations room at Ryanair HQ were particularly 
concerned about safety procedures in place in the building.
Ryanair Staff Concerned Over Handling Of Covid At Dublin Headquarters
A staff member said: "That room in particular, it's like a meeting room. It's big, but there's no ventilation, the doors 
are always closed.
"Even the winter before Covid, one person in the room got sick and we all got sick. The ventilation in the room is 
shocking."
They said colleagues had been "freaked out" by the number of positive cases.
A staff memo sent in mid-December advised staff that "the majority of people in the Ops area" had tested negative.
But sources believe the extent of the number of cases was played down to workers in the building, based on the 
length of time testing continued.
Staff were first notified of an outbreak on December 9, internal communications obtained by the PA News Agency 
show.
It said the outbreak had been confined to a single room and that all HSE advice was followed, including a deep 
clean of the office, and testing of staff was arranged for the following day.
Staff were informed of a "small number" of additional cases in a memo sent on December 16.
On January 28, a memo informed staff there had been no positive case for over a week.
The revelations come just a week after Ryanair boss Micheal O'Leary launched an attack public health chiefs, 
accusing them of causing "mass hysteria" over the coronavirus.
In an interview with RTE last Monday, O'Leary insisted his airline would bounce back by June, encouraging people 
to resume international travel.
He said: "Nphet and the chief medical officer, if he was doing his job properly, should be holding press conferences 
announcing the number of people who have been vaccinated.
"Not issuing scare stories about numbers of people in hospitals."
He added: "We need to get away from the mass hysteria created by Nphet."
A Ryanair spokesperson said the airline does not comment "on rumour or speculation".
They added: "Ryanair operates an essential service, and has at all times complied with HSE Health and Safety 
guidelines in the workplace."
A spokesperson for the HSE said: "The HSE does not comment on individual cases or outbreaks as to do so would 
breach our duty of confidentiality to the individuals or businesses concerned."
However, they said where there are cases identified at a workplace, the local public health team "discuss this with 
the case, asks them about their contacts and also discuss the issue with the facility."
The spokesperson added: "Initially, if there are only one or two cases, only the cases and their contacts are tested 
and advised to stay off work and to isolate.
"However, depending on the local circumstances –environment, work practices, travel arrangements, 
accommodation and social practices – different approaches will be taken on whether to test all staff, some staff 
considered at slightly higher risk, none immediately, or to wait for the first set of contact results.
"Likewise, whether to close or keep open the facility will be dependent on all the above factors. This approach is 
used in a wide range of settings."

UK Advertising Regulator Bans Ryanair 's "Jab And Go" Covid Advert

(Alliance News) - Britain's advertising watchdog on Wednesday banned an "irresponsible" advert by Irish no-frills 
airline Ryanair Holdings PLC that urged customers to get a Covid vaccine and fly, using the hook "jab and go".
The television advert, which Ryanair rolled out alongside the recent start of Britain's vaccination programme, 
encouraged viewers to get inoculated before booking flights for upcoming holiday seasons.
The Advertising Standards Authority, which received 2,370 complaints, said viewers might wrongly conclude that 
one vaccine dose would be sufficient – and that social distancing and mask wearing would not be necessary 
following vaccination.
This was because the advert featured imagery of people who were not socially distancing or wearing masks, it 
noted.
"We considered this could encourage vaccinated individuals to disregard or lessen their adherence to restrictions, 
which in the short term could expose them to the risk of serious illness, and in the longer term might result in them 
spreading the virus.
"As such we considered the ads could encourage people to behave irresponsibly once vaccinated," the watchdog 
said.
Ryanair said it would comply with the ruling but disagreed with the "baseless" findings.
"The advert is both factual and accurate, it promotes bookings for Easter and summer 2021 on the basis that 
vaccines are coming, which is exactly what [UK] Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed," the Dublin-based 
carrier said in a statement.
Wednesday's ruling comes after Ryanair this week warned it will suffer a record annual loss of almost EUR1.0 
billion as the pandemic ravages demand for air travel.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday posted another sharp drop in traffic in January, as the aviation 
and travel industry continues to be hit by Covid-19 curbs. 
Traffic plunged 88% annually in January to just 1.3 million passengers from 10.8 million a year earlier. 
January last year was before the full onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Ryanair's first traffic fall in 2020 was March's 
48% plunge. 
The Irish carrier said it operated just 15% of its normal January schedule, with a 68% load factor.
On a rolling annual basis, traffic was down 72% at 42.6 million passengers, highlighting just how badly the sector 
has been hit by Covid-19 for close to a year now. 
The data comes in the wake of Ryanair on Monday reporting a sharp swing to loss in its third quarter. 
Passenger traffic in the Christmas and New Year period was "severely impacted" by travel restrictions as many 
governments in Europe imposed curbs on UK arrivals to stem the spread of a more contagious variant of Covid-19.
In its financial third quarter ended December 31, Ryanair's revenue plunged 82% year-on-year to EUR341.2 million 
from EUR1.91 billion. The carrier swung to a EUR362.5 million pretax loss, from a EUR81.6 million profit a year 
earlier.
It also posted a EUR306 million third-quarter net loss, swinging from a EUR88 million profit.
"Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across the industry. Christmas & New Year traffic was severely impacted by 
UK travel bans imposed at short notice by many EU governments on December 19 and 20," Ryanair said on 
Monday.

Looking ahead, Ryanair expects a full-year net loss between EUR850 million and EUR950 million, before 
exceptional items. It made a EUR649 million post-tax profit in the year ended March 2020. 
Ryanair shares were up 2.2% at EUR14.71 each in London on Tuesday morning.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a sharp third-quarter swing to loss on Monday and the airline again 
hit out at "unlawful state aid" of European flag carriers as the aviation industry remains mostly grounded by Covid-
19. 
The budget carrier's traffic around the Christmas and New Year period was "severely impacted" by travel 
restrictions as many governments in Europe imposed curbs on UK arrivals to stem the spread of a more contagious 
variant of Covid-19. 
In its financial third quarter ended December 31, Ryanair's revenue plunged 82% year-on-year to EUR341.2 million 
from EUR1.91 billion. The carrier swung to a EUR362.5 million pretax loss, from a EUR81.6 million profit a year 
earlier. 
It also posted a EUR306 million third-quarter net loss, swinging from a EUR88 million profit. 
"Covid-19 continues to wreak havoc across the industry. Christmas & New Year traffic was severely impacted by 
UK travel bans imposed at short notice by many EU governments on December 19 and 20," Ryanair said. 
The restrictions and flight bans saw third-quarter traffic plunge by 78% to just 8.1 million passengers from 35.9 
million a year earlier. In December alone, traffic was down 83%. 
In January, Ryanair said it expected traffic for the financial year ending in March of between 26 million and 30 
million, reduced from its previous guidance of "below 35 million".
Load factor in the third quarter came in at 70%, down from 96% a year earlier. 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Sinks To Third-Quarter Loss As Virus "Wreaks Havoc"
"The Covid pandemic has caused the closure of EU airlines including Flybe, Germanwings, Level and Montenegro 
Airlines. Norwegian has already entered a creditor protection examinership and Eurocontrol predicts more EU 
airline failures in 2021," Ryanair added. 
Not for the first time, Ryanair hit out at the extent state aid has been handed to flag carriers such as Deutsche 
Lufthansa AG and Air France KLM SA. 
"This illegal state aid distorts competition and the level playing field across EU aviation," the company said on 
Monday. 
Last summer, the airline frequently lambasted state bailouts of beleaguered airlines. It labelled Lufthansa a "subsidy 
junkie" after it struck a EUR9 billion rescue deal. 
Looking ahead, Ryanair expects a full-year net loss between EUR850 million and EUR950 million, before 
exceptional items. It made a EUR649 million post-tax profit in the year ended March 2020. 
The company added: "Financial 2021 will continue to be the most challenging year in Ryanair's 35-year history.
"While Q4 visibility remains limited due to uncertain and constantly changing Covid-19 travel restrictions, European 
Govt lockdowns, the timing of the rollout of vaccines across the EU and a very close-in booking curve, we are 
cautiously guiding an FY21 net loss (pre-exceptional items) of between EUR850 million and EUR950 million."
Looking further ahead, the company eyes having a "lower cost base and a strong balance sheet" as it re-emerges 
from the Covid-19 crisis, allowing it sweep up market share and "growth opportunities" as struggling European 
competitors reduce intra-Europe capacity.
To do so, Ryanair said it will be aided by a strong financial position. It has EUR3.5 billion in cash on December 31, 
while 80% of its owned fleet of aircraft was unencumbered and has a book value of EUR7 billion.

COMPANIES
----------
Hargreaves Lansdown reported a rise in interim earnings and lifted its payout, adding that its second half has 
started strongly. For the half year ended December 31, net new business rose 40% to GBP3.24 billion from 
GBP2.31 billion a year ago. Pretax profit was up 10% to GBP188.4 million from GBP171.1 million. Total assets 
under administration as at December 31 was GBP120.6 million, up 15% from GBP105.2 billion at the same time in 
2019. The fund supermarket said it added 1.5 million active clients, which was an increase of 84,000 since June 30. 
Hargreaves raised its interim dividend by 6% to 11.9 pence per share. "As our client numbers continue to grow, we 
are finding that younger people are taking a greater interest in investing for the future, with the average age of our 
clients continuing to fall. Covid-19 has underpinned the importance of financial resilience and Hargreaves 
Lansdown is well placed to support clients with their saving and investment needs across their lifetimes," said Chief 
Executive Officer Chris Hill.

BP said it will sell its 20% interest in Block 61, Oman to PTT Exploration & Production for GBP2.6 billion. PTT 
Exploration is Thailand's national petroleum company. BP owned a 60% stake in Block 61, while Makarim Gas 
Development has 30% stake and Petronas unit PC Oman Ventures owns 10%. Following completion of the sale - 
which is expected to occur in 2021 - BP will remain operator of the block, with a 40% stake. The consideration for

the sale comprises USD2.45 billion payable on completion and USD140 million payable dependent on pre-agreed 
future conditions.
----------
Ryanair Holdings posted a sharp third-quarter swing to loss and the airline again hit out at "unlawful state aid" of 
European flag carriers as the aviation industry remains mostly grounded by Covid-19. The budget carrier's traffic 
around the Christmas and New Year period was "severely impacted" by travel restrictions as many governments in 
Europe imposed curbs on UK arrivals to stem the spread of a more contagious variant of Covid-19. In its financial 
third quarter ended December 31, Ryanair's revenue plunged 82% year-on-year to EUR341.2 million from EUR1.91 
billion. The carrier swung to a EUR362.5 million pretax loss, from a EUR81.6 million profit a year earlier. It also 
posted a EUR306 million third-quarter net loss, swinging from a EUR88 million profit. The restrictions and flight 
bans saw third-quarter traffic plunge by 78% to just 8.1 million passengers from 35.9 million a year earlier. In 
December alone, traffic was down 83%. In January, Ryanair said it expected traffic for the financial year ending in 
March of between 26 million and 30 million, reduced from its previous guidance of "below 35 million".
----------
Ferguson said it has completed the GBP308 million sale of heating & plumbing distribution business Wolseley UK 
to US private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. The FTSE 100 plumbing and heating products distributor 
announced the sale in early January, at the time stating the disposal means it will be able to "focus entirely" on its 
North American business. In the financial year ended July 31, Wolseley UK generated revenue of USD1.88 billion. 
At the time, Ferguson also said it intends to return substantially all of the net proceeds of the disposal to 
shareholders by way of a special dividend
----------
JD Sports Fashion said it has agreed to buy Baltimore, Maryland-based footwear and apparel streetwear retailer 
DTLR Villa for USD495 million. DTLR Villa is currently majority owned by BRS & Co and Goode Capital, and 
operates from 247 stores across 19 states, principally in the north and east of the US. In the year ended February 
1, 2020, DTLR deliver earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of USD45.6 million and a 
pretax profit of USD1.6 million. JD Sports's cash consideration is being funded from cash resources and existing 
bank facilities. 
----------
ASOS said it has acquired four brands from beleaguered Arcadia Group Ltd, including UK high street staples 
Topshop and Topman. ASOS will pay GBP265 million for the four brands - including Miss Selfridge and HIIT as well 
- and also buy GBP30 million in stock upfront. HIIT was a sub-brand of menswear retailer Burton, which ASOS has 
chosen not to acquire. The online retailer is only buying the stock and the brands, so the physical stores still will 
close. The deal does mean roughly 300 jobs will be saved "across design, buying and retail partnerships". The AIM-
listed firm said the acquisitions represent a "compelling strategic opportunity" to become "the number one 
destination for fashion loving 20-somethings worldwide".

AstraZeneca will increase its coronavirus vaccine deliveries to the EU by 30%, European Commission Chief Ursula 
von der Leyen said Sunday as the bloc sought to claw back time lost rolling out the jabs. The British-Swedish 
company had announced last week that it could deliver only a quarter of the doses originally promised to the bloc 
for the first quarter of the year because of problems at one of its European factories. But AstraZeneca, whose 
vaccine was authorised for use in the EU on Friday, has now agreed to send nine million additional doses and "will 
start deliveries one week earlier than scheduled", Von der Leyen said in a tweet. An EU source told AFP the first 
deliveries would start in the second week of February. AstraZeneca would also extend its production capacity in 
Europe, Von der Leyen added. The EU leader was tweeting after talks Sunday with the leaders of the drugs 
companies that have signed vaccine contracts with the EU.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK manufacturing sector activity slowed in January as temporary supply-chain disruptions caused by Covid-19 
restrictions hurt orders. The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index fell to a three-month 
low of 54.1 points in January, down from December's three-year high of 57.5. Still, the latest reading beat the 
market forecast, cited by FXStreet, of 52.9 points. It was also above the 50.0 mark, which separates growth from 
decline. Survey responses were collected from January 12 to January 26. Markit highlighted that the upturn in the 
UK manufacturing sector slowed sharply at the start of 2021.
----------
Growth in the eurozone's manufacturing economy remained resilient in January, data from IHS Markit showed. 
After accounting for seasonal factors, the purchasing managers' index recorded 54.8 points in January, down 
slightly on December's 55.2 and little-changed on the earlier flash reading. A figure above 50.0 points denotes the 
sector is in growth territory. IHS Markit highlighted that January's figure was amongst the highest seen over the past 
two-and-a-half years. In Germany, meanwhile, at 57.1 points in January, the headline IHS Markit/BME 
manufacturing PMI remained firmly inside growth territory, albeit down from December's near three-year high of 
58.3.
----------
Manufacturing activity in China slowed at the start of 2021, with slower increases in output and new orders, and 
stock shortages and shipping delays hindering supplier performance, data from Caixin and IHS Markit showed. The 
Caixin China headline seasonally adjusted purchasing managers' index decreased to 51.5 in January from 53.0 in 
December, but remained above the neutral mark of 50, reflecting continued growth. Chinese good producers noted 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Hargreaves Lansdown Gets Boost From Young Investors
a sustained rise in output in January, making it the 11th consecutive month of output growth, however it was the 
slowest rate of growth since April 2020, which was attributed to a drop in export orders due to the Covid-19 
pandemic.
----------
A group of 10 Republican senators have written US President Joe Biden to propose an alternative to his massive 
Covid-19 relief plan, arguing that their approach - worth USD600 billion, according to reports - could garner the 
bipartisan support he has said he seeks. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said on 
Twitter that she had joined the group, which asked the president in a letter Friday for a meeting to discuss their 
plan. She said the group would release details of their plan on Monday. "We've received the letter and we certainly 
will be reviewing it," Brian Deese, director of the president's National Economic Council, told CNN's State of the 
Union on Sunday. He said Biden was "open to ideas" but that action was needed immediately. The president's 
USD1.9 trillion plan, Deese added, had been "calibrated to the economic crisis that we face". The Republicans' 
alternative plan, according to reports, would be far smaller than that – around USD600 billion – likely much too 
small for many Democrats to accept.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
J Sainsbury reported sales growth in its third quarter and said it is on track to beat its previous profit guidance. For 
its financial year ending March, Sainsbury's expects underlying pretax profit of at least GBP330 million, meaning a 
potential 44% fall from GBP586 million in financial 2020 but beating previous expectations for at least GBP270 
million, as announced in early December. Sainsbury's said like-for-like sales in the nine weeks to January 2 - so 
including the key festive period - were up 9.3% year-on-year. For the whole of its third-quarter, like-for-like sales, 
excluding fuel, climbed 8.6%. Including fuel, like-for-like sales were up a more modest 3.2%.
----------
Ryanair hit out at the Irish government's latest travel restrictions, as well as its slow vaccination programme. The 
carrier now expects traffic for the financial year ending in March of between 26 million and 30 million, its guidance 
reduced from the previous forecast of "below 35 million". Ryanair did note, however, these flight cuts and further 
traffic reductions will not "materially affect" its net loss for the year to March 31. Ryanair expects its January traffic 
to fall to below 1.3 million passengers and Covid-19 restrictions could mean it may only carry 500,000 customers in 
each of February and March. The firm called on the UK and Ireland to speed up their vaccination programmes. 
Ryanair particularly hit out at Ireland, which it said has vaccinated just 4,000 people, ten times slower than 
Denmark, a population of a similar size.

Ladbrokes Coral owner Entain has made a GBP250 million recommended offer for Enlabs, extending the UK 
bookmaker into Baltic markets. The SEK40 per share offer values Enlabs at SEK2.80 billion, about GBP250 million. 
"The acquisition is expected to be earnings accretive in Entain's first full year of ownership," Entain said on Enlabs. 
Entain noted analyst consensus for 2021 shows Enlabs is estimated to generate net gaming revenue of EUR89.5 
million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of EUR23.5 million. "Enlabs 
predominantly operates online sports-betting and gaming brands across the fast-growing Baltic region with a small 
retail presence. It is the market leader in Latvia, the second largest in Estonia and a top-five operator in Lithuania," 
the bookmaker added. Entain said it had the support of the Enlabs board and shareholders representing 42% of the 
total. The agreed bid comes in the wake of Entain rejecting a potential takeover offer from its US partner, MGM 
Resorts International, deriding the offer as too low.
----------
B&M European reported strong revenue growth during its third quarter amid "unprecedented times" caused by the 
Covid-19 pandemic. The discount retailer headquartered in Luxembourg said total group revenue jumped 23% at 
constant currency in the 13 weeks to December 26, its third quarter. Revenue totalled GBP1.40 billion, which was 
up from GBP1.14 billion a year before.
B&M said its year-to-date total group revenue increased by 24% to GBP3.64 billion from GBP2.93 billion the 
previous year. Despite the revenue increases, B&M slightly nudged down its annual earnings forecast. It now 
expects adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of between GBP540 million and 
GBP570 million. Previous guidance issued in December was for an adjusted Ebitda of between GBP600 million and 
GBP650 million. The company declared a special dividend of 20p per share. 
----------
Mitchells & Butlers is exploring an equity raise as the bar owner faces another extended period of time with none of 
its sites open. "No decision has yet been made with regards to the timing, size, or terms of any such equity capital 
raise," the All Bar One owner added. Mitchells, which also owns brands including Harvester and Toby Carvery, said 
its board is "unanimous" in supporting the equity raise. The firm said it has had no sites open since December 30. 
For the 14 weeks to January 2, total sales were down 67% year-on-year, with like-for-like sales - when its sites 
were open - down 30% year-on-year. The company noted it has GBP125 million cash on hand, but has withdrawn 
all of its available facilities. It also noted its ongoing monthly cash burn of about GBP35 million to GBP40 million and 
has GBP50 million debt service payments per quarter to contend with.

MARKETS

The FTSE 100 slipped into the red mid-morning on Thursday, though European peers in Paris and Frankfurt were 
0.2% and 0.4% higher, respectively. 
"The shocking events on Capitol Hill appear thus far to have been taken in their stride, showing once and for all that 
global investors care more for monetary and fiscal stimulus than they do about political unrest, wherever it may be," 
CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said. 
US stock market futures are higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average called up 0.3%, the S&P 500 up 0.4%

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Outgoing US President Donald Trump on Thursday offered the clearest signal yet that he will voluntarily leave office 
on January 20, saying there will be an "orderly transition" to Joe Biden's presidency. "Even though I totally disagree 
with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on 
January 20th," Trump said in a statement minutes after the US Congress formally certified Biden's victory. The 
House and Senate certified the Democrat's electoral college win early on Thursday after a violent throng of pro-
Trump rioters spent hours on Wednesday running rampant through the Capitol.
----------
Some 52 people were arrested and four people died as masses of angry pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol, 
Washington DC police Chief Robert Contee said. One woman was shot by police in the Capitol building, and later 
died in hospital, Contee said. Another woman and two men died as a result of separate medical emergencies. 
Moreover, four people were arrested on weapons charges and 47 were arrested for violating the nighttime curfew 
which went into place at 6pm Wednesday. Contee went on to say that at least 14 police officers were injured in the 
clashes, two of them seriously. One of those officers was pulled into the crowd by protesters, where he was 
attacked and the second suffered significant facial injuries when he was hit by a projectile, he said. The protests 
began hours after Trump riled up his supporters with baseless allegations of election fraud and encouraged them to 
march to the Capitol.
----------
Housebuilders led the way as the UK's construction sector posted another month of growth in December, IHS 
Markit said on Thursday. The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS UK construction total activity index 
reading was 54.6 points in December, narrowly below 54.7 from November but still well above the 50.0 no-change 
threshold. House building was the best performing category, with an index score of 61.9, topping commercial 
activity at 51.2 and the declining civil engineering sector at 48.0, Markit data showed. 
----------
The eurozone's construction downturn gathered pace in December, falling for the tenth month in succession, 
numbers on Thursday showed. The IHS Markit eurozone construction total activity index slipped ever-so-slightly to 
45.5 in December from 45.6 in November. The decline in Germany's construction sector eased, with IHS Markit's 
construction purchasing managers' index rising to 47.1 in December from 45.6 in November, indicating a slower fall 
in activity. Though still in contraction territory, it was the highest reading in four months. France however, saw its 
sharpest decline in construction activity for seven months. The headline France construction PMI slumped to 40.5 in 
December from 42.5 in November.

China reported 63 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday – the highest single-day tally since July – as authorities try 
to stamp out an outbreak of the virus in a city of 11 million near Beijing. The virus first emerged in central China in 
late 2019, but since then authorities have largely brought the situation under control through travel restrictions, strict 
lockdowns and mass testing. But a recent outbreak in northern Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, has seen 
cases spike and prompted mass testing, school closures and travel links being cut into the province. On Thursday, 
there were 51 more cases reported in the province, the National Health Commission reported – plus another 69 
asymptomatic cases. State broadcaster CCTV showed a small crowd gathered outside a railway station in 
Shijiazhuang being directed by medical staff in full hazmat suits and protective wear.
----------
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened sanctions against individuals and organisations involved in the 
arrest of dozens of Hong Kong democracy figures, voicing anger that an American was among those rounded up. 
Pompeo said the 53 people arrested Wednesday "should be released immediately and unconditionally". Pompeo, 
who remains in office for two weeks, said the US would also "explore restrictions" against the financial hub's trade 
representative office in Washington. In an operation involving 1,000 officers, Hong Kong police arrested the activists 
for "subversion" in an escalation of Beijing's imposition of a tough security law in the wake of huge and sometimes 
violent democracy protests in 2019. Pompeo, a vehement critic of Beijing, said he was "appalled" by the arrest of 
John Clancey, a lawyer working for a firm known to take up human rights cases.

----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings and Wizz Air Holdings confirmed that UK shareholders will have little or no say in the running of 
the two European budget airlines, starting from Friday. Dublin-based Ryanair said it "must take steps" to ensure 
that it will remain majority EU owned and controlled following the end of the Brexit transition period. The Irish carrier 
said it will treat all shares held by non-EU nationals, including UK nationals, as restricted shares from Friday. This 
means the holders of the shares will not be entitled to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting. Ryanair also 
said it will extend its existing prohibition on non-EU nationals buying ordinary shares to apply to Britons. It said UK 
nationals will not be required to sell shares they already own, but they will lose all say in the running of the 
company. EU nationals including nationals of EU member states, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and 
Liechtenstein. Meanwhile, Budapest-based Wizz Air said it will issue restricted share notices to UK shareholders on 
Tuesday.
----------
Admiral Group said it has come to an agreement with ZPG Comparison Services Holdings UK to offload its Penguin 
Portals and Preminen price comparison sites for a total value of GBP508 million. Penguin Portals is made up of 
online comparison portals Confused.com, Rastreator.com and LeLynx.fr, technology operations Admiral 
Technologies and its 50% share of Preminen Price Comparison Holdings. Admiral expects net proceeds of around 
GBP450 million, with a majority of this to be returned to shareholders but will hold back a portion to support new 
investments. Admiral expects the deal to close in the first half of 2021. ZPG, which means Zoopla Property Group,

THG Holdings agreed to acquire US-based online skincare and beauty brands retailer Dermstore.com for USD350 
million in cash from major retailer Target Corp, subject to US regulatory approval. The Manchester-based retailer, 
also known as The Hut Group, said the Dermstore.com acquisition will provide it with the opportunity to "accelerate 
the growth" of its own beauty brands via a new and large US customer base. In addition, THG acquired two of its 
long-standing UK-based nutrition product suppliers, Claremont Ingredients and David Berryman, for a combined 
purchase price of GBP59.5 million in cash.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Labour leader Keir Starmer is facing a high-profile revolt over his decision to back UK Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson's EU trade deal in this week's Commons vote. Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and ex-cabinet 
minister Ben Bradshaw are among the signatories to a statement calling on opposition parties not to support the 
"rotten" agreement, The Guardian reported. Starmer has said that he will call on Labour MPs to support the "thin" 
post-Brexit free trade agreement, despite misgivings that it would fail to protect many key economic sectors. He 
argued, however, that the alternative of ending the Brexit transition period on December 31 without a deal in place 
would be even worse for the economy.

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair , Wizz Air Restrict Non-EU Voting Rights
The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives has voted to override Donald Trump's presidential veto of 
a defence policy bill. House members voted 322-87 to cancel the veto, well above the two-thirds needed to 
override. If approved by two-thirds of the Senate, the override would be the first of Trump's presidency. Trump 
rejected the bill last week, saying it failed to limit social media companies he claims were biased against him during 
his failed re-election campaign. Trump also opposes language that allows for the renaming of military bases that 
honour Confederate leaders.
----------
The US House of Representatives has voted to increase Covid-19 relief cheques in the country to USD2,000, 
meeting President Donald Trump's demand for bigger payments and sending the bill to the Republican-controlled 
Senate, where the outcome is uncertain. Democrats led passage of the motion, by 275-134, their majority favouring 
additional assistance. They had earlier settled for smaller USD600 payments in a compromise with Republicans 
over the big year-end relief bill Trump reluctantly signed into law. The vote divides Republicans who mostly resist 
more spending, although many House Republicans joined in support, wary of opposing the president's wishes. 
Senators are set to return to session on Tuesday to consider the measure, with stiff resistance expected.

COMPANIES
----------
Tesco said it will repay GBP585 million of business rates relief received from the UK government as a result of the 
Covid-19 pandemic. In March, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said the UK government would give all 
retail, hospitality and leisure businesses a 100% business rates holiday for the next 12 months, with the holiday 
intended to help companies weather the pandemic. On Wednesday, the FTSE 100-listed grocer stated it is 
"immensely grateful" for the support provided, describing it as a "game-changer" which ensured customers got 
access to the essentials they needed. Tesco added that all the funds from rates relief was spent on its response to 
the pandemic as food retailers had to deal with panic buying, pressure on supply lines, safety concerns and the risk 
of mass absences from work. However, it noted its latest estimate showed Covid-19 would cost the company

Garda World Security declared an increased and final cash offer of 235 pence per share for G4S valuing the 
London-listed security services firm at GBP3.68 billion. G4S, in its own statement on Wednesday, said it is currently 
evaluating the revised offer and advised shareholders to take no action in the meantime. In September, the board of 
the FTSE 250-listed firm rejected Montreal-based GardaWorld's cash offer, saying it undervalued the company. 
However, in October, GardaWorld directly approached G4S shareholders with that same GBP3 billion offer.

Budget airline Ryanair posted a severe year-on-year fall in passenger numbers in November, as did central and 
eastern Europe-focused airline Wizz Air Holdings, caused by renewed travel restrictions. For November, Ryanair

deterioration from October, when passenger numbers had fallen by 70% year-on-year. For the same month, Wizz 
Air reported a 85% decline in passenger numbers to 456,487 from 3.0 million a year before. Capacity was reduced

The UK government said it has authorised Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine, becoming the first country in 
the world to give the jab the green light. Pfizer said the approval marked a "historic moment" in the fight against 
Covid-19. The UK government said it accepted the recommendation from the Medicines & Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency to approve the vaccine for use. "This follows months of rigorous clinical trials and a thorough 
analysis of the data by experts at the MHRA who have concluded that the vaccine has met its strict standards of 
safety, quality and effectiveness," a Department of Health & Social Care spokesperson said. The Joint Committee 
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK First Country To Give Pfizer Vaccine Thumbs Up
on Vaccinations & Immunisations will publish its final advice for the priority groups to receive the vaccine, which 
includes care home residents, health and care staff and the elderly. The vaccine will be made available across the 
UK from next week.

A strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions has replaced England's second national lockdown after 
Boris Johnson suffered the largest Tory rebellion of this Parliament. Despite the bruising revolt, the Commons 
backed the UK prime minister's new measures meaning 99% of the nation entered the toughest Tier 2 and 3 
restrictions on Wednesday. The tiers will be reviewed every fortnight and Johnson promised MPs a fresh vote on 
whether to keep the system before February 2.

Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned he can not guarantee he will strike a trade deal with Britain, 
diplomats said, and the next few days will be crucial. "We are quickly approaching a make or break moment in the 
Brexit talks," Barnier told a video meeting of European envoys, a diplomat said, in an account of the video meeting 
confirmed by other sources. "Intensive negotiations are continuing in London, but as of this morning it is still unclear 
whether negotiators can bridge the gaps on issues like level playing field, governance and fisheries," Barnier said.

Shop prices in the UK fell in November, data showed, as non-food retailers attempted to boost consumer spending 
with discounts. According to the British Retail Consortium-Nielsen shop price index, prices fell 1.8% annually in 
November, having been 1.2% lower in October. November's figure was also below the 12-month average decline of 
1.3% and the 6-month average price decrease of 1.5%. Non-food prices were 3.7% lower year-on-year in 
November, compared to a 2.7% annual drop in October. Food inflation was at 1.3% in November, rising from 1.2% 
in October but below the 12-month average increase of 1.4%. However, the figure was in line with the 1.3% 6-
month average price increase. Month-on-month, the shop price index for November was 0.6% lower, with non-food 
prices down 0.9% while food inflation was flat.
----------
Eurozone unemployment eased in October, figures showed. Eurostat said the euro area's seasonally-adjusted 
unemployment rate was 8.4% in October, down from 8.5% in September. In October 2019, the jobless rate was 
7.4%. Compared with September, the number of those out of work fell by 86,000. For the wider EU, September's 
jobless rate in October was 7.6%, stable on the month before, and unemployment fell by 91,000. A separate 
release from Eurostat on Wednesday showed producer prices rose 0.4% in the euro area month-on-month, 
matching September's reading. Annually, prices fell by 2.0%, an improvement on the 2.3% fall posted for 
September.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a swing to loss in the first half of its financial year as 
traffic fell 80% with almost its entire fleet grounded for months during the period as a result of Covid-19 travel bans 
and lockdowns. 
The Swords, Ireland-based budget airline reported a swing to a EUR432.3 million pretax loss for the six months 
ended September 30, from the prior year's EUR1.26 billion profit.
Total operating revenue plunged 78% to EUR1.18 billion from EUR5.39 billion as traffic dropped 80% to 17.1 
million. There was almost no traffic whatsoever in the first quarter, with 99% of Ryanair's fleet grounded from mid-
March to June end as a result of EUR government measures to control the spread of Covid-19 including travel bans 
and population lockdowns.
While Ryanair did resume flights in July across most of its route network, operating at 60% of the prior year capacity 
in the second quarter with more than 70% load factors, passenger confidence took a hit at flight restrictions return in 
September and October.
Consequently, Ryanair recently reduced its financial 2021 traffic guidance to around 38 million guests.
"This takes the group's W.20 (Nov-Mar) capacity down from the previously guided 60% to at most 40% of prior year 
traffic," Ryanair explained.
In terms of outlook, the company said: "FY21 will continue to be a hugely challenging year for Ryanair. Given the 
current Covid-19 uncertainty, Ryanair cannot provide FY21 PAT guidance at this time. The group expects to carry 
approximately 38 million passengers in FY21, although this guidance could be further revised downwards if EU 
governments continue to mismanage air travel and impose more uncoordinated travel restrictions or lock downs this 
winter. The group expects to record higher losses in H2 than in H1.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Swings To Loss As Covid-19 Leads To 80% Traffic Drop
"As we look beyond the Covid-19 crisis, and the emergence of effective vaccines in early 2021, the Ryanair group 
expects to have a lower cost base, a stronger balance sheet, which will enable it to fund lower fares, and add new 
lower cost aircraft to capitalise on the many growth opportunities that will be available in all markets across Europe, 
especially where competitor airlines have substantially cut capacity or failed."

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Associated British Foods said it estimates a GBP375 million loss of sales as a result of Primark stores being forced 
to close again in England and the rest of Europe. All Primark stores are temporarily closed in the Republic of 
Ireland, France, Belgium, Wales, Catalonia in Spain and Slovenia - accounting for 19% of the company's total retail 
selling space. On top of this, the UK government now intends to close non-essential stores in England for one 
month starting Thursday this week and ending December 2. Should this plan obtain parliamentary approval, it 
would mean that 57% of the company's total selling space would be temporarily closed from Thursday, with 156 
Primark stores trading and 231 stores not trading.
----------
Ocado Group raised its earnings guidance for its current financial year, driven by strong trading from its joint 
venture with Marks & Spencer in the fourth quarter. The online grocer also announced the acquisition of two 
companies, Kindred Systems and Haddington Dynamics, for USD287 million in total. For the financial year to the 
end of November, Ocado has raised its Ebitda guidance and expects the figure to be over GBP60 million, 
compared to previous guidance of GBP40 million. This means a minimum of a 39% rise from GBP43.3 million the 
year before.

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: AB Foods And GVC Warn On UK Lockdown Hit
Ryanair Holdings reported a swing to loss in the first half of its financial year as traffic fell 80% with almost its entire 
fleet grounded for months during the period as a result of Covid-19 travel bans and lockdowns. The Swords, 
Ireland-based budget airline reported a swing to a EUR432.3 million pretax loss for the six months ended 
September 30, from the prior year's EUR1.26 billion profit. Total operating revenue plunged 78% to EUR1.18 billion 
from EUR5.39 billion as traffic dropped 80% to 17.1 million.
----------
GVC Holdings guided for a hit to earnings as a result of renewed lockdown restrictions in the UK and Europe. The 
betting shop operator said the hit to group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would be 
GBP37 million, based on the restrictions and guidelines currently in place. Of this figure, GBP27 million would be in 
its UK retail unit, and GBP10 million in its European business. The current restrictions include stores being closed in 
England from Thursday to the start of December, Scotland and Northern Ireland stores remaining open, Welsh 
stores reopening on Monday next week, and all stores remaining closed in the Republic of Ireland until December 
9. In Europe, stores are closed in Italy and Belgium until November 24 and December 13 respectively. Should all of 
GVC's retail outlets be closed for a whole month, it would inflict a GBP43 million hit to the group's Ebitda. 
----------
Lloyd's of London underwriter Hiscox said its gross written premiums edged upwards for the first nine months of 
2020, driven by strong growth from nearly all of its businesses. As at September 30, Hiscox reported gross written 
premiums at USD3.26 billion in the year to date, a 2% increase from USD3.21 billion as of the same date a year 
before. The insurer's Retail business remained the largest contributor, with a 4% year-on-year rise in gross written 
premiums to USD1.73 billion, driven by the easing of government restrictions and a steady increase in economic 
activity, together with a shift toward digital. There has been no change to the group's previous estimate for Covid-19 
related claims, which total USD387 million net of reinsurance. However, should travel restrictions continue into 
2021, Hiscox has an additional USD30 million to USD40 million in potential exposure relating to event cancellations.
----------
MARKETS
----------
The FTSE 100 posted gains by late Monday morning, though airlines and non-essential retailers were hurt by UK 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing a one-month lockdown in England. AB Foods and GVC, who warned of 
earnings hits, were down 0.1% and 1.7%, respectively. 
"European markets have started the week on a positive footing, with pre-market declines failing to come to fruition 
despite the implementation of a four-week lockdown in the UK. With the US heading to the polls tomorrow, there in 
plenty of volatility to come," IG Senior Market Analyst Joshua Mahony commented. 
US futures indicate Wall Street is set to bounce back from Friday's losses. The Nasdaq Composite is called up 
1.1%, the S&P 500 1.3% higher, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 1.4%.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
England's four-week national lockdown could be extended beyond December 2 if coronavirus infection rates do not 
significantly fall, a UK Cabinet minister has admitted. Michael Gove said he believed the restrictions announced by 
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson would bring down the R value, but warned that people may have to stay at home 
for longer if not. Pubs, bars, restaurants and non-essential retail will close from Thursday for four weeks across 
England, with furlough payments at 80% extended for the duration of the new measures. People will be allowed to 
exercise and socialise in public spaces outside with their household or one other person, but not indoors or in 
private gardens, and will be able to travel to work if they cannot work from home. Yet unlike in the lockdown during 
the first wave of the pandemic, schools, colleges and nurseries will remain open.
----------
The UK's manufacturing growth slowed somewhat in October, data showed, though it did outperform flash 
estimates despite signs that pent-up demand after the Spring lockdown is losing steam. The seasonally adjusted 
IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index slipped to 53.7 in October, down from 54.1 in September. The 
reading was above the 50.0 figure which separates growth from decline and also above the 53.3 flash estimate 
issued on October 23, IHS Markit noted. "The recovery in the UK manufacturing sector continued at the start of the 
final quarter, as output and new orders rose again supported by improved demand from both domestic and 
overseas sources. That said, the upturn showed further signs of losing impetus, as the initial boost to growth from 
the economy reopening faded and job losses accelerated," IHS Markit commented. 
----------
The eurozone's manufacturing sector notched up its fourth successive month of growth, with Germany leading the 
way and only Greece showing a decline. The IHS Markit eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index 
came in at 54.8 in October, improved from 53.7 in September. "October's number was also the best recorded by the 
survey for 27 months and maintained the current run of continuous growth that began in July," IHS Markit said. IHS 
Markit noted that Germany was the best performing nation, with its PMI climbing to a 31-month high of 58.2. Italy 
also climbed to a 31-month high, registering 53.8. 
----------
China's manufacturing activity expanded for the sixth straight month in October, reaching its highest level since 
January 2011. The Caixin China general manufacturing purchasing managers' index reading for last month was 
53.6 points, up from 53.0 points in September. Survey data showed business conditions across the sector 
improved, with firms recording rises in both output and total new work. However, growth in new export sales 
softened notably amid a resurgence of the novel coronavirus across a number of export markets. Despite this, 
stronger overall market conditions led to an improvement in business confidence, which was the highest since 
August 2014. On Saturday, official data showed a slightly less positive PMI reading of 51.4 points, slightly down 
from 51.5 in September, but also still showing expansion.
----------
More than 1.2 million people have died of coronavirus around the globe, according to an AFP tally from official 
sources at  0745 GMT on Monday. The over 1.2 million deaths had been recorded from 46.5 million cases, with 
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: AB Foods And GVC Warn On UK Lockdown Hit
nearly one death in every five in the US, the world's worst-hit country. The US has seen 230,996 deaths from 9.2 
million infections with Brazil registering 160,074 fatalities from 5.5 million cases, India 122,607 deaths and 8.2 
million cases, Mexico 91,895 deaths and 929,392 cases and Britain 46,717 deaths from 1.0 million cases.

(Alliance News) - Irish dairy products producer Glanbia PLC on Thursday announced its intention to launch a 
EUR50 million share buyback program, as it reported a slight rise in year-to-date revenue on improving trends, 
despite challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.
For the nine months ended October 3, the company recorded a 1.0% rise in revenue year-on-year. The 
improvement was attributed to price growth of 4.8%, offset by a volume decline of 1.7%. Acquisitions delivered 
0.6% revenue growth year-to-date.
Price growth reflected strong cheese markets in the period in Glanbia Nutritionals division. Volume decline was in 
the Glanbia Performance Nutrition business, primarily as a result of Covid-19, Glanbia said.
For the fourth quarter of 2020, the company expects the Glanbia Nutritionals division and joint ventures to continue 
to deliver a resilient earnings performance in addition to further sequential improvement in Glanbia Performance 
Nutrition.  
"Good operating cash flow is expected to continue in the fourth quarter with net debt to adjusted earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ratio anticipated to be below two times by year-end," the company 
added.
The EUR50 million share buyback program was attributed to "strong cash flows" by Glanbia, providing an 
opportunity to allocate capital to benefit shareholders.
Glanbia also said that John Daly will step down as independent non-executive director with effect from November 1, 
and Mary Minnick will step down as director on December 31.
Jane Lodge and Roisin Brennan will join the board as independent non-executive directors effective from the start 
of November 2020 and January 2021, respectively.
Glanbia To Return EUR50 Million Amid "Strong Cash Flows"
Lodge is a former senior audit partner of accountancy firm Deloitte. She currently sits on boards of DCC PLC, 
Costain Group PLC and Bakkavor Group PLC.
Brennan is a former chief executive officer of IBI Corporate Finance Ltd and has over 20 years of investing banking 
experience, particularly advising public companies in Ireland.  She is currently a director of Ryanair Holdings PLC, 
Hibernia REIT PLC, Musgrave Group PLC and Dell Bank International DAC.
Shares in Glanbia were up 5.5% at EUR8.22 in London on Thursday morning.

(Alliance News) -  The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices on Friday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Rolls-Royce, up 7.5%. The jet engine maker's shares were higher after Bloomberg reported Europe's top aviation 
regulator is satisfied that changes to Boeing Co's 737 MAX have made the aircraft safe enough to return to the 
skies before 2020. According to Bloomberg, the European Aviation Safety Agency is performing final document 
reviews ahead of a draft airworthiness directive it expects to issue next month. That will be followed by four weeks 
of public comment, while the development of a so-called synthetic sensor to add redundancy will take 20 to 24 
months.
----------
Burberry Group, up 3.7%. The fashion house was benefitting from a positive read-across from French peer LVMH 
Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton. LVMH late Thursday reported improving trends in the third quarter. The Louis 
Vuitton and Christian Dior owner reported revenue of EUR30.3 billion in the first nine months of 2020, down 21% on 
a year ago on both a reported and organic basis. In the third quarter, revenue was down 7% organically, reflecting a 
"marked improvement" in trends versus the first half. LVMH shares were up 6.7% in Paris, hitting a record high in 
early trade.

Whitbread, up 3.5%. Berenberg upgraded the Premier Inn owner to Buy from Hold.

International Consolidated Airlines, down 2.5%. Shares in the British Airways parent were lower after the UK 
government late Thursday dealt a fresh blow to holidaymakers by adding Italy to its quarantine list. This means that 
travellers returning to the UK from Italy, Vatican City and San Marino as of 0400 BST on Sunday must self-isolate 
for two weeks. Ryanair was down 1.1%, easyJet down 1.6% and Wizz Air down 0.9%, though Jet2 was up 0.6%.
----------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
Serco Group, up 16%. The outsourcer updated its annual revenue guidance following strong growth in the third 
quarter of 2020 in conjunction with what it called good cost control. The Hook, Hampshire-based public services 
provider set its new full-year revenue guidance at around GBP3.9 billion, up from the previously set GBP3.7 billion, 
with an organic growth rate in revenue of around 15% year-on-year. Revenue in 2019 totalled GBP3.25 billion. 
Underlying trading profit is expected to be between GBP160 million and GBP165 million, up from GBP120.2 million 
in 2019. All regions are performing better than expected, the company said. 
----------
Man Group, 5.7%. The asset manager said "robust" net inflows and positive investment performance led to a 4% 
rise in funds under management and the company remains "well-placed" to withstand market volatility. Man Group 
said FuM increased to USD113.1 billion at September 30 from USD108.3 billion at June 30, driven by net inflows of 
USD1.7 billion primarily from the company's Alternative Strategies as redemption levels normalised following Covid-
19 related rebalancing. Positive investment performance added USD1.7 billion to FuM and positive foreign 
exchange movements contributed USD1.4 billion, resulting from a weaker dollar particularly against sterling and the 
euro.
----------
Dixons Carphone, up 3.5%. RBC Capital upgraded the electrical goods retailer to Sector Perform from 
Underperform.
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
JD Wetherspoon, down 13%. The pub chain said it suffered severe losses in financial 2020 due to the Covid-19 
lockdown, which Chair Tim Martin said was full of "ill-thought-out regulations" and not based on science. The pub 
owner reported a pretax loss for the year ended July 26 of GBP34.1 million, swinging from a profit of GBP102.5 
million a year prior. Revenue fell 31% to GBP1.26 billion from GBP1.82 billion, with like-for-like sales down 30%. 
Wetherspoon put its poor performance down to the effects of the closure of pubs by the UK government in March, 
which lasted for around three months. The company opted to skip a final dividend, compared to last year's 12.0 
pence each. This brings the year's total payout to nothing, compared to last year's total payout of 16.0p. "Putting 
aside the validity of the government's approach, the reality is that unless pubs return quickly to normal or receive 
substantial support, then it'll soon be last orders for a significant number of favourite pubs and restaurants," 
commented eToro analyst Adam Vettese.

Loungers, up 8.9%. The bar and restaurant operator said like-for-like sales jumped by a quarter in the 13 weeks 
ended early October, but did note that rising Covid-19 cases mean it could be slapped with more restrictions again. 
The company, which operates 168 bars, cafes and restaurant sites in England and Wales, said a "significant 
outperformance of the market" since it reopened back in July has continued. In the 13 weeks to October, like-for-
like sales jumped 25% year-on-year. "Whilst the resurgence in Covid-19 cases increases the likelihood of additional 
trading restrictions, we remain very encouraged by the strength of our trading post reopening," Loungers said all of 
its sites are open at the moment.
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
Iofina, down 11%. The iodine producer posted a rise in third-quarter iodine production but said that production for 
the second half of 2020 will be at the lower end of estimates due to a brief pause in activity at one of the iodine 
plants. In the third quarter of 2020, Iofina produced 170.8 metric tonnes of crystalline iodine from its five operating 
IOsorb plants in the US state of Oklahoma, up 2.1% from 167.3 metric tonnes a year ago. In the first nine months of 
2020, the company produced 455 metric tonnes of crystalline iodine. Iofina said it remains on track to achieve the 
lower end of its 340,000 to 360,000 metric tonnes forecast for second half of 2020.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday said it has reduced its winter schedule further 
due to increased flight restrictions imposed by European governments, leading to further staff cuts. 
Winter capacity between November and March has been cut to 40% of the year prior's levels, reduced from the 
previously planned 60%.
The company expects the full-year traffic to be down by approximately 38 million passengers. This guidance could 
be further revised downwards if European governments continue to "mismanage air travel" and impose more 
lockdowns this winter, Ryanair said.
Tighter restrictions have been imposed through much of central Europe, including Ireland, Austria, Belgium, 
Portugal and the UK. 
These have led to slightly weaker bookings in October and substantially fewer bookings in November and 
December.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "We have continued to flex our capacity in September and October to reflect 
both market conditions and changing government restrictions, with the objective of sustaining a 70% load factor, 
which allows us operate as close to breakeven as possible and minimise cash burn. While the Covid-19 situation 
remains fluid and hard to predict, we must now cut our full year traffic forecast to 38 million guests."
Ryanair's financial year ends March 31.
Ryanair expects to maintain up to 65% of its winter route network, but with reduced frequencies.
The company also announced "significant" base aircraft cuts in Belgium, German, Spain, Portugal and Vienna. 
These are in addition to winter closures of bases in Cork and Shannon in Ireland and in Toulouse in France.

O'Leary said: "It is inevitable, given the scale of these cutbacks, that we will be implementing more unpaid leave, 
and job sharing this winter in those bases where we have agreed reduced working time and pay, but this is a better 
short term outcome than mass job losses.
"There will regrettably be more redundancies at those small number of cabin crew bases, where we have still not 
secured agreement on working time and pay cuts, which is the only alternative. We continue to actively manage our 
cost base to be prepared for the inevitable rebound and recovery of short haul air travel in Europe once an effective 
Covid-19 vaccine is developed."
O'Leary ended his statement urging all European governments to "immediately and fully" take on the EU 
Commision's traffic light system which permits air travel between European states for countries which are able to 
demonstrate that their Covid case rates are less than 50 per 100,000 population.
Ryanair shares were down 2.9% at EUR11.94 each in London on Thursday morning.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened lower on Thursday as fears over the possible reimposition of 
coronavirus lockdowns spooked investors, while airlines were in the red after Ryanair cut its planned winter 
capacity.
The large-cap FTSE 100 index was down 111.71 points, or 1.9%, at 5,823.35. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was 
down 207.78 points, or 1.2%, at 17,742.63. The AIM All-Share index was down 0.6% at 975.68.
The Cboe UK 100 index was off 1.5% at 581.59. The Cboe 250 was down 0.9% at 15,040.56, and the Cboe Small 
Companies down 0.1% at 9,432.45.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 1.2% while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 2.2%.
France on Wednesday became the latest European country to toughen anti-coronavirus measures, imposing a 
strict curfew in Paris and eight other cities from Saturday.
In addition, new cases of coronavirus infections in Germany have soared to 6,638 in the past 24 hours, official data 
showed, reaching a daily level not seen since the start of the pandemic. The alarming jump in numbers came just 
hours after Chancellor Angela Merkel met with the leaders of Germany's 16 federal states to agree tougher 
restrictions designed to slow the spread of the contagion.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also under increasing pressure to impose more stringent measures to cut 
spiralling infection rates in England, including a two-week "circuit-breaker" lockdown.
"A series of tougher Covid-19 restrictions across Europe sent the markets spiralling on Thursday, one of investors' 
regular reminders that, however much they try and deny it, the pandemic is still very much a thing," said Spreadex 
analyst Connor Campbell.

In the FTSE 100, Just Eat Takeaway.com was the only stock to open in the green, up 0.1%. The online takeaway 
platform was extending gains from Wednesday after reporting a big rise in orders. The stock ended up 6.4% on 
Wednesday. 
At the other end of the large caps, International Consolidated Airlines was down 5.7%. The British Airways parent 
was suffering a negative read-across after Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings said it will slash more flights this winter due 
to coronavirus restrictions. 
Ryanair was down 3.7%.
In the FTSE 250, budget airline easyJet was the worst performer, down 6.1%, while holiday airline Jet2, formerly 
Dart Group, was down 3.2%.
Ryanair said forward bookings have "materially" weakened in November and December due to increased flight 
restrictions imposed by EU governments. It will close its bases in Cork and Shannon in Ireland and in Toulouse in 
France this winter as Covid-19 continues to hurt the travel sector. 
In light of the weaker bookings, the Irish carrier further reduced its winter schedule, from November to March - 
taking capacity down to 40% from 60% of prior year. Ryanair said with the greatly reduced winter capacity and load 
factors of around 70%, it now expects full year traffic to fall to 38 million passengers. 
The budget airline said this guidance could be further revised downwards if EU government continue to 
"mismanage air travel and impose more lockdowns this winter".
Pearson was down 3.0% after Barclays cut the education publisher to Underweight from Equal Weight.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3000 early Thursday, lower from USD1.3029 at the London equities close on 
Wednesday.
Meanwhile, EU leaders are to take stock of the talks with the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal amid "frustration" in 
London at the slow progress.
Ahead of the latest EU summit in Brussels, Johnson voiced his "disappointment" that they had not been able to 
move forward more quickly on negotiations.
The UK PM had previously said that he would walk away from the negotiations unless there was an agreement by 
the time of the two-day gathering in the Belgian capital, starting Thursday.
However, in a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President 
Charles Michel on Wednesday evening, Johnson said he would "reflect" on the outcome of the summit before 
making a decision.
Meanwhile, von der Leyen and Michel reiterated that while the EU still wanted a deal, it could not be at "any price".
The euro was priced at USD1.1755, flat from USD1.1760. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY105.25, up 
from JPY105.07.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index ended down 0.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.2%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 1.2%.
The rise in Chinese consumer prices slowed for a second successive month in September, official data showed as 
pork supplies bounce back from the devastating African swine fever while farms recovered from flooding.
The consumer price index - a key gauge of retail inflation - rose 1.7% last month from a year ago, compared with a 
2.4% reading in August, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair has reduced its winter schedule further due to increased flight restrictions imposed by European 
governments, leading to further staff cuts. Winter capacity between November and March has been cut to 40% of 
the year prior's levels, reduced from the previously planned 60%. The company expects full-year traffic to be down 
by approximately 38 million passengers. This guidance could be further revised downwards if European 
governments continue to "mismanage air travel" and impose more lockdowns this winter, Ryanair said. Tighter 
restrictions have been imposed through much of central Europe, including Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Portugal and 
the UK. These have led to slightly weaker bookings in October and substantially fewer bookings in November and 
December.
----------
Rolls-Royce said it has priced GBP2 billion in a senior notes offering as part of its proposed debt and equity 
recapitalisation package. The bond offering comprises of USD1.00 billion 5.750% notes due 2027, EUR750 million 
4.625% notes due 2026 and GBP545 million 5.750% notes due 2027. The proposed GBP5 billion recapitalisation 
package aims to increase resilience, strengthen the balance sheet and support long-term strategy, according to 
Rolls-Royce, which has been badly damaged by Covid-19's impact on air travel. Initially, the intention was to raise 
approximately GBP1 billion through the offering, but the jet engine maker said that, given the strong demand from 
investors for the notes, it decided to increase the size of the offering.

----------
Mondi said it has delivered a resilient performance with underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation for the third quarter of EUR306 million. The Vienna-based packaging and paper company reported 
underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of EUR306 million for the third quarter of 
2020, 20% lower when compared with the prior year. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, underlying Ebitda 
was down 13% from EUR353 million. The business saw good volume growth in its uncoated fine paper and fibre-
based packaging products, which together with ongoing strong cost control were more than offset by the impact of 
planned maintenance shuts, negative currency effects and lower average selling prices.
----------
Ofcom said it will open up a probe into BT Group to assess whether the telecommunications firm is meeting its 
responsibilities as a universal broadband service provider. Back in 2018, the UK government introduced a 
"universal service obligation" law, allowing homes and businesses the right to request a "decent broadband 
connection". Regulator Office of Communications selected BT as the universal service provider. Under the law, 
customers with can request a broadband service with speeds of at least 10 megabits per second and upload 
speeds of at least one megabit per second. "Upon receiving such a request, BT must assess the costs of providing 
that connection and, where this is less than GBP3,400, BT must provide the connection. Where the assessed costs 
exceed that amount, BT must also provide the connection if the customer is willing to pay the excess costs," Ofcom 
explained. 
----------
Star Pubs & Bars, a UK chain owned by Dutch brewer Heineken, has been fined GBP2 million by the Pubs Code 
Adjudicator after investigators found serious and repeated breaches of the code over three years. The UK regulator 
found that where a pub tenant had asked to no longer be tied to Heineken, they were still made to sell 
"unreasonable levels" of Heineken beers and ciders. At one point 96 tenants who requested a free-of-tie option 
were told that 100% of the keg beer they sold had to be Heineken brands, the report added. It was also found that 
Star insisted that its own Code Compliance Officer must "ensure the code is interpreted to the commercial benefit of 
Heineken UK". A total of 12 breaches were identified and Pubs Code Adjudicator Fiona Dickie warned that other 
brewers could face similar actions.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were sharply lower with travel stocks among the worst performers after Ryanair cut its planned 
winter capacity. The pound was down against the dollar amid tougher restrictions in the UK. Wall Street was 
pointed to a lower open, with investment bank Morgan Stanley set to report earnings before the market open in 
New York.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Millions of people in England will face tougher coronavirus restrictions, with pubs expected to be ordered to shut in 
Greater Manchester and households banned from mixing indoors in London. Discussions are continuing between 
local leaders and the government over the extension of coronavirus controls, with Greater Manchester and 
Lancashire at risk of having the toughest Tier 3 restrictions which would involve closing pubs and bars unless they 
can operate as restaurants. MPs in the capital have been told that London will move to Tier 2 at midnight on Friday, 
meaning households will be banned from mixing indoors including pubs from Saturday. Ministers are holding a 
series of talks with MPs from the regions affected by the changes ahead of Health Secretary Matt Hancock giving a 
Commons update on the measures. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who has been resisting following 
the Liverpool City Region into Tier 3 restrictions, was to hold talks with No 10 as he demands greater financial 
support.
----------
All household visits are to be prohibited in Ireland in the effort to stem the spread of coronavirus. The Cabinet also 
agreed on Wednesday evening to raise restrictions in three border counties – Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan – to 
level four of the national framework. This will include limiting weddings to six, closing gyms, pools and leisure 
centres, closing of non essential retail and people being encouraged to work from home. They will come into force 
from midnight on Thursday to apply until November 10. Taoiseach Micheal Martin said the picture emerging in 
Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan is "very worrying". He said the national figure of cases per 100,000 in the last 14 
days was 190.7, but in Monaghan it was 360, in Donegal it was 353 and in Cavan it was 571.
----------
New cases of coronavirus infections in Germany have soared to 6,638 in the past 24 hours, official data showed 
Thursday, reaching a daily level not seen since the start of the pandemic. The alarming jump in numbers came just 
hours after Chancellor Angela Merkel met with the leaders of Germany's 16 federal states to agree tougher 
restrictions designed to slow the spread of the contagion. The highest number of new cases previously recorded in 
one day was 6,294, on March 28, according to figures from the Robert Koch Institute disease control centre.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening lower on Thursday amid concerns about the 
reimposition of coronavirus lockdowns and fading hopes of agreement on a new US stimulus package.
In early company news, Irish budget carrier Ryanair Holdings reduced its winter capacity as coronavirus restrictions 
plague the travel industry. Delivery chain Domino's Pizza said it was given a third-quarter boost from the UK 
government's value added tax cut and as more customers stayed home. Rothmans and Dunhill cigarette maker 
British American Tobacco named a new chair. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 29.06 points lower at 5,906.00. The blue-chip index closed down 
34.65 points, or 0.6%, at 5,935.06 on Wednesday.
Domino's Pizza said it saw a strong performance in the third quarter and expressed confidence in its full year 
outlook. 
For the 13 weeks to September 27, UK & Republic of Ireland system sales were up 19% to GBP342.1 million from 
GBP288.2 million at the same time last year. 
Domino's highlighted that the UK value added tax rate was slashed to 5% from 20% in July, and this helped 
franchisees mitigate costs and enabled savings to be passed onto customers. Since the rate change, VAT has 
boosted reported UK system sales and like-for-like growth, it said. 
The pizza chain reported an encouraging UK & ROI delivery performance, with order numbers up 12% and items 
per order and product mix both "encouraging".
Looking ahead, Domino's expects to report full year underlying pretax profit in the range of GBP93 million to GBP98 
million, in line with market consensus. The company reported an underlying pretax profit of GBP98.8 million for 
financial 2019.

"We saw a benefit from staycations and the return of live sport on television during the period, although we also 
saw a headwind as competitors reopened following the national lockdown and, in September, we saw weaker 
demand in university areas. We were pleased to reopen our collection business, and collection orders were around 
60% of the prior year level. We do not expect our collection business to fully recover to prior levels until normal 
consumer behaviour returns," Domino's added.
Ryanair Holdings said forward bookings have "materially" weakened in November and December due to increased 
flight restrictions imposed by EU governments. It will close its bases in Cork and Shannon in Ireland and in 
Toulouse in France this winter as Covid-19 continues to hurt the travel sector.
In light of the weaker bookings, the Irish carrier further reduced its winter schedule, from November to March - 
taking capacity down to 40% from 60% of prior year.
Ryanair said with the greatly reduced winter capacity and load factors of around 70%, it now expects full year traffic 
to fall to 38 million passengers. The airline said this guidance could be further revised downwards if EU government 
continue to "mismanage air travel and impose more lockdowns this winter". 
"It is inevitable, given the scale of these cutbacks, that we will be implementing more unpaid leave, and job sharing 
this winter in those bases where we have agreed reduced working time and pay, but this is a better short-term 
outcome than mass job losses. There will regrettably be more redundancies at those small number of cabin crew 
bases where we have still not secured agreement on working time and pay cuts, which is the only alternative," said 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary. 
British American Tobacco said Non-Executive Director Luc Jobin will succeed Richard Burrows as chair at the 
conclusion of the company's annual general meeting in April. Jobin will be appointed as chair-designate in March. 
Jobin served as CEO of Canadian National Railway Co and of Imperial Tobacco Canada.
Schroders said assets under management as at September 30 was GBP536.3 billion, up 2.0% from GBP525.8 
billion on July 1. 
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday said that, despite some progress, he still has not reached 
an agreement with Democratic lawmakers on a new stimulus package for the US economy.
"We continue to make progress on certain issues, on certain issues we continue to be far apart," Mnuchin said 
during a virtual appearance at an economics conference.
The two sides are unable to agree on how much to spend, or what form to spend it in, with Democrats demanding 
aid for struggling state and local governments that are at the front line of delivering aid.
Elsewhere, France on Wednesday became the latest European country to toughen anti-coronavirus measures, 
imposing a curfew in Paris and eight other cities from Saturday, while Germany and Ireland also ramped up 
restrictions.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also under increasing pressure to impose more stringent measures to cut 
spiralling infection rates in England, including a two-week "circuit-breaker" lockdown.
"With the prospect of an imminent US stimulus plan diminishing by the day, rising infection rates prompting tighter 
restrictions across Europe, and little prospect of a vaccine before the middle of next year, is it any wonder that 
investors are starting to get a little twitchy, with European markets set to open lower this morning," said CMC 
Markets analyst Michael Hewson.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3021 early Thursday, flat from USD1.3029 at the London equities close on 
Wednesday.
Meanwhile, EU leaders are to take stock of the talks with the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal amid "frustration" in 
London at the slow progress.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said Covid-19 travel restrictions across Europe and the UK led to 
a 64% year-on-year drop in September traffic and a significant reduction in its flying schedule.
The Irish budget airline carried just 5.1 million passengers in September, down 64% from 14.1 million a year ago. 
On a rolling annual basis, September passenger numbers were down 47% to 79.9 million.
Ryanair operated 53% of its normal September schedule with a 71% load factor.
Airlines around the world have been hammered by the Covid-19 pandemic, with carriers forced to cut jobs and flight 
operations amid travel restriction and sharply reduced demand.
Earlier in September, Ryanair had slashed its October capacity by a further 20%, on top of the 20% cut that was 
already announced previously. The capacity reduction was blamed upon frequent changes in government travel 
restrictions and policies. 
On Thursday, Turkey and Poland were removed by the UK government from the quarantine exemption, leaving few 
holiday destinations on the list of air bridges.
Ryanair predicted its capacity for October will fall to 40% of levels seen the same month the year before from 50%. 
It expects to maintain a load factor of more than 70%.
In a effort to win back customers, Ryanair launched a  "buy one, get one free" offer in September. 
Customers who book a flight before midnight on September 24 for travel up to December 14 on selected routes will 
get a second ticket at no extra charge, the company had announced.
Shares in Ryanair were down 1.0% at EUR11.44 each in London on Friday morning. Year-to-date the stock is down 
22%.

Ryanair Loses Court Action Against Irish State's Travel Restrictions

(Alliance News) - The High Court has ruled against Ryanair Holdings PLC's legal action challenging the Irish 
government's Covid-19 travel restrictions.
The airline had challenged the legality of travel advice published by the Irish government in the wake of the 
coronavirus pandemic.
In its action, Ryanair claimed the travel restrictions aimed at limiting the spread of the virus were "unlawful" and 
amounted to a disproportionate interference in the rights of the airline and its passengers.
The Irish government disputed those claims.
On Friday, Justice Garrett Simons ruled that the government had "acted lawfully" in providing travel advice and 
public health advice in respect of the coronavirus pandemic on a non-statutory basis.
"The government is entitled, in the exercise of the executive power, to provide such advice to the public," the 
judgment read.
Ryanair claimed the restrictions were unconstitutional and it sought various orders and declarations, including an 
order setting aside the measures announced in late July.
These included that people should not travel outside the island of Ireland, except for essential purposes, and that 
everyone should holiday at home in 2020.
Ryanair maintained that what had been published by the government went "well beyond mere travel advice" and 
represented the "imposition of restrictions on international travel".
Judge Simons rejected the argument.
Ryanair Loses Court Action Against Irish State's Travel Restrictions
"Ryanair's principal complaint is that, as a matter of domestic constitutional law, the government, in publishing the 
impugned travel advice, exceeded its executive powers and trespassed upon the legislative power," he said.
"These arguments have been rejected."
Under the current public health guidelines, any person entering the Irish State is advised to restrict their movements 
for a period of 14 days.
This advice does not apply to travellers entering the Irish State from a small number of countries identified on the 
so-called "green list".
In its ruling, the High Court said the information published on the government's official websites presented an 
"accurate portrayal" of the legal status of the travel advice and public health advice.
"The advice to avoid non-essential travel and to restrict movements on entry to the State is just that: advice," the 
ruling read.
"The government merely requests that persons entering the State from a country not on the 'green list' restrict their 
movements for 14 days. As of August 2020, there had been no legal requirement to do so."

LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: AstraZeneca 's Farxiga Gets US Breakthrough Tag

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening lower on Friday after US President Donald Trump said 
he has tested positive for the coronavirus and as fears over the failure to reach a US stimulus agreement mounted.
In early company news, British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group announced the results of 
its capital increase. Ryanair reported continued depressed flying activity in September. Drugmaker AstraZeneca 
said its Farxiga drug was granted breakthrough therapy designation in the US. Magazine publisher Future went 
shopping in the US, while asset manager Liontrust Asset Management made a disposal. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 82.45 points lower at 5,797.10. The blue-chip index closed up 
13.35 points, or 0.2%, at 5,879.45 on Thursday.
In a tweet overnight, Trump said that he and his wife Melania tested positive for Covid-19 and that they will now 
quarantine themselves. The news came after it was announced on Thursday that senior Trump aide Hope Hicks 
had tested positive.
The development comes a month before the US election on November 3. Trump is now expected to be in 
quarantine for some two weeks while facing treatment for the disease. The president is 74 years old, putting him at 
a higher risk of serious complications from the virus.
Still, the Associated Press quoted an unidentified White House doctor as saying Trump would continue carrying out 
his duties "without disruption" despite the diagnosis.
Future said it has acquired US-based digital entertainment publisher CinemaBlend for an undisclosed sum. The UK 
magazine publisher said the move was intended to expand its reach of 46 million online users in its TV & film and 
games & entertainment categories, particularly in the US.

Liontrust Asset Management said it is to sell its Asia Income investment team to Somerset Capital for a total of up 
to GBP2 million in cash. Completion is expected to take place in the first quarter of 2021.
"After consideration and discussions with Somerset and the Asia Income Team, the directors of the company 
decided that the sale to Somerset, a specialist emerging markets and Asian equities fund management business, is 
in the best interests of the investors in the fund, the Asia Income team and Liontrust shareholders. This review has 
also led to Liontrust deciding to close the European Income and Macro Thematic investment teams," the company 
said. 
IAG said it has received 100% acceptances for the new shares to be issued under the company's EUR2.74 billion 
equity capital raise.
The Anglo-Spanish airline group earlier in September had said it would issue 2.98 billion shares at EUR0.92 each 
to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce leverage. Qatar Airways, IAG's largest shareholder with a 25% stake, 
had irrevocably undertaken to subscribe for its pro-rata entitlement under the capital increase. IAG on Friday said it 
has received acceptances in respect of all 2.98 billion shares to be issued under the fundraise.
AstraZeneca said its Farxiga drug has been granted breakthrough therapy designation in the US for patients with 
chronic kidney disease, with and without type-2 diabetes.
The US Food & Drug Administration assigns breakthrough therapy designation to candidates that address a 
significant unmet medical need and which show encouraging early clinical results.
"Following the ground-breaking DAPA-CKD results, the Breakthrough Therapy Designation is further testament to 
Farxiga's potential to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. We look forward to working with the Food & 
Drug Administration to make Farxiga available to patients as quickly as possible," said Mene Pangalos, executive 
vice president of Astra's BioPharmaceuticals R&D unit.
Ryanair Holding said September traffic was down 64% to 5.1 million passengers from 14.1 million at the same time 
last year, as Covid-19 restrictions continued to hurt air travel. The Irish carrier said it operated around 53% of its 
normal September schedule with a 71% load factor. 
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index ended down 0.7% following an outage on Thursday which halted trading. 
Financial markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong remain closed for the Golden Week holidays.
In the US, expectations dwindled that lawmakers will have time to pass a new stimulus package before the 
presidential election.
Democrats pushed their latest USD2.2 trillion proposal through the House, where they hold a majority, but without 
any opposition support, there is no chance it will be agreed by the Republican-dominated Senate.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held a series of talks Thursday to find a way 
through the deadlock but when asked whether a chance still remained for an agreement, Pelosi replied: "I don't 
know."
Oanda Markets analyst Jeffery Halley said: "Having built hopes higher steadily over the past few sessions that the 
US Republicans and Democrats were edging closer to a new fiscal stimulus package, a sense of deja vu has swept 
markets this morning. By my reckoning, the stimulus spread was at USD1.6 trillion to USD2.2 trillion as of 
yesterday, far apart, but less insurmountable then previous weeks. Sadly, it appears there is no sign that either side 
is prepared to cross the spread, or even meet in the middle ahead of a soft Thursday deadline US time."
The pound was quoted at USD1.2860 Friday morning, lower from USD1.2889 at the London equities close 
Thursday.
The euro stood at USD1.1715, down from USD1.1745 at the European equities close Thursday. Against the yen, 
the dollar was trading at JPY105.25, down from JPY105.58.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
AstraZeneca said it has resumed its phase 2/3 clinical trial of Covid-19 vaccine AZD1222 in Japan after talks with 
the Japanese Pharmaceuticals & Medical Devices Agency. The FTSE 100-listed pharmaceutical firm said a 
standard review process triggered a voluntary pause to vaccination across all global trials on September 6 so that 
an independent committee could review safety data. Trials were paused in September after a UK volunteer 
developed an unexplained illness. Astra had already restarted its trials in the UK, as well as in Brazil, South Africa 
and India. However, trials in the US have yet to resume, and Astra is still working with the US Food & Drug 
Administration "to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US 
trial", it said.
----------
British Airways-parent International Consolidated Airlines said it has received 100% acceptances for the new 
shares to be issued under the company's EUR2.74 billion equity capital raise. The Anglo-Spanish airline earlier in 
September had said it would issue 2.98 billion shares at EUR0.92 each to strengthen its balance sheet and reduce 
leverage. Qatar Airways, IAG's largest shareholder with a 25% stake, had irrevocably undertaken to subscribe for 
its pro-rata entitlement under the capital increase. IAG on Friday said it has received acceptances in respect of all 
2.98 billion shares to be issued under the fundraise.

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: US President Trump Tests Positive For Covid-19
Ryanair said Covid-19 travel restrictions across Europe and the UK led to a 64% year-on-year drop in September 
traffic and a significant reduction in its flying schedule. The Irish budget airline carried just 5.1 million passengers in 
September, down 64% from 14.1 million a year ago. On a rolling annual basis, September passenger numbers 
were down 47% to 79.9 million. Ryanair operated 53% of its normal September schedule with a 71% load factor. 
Airlines around the world have been hammered by the Covid-19 pandemic, with carriers forced to cut jobs and flight 
operations amid travel restriction and sharply reduced demand.
----------
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who are advising Rolls-Royce Holdings on its GBP5 billion debt and equity 
issue plans, have cut their underwriting exposure to the fundraising due to the Covid-19 led market volatility and the 
US presidential elections, the Financial Times reported, citing several sources. Rolls-Royce on Thursday had 
outlined plans for a balance sheet boosting GBP2 billion rights issue, a GBP1 billion bond offering and the 
possibility of GBP2 billion more in loans. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, along with Rolls-Royce's house 
broker Jefferies, had originally committed to underwrite 60% of the 6.4 billion new Rolls-Royce shares to be issued 
in the 10-for-three cash call. The total commitment is now closer to 30%, the newspaper reported.
----------
Centamin said it will defer open pit mining operations in the Stage 4 West wall of the open pit at its Sukari gold mine 
in Egypt after detecting movement in a localised area of waste material. The decision to defer operations in that 
zone is a preventative measure, aiming to ensure workforce health and safety, Centamin said. As a result of the 
deferral, however, its 2020 guidance will be reduced, and it will include an updated mine plan for future years in its 
life of asset review. For the three month ended September 30, preliminary gold production was around 120,000 
ounces, taking nine-month production to about 375,000 ounces. Centamin's preliminary estimate is that fourth 
quarter production will be reduced to around 70,000 ounces.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were lower after US President Donald Trump said he tested positive for the coronavirus. Rolls-
Royce was the worst performer, down 8.5%. The pound was up against the dollar after UK Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson will speak to the president of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen over Brexit on Saturday. US stock 
market futures were pointed sharply lower.

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: US President Trump Tests Positive For Covid-19
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
US President Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19, upending the already tense US election, but was 
described by his doctor on Friday as feeling "well" and able to perform his duties while quarantining. Trump, 74, first 
announced on Twitter that he and First Lady Melania Trump, 50, had tested positive for the virus. The extraordinary 
setback for Trump had immediate political consequences just 31 days before election day, forcing him to cancel 
campaign trips and adding new volatility to a contest already steeped in tension, AFP reports. Trump's challenger, 
Democrat Joe Biden, is well ahead in the polls and has made criticism of the Republican's handling of the 
coronavirus - and frequent downplaying of the pandemic's seriousness. Trump, in response, has been betting on an 
evermore aggressive schedule of campaign rallies around the country. The events, which he says prove his true 
political strength, bring together thousands of people, often without masks and sometimes in contravention of local 
rules. That strategy is now in doubt, with the White House immediately cancelling a planned campaign rally in the 
crucial swing state of Florida later Friday.
----------
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to hold talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to 
take stock of negotiations on a post-Brexit free trade deal, Downing Street has said. The two leaders will speak on 
Saturday to discuss the "next steps" following the conclusion of the final formal round of talks in Brussels. The chief 
negotiators Michel Barnier and Lord Frost were meeting on Friday in the Belgian capital at the end of a week of 
talks. A No 10 spokesman said: "The prime minister will be speaking to President von der Leyen tomorrow 
afternoon to take stock of negotiations and discuss next steps." Both sides have acknowledged that time is running 
out if they are to achieve an agreement before the current Brexit transition period comes to an end at the end of the 
year.
----------
Johnson faces mounting unease from his Conservative rank and file over the coronavirus pandemic as the party 
opens its annual conference on Saturday in a quieter virtual format, PA reports. Instead of the usual tub-thumping 
speeches in cavernous halls and crowded drinks gatherings, the party faithful will follow proceedings online, 
depriving Johnson of a chance to deliver one of his barnstorming turns. But that may be a blessing in disguise, with 
polls suggesting he is increasingly becoming the target of public disquiet over the government's handling of the 
coronavirus pandemic, as a second wave worsens what is already the highest death toll in Europe.
----------
Almost half of UK firms have suffered a fall in sales in recent months as business conditions remain "fragile", 
according to a new report. The British Chambers of Commerce said companies were enduring a sustained "cash 
crunch" amid the ongoing virus crisis. A survey of 6,410 firms, employing more than 580,000 people across the UK, 
found that cash flow in the services sector remained at levels comparable to the recession a decade ago. Business 
to consumer firms, including hospitality, were faring the worst, said the BCC.
----------
New local lockdowns will be imposed in the north of England as travellers arriving from Turkey and Poland are to be 
told to enter quarantine to combat a resurgence in coronavirus. More than a third of the UK will be under 
heightened restrictions when Liverpool, Warrington, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough enter local lockdowns on 
Saturday. Holidaymakers began cancelling their plans after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced on 
Thursday that more countries will be removed from the quarantine exemption list. Those returning from Turkey, 
Poland and the Caribbean islands of Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba will have to isolate for 14 days if they arrive 
after 4am on Saturday.

(Alliance News) - Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Friday said it will operate just 50% of last year's capacity in October in 
light of ongoing government-led travel restrictions as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and a subsequent drop in 
demand for travel during the winter period.
The FTSE 250-listed European airline also warned that it will not to operate at a higher level of capacity during 
winter months than its projection for October should the virus restrictions remain at current levels.
"The protection of its solid balance sheet and excellent liquidity position as well as minimising cost across all areas 
of the business remain Wizz Air's top priority. While conditions continue to be challenging, the relentless focus on 
creating a competitive advantage and strong liquidity will allow Wizz Air to emerge from this crisis as a structural 
winner," the Budapest, Hungary-based company noted.
Earlier in September, rival Ryanair Holdings PLC also cut its capacity for October beyond a reduction already 
announced in mid-August.
The Irish low-cost carrier last week said that it will slash its October capacity by 20%, on top of the 20% cut that was 
announced earlier. The capacity reduction was also blamed upon changes in government travel restrictions and 
policies.
Ryanair predicted its capacity for October would fall to 40% of levels seen the same month the year before from 
50%. It expects to maintain a load factor of more than 70%.

Stena Drilling has nominated the Stena IceMAX as the intended drill rig for the Perseverance No 1 well drilling 
campaign. The rig is expected to arrive on site by December 15, and the well will be spudded after three to four

Boohoo, up 9.7%. The online clothing retailer laid out a series of changes it plans to make after an independent 
review found "significant and clearly unacceptable issues" in its supply chain. The review was launched by Boohoo 
in July following claims it sold clothes made in factories where staff were paid less than the minimum wage. The 
review identified "many failings" in the Leicester supply chain and recommended improvements to Boohoo's 
corporate governance, compliance and monitoring processes. Alison Levitt, who was appointed to run the review, 
was satisfied that Boohoo did not deliberately allow poor conditions and low pay to exist within its supply chain, 
however. Following the review and its recommendations, Boohoo said it will enhance corporate governance and

all-share deal that values the London-based wastewater firm at around GBP21.3 million. The acquisition deal will 
see every 10 existing Integumen shares consolidated into 1 new Integumen share. After the consolidation, Modern 
Water shareholders will receive 1 new Integumen share for each 10 Modern Water shares. The merged company 
will be renamed DeepVerge. Under Rule 24.1 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the offer document - 
which contains further information about the offer and the form of acceptance - are required to be published within 
28 days of the firm intention to make an offer, which in this case, sets the deadline to Friday today. However, with 
the agreement of Modern Water directors, Integumen has sought and been granted approval to extend the date to

Water firm Pennon Group said it expects the Covid-19 pandemic to hurt revenue for the current financial year to the 
tune of GBP10 million as it noted progress on its debt restructuring programme. Pennon stated that while revenue 
from household water usage went up, this was offset by a large reduction in water usage from businesses and 
commercial customers. It added that its Business-to-Business retailer Pennon Water Services has continued to 
work to minimise bad debt risk through the implementation of cash collection initiatives, highlighting that cash 
collections across the group has remained "robust". Pennon said South West Water remains on track to deliver 
continued return-on-regulated-equity outperformance, driven by efficient financing and total expenditure as it added 
that delivery of the unit's GBP1 billion investment programme to 2025 to improve services for customers, protect 
and enhance the environment, and strengthen resilience is underway.

Shaftesbury said that footfall in London's West End has started to recover in the real estate investment trust's 
second half to date, however due to a recent rise in virus cases, it has decided to not declare a final dividend. For 
the fourth quarter ending September 30, the property investor noted a slow recovery in footfall in the West End 
starting from July, following the area's effective closure in February. The recovery was particularly noticeable in 
major shopping streets Oxford Street and Regent Street, as well was leisure-focused Leicester Square and Soho. 
The improvement was attributed to a return of local and domestic day visitors, and a gradual return of office-based 
workers. In addition, most of Shaftesbury's 611 restaurants, cafes, pubs and shops have reopened since late June. 
For the six months to September 30, 41% of rent due has been collected, while 10% is expected to be subject to 
deferred collection arrangements. West End-focused investor Shaftesbury said 23% is being waived and 26% 
remains outstanding.

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Government Borrowing Surges In August
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK government borrowing in August was the third highest of any month on record due to the Covid-19 crisis, figures 
from the Office for National Statistics showed. Public sector net borrowing, excluding public sector banks, is 
estimated to have been GBP35.9 billion in August, up by GBP30.5 billion on a year ago and the third highest 
borrowing in any month since records began in 1993. Central government bodies are estimated to have spent 
GBP78.5 billion on day-to-day activities in August, being GBP19.5 billion more than in August 2019. This figure 
includes GBP6.1 billion on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and GBP4.7 billion in Self Employment Income 
Support Scheme payments. The Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which ran through August offering diners up to 
GBP10 off a meal, cost the government GBP500 million. Borrowing in the first five months of this financial year - 
April to August - is estimated to have been GBP173.7 billion. This is GBP146.9 billion more than in the same period 
last year and the highest borrowing in any April to August period since records began.
----------
UK consumer confidence continued to gradually improve for the fourth consecutive month, but remained well below 
pre-pandemic levels, data from the Gfk Consumer Confidence index showed. The overall index score came in at 
minus 25 for September, an improvement from minus 27 in August. In July, the index score was also minus 27, 
narrowed from minus 30 in June and minus 34 in May. The figure was still down from minus 12 for September 
2019. Among the index components, the General Economic Situation over the last 12 months reading increased by 
one point to minus 61 in September from minus 62 in August, but is still lower than minus 32 for September 2019. 
The General Economic Situation over the next 12 months rose by four points to minus 38 points from minus 42 in 
August. The figure was still down from minus 35 in September 2019.
----------
A coronavirus contact tracing app has launched across England and Wales at what the Health Secretary has called 
"a tipping point" in the fight against coronavirus. The rollout follows months of delay and questions about its 
effectiveness in the face of mixed results from other countries which have already deployed such apps. As of 
Thursday evening, the app had been downloaded more than one million times by Android users, according to the 
Google Play Store. The total figure is likely to be higher when iPhone downloads are included, but Apple does not 
provide similar figures for app downloads. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland have already introduced their own 
individual contact tracing apps, which users can switch to should they visit either country, following the delay of the 
original NHS software. NHS Test & Trace, which is responsible for the service, said the app was used to send alerts 
to users during a trial period on the Isle of Wight and in the London borough of Newham, after people had tested 
positive.
----------
Eurozone money supply growth weakened in August, while household credit extension growth remained steady, 
data from the European Central Bank showed. M3 money supply growth slowed to 9.5% in August on an annual 
basis, compared to the downwardly revised 10.1% reported growth in July. According to FXStreet, economist 
consensus was for M3 money supply growth to be 10.2% in August, unchanged from the initial reading for July. The 
ECB also reported that growth in loans to households stood at 3.0%, unchanged from the previous months.
----------
Chinese government debt is set to be included on a key global bonds index, which could see tens of billions of 
dollars of foreign investment in the country's increasingly internationalised financial markets. The move by FTSE 
Russell comes as trading in China becomes an increasingly controversial move in Washington as relations between 
the superpowers grow increasingly fraught. But analysts said the attraction of higher yields – the yield on 10-year 
Chinese government bonds is 2.4 percentage points higher than US Treasuries – and a relatively stable currency 
have made the country an attractive prospect for investors. Inclusion in the FTSE World Government Bond index,

which could begin next October if approved, means CGBs will be a must-have asset for investment giants such as 
pension funds desperate for good returns as the global bond market is battered by the virus pandemic.

(Alliance News) - Four low-cost airlines, including Ryanair Holdings PLC, are facing an antitrust investigation in Italy 
for failing to reimburse flights cancelled on account of the coronavirus pandemic.
The carriers offered vouchers rather than full refunds, in a "possible breach" of EU regulations on air passengers' 
rights, Italian competition authority AGCM said in a statement on Friday.
easyJet PLC, Blue Panorama and Vueling - a Spanish carrier owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group 
SA - are the three other airlines targeted by AGCM's investigation.
The authority noted that even though the pandemic was given as the reason for cancellations, the flights in question 
were scheduled for after the end of Italy's lockdown period.
The airlines were also accused of failing to inform customers about their cancellation rights, and providing "onerous 
and poor" customer service via an expensive and "hard-to-reach" phone helpline.
ACGM said it launched similar investigations in July against two other airlines, Alitalia and Volotea.

(Alliance News) - International travel has plummeted during the pandemic, with nowhere worse affected than the 
Asia-Pacific region, data released by the United Nations tourism body showed on Thursday.
International tourist arrivals across the region dropped 72% in 2020, according to data compiled by the World 
Tourism Organization, the worst decline seen around the world.
In the month of June, international tourist arrivals to the region plummeted 99% year-on-year in the wake of 
pandemic era travel bans, UNWTO's new Tourism Recovery Tracker shows.
China, Japan and South Korea were worst hit by the drop in global travel, with North-East Asia seeing an 83% drop 
in tourist arrivals as most countries prohibited all but essential travel.
South-East Asia, where countries remain largely closed to foreign tourists -  and some, such as Malaysia, have 
effectively barred citizens from leaving - saw arrivals fall by 64%. 
Around % of Malaysia's 2019 gross domestic product was derived from international tourism. In neighbouring 
Thailand, that figure usually tops 10%, whereas Cambodia's is nearer to 20.
Europe ranks as the second-worst hit region on the UNWTO tracker, registering a 66% decline in arrivals despite 
an uptick after many restrictions were eased in June.
The UNWTO last month slammed governments for "timid" efforts to revive tourism despite worldwide losses 
estimated at USD460 billion - equivalent to Austria's GDP - in the period to June alone.
Airlines have echoed UNWTO criticisms, with Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest carrier, last week saying 
pandemic-related travel rules had forced it to cut capacity by 20% for the second time in two months.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair has launched the first "buy one, get one free" offer in the airline's 35-year history as it 
attempts to increase flagging passenger numbers.
Customers who book a flight before midnight on Thursday for travel up to December 14 on selected routes will get a 
second ticket at no extra charge.
This comes days after the airline announced it will further reduce its operations due to coronavirus travel 
restrictions.
Its capacity in October will be 40% of 2019 levels, compared with the 50% it previously announced.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said demand for future bookings is "terrible".
He told Sky News: "Into November and December our forward bookings are running at around 10%, that's about a 
quarter of where they would normally be at this time of the year.
"We can't rule out job losses but in Ryanair we're certainly desperately working with our people to prevent them."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it will cut its capacity for October beyond the reduction 
already announced in mid-August.
The Irish low-cost carrier said that it will slash its October capacity by 20%, on top of the 20% cut that was 
announced earlier.
The capacity reduction was blamed on the damage caused to forward bookings by changes in EU government 
travel restrictions and policies, most of which Ryanair considers being introduced at short notice, undermining the 
willingness to make forward bookings.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it now expects its capacity for October to fall to 40% of levels seen the same month 
the year before from 50%, but it still expects to maintain a load factor of more than 70%.
Ryanair argued that in some countries - meaning the UK and Ireland - where "excessive and defective" travel 
restrictions have been in place since July 1, Covid-19 rates have risen in recent weeks to 50 per 100,000, more 
than Germany or Italy, where intra-EU air travel has been freely allowed.
"We are disappointed to reduce our October capacity from 50% of 2019 to 40%. However, as customer confidence 
is damaged by government mismanagement of Covid travel policies, many Ryanair customers are unable to travel 
for business or urgent family reasons without being subjected to defective 14 day quarantines," Ryanair 
complained.
"While it is too early yet to make final decisions on our winter schedule (from Nov to Mar), if current trends and EU 
governments' mismanagement of the return of air travel and normal economic activity continue, then similar 
capacity cuts may be required across the winter period," the airline added.
Shares in Ryanair were down 4.1% at EUR12.05 on Friday in London.

London Stock Exchange Group confirmed that it has entered into exclusive discussions with peer Euronext over the 
sale of Borsa Italiana, the operator of the Milan stock exchange. "There can be no certainty that a transaction will 
result from these discussions and any potential sale will be dependent upon the outcome of the European 
Commission's review of the Refinitiv transaction and that transaction closing in accordance with its terms," the stock 
exchange operator cautioned, however. In a short statement, LSEG also said that it had received and reviewed a 
number of competitive proposals from several parties for each of MTS and the Borsa Italiana group as a whole, but

AstraZeneca said updated results from its Pacific phase 3 trial of Imfinzi showed a sustained and clinically 
meaningful improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival in lung cancer. The trial was of patients 
with unresectable, stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer who had not progressed after concurrent chemoradiation 
therapy. One in three patients with non-small cell lung cancer are diagnosed at stage 3, at which point most 
tumours are unresectable - meaning they cannot be removed with surgery. Before Imfinzi in this setting, there have 
been no new treatments past chemoradiation therapy in decades. Results from the updated post-hoc analyses 
showed an estimated four-year survival rate with Imfinzi of 50% compared to 36% with placebo after 
chemoradiation therapy. Median overall survival was 47.5 months for Imfinzi and 29.1 months with placebo. At the 
maximum treatment course of one year, around 35% of patients treated with the drug had not progressed four 
years after enrolment compared to 20% with placebo.

Amid a looming deadline set by US President Donald Trump, negotiators scrambled to find a new ownership 
structure for the popular video app TikTok that would pass muster in both the US and China. A deal appeared to be 
taking shape this week that would allow Silicon Valley-based Oracle to be the US technology partner for TikTok to 
allay Washington's concerns that the platform could be used for Chinese espionage. But details of the deal 
remained unclear. Some reports said Oracle would be a minority stakeholder in TikTok, with the Chinese parent 
firm ByteDance keeping a majority. A US government national security panel was reviewing the Oracle Corp bid 
while Republican lawmakers warned against accepting a deal that keeps the Chinese firm in control. "We'll make a 
decision soon," Trump said Thursday, a day after saying he was undecided and still considering the national 
security implications of any new structure for the wildly popular app, which has an estimated 100 million users in the 
US and as many as one billion worldwide.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
A second national lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus has not been ruled out but the "great hope" is that 
people will heed current advice to help manage a "very serious" situation, the UK Health Secretary has said. Matt 
Hancock said a national lockdown was the "last line of defence" as he responded to reports that ministers are 
considering further national measures, even for just a two-week period, such as imposing a curfew on bars and 
restaurants. It comes as the UK government comes under fire over the NHS Test & Trace system, which has seen 
up to four times the number of people trying to book a test as the number of tests available. Hancock told BBC 
Breakfast the latest data showed that hospital admissions are now doubling every eight days, amid warnings that 
deaths will rise in the coming weeks. Scientists from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies 
have reportedly proposed a two-week national lockdown in October to tackle the rising number of Covid-19 cases. 
The Financial Times reported that they had said a lockdown could coincide with the October school half-term.
----------
UK retail sales registered their fourth straight month of growth in August, but the pace of improvement is slowing, 
the Office for National Statistics showed. Sales were up 0.8% month-on-month in August, slower than the 3.7% 
growth posted for July but ahead of expectations, according to FXStreet, of 0.7%. The strength of the retail rebound 
has been fading since lockdown measures began to be eased, with sales having risen 12% in May and 14% in 
June. Annually, sales grew 2.8% in August, accelerating from a rise of 1.4% in July. The ONS said sales in August 
were up 4.0% compared to February's pre-pandemic level. The statistical body noted that there was a "mixed 
picture" across store types in August, with non-store - such as online - retailing volumes 39% above February, while 
clothing stores were 16% below pre-pandemic levels.
----------
German producer prices of industrial products remained stable in August compared to July, but dropped on the 
prior year, figures from Destatis showed. In August, the index of producer prices for industrial products decreased 
by 1.2% compared with the same month a year ago. In July, producer prices fell by 1.7% year-on-year, as reported 
by the Federal Statistical Office. When compared with July, the index remained unchanged in August after a 0.2% 
increase month-on-month in July from June. Energy prices declined by 3.9% in August from a year before. Also on 
an annual basis, prices of petroleum products were down 14%, while prices of natural gas decreased by 9.9%. 
Prices of non-durable consumer goods increased by 0.3% compared to August 2019.
----------
The European Commission president has said she is "convinced" a trade deal remains possible with the UK but 
called Boris Johnson's attempt to override the Brexit treaty an "unpleasant surprise". Ursula von der Leyen, in 
comments made to reporters on Thursday, said Downing Street's controversial UK Internal Market Bill had 
"distracted very strongly" from the two sides being able to secure fresh trade terms before the looming deadline. 
The post-Brexit transition period, during which relations between the EU and the UK have remained static, is due to 
end after December 31 and leaders on both sides of the Channel have warned that an agreement is needed by 
October if a deal is to be ratified in time for the start of 2021. With the cliff edge only a month away, the prime 
minister has faced criticism domestically and on the world stage for pursuing legislation that would defy the 
Withdrawal Agreement brokered with the EU last year, breaking international law in the process. Johnson was 
forced on Wednesday to agree to table an amendment to the Internal Market Bill, giving MPs a vote before the 
government can use the powers related to Northern Ireland which would breach the treaty.

Fear

(Alliance News) - London stock prices remained in the red on Friday at a midday, amid gathering concern over a 
possible UK-wide lockdown next month. 
This hit travel firms, with the shares of airlines and hotel owners lower on the prospect of a lockdown spanning the 
October half-term school holiday.
The FTSE 100 index was off 13.15 points, or 0.2%, at 6,036.77 midday Friday. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was 
down 154.95 points, or 0.9%, at 17,582.77. The AIM All-Share index was down 0.1% at 969.04.
The Cboe UK 100 index was down 0.4% at 600.87. The Cboe 250 was 1.2% lower at 14,972.96 and the Cboe 
Small Companies down 0.5% at 9,393.10.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.3%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.1% early Friday 
afternoon.
"With a whirlwind of political, economic, and healthcare activity creating a volatile backdrop, investors took time on 
Friday to take stock of events. Markets were relatively calm with the FTSE 100 trading 0.2% lower at 6,036, similar 
to movements in many parts of mainland Europe, but small gains seen across Asia," said Russ Mould, investment 
director at AJ Bell.
"Amid growing chatter about a potential two-week nationwide lockdown in October in the UK, it was perhaps no 
surprise to see investors lose interest in stocks that could be negatively affected by such activity," Mould added. "It 
would dash any hopes of a half-term getaway."
A second national lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus has not been ruled out but the "great hope" is that 
people will heed current advice to help manage a "very serious" situation, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.

A national lockdown was the "last line of defence", Hancock said, as he responded to reports that ministers are

Scientists from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies have reportedly proposed a two-week 
national lockdown in October to tackle the rising number of Covid-19 cases. The Financial Times reported that they 
had said a lockdown could coincide with the October school half-term.
Earlier this week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the potential impact of a second national lockdown on 
the economy as "disastrous".
Amid the speculation, travel stocks were the worst performers in London on Friday. British Airways-parent 
International Consolidated Airlines was down 11%, while Holiday Inn-owner Intercontinental Hotels was down 6.3% 
and budget airline easyJet down 9.0%.
Ryanair was down 5.5% after saying it will cut its capacity for October beyond the reduction already announced in 
mid-August.
The Irish low-cost carrier said that it will slash its October capacity by 20%, on top of the 20% cut that was 
announced earlier.
The capacity reduction was blamed on the damage caused to forward bookings by changes in EU government 
travel restrictions and policies, most of which Ryanair considers being introduced at short notice, undermining the 
willingness to make forward bookings.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it now expects its capacity for October to fall to 40% of levels seen the same month 
the year before from 50%, but it still expects to maintain a load factor of more than 70%.
Wall Street is on course for a mixed start, with the Dow Industrials seen down 0.5%, the S&P 500 flat and the 
Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%.
The dollar was lower on Friday.
The euro traded at USD1.1845, higher than USD1.1821 late Thursday in London. Against the yen, the dollar was 
lower at JPY104.35 versus JPY104.79.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.2990 Friday midday, up on USD1.2955 at the London equities close on Thursday.
UK retail sales registered their fourth straight month of growth in August, but the pace of improvement is slowing, 
data from the Office for National Statistics showed.
Sales were up 0.8% month-on-month in August, slower than the 3.7% growth posted for July but ahead of

measures began to be eased, with sales having risen 12% in May and 14% in June.
Back in London, gold miner Fresnillo was up 4.1%, tracking the price of the precious metal higher. 
Gold was quoted at USD1,953.90 an ounce at midday, up from USD1,946.60 on Thursday. Brent oil was trading at 
USD43.76 a barrel, up from USD43.22 late Thursday in London.
At the top of the FTSE 250 was John Laing, up 5.7% after agreeing to sell its entire 30% stake in a UK rail 
programme for up to GBP421 million in cash.
The mid-cap infrastructure investor has entered into an agreement to sell its 30% interest in the InterCity Express 
Programme Phase 2 to AIP Management, a Danish investment company. The sale consideration represents a 
strong uplift on the GBP333 million valuation of the stake as at June 30, John Laing noted.

John Laing said it will return 5% to 10% of gross proceeds from the sale to investors on an annual basis, as per the 
company's dividend policy.
Essentra fell 8.3% after raising GBP100 million through a share sale, the money from which will go towards the 
acquisition of North Carolina-based 3C! Packaging, which provides packaging and labels with a pharmaceutical 
focus.
The FTSE 250 plastics and fibre products maker issued a total of 38.5 million shares through a placing, subscription 
and PrimaryBid retail offer at a price of 260 pence, reflecting a discount of 8.8% to Essentra's closing price on 
Thursday of 285.00p.
Investec dipped 2.9% after the financial services firm announced plans to cut its London office's headcount by 13% 
and said it does not anticipate declaring an interim dividend.
The Anglo-South African corporate and investment banking business expects adjusted earnings per share for the 
first half ending September 30 to be between 10.5p and 8.3p, down 53% to 63% from last year's 22.4p.
The bank plans on cutting its headcount in the London office by 13%, or by 210 roles, after enhancing efficiencies 
by more closely integrating business-enabling functions, Investec said.
In its trading statement on Friday, Investec said it does not expect to declare an interim dividend, versus 11.0p a 
year prior.

(Alliance News) - The UK economy recorded its third straight month of growth in July, amid two consecutive 
quarterly falls, but saw the rate of growth slip, the Office for National Statics said Friday.
As a result, the UK gross domestic product has still only recovered just over half of the lost output caused by the 
coronavirus. 
The ONS noted July's 6.6% growth marked the country's third consecutive monthly increase. In the first and second 
quarter, however, GDP shrank, on a quarterly basis, by 2.2% and 20%, respectively.
On an annual basis, UK gross domestic product fell 21% in the three months to June, having contracted 1.7% in the 
first quarter of 2020.
The second quarter contraction was the largest the UK had seen since 1955.
Hargreaves Lansdown Senior Analyst Susannah Streeter noted that despite the solid growth in July, the UK 
economy is "still languishing way below pre-pandemic levels with so many sectors of the economy suffering from a 
drop in demand".
July GDP is now 19% higher than its April low. However, it remains 12% below the levels seen in February, before 
the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
"Already we have seen how newly imposed quarantine rules have affected the travel industry with British Airways' 
owner IAG and Easyjet announcing more flight cancellations this week due to a fall in bookings and Ryanair calling 
the upcoming winter 'a write off'," Streeter continued. 
She added: "Given signs that the summer's recovery may be faltering, the unwinding of the job retention scheme 
will add another huge spanner to the works, potentially causing fresh waves of mass redundancies, putting 
EXTRA: UK Economy Not Out The Woods Despite Third Monthly Increase
pressure on household incomes and causing another spiralling down in consumer demand. It's unsurprising that 
calls for the extension of the government supported furlough scheme for sectors hit the hardest are coming thick 
and fast."
Monthly gross domestic product grew by 6.6% in July as lockdown measures continued to ease, following growth of 
8.7% in June and 2.4% in May - which followed a record fall of 20% in April.
"While it has continued steadily on the path towards recovery, the UK economy still has to make up nearly half of 
the GDP lost since the start of the pandemic," ONS Director of Economic Statistics Darren Morgan said.
July's monthly figure came in slightly behind market consensus, according to FXStreet, of 6.7% growth.
Kingswood Chief Investment Officer Rupert Thompson said: "The pace of the recovery moderated in July and looks 
certain to slow significantly more over coming months as the initial boost from pent-up demand fades and the 
furlough scheme comes to an end. As the [UK] Chancellor has been keen to point out, the economy is far from out 
of the woods yet."
In the rolling three months to the end of July, UK GDP fell 7.6%, as government restrictions on movement continue 
to dramatically reduce economic activity.
CMC Markets Chief Market Analyst Michael Hewson said: "The reality is that even with all the economic re-
openings that have happened since July it will be enormously difficult to claw back the rest of the lost output quickly 
while social distancing remains in place, as this will continue to act as a handbrake on any recovery. This is 
reflected in the lacklustre rebound in services activity, which improved 6.1% in July, below expectations of 7%."
The ONS's Morgan noted the Education sector "grew strongly" in July, as some children returned to school. He 
continued: "While pubs, campsites and hairdressers all saw notable improvements. Car sales exceeded pre-crisis 
levels for the first time with showrooms having a particularly busy time.
"All areas of manufacturing, particularly distillers and car makers, saw improvements, while housebuilding also 
continued to recover. However, both production and construction remain well below previous levels."
Helal Miah, investment research analyst at the Share Centre, said: "We were always going to see a big rebound as 
this was the month when pubs and restaurants were allowed to open and follows on from June's 8.7% jump when 
non-essential shops were allowed to reopen. The GDP data has been supported by industrial and manufacturing 
data for July both increasing by similar amounts.
Industrial production in July was up 5.2% compared to the previous month, slowing from 9.3% growth in June, but 
coming in ahead of market consensus of 4% growth. Manufacturing production grew 6.3%, following 11% growth in 
June. FXStreet noted forecasts had predicted 5% manufacturing production growth.
In the rolling three month period to the end of July, industrial production is down 3.5% year-on-year.
Miah continued: "This is a good start to the third quarter, which we expect to show the biggest ever quarter increase 
in GDP. In August, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme provided a significant boost to the restaurant sector, and with 
children going back to school in September, people and businesses can slowly go back to work. 
"However, beyond that there remains little now to give short term temporary boosts to the economy; after the 
September monthly numbers, most economists would argue that the big rebounds will have disappeared. Furlough 
schemes are due to come to an end soon, with unemployment rates likely to surge as a result and hitting 
consumption rates. The economy still remains fragile and roughly 12% below the pre-pandemic levels with the UK 
economy forecast to be one of the worst performers during 2020 amongst developed nations."
Analysts at Lloyds Bank noted that the Bank of England's latest forecasts envisage the level of GDP clawing back 
up its pre-crisis level towards the end of next year. 
EXTRA: UK Economy Not Out The Woods Despite Third Monthly Increase
Lloyds continued: "While this would be a relatively quick rebound compared to other downturn episodes, given the 
scale of the challenge facing the recovery, it is likely that both the Bank of England and UK government are likely to 
remain highly sensitive to any signs of faltering in the recovery. As such, the likelihood of further stimulus measures 
being deployed remains high, especially with the outlook challenged by a number of risks."

Head Of IAG Told There Is Still Time To "Do Right Thing"
Head Of IAG Told There Is Still Time To "Do Right Thing"

(Alliance News) - The new boss of British Airways' parent company International Consolidated Airlines Group SA 
has been told there is still time to "do the right thing" and protect the firm's workforce and brand.
Conservative MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, criticised the treatment of staff by the 
company as part of its efforts to mitigate the impact of Covid-19.
It comes after IAG announced that it will be cutting flights due to coronavirus travel restrictions and quarantine 
requirements.
Luis Gallego, who previously ran Spanish airline Iberia, took over as chief executive of IAG on Tuesday, succeeding 
Willie Walsh.
Speaking in the Commons, Merriman said: "There are already 30,00 jobs which have been put at risk directly within 
our aviation sector. We know that there are 3,500 job losses each with respect to Virgin and Ryanair Holdings PLC, 
easyJet PLC, 4,500.
"The select committee report made it quite clear that redundancies were inevitable when we see the drop in 
numbers that we have. But I'm afraid to say, I want to make special mention with regard to British Airways, our 
national flag carrier, with 42,000 staff, 12,000 staff put at risk.
"Those members of staff across the board were given the option of taking voluntary redundancy, which if they didn't 
sign a settlement agreement they would lose their staff travel allowance, or effectively reapply for their old job on 
terms they wouldn't know would be set out.
"So that was a big Russian roulette gamble for them to play and a big risk. If they didn't sign voluntary redundancy 
they could, it said, be looking at reductions in terms of conditions of over 50%. But to not even know that when 
being given that choice, in my view is absolutely shoddy treatment.
Head Of IAG Told There Is Still Time To "Do Right Thing"
"And this at a time where British Airways' parent, IAG, is looking to spend a billion euros on a new airliner when 
66% of its profits was put in by British Airways staff."
Merriman said that he does not believe Gallego will have the same "scorched-earth" approach to industrial relations 
as Walsh did.
He said: "I see an opportunity for British Airways here. It's fair to say that the new chief executive, Luis Gallego, is a 
man who's thoughtful, reasonable and he's two days into his job.
"I don't believe he'll have the same scorched-earth approach to industrial relations as his predecessor. There is still 
time, because these terms have not yet come out, for British Airways to do the right thing."
The MP concluded: "I would say to (Gallego) – this is not too late, you still have time to do the right thing, protect 
your workforce, protect your brand."
Conservative former prime minister Theresa May said that the best way to protect jobs would be to get planes flying 
again.
She told MPs: "I have constituents affected by the British Airways decisions, I have had concerns about those, I've 
raised those with the company.
"But I also have constituents who will be losing jobs at other airlines and at Heathrow Airport itself and that is an 
impact of what we have seen in the rapid reduction of the number of people who are actually flying around the 
world.
"The best way to ensure that those people have jobs, to support those jobs, is to get planes flying again."
Labour's Sam Tarry (Ilford South) said British Airways should be "stripped of the right to have British livery on their 
planes for good unless they decide to treat their staff in a decent and proper way".
Conservative Greg Smith (Buckingham) added: "British Airways has behaved appallingly throughout this crisis."
Transport minister Robert Courts said he would not comment on individual companies.

COMPANIES
----------
Clinical trials of one of the most advanced experimental Covid-19 vaccines, which is being developed by 
pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Oxford University, were "paused" after a volunteer developed an 
unexplained illness. A spokesperson for the AstraZeneca vaccine said in a statement Tuesday that "we voluntarily 
paused vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee. This is a routine action which has 
to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring 
we maintain the integrity of the trials." The company said that in large trials, illnesses will sometimes happen by 
chance but must be reviewed independently. AstraZeneca didn't offer further details, but medical news site Stat 
News, which first reported the volunteer's illness, quoted a source saying it had involved a "serious adverse 
reaction" to the vaccine.

Kosmos Energy has entered an agreement with a unit of Royal Dutch Shell to farm down a portfolio of exploration 
assets for up to USD200 million. Shell's unit BV Dordtsche Petroleum Maatschappij will acquire Kosmos's 
participating interest in blocks offshore Sao Tome & Principe, Suriname, Namibia and South Africa. The 
consideration consists of an upfront cash payment of USD100 million, plus contingent payments of USD50 million 
payable upon each commercial discovery from the first four exploration wells drilled across the assets, capped at 
USD100 million in total. Three of the four wells are currently planned for 2021. Following completion of the farm out 
agreement, Kosmos will retain an exploration portfolio with over six billion barrels of gross resource potential in the

US Gulf of Mexico and west Africa. Kosmos also expects to realise USD125 million in savings over the next two 
years as a result of the Shell deal.
----------
Ryanair Holdings has reduced its annual passenger target to 50 million, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told 
Reuters in an interview. Ryanair in July had guided to 60 million passengers in its current financial year, ending in 
March. In the 2020 financial year, Ryanair carried 149 million passengers. O'Leary said Ryanair is now guiding for 
50 million passengers for the full year to the end of March, though added that "at the moment the way governments 
are handling it the risk is to the downside". The CEO told Reuters that fares will also be "aggressively down", and 
he thinks winter of 2020 "will essentially be a write-off".
----------
Computacenter reported profit growth for the first half, amid an increased demand due to Covid-19 pandemic, and 
said that it has agreed to buy Pivot Technology Solutions in Canada. Revenue for the first half of 2020 rose 1.5% to 
GBP2.46 billion from GBP2.43 billion year-on-year, while pretax profit grew by 43% to GBP72.4 million from 
GBP50.8 million. First half adjusted pretax profit totalled GBP74.6 million, up 39% year-on-year. The IT services 
firm said significant reductions in spend from industrial customers was offset by new business within the 
government and financial services sector. Separately, Computacenter said it has agreed to buy Toronto Stock 
Exchange-listed Pivot Technology Solutions. Computacenter will pay CAD2.60 cash for each Pivot share, the deal 
worth CAD105.8 million - nearly USD80 million or GBP62 million - based on the firm's 40.7 million shares.

The FTSE 100 bounded ahead on Wednesday, helped as the pound continued to soften on Brexit tensions. 
AstraZeneca shares were down 1.3%. Wall Street was pointed to a higher start, rebounding from Tuesday's sell-off, 
which hit tech stocks the hardest. The tech-rich Nasdaq is called up 1.8% on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 is 
pointed up 0.7% and the Dow Jones up 0.5%.

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: AstraZeneca Vaccine Test Paused After Illness
Social gatherings of more than six people will be illegal in England from Monday as the UK government seeks to 
curb the rise in coronavirus cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will use a press conference on Wednesday to 
announce the change in the law after the number of daily positive Covid-19 cases in the UK rose to almost 3,000. 
The legal limit on social gatherings will be reduced from 30 people to six. It will apply to gatherings indoors and 
outdoors – including private homes, as well as parks, pubs and restaurants. Gatherings of more than six people will 
be allowed where the household or support bubble is larger than six, or where the gathering is for work or education 
purposes. Exemptions will also apply for weddings, funerals and Covid-secure organised team sports, with a full list 
to be published by the government before Monday. Some 2,420 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus were recorded 
in Britain as of 9am on Tuesday, following the 2,988 reported in the UK on Sunday, which was the largest daily 
figure since May.
----------
Controversial legislation which would override elements of UK Prime Minister Johnson's Brexit deal with Brussels 
and breach international law will be published on Wednesday. Downing Street had insisted changes in the Internal 
Market Bill were simply "limited clarifications" to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if they failed to secure a 
free trade deal with the EU. But Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis provoked a furious reaction when he 
confirmed to MPs on Tuesday that the legislation would breach international law in a "very specific and limited way". 
The Bill, which will be tabled on Wednesday afternoon, is intended to ensure Northern Ireland can continue to enjoy 
unfettered access to markets in the rest of the UK. Lewis said the powers the government was taking would enable 
ministers to "dis-apply" the EU legal concept of "direct effect" – which requires the enforcement of EU law – in 
"certain, very tightly defined circumstances". Meanwhile, the latest round of talks on a post-Brexit trade deal 
continue in London between the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier and the UK's Lord Frost.
----------
Chinese inflation moderated in August, data showed, as a slowdown in the surging price of pork tempered food 
costs. The consumer price index hit 2.4%, in line with forecasts and below the previous month's reading, as pork 
saw its slowest increase in a year, while analysts said the easing could also be attributed to a high base 
comparison. Dong Lijuan at the National Bureau of Statistics, which released the figures, said pork supplies had 
improved but noted that the cost of other meats also rose, "affected by factors such as rising feed costs, recovery in 
demand, and rising pork prices". The price of pork, a staple in China, has been soaring for more than a year after 
the country's pig herds were ravaged last year by African swine fever, which forced the culling of at least a million 
animals. The meat's price rose 53% on-year in August, a slowdown from the 86% surge in July and more than 
100% earlier in 2020.
----------
US President Donald Trump will announce further troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan in the next few 
days, a senior administration official said Tuesday. The official told reporters traveling with the president to expect 
an announcement Wednesday on Iraq, and on Afghanistan in the coming days. During a meeting with Iraqi Prime 
Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi in August, Trump said American troops would leave Iraq but gave no timetable. The 
talks between the pair came with attacks on American targets by pro-Iranian fighters on the rise and the Iraqi 
government facing calls to expel the roughly 5,000 US troops deployed in the country as part of anti-jihadist efforts. 
The US military withdrew from Iraq in late 2011, leaving a small mission attached to the US embassy.

(Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Friday it has raised EUR400 million in a share 
placing to institutional investors. 
First announced after the London market close on Thursday, Ryanair said the funds were being raised to help 
position the firm to "move quickly" should opportunities in the sector be thrown up.
"Post Covid-19 growth opportunities include gaining market share from peers retrenching, further European airline 
failures and competitive unit cost advantage over other carriers. The placing will provide Ryanair with greater 
financial flexibility to capture these opportunities," said Ryanair on Thursday.
The placing should also "significantly de-risk" the group's debt repayments over the next 12 months.
A total of 35.2 million shares were placed at a price of EUR11.35 each, Ryanair said on Friday morning, the price 
representing a 2.6% discount to Thursday's closing quote. The airline was trading 1.8% higher at EUR11.88 on 
Friday morning. 
"Ryanair consulted with a number of its major shareholders prior to the placing and has endeavoured to respect the 
principles of pre-emption through the allocation process insofar as possible. The company is pleased by the strong 
support it has received from new and existing shareholders," the airline said. 
Following admission, Ryanair will have 1.13 billion shares in issue. 
Ryanair on Thursday added that 2020 has proven to be "the most challenging period in Ryanair's 35-year history", 
though believes it has responded well.

On Wednesday, Ryanair said traffic in August dropped by 53% to 7.0 million passengers versus the 14.9 million 
passengers it carried a year earlier. The carrier said it operated about 60% of its normal August schedule, with a 
73% load factor.
Despite August showing sharp declines, it represented strong growth from July, when the budget airline saw 
passengers crater 97% to 400,000.

UK ministers are under fire from holidaymakers and the travel industry for failing to provide "clarity" after Portugal 
and Greece retained their places on England's coronavirus quarantine exemption list. Wales and Scotland have 
added restrictions to passengers returning from the summer holiday hotspots, but the UK government said on 
Thursday there would be no change to its list. There had been speculation that Westminster would reimpose the 
quarantine requirement on Portugal due to a spike in Covid-19 cases, leading many holidaymakers to pay hundreds 
of pounds to fly home this week. The government was also under pressure to reimpose quarantine rules on arrivals 
from Greece after Scotland and Wales introduced restrictions in recent days. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps 
announced on Thursday evening that there were no changes to the Government's list, though he said he would not 
"hesitate to remove countries if needed".

senior staff, with more than 22,000 workers deployed across Whitehall departments on the preparations which cost 
GBP4.4 billion. The findings have emerged in a study by the National Audit Office which examined the lessons to 
be learned from the government's attempts to ready the country for Brexit following the 2016 Leave referendum 
result. Meanwhile, members of the logistics industry have warned the government the supply chain "will be severely 
disrupted" next year if "significant gaps" in UK border plans are not resolved before Brexit. Eight logistics 
organisations including the Road Haulage Association have written to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove 
requesting a meeting about technological and infrastructure concerns, according to a copy of the letter seen by the

German manufacturing orders climbed on a monthly basis, with its annual decline easing as the sector inches 
closer to pre-lockdown levels, data showed. Monthly, new orders in manufacturing climbed 2.8% in July, Destatis

While the monthly figure disappointed the market which expected a 5% climb, FXStreet-supplied consensus also 
anticipated a 20% yearly plunge, meaning the 7.3% fall was a pleasant surprise.

Berkeley Group, which is holding its annual general meeting on Friday, said recent trading has been resilient. For

of GBP500 million of pretax profit for the full-year. The company also reaffirmed its commitment to its shareholder 
returns programme of GBP280 million per annum. The upmarket housebuilder added that it anticipated a more 
even split of profit between the first and second halves of the year, following better-than-expected levels of 
production and robust pricing. Berkeley's update came as the UK Competition & Markets Authority opened 
enforcement cases focusing on the sale of leasehold homes by four leading housebuilders. The CMA's probe 
pertains to Barratt Developments, Countryside Properties, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey. The probe comes after 
the CMA uncovered what it called "troubling evidence of potentially unfair terms concerning ground rents in 
leasehold contracts and potential mis-selling."

Malaysia has dropped criminal charges against Goldman Sachs Group over its role in the 1MDB scandal, a lawyer 
for the bank said. Billions of dollars were looted from sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad in a 
fraud that involved former prime minister Najib Razak and his cronies that spanned the globe. The money was used 
to buy everything from expensive artwork to real estate and a massive luxury superyacht.  Goldman's role came 
under scrutiny over bond issues totalling USD6.5 billion it helped arrange for the investment vehicle, with Malaysia 
claiming large amounts were misappropriated during the process. Authorities previously pursued all those involved 
in the scandal and filed charges against the Wall Street titan but state news agency Bernama reported that 
prosecutors told a Kuala Lumpur court they no longer intended to pursue them. Hisyam Teh, a lawyer for the bank, 
confirmed to AFP that acquittal orders were granted.

the virus that causes Covid-19 in humans. The vaccine candidate is currently being evaluated in clinical studies to 
set up the performance of the candidate in humans. "This pre-clinical study further validates our confidence in our 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. With our phase three trials planned to start this month, we remain committed to 
expanding our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to enable global access to our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
candidate should it prove to be safe and effective in humans," said Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels.

The UK competition regulator said it has found "troubling evidence" house developers have handed out "potentially

Apple is delaying a new privacy feature in the next version of its iPhone operating system that will make it more 
difficult for app makers to track people online to help sell digital ads. The decision affects iOS 14, which is expected 
to be released as a free software upgrade to roughly a billion iPhone users later this month. Apple intended iOS 14 
to automatically block tracking as soon as it came out, but the company now says it will hold back the tool until early 
next year. The safeguard was also supposed be in the next operating systems for iPads and Apple TVs. The 
feature would require apps to explicitly ask users to give permission to collect and share data about their online 
behaviour through a unique code that identifies every iPhone. That requirement raised fears that most people would 
block the tracking, making it more difficult for free apps to sell the ads that generate most of their revenue.

Activity in the UK construction sector unexpectedly slowed in August as companies pointed to a shortage of new 
work, IHS Markit said. The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS UK construction purchasing managers' index 
registered 54.6 in August, down from 58.1 in July. The reading missed the consensus estimate, cited by FXStreet, 
of 58.5. Still, the score remained above the 50.0 mark which separates expansion from contraction. Markit said the 
August data pointed to a setback for the recovery in UK construction output, with growth easing from the near five-

year high seen during July. Survey respondents mostly suggested that a lack of new work to replace completed 
projects had acted as a brake on the speed of expansion.
----------
The decline in the eurozone's construction sector picked up pace in August, registering its sharpest fall in three 
months. The IHS Markit eurozone construction purchasing managers' index slipped to 47.8 in August, deeper below 
the 50.0 no-change mark, from 48.9 in July. "Survey data showed a broad-based downturn in output across the 
three sectors, with the sharpest decline recorded in civil engineering activity, followed by commercial building 
output," Markit noted, adding that the single-currency area's August construction decline was its fastest in three 
months. 
----------
German manufacturing orders climbed on a monthly basis, with its annual decline easing as the sector inches 
closer to pre-lockdown levels, data showed. Monthly, new orders in manufacturing climbed 2.8% in July, Destatis 
said, building on a 29% surge in June. Annually, new orders were 7.3% lower, easing from an 11% fall in June. 
While the monthly figure disappointed the market which expected a 5% climb, FXStreet-supplied consensus also 
anticipated a 20% yearly plunge, meaning the 7.3% fall was a pleasant surprise.
----------
UK Transport secretary Grant Shapps has acknowledged that varying advice for quarantining when arriving in 
different UK nations from abroad "creates confusion", amid holidaymakers' calls for clarity. Shapps defended the 
UK government's decision not to impose restrictions on people entering England from Greece and Portugal despite 
the Scotland and Wales ordering periods of isolation to slow the spread of coronavirus. He said quarantine powers 
laid with the devolved administrations and added that Westminster decided not to impose the measure on the 
popular holiday destinations because figures suggested cases were falling. Shapps told Sky News: "I do realise it 
creates confusion for people not to have a single rule, but we do have this devolved approach throughout the UK 
and I can only be responsible for the English part of that."

Diners in Britain ate over 100 million cut-price meals as part of the UK's Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which the UK 
government said helped protect the country's 1.8 million hospitality jobs. UK government numbers showed 84,700 
establishments signed up to the scheme, making 130,000 claims between them worth a total of GBP522 million. 
The programme, running on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday during in August, allowed diners to get 50% off 
meals up to GBP10 each, in a bid by the UK government to get customers through the doors of establishments and 
ease pressure on businesses which were battered by Covid-19 lockdowns.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening lower on Friday sparked by heavy losses in the US on 
Thursday, as investors look ahead to the US jobs report later in the day.
In early company news, housebuilder Berkeley Group maintained its profit guidance after resilient trading, as the 
UK Competition & Markets Authority launched a probe into four other London-listed homebuilders. Irish carrier 
Ryanair Holdings raised EUR400 via a share placing. Ad agency WPP and energy provider Centrica announced 
respective acquisitions. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 33.26 points lower at 5,817.60. The blue-chip index closed down 
90.09 points, or 1.5%, at 5,850.86 on Thursday.
Berkeley Group, which is holding its annual general meeting on Friday, said recent trading has been resilient. 
For the period spanning May 1 to August 31, Berkely said trading has been resilient and supports its existing 
guidance of GBP500 million of pretax profit for the full-year. The company also reaffirmed its commitment to its 
shareholder returns programme of GBP280 million per annum.
Berkeley reiterated that a dividend of 107.0 pence will be paid next Friday, with the remainder of the GBP140.1 
million return already paid via share buybacks. In addition, the next GBP140.1 million shareholder return will be 
provided by March-end, through a combination of dividends and share buy-backs.
The upmarket housebuilder added that it anticipated a more even split of profit between the first and second halves 
of the year, following better-than-expected levels of production and robust pricing.
Berkeley's update comes as the UK Competition & Markets Authority opened enforcement cases focusing on the 
sale of leasehold homes by four leading housebuilders.
The CMA's probe pertains to Barratt Developments, Countryside Properties, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: UK CMA Launches Probe Into Four Housebuilders
The probe comes after the CMA uncovered what it called "troubling evidence of potentially unfair terms concerning 
ground rents in leasehold contracts and potential mis-selling." 
The watchdog is concerned that leasehold homeowners may have been unfairly treated and that buyers may have 
been misled by property developers.
WPP said its subsidiary Wunderman Thompson acquired French customer experience consultancy Velvet 
Consulting, for an undisclosed sum. WPP said the acquisition forms a key part of its wider strategic transformation, 
which is investment in technology services. Velvet Consulting's clients include L'Oreal, Sephora, Schneider Electric, 
Fnac Darty, La Poste Group, Pierre Fabre and Sanofi. 
Centrica said it has agreed to acquire the energy supply customers of Robin Hood Energy via its British Gas 
business, for an undisclosed sum. 
Robin Hood Energy currently has around 112,000 residential customers, and 2,600 business customers across 
10,000 sites. Completion of the transaction is expected on September 16, with customers moving to British Gas 
over the next few months, Centrica said. 
Ryanair Holdings confirmed it raised EUR400 million via the placing of 35.2 million shares at EUR11.35 each. The 
placing price represents a discount of 2.6% to the closing share price on Thursday.
On Thursday, the Irish carrier said the placing will better position the company to be able to move quickly and 
capitalise on future opportunities, such as growing its network and expand its fleet.
In the US on Thursday, Wall Street ended firmly in the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 2.8%, S&P 
500 down 3.5% and Nasdaq Composite closing down 5.0%.
All three main indices in New York suffered hefty selling, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq led the way with tech giants 
such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook among the worst hit.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.1% on Friday. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 1.0%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 1.5%.
"Equity markets in Asia are in the red as the massive declines in the US dented sentiment. European markets are 
tipped to open lower, and US index futures point to further losses," said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.
Investor focus is now on the release on Friday at 1330 BST of US jobs data, which will provide the latest snapshot 
of the world's largest economy.
US nonfarm payrolls are forecast to rise 1.4 million in August, down from 1.8 million in July. The unemployment rate 
is predicted to drop to 9.8% in August from 10.2% in July.
The pound was at USD1.3273 early Friday, flat from USD1.3272 at the London equities close Thursday.
UK ministers are under fire from holidaymakers and the travel industry for failing to provide "clarity" after Portugal 
and Greece retained their places on England's coronavirus quarantine exemption list. Wales and Scotland have 
added restrictions to passengers returning from the summer holiday hotspots, but the UK government said on 
Thursday there would be no change to its list.
The euro stood at USD1.1846, up from USD1.1825. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY106.19, flat from 
JPY106.17.
Gold was quoted at USD1,933.66 an ounce Friday morning, up from USD1,926.09 an ounce at the London equities 
close Thursday. Brent oil was quoted at USD43.69 a barrel, up from USD43.42.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday announced a share placing to raise EUR400 million in 
proceeds through an accelerated bookbuild so it is better placed to take advantage of future opportunities.
The Irish low-cost airline said the number of shares and the placing price for each will be determined after the 
bookbuild.
The company said: "So far, 2020 has proven to be the most challenging period in Ryanair's 35-year history and an 
unprecedented difficult environment for the wider European airline sector. 
"The group believes that it has responded well and that the current environment is likely to result in long-term 
impacts for the sector which it expects will create opportunities for Ryanair to grow its network, and expand its fleet, 
to take advantage of lower airport and aircraft cost opportunities that are likely to arise."
The placing will better position the group to be able to move quickly and capitalise on such opportunities should 
they present themselves.
Davy is acting as sole bookrunner for the placing.
Ryanair had EUR3.90 billion in cash on June 30 as well as 333 unencumbered B737s, worth around EUR7.00 
billion. 
Ryainair said: "Over the medium-term Ryanair will continue to focus on cash generation and the repayment of 
approximately EUR1.90 billion of maturing debt which includes a EUR850.0 million Eurobond and GBP600 million 
raised under the UK's Covid Corporate Financing Facility maturing in June and March 2021 respectively."
The company hopes to accept the delivery of its first Boeing MAX-200 before the 2021 summer, as well as 
potentially up to 40 MAX aircrafts.

(Alliance News) - Rival budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC both saw a sharp drop in 
passengers in August but recorded strong rebounds from July.
Ryanair's traffic in August dropped by 53% to 7.0 million passengers versus the 14.9 million passengers it carried a 
year earlier.
On a rolling annual basis to August, the airline said it carried 88.9 million passengers, down 40% from 149.2 million 
a year prior.
The Irish carrier said it operated about 60% of its normal August schedule, with a 73% load factor.
Despite August showing sharp declines, it represented strong growth from July, when the budget airline saw 
passengers crater 97% to 400,000.
Central and eastern European-focused Wizz Air separately reported an 41% fall in August passenger numbers to 
2.4 million from 4.0 million in August 2019.
In a similar tale to Ryanair, Wizz Air's August passengers figure was a rebound from July's 86% drop to 502,253.
Capacity plummeted 20% year-on-year to 3.4 million seats from 4.2 million in August 2019, while the airline's load 
factor fell 25 basis points to 70.9% from 96.3%.
In July, Wizz Air's capacity was down 76%.
Available seat kilometres in August fell 19% to 5.54 billion, as revenue passenger kilometres plunged 40% to 3.98 
billion.

On a rolling basis to August, passengers were down 29% to 26.7 million, while capacity fell 22% to 31.1 million. 
Load factor slipped 7.7 basis points to 85.7%.
More positively, Wizz Air opened 2 new bases in the month - both in the UK, with one in Doncaster and one at 
London's Gatwick airport - and has launched 33 new routes.
Shares in Ryanair were 1.2% lower in London on Wednesday morning at EUR11.69 each. Wizz Air was trading 
2.3% lower at 3,655.38 pence.

(Alliance News) - Two men detained after a Ryanair flight to the UK was intercepted by RAF fighter jets have been 
released without charge after a suspicious object left in the toilet was found to be a mobile phone.
A 34-year-old Kuwaiti national and a 48-year-old Italian were held by officers from the Eastern Region Special 
Operations Unit after their flight landed at Stansted shortly after 7pm on Sunday.
The RAF confirmed that Typhoon fighters from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire had been scrambled to intercept the 
aircraft and escort it into the airport in Essex.
The two men had arrived on a flight from Vienna and were detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, police 
said.
ERSOU said on Monday that an object thought to be suspicious found in the plane's bathroom had been examined 
and "found not to be of concern".
The force said the two men had been spoken with and neither were considered to have committed any offence.
An ERSOU spokesman said the object was a mobile phone.
Detective Superintendent Andy Waldie, head of ERSOU's Counter Terrorism Policing unit, said: "We 
understandably take any reports of suspicious objects or behaviour on flights very seriously and thankfully on this 
occasion there was no cause for concern.
"I'd like to thank those on the flight for their co-operation and understanding while officers conducted their inquiries."
Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Sunday evening that all passengers on board had disembarked safely, while those 
waiting to depart to Vienna had been transferred to a spare aircraft to avoid delays.

aircraft. The aircraft was escorted safely to Stansted".
A Ryanair Holdings PLC spokesman said the crew of the flight from Vienna to the Essex airport had been alerted to 
a "potential security threat on board".
He added: "In line with procedures, the captain informed UK authorities and continued to London Stansted, where 
the aircraft landed normally and taxied to a remote stand where passengers disembarked safely.
"Passengers in London Stansted waiting to depart to Vienna were transferred to a spare aircraft to minimise the 
delay to their flight."
Police said inquiries are ongoing.

(Alliance News) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, which has slashed its flight capacity as a result of the 
pandemic, said Thursday its pilots in Spain had accepted a 20% pay cut to minimise job losses
Under the four-year agreement reached with Spanish pilots union SEPLA, pilots also accepted "flexible working 
patterns" which will allow the airline to improve its productivity, Ryanair said in a statement.
"This agreement gives Ryanair a framework to flex its operation during the Covid-19 crisis and a pathway to 
recovery when the business returns to normal in the years ahead".
At the same time, the company said it had failed to strike a deal with Spanish cabin crew unions USO and 
SITCPLA, which means "job losses are now more likely" among their members.
Ryanair announced Monday that it would cut is September and October timetable by 20% due to weaker-than-
expected demand following renewed virus-linked travel restrictions in some European countries.
The company said the cuts would focus on countries such as Spain and France where a recent rise in coronavirus 
cases has led to increased travel restrictions.
Ryanair booked a net loss of EUR185 million euros in the three months to the end of June, the first quarter of its 
financial year.
In response to the coronavirus-induced downturn, Ryanair is seeking to axe 3,000 jobs and has not ruled out further 
cutbacks.
The pandemic has ravaged the global aviation sector, sparking heavy losses, job cuts, bankruptcies and state 
rescue plans.
Shares in Ryanair closed 3.2% lower in London on Thursday at EUR11.13 each.

Wednesday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
International Consolidated Airlines Group, up 2.8%. The British Airways parent was higher amid plans by Heathrow 
Airport for the development of a new coronavirus testing facility. Heathrow hopes this could lead to the end of the 
mandatory 14-day quarantine for those returning from certain countries and "protect the economy". Arriving 
passengers will be able to book swab tests and have results sent to them in seven hours under the proposal, which 
is being used in Germany and Iceland. Heathrow executives hope those who test negative could leave quarantine 
five to eight days after landing, though the airport's programme needs UK government approval before it can begin. 
Budget airline easyJet was up 1.0% and Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was up 0.9%.
----------
Associated British Foods, up 1.8%. RBC Capital raised the Primark clothing chain owner to Outperform from Sector 
Perform. The Canadian bank thinks Primark can drive profitability for AB Foods as its low-value products are ideal 
for fashion-conscious consumers during an economic downturn.

Persimmon, down 3.1%. The housebuilder was hit by profit-taking after reporting well-received interim results on 
Tuesday. The stock closed up 8.0% on Tuesday. Separately on Wednesday, Persimmon said incoming chief 
executive Dean Finch is expected to take up the role earlier than originally planned. Finch will leave his role as CEO 
of FTSE 250 transport operator National Express Group on August 31. National Express was off 3.8%.

Capita, up 12%. Shares in the outsourcer were rebounding from steep losses incurred on Tuesday. The stock 
closed down 20% on Tuesday. Capita swung to a loss and reported a fall in revenue following contract losses in 
2019 and damage caused by Covid-19, when it had expected to post revenue growth.
----------
Softcat, up 3.0%. The IT infrastructure products provider said it saw a good final three months of the financial year 
and has performed slightly ahead of its expectations. Softcat said it delivered an operating profit for its financial year 
ended July 31, ahead of expectations. It also reported that it had "continued to trade satisfactorily" in the final three 
months of its year and cash generation was strong. Following these results, the company has decided to resume its 
dividend policy after cancelling its previous interim dividend in March, which has now been reinstated. This, 
however, depends on there being no big changes until October 20, when Softcat publishes its full-year results.

FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
Hochschild Mining, down 6.5%. The gold miner's profit sharply declined in the first half of 2020, as the Covid-19 
pandemic resulted in stoppages at all mines between mid-March and late May. Hochschild posted a USD6.5 million 
pretax profit for the six months ended June 30, a fraction of the previous year's USD29.5 million profit. Revenue 
dropped 35% year-on-year to USD232.0 million from USD354.5 million as production shrank 47% to 126,835 gold 
equivalent ounces from 239,090 gold equivalent ounces. In addition, Hochschild has decided not to reinstate its 
dividend.
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Wishbone Gold, up 85%. The miner said it is now planning to start an active exploration and drilling programme at 
its Wishbone II gold project in Queensland, Australia. The decision to begin the programme follows Wishbone's 
"major corporate restructuring exercise" that left the company debt-free and with cash at bank. This exercise took 
place in late May with 63.5 million new shares issued at 1.35 pence each. This included 22.2 million shares to raise 
GBP300,000 through a placing, 13.0 million shares issued to settle GBP175,689 of directors and management 
fees, and 28.1 million shares issued for the conversion of outstanding loans with Sanderson Capital Partners and 
Black Swan, as well as to discharge other creditors. The restructuring left Wishbone with no significant liabilities and 
enough cash for the foreseeable future at that time.

existing and new investors. The issue price represents a discount of 23% to the closing price of 16.50p on Tuesday. 
The net proceeds from the fundraising will primarily be used towards completion of certain key components of a 
pre-feasibility study in respect of the company's wholly-owned Toral lead-zinc-silver project located in the Castilla y

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it will cut its September and October capacity by 20% as 
rising Covid-19 cases in Europe have led to increased travel restrictions and fewer bookings. 
The budget carrier said most of these cuts will come in the form of fewer flights, rather than full route closures. 
The 20% cut comes after "forward bookings have notably weakened over the last 10 days".
Ryanair added that the reduction in flights will be focused on countries like Spain, France and Sweden where 
Covid-19 cases have risen and have seen travel restrictions tighten. 
Ryanair's native Ireland is affected as well, due to its "uniquely restrictive" Green List, which imposes 14-day 
quarantine measures on all travellers coming from countries such as Germany and the UK. Ryanair noted these 
countries have actually had lower case rates than Ireland over the past two weeks. 
"These capacity cuts and frequency reductions for the months of September & October are necessary given the 
recent weakness in forward bookings due to Covid restrictions in a number of EU countries," Ryanair said. 
"Over the past 2 weeks as a number of EU countries have raised travel restrictions, forward bookings especially for 
business travel into September & October have been negatively affected, and it makes sense to reduce frequencies 
so that we tailor our capacity to demand over the next 2 months."
Ryanair shares were 2.8% lower at EUR11.23 each in London on Monday afternoon.

International Consolidated Airlines, down 6.5%. Shares in the British Airways parent were lower after the UK added 
France to its 14-day quarantine list. People arriving in the UK after 0400 BST on Saturday will be required to spend 
14 days in self-isolation due to rising numbers of coronavirus cases in France. The conditions will also apply to 
travellers returning to the UK from the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks & Caicos and Aruba. The move, which 
applies throughout the UK, comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to be "absolutely ruthless" in 
decisions about imposing quarantine restrictions on countries. "The problem for the airlines is that people's desire 
for a break in the sun may be outweighed by their fear of the logistical challenges of holing up for two weeks when 
they get back, with decisions on which countries to add to the quarantine list often coming at short notice. This 
decision will feel particularly painful as it comes at the height of the UK holiday season and the question now 
becomes just how long the likes of EasyJet, Ryanair and British Airways-owner IAG can continue under these 
conditions," AJ Bell's Russ Mould commented.

easyJet, down 7.5%, Tui, down 5.8%. The travel stocks were dealt a blow by the UK government decision to add 
France to the quarantine list. "With France being added to the quarantine list for the UK, travel & leisure is under 
pressure. Shares in IAG, Ryanair, Tui and EasyJet were all sharply lower as the move will force a large swathe of 
cancellations right at the peak of the summer holiday season for one of the largest markets for UK tourists. Half a

Ryanair Holdings was down 4.9% and Dart Group, which owns the Jet2 airline, was down 9.5%.

WH Smith, down 5.5%. Shares in the books, magazines and confectionery retailer were also lower as part of the 
UK's new quarantine travel rules. WH Smith generates a substantial amount of its revenue from stores in airports 
and train stations. "Related stocks were also hit. WH Smith - purveyor of overpriced sweets and Evian - slipped 
down the board as a result. Apart from the immediate damage this will do at the height of the school holidays and

Verona Pharma, up 28%. The pharmaceutical company said the impact of Covid-19 on clinical trials in the first half 
has been limited, and the company remains on track to start its Phase 3 clinical trials with Ensifentrine for the 
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease later in 2020. The company also said it has received a notice 
from US Food & Drug Administration to proceed with a study of Ensifentrine in patients with Covid-19. The 
company plans to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot clinical study to evaluate Ensifentrine 
delivered via pressurized metered-dose inhaler formulation as a treatment for patients hospitalized with Covid-19 at 
the University of Alabama. The study is expected to start in the third quarter of 2020. Ensifentrine is an 
investigational inhaled therapy that has been shown to act as both a bronchodilator and an anti-inflammatory agent 
in one compound.

Bluejay Mining, up 12%. The miner said it completed a final public consultation meeting as part of its attempts to ink 
an exploitation licence for a project in Greenland. The public consultation for the Dundas ilmenite project was 
previously hit with delays. Due to Covid-19 affecting consultation meetings, the government of Greenland extended 
the consultation period from eight to 10 weeks, Dundas said in June. And in July, Bluejay had agreed an offtake 
deal with a "multinational commodity trading firm" at Dundas increased. The new agreement increased the amount

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened lower on Friday as economic data from China raised fears over its 
economic recovery, while travel stocks fell after the UK added France to its 14-day quarantine list. 
In London, early Friday, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 54.94 points, or 0.8%, at 6,137.20. The mid-cap 
FTSE 250 index was down 102.88 points, or 0.6% at 17,814.50. The AIM All-Share index was off 0.1% at 955.87.
The Cboe UK 100 index was down 0.9% at 611.69. The Cboe 250 was down 0.8% at 15,230.68, and the Cboe 
Small Companies was flat at 9,631.65.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 index in Paris was down 0.2%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 0.4%.
"After a couple of sessions arguably on the sidelines, Covid-19 returned to the forefront of investors' minds following 
the latest China data dump and another UK travel update. Once again Chinese retail sales became a sticking point 
for the markets," said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
"July's reading marked the second month in a row that retail sales in the country had failed to climb back into 
positive territory as expected. Combine that with an industrial production reading that remained unchanged at 4.8%, 
missing the forecast 5.1%, and there are signs of a stalling recovery in the superpower," Campbell added. 
On the London Stock Exchange, British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines was the worst blue-chip 
performer, down 4.0% after UK quarantine measures were imposed on France, effective from Saturday.
Midcap budget airline easyJet was down 5.5% and Anglo-German travel firm Tui was down 5.6%. Irish carrier 
Ryanair Holdings was down 3.5%. In addition, WH Smith - which generates a substantial amount of its revenue 
from stores in airports and train stations - was the worst midcap performer, down 8.0%.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Travel Stocks Weigh As UK Quarantine List Grows
People arriving in the UK after 0400 BST on Saturday will be required to spend 14 days in self-isolation due to 
rising numbers of coronavirus cases in France. The conditions will also apply to travellers returning to the UK from 
the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks & Caicos and Aruba.
The move, which applies throughout the UK, comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to be "absolutely 
ruthless" in decisions about imposing quarantine restrictions on countries.
The Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England detected a significant change in Covid-19 risk in all six 
destinations.
"With France being added to the quarantine list for the UK, travel & leisure is under pressure. Shares in IAG, 
Ryanair, Tui and EasyJet were all sharply lower as the move will force a large swathe of cancellations right at the 
peak of the summer holiday season for one of the largest markets for UK tourists. Half a million Brits are thought to 
be in France right now," said Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson.
"Related stocks were also hit. WH Smith - purveyor of overpriced sweets and Evian - slipped down the board as a 
result. Apart from the immediate damage this will do at the height of the school holidays and peak summer season, 
the quarantine decision also underlines the inherent risk you take in booking a holiday abroad right now, which will 
do nothing for consumer confidence," Wilson added.
Elsewhere, easyJet said it has completed the sale and leaseback of 23 aircraft, generating USD771 million in 
proceeds.
The proceeds of the sale will be used to maximise liquidity and further strengthen easyJet's financial position. The 
USD771 million, or GBP608 million, proceeds is at the upper end of the company's GBP500 million to GBP650 
million forecast range.
The final transaction was executed with Jin Shan 37 Ireland Co, a unit of Bocomm Leasing, for the sale and 
leaseback of five A321neo aircraft for USD266 million.
The agreement will see the aircraft leased back until each of them reach 10 years of age. Following the deal, 50% 
of the company's fleet remains unencumbered.
easyJet said it has now raised over GBP2.4 billion since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic to maximise 
liquidity and strengthen its financial position.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.2%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 1.2%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.1%.
China's retail sales dropped in July, official data showed Friday. The key indicator of consumer sentiment shrank by 
1.1% on-year, falling short of forecasts and suggesting many are still reticent about going out to spend time and 
money, even as China appears to have the virus largely under control. The latest data follows a drop of 1.8% on-
year for retail sales in June.
Industrial production grew by 4.8% in July, the same as the previous month but below predictions of 5.2% growth.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3067 on Friday morning, down from USD1.3084 at London equities close 
Thursday.
The euro was priced at USD1.1817, lower from USD1.1830. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY106.85, 
flat from JPY106.90.
In commodities, Brent oil was trading at USD45.11 a barrel Friday morning, flat from USD45.18 a barrel Thursday 
evening in London.

Gold was quoted at USD1,953.86 an ounce, slightly higher from USD1,947.60 an ounce at the London equities 
close Thursday.
In Friday's economic calendar, there is the eurozone GDP reading at 1000 BST. Then in the afternoon, there is US 
retail sales at 1330 BST, with industrial production at 1415 BST and the Michigan consumer sentiment index at 
1500 BST.

(Alliance News) - Italy's national civil aviation authority ENAC threatened on Wednesday to suspend Ryanair 
Holdings PLC's permit to fly in the country over alleged non-compliance with coronavirus safety rules, but the low-
cost carrier denied flouting them.
The authority accused the Irish airline of "repeated violations of the Covid-19 health regulations currently in force 
and imposed by the Italian government to protect the health of passengers".
"Not only is the obligation to distance passengers not respected, but the conditions for making an exception to that 
rule are also being ignored", it said in a statement.
If Ryanair continued to break the rules ENAC would "suspend all air transport activities at national airports, 
requiring the carrier to re-route all passengers already in possession of tickets," it said.
"The claims made in ENAC's press release today are factually incorrect," Ryanair responded.
"Ryanair complies fully with the measures set out by the Italian government and our customers can rest assured 
that we are doing everything to reduce interaction on both our aircraft and at airports to protect the health of our 
passengers."
Italy was the first EU country to be seriously affected by the pandemic, which has officially killed over 35,000, but its 
contagion rate is currently far below levels seen in other parts of the bloc.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday reported a steep drop in 
passenger numbers amid airspace and travel restrictions placed around the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Irish budget carrier Ryanair saw a 70% year-on-year drop in July traffic as it operated just 40% of its July schedule 
with a 72% load factor. It carried 4.4 million passengers in July compared with 14.8 million a year ago. Year-to-date 
passenger numbers fell 35% to 96.8 million.
Central and Eastern Europe-focused Wizz Air saw a 53% year-on-year drop in July passenger numbers to 1.8 
million from 3.9 million a year ago. Load factor declined to 60.5% from 95.6% and capacity was down 26% to 3.0  
million seats.
Year-to-date, Wizz Air passenger numbers fell 23% in July to 28.3 million. Load factor was down to 88.6% from 
93.2%.
Shares in FTSE 250-listed Wizz Air were up 4.0% at 3,302.00 pence each in London on Tuesday morning. Ryanair 
stock was trading 2.7% higher at EUR11.15 each.
Separately, rival airline easyJet PLC said that it will expand its flying schedule following improved customer demand 
and that third-quarter performance was in line with expectations, with a restart to flying during the period following 
lifting of Covid-19 related travel restrictions.
easyJet expects to fly 40% of planned capacity for the fourth quarter ending September 30. The company 
previously estimated to fly 30% of its capacity in the fourth-quarter.
Shares in easyjet were up 9.9% at 557.35p in London.

(Correcting that passengers fell to 500,000.)
(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday turned to a loss in the first quarter due to travel restrictions put 
in place because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The budget airline swung to a loss of GBP185 million in the first quarter ended June 30 from a net profit of GBP243 
million a year ago. 
The company saw 99% of its fleet grounded from mid-March to the end of June due to travel restrictions caused by 
Covid-19. Passengers fell to 500,000 in the quarter from 41.9 million a year ago.
"The past quarter was the most challenging in Ryanair's 35 year history. Covid-19 grounded the group's fleet for 
almost 4 months as EU governments imposed flight or travel bans and widespread population lockdowns," Ryanair 
said. 
Ryanair implemented an 85% reduction in costs during the quarter which it said was not enough to offset the heavy 
revenue losses.
The company's balance sheet consists of GBP3.9 billion in cash at June 30, one of the strongest in the industry 
according to Ryanair.
"Since mid-March, the group has moved quickly and smartly to preserve cash, cut costs, cancel share buybacks 
and defer all non-essential capital expenditure. This has protected the group's very strong liquidity position as it 
returns to flying in July," Ryanair said. 
CORRECT: Ryanair Swings To Loss In "Most Challenging" Quarter
The company continued: "The group currently expects to carry approximately 60 million passengers in this financial 
year and expects to record a smaller loss in the second quarter (which reflects a gradual return to flying from July 1) 
than in the first quarter.
"However, the Ryanair Group will emerge from the Covid-19 crisis with a much lower cost base, which will be 
essential to fund lower fares as the group competes against unlawfully state aided flag carriers."
Ryanair cannot provide any financial guidance at the moment due to the uncertainty posed by Covid-19.
Ryanair resumed flights across the majority of its network in July and expects to operate around 40% of its normal 
schedule this month, rising to 60% in August and hopefully 70% in September.

LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair Expect 60% Drop In Passengers In Current Year
China on Monday reported its highest number of coronavirus cases in three months, part of a worrying swell of 
second and third-wave infections that are hitting Asia and Europe. Australia has been rocked by its deadliest surge 
since the start of the pandemic, Hong Kong is experiencing record daily numbers and Spain's caseload has tripled 
in the last fortnight. Meanwhile, other regions are still battling their first waves after never getting the virus under 
control: the US alone has recorded almost 4.23 million cases of COVID-19, while infections in Latin America and 
the Caribbean surged on Sunday to briefly overtake North America's total for the first time. Worldwide the confirmed 
case count has passed 16 million, although experts believe that figure is vastly short of the true number. One study 
in New Delhi found a quarter of people tested had contracted the virus, amounting to 4.7 million in the Indian capital 
alone. China – where the coronavirus was first reported in December last year – recorded 61 cases on Monday, the 
highest daily figure since April.
----------
It could take half a decade for a key measure of the UK's economy to get back to where it was before the onset of 
coronavirus, new figures have suggested. Experts at big four consultancy Ernst & Young Global said that they 
expect gross domestic product to remain below where it was in 2019 until 2024, dealing a blow to hopes of a rapid 
recovery. The consultancy's experts believe that GDP will contract by 12% this year in the UK, well worse than the 
8% they predicted just a month ago. It will then bounce back to notch up 6.5% growth in 2021. Howard Archer, chief 
economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: "Even though lockdown restrictions are easing, consumer caution has 
been much more pronounced than expected."

AstraZeneca said it has entered into a multi-billion dollar oncology collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. The two will 
work on Daiichi Sankyo's proprietary trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody drug conjugate 
and potential new medicine for the treatment of multiple tumour types. "DS-1062 is currently in development for the 
treatment of multiple tumours that commonly express the cell-surface glycoprotein TROP2. Among them, TROP2 is 
overexpressed in the majority of non-small cell lung cancers and breast cancers tumour types that have long been 
a strategic focus for AstraZeneca," the London-listed pharmaceutical firm said. The companies will jointly develop 
and commercialise DS-1062 worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights. 
AstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo USD1 billion upfront in staged payments, with USD350 million due on 
completion, USD325 million after a year and USD325 million after two years. AstraZeneca will pay additional 
conditional amounts of up to USD1 billion for the successful achievement of regulatory approvals and up to USD4 
billion for sales-related milestones. AstraZeneca added that the transaction does not impact its financial guidance 
for 2020.

London-based lender HSBC Holdings denied Chinese media reports that it had "framed" telecom giant Huawei or 
"fabricated evidence" that led to the arrest of a top company official. Washington's investigations into Huawei – for 
allegedly violating US sanctions on Iran – started before the bank's involvement with the company in late 2016, the 
lender said Saturday in its first public comments on Huawei's legal battle in North America. "HSBC has no malice 
against Huawei, nor has it framed Huawei," the bank said in a statement posted on the Chinese messaging app 
WeChat. "HSBC has not fabricated evidence or concealed facts, nor will it distort facts or harm any customers for 
our own benefit." The HSBC statement came a day after Chinese state media, including the communist party 
mouthpiece People's Daily, published reports accusing HSBC of lying about Huawei during an investigation by the 
US department of justice. The probe led to Canada arresting Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in 
December 2018.

COMPANIES - FTSE 250

Data and analytics company Ascential said it produced a "resilient" performance in the first half against a 
challenging backdrop. Revenue slumped to GBP144.3 million from GBP236.2 million, down 39%. Marketing 
segment revenue slumped 74%, primarily due to the cancellation of the 2020 edition of Cannes Lions. Ascential 
swung to a pretax loss of GBP78.3 million from a GBP30.5 million profit a year ago. Looking ahead, the company 
said: "Clearly, the impact on our business in 2020 from Covid-19 has been significant. While we do not expect an 
immediate recovery in underlying trading conditions it is also apparent that a number of our brands remain well 
positioned, arguably more so than six months ago, to benefit from the accelerated shift towards e-commerce that 
we have witnessed, particularly clearly, in the past period."
----------
Signature Aviation reported a like-for-like sales decline of 31% in the first half "solely due to the impact of Covid-19". 
The aviation support services provider said revenue for the continuing group was down 38% in the six months to 
June. Flying activity continues to show an improving trend, said Signature Aviation, with activity down just 32% in 
June versus an average of 77% in April. "All guidance remains suspended. We will continue to monitor the Covid-
19 recovery closely and will provide further updates when we publish our interim results in early September. 
Furthermore, the board will review the decision on suspension of dividend payments as trading conditions become 
clearer," said Signature Aviation. The company added that it has secured a covenant waiver from lenders for the 
testing periods ending December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021.
----------
COMPANIES - GLOBAL
----------
Enterprise software provider SAP saidprofit almost quadrupled in the first half of 2020, thanks to an increase in 
revenue and lower operating expenses. The Walldorf, Germany-based company reported revenue growth of 4% in 
the six months to the end of June to EUR13.26 billion from EUR12.72 billion generated a year earlier. Operating 
profit jumped to EUR2.49 billion from EUR691 million year-on-year, thanks to a cost reduction initiative. SAP said 
its operating expenses decreased by 10% to EUR10.77 billion, mainly driven by a reduction in restructuring 
expenses, and share-based compensation. Pretax profit surged to EUR2.44 billion from EUR675 million a year 
LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair Expect 60% Drop In Passengers In Current Year
earlier. Revenue improvement resulted primarily from an increase in SAP's cloud business, it said, where revenue 
was EUR4.01 billion in the first half, an increase of 25% compared to the same period in 2019.

US economic stimulus measures outweigh jitters caused by new virus clusters in China. 
"As we start the new trading week equity markets in Asia have undergone a somewhat mixed start to the week, with 
reports of fresh Covid-19 outbreaks across Asia, with markets here in Europe set for a mildly positive start, as 
investors mull the prospect of another US stimulus program to replace the one that is set to expire at the end of this 
week," said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
Meanwhile, the dollar slumped at the start of the week, helping gold smash its 2011 record price.
In early UK company news, AstraZeneca has entered into an oncology collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo worth up 
to USD6 billion, while both Ryanair and Ascential reported swings to loss. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open just 0.18 of a point higher at 6,126.80 on 
Monday. The FTSE 100 index closed down 87.62 points, or 1.4%, at 6,123.82 on Friday.
The slightly higher start in Europe follows mixed trade in Asia overnight after China recorded 61 new coronavirus 
cases on Monday – the highest daily figure since April – propelled by clusters in three separate regions that have 
sparked fears of a fresh wave.
The bulk of 57 new domestic cases were found in the far northwestern Xinjiang region, according to the National 
Health Commission, where a sudden outbreak in the regional capital of Urumqi occurred in mid-July.
Fourteen domestic cases were also recorded in the northeastern province of Liaoning where a fresh cluster broke 
out in the city of Dalian last week. Two more local cases were found in the neighbouring province of Jilin near the 
North Korean border – the first since late May. The last four infections confirmed on Monday were imported from 
overseas.

It is the highest daily tally of new virus cases since April 14, when 89 cases, mostly imported, were recorded.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.2%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.1%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.4%.  
Providing a reason to be upbeat at the start of the week, though, was progress on some fresh US stimulus. 
US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the White House and Republicans in Congress will finally introduce 
their proposal for a new stimulus bill on Monday, as major protections to help cushion the blow from the pandemic 
are expiring.
Already, a ban on housing evictions at the federal level ended last week, and enhanced unemployment benefits are 
effectively finished this weekend, meaning whatever comes in the future will already be too late for out-of-work 
people relying on government assistance. Support for small businesses, a lifeline to keep people connected to their 
jobs, wraps up in early August.
"The bill will be introduced Monday and we're prepared to act quickly," Mnuchin told broadcaster Fox on Sunday.
However, Republican leaders in Congress have suggested the negotiations with Democrats on a final bill may take 
weeks, with economists warning the damage from delays will be significant.
Republicans say their bill is worth about USD1 trillion and would see at least a 30% decline in federal 
unemployment benefits. Congress in March passed stimulus bills which together with a later supplement were 
worth nearly USD3 trillion. Democrats want another USD3 trillion in stimulus, something Republicans have rejected 
out of hand, saying it is too costly.
In the US on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 182.44 points, or 0.7%, at 26,469.89. The S&P 
500 closed down 20.03 points, or 0.6%, at 3,215.63 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 98.24 points, or 0.9%, to 
10,363.18.
The dollar was sharply lower across the board early Monday. Sterling was quoted at USD1.2823 early Monday, 
higher than USD1.2786 at the London equities close on Friday.
The euro traded at USD1.1705 early Monday, higher than USD1.1635 late Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was 
quoted at JPY105.56, down versus JPY105.85.
"Currency markets appear to be girding themselves for another notable leg lower by the US dollar. With geopolitics 
the new normal, it seems to fall of the radar as fast as it appears and thankfully so. With a new US stimulus 
package, a European one, an ultra-dovish Federal Reserve, and China leading Asian recovery hopes, more losses 
for the US Dollar across the board are set to continue," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at 
Oanda.
The greenback's fall also helped to boost gold prices to record levels. 
Gold was quoted at USD1,932.27 an ounce early Monday, higher than USD1,900.17 on Friday. The precious metal 
hit a record high of USD1,944.36 an ounce overnight.
Brent oil was trading at USD43.06 a barrel early Monday, higher than USD43.06 late Friday.
In early London news, AstraZeneca said it has entered into a multi-billion dollar oncology collaboration with Daiichi 
Sankyo.
The two will work on Daiichi Sankyo's proprietary trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody drug 
conjugate and potential new medicine for the treatment of multiple tumour types.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Astra And Daiichi Enter Oncology Collaboration
"DS-1062 is currently in development for the treatment of multiple tumours that commonly express the cell-surface 
glycoprotein TROP2. Among them, TROP2 is overexpressed in the majority of non-small cell lung cancers and 
breast cancers tumour types that have long been a strategic focus for AstraZeneca," the London-listed 
pharmaceutical firm said.
The companies will jointly develop and commercialise DS-1062 worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo 
will maintain exclusive rights. 
AstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo USD1 billion upfront in staged payments, with USD350 million due on 
completion, USD325 million after a year and USD325 million after two years. AstraZeneca will pay additional 
conditional amounts of up to USD1 billion for the successful achievement of regulatory approvals and up to USD4 
billion for sales-related milestones.
AstraZeneca added that the transaction does not impact its financial guidance for 2020.
"We see significant potential in this antibody drug conjugate in lung as well as in breast and other cancers that 
commonly express TROP2. We are delighted to enter this new collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo and to build on the 
successful launch of Enhertu to further expand our pipeline and leadership in Oncology," said AstraZencea Chief 
Executive Pascal Soriot. 
In a separate release, AstraZeneca said its Imfinzi drug has been recommended for marketing authorisation in the 
EU for the first-line treatment of adults with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. 
Ryanair turned to a loss in the first quarter due to travel restrictions put in place because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The budget airline swung to a loss of GBP185 million in the first quarter ended June 30 from a net profit of GBP243 
million a year ago.
The company saw 99% of its fleet grounded from mid-March to the end of June due to travel restrictions caused by 
Covid-19. First quarter air traffic fell to 500,000 passengers from 42.0 million a year before.
"The past quarter was the most challenging in Ryanair's 35 year history. Covid-19 grounded the group's fleet for 
almost 4 months as EU governments imposed flight or travel bans and widespread population lockdowns," Ryanair 
said.
Data and analytics company Ascential said it produced a "resilient" performance in the first half against a 
challenging backdrop. 
Revenue slumped to GBP144.3 million from GBP236.2 million, down 39%. Marketing segment revenue slumped 
74%, primarily due to the cancellation of the 2020 edition of Cannes Lions.
Ascential swung to a pretax loss of GBP78.3 million from a GBP30.5 million profit a year ago. 
Looking ahead, the FTSE 250 firm said: "Clearly, the impact on our business in 2020 from Covid-19 has been 
significant. While we do not expect an immediate recovery in underlying trading conditions it is also apparent that a 
number of our brands remain well positioned, arguably more so than six months ago, to benefit from the 
accelerated shift towards eCommerce that we have witnessed, particularly clearly, in the past period."
Signature Aviation reported a like-for-like sales decline of 31% in the first half "solely due to the impact of Covid-19".
The aviation support services provider said revenue for the continuing group was down 38% in the six months to 
June. 
Flying activity continues to show an improving trend, said Signature Aviation, with activity down just 32% in June 
versus an average of 77% in April.

"All guidance remains suspended. We will continue to monitor the Covid-19 recovery closely and will provide further 
updates when we publish our interim results in early September. Furthermore, the board will review the decision on 
suspension of dividend payments as trading conditions become clearer," said Signature Aviation.
The company added that it has secured a covenant waiver from lenders for the testing periods ending December 
31, 2020 and June 30, 2021.
The economic calendar on Monday is fairly light, with the Ifo's German business climate index at 0900 BST and US 
durable goods orders at 1330 BST.
The focus of next week will be the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision on Wednesday, while second 
quarter GDP readings on Thursday from Germany and the US also will be eyed, followed by the same from the 
eurozone on Friday.

COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings turned to a loss in the first quarter due to travel restrictions put in place because of the Covid-19 
pandemic. The budget airline swung to a loss of GBP185 million in the first quarter ended June 30 from a net profit 
of GBP243 million a year ago. The company saw 99% of its fleet grounded from mid-March to the end of June due 
to travel restrictions caused by Covid-19. Passengers fell to 500,000 in the quarter from 41.9 million a year ago. 
"The past quarter was the most challenging in Ryanair's 35 year history. Covid-19 grounded the group's fleet for 
almost 4 months as EU governments imposed flight or travel bans and widespread population lockdowns," Ryanair 
said. Ryanair implemented an 85% reduction in costs during the quarter which it said was not enough to offset the 
heavy revenue losses. "It is impossible to predict how long the Covid-19 pandemic will persist, and a 2nd wave of 
Covid-19 cases across Europe in late autumn (when the annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right 
now," said Ryanair.
----------
AstraZeneca said it has entered into an oncology collaboration worth up to GBP6 billion with Daiichi Sankyo Co, as 
Astra also announced that Calquence and Imfinzi have been recommended for approval in the EU. The FTSE 100 
drug manufacturer said it has inked a global development and commercialisation agreement with Japanese peer 
Daiichi. The partnership will see both companies work on Daiichi Sankyo's proprietary trophoblast cell-surface 
antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed antibody drug conjugate and potential new medicine for the treatment of multiple

Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights. AstraZeneca will pay Daiichi Sankyo USD1 billion upfront in staged

Moody's Investors Service downgraded the long-term senior unsecured rating of Rolls-Royce Holdings to Ba2 from 
Baa3, while keeping the outlook on the rating negative. Moody's also assigned a corporate family rating of Ba2 and 
Ba2-PD probability of default rating to the aircraft engine manufacturer. The ratings agency explained that the 
action reflects its expectations of "substantial" cash outflows in 2020 and 2021, resulting in "materially" increased 
leverage. Rolls-Royce has incurred a free cash outflow of GBP3 billion in the first half of 2020 and expects an 
outflow of GBP4 billion for the full year. Moody's highlighted that FTSE 100-listed Rolls-Royce has been hurt by the 
coronavirus pandemic as a result of reduced flying hours by airlines. This will result in lower aftermarket revenue for 
Rolls-Royce, and lower demand for new commercial aircraft.
----------
MARKETS
----------
Sentiment was subdued at the start of the week as a handful of virus clusters in China sparked worries of a second 
wave. Amid Monday's caution and a weaker dollar, gold prices surged to a fresh record, surpassing the highs of 
2011. In London, travel stocks were lower after the UK decided to reimpose strict quarantine rules on travellers 
coming from Spain. Stocks in the US are pointed to a higher start on Monday, shaking off Europe's gloom - the Dow 
Jones is called up 0.3%, the S&P 500 also up 0.3% and the Nasdaq up 0.6%. 
----------
FTSE 100: down 0.1% at 6,117.22
FTSE 250: down 0.5% at 17,171.40
AIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.3% at 886.26

(changes since previous London equities close)

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Business sentiment in Germany improved further in July, figures from the Ifo Institute showed. The Ifo's business 
climate index rose to 90.5 points in July from 86.3 in June. The latest reading is the highest since February when 
the index recorded 95.8 before dipping to a low of 74.3 in April after the Covid-19 crisis struck. "This is the third rise 
in a row," the Ifo noted of July's figure. "Companies were notably more satisfied with their current business 
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair 's "Biggest Fear" Is Second Wave In Autumn
situation. They are also carefully optimistic about the coming months. The German economy is recovering step by 
step." The situation index rose to 84.5 points from 81.3 in June, while the expectations index climbed to 97.0 in July 
from 91.6 in June, well off April's low of 69.6. By sector, manufacturing saw another solid improvement, to minus 12 
from minus 22.7. The index monitoring the service sector tipped into positive territory for the first time since 
February, at 2.0 in July from minus 6.0 in June.
----------
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has doubled down on the UK's sudden decision to reimpose strict quarantine rules 
at short notice on travellers returning from Spain, calling the measures "absolutely necessary". But Spain said it 
was in conversation with the UK about exempting the Canary and Balearic islands, which includes Ibiza and 
Mallorca, from the requirement to self-isolate for two weeks. Foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya argued Spain 
had coronavirus outbreaks "perfectly controlled" after the European country recorded more than 900 fresh daily 
Covid-19 cases for two days running. Ministers announced on Saturday that holidaymakers who had not returned 
from Spain and its islands by midnight would be forced to quarantine for 14 days after Covid-19 second wave fears 
saw the popular holiday destination struck off the UK's safe list. The Foreign Office guidance advising against all 
but essential travel to mainland Spain does not include the islands but ministers opted to apply blanket quarantine 
arrangements across the Spanish territories.
----------
It could take half a decade for a key measure of the UK's economy to get back to where it was before the onset of 
coronavirus, new figures have suggested. Experts at big four consultancy EY said that they expect gross domestic 
product to remain below where it was in 2019 until 2024, dealing a blow to hopes of a rapid recovery. The 
consultancy's experts believe that GDP will contract by 11.5% this year in the UK, well worse than the 8% they 
predicted just a month ago. It will then bounce back to notch up 6.5% growth in 2021. Howard Archer, chief 
economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: "Even though lockdown restrictions are easing, consumer caution has 
been much more pronounced than expected. We believe that consumer confidence is one of three key factors likely 
to weigh on the UK economy over the rest of the year, alongside the impact of rising unemployment and low levels 
of business investment."
----------
Chinese authorities took over the US consulate in Chengdu on Monday, the foreign ministry said, days after Beijing 
ordered it to close in retaliation for the shuttering of its mission in Houston. Earlier in the morning state broadcaster 
CCTV showed footage of the American flag being lowered, after diplomatic tensions soared between the two 
powers with both alleging the other had endangered national security. Beijing later confirmed the consulate had 
closed at 0200 GMT. "Afterwards, Chinese authorities entered through the front entrance and took it over," the 
foreign ministry said in a statement. Relations deteriorated in recent weeks in a Cold War-style standoff, with the 
Chengdu mission Friday ordered to shut in retaliation for the forced closure of Beijing's consulate in Houston, 
Texas.
----------
The US has doubled its investment – to nearly USD1 billion – to expedite development of a potential Covid-19 
vaccine by American firm Moderna, which on Monday begins the decisive final phase of clinical trials. The 
government now plans to spend up to USD472 million on top of the previously announced USD483 million, the 
Moderna biotechnology company announced Sunday. Moderna said the added investment was justified by its 
decision, in conjunction with the government, to "significantly" expand a phase three clinical trial of a candidate 
vaccine to include 30,000 participants. In a small, initial trial, Moderna's experimental vaccine produced coronavirus 
antibodies – which should help fend off the disease – in the bodies of all 45 participants. In the expanded trial 
starting Monday, half the 30,000 participants will receive a 100-microgram dose of the vaccine, while the rest will be 
given a placebo.

UPDATE: Call For Smarter Border Checks After UK Restricts Spain Travel

(Alliance News) - The government has been urged to introduce "smarter measures" at the border after 
holidaymakers in Spain were told they must quarantine when they return home.
Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said there are "serious questions" about the blanket self-
isolation requirement.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The first is why we are still employing the… blunt tool of the 14-day 
quarantining rather than smarter measures, and secondly the chaotic nature of the decision-making which certainly 
hasn't bred confidence in the government's approach."
Thomas-Symonds added: "I think you need a smarter set of quarantine measures at the airport. I've suggested this 
test, trace and isolate regime but you can also have temperature checking and other things – you look at a range of 
measures."
Spain has been removed from the UK's list of safe destinations after it saw a spike in the number of coronavirus 
cases.
The decision was announced on Saturday night, less than five hours before it came into force.
Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK & Ireland, part of TUI AG, called for a "more nuanced policy" to 
include rules based on regions as well as countries.
He noted that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is not advising against non-essential travel to Spain's Balearic 
Islands, but the quarantine requirement covers arrivals from both mainland Spain and its islands.
UPDATE: Call For Smarter Border Checks After UK Restricts Spain Travel
Speaking to Sky News, Flintham said: "If the Balearics are still OK to go to – and clearly the travel advice says you 
can travel – should we have a different quarantine or no quarantine for those and not lump it all together, as in one 
big total Spain quarantine?
"We're really after a little bit of a nuance because, being honest, going forward, with something like the US, it could 
be there's a problem in Florida but not in California, and you wouldn't want to close the whole of the US to tourists."
TUI has cancelled all holidays to mainland Spain up to and including August 9.
TUI shares were down 12% in London on Thursday, while airlines such as International Consolidated Airlines 
Group SA, Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC were down 7.5%, 4.3% and 11%, respectively.
The government's decision to reimpose restrictions on Spain left holidaymakers frustrated, with some saying they 
would not have travelled if they knew they would have to spend a fortnight self-isolating afterwards.
Close to 1.8 million holidays were likely to have been thrown into chaos by the move, according to travel company 
The PC Agency, which analysed the number of seats booked on flights leaving the UK for Spain between July 26 
and August 31.
There are fears more European holidays could be thrown into disarray.
The Telegraph reported that officials in both France and Germany have warned of possible new lockdowns as parts 
of Europe braced for a second wave of Covid-19 infections.
French health authorities said at the weekend that the country's R-rate was up to 1.3 and that daily new infections 
on Friday had risen to 1,130 – indicators resembling those seen in May, when France was coming out of its strict 
two-month lockdown.
Health minister Helen Whately said so-called air bridges to other countries are constantly "under review".
She told Today: "What we said throughout the time when we've put in place the policy on the travel corridors, the air 
bridges, is that we would need to keep those under review, that we would need to monitor the rates in other 
countries.
"That is exactly what we've done in Spain, so we are enacting the policy that we committed to doing.
"The rate was going up very rapidly in Spain and we had to take very rapid, decisive action."
Meanwhile, beauty salons and tattoo parlours are among the businesses which can reopen in Wales from Monday, 
but people are warned about the risks of offering eyebrow treatments and facials due to prolonged face-to-face 
contact.

(Alliance News) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC plans to close its Frankfurt-Hahn base in Germany – 
and other hubs could follow after German pilots voted against pay cuts, it emerged on Wednesday.
Ryanair, which is seeking to axe 3,000 jobs due to a coronavirus-induced collapse in travel demand, revealed its 
plan in a memo sent on Tuesday to Germany-based pilots.
The Dublin-based carrier blamed their trade union VC, whose members voted in favour of rejecting its proposed 
20% pay cut over four years.
"VC wrote to us... (on Monday) confirming that, following a ballot of members, this emergency agreement on cost 
savings and job protection was rejected since only 49.4% voted in favour," Ryanair said in the memo obtained by 
AFP on Wednesday.
It added: "The VC (has) voted for job cuts and base closures when they could have preserved all jobs.
"We must move on with alternative measures to deliver cost savings, which regrettably will mean base closures and 
dismissals."
Ryanair added that its Frankfurt-Hahn hub, some 120 kilometreswest of Germany's financial capital, would close 
with effect from November 1, but did not specify the number of job losses.
The carrier also warned its bases in Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf were likely to be closed before winter.
In reaction, the VC union said the proposed cutbacks would harm members and offer inadequate job security – and 
it urged fresh talks.
"We are not giving up hope. The employer would be well advised to quickly get back to the negotiating table now," 
VC added in a statement.

In contrast earlier this month, Ryanair's British pilots agreed 20% pay cuts to save 260 jobs that the airline had 
wanted to axe. 
Ryanair's four divisions comprise its main Irish operations, Austrian-based Lauda, Polish unit Buzz, and Malta Air.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC will shutter its base at Frankfurt Hahn Airport and is 
considering doing the same in Berlin Tegel and Weeze Airport near the Dutch border, Ryanair division Malta Air 
said in an internal memo seen by dpa on Tuesday.
The move comes after majority of German pilots voted against a proposed deal of savings including paycuts that 
Ryanair said were required because of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
"We must move on to deliver savings in other ways and adjust our German operations to tackle the unsustainable 
cost base at our German airports," the Malta Air memo said.
German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit said late Tuesday that as many as 170 pilots could be affected by the 
decision, adding that negotiations with the airline had not been concluded.
The airline's British-based pilots accepted pay cuts of up to 20% on July 8, with a similar deal announced in Ireland 
five days earlier.
Last week Ryanair announced it would cut "up to 1,000 flights" between Ireland and Britain during August and 
September, blaming the Irish government for its requirement that arrivals self-isolate for 14 days.
Described as Europe's largest airline, Ireland's Ryanair said in May that it would cut 3,000 jobs due to the 
pandemic, which has brought international travel to a near-standstill.
The virus has infected almost 15 million people and killed over 610,000, according to official figures collated by 
Johns Hopkins University.

(Alliance News) - Budget carrier Lauda is giving up its German hub in Stuttgart and will terminate the contracts of all 
employees there after a majority of pilots opposed wage reductions, according to a company document obtained by 
dpa on Thursday.
The loss-making subsidiary of Irish-based Ryanair Holdings PLC plans to close this base after the summer travel 
season on October 30.
While nearly all co-pilots and flight attendants in Stuttgart had agreed to a new collective labour contract that was 
drawn up in reaction to the pandemic-related aviation crisis, less than half of the captains gave their approval, the 
document said.
"Since there are no positions available elsewhere, we will not be able to offer any crew transfers" to other hubs, 
Lauda's Vienna-based management said in the paper that was initially made public by Austrian newspaper Der 
Standard.
A negotiator for the German labour union Verdi, Sven Bergelin, said Lauda would hopefully reconsider and would 
enter into talks to save jobs.
"Pilots and cabin crews want to be treated fairly and want to continue their work under acceptable standards," he 
said in a statement.
While Stuttgart is to be shuttered, a majority of pilots, co-pilots and flight attendants have accepted wage cuts in 
Lauda's other German base in Dusseldorf. Those who did not agree face possible lay-offs, according to Verdi.
Ryanair and Lauda's management had also threatened to lay off all staff in Vienna, but employees there agreed to 
a new wage deal in early June after Austrian unionists had managed to negotiate better conditions.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it would cut its Ireland-UK schedules for the months of 
August and September by up to 1,000 flights, with the loss of over 200,000 passengers.
The move comes as Ireland maintains a defective quarantine restriction on EU visitors even as the UK and 
Northern Ireland last week opened up air bridges to most EU countries.
The Irish budget airline said Ireland accounts for less than 8% of its traffic. The country's tourism industry and 
connectivity for Irish workers commuting particularly to and from the UK is now suffering unrecoverable losses, as 
arriving EU passengers are forced to quarantine even while the border to Northern Ireland remains wide open with 
no such quarantines.
"It makes no sense, when governments all over Europe have opened up EU flights since June 1 and removed 
travel restrictions on intra-EU travel, that the Irish government continues to treat countries like Germany, Denmark 
and Greece as if they were suffering similar levels of Covid as the USA, Brazil and India," a Ryanair spokesperson 
said. 
"Air travel between Ireland and the UK is being badly damaged by this ineffective 14 day quarantine. Ryanair will 
significantly reduce its flights between Ireland and the UK in August and September, to reflect this suppressed 
demand," the spokesperson added. 
Ryanair shares were trading 0.1% higher in London on Tuesday at EUR10.76 each.

The financing will come in the form of a GBP200 million injection from Branson himself and a GBP170 million loan 
from hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, Sky News explained. 
Virgin Atlantic also secured hundreds of millions of extra cash from other payment deferrals. 
The carrier's two largest shareholders, Virgin Group and Delta Air Lines Inc, will defer GBP400 million in fees 
between them and Virgin Atlantic Chief Executive Shai Weiss has spotted GBP200 million in cost savings. 
The GBP1.2 billion package also includes the backing of a subsidiary of financial services technology firm Fiserv 
Inc.

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a troubling time for airline companies across the world, as lockdown measures 
batter demand and empty skies. 
Virgin Atlantic investee Flybe, which aviation, energy, and civil engineering firm Stobart Group Ltd also had a stake 
in, collapsed into administration in March due to the virus crisis. 
In May, Virgin Atlantic said it will axe over 3,000 jobs and move its operations from London's Gatwick airport to 
Heathrow, as part of measures to "reshape and resize" the business.

Similarly, International Consolidated Airlines SA-owned British Airways has begun consultation on up to 12,000 
redundancies, while Ryanair Holdings PLC has decided to cut 3,000 jobs.

(Alliance News) - FTSE 250-listed easyJet PLC pilots have called for a vote of no confidence in the airline's Chief 
Operating Officer Peter Bellew, saying morale has "collapsed", British Airline Pilots Association said on Monday.
The move follows the budget airline's notification of 727 UK pilot redundancies and that easyJet would be closing 
their bases at Newcastle, Southend and Stansted.
BALPA said pilots have demanded a "vote of no confidence" in COO Bellew, who joined easyJet in January from 
Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC. 
BALPA, which represents over 90% of easyJet pilots, will therefore be carrying out a secret ballot this week closing 
at noon on Friday. 
"This is an unusual if not unique step for BALPA to take as we prefer to do our business around the negotiating 
table but pilot morale in easyJet has collapsed and we’ve been inundated with calls for a vote of no confidence in 
Bellew," BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton, said.
"I think easyJet is in a serious industrial relations mess and needs to start winning the hearts and minds of its pilots 
and other staff before it's too late," added Strutton.
easyJet shares closed 0.1% lower on Monday at 663.40 pence each in London.

(Alliance News) -  The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices on Monday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Fresnillo, up 3.5%, Polymetal International, up 1.5%. The gold miners were tracking spot gold prices higher quoted 
at USD1,808.12 an ounce Monday morning from USD1,801.62 late Friday. "The gold price is consolidating above 
USD1,800 with bullion holding onto this significant threshold despite stocks in green. This confirms investors' huge 
appetite for the yellow metal in this uncertain phase on markets. Technically, apart from the psychological level of 
USD1,800, we can see a first support at USD1,790. As long as the price remains above this level, the bullish 
movement will continue, pulling up the price to new highs," said analysts at ActivTrades.
----------
Legal & General, up 1.1%. Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised the insurer to Buy from Neutral.

FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
G4S, up 9.5%. The outsourcer said earnings for the first six months of 2020 will be "significantly" above market 
consensus following a "resilient" trading performance in June. According to the company, analysts' average 
forecast for first-half adjusted profit before interest, tax and amortisation is GBP159 million and adjusted earnings 
per share of 4.3 pence. In the first half of 2019, G4S recorded adjusted Pbita of GBP234 million and adjusted EPS

of 3.8p. As a consequence of the strong first-half performance, the FTSE 250-listed company has decided to bring 
forward its first-half results announcement to the week commencing July 20.
----------
Carnival, up 3.5%. The cruise line operator late Friday said it swung to an interim loss as its operations halted due 
to the coronavirus pandemic, but painted an optimistic picture for investors which including restarting operations in 
August. The Miami-based cruise ship operator expects to resume guest operations in August with its AIDA cruise 
business first from three German ports as previously announced.
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Ryanair Holdings, up 4.0%. JPMorgan raised the Irish carrier to Overweight from Neutral.
----------
Novacyt, up 3.5%. The Anglo-French clinical diagnostics group said revenue for the first half of 2020 rose tenfold, 
due to strong demand for its molecular test for Covid-19 since its launch back in January and a distribution 
agreement signed in the US. The company said revenue for the six months to the end of June was EUR72.4 
million, multiplying from just EUR7.2 million a year before. For the month of June alone, sales of its Covid-19 test 
totalled EUR25.4 million, reflecting consecutive months of growth. As a result of this, Novacyt estimates its interim 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to be more than EUR45 million. This is compared to just 
EUR153,000 in the first half of 2019. During the period, the group signed a distribution agreement for the Covid-19 
test in the US, a region which is already delivering significant sales growth for Novacyt.

OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS

Boohoo Group, down 15%. Aberdeen Standard Investments has sold most of its shareholding in online clothing 
retailer over allegations of poor working conditions in its supply chain, the Times newspaper reported Friday. 
According to the newspaper, asset manager Aberdeen Standard Investments has sold 27 million shares, equivalent 
to two-thirds of its stake. The Sunday Times newspaper reported allegations that workers in Leicester's Jaswal 
Fashions factory making clothes for Boohoo brand Nasty Gal were being paid as little as GBP3.50 an hour and 
operating without social distancing measures in place. Boohoo, in response, on Wednesday last week again had 
distanced itself from Jaswal Fashions and had said that while it has seen "non-compliance" with its code of conduct, 
it has not seen evidence of its suppliers paying workers GBP3.50 per hour. It also had launched an independent 
review of its UK supply chain. Boohoo shares have dropped 42% from their 2020 peak in June.
----------
Quiz, down 5.5%. The fashion retailer said it is investigating a Leicester-based supplier which is alleged to have 
paid staff as little as GBP3 an hour. The Times on Saturday reported that an undercover journalist was told by 
bosses at the factory that she must perform two days of unpaid work before even advancing to the GBP3 per hour 
rate. The fashion brand said it believes that one of its Leicester-based suppliers has used a subcontractor at the 
centre of allegations over breaches to the UK National Living Wage. The living wage is GBP8.72 for someone over 
the age of 25. Quiz said it would terminate its relationships with suppliers that do not live up to its code of practice.

Deal Struck To Avert Cabin Crew Job Losses At Ryanair, Unite Says

(Alliance News) - A union has announced an agreement with Ryanair Holdings PLC which it says will result in no 
job losses among cabin crew at the airline.
Unite hailed the airline's "constructive" approach as being in direct contrast to other employers in the aviation 
sector.
The union said it had been in talks with Ryanair since it announced job cuts in May as a result of the coronavirus 
crisis.
As part of the negotiations Unite said it has agreed that workers will have a temporary pay cut of 5% for the lowest 
paid, 7.5% for others, and 10% for the highest paid.
The pay cuts will be returned in two tranches in 2023 and 2024, or earlier if Ryanair returns to pre-Covid levels of 
business sooner, said Unite.
Unite members employed at Ryanair have been balloted on the agreement and have voted to accept the pay 
reductions in order to preserve jobs, the union announced.
Unite assistant general secretary Diana Holland said: "Unite has been contending with an incredibly difficult set of 
circumstances in the aviation sector.
"The agreement with Ryanair shows that the company has taken a more constructive and less damaging approach 
to dealing with the issues than many of its competitor airlines."
The union's national aviation officer Oliver Richardson said: "That these reductions are temporary and tiered to 
ensure the lowest paid are least affected was an important outcome of our negotiations and critical to our members 
voting to accept the proposals.
Deal Struck To Avert Cabin Crew Job Losses At Ryanair , Unite Says
"Unite has always maintained that temporary problems require temporary solutions. Ryanair's management have 
shown that it is possible to reach an agreement on exactly that basis.
"It is always difficult for members to accept reductions in pay but in order to preserve jobs it is exactly what our 
cabin crew have agreed to do."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said its Irish pilots have accepted a four-year agreement 
including a 20% pay cut restored over four years, while its UK and Ireland cabin crew have accepted a 10% cut.
The agreement also includes "productivity improvements on rosters" as well as "flexible working patterns and 
annual leave" with the aim of minimising job losses for Irish pilots.
Budget airline Ryanair, which has its headquarters in Swords near Dublin said the deal gives the company "a 
framework to flex its operation" while the Covid-19 pandemic remains ongoing as well as offering "a pathway to 
recovery" once normality returns.
BALPA and Ryanair UK agreed a similar deal earlier in the week that also included a 20% pay cut and 
improvements to productivity.
Alongside this, Ryanair also signed agreements with the Forsa union concerning Irish based cabin crew and the 
UNITE union for its UK cabin crew including pay reductions of up to 10%. These cuts are also to be fully restored 
over four years with the agreement also including productivity improvements.
The cabin crew agreements are out to ballot at present.
Ryanair said the new agreements demonstrate a willingness on the part of its plots to work with the airline during 
the pandemic where Ryanair is to carry 50% less traffic and take in "significantly lower fares for the foreseeable 
future".
Chief Executive Eddie Wilson said: "We welcome this week's results in both Ireland and the UK of acceptance of a 
4-year agreement on 20% pay cuts and productivity improvements on rosters and flexible working patterns to save 
the maximum number of Irish and UK pilot jobs. The strength of this acceptance demonstrates the commitment

from our pilots in Ireland and the UK to work with Ryanair as we work our way through this crisis over the next 
number of years."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair said Friday it has reached agreement with its Irish pilots on a four-year deal that reduces 
pay by 20%, though this is restored over the four years.
The Irish labour accord follows a similar one with UK pilots earlier this week and includes productivity improvements 
and flexible working patterns.
"This agreement gives Ryanair a framework to flex its operation during the Covid-19 crisis and a pathway to 
recovery when the business returns to normal in the years ahead," the Irish budget carrier said.
It also has reached agreement with Irish and UK based cabin crew for 10% pay reductions, also restored over four 
years.
"We welcome this week's results in both Ireland and the UK of acceptance of a 4-year agreement on 20% pay cuts 
and productivity improvements on rosters and flexible working patterns to save the maximum number of Irish and 
UK pilot jobs," said Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wilson.
On Thursday, Ryanair had reported its traffic in June dropped by 97% to 400,000 passengers versus the 14.2 
million passengers it carried a year earlier. It operated just 2,800 scheduled flights in June versus its budgeted 
schedule of 79,600.

English holidaymakers can embark on overseas trips from Saturday as quarantine restrictions are lifted and travel 
advice is updated, PA reports. The 14-day self-isolation policy for people returning to or visiting England from 
destinations such as Spain, France, Italy and Germany is being lifted, the Department for Transport announced. 
Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office will exempt a number of countries from its advisory against all 
non-essential travel, which has been in place since March 17 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The change in 
travel advice comes into force on Saturday, while the quarantine policy will be amended from July 10. That means 
people who depart on Saturday and spend at least six days in certain locations will not need to self-isolate on their 
return. A full list of the countries deemed to pose "a reduced risk to the public health of UK citizens" will be 
published later on Friday.

Fragile consumer confidence is showing some signs of improving as many businesses prepare to open their doors 
again, according to an index. The findings could bring more hope to high streets as some businesses such as pubs 
and hairdressers prepare to reopen this weekend. While the overall mood remains downbeat, it is less negative 
than a couple of weeks earlier, GfK's Covid-19 "flash report" found. The index measures people's attitudes towards 
their households' personal finances, the wider economy and how consumers feel about splashing out on major 
purchases. The latest data, gathered between June 18 and 26, produced an overall score of minus 27. While this 
was still a negative score, it marked an improvement compared with a score of minus 30 in a previous survey 
carried out from June 1 to 11.

Land Securities noted it has only collected 60% of the net rent due on June 24 compared with 94% for the 
equivalent period last year. Landsec said GBP122 million of rent was due on June 24. "Covid-19 has resulted in 
some customers taking longer to pay their rent and we continue to have supportive and constructive dialogue with 
our customers," the company added. It noted 75% of the rent due on March 25 has now been received, with GBP30 
million outstanding. As of June 30, 79% of Landsec's retail units were trading and 16 of its 18 leisure parks were 
open. "In line with government guidance, our shopping centres, outlets and retail parks are open, with encouraging 
levels of footfall," the company said. Landsec noted it remains in a financially "robust" position. At June 30, its

Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia is expected to see a 21 to 29 month delay for first production, which will 
increase the development capital needed for the project by between USD1.3 billion to USD1.8 billion from the 
original USD5.3 billion. The updated mine design is the result of the review announced by Rio Tinto in July 2019 
when enhanced geotechnical and geological information obtained from drilling and mapping at depth suggested 
there may be "some stability risks" associated with the original mine design. Rio Tinto's ownership share is 33.5% 
of Hugo Dummett North and 29.5% of Hugo Dummett North Extension - both at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia. The 
probable ore reserves for Hugo Dummett North have been revised down to 400 million tonnes from 447 million at

Plastic and fibre product supplier Essentra said its second-quarter performance saw a "profound impact" from the 
Covid-19 pandemic, but the hit was in line with internal expectations. Group like-for-like revenue declined 17% in 
April, but this improved as the quarter progressed. In May it was down 10%, whilst in June it is expected to only 
record a 1% drop. Essentra therefore expects that like-for-like second quarter performance will be down 10%, whilst 
its interim like-for-like revenue is guided to fall 9%. Looking ahead, Essentra anticipates some continued disruption 
to its trading in the coming months but believes that it is still too early to outline the full impact on full year financial 
performance.

Rank Group said will begin the reopening of its Mecca bingo clubs from Saturday. Initially it will be opening 35 
venues in England, with further 30 venues are expected to open in a phased approach throughout July and August 
including, when permitted, its venues in Scotland and Wales. The remaining 12 venues will remain closed until 
October whilst Rank Group assesses their ongoing viability. "Some restructuring of the cost base and format of 
these venues is likely to be necessary to allow them to reopen, including renegotiation of rents," the company said. 
Underlying operating profit for the year ended 30 June is expected to be at the lower end of its previously provided 
guidance range of GBP48 million to GBP58 million, Rank Group said. The company said this is due to the venues 
reopening costs being expensed. Monthly net cash outflow has also been in line with previous guidance, Rank 
Group added, with cash and available facilities at July 1 of about GBP140 million. With the reopening of Mecca, the 
company expects its monthly cash outflow will reduce from about GBP10 million per month to GBP7 million per 
month and to be cashflow positive upon the reopening of Grosvenor.

Online trading platform CMC Markets said its "entire business has continued to perform very well" in its first quarter. 
Client trading activity remains around double that of the same period the year before, CMC added, with client 
income retention "materially" higher than the 82% reported in the first half of the previous financial year. 
Stockbroking net trading revenue also continues to benefit from the market conditions, the company added. As a 
result, net operating income for the first quarter of financial 2021 is in excess of that reported for the first half of 
financial 2020 of GBP102.3 million. "The board is confident that, even in the event that more normalised client 
trading activity returns, with the strong underlying performance of the business, 2021 net operating income will 
exceed the upper end of current market consensus," CMC added.

SoftBank and an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund are in talks to back a UK government-led bid for collapsed 
satellite firm OneWeb, Sky News reported. Sky News said Japanese tech investor SoftBank and Mubadala, an 
investment arm of the Gulf state, have been holding talks with government officials about contributing hundreds of 
millions of pounds to a newly comprised shareholders group. The UK-led bidding team consists currently only of the 
government and existing OneWeb shareholder Bharti Enterprises, Sky News said, according to a person "close to 
the situation". Rival bidders for OneWeb are thought to include Telesat, a Canadian company. London-
headquartered OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in March in the US, where most of its operations are located, after 
failing to secure new funding. It has 74 satellites and already counted Softbank as an investor.

competitiveness. In order to be able to meet increasing demand for German Mercedes-Benz factories in the future, 
Farasis is building a plant for battery cells in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, creating up to 2,000 new jobs. Daimler Greater 
China is investing a "multi-million euro amount" as part of Farasis's IPO, a stake which is conditional upon 
regulatory approvals. The stake will allow Daimler the option to nominate a representative to the board.

trading, while 16 out of 18 leisure parks were open. Accor-managed hotels remain closed, but will go through a 
phased reopening over the next three months. Looking ahead, LandSec said it intends to reinstate dividend 
payments following the announcement of its interim results on November 10. As at June 30 the group's adjusted 
net debt was GBP3.92 billion compared to GBP3.93 billion at the end of March.

Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia is expected to see a 21 to 29 month delay for first production, which will 
increase the development capital needed for the project by between USD1.3 billion to USD1.8 billion from the 
original USD5.3 billion. The updated mine design is the result of the review announced by Rio Tinto in July 2019 
when enhanced geotechnical and geological information obtained from drilling and mapping at depth suggested 
there may be "some stability risks" associated with the original mine design. Rio Tinto's ownership share is 33.5% 
of Hugo Dummett North and 29.5% of Hugo Dummett North Extension - both at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia. The 
probable ore reserves for Hugo Dummett North have been revised down to 400 million tonnes from 447 million at

Ryanair Holdings said its Irish pilots have accepted a four-year agreement including a 20% pay cut restored over 
four years, while its UK and Ireland cabin crew have accepted a 10% cut. The agreement also includes "productivity 
improvements on rosters" as well as "flexible working patterns and annual leave" with the aim of minimising job 
losses for Irish pilots. Budget airline Ryanair, which has its headquarters in Swords near Dublin said the deal gives 
the company "a framework to flex its operation" while the Covid-19 pandemic remains ongoing as well as offering "a 
pathway to recovery" once normality returns. BALPA and Ryanair UK agreed a similar deal earlier in the week that 
also included a 20% pay cut and improvements to productivity. Alongside this, Ryanair also signed agreements with 
the Forsa union concerning Irish based cabin crew and the UNITE union for its UK cabin crew including pay 
reductions of up to 10%. These cuts are also to be fully restored over four years with the agreement also including 
productivity improvements.

Online trading platform CMC Markets said its "entire business has continued to perform very well" in its first quarter. 
Client trading activity remains around double that of the same period the year before, CMC added, with client 
income retention "materially" higher than the 82% reported in the first half of the previous financial year. 
Stockbroking net trading revenue also continues to benefit from the market conditions, the company added. As a 
result, net operating income for the first quarter of financial 2021 is in excess of that reported for the first half of 
financial 2020 of GBP102.3 million. "The board is confident that, even in the event that more normalised client 
trading activity returns, with the strong underlying performance of the business, 2021 net operating income will 
exceed the upper end of current market consensus," CMC added.

SoftBank and an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund are in talks to back a UK government-led bid for collapsed 
satellite firm OneWeb, Sky News reported. Sky News said Japanese tech investor SoftBank and Mubadala, an 
investment arm of the Gulf state, have been holding talks with government officials about contributing hundreds of 
millions of pounds to a newly comprised shareholders group. The UK-led bidding team consists currently only of the 
government and existing OneWeb shareholder Bharti Enterprises, Sky News said, according to a person "close to 
the situation". Rival bidders for OneWeb are thought to include Telesat, a Canadian company. London-
headquartered OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in March in the US, where most of its operations are located, after 
failing to secure new funding. It has 74 satellites and already counted Softbank as an investor.

Stock trading was lacklustre on Friday with markets in the US closed. Momentum in Asia overnight failed to flow

improvement in service sector activity across Europe and Asia.
Financial markets in the US are shut Friday for the Independence Day holiday.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK's private sector saw a sharp improvement in business conditions in June, according to the results of a 
survey by IHS Markit released on Friday, though activity continued to contract. The composite purchasing 
managers' index - which is a weighted average of the UK manufacturing output index and the UK services business 
activity index - improved to 47.7 in June from 30.0 in May. The index hit a record-low of 12.9 in April. June's reading 
is the highest in four months but still remains below the no-change mark of 50. The flash figure for June was 47.6. 
Manufacturing production - 50.7 in June - once again fared better than service sector output - 47.1 - IHS Markit 
said, with the latter hit by a sustained drag from business closures across vast swathes of the consumer services 
and leisure activity. "June data continued to signal a turnaround in business conditions across the UK service 
sector," IHS Markit said.
----------
The eurozone's private sector saw a sharp improvement in conditions in June, according to IHS Markit, though 
activity continued to contract. The composite output index for June surged to 48.5 points from May's 31.9, hitting its 
best level in four months and exceeding the flash reading of 47.5 by a full point. However, with the reading 
remaining below the no-change mark of 50, the latest data indicate business conditions in the eurozone remain 
tough. France was the top performing country in terms of composite purchasing managers' index while Ireland was 
the worst. All those covered, though, recorded four-month highs in June.
----------
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is ruling out any concessions in the "difficult" negotiation over the EU's post-
coronavirus recovery fund. In a Friday interview with Sette, a weekly linked to Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Rutte 
said talks "will be difficult, but a compromise is possible." Yet, when the interviewer told him the Netherlands had to 
be prepared to make concessions, he replied: "That is your interpretation. And that's fine. But it is not our position." 
"Our position is that aid must come in the form of loans and not grants," Rutte said, also stressing that countries 
receiving aid must in return improve their "competitiveness and resilience." "Italy and Spain must answer the 
question: 'what can we do to be able to tackle on our own the next crisis?'" the Dutch premier said. The European 
Commission has made a proposal for a EUR750 billion recovery fund, including EUR500 billion in grants and 
EUR250 billion in loans.
----------
The US posted a record 53,000 new coronavirus cases as the deadly pandemic accelerated across the Americas, 
but its slowdown in Europe led Britain to announce Friday the first exemptions to its quarantine rules. With Europe 
looking to turn the page on the biggest public health crisis in modern history, travellers arriving into Britain from 
Germany, France, Spain and Italy will no longer be required to self-isolate starting July 10. The US soared past 
50,000 new infections Thursday for the second time in two days, casting a grim pall over its upcoming 
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Economic Pace Picks Up, Still In Contraction
Independence Day celebrations. Now the epicentre of the pandemic, the US has recorded nearly 129,000 deaths 
out of more than 2.7 million cases. It's expected to record its three millionth infection next week. Florida, which now 
has more than 169,000 cases, is a key focus of public health experts who worry about a surge in southern and 
western US states. In Texas, where more than 2,500 people have died, Governor Greg Abbott ordered people in 
counties with 20 or more cases to wear masks and banned gatherings of more than 10.
----------
China's services sector grew at its quickest pace in over a decade as Covid-19 lockdown measures continued to 
ease, IHS Markit said. Caixin's seasonally adjusted headline business activity index came in at 58.4 in June, not 
only comfortably above the 50.0 no-change mark but also surging from 55.0 in May. IHS Markit noted it was the 
fastest rate of expansion since April 2010, with new order jumping at the fastest pace since August 2010. The 
composite PMI - compiled using the services and also manufacturing data from earlier in the week - rose to 55.7 in 
June from 54.5 in May, the fastest rate of growth since November 2010.
----------
Japan's services sector reached a four-month high in June but numbers on Friday showed it remained in decline. 
The Jibun Bank services purchasing managers' index jumped to 45.0 in June from 26.5 in May, helped by the state 
of emergency due to Covid-19 being lifted. It was still below the 50.0 marker which separates growth from decline 
and IHS Markit noted that "conditions remained fragile amid low customer numbers and operating rates" amid 
Covid-19.

(Alliance News) - A legal challenge by airlines against the government's 14-day quarantine rule for passengers 
arriving in the UK has reached the High Court.
British Airways, easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC announced the legal action in June, saying the policy is 
"flawed" and will have a "devastating impact on British tourism and the wider economy".
BA is part of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.
The airlines are seeking a judicial review of the rules and are bringing the case against Health Secretary Matt 
Hancock.
The claim will be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice over two days, starting on Friday and continuing on Monday.
Announcing the legal challenge last month, the three airlines said they want the government to readopt its previous 
quarantine policy introduced on March 10, where quarantine is limited to passengers from "high-risk" countries.
They said in a joint statement released at that time: "This would be the most practical and effective solution, and 
enables civil servants to focus on other, more significant issues arising from the pandemic while bringing the UK in 
line with much of Europe which is opening its borders mid-June."
The airlines claim the guidelines are more stringent than those applied to people confirmed to have Covid-19 and 
say there was no consultation and no scientific evidence provided for "such a severe policy".
The government is opposing the legal challenge, which will be heard by two senior judges.
Most international arrivals into the UK – including returning Britons – have been required to enter a 14-day 
quarantine since June 8.
Legal Challenge By Airlines Over Quarantine Rule Reaches UK High Court
All passengers – bar a handful of exemptions – have to fill out an online locator form giving their contact and travel 
details, as well as the address of where they will isolate.
People who fail to comply can be fined GBP1,000 in England and police are allowed to use "reasonable force" to 
make sure they follow the rules.
Border Force officers are carrying out checks on arrivals and can refuse entry to a non-resident foreign national 
who refuses to comply with the regulations.
Failure to complete the locator form is punishable by a GBP100 fixed penalty notice.
The UK government is expected to announce on Friday a list of countries which will have "air bridges" with the UK, 
and therefore be exempt from the restrictions.
The hearing is due to start at 1030 BST.

(Alliance News) - Rival budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC both saw a dramatic drop 
in passenger numbers in June as a result of air travel restrictions imposed by governments across Europe to 
contain the spread of Covid-19.
Ryanair's traffic in June dropped by 97% to 400,000 passengers versus the 14.2 million passengers it carried a 
year earlier.
The airline's subsidiary Lauda flew no passengers in June compared to 600,000 the year before. In early June, 
Ryanair announced Lauda's fleet was grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic, but will gradually start flying 
again on July 1. Ryanair had planned to shutter the loss-making arm but employees agreed to a last-minute wage 
deal.
Ryanair said it operated just 2,800 scheduled flights in June versus its budgeted schedule of 79,600. The airline 
noted 95% of its flights arrived on-time.
On a rolling annual basis to June, the airline said it carried 107.2 million passengers, down 27% from 144.3 million 
a year prior.
Central and eastern European-focused Wizz Air separately reported an 86% fall in June passenger numbers to 
502,253 from 3.6 million in June 2019.
Capacity plummeted 76% year-on-year to 961,797 seats from 3.8 million, while the airline's load factor fell 43 basis 
points to 52.2% from 95.0%.
Available seat kilometres in June fell 75% to 1.52 billion, as revenue passenger kilometres plunged 86% to 802.1 
million.

On a rolling basis to June, passengers were down 16% to 30.4 million, while capacity fell 15% to 33.0 million. Load

More positively, Wizz Air opened 3 new bases in the month - in Bacau, Romania; Dortmund, Germany; and St 
Petersburg, Russia - and has launched 64 new routes.
Shares in Ryanair were 2.6% higher in London on Thursday morning at EUR10.87 each. Wizz Air was trading 1.3%

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Associated British Foods reported a double-digit revenue fall for the past nine months and said it expects profit at 
low-cost fashion retailer Primark to be a third of what was achieved a year ago. However, nearly all Primark stores 
have now reopened and early sales have been strong. AB Foods group revenue for the 40 weeks to June 20 was 
down 13% on a year ago at constant currency, with sales down 39% in the third quarter alone. Among divisions in 
the third quarter, grocery was the stand-out performer, with revenue up 9%, while retail sales at Primark slumped a 
sharp 75%. Primark stores were closed for most of the third quarter, with revenue recorded in the period relating to 
two short periods of trading before stores closed in mid-March and after they started to reopen at the end of the 
quarter. AB Foods said Primark stores have reopened more quickly than expected, particularly in Ireland, since its 
June 1 trading update. A total of 367 stores now have reopened, with the remain 8 expected to follow in the near 
future, it said. Trading in the reopened stores so far has been "reassuring and encouraging".

minute wage deal. Ryanair said it operated just 2,800 scheduled flights in June versus its budgeted schedule of 
79,600. Ryanair's figures did, though, mark an improvement on May. The Irish budget airline reported a 99.5% dive 
in May traffic to just 70,000 passengers. Meanwhientral and eastern European-focused Wizz Air reported an 86% 
fall in June passenger numbers to 502,253 from 3.6 million in June 2019.

DS Smith reported a rise annual profit - with box volumes ahead of internal targets - but has opted against a 
shareholder payout. For the 12 months to April 30, the London-headquartered packaging firm's pretax profit 
improved 5.1% to GBP368 million from GBP350 million. Revenue, however, slipped 2.1% to GBP6.04 billion from 
GBP6.17 billion. Profit grew despite a drop in revenue, DS Smith said, as it recorded GBP237 million in profit from 
discontinued operations, compared to GBP12 million the year before. "We have made good strategic and financial 
progress in the year, with the disposal of our Plastics division reinforcing our focus on sustainable fibre-based 
packaging and our strong commercial focus driving record margin," Chief Executive Miles Roberts said. DS Smith 
said its performance in the first 10 months of its financial year was "robust", but then took a "relatively limited" 
GBP15 million hit from the pandemic in the final two months. The FTSE 100-listed packaging firm has already 
declared it would not issue an interim dividend, but has now also decided against a final dividend too - as its short 
term outlook "remains too uncertain".

MARKETS
----------
Some encouraging vaccine news from Pfizer and BioNTech helped to boost stocks in Europe on Thursday, with 
Wall Street also on course for a higher start. The Dow Jones is called up 0.9%, the S&P 500 up 0.6% and the 
Nasdaq up 0.5%. Among the risers in the FTSE 100 was Associated British foods, while DS Smith tugged at the 
other end of the index. The dollar was lower ahead of key US jobs data due at 1330 BST, with consensus pencilling 
in an increase of 3.0 million jobs in June, according to FXStreet.

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: AB Foods's Primark Reopening Trade "Encouraging"
The global coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, the World Health Organization warned Wednesday, as the worst-
hit US closed bars and beaches ahead of the Independence Day holiday. Infections hit their highest level worldwide 
in the past week, WHO data showed, with chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying new cases had topped 
"160,000 on every single day." The grim milestone came as the EU left Russia, Brazil and the US off its final list of 
nations safe enough to allow residents to enter its borders. With new Covid-19 cases in the US surging to more 
than 40,000 daily, several US states imposed 14-day quarantines on out-of-state travellers in the buildup to 
Saturday's July 4 festivities. California suspended indoor dining at restaurants in Los Angeles and several counties 
while New York scrapped plans to allow restaurants to seat customers inside from next week. The rollbacks came 
as the EU reopened its borders to visitors from 15 countries.
----------
US President Donald Trump says he supports injecting a fresh round of stimulus into the economy, as the recovery 
from the coronavirus recession tries to get underway. Trump told the Fox Business Network he wants to ensure 
stimulus benefits encourage people to get back to work, arguing the last round of expanded unemployment 
payments incentivized employees to stay home. "It's got to be done properly," Trump said in an interview broadcast 
Wednesday. "We're working on that and I'm sure it will come together." Trump said he would be meeting Senate 
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to discuss details of a new stimulus plan. It may include more direct cash 
payments. Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a USD3 trillion fresh stimulus bill that Republicans 
rejected out of hand, saying it was too expensive and contained progressive agenda items unrelated to the 
coronavirus pandemic. Trump claimed his plan would get more money to consumers than the Democrats' proposal.
----------
The eurozone unemployment rate edged upwards in May as Covid-19 lockdowns continued to take a toll, data from 
Eurostat showed, though not as sharp as consensus expected. The eurozone seasonally adjusted unemployment 
rate was 7.4% in May, up from 7.3% in April, but still beat market consensus, which according to FXStreet had 
anticipated an increase to 7.7%. Compared with April, the number of those out of work increased by 253,000. 
Separately, Eurostat reported a drop in industrial producer prices for May. Annually, prices slumped by 5.0%, a 
sharper decline than April's 4.5% fall, which was attributed to energy, where prices fell by 17%, and a 2.9% 
decrease in prices for intermediate goods.
----------
Germany's parliament is expected to put to bed Thursday fears that the country's powerful central bank could be 
barred from participating in a crucial eurozone-wide bond-buying scheme. In a stunning decision in May, Germany's 
Federal Constitutional Court threatened to block the Bundesbank, the central bank, from taking part in the stimulus 
plan unless the European Central Bank could show within three months that its government debt purchases are not 
"disproportionate". While the court made clear its ruling did not affect ECB programmes to shore up the economy 
during the coronavirus pandemic, it raised uncertainty over an important stimulus tool as Europe faces the worst 
economic storm since World War II. Based on an early June decision by the ECB governing council and documents 
forwarded to Berlin, the Bundestag is expected Thursday to say it is satisfied the bank did not overstep its mark.
----------
China said it reserves "the right to take corresponding measures" if the UK pushes forward with its plan to give 
three million Hong Kong residents the right to settle in the country. Boris Johnson accused Beijing of a "clear and 
serious breach" of its treaty with Britain by imposing a much-criticised national security law on the territory. The 
prime minister said he would introduce a route for people with British National Overseas status to apply for visas to 
live and work in the UK and apply for citizenship. In response, the Chinese Embassy in the UK said such a move 
would be in breach of "international law and basic norms governing international relations". A statement said: "We 
firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are set to open higher on Thursday, lifted by encouraging vaccine testing 
data from Pfizer and BioNTech, with markets looking ahead to the monthly US jobs report later in the day.
In early UK company news, Associated British Foods guided to a sharp slump in Primark profit for its current 
financial year. DS Smith said it saw a GBP15 million hit from Covid-19 in its recently-ended year. Ryanair's June 
traffic, while down sharply on a year ago, saw a slight improvement on May.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 44.04 points higher at 6,202.00 on Thursday. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 11.78 points, or 0.2%, at 6,157.96 on Wednesday.
"Equity markets turned in a solid performance overnight, driven by a surprising rebound in US ADP employment 
data, and positive Covid-19 vaccine trials from Pfizer," said Jeffery Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at 
Oanda.
BioNTech of Germany and US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer reported positive preliminary results on Wednesday from 
a joint project to develop a coronavirus vaccine.
Known as BNT162b1, it produces antibody responses at or above the levels seen in any convalescent serum – 
blood from people who have recovered – at relatively low doses, according to BioNTech Chief Executive Officer 
Ugur Sahin. The preliminary data come from a so-called phase 1/2 trial that aimed to show the vaccine is not toxic 
and triggers an immune system response to prepare the body to fight off the virus. 
Of 45 people aged 18 to 55 who took part in the trial, most received two doses, 21 days apart, of the vaccine or a 
placebo.
A relatively high number of participants developed a fever after the second dose, according to a study uploaded on 
the pre-publication website medrxiv.org. But this is not unexpected and is not considered a stumbling block.

Oanda's Halley said: "With markets vaccinating themselves over US Covid-19 worries and geopolitical concerns, 
they are back in peak-virus, buy everything mode. That will continue into Europe with only a severe downward 
surprise in the US data dump this evening likely to upset the narrative."
In Asia on Thursday, the Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo closed up 0.1%. The Shanghai Composite is up 1.9%. The 
Hang Seng index is up 1.9% as Hong Kong reopened after a local holiday on Wednesday.  
In the US on Wednesday, Wall Street ended mostly higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending down 
0.3%, but the S&P 500 up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.0%.
In early UK company news, Associated British Foods said it expects profit at low-cost fashion retailer Primark to be 
a third of what was achieved a year ago. 
AB Foods group revenue for the 40 weeks to June 20 was down 13% on a year ago at constant currency, with 
sales down 39% in the third quarter alone.  Among divisions in the third quarter, grocery was the stand-out 
performer, with revenue up 9%, while retail sales at Primark slumped a sharp 75%. 
Primark stores were closed for most of the third quarter, with revenue recorded in the period relating to two short 
periods of trading before stores closed in mid-March and after they reopened at the end of the quarter.
The net cash outflow for Primark in the 12 week period to May 23 - when trading was non-existent or minimal - was 
around GBP800 million. This comprised payments to suppliers and operating expenses. 
Looking ahead, AB Foods said: "For the full year we continue to expect strong progress in the aggregate adjusted 
operating profit of our Sugar, Grocery, Agriculture and Ingredients businesses. This will be mainly driven by a 
material increase in profit at AB Sugar and another year of good margin and profit growth in Grocery."
Nearly all Primark stores are now trading again, the company said, and absent a significant number of further store 
closures, adjusted operating profit for Primark, excluding exceptional charges, will be in the range of GBP300 
million to GBP350 million for the full year, compared to GBP913 million reported for the last financial year.
Packaging firm DS Smith said it saw a limited impact from Covid-19 in its recently ended financial year, with the firm 
confident in its prospects.
Revenue for the year to April 30 was down 2% to GBP6.04 million but pretax profit rose 5% to GBP368 million. 
Box volumes in the first five months of the second half grew as anticipated, "significantly" ahead of the first half of 
the year and ahead of the market. The company said its performance over the first 10 months of the year was 
"robust" with a limited impact - of around GBP15 million - in the final two months from Covid-19. 
"New ways of working have been implemented to reflect the latest guidance on safe operations and changes in 
demand, which has obviously led to some additional costs. We also saw a reduction in our overall box volumes 
during April and May due to weakness in the industrial customer categories when the crisis was at its peak. We 
estimate the direct impact to operating profit in 2019-20 to be in the region of GBP15 million. In the new financial 
year, the recent spike in [old corrugated cases] is expected to have the largest ongoing impact," said DS Smith.
Infrastructure constrains have driven elevated OCC prices, the firm explained, but this impact is expected to be 
limited to the first half. 
"In the medium-term, the growth drivers of e-commerce and sustainability are as strong as ever. The Covid-19 
crisis is also expected to accelerate a number of the structural drivers for corrugated packaging, and our scale and 
innovation-led customer offering positions us well and gives us confidence for the future," said DS Smith.
Pub chain Mitchells & Butlers swung to an interim loss as trading was dealt a blow in the first half from Covid-19 
lockdowns.

Total revenue in the 28 weeks to April 11 fell to GBP1.04 billion from GBP1.19 billion and the firm swing to a pretax 
loss of GBP121 million from a GBP75 million profit.
Trading in the first half included nearly four weeks of enforced closure due to Covid-19, the firm highlighted, with 
like-for-like sales growth of 0.9% before closure remaining "consistently ahead of the market". 
"The business was performing very well before the enforced closure in response to Covid-19, building on the 
strengths of our estate of mainly freehold properties, our diversified and well-loved brands and our team's industry 
leading operational skills. These assets, coupled with our early experience of re-opening in Germany, give us a 
clear plan for re-opening," said Chief Executive Phil Urban.
Ryanair said June traffic was down 97% year-on-year to 400,000 passengers from 14.2 million a year ago. The low-
cost airline operated just over 2,800 scheduled flights in June out of its budget of 79,600.
Austrian subsidiary Lauda flew no passengers at all in June. 
Ryanair's figures do, though, mark an improvement on May. The Irish budget airline reported a 99.5% dive in May 
traffic to just 70,000 passengers.
Peer Wizz Air on Thursday had reported a 86% decrease in passengers in June, carrying 502,253 versus the year-
ago figure of 3.6 million. Load factor slumped to 52.2% from 95.0%.
The economic events calendar on Thursday has eurozone unemployment and producer prices at 1000 BST. In the 
afternoon, there is the US jobs report for June at 1330 BST - brought forward from the usual release day of Friday 
due to this week's Independence Day holiday.
Consensus is for 3.0 million jobs to have been added in June, up from 2.5 million in May, according to FXStreet. 
The unemployment rate is expected to edge down to 12.3% from 13.3%.
The dollar was slightly lower ahead of the jobs print. 
Sterling was quoted at USD1.2496 early Thursday, up from USD1.2459 at the London equities close on 
Wednesday. The euro traded at USD1.1268 early Thursday, firm on USD1.1260 late Wednesday. 
Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY107.48 versus JPY107.52.
The US notched more than 52,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours Wednesday, a tally by Johns Hopkins 
University showed, a new one-day record as infections surge around the country.
The Baltimore-based university's tracker showed 52,898 more cases as of 2030 EDT, bringing the total number of 
cases since the pandemic reached the US to 2.68 million. The university also recorded a further 706 fatalities, 
bringing the total death toll to 128,028. 
New daily case numbers have hovered around 40,000 in recent days, with Johns Hopkins recording 42,528 new 
infections one day earlier. Hospitalizations are also increasing in several cities, including Houston, Texas and 
Phoenix, Arizona.
On Wednesday Texas broke its daily record and reported 8,076 new cases of Covid-19, nearly 1,000 more than the 
day before. 
The surge in cases has seen several states pause their re-openings. California on Wednesday banned indoor 
dining in Los Angeles as well as service in bars, cinemas and museums for at least three weeks.
Gold was quoted at USD1,766.82 an ounce early Thursday, up from USD1,764.23 on Wednesday. Brent oil was 
trading at USD42.24 a barrel early Thursday, higher than USD41.80 late Wednesday.

(Alliance News) - Airlines have ramped up their flight schedules from the UK in a bid to recover from the 
coronavirus pandemic.
More than 1,000 flights per day are being operated by Ryanair Holdings PLC, which has run a skeleton schedule 
since mid-March.
It is restoring almost 90% of its route network but frequencies are lower than normal, with just 40% of its normal 
July capacity.
A Ryanair flight to Malaga, Spain, on Wednesday afternoon will be the first departure from Southend Airport in three 
months.
easyJet PLC is running around 500 flights each day across Europe, including more than 900 a week to and from 
the UK.
It restarted a small number of flights on June 15 after all its aircraft were grounded in March.
Both airlines require passengers to wear face masks or coverings as part of enhanced safety and hygiene 
measures.
British Airways, part of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, has said it will make a "meaningful return" to 
service this month.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "We expect in July to carry more than 4.5 million customers, many of 
them families taking well-earned Mediterranean holidays after the severe challenges of the Covid-19 lockdown, 
home schooling, etc.
"These 1,000 daily flights mark an important turning point for Ryanair and for the tourism industry of Europe, which 
supports so many jobs and small businesses."

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed on Tuesday that air bridges will soon be created to allow people 
arriving in the UK from certain countries to avoid the 14-day quarantine policy.
A list of exempt destinations will be published later this week.
Shapps also revealed that the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is reviewing its position of advising against all non-
essential overseas travel.
National Express coaches are back on the road for the first time since April 5.
All passengers are having their temperature checked and anyone with a reading over 38C is being denied boarding 
and given a full refund.
Managing director Chris Hardy said: "It's great to have around 500 drivers back behind the wheel.
"All of our teams have been working hard to get us ready to safely welcome customers back onboard, implementing 
significant changes to protect everyone's health and well being.
"We're happy to be back on the road and playing our part in getting the country safely moving again by providing a 
safe option for those who have no alternative to public transport."

(Alliance News) - The Irish government has warned against non-essential foreign travel and said it risks undoing the 
progress the country has made in combating the virus.
There is uncertainty around whether people should travel overseas after Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan 
advised Irish residents to cancel foreign holidays to prevent a potential second surge.
Ryanair Holdings PLC is operating 40% of its schedule across Europe from Wednesday and the government is due 
to release a "green list" of countries deemed safe to travel to.
Senior civil servant Liz Canavan of the Department of the Taoiseach said on Wednesday that additional movement 
due to the lifting of restrictions means the risk of virus spreading becomes greater if people do not act responsibly.
She said: "Covid-19 has not changed, it's the same infectious disease it was at the beginning of all of this…It is still 
the disease that is most dangerous for older people.
"During this phase, the government advice is still to avoid non-essential travel. As I said already, we have largely 
suppressed the spread of the virus in the community in Ireland and this is a major achievement.
"It is important to remember the early days of this pandemic and that early cases were associated with international 
travel.
"We realise how infectious Covid-19 is and the very real possibility that a person may not show any symptoms. The 
risk now is that imported cases will spread infection before we can identify the chain of transmission."
Canavan said the situation regarding imported cases is "volatile" but the government plans on giving an update 
about travel in the coming weeks.
"We understand that the issue of foreign travel is causing great uncertainty and worry. Some people have holidays 
booked and don't know what to do – we are acutely aware of this and ask you to bear with us."
Irish Government Warns Against Non-Essential Travel As Airlines Resume
Earlier, an infectious disease specialist said it is safe to travel abroad as long as coronavirus protocols are adhered 
to.
Jack Lambert, of the Mater and Rotunda hospitals, told RTE radio: "If we do the hand-washing, social distancing 
and wear a face mask then yes, it is safe to travel.
"When I was working in hospital I took care of 700 people who had Covid. I didn't stand there without a mask – I 
used all of the appropriate precautions and I did not catch Covid-19.
"We have to to come up with practical solutions because there is no end point with Covid, but there is an end point 
with our economy.
"There is an end point with how long people can continue to live in lockdown and have total restrictions on travel for 
business, family and personal reasons.
"I wouldn't recommend going to Florida because Covid is rampant in Florida. Would I go to Greece, Slovenia? 
Absolutely. I probably think it is safer to go there than city centres in Ireland at the present time because Covid is 
still circulating in the community in small numbers.
"I think we have to come up with solutions that are practical and not just come up with broad strokes that nobody 
should travel and everybody should be quarantined.
"We have to have a measured response to this because going forward, this is not a short-term problem – this is a 
long-time pandemic."
One new Covid-19 death and 11 new cases were confirmed in Ireland on Tuesday.
There have been 1,736 Covid-19 related deaths in Ireland and 25,473 confirmed cases.

(Alliance News) - Low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC will challenge the EUR9-billion rescue of Germany's 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG, one of the world's biggest airlines, before an EU court, a top executive said on Thursday.
"We have said to the commission we will appeal all other decisions and all approvals: the same goes for today's 
approval of aid to Lufthansa," Juliusz Gomorek, Ryanair's chief legal officer, told reporters. 
Ryanair has already appealed to the Luxembourg-based General Court against aid granted by France, Denmark 
and Sweden to airlines and cleared by EU competition enforcers.
The fate of Germany's ailing Lufthansa airline will be decided later Thursday at an extraordinary shareholders' 
meeting, in which a EUR9 billion government bailout will be put to a vote.
Lufthansa has spiralled into crisis as a result of the catastrophic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on air travel.
The deal, which Lufthansa has said is necessary in order to save the company from insolvency, would require the 
German government taking a 20% share in the company.
Valued at around EUR300 million, that stake is only a small part of the total package - but it has irked investors, 
who will see their own shares diluted as a result of the state intervention. Meanwhile, the government is set to pay 
EUR2.56 per share, around a quarter of the current stock market price.
The outcome of the online meeting largely comes down to one man, Lufthansa's biggest shareholder, Heinz 
Hermann Thiele.
He had been critical of the deal, but in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Wednesday he said 
he had decided to vote in favour of it.
UPDATE: Ryanair To Challenge Lufthansa Rescue In EU Court
Shareholder presence at the online meeting is expected to represent less than 50% of capital. This means a two-
thirds majority is needed in the vote - which would have been a tall order without Thiele's backing. He holds a 
15.5% stake.
The bailout was negotiated between Lufthansa, the Berlin government and the European Commission.
The commission, which acts as the EU's antitrust watchdog, gave its official approval to the multi-billion-dollar deal 
on Thursday.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday added 64 new routes from Vienna, Austria, and took another 
swipe at "subsidy junkie" Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
From next Wednesday, the budget airline's Vienna base will offer 64 new routes, including summer trips to tourist 
hotspots such as Rome, Faro and Athens. The measures are part of Ryanair's post-Covid Summer 2020 schedule. 
The pandemic battered the airline industry in recent months, emptying skies and forcing some carriers, Ryanair 
included, to pursue redundancies. 
The company added: "As Austrians taxes get wasted on illegal state aid to German owned Austrian Airlines, 
Ryanair will guarantee low fares for Austrian customers/visitors at prices which start from EUR9.99 one way. 
Vienna holidaymakers can now plan an exciting summer getaway with fares starting from just EUR9.99 for travel in 
July & August before some misguided Austrian Minister tries to ban them."
Austrian Airlines is a subsidiary of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, and earlier in June, it struck a EUR600 million rescue 
deal with Austria's government. 
Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary on Thursday labelled Lufthansa a "subsidy junkie". 
The German flag carrier was poised to clear a key shareholder vote on its EUR9 billion state rescue Thursday, 
boosted by the EU's green light and the last-minute backing of a billionaire investor who had the power to veto the 
plan.
The European Commission said it had approved the German government's EUR6 billion cash injection to keep 
Lufthansa afloat as the coronavirus pandemic pummels the airline industry, but imposed strict conditions.

The massive rescue package also includes EUR3 billion in public loan guarantees and would see Berlin taking a 
20% stake in the airline giant.
Ryanair said it will challenge the rescue deal before an EU court. 
"We have said to the commission we will appeal all other decisions and all approvals: the same goes for today's 
approval of aid to Lufthansa," Juliusz Gomorek, Ryanair's chief legal officer, told reporters on Thursday.
Ryanair shares were 1.4% lower at EUR10.58 each in London on Thursday afternoon.

London Stock Exchange Group has poached Anna Manz, the current Johnson Matthey chief financial officer, as its

stepping down November 20 - the day before Johnson Matthey's interim results publication. The search for her 
successor has begun. At stock exchange and clearing operator LSEG, Manz replaces outgoing CFO David Warren 
starting November 21. She will report to LSEG Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer. LSEG said back in

October that Warren would be leaving by the end of 2020. It said at the time that he would stay on through the close 
of the company's proposed acquisition of market data firm Refinitiv.

BAE Systems expects its performance in the second half to be much stronger than in the first half as it returns 
towards "full operational tempo". the FTSE 100-listed firm said it has continued to focus on its near-term priorities, 
including supporting its supply chain in dealing with pandemic-related disruption and ensuring the maintenance of 
appropriate liquidity. In parallel, BAE Systems said it has taken actions to enhance its resilience and position the 
business towards a return to "full operational tempo". The company noted that it is investing in new facilities to meet 
the growth profile in a number of sectors. BAE Systems said its productivity levels in June have improved within its 
defence unit after the pandemic hurt the business in the second quarter.
----------
Auto Trader Group proposed no final dividend for its recent financial year, as it looks to preserve cash amid the 
Covid-19 outbreak, despite reporting a solid annual performance. For the year that ended in March, the 
Manchester-based automotive marketplace reported a pretax profit of GBP251.5 million, up 3.8% from GBP242.2 
million the year before, partly due to a fall in finance costs to GBP7.4 million from GBP10.2 million. This was on 
revenue that grew by 3.9% year-on-year to GBP368.9 million from GBP355.1 million, with average revenue per 
retailer increasing by 5.7% to GBP1,949 from GBP1,844, as growth from products and pricing more than offset the 
reduction in stock. As a result of declaring no final dividend, Auto Trader's total annual dividend stays at 2.4 pence 
per share, down 64% from 6.7p the year before.
----------
Royal Mail reported a slump in full-year profit, announced plans to cut 2,000 management jobs and said it is 
targeting the restart of dividends in the 2022 financial year. Revenue for the financial year that ended in March was 
GBP10.84 billion, up 2.5% from GBP10.58 billion the year before, which comprised 53 weeks. Pretax profit dropped 
to GBP180 million from GBP241 million as operating costs rose 3.7% to GBP10.62 billion. Profit was hit by a 
GBP51 million regulatory fine and a GBP91 million impairment charge, which was up from GBP68 million the year 
before. To save costs, Royal Mail is to cut around 2,000 UK management roles, which is expected to deliver an 
annual operating profit benefit in the 2022 financial year of GBP330 million. The year's dividend per share of 7.5 
pence reflects the board's decision not to recommend a final dividend, against a total payout of 25p the year before. 
Royal Mail does not expect to pay a dividend in the financial year ahead, but it is targeting the restart of payouts in 
the 2022 financial year.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK government is due to publish the latest data from its coronavirus test and trace service as Prime Minister 
Boris Johnson continues to defend it from criticism. The Department for Health & Social Care is expected to release 
figures for England on Thursday the NHS Test & Trace Service between June 11 and 17, its third week of 
operation. It comes as Johnson insisted the system is a "cluster-busting operation" that would quickly tackle any 
localised Covid-19 outbreaks after he was challenged by Labour leader Keir Starmer over a discrepancy between 
the estimated number of coronavirus cases in the UK and those covered by test and trace. Meanwhile, Health 
Secretary Matt Hancock refused to give a date on when the controversial test and trace app would be made 
available, but said the government is "going to make it work".
----------
The mood among German consumers is brightening further as the country emerges from months of coronavirus 
lockdown, GfK said, but still has ground to make up on the pre-pandemic world. "Rapid reopening of the economy 
and society in Germany is helping consumers get over the corona shock more and more," GfK said, as its monthly 
forward-looking barometer predicted -9.6 points for July, up nine points on this month. The measure had fallen as 
low as -23.1 points, an all-time low, in May. Not only reopening, but "extensive aid from government stimulus 
programmes including reduced VAT" in the second half of the year is helping lift spirits, according to GfK expert 
Rolf Buerkl. In another sign of consumption picking up again, a measure of people's inclination to save fell 
compared with June. But GfK also warned that rising unemployment figures and the deep recession prompting 
fears of layoffs would likely keep the good vibes in check.
----------
More than 78,000 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US and in Brazil alone Wednesday, as the 
International Monetary Fund laid out the unprecedented economic devastation caused by the global pandemic and 
the World Health Organisation warned the number of infections could reach 10 million worldwide within the next 
week. As many countries emerged from lockdown hoping to resurrect their economies, US states were reimposing 
virus restrictions and Brazilian experts were warning the country was sending people "to the slaughterhouse." The 
International Monetary Fund said that this "crisis like no other" would send the global GDP plunging by 4.9% this 
year and wipe out an astonishing USD12 trillion over two years. It said that many countries will face a recession 
more than double that which they suffered during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009.
----------
US President Donald Trump has said he will move some troops from Germany to Poland, as he bashed Berlin for 
failing to meet a NATO defence-spending target and for buying energy from Russia. "They will be paying for the 
sending of additional troops, and we will probably be moving them from Germany to Poland," Trump said during a 
joint press conference with Polish President Andrzej Duda, meaning that Warsaw would cover the cost. He said the 
US would be reducing its presence in Germany "very substantially," while confirming the previous new target level 
of 25,000 troops. Some of the troops would return to the US, while others would be redeployed, including to Poland,

Trump explained. Duda said he had asked Trump not to withdraw troops from Europe altogether as the US military 
presence has guaranteed European security since the end of World War II.

(Alliance News) - Dart Group PLC's Jet2Holidays on Wednesday said it has been forced to make redundancies as 
the Covid-19 outbreak battered the travel sector. 
Jet2 is the latest to wield job cuts, in what is a tough time for airlines globally, after lockdowns and international 
travel restrictions emptied skies. UK pilots' union BALPA said it was told of 102 job cuts at Jet2. 
A spokesperson for Jet2 said: "The implications related to the coronavirus crisis have been complicated, with 
changes on an almost daily basis. Additionally, we are still faced with uncertainty in relation to lockdown and its 
continued challenges.
"As a result, we have had to reassess and reduce our flying programme for the remainder of 2020 and for 2021. 
Sadly, the overall effect of these reductions has been the need to propose a number of colleague redundancies 
across our business. We cannot say how much we regret these proposed redundancies and we will be consulting 
with appropriate representatives of the affected colleagues in order to ensure that all options and issues are fully 
considered."
BALPA said Leeds-based airline Jet2 informed the union of plans to cut 102 pilot jobs.
BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said: "This is yet more evidence, if it were needed, of the freefall in 
aviation, and the knee-jerk way airlines are responding, especially as lockdown is gradually being eased.
"Many of the pilots whose jobs are on the line in Jet2 have just recently moved there after having lost their jobs at 
Thomas Cook – these pilots have been through the mill already. Despite being one of our least union friendly 
airlines, I hope Jet2 negotiates in good faith and works with us on how we can mitigate these proposed losses and 
see Jet2 thrive in the future.
Dart 's Jet2Holidays Plans Job Cuts Due To Covid-19 Pandemic
Strutton again called for the UK government to intervene, urging for a "job cuts moratorium" and a "strategic support 
package". 
Ryanair Holdings PLC in May proposed 336 pilot job cuts, BALPA said at the time, in addition to slashing salaries 
by 20%. Ryanair said it would slash 3,000 jobs in the company in response to destructive effects the Covid-19 
pandemic has had on travel.
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA's British Airways in April warned of 12,000 job losses.
"BALPA does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every 
single one," Strutton said at the time. 
Dart Group shares closed 5.3% lower at 818.50 pence each in London on Wednesday.

(Alliance News) - An airport industry group on Wednesday said more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in Britain due to 
the economic impact the coronavirus pandemic, amid reports that Swissport plans to cut more than 4,000 jobs.
The Airport Operators' Association called for government help after its analysis suggested that 20,000 airport jobs 
are at risk in Britain "as the full effects of the [coronavirus] pandemic on the global airline community begin to be 
felt."
More than 110,000 jobs could be lost if firms providing services to airports or indirectly dependent upon them are 
included, the AOA said.
Trade unions and British media reported on Wednesday that Swissport has told staff that it plans consultations on 
cutting about half of its 9,000 jobs in Britain.
AOA chief executive Karen Dee said Britain's commercial aviation sector had "weathered the worst three months in 
its history."
Dee urged the government to drop its "arbitrary quarantine policy, which has unnecessarily stifled the sector's 
restart and recovery plans."
"These [AOA] jobs figures clearly show that a key component of the UK's infrastructure is on its knees, with no relief 
to the current crisis expected," she added.
The government has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international arrivals in Britain, which airlines warned 
could bring "economic disaster."
It later announced planned exemptions for arrivals from European nations popular with British holidaymakers, 
including Spain and Portugal.
British Airports Say 20,000 Jobs At Risk; Swissport Plans Cuts
Airlines said the government had effectively banned people from travelling to countries with lower coronavirus 
infection rates than Britain.
Broadcaster Sky News quoted a memo to Swissport's 8,500 staff in Britain and Ireland, from Jason Holt, its chief 
executive for Western Europe, as saying the company had to "adapt to this new reality" in which air traffic was not 
forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until as late as 2024.
Holt said Swissport, which provides baggage handling and other services at most British regional airports, planned 
to start consultations on the possible cutting of 4,556 positions.
Trade unions GMB and Unite, which represent many Swissport staff, said the plan to cut jobs was "devastating 
news."
The unions urged the government to provide "a bespoke financial package ... to support the aviation industry and 
save thousands of jobs as the economy continues to reopen."
Major British airlines have also announced possible staff cuts, including 12,000 at British Airways, 4,500 at easyJet 
PLC and 3,000 at Ryanair Holdings PLC. British Airways is a part of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.

(Alliance News) - EasyJet's boss has insisted he would "feel 100% safe" on packed planes as the airline restarts 
operations for the first time in 11 weeks.
Chief Executive Johan Lundgren told the PA news agency that the Luton-based carrier has taken guidance from 
international regulators to develop an enhanced safety and hygiene regime for its resumption of flights on Monday.
Passengers and crew will be required to wear masks, aircraft will be regularly deep-cleaned and disinfection wipes 
and hand sanitiser will be made available.
EasyJet's first UK flight since it grounded its aircraft on March 30 due to the coronavirus pandemic will take off from 
Gatwick at 7am and touch down in Glasgow 90 minutes later.
Lundgren said not operating a single flight in nearly three months has been "devastating", and the airline is "super 
excited" to resume.
He will travel on his first easyJet flight after the restart on Wednesday.
Asked if he would be anxious about his health if the plane is full, he replied: "I would feel 100% safe.
"The recommendations that we've implemented have been defined together with international regulators Easa 
(European Aviation Safety Agency), ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation), the CAA (Civil Aviation 
Authority) and also our own company's medical doctors and expertise."
The Airbus A321neo - easyJet's largest aircraft - can seat 235 passengers.
Despite the 14-day quarantine policy and current travel restrictions imposed in the UK, Lundgren said he believed 
summer holidays will be possible.
EasyJet Boss Says He Would Feel Safe On Full Planes As Flights Restart
He went on: "We would hope and would be really looking forward to restrictions being either lifted, or air bridges put 
in place where it made sense to do so, allowing UK customers as well as people in the rest of Europe to be able to 
go on a holiday."
Air bridges would involve travellers arriving from countries where the risk of being infected by coronavirus is 
deemed to be low to avoid having to self-isolate for 14 days.
EasyJet's initial schedule will involve mainly domestic flying in the UK and France.
The airline will ramp up its operations in the coming weeks.
It plans to reopen half of its 1,022 routes by the end of next month, increasing to 75% during August.
But flights will be at a lower frequency than normal, meaning the airline will operate at around 30% of its normal 
capacity between July and September.
EasyJet announced plans to cut up to 4,500 jobs as it does not expect demand to return to 2019 levels until 2023.
Ryanair PLC intends to restore 40% of its flights from July 1, while International Consolidated Airlines Group SA's 
British Airways is due to make a "meaningful return" to service next month.

British Airways ' Treatment Of Staff Is National Disgrace, Say UK MPs
British Airways' Treatment Of Staff Is National Disgrace, Say UK MPs

(Alliance News) - British Airways' treatment of its workforce during the coronavirus pandemic "is a national 
disgrace", UK members of Parliament claimed Friday.
A report by the Commons Transport Select Committee accused the airline of a "calculated attempt to take 
advantage" of the crisis by cutting up to 12,000 jobs and downgrading the terms and conditions of the bulk of its 
remaining employees.
The carrier, part of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, insisted no decisions have been made and it is 
doing everything it can to "sustain the maximum number of jobs".
Other aviation companies have also announced thousands of redundancies, including easyJet PLC, Ryanair 
Holdings PLC, Virgin Atlantic, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC and Airbus SE.
The cross-party committee of MPs acknowledged that job losses in the sector "may sadly be inevitable" due to the 
huge reduction in air travel as a result of Covid-19.
But it urged UK-based employers not to "proceed hastily" by making large numbers of people redundant while the 
government's furlough scheme is in place.
Unions told the committee they are opposed to what they described as a "fire and rehire" approach being 
considered by British Airways.
They stated the airline is proposing to give redundancy notices to most of its 42,000 workers and offer jobs with 
new terms and conditions to a proportion of them, if it cannot reach an agreement on job cuts and other changes.
The minimum 45-day consultation period for some workers ends on Monday.
BA has had discussions with pilots' union Balpa, including over the possibility of voluntary redundancies.
British Airways ' Treatment Of Staff Is National Disgrace, Say UK MPs
But the other two main unions representing its workers – Unite and GMB – are not engaging in talks.
The committee found that British Airways had received nearly GBP35 million from the government as of May 14 by 
furloughing 22,000 staff.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways' parent company IAG, told the MPs that the amount of money the 
airline received from the scheme in April was equivalent to less than two days of staff wages.
Unions have argued that the airline could survive even if all its planes were grounded for 12 months.
The committee's report stated: "The behaviour of British Airways and its parent company towards its employees is a 
national disgrace.
"It falls well below the standards we would expect from any employer, especially in light of the scale of taxpayer 
subsidy, at this time of national crisis."
There have been calls from some MPs for British Airways to be stripped of some of its lucrative take-off and landing 
slots at Heathrow as punishment for the treatment of its workforce.
Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said: "We will continue to bring pressure where we can, 
including the airport slot allocation process.
"This wanton destruction of a loyal workforce cannot appear to go without sanction by Government, 
parliamentarians or paying passengers who may choose differently in future. We view it as a national disgrace."
British Airways said in a statement: "Merriman made clear several weeks ago that the Transport Select Committee's 
report would be 'fuelled by the kind and impassioned messages' he received, rather than the facts.
"The facts are clear. The government has no plans to help the sector restart and recover as evidenced by the 
introduction of the 14-day quarantine regulation.
"We find ourselves in the deepest crisis ever faced by the airline industry. A crisis not of our making but one which 
we must address.
"We will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of 
jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy."
Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: "The case the company makes for sacking 12,000 and trashing the 
wages of those who stay on the workforce is full of holes because it is a transparent effort to generate profits out of 
a crisis.
"BA is fooling nobody. Never before has the country witnessed such wholesale mistreatment of a UK workforce and 
such brutal industrial thuggery."
The committee's report into the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector also urged the government to 
abandon its 14-day quarantine rule at the end of June.
It called for a "more targeted and nuanced border control policy", allowing people travelling from countries where 
the infection rate of Covid-19 is relatively low to enter the UK on a less restrictive basis.
A government spokesman said: "We continue to work at speed to help protect the long-term future of the sector, 
however we will always put public health first, and we must not risk an extremely damaging second wave of the 
virus."

(Alliance News) - easyJet PLC, Ryanair PLC and International Consolidated Airlines Group SA's British Airways 
have launched legal action against the UK government's "flawed" 14-day quarantine policy.
The airlines announced they have asked for a judicial review to be heard "as soon as possible", claiming the 
measures introduced this week will have a "devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy".
They said they have seen no evidence of when proposed air bridges between the UK and other countries will be 
implemented.
Instead, they want the government to re-adopt the policy it introduced on March 10, which saw passengers from 
countries deemed at high risk of coronavirus infection being order to self-isolate on arrival in the UK.
The three airlines said in a joint statement: "This would be the most practical and effective solution, and enables 
civil servants to focus on other, more significant issues arising from the pandemic while bringing the UK in line with 
much of Europe which is opening its borders mid-June."
Among the claims made by the airlines in their legal challenge to the quarantine are:
– The guidelines are more stringent than those applied to people confirmed to have Covid-19;
– There was no consultation on scientific evidence provided for "such a severe policy";
– Foreigners commuting weekly to the UK are exempt.
Most international arrivals into the UK have been required to enter a 14-day quarantine since Monday.
All passengers – bar a handful of exemptions – have to fill out an online locator form giving their contact and travel 
details, as well as the address of where they will isolate.

People who fail to comply can be fined GBP1,000 in England, and police are allowed to use "reasonable force" to 
make sure they follow the rules.
Border Force officers are carrying out checks on arrivals and can refuse entry to a non-resident foreign national 
who refuses to comply with the regulations.
Failure to complete the locator form is punishable by a GBP100 fixed penalty notice.
In addition to complaints from the travel industry, the scheme has been met with strong criticism from opposition 
parties and some Conservative MPs.
Home Secretary Priti Patel has insisted the policy can "help stop a devastating second wave" of coronavirus.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London were higher at midday on Friday, shrugging off dismal economic growth 
figures which showed the UK economy shrank by 20% in April at the height of the coronavirus lockdown - the worst 
slump since records began.
The large-cap FTSE 100 index was up 75.47 points, or 1.2%, at 6,152.17 on Friday - but still is on track to end the 
week down almost 3%.
The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was up 244.52 points, or 1.3% at 17,218.19. The AIM All-Share index was up 1.79 
points, or 0.2% at 867.40.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 1.1% at 10,423.08. The Cboe 250 was up 1.4% at 14,802.35, and the Cboe Small 
Companies up 0.5% at 9,681.71.
Markets elsewhere in Europe also were rallying. In Paris the CAC 40 was up 1.9%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt 
was up 1.3%. 
"The FTSE 100, packed with multinational companies, is not really a barometer for the UK economy but even the 
more domestic-facing FTSE 250 did not suffer severe damage. Investors are not stupid, they know April was 
arguably the height of the lockdown. The unprecedented nature of the fall in economic activity just mirrored the 
unprecedented act of effectively shutting down a modern economy," commented AJ Bell's Russ Mould.
On the London Stock Exchange, Pearson was the best blue-chip performer, up 13%. 
Activist investor Cevian Capital has built a stake in the education publisher, according to a regulatory filing on 
Thursday. Cevian Capital II holds a 5.4% stake in Pearson, according to the filing, equal to 40.6 million shares.

Informa was up 10%. The business events and publishing company said trading has remained mixed, with the 
Events division hammered by cancellations due to government-imposed lockdowns across the world, while the 
Subscriptions unit continues to trade well. 
The London-based company said its Subscriptions unit - which makes up 35% of revenue - continues to perform 
"resiliently". The Events unit - contributing 65% of revenue - is focusing on providing alternative digital services, as 
no physical product has been offered anywhere in the world due to Covid-19. 
Informa noted the Events unit is focusing on "long-term relationships ahead of short-term revenue", but added the 
return of events in China is now a "real" possibility. The company has scheduled a minimal physical product for 
June but is now planning to run a number of major events in China from early July, with China Beauty Expo in 
Shanghai the first scheduled major Informa event to be held post-Covid-19.
easyJet, Ryanair Holdings and International Consolidated Airlines Group's British Airways have launched legal 
action against the UK government's "flawed" 14-day quarantine policy.
easyJet and IAG were up 8.5% and 5.5%, respectively, while Ryanair was up 1.7%.
The airlines said they have asked for a judicial review to be heard "as soon as possible", claiming the measures 
introduced this week will have a "devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy". Most international 
arrivals into the UK have been required to enter a 14-day quarantine since Monday.
At the other end of the large-cap index, Russian gold miner Polymetal International was down 2.3%, tracking spot 
gold prices lower.
Gold was quoted at USD1,733.06 an ounce at midday, down from USD1,742.15 late Thursday.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2652 at midday, firm from USD1.2642 at the London equities close on Thursday, 
shrugging off dismal UK economic data.
The UK economy shrank by a fifth in the month of April, according to the latest figures from the Office for National 
Statistics.
Gross domestic product slumped 20% month-on-month in April, the biggest monthly fall since the series began - far 
steeper than the falls of 5.8% and 0.2% seen in March and February respectively. In the three months to April, the 
economy contracted an "unprecedented" 10% on a sequential basis.
The latest release captures the direct effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and government measures taken to stem its 
spread.
Rupert Thompson, chief investment officer at wealth manager Kingswood, said: "The record 20.4% drop in UK GDP 
in April followed a 5.8% fall in March and confirms the UK is likely to be one of the economies worst hit by the 
pandemic. Indeed the OECD only this week forecasted the economy would shrink by 11.4% over the year as a 
whole, a larger decline than any other developed economy. Activity will now have started to recover but hopes of a 
rapid bounce-back look misplaced."
The euro stood at USD1.1324 at midday, down from USD1.1377 at the European equities close Thursday after 
eurozone industrial production continued to fall steeply in April, data from Eurostat showed.
Industrial production plunged by 17% month-over-month in April following a 12% monthly fall in March and 
compared to market forecasts according to FXStreet of a 20% drop.
On an annual basis, industrial output in the eurozone collapsed by 28% in April following a drop of 14% in March, 
while economists expected a fall of 30%.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Stocks Unperturbed By Record Plunge In UK GDP
The monthly drop was the biggest ever recorded in eurozone industrial production and significantly higher than the 
declines seen in late 2008 and early 2009, during the financial crisis, as coronavirus containment measures forced 
businesses and factories closures, the EU statistics office said.
Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY107.53 at midday, up from JPY107.20 late Thursday in London.
Brent oil was quoted at USD38.96 a barrel at midday, firm from USD38.70 at the London close on Thursday.
Stocks in New York look set for a strong open on Friday after spiking coronavirus cases in several US states 
prompted on Thursday the worst sell-off since March, when market turmoil over Covid-19 was at its peak.
The DJIA called was called up 2.3%, the S&P 500 index up 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.7%.
On Thursday, figures showing a spike in new infections in key states including Texas, California, Arizona and 
Florida, fanned concerns of a new wave as the nation slowly reopens.
However, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday said there would be no more shutdowns, telling 
CNBC: "I think we've learned that if you shut down the economy, you're going to create more damage."
White House officials have played down the severity of the virus surge, which they sought to blame on factors 
beyond President Donald Trump's forceful push to reopen the economy, which he is counting on to help him win 
reelection in November.
IG Group said: "The potential for Trump to allow a second wave to go unchecked in the name of preserving 
economic growth provides yet another key reason to doubt his re-election chances come November. Pricing around 
the US election has swung heavily towards [Democratic nominee] Joe Biden, and the potential of an unimpeded 
surge in coronavirus deaths will do little to boost optimism for Trump's re-election. 
"From a market perspective, the outcome of November's election has huge consequences, with the market 
outperformance under his leadership providing clues as to how people view the impact of his 'America First' 
approach. However, while Trump's focus on the economy has been great for US stock markets over the years, it 
could also be his downfall if he chooses to ignore a second wave."

COMPANIES

Informa said trading remained mixed with the Events division hammered by cancellations due to government-
imposed lockdowns across the world, while the Subscriptions unit continuing to trade well. "We expect the pace and 
shape of recovery to be gradual and phased by market. Despite continued near-term unpredictability, our 
strengthened balance sheet, continuing cost controls and strong liquidity is enabling us to focus on the other side of 
Covid-19," Chief Executive Stephen Carter said in his annual general meeting statement. The London-based 
business publisher and exhibitions organiser said its Subscriptions unit - which makes up 35% of revenue - 
continues to perform "resiliently" but its Events unit - 65% of revenue - is focusing on providing alternative digital

Carnival said Holland America Line has extended its pause on cruise operations and is cancelling further 
departures from the port of Vancouver in 2020 as well as some Hawaii itineraries for early 2021.

MARKETS
----------
Stocks in London rebounded on Friday, looking to end a gloomy week on a high note.
"Stocks are heading higher as the uncertainty around a second wave provides a volatile market environment. With 
Trump promising to avoid a second lockdown, the coming months could be key for his hopes of re-election," IG 
Senior Market Analyst Joshua Mahony said.
"Markets appear to have stabilised after yesterday's crash in global equities, with traders attempting to figure out 
whether this is finally the beginning of the second major selloff. We appear to be shifting from a phase where 
everyone looks towards the reopening as a cause for optimism, to one where we begin to refocus on Covid case 
numbers with trepidation."
In the US - following Thursday's drastic sell-off - Wall Street is set to claw back some losses. The Dow Jones 
Industrial Average is pointed 2.2% higher, the S&P 500 up 1.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.5%.

FTSE 100: up 77.69 points, or 1.3%, at 6,154.39

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK economy shrank by a fifth in the month of April, according to the latest figures from the Office for National 
Statistics. Gross domestic product slumped 20% month-on-month in April, the biggest monthly fall since the series 
began - far steeper than the falls of 5.8% and 0.2% seen in March and February respectively. In the three months to 
April, the economy contracted an "unpredecented" 10% on a sequential basis. The latest release captures the 
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: BA , easyJet And Ryanair Launch Action Against UK
direct effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and government measures taken to stem its spread. The ONS noted in a 
separate release that April's GDP decline was three times greater than the fall experienced during the 2008 to 2009 
economic downturn. Throughout the 2008 recession, GDP shrunk by no more than 2.1% in a single quarter.
----------
The jobs market in the UK is slowly improving, but sectors including hospitality are continuing to be hit by the 
coronavirus crisis, a new study suggests. The number of jobs on offer increased by 13,000 to 963,000 in the past 
month, said the Recruitment & Employment Confederation. In the first week of June there were 112,000 job 
adverts, up by 64% from the last week of May, suggesting more companies are starting to hire again, said the 
report. Scotland and Wales are leading the recovery, with job postings rising by 3.6% and 2.3% respectively in 
recent weeks, although they fell in parts of Northern Ireland, South Norfolk and Kent, said the report.
----------
The UK government is expected to backtrack on its plan to introduce full border checks with the EU from January 1 
over fears of the economic impact of coronavirus. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is anticipated to make an 
announcement on Friday over border operations for when Brexit fully comes into effect at the end of the transition 
period. The UK had committed to introduce import controls on EU goods in the new year, but ministers are now 
expected to adopt a more flexible approach to prevent the departure compounding the chaos from Covid-19. Gove 
will have the second joint committee agreed under the Withdrawal Agreement with European Commission vice 
president Maros Sefcovic on Friday. UK sources said that unless both sides agree to another such meeting before 
the end of July, it will be the last opportunity to request an extension to the transition period.
----------
The UK and the EU are due to take stock of progress in their thorny trade negotiations at high-level talks on 
Monday, after several negotiating rounds have delivered little progress to date. Time is ticking towards an end-of-
year deadline when EU rules will stop applying to Britain, following its departure from the bloc on January 31. 
Without a follow-on arrangement, costly trade barriers will spring up overnight, along with other administrative 
hurdles. Monday's talks - via video conference - will be attended by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European 
Council President Charles Michel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European 
Parliament President David Sassoli. The meeting was confirmed by spokespeople in London and Brussels. Besides 
assessing the state of negotiations on a new trade and political relationship, the two sides are also due to discuss 
the option of extending Britain's transition period beyond December 31 - a move that London has already ruled out, 
however.
----------
Japanese industrial production slumped even more than first thought in April, according to data from the Ministry of 
Economy, Trade & Industry. Annually, industrial output was down 15% in April and month-on-month, fell 9.8%. This 
had first been reported as falls of 14% and 9.1% respectively. The index of industrial shipments fell 17% year-on-
year, while inventories rose 2.7%.
----------
North Korea criticised Donald Trump in a stinging denunciation of the US, the second anniversary of a landmark 
summit in Singapore where the US president shook hands with leader Kim Jong Un. It was the latest in a series of 
vitriolic statements from Pyongyang aimed at both Washington and Seoul, and came a day after the North implicitly 
threatened to disrupt November's election if the US did not stay out of inter-Korean affairs. In recent days, 
Pyongyang has excoriated the South over defectors launching leaflets criticising Kim into the North and announced 
it was cutting all official communication links with Seoul. Friday's broadside contained some of the harshest criticism 
Pyongyang has sent Washington's way in recent months, and casts doubt over the future of the two sides' long-
stalled nuclear talks process.

The US has recorded another 941 coronavirus-related fatalities in the last 24 hours, bringing the country's death toll 
so far to 113,774, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The world's top economy is the most affected by 
the pandemic in absolute terms, with both the highest number of deaths and the largest number of infections – 2.0 
million at 0030 GMT Friday, a tracker maintained by the Baltimore-based university showed. The US continues to 
register around 20,000 new cases of coronavirus each day, and is struggling to come down from that plateau as 
infection rates wax and wane around the country. In some more sparsely populated rural regions, the number of 
hospitalisations is climbing compared to a month ago. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday there 
will be no more shutdowns, even as the outbreak flares in some states. "We can't shut down the economy. I think 
we've learned that if you shut down the economy, you're going to create more damage," Mnuchin said in an 
interview on CNBC.

Heathrow Airport Urges UK Government To Rethink Quarantine Strategy

(Alliance News) - Europe's busiest airport on Thursday called on the UK government to establish "air bridges" with 
countries with low Covid-19 infection rates, as travel curbs continued to empty skies and weigh on the travel 
industry in May. 
Numbers from Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd on Thursday showed a 97% year-on-year plunge in May passenger 
numbers to just 228,000. May followed a fall of the same rate in April. 
For the whole of 2020 up until the end of May, passenger numbers were 52% lower at 15.1 million. 
The "grim picture" will persist, the west London airport operator said, due to the UK government's quarantine policy 
which calls on all arriving passengers to self-isolate for two weeks. 
It's a policy that has drawn criticism from some of the biggest names in the travel industry. Ryanair Holdings PLC 
boss Michael O'Leary warned the measures would cost millions of tourism jobs. 
Ryanair joined with rival airlines easyJet PLC and International Consolidated Airlines Group SA in starting legal 
proceedings. 
"Heathrow is urging the government to establish 'air bridges' to low risk countries that will enable the country to 
restart its economy in earnest, protecting livelihoods in aviation and the sectors that rely on it," the company said.
Chief Executive Officer John Holland-Kaye said: "Throughout this crisis, we have tried to protect front line jobs, but 
this is no longer sustainable, and we have now agreed a voluntary severance scheme with our union partners. 
While we cannot rule out further job reductions, we will continue to explore options to minimise the number of job 
losses."

(Alliance News) - Budget airline easyJet PLC may have to cut more jobs thanks to the new UK quarantine for 
international arrivals, Sky News reported Monday.
In an interview with a Sky News reporter, easyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said he "feared" further job 
losses in the company if the quarantine period is longer than expected.
"This is affecting millions of people and it's also affecting the UK vacation industry which has been a leading sector 
across global aviation," Lundgren said.

The 14-day quarantine for international arrivals went into effect on Monday, although major airlines like Ryanair 
Holdings PLC and easyJet have warned the move might hurt tourism and exports.
The UK measures also prevent the use of public transport from the airport and bans attendance at work or school 
while under quarantine. Failure to isolate for the two week period can result in a GBP1,000 fine.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC will not carry out its plan to shutter its loss-making subsidiary 
Lauda in Vienna, the Austrian carrier announced on Monday after employees agreed to a last-minute wage deal.
The management of Ireland-based Ryanair had set several deadlines for Lauda staff to agree to wage cuts and 
threatened to cut all 500 job at the Lauda base in Vienna as the subsidiary would be moved to a new hub.
However, unionists blocked Ryanair's proposal, arguing that the new entry-level wages were below the poverty line.
After union representatives and Austria's chamber of commerce agreed on a new wage cut deal last week, Lauda 
staff approved it in a poll on the weekend.
However, some jobs will be cut, and the number of Lauda's Airbus aircraft in Vienna will be reduced from 16 to 10, 
the Austrian low-cost carrier said in a statement.
"We will need these cost efficiencies if we are to successfully compete against the state subsidised Lufthansa 
subsidiary," Lauda Chief Executives Andreas Gruber and David O'Brien said, in a stab against the government 
bailout of Austrian Airlines.
The Lauda fleet that was grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic will gradually start flying again on July 1.
Ryanair shares closed 0.6% lower at EUR12.80 each in London on Monday.

(Alliance News) - Requiring travellers arriving in the UK to go into quarantine will cost millions of tourism jobs, 
Ryanair Holdings PLC boss Michael O'Leary has warned.
He said his airline is experiencing a "collapse of inward bookings" for flights this summer, because people are being 
told to self-isolate for 14 days under government measures to guard against a second wave of coronavirus.
All passengers, bar a handful of exemptions, now have to fill out an online locator form giving their contact and 
travel details, as well as the address of where they will isolate.
Mr O'Leary told Good Morning Britain: "We're seeing thousands of British families booking their holidays in 
Portugal, in Spain and Italy, but there's almost a collapse of inward bookings bringing those Italians, bringing those 
Europeans here to the UK, on which Britain's tourism industry depends, particularly in the peak months of July and 
August.
"What's irrational about it is all of those countries have a much lower Covid rate than the UK."
He added: "Millions of jobs are going to be lost in British tourism because British hotels, British guest houses, 
British visitor attractions – all over London, the Globe, the London Eye, Madame Tussauds – will be empty, 
because the hundreds of thousands of Italians and Spanish and French people you get coming to Britain every July 
and August simply won't travel."
Ryanair joined with rival airlines easyJet and British Airways in starting legal proceedings over the "disproportionate 
and unfair" policy.
They sent a pre-action letter to the government on Friday, which is the first step in an application for judicial review.
Mark Tanzer, chief executive of travel trade organisation Abta, called on ministers to outline a "coordinated plan" for 
encouraging people to travel to and from the UK.
Quarantine Rules Will Cost Millions Of Jobs, Ryanair Boss Warns
He said: "We must restart international travel as soon as it is safe to do so, and businesses and customers would 
benefit from the Government outlining when this is likely to happen.
"There are many livelihoods at stake, and bookings will only start to pick up in earnest when people and businesses 
have a better idea as to what the Government's plan is to open up the UK and access to international destinations."
People who fail to comply with the new rules could be fined GBP1,000 in England, and police will be allowed to use 
"reasonable force" to make sure they follow the rules.
Border Force officers will carry out checks on arrivals and may refuse entry to a non-resident foreign national who 
refuses to comply with the regulations.
Failure to complete the locator form will be punishable by a GBP100 fixed penalty notice.
Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, said Border Force staff checking quarantine 
papers were "angry" at the way they were being treated.
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that technical papers explaining to staff what to check for only arrived on 
Friday, and were still not available to those operating on the front line of the devolved administrations.
Ms Moreton added: "This does appear to be very shambolic and they don't want to be blamed for that."
A leaked Home Office document seen by The Daily Telegraph reportedly said there was no method for officials to 
ensure a person's details are "genuine".
The quarantine regulations must be reviewed every three weeks, with the first taking place by June 29.
They could be in place for a year, when the legislation expires, unless the Government decides to scrap them 
sooner.
Travellers arriving from within the Common Travel Area, which includes Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel 
Islands, will not need to self-isolate unless they have arrived in the CTA in the last 14 days.
Home Secretary Priti Patel said: "We all want to return to normal as quickly as possible. But this cannot be at the 
expense of lives.
"The science is clear that if we limit the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad, we can help stop a 
devastating second wave.
"That is why the measures coming into force today are necessary. They will help control the virus, protect the NHS 
and save lives".

Measures

(Alliance News) - British Airways has begun legal proceedings over what it calls the UK government's "unlawful" 
quarantine measures, which include 14-days of self-isolation for international arrivals.
BA's parent company International Consolidated Airlines Group SA sent a pre-action letter, which is the first stage 
in a judicial review, to ministers on Friday ahead of the measures coming into effect on Monday.
The letter, seen by The Sunday Times, argues the restrictions are disproportionate.
It states: "In our view, the government has failed to identify a valid justification for the blanket nature of the 
regulations, especially given the extremely severe nature of the self-isolation provisions that apply."
The letter sent to the Procurator General Jonathan Jones was also signed by BA's budget rivals easyJet PLC and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC.
It comes as The Sun reports BA has told pilots' union Balpa all 4,300 of its pilots will be fired and re-hired if current 
employment negotiations break down.
Meanwhile, IAG chief executive Willie Walsh described the government's quarantine policy as "terrible" and warned 
it has "torpedoed our opportunity to get flying in July".
He told Sky News on Friday: "We think it's irrational, we think it's disproportionate, and we are giving consideration 
to a legal challenge to this legislation.
"We're reviewing that with the lawyers later on today.
"I suspect there are other airlines who are doing so because it's important to point out there was no consultation 
with the industry prior to enacting this legislation.
PRESS: BA Begins Legal Proceedings Over "Unlawful" Quarantine Measures
"We do believe it is an irrational piece of legislation."
Downing Street said it would not comment on Friday on the proposed legal action.
From Monday, people arriving in the UK will need to self-isolate for 14 days.
There has been widespread concern that this will cause huge damage to the travel and aviation sectors as they 
recover from the coronavirus outbreak.
Home Secretary Priti Patel has insisted the rule is "backed by the science" and is "essential" to save lives.
IAG had previously said it intends to make "a meaningful return to service" in July.
BA declined to join a meeting between Patel and the travel industry to discuss the quarantine on Thursday.
It is understood the Home Office received no reply from the airline after being invited to the discussion, which was 
attended by several of its competitors including Virgin Atlantic, easyJet and Jet2.
Len McCluskey, general secretary of union Unite, said it was "frankly irresponsible that BA would sit this out".
The airline has announced plans to cut up to 12,000 jobs as part of a restructuring.
It was confirmed by the Bank of England on Thursday that it has lent GBP300 million to IAG as part of its 
emergency pandemic funding.
Meanwhile, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he held on to "hope" that foreign trips would be able to resume 
before the year is out.
Asked whether he would personally be booking a holiday this year, Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 
"Of course we all hope – let's give ourselves some hope here – that by later in the year we will have continued to do 
all the things we have just talked about and got on top of this virus and the signs are in the right direction."
Shapps confirmed ministers were continuing to look at the concept of so-called "air corridors" – allowing travel with 
countries where Covid-19 transmission was low – but said there was no impending announcement to be made.

Face Coverings To Be Mandatory On Public Transport In England

(Alliance News) - Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from June 15, Transport 
Secretary Grant Shapps has announced.
Shapps said "we need to ensure every precaution is taken" on buses, trains, aircraft and ferries as further lockdown 
measures are eased and passenger numbers increase.
Currently passengers are advised to wear a face covering but are not stopped from travelling without one.
Face coverings can be a scarf, piece of cloth or mask.
The government says they are "marginally beneficial as a precautionary measure", and states that evidence 
suggests face coverings do not protect the wearer, but may protect other people if he or she is infected.
Surgical masks should be reserved for people who need them for protection while at work such as medical staff, 
according to official advice.
London mayor Sadiq Khan was among those who have been lobbying the government to make face coverings 
mandatory on public transport.
He recently said he may introduce the policy for Transport for London services, but was wary about causing 
"confusion".
Transport unions also urged ministers to enforce the wearing of face coverings after the deaths of dozens of 
workers.
Shapps said on May 12 that 42 TfL workers and 10 mainline rail staff had died after being infected by coronavirus.
People are advised to wash their hands or use hand sanitiser before a face covering is put on or taken off, and 
coverings should also be washed regularly.
Face Coverings To Be Mandatory On Public Transport In England
The announcement came as ministers were facing more pressure over the planned blanket quarantine for travellers 
to the UK after an expert questioned the Government's claim that the scheme was "backed by science".
Professor Robert Dingwall, a scientific adviser to the government and member of a sub-group of Sage (Scientific 
Advisory Group for Emergencies), said there was no evidence of new clusters of Covid-19 infection involving 
people who have been travelling abroad.
"I think we would really need to get the level in this country significantly further down before quarantine started to 
become a useful measure.
"That I think, even then, we would have to see something that is targeted on countries with a significantly higher 
level of community transmission than ourselves – and there aren't too many of those around, I'm afraid."
The travel industry pressed home its message that the quarantine plan risked worsening the economic pain by 
hampering attempts to get people moving again and taking holidays, with Ryanair Holdings PLC boss Michael 
O'Leary saying the plans would "do untold damage to British tourism".
But Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis defended the quarantine policy, insisting it was "the right time to do 
it".

Airlines Handed GBP1.8 Billion In UK Emergency Coronavirus Loans

(Alliance News) - The Bank of England has lent nearly GBP2 billion to some of Britain's biggest airlines and paid 
GBP1 billion to a German chemicals giant as part of its emergency pandemic funding, it has been revealed.
Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC have won loans of GBP600 million each, with BA owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group SA and Wizz Air Holdings PLC both accessing GBP300 million, raising concerns from 
environmental campaigners who want the loans to come with strings attached.
The central bank revealed 53 businesses had borrowed a total of GBP16.25 billion under the scheme, as it 
published a full list of all borrowers on Thursday.
Other familiar names include ASOS PLC, Nissan Motor Co, John Lewis Partnership, G4S PLCand Tottenham 
Hotspur.
The north London football club is the only team to use the loan scheme and the move follows criticism earlier this 
year when bosses initially said they would be using the government furlough scheme for non-playing staff.
Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC was revealed to have taken a GBP300 million loan from the bank just a month after the 
engine maker said it was cutting at least 9,000 jobs.
Its annual report shows that chief executive Warren East was paid GBP3.2 million in total pay last year, including 
GBP2 million in annual bonus and long-term incentive scheme shares.
It raised questions from campaigners about what companies the authorities should be propping up, and what it 
should expect in return.
"Many of these companies have a poor record in terms of excessive executive pay at the top, poverty wages for 
their wider workforce and unsustainable environmental practices," said Luke Hildyard at the High Pay Centre.
Airlines Handed GBP1.8 Billion In UK Emergency Coronavirus Loans
He added: "It's senseless for public bodies to prop up businesses without securing commitments to act in the public 
interest. If we want to build back better, with a more resilient economic model, a more united society and a more 
sustainable approach to the environment then bailouts and Government loans need to be deployed more 
thoughtfully."
The biggest single loan, GBP1 billion, has gone to German company BASF SE – the world's largest chemicals 
producer.
The chief executive of Rentokil Initial PLC, whose business has borrowed GBP600 million from the scheme, was 
handed GBP4.6 million in total pay last year. This included a GBP3.6 million annual bonus and share incentive.
The list also includes defence company Chemring Group PLC and paint giant Akzo Nobel.
On Wednesday environmental group ClientEarth called on the government not to back loans to companies without 
putting emissions criteria in place.
Greenpeace climate campaigner Fiona Nicholls said: "Airlines have been given exactly what the Chancellor, the 
Prime Minister, economists and the public said they should not be given – billions in cheap and easy loans to keep 
them polluting, without any commitments to reduce their emissions or even keep their workers on the payroll.
"Today we've learned that cruise lines, pesticides and car companies have received similar largesse. We should 
see a lot more public benefit from all this public money."
ClientEarth Chief Executive James Thornton said: "It appears the peak of the virus has passed for now, but we 
simply cannot put on hold our response to climate change while we deal with the pandemic.
"On the contrary, the recovery allows the government to kick-start the UK's economy in a way which ensures long-
term resilience and a more fair and just transition to a net zero economy."
The Bank of England's Covid Corporate Financing Facility was set up to help larger businesses with credit scores 
through the pandemic.
It complements three other loan support schemes, where the loans are provided by high street lenders, and 
guaranteed by the Government.
Even before the list was published, Dame Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP and former chair of the Public Accounts 
Committee, had called on the government to publish even more data on other loan schemes.
She also said that the government should not lend to companies who might not be paying their fair share of tax.
"While for many these schemes will be a financial lifeline, for unscrupulous corporations they will be viewed as easy 
pickings," she wrote in a letter to chancellor Rishi Sunak.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has described the UK's quarantine as "utterly ineffective", claiming people 
can be playing golf or lying on a beach when telephone checks are made.
The airline claimed quarantines can only work when passengers are "detained" at their point of arrival.
It said in a statement that the UK plans to allow people to travel on public transport across the country, and there is 
"nothing to stop" them shopping in a supermarket to collect groceries before their 14-day quarantine begins.
The airline went on: "Once they have arrived at their 'quarantine address', the UK Government will phone less than 
1% of these visitors but only on their mobile phone, which can be answered from any golf course, beach, park or 
indeed supermarket across the UK, thereby rendering this quarantine utterly ineffective and useless.
"For the UK to be imposing a 14-day quarantine on inbound visitors when it already has one of the worst Covid 
infection and death rates in Europe, is closing the door long after the horse has bolted.
"Most visitors to the UK from Europe are arriving from countries with a lower R rate than the UK."
Earlier Wednesday, the Irish budget airline reported practically no passenger traffic in May amid travel restrictions 
caused by Covid-19, saying it expects little to change in June.
Ryanair said traffic in May dropped by 99.5% to just 70,000 passengers versus the 14.1 million passengers it 
carried a year earlier, as Covid-19 airspace closures continue to hurt its operations.
Ryanair said it operated just 701 scheduled flights in May, including a number of rescue and medical flights on 
behalf of various EU governments, versus its budgeted schedule of 70,000 flights.
Going forward, Ryanair said it expects minimal traffic in June, due to multiple EU government flight bans and 
restrictions.

(Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings on Wednesday reported practically no passenger traffic in 
May amid travel restrictions to combat Covid-19, saying it expects little to change in June.
Ryanair said traffic in May dropped by 99.5% to just 70,000 passengers versus the 14.1 million passengers it

UK shop prices suffered another notable decline in May, with non-essential retail again experiencing a bruising 
month due to high levels of promotional activity. The British Retail Consortium-Nielsen shop price index showed a 
2.4% annual fall in May, worse than the 1.7% slip recorded in April. The May decline was the fastest since the index 
began in December 2006 and it also towered above the 12-month average decrease of 0.7% and the six-month 
average fall of 1.0%. Food inflation eased to 1.5% in May, down from 1.8% in April, BRC noted, though in-line with 
the six month and 12-month averages. Non-food retailers had a tough month however, shop prices slumped by 
4.6% year-on-year in May, after a 3.7% fall in April.

Budapest, Hungary-based company said it carried 40.0 million passengers in the recent financial year, a 16% 
increase from 34.6 million the year before. Revenue grew 19% to EUR2.76 billion. Ticket revenue per passenger 
fell by 4.6% to EUR37.7, Wizz Air noted, but it said ancillary revenue per passenger increased by 14% to EUR31.3 
per passenger. The company said it expanded its fleet by 9 aircraft during the year to 121 aircraft, with over 47% of 
seats now served by the more cost-effective A321 type aircraft. The current average aircraft age of Wizz Air is 5.4 
years. "We have taken various initiatives during the Covid-19 pandemic to safeguard the company's cost position

SSP Group - which operates catering and retail units at airports - reported a 3.7% fall in revenue to GBP1.22 billion 
in the six months to the end of March. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined by 2.7%. SSP said like-for-
like sales were down 8.4%, heavily hurt by Covid-19 and the closure of most of the global travel markets during 
March. As a result, the company said it swung to a pretax loss of GBP34.3 million compared with a GBP51.4 million 
profit a year prior. SSP declared no interim 2020 dividend and suspended its share buyback programme. "Covid-19 
has had an unprecedented impact on the travel sector. Our response has been to take quick and decisive action to 
protect our people and our business, whilst around the world our colleagues have helped and supported their local 
communities," explained Chief Executive Simon Smith. In addition, SSP said it intends to conduct a 
non‑pre‑emptive placing of new shares to allow shareholders entitled to the 2019 final dividend to re-invest it back 
in to the company. SSP's final dividend of 6.0 pence per share will be paid on Thursday. Together, the total 
LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair Carries Hardly Any Passengers In May
proceeds from the fundraising will not exceed GBP26.8 million, SSP said, being the total value of the 2019 final

Defence technology firm Chemring reported 37% revenue growth in the six months to the end of April to GBP191.0 
million, taking pretax profit up to GBP19.0 million from GBP4.3 million a year ago. Chemring increased its interim 
payout by 8% to 1.3 pence a share. The company said its performance in the first half of its current financial year 
was ahead of expectations, reflecting strong performance in both segments and some positive timing differences. 
Chemring reported good progress in securing new business in the UK, US and Australia for the supply of global 
countermeasures. Looking forward, Chemring said all of its businesses have remained open despite the challenges 
presented by Covid-19. Its full-year expectations are unchanged, despite the challenging environment, with about 
95% of expected second-half revenue in the order book or has been delivered to date.

International Consolidated Airlines Group-owned Iberia protested Tuesday after the Spanish government pledged to 
sue 17 airlines for failing to inform travellers about their right to a refund for flights cancelled during the pandemic, 
AFP reports. A day after the consumer affairs ministry said it would take legal action, the Spanish carrier hit back. 
"Iberia and Iberia Express inform customers clearly about their rights," it said. Under European law, when a flight is 
cancelled, passengers must be offered an alternative flight or a refund. The refund may be voucher, but only if the 
customer consents, the European Commission clarified last month. "Shortcomings in the information provided on 
customers' rights following the cancellation of flights," led to the legal action, the ministry said. Iberia said it was 
"bewildered" by the allegations and denounced the "very damaging effects" of such a move on both its reputation 
and "financial ability to overcome the current paralysis". Companies to be named in the lawsuit are Air Europa, Air 
France KLM, Binter Canarias, easyJet, Eurowings, Iberia, Jet 2, KLM, Latam Airlines, Deutsche Lufthansa, Ryanair 
Holdings, Scandinavian Airlines, Transavia, UI AG, United Airlines Holdings, Volotea and Wizzair Holdings.

Nissan Motor has warned it will not be able to sustain operations at its Sunderland manufacturing plant if Brexit

facility. A Nissan spokesman said at the time that "Sunderland (remained) an important part of our plans for the 
European business." But in an interview with the BBC, Nissan's global chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta 
warned the company would not be able to stand by its commitment to the Sunderland plant if the UK left the EU 
without a trade deal that enabled tariff-free EU access.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are set to open higher on Wednesday, following positive trading in Asia 
overnight, boosted by a big improvement in the latest services PMI reading from China, the best since October 
2010.
In early company news, budget airline Ryanair reported practically no passenger traffic in May amid travel 
restrictions caused by Covid-19, saying it expects little to change in June. Smaller peer Wizz Air reported double-
digit profit growth in its financial year ended March 31. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 64.76 points higher at 6,284.90 on Wednesday. 
The FTSE 100 index closed up 53.72 points, or 0.9%, at 6,220.14 on Tuesday.
In New York on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 1.1%, the S&P 500 up 0.8%, and the Nasdaq 
Composite up 0.6%.
The novel coronavirus killed another 1,081 people in the US in the 24 hours leading up to 0030 GMT Tuesday, 
according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That means 106,180 people have so far officially died from the 
virus out of 1.8 million official cases, according to the Baltimore-based school. 
The virus has killed at least 379,585 people worldwide since it appeared in China late last year, according to a 
count by AFP. 
Every American state has to some degree begun relaxing containment measures to stop the spread of the virus. 
But dozens of major cities have instituted night-time curfews in recent days to deal with the unrest that has swept 
the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man who was asphyxiated by a white police officer last 
week in Minneapolis. 
"US stocks appear to be putting to one side the night-time curfews as well as the prospect that the US military might 
have to take to the streets of US cities, if US governors can't deal with the unrest currently sweeping across their 
states," said CMC Markets UK analyst Michael Hewson.

"None of these concerns prevented US markets closing at their best levels in three months, following from similarly 
positive Asia and European sessions, and this looks set to continue this morning, in the wake of another strong Asia 
session," added Hewson.
In Asia on Wednesday, Nikkei 225 index in Tokyo closed up 1.3%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.1%, 
while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 1.3%.  
China's services sector moved into expansion in May for the first time since the start of 2020, data from Caixin 
showed, as business activity and new work rose at the quickest rate since late 2010.
The seasonally adjusted headline business activity index jumped to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, reflecting 
expansion since January, when the index read 51.1 before falling to a record low of 26.5 in February.
Due to the easing of lockdown restrictions related to the Covid-19 outbreak, business operations in China were 
allowed to resume and client demand improved, with business activity and new orders expanding at the fastest rate 
since September 2010, supported by firmer domestic demand.
Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY108.55, unchanged from Tuesday. The euro traded at USD1.1202 
early Wednesday, down from USD1.1210.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.2584 early Wednesday, firm than USD1.2535 at the London equities close on 
Tuesday.
Ryanair Holdings said its traffic in May dropped by 99.5% to 70,000 passengers versus the 14.1 million passengers 
it carried a year earlier, as Covid-19 airspace closures continue to hurt its operations. 
Ryanair said it operated just 701 scheduled flights in May, including a number of rescue and medical flights on 
behalf of various EU governments, versus its budgeted schedule of 70,000 flights. 
Going forward, Ryanair said it expects minimal traffic in June, due to multiple EU government flight bans and 
restrictions.
Eastern Europe-focused Wizz Air reported record underlying profit of EUR344.8 million for the financial year to the 
end of March, up 30% on the prior year. Pretax profit also jumped, to EUR294.1 million from EUR128.9 million. 
The Budapest, Hungary-based company said it carried 40.0 million passengers in the recent financial year, a 16% 
increase from 34.6 million the year before. Revenue grew 19% to EUR2.76 billion. 
Ticket revenue per passenger fell by 4.6% to EUR37.7, Wizz Air noted, but it said ancillary revenue per passenger 
increased by 14% to EUR31.3 per passenger.
The company said it expanded its fleet by 9 aircraft during the year to 121 aircraft, with over 47% of seats now 
served by the more cost-effective A321 type aircraft. The current average aircraft age of Wizz Air is 5.4 years.
"We have taken various initiatives during the Covid-19 pandemic to safeguard the company's cost position and 
excellent balance sheet with EUR1.5 billion of cash, one of the strongest in the airline industry," said Chief 
Executive Jozsef Varadi.
"It is too early to provide a detailed outlook for financial 2021 due to the ongoing uncertainty caused by Covid-19. 
However, Wizz Air's market positioning and our ever-disciplined attitude to cost mean that we will emerge from this 
crisis as an even more formidable business and will continue to deliver significant shareholder value, environmental 
benefits and employment opportunities for years to come," added Varadi. 
SSP Group - which operates catering and retail units at airports - reported a 3.7% fall in revenue to GBP1.22 billion 
in the six months to the end of March. On a constant currency basis, revenue declined by 2.7%. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Wizz Air Profit Up In Year To March
SSP said like-for-like sales were down 8.4%, heavily hurt by Covid-19 and the closure of most of the global travel 
markets during March.
As a result, the company said it swung to a pretax loss of GBP34.3 million compared with a GBP51.4 million profit a 
year prior. 
SSP declared no interim 2020 dividend and suspended its share buyback programme.
"Covid-19 has had an unprecedented impact on the travel sector. Our response has been to take quick and 
decisive action to protect our people and our business, whilst around the world our colleagues have helped and 
supported their local communities," explained Chief Executive Simon Smith. 
In addition, SSP said it intends to conduct a non‑pre‑emptive placing of new shares to allow shareholders entitled to 
the 2019 final dividend to re-invest it back in to the company. 
SSP's final dividend of 6.0 pence per share - which was approved by SSP's shareholders at the company's AGM on 
February 26 - with a record date of March 6, will be paid on Thursday.
Together, the total proceeds from the fundraising will not exceed GBP26.8 million, SSP said, being the total value of 
the 2019 final dividend. SSP said the share issue will allow it to retain within the company some of the cash due to 
be paid out.
Defence technology firm Chemring reported 37% revenue growth in the six months to the end of April to GBP191.0 
million, taking pretax profit up to GBP19.0 million from GBP4.3 million a year ago. 
Chemring increased its interim payout by 8% to 1.3 pence a share. 
The company said its performance in the first half of its current financial year was ahead of expectations, reflecting 
strong performance in both segments and some positive timing differences.
Chemring reported good progress in securing new business in the UK, US and Australia for the supply of global 
countermeasures. 
Looking forward, Chemring said all of its businesses have remained open despite the challenges presented by 
Covid-19. Its full-year expectations are unchanged, despite the challenging environment, with about 95% of 
expected second-half revenue in the order book or has been delivered to date.
Gold was priced at USD1,723.94 an ounce early Wednesday, lower than USD1,738.21 on Tuesday. Brent oil was 
trading at USD40.1 a barrel, higher than USD39.20.
The economic events calendar on Wednesday has services PMI readings from Germany, the eurozone, UK and the 
US at 0855 BST, 0900 BST, 0930 BST and 1445 BST respectively.

COMPANIES

Ryanair Holdings reported practically no passenger traffic in May amid travel restrictions caused by Covid-19, 
saying it expects little to change in June. Ryanair said traffic in May dropped by 99.5% to just 70,000 passengers 
versus the 14.1 million passengers it carried a year earlier, as Covid-19 airspace closures continue to hurt its 
operations. Ryanair said it operated just 701 scheduled flights in May, including a number of rescue and medical

annual basis to May, the company said it carried 121.0 million passengers, down 17% from 145.8 million a year 
prior.

Wizz Air Holdings reported a rise in its earnings for financial 2020 due to expansion of operations and an "industry-
leading passenger growth rate of 16%". For the year to March 31, Wizz Air posted revenue of EUR2.76 billion, a 
19% rise from EUR2.32 billion reported for financial 2019. Pretax profit was EUR294.1 million, up from EUR128.9 
million. The Budapest, Hungary-based company said it carried 40.0 million passengers in the recent financial year, 
a 16% increase from 34.6 million the year before. Ticket revenue per passenger fell by 4.6% to EUR37.7, Wizz Air 
noted, but it said ancillary revenue per passenger increased by 14% to EUR31.3 per passenger. Total ancillary 
revenue was up 32% year-on-year at EUR1.25 billion. Looking ahead, the company said it is not in a position to

give guidance on net profit at this point due to the continued uncertainty regarding coronavirus, but it remains 
confident in its ability to thrive through the Covid-19 pandemic. It also said it has hired Charlotte Pedersen as a non-
executive director and that Susan Hooper will retire as a director effective immediately.

International Consolidated Airlines Group-owned Iberia protested Tuesday after the Spanish government pledged to 
sue 17 airlines for failing to inform travellers about their right to a refund for flights cancelled during the pandemic. A 
day after the consumer affairs ministry said it would take legal action, the Spanish carrier hit back. "Iberia and Iberia 
Express inform customers clearly about their rights," it said. Under European law, when a flight is cancelled, 
passengers must be offered an alternative flight or a refund. The refund may be voucher, but only if the customer 
consents, the European Commission clarified last month. "Shortcomings in the information provided on customers' 
rights following the cancellation of flights," led to  the legal action, the ministry said. "The misleading omission of 
information by airlines in offering vouchers (as the only option) constitutes unfair trading involving a clear lack of 
consent as well as a breach of the law," a statement said. Other carriers to be named in the lawsuit are Air Europa, 
Air France KLM, Binter Canarias, easyJet, Eurowings, Dart Group's Jet2, Latam Airlines, Deutsche Lufthansa, 
Ryanair Holdings, Scandinavian Airlines, Transavia, TUI, United Airlines Holdings, Volotea and Wizz Air.

Japanese car maker Nissan Motor has warned it will not be able to sustain operations at its Sunderland 
manufacturing plant if Brexit negotiations fail to establish a trade deal. The 7,000 workers of the UK's largest car 
manufacturing plant rejoiced last week after surviving a global cost-cutting restructuring that saw the closure of the 
Japanese firm's Barcelona facility. A Nissan spokesman said at the time that "Sunderland [remained] an important 
part of our plans for the European business." But in an interview with the BBC, Nissan's global chief operating 
officer, Ashwani Gupta, warned the company would not be able to stand by its commitment to the Sunderland plant 
if the UK left the EU without a trade deal that enabled tariff-free EU access.

MARKETS

Stocks in London were trading higher on Wednesday, with investors feeling reassured by the gradual reopening for 
business of the global economies. "Stocks opened higher not only in Europe but almost everywhere around the 
globe as investors' risk appetite continues to grow in the middle of the week," said ActiveTrades analyst Pierre 
Veyret. Stocks in the US were pointed to the higher open, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average called up 0.7%, 
the S&P 500 up 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.3%.

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK private sector activity in May improved from record lows in April, but remained in contraction as new work and 
employment in the services sector continued to fall, survey data from IHS Markit showed. The IHS Markit/Chartered 
Institute of Procurement & Supply composite purchasing managers' index for May rose sharply to 30.0 points from 
a score of 12.9 in April. The services PMI rose to 29.0 in May from 13.4 in April, due to rising client demand as the 
UK economy started to reopen, especially in the construction sector. Market consensus according to FXStreet had 
seen the May services reading at 28.0. Around 54% of UK service providers reported a drop in business activity 
during the month, which was attributed to a severe lack of new business to replace work completed after the 
lockdown, following deep cutbacks to corporate spending in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. By contrast, only 
13% of service providers reported an increase.
----------
Keir Starmer has accused the UK government of "winging it" in its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and told 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson to "get a grip". The Labour leader stepped up his criticism of Johnson's record as he 
prepared to face him at Prime Minister's Questions for the first time since news emerged of the controversial 
lockdown trip made by Dominic Cummings. All eyes will be on the House of Commons at midday to see how the 
prime minister performs opposite the Labour leader, with Johnson likely to be grilled over his support for his senior 
adviser over his decision to take his family 260 miles away to Durham in March to self-isolate. The leaders will 
come face to face on the day the UK coronavirus death toll could reach 50,000, having passed 49,800 on Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, new quarantine restrictions on travellers arriving in the UK will be set out by Home Secretary Priti Patel 
on Wednesday, including requiring the majority of visitors to Britain to self-isolate for 14 days.
----------
The eurozone services sector recovered somewhat in May but still showed severe contraction, survey results from 
IHS Markit showed. The IHS Markit eurozone composite output index came in at 31.9 points in May, its best level in 
three months. It was higher than the flash reading of 30.5 and up on April's 13.6 and March's 29.7. However, the 
purchasing managers' index still remained well below the 50.0 no-change mark. It was again consistent with sharply 
falling activity across the region, as restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic continued to hurt economic 
performance. The four largest euro area economies registered slower – albeit still severe – contractions in activity. 
Italy was the best-performing, followed by Germany and France. Spain remained the weakest-performing nation. 
The services business activity index rose markedly from April's record low of 12.0 to record a three-month high of 
30.5.

China's services sector swung back into expansion in May, data from Caixin showed, as business activity and new 
work rose at the quickest rate since late 2010. The seasonally adjusted headline business activity index rose to 
55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, reflecting the first expansion since January, when the index was at 51.1, before 
falling to a record low of 26.5 in February. Due to the easing of lockdown restrictions related to the Covid-19 
outbreak, business operations were allowed to resume and client demand improved, with business activity and new 
orders expanding at the fastest rate since September 2010, supported by firmer domestic demand. However, the 
pandemic still had a detrimental impact on new export work, which continued to fall. In addition, companies are still 
reducing their staffing levels; however the rate of job shedding was the slowest in four months. Business confidence 
across China's service sector remained strong in May, despite softening since the prior month.
----------
The German government has approved the lifting of travel warnings for 29 European countries, to take effect on 
June 15, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. The warnings - imposed worldwide in March due to the coronavirus 
outbreak - are set to be lifted for Germany's 26 fellow EU member states apart from Spain where restrictions on 
visitors will extend beyond June 15. Britain and three non-EU members of the borderless Schengen zone - Iceland, 
Switzerland and Liechtenstein - also will see the German warnings lifted, according to a document approved at a 
cabinet meeting in Berlin on Wednesday. Like Spain, Norway - the fourth non-EU Schengen member - has 
restrictions on arrivals in place beyond June 15, so is not included. Italy also reopened its borders to visitors from 
the rest of the EU and dropped a ban on travel between its regions. The relaxation of novel coronavirus 
containment measures came amid a steady drop in infection numbers and pressure to reopen the economy after 
strict lockdown measures.

"The misleading omission of information by airlines in offering vouchers (as the only option) constitutes unfair 
trading involving a clear lack of consent as well as a breach of the law," a statement said.
Iberia said it was "bewildered" by the allegations and denounced the "very damaging effects" of such a move on 
both its reputation and "financial ability to overcome the current paralysis".
Companies to be named in the lawsuit are Air Europa, Air France KLM SA, Binter Canarias, EasyJet PLC, 
Eurowings, Iberia, Jet 2, KLM, Latam Airlines, Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Ryanair Holdings PLC, Scandinavian 
Airlines, Transavia, UI AG, United Airlines Holdings Inc, Volotea and Wizzair Holdings PLC.
"Refunds are always possible. This option has been clearly offered to our customers," Germany's Lufthansa told 
AFP. 
"But it must be understood that refunds are not being paid out within the normal timeframe," it said.

The refund issue has become a political hot potato in the EU. 
At the end of April, 12 European states including France – but not Spain – asked the bloc to suspend the law 
requiring airlines to offer full refunds for flights cancelled due to the crisis. 
But the Commission said airlines must offer refunds and cannot force passengers to accept vouchers, while 
suggesting they incentivise vouchers as a way to support the hard-hit tourism sector. 
French consumer rights group UFC-Que Choisir also said in May it would file a legal complaint against 20 airlines 
for failing to reimburse customers for cancelled flights.
With the near freezing of international traffic, airlines face an unprecedented financial crisis. Industry body 
Airlines for Europe says EUR9.2 billion had been lost in unused tickets by the end of May. 
The International Air Transport Association gave a similar estimate, saying unused tickets amounted to some 
USD10 billion in Europe and USD35 billion globally.

France Slams Ryanair "Blackmail" Over Job Ultimatum
France Slams Ryanair "Blackmail" Over Job Ultimatum

(Alliance News) - France on Tuesday denounced as "blackmail" an ultimatum from low-cost carrier Ryanair 
Holdings PLC for its French employees to choose between a five-year pay cut or a number of redundancies in an 
escalating labour dispute.
The offer from the Dublin-based no-frills carrier, long accused by critics of abrasive labour tactics, comes as the 
aviation industry grapples with an unprecedented crisis after the collapse in global demand for air travel due to the 
coronavirus.
"Blackmail is never an option," Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told RTL radio. "Jobs will be protected by 
imaginative solutions, but definitely not through blackmail," he said. 
The aviation industry is facing drastic losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has closed borders across the 
world and paralysed air transport.
Ryanair has already announced plans to axe 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15% of staff across its European 
network.
In France, Ryanair operates from hubs including the Marseille, Toulouse and Bordeaux airports. 
The Irish company has told French unions to accept plans to cut wages by 20% for pilots and 10% for stewards and 
air hostesses from July 2020, or face the redundancy of 23 pilots and 27 cabin crew staff. 
Under current plans, staffers who are earning minimum wage would see their work time cut by 20%. Employees 
would progressively regain their salary up until 2025. 
Labour Minister Muriel Penicaud said she was "shocked" by Ryanair's proposal and said the company must go 
back to the drawing board and "really talk (with employees), but not blackmail."
France Slams Ryanair "Blackmail" Over Job Ultimatum
Since 2017 companies can open up talks with its employees on contract hours and salaries in exchange of a 
company's commitment to suspend dismissals, Penicaud said on TV station BFM Business. 
But the spirit of this possibility is "not at all the one being used by Ryanair," she said. 
Ryanair benefited from the state scheme to help companies through the two-month lockdown period by placing 
staffers on partial unemployment, Penicaud said. 
"We helped them and they're not playing the game," she added. 
The head of France's biggest trade union CFDT, Laurent Berger, said Ryanair wasn't showing respect to "its 
employees, nor workers, nor anyone."
Berger called for a boycott of the airline. "Let's stop taking Ryanair to travel," he said, accusing the company of 
"pressuring its employees for years."

14-Day Quarantine Plan In Ireland "Ineffective" – Ryanair Chief Says

(Alliance News) - Government plans to impose a 14-day quarantine on overseas travellers arriving in Ireland have 
been described as "ineffective" by the chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC.
Michael O'Leary has called for the Dublin government to halt the new regulation, which is set to come into effect 
next week.
O'Leary said it has "no basis in science or in health", and accused the government of putting Ireland into lockdown.
The airline said it will start operating almost 1,000 flights a day from July 1 and will put a number of health 
measures in place, including the requirement for all passengers to wear face masks.
Passengers arriving in Ireland will be legally required to complete a locator form under the new rules.
O'Leary said that while the government and health authorities have done a "great job", the country is emerging in a 
"much more conservative and restricted manner" from its lockdown laws compared with most other European 
countries.
"We can and should do more – it's time to get the economy moving," he told RTE's Morning Ireland.
"We're requiring people to quarantine if you come in from countries that have performed better than Ireland, but no 
quarantine if you come from the country that's performed worst.
"The concept of quarantine is completely ineffective if you don't quarantine people at the airport.
"Once you allow them on to Dublin Bus or in a taxi, if you have a coronavirus-positive person then the infection 
spreads.
"A quarantine that is imposed only on after you have used public transport to get to your eventual destination is not 
a quarantine, it's simply political game-play."
14-Day Quarantine Plan In Ireland "Ineffective" – Ryanair Chief Says
He accused the government of imposing the "most stringent" lockdown restrictions of any European country.
"We are being overly conservative, it's time to reward the Irish people with relaxation of these measures," he added.
He said that Irish families have already booked "well-earned" holidays abroad this summer.
The airline has refunded around 400 million euro to its passengers since travel restrictions came into force in 
March.
Chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry has advised against flying.
He told RTE Morning Ireland: "We should take great care before we jump in and reverse those significant gains we 
have made since March in bending and smashing that curve."
"At this point in time we would not be advising people to fly."
Health Minister Simon Harris tweeted on Wednesday morning: "The public health advice is to avoid all non-
essential travel off the island currently – that's what our doctors are telling us in the interests of our health."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday called on the German government to abandon its EUR9 
billion bail out of Deutsche Lufthansa AG after efforts to get the funding package approved hit a snag. 
Irish carrier Ryanair, a frequent critic of what it labels "state-aid doping", called on German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel to abandon the plans. 
"Ryanair today called on Mrs Merkel to scrap this illegal state aid scheme, which the ungrateful Lufthansa has 
clearly rejected. If the German government is serious about restarting air travel to and from Germany, then this 
state aid should be replaced with a different scheme, which would reduce air travel taxes for all airlines operating in 
Germany for the next 24 months," the company said. 
"This would provide Lufthansa, and all other airlines in Germany, with transparent supports, which would comply 
with competition rules, and would encourage all airlines in Germany to return to flying and restore the German 
tourism industry as quickly as possible."
Ryanair took aim at Lufthansa, which it said "refuses to give the German government effective board 
representation" and also "refuses to hand over slots in Frankfurt and Munich, which would promote competition and 
choice to the Lufthansa monopoly in Germany". 
Lufthansa earlier on Wednesday said its supervisory board was unable to approve the German government's EUR9 
billion stabilisation package due to conditions imposed by the European Union.
"The supervisory board has taken note of the conditions currently indicated by the EU Commission. They would 
lead to a weakening of the hub function at Lufthansa's home airports in Frankfurt and Munich. The resulting 
economic impact on the company and on the planned repayment of the stabilisation measures, as well as possible 
alternative scenarios, must be analysed intensively," the airline said.
Ryanair Calls On Merkel To Ditch Bail Out Of "Ungrateful" Lufthansa
Against this backdrop, Lufthansa said the supervisory board was unable to approve the package offered by the 
German government's economic stabilisation fund. Both the fund and Lufthansa's executive board have already 
approved the deal.
"However, the supervisory board continues to regard WSF stabilisation measures as the only viable alternative for 
maintaining solvency," it added.
Lufthansa will not convene an extraordinary general meeting for the implementation of the measures for the time 
being.
Ryanair shares closed 1.4% lower at EUR11.74 each in London on Wednesday. Lufthansa shares closed 0.4%

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday again took aim at state aid in the aviation industry, with 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG in its cross-hairs in the wake of news it agreed a EUR9 billion bailout from the German 
government. 
The Irish budget carrier added that it plans to operate about 40% of its normal July schedule. This followed news 
that Spain would remove travel restrictions on July 1, and Italy, Cyprus, Greece, and Portugal all announced plans 
to reopen for the key summer tourist period. 
Ryanair shares were 10% higher at EUR11.75 each in London on Tuesday afternoon. 
Commenting on the Lufthansa bailout, Ryanair said the cash injection will increase the flag carrier's "monopoly like 
grip on the German air travel market". 
"The German and French governments continue to provide enormous state aid to their companies, many of whom 
do not need it, which distorts competition with other providers across Europe. Non-state aided airlines like Ryanair, 
easyJet PLC, British Airways and others, will now have to compete with Lufthansa in both the short haul and long 
haul markets without equivalent state aid. 
"Whereas Lufthansa can use this latest EUR9 billion subsidy from the German government to engage in below-cost 
selling on its short haul intra-EU routes and its long haul routes."
It's not the first time Ryanair has weighed in on what it labels "state aid doping". 
Earlier in May, Ryanair noted Lufthansa took EUR12.4 billion in aid, and recently renationalised Alitalia received 
EUR3.5 billion in government assistance. With large war chests for these rivals, Ryanair said it expects below-cost 
selling in the year ahead.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Slams Lufthansa Bailout, Confirms July Flying Plan
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday: "Lufthansa is addicted to state aid. Whenever there is a 
crisis, Lufthansa's first reflex is to put its hand in the German government's pocket. While most other EU airlines 
can survive on just payroll support schemes (for which we are extremely grateful), Lufthansa claims it needs 
another EUR9 billion from the German government, EUR1 billion from the Swiss government, EUR800 million from 
the Austrian government, and EUR500 million from the Belgian government as it stumbles around Europe sucking 
up as much state aid as it can possibly gather.
"The German government continues to ignore EU rules when it suits them to subsidise large German companies, 
but then lectures every other EU government about respecting the rules when they ignore them. Ryanair will appeal 
against this latest example of illegal state aid to Lufthansa, which will massively distort competition and level playing 
field into provision of flights to and from Germany for the next five years."
Ryanair said that from July 1, it will offer flights from "all over northern Europe" to key holiday hotspots like Greece, 
Spain and Portugal as nations begin to ease travel curbs made as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
"After four months of lockdown, we welcome these moves by governments in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Spain and 
Cyprus to open their borders, remove travel restrictions and scrap ineffective quarantines. Irish and British families, 
who have been subject to lockdown for the last 10 weeks, can now look forward to booking their much-needed 
family holiday to Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and other Mediterranean destinations, for July and August before 
the schools return in September," O'Leary added.

International Consolidated Airlines, up 20%, easyJet up 19%. The airline operators were higher amid optimism in 
the aviation sector. Foreign visitors to Spain will no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine from July 1, the 
Spanish government has announced on Monday. IAG owns Spain's Iberia and Vueling airlines. In addition, the 
German government and carrier Deutsche Lufthansa have agreed on a much-anticipated EUR9 billion bailout deal 
to help the airline cope with losses from the coronavirus pandemic, both sides announced on Monday. FTSE 250-
listed Anglo-German travel operator TUI was up 33% and Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was up 9.8%. "Strength in 
this sector underscores confidence among investors that economies are reopening, and consumers are keen to 
travel. There is a lot more hope that travel restrictions across Europe will be eased in time for the summer holidays. 
If the summer holiday season can be saved it would be a big plus after most of us wrote it off," said Markets.com 
analyst Neil Wilson.

FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
Aston Martin Lagonda, up 35% at 49.00 pence. The luxury carmaker confirmed Chief Executive Officer Andy 
Palmer has stepped down with immediate effect, and it has appointed Mercedes executive Tobias Moers as his 
replacement. Palmer's position as chief executive has been the subject of speculation since billionaire Lawrence 
Stroll led a consortium that bought a 25% stake in Aston Martin last month, and then sold part of that to another 
consortium led by Mercedes-AMG Formula 1 team principal Toto Wolff. Tuesday's announcement confirmed a 
report in the Financial Times newspaper on Sunday. Moers will be based at Aston Martin's headquarters in 
Gaydon, Warwickshire and will join the company on August 1. He is currently CEO of the AMG sports car arm of 
Mercedes Benz AG, itself part of 4% Aston Martin shareholder Daimler AG. Moers has held that position since 
2013. However, the stock remains 97% lower from its October 2018 initial public offering price of 1,900p.
----------
Stagecoach, up 15%. The transport company's shares were higher after the UK Department for Transport made 
GBP283 million available for the phased increased of bus, tram and light rail services in England. The UK 
government is looking at a phased increase in transport services in England, after normal bus, tram and light rail 
networks across the UK were mostly paused in March as part of the effort to stop the spread of Covid-19. As part of 
this, the Department for Transport has made GBP254 million available for buses and GBP29 million for trams and 
light rail to help increase the frequency and capacity of services. Perth, Scotland-based Stagecoach said: 
"Discussions will continue between the government and industry representatives regarding future arrangements, 
and we will assess the full detail of the government's plans as these are confirmed."
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
Softcat, down 4.8%. The IT infrastructure and services provider said trading in the quarter ended April 30 has been 
"satisfactory". In a brief trading update, Softcat said it saw growth in revenue, gross profit and operating profit in its 
third quarter. Cash receipts from customers have remained broadly in line with normal trends, Softcat added. The 
firm continued: "There remains a high degree of uncertainty in the coming months and Softcat is not immune to the 
challenges faced by the wider economy. However, we have moved seamlessly to a remote working model and the 
board is encouraged by the resilience of the business thus far."
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Foxtons Group, up 3.1%. The estate agent said while it has continued to operate over the phone and online during 
the lockdown in the UK, business has dropped compared to a year ago. Foxtons said for the eight weeks between 
March 23 to May 15, total commissions earned were down by 44% year-on-year with letting commissions falling by 
40%, and sales commissions by 61%. Mortgage broking revenue was down 2%. Foxtons said it plans to begin re-
opening its branches by Friday, adding that it expects all branches to be open by June 1. Furloughed employees 
will be brought back to work on the same date and safety measures - such as social distancing procedures, 
enhanced office cleans, and mandatory Covid-19 training - will be implemented. Looking ahead, Foxtons said that 
while its outlook remains uncertain in relation to annual results and trading performance, it is "pleased" with the 
resilience of the business during the Covid-19 disruption.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened sharply higher on Tuesday after the long UK bank holiday 
weekend, with airlines lifting the FTSE 100 as global travel restrictions begin to ease.
The large-cap index was up 113.98 points, or 1.9%, at 6,107.26. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was up 395.59 
points, or 2.4%, at 16,794.45. The AIM All-Share index was up 1.0% at 851.65.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 1.7% at 10,317.40. The Cboe 250 was up 1.7% at 14,191.25, and the Cboe Small 
Companies was up 0.3% at 8,934.68.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.1%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.7%.
On the London Stock Exchange, British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group was the best 
blue-chip performer, up 17%, while budget airline easyJet was up 11% amid optimism in the aviation sector. In the 
FTSE 250, Anglo-German travel operator TUI was the best performer, up 36%, while Ryanair Holdings was up 
8.7%.
Foreign visitors to Spain will no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine from July 1, the Spanish 
government has announced on Monday. IAG owns Spain's Iberia and Vueling airlines. 
In addition, the German government and carrier Deutsche Lufthansa have agreed on a much-anticipated EUR9 
billion bailout deal to help the airline cope with losses from the coronavirus pandemic, both sides announced on 
Monday.
Lufthansa wants to offer more flights again from June, a spokesman for the German airline told Bild tabloid's 
Sunday edition. Around 20 destinations are to be served again from Frankfurt in the second half of June, the Bild 
report said, including Heraklion on the Greek island of Crete, the Greek island of Rhodes, Dubrovnik in Croatia, 
Faro in Portugal, Venice in Italy, and Ibiza and Malaga in Spain. 
Deutsche Lufthansa was up 6.3% in Frankfurt.

CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson commented about Lufthansa: "The deal still needs to get the nod from the 
European Commission, who might impose a number of conditions in return for its approval, including the surrender 
of key flight slots. These types of rescue usually come with strings attached as UK bank Royal Bank of Scotland 
found when it was bailed out by the UK government in 2008. The bank was forced to sell a number of assets at fire 
sale prices including Worldpay, Direct Line, as well as spending years to try and sell off Williams and Glyns 
branches at a significant cost."
At the other end of the large-cap index, Whitbread was the worst performer, down 6.0% at 2,457.00 pence after 
JPMorgan slashed its price target on the hospitality firm to 2,000p from 2,800p.
In the FTSE 250, Aston Martin Lagonda was up 35% after the luxury carmaker confirmed Chief Executive Officer 
Andy Palmer has stepped down with immediate effect, and it has appointed Mercedes executive Tobias Moers as 
his replacement.
Palmer's position as chief executive has been the subject of speculation since billionaire Lawrence Stroll led a 
consortium that bought a 25% stake in Aston Martin last month, and then sold part of that to another consortium led 
by Mercedes-AMG Formula 1 team principal Toto Wolff.
Tuesday's announcement confirmed a report in the Financial Times newspaper on Sunday.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2264 Tuesday morning, up from USD1.2190 at the London equities close Friday.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 2.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 1.0%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is up 1.9%.
Japan late on Monday lifted a nationwide state of emergency over the coronavirus, gradually reopening the world's 
third-largest economy.
Meanwhile, China's plans to impose a new security law on Hong Kong will not erode freedoms, the city's leader 
said Tuesday, as she tried to reassure international businesses and investors alarmed by the proposal.
Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the controversial law would "only target a handful of lawbreakers" but she would 
not be drawn on what actions and opinions would be deemed illegal once the legislation is passed.
The euro was quoted at USD1.0918, up from USD1.0886 late Friday in London. Against the yen, the dollar was 
quoted at JPY107.84, firm from JPY107.51.
Oil was quoted at USD36.20 a barrel Tuesday morning, up sharply from USD34.72 late Friday. Gold was quoted at 
USD1,728.41 an ounce, soft from USD1,733.00.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC subsidiary Lauda is to close its base at Vienna's airport following a dispute 
with a trade union, the company said on Friday.
Some 300 jobs will be affected, the airline said. It had recently given the Vida union an ultimatum to sign a new 
collective agreement with significant wage cuts for employees due to the coronavirus crisis.
As the union refused, the base will be closed on May 29, the statement said.
"In a shameful way, the union Vida ignored the wishes of more than 95% of the pilots and 70% of the cabin crew at 
Lauda's A320 base in Vienna and destroyed more than 300 well-paid jobs," Lauda bosses Andreas Gruber and 
David O'Brien were quoted as saying.
Vida on the other hand described Ryanair and Austria's Economic Chamber as "gravediggers" of living wages. The 
chamber had spoken out in favour of signing the wage deal.
According to the airline, the new agreement would have given junior cabin crew an average annual income of 
EUR24,450, a captain would have earned about EUR117,000.
The Vienna base is by far the largest base of the Ryanair subsidiary, which currently has a fleet of 26 aircraft. The 
aircraft are grounded due to the virus pandemic.

(Alliance News) - International travellers could face spot checks and GBP1,000 fines if they fail to self-isolate for 14 
days after arriving in the UK under measures to guard against a second wave of coronavirus.
Home Secretary Priti Patel is expected to outline the plans – which will be introduced early next month – at the daily 
Downing Street briefing on Friday, a senior Government official confirmed.
Exemptions for road hauliers and medical officials will apply, while the common travel area with Ireland will be 
unaffected. Arrivals from France will not be exempt, the official confirmed, following confusion earlier this week.
Travellers will be asked to fill in a form with their contact information, and health officials will perform spot checks to 
ensure compliance with the measures.
The move will anger some sectors, with Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary earlier this week branding the plan "idiotic" 
and "unimplementable", while trade body Airlines UK has previously said a quarantine "would effectively kill" 
international travel to and from Britain.
Meanwhile, the scientific advice given to the government which informed proposals to send some pupils back to 
school from June 1 will be published.
The Sun newspaper reported that the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies papers will suggest teachers are 
at no greater risk of catching coronavirus than other key workers.
The publication of the advice follows concern from teaching unions and council leaders about the government's 
plans to allow children in nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to school from next month.

London Mayor Calls For Immediate 14-Day Quarantine On Foreign Visitors

(Alliance News) - UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been by urged by London Mayor Sadiq Khan to impose a 
14-day quarantine on international travellers arriving in the UK as soon as possible in response to fears of new 
arrivals seeding a second wave of Covid-19.
Khan said the UK was an international outlier because it had not imposed widespread quarantine arrangements – 
and suggested this was due to a lack of preparation for a pandemic.
UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the scheme would come into operation "early next month" and promised 
that details would be set out shortly.
He indicated that it would be a "blanket" provision applying to all countries, although ministers have already said the 
common travel area with Ireland would be unaffected.
Khan told the PA news agency: "We have got a number of airports that serve us – Heathrow, Gatwick, City, 
Stansted and a number of other peripheral ones – but also the Eurostar as well.
"I think it's really important that anybody coming to our country isolates for at least 14 days. I want them tested as 
well as soon as they possibly can."
Khan said London could not risk a second wave of Covid-19 being brought in from overseas.
"That's why it's really important for us to be properly looking at people who have come from elsewhere around the 
world, whether it's China, Italy, France, the Far East – anywhere," he said.
The Labour mayor suggested the government was having to "retrofit" policies around its own failure to prepare for 
the outbreak.
He said: "I'm not sure what the advantage is of waiting, except for us being able to ramp up facilities.
London Mayor Calls For Immediate 14-Day Quarantine On Foreign Visitors
"This is another example of us being an outlier as a country."
He said the situation was "not based on science, it's based on us having to retrofit our policies around a lack of 
preparedness in relation to testing equipment and having the contact tracing in place".
Shapps told MPs that the government could consider granting exemptions for passengers from countries with low 
infection rates, but only after the initial measures are introduced.
He said: "It is the case we should consider further improvements – for example, things like air bridges enabling 
people from other countries who have themselves achieved lower levels of coronavirus infection to come to the 
country.
"So, those are active discussions that go beyond what will initially be a blanket situation."
The plans for quarantine restrictions were condemned as "idiotic" and "unimplementable" by Ryanair Holdings PLC 
boss Michael O'Leary.
There was "no medical or scientific basis", or the measures and instead said face masks would "eliminate" the risk 
of spreading coronavirus.
Ryanair announced last week that it will operate nearly 1,000 flights per day from July 1 subject to European 
countries lifting flight restrictions and "effective public health measures" being put in place at airports.
O'Leary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "You don't have enough police in the UK to implement a two-week 
lockdown.
"And what's really worrying is that a two-week lockdown has no medical or scientific basis to it in any event.
"If you really want to do something that's effective – wear masks."
The prime minister's spokesman told a Westminster briefing on Monday afternoon that the quarantine would be 
reviewed every three weeks.
"Any changes brought in will be subject to a rolling review every three weeks to ensure they are in line with the 
latest scientific advice and that they remain effective and necessary," he said.
The spokesman added: "The PM has said that those arriving in the UK from overseas will be required to self-isolate 
in order to prevent infections from abroad and a second wave of cases.
"The work on this is continuing and we will set out more details in due course."

(Alliance News) -  The British Airline Pilots Association on Tuesday said that Ryanair Holdings PLC has proposed 
cutting 336 pilot jobs in the UK in addition to slashing salaries by 20%.
"Ryanair has also proposed 20% pay cuts and other reductions in terms and conditions saying it would dismiss and 
re-engage on the revised terms if agreement to the changes was not reached," the trade union said. 
BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said: "The hypocrisy of Ryanair taking GBP600 million in support from the 
British government which it previously said it did not want is hardly surprising and neither is their cavalier treatment 
of loyal staff. The company is sitting on EUR4.1 billion cash including this latest funding via the Bank of England, 
and its balance sheet is, in its own words, 'one of the strongest in the industry' yet it still wants to make 
redundancies and impose pay cuts." 
"Our question is what assurances did the UK government get from Ryanair about its workers before the Bank of 
England handed out the cash? Funding an airline whose own state isn’t offering a penny, when that airline goes on 
to treat its own staff like this, beggars belief," Strutton added.
Earlier in May, Ryanair said it could slash up to 3,000 jobs in response to destructive effects the Covid-19 pandemic 
has had on travel.
Ryanair stock closed 1.7% higher at EUR9.95 pence each on Tuesday in London.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened higher on Tuesday as hopes for a coronavirus vaccine gained 
traction, while Imperial Brands restricted gains in the FTSE 100 after slashing its dividend.
On Monday, US biotech firm Moderna reported "positive interim" results in early testing of a vaccine candidate, with 
some experts suggesting that if all goes well it could be in use by the end of the year.
The large-cap index was up 40.03 points, or 0.7%, at 6,088.62. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was up 198.31 points, 
or 1.3%, at 16,428.34. The AIM All-Share index was up 0.4% at 829.13.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 0.7% at 10,292.40. The Cboe 250 was up 0.9% at 13,890.25, and the Cboe Small 
Companies was up 0.1% at 8,750.68.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.8%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 1.1%.
In the FTSE 100, airlines rose to the top of the index, continuing positive momentum from Monday, with 
International Consolidated Airlines up 8.5% and easyJet up 4.5%, amid hopes a coronavirus vaccine is in sight. The 
two stocks closed up 11% and 10% respectively on Monday.
Elsewhere in the sector, Ryanair was up 4.8% and Wizz Air up 3.8%.
DCC was up 3.7% after the Irish support services firm raised its dividend despite the uncertainty created by the 
Covid-19 pandemic.
For the financial year ended March 31, revenue slipped 3.1% to GBP14.76 billion from GBP15.23 billion in financial 
2019 and pretax profit by 4.9% to GBP311.5 million from GBP327.4 million the year before. However, adjusted 
operating profit rose 7.3% to GBP494.3 million from GBP460.5 million.
The Dublin-based firm said it performed "robustly in April and the early weeks of May".

DCC said it will be affected by the coronavirus pandemic in the near-term, but also noted that it is well-positioned to 
continue growing in the future due to its business model, leading market position, and strong balance sheet.
At the other end of the large-cap index, Imperial Brands was the worst performer, down 5.5%. The Davidoff, West, 
Gauloises Blondes cigarettes maker slashed its dividend after reporting a drop in profit.
For the half-year ended March 31, revenue rose to GBP14.67 billion from GBP14.39 billion last year, but pretax 
profit fell 23% to GBP785 million from GBP1.02 billion. Operating profit fell 20% to GBP925 million. 
Imperial Brands cut its interim dividend by 33% to 41.70 pence from 62.56p last year. 
Looking ahead, Imperial expects coronavirus-related factors to have a low single-digit impact on earnings per share 
and warned of a bigger Covid-19 hit in the second half of financial 2021.
"By its own admission, it has been a disappointing time of late for Imperial and the renewed focus of concentrating 
on its strengths is possibly overdue. Its products give its stock a strong defensive quality, including the generous 
dividend yield, market share has been nudging higher in its main lines and margins remain strong given lower 
production costs, now entrenched after some years of focus," commented Interactive Investor's Richard Hunter.
Compass Group was down 3.0% after the contract caterer launched a GBP2.0 billion share placing, subscription 
and retail offer after reporting a double-digit profit decline in the first half of its current financial year. 
The Chertsey, England-headquartered company reported revenue of GBP12.5 billion for the six months to the end 
of March, up 1.2% from GBP12.3 billion reported a year earlier. Organic revenue increased by 1.6% in the first half.
For the five months to the end of February, organic revenue growth was around 6%, the company noted, before a 
20% fall in March and a 46% slump in April.
Compass said it recognises the importance of a dividend to its shareholders. However, it explained it needs to 
balance this with the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on its business. As a result, Compass decided not 
to declare an interim or a final dividend for the year to the end of September.
Looking ahead, Compass said the duration of the pandemic, and the pace at which containment measures are 
relaxed in different countries is unknown, making it a challenge to reliably assess the impact across markets the 
company operates in.
Therefore, Compass said it is withdrawing its previous growth and margin outlook for 2020. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.5%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 0.7%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is up 1.9%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2257 early Tuesday, higher than USD1.2221 at the London close Monday.
The UK unemployment rate edged lower in the three months to March, the Office for National Statistics said.
The unemployment rate in the UK decreased to 3.9% in three months to March, as the lockdown in the UK came 
into effect, down from the three months to 4.0% in February. Market consensus estimates had expected the latest 
jobless rate to rise to 4.4%.
Suggesting worse ahead, however, the number of people in the UK claiming jobless benefits jumped by 69% in 
April from March.
The euro was quoted at USD1.0941, up from USD1.0892 after France and Germany proposed Monday a EUR500 
billion fund to finance the recovery of the EU's economy from the devastation wrought by the coronavirus crisis.

Putting aside past differences and seeking to prove that the Franco-German core of Europe remains intact, 
President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the unprecedented package after talks by 
video conference.
Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY107.38, flat from JPY107.39.
Brent oil was quoted at USD35.38 a barrel Tuesday morning, marginally lower than USD35.48 late Monday. Gold 
was quoted at USD1,731.01 an ounce, firm from USD1,729.70.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a rise in earnings and traffic in its recently ended 
financial year which was largely unaffected by the Covid-19 pandemic that has since battered the airline sector. 
The Irish budget carrier yet again took aim at "state aid doping", reaffirmed its bleak traffic expectations for the 
second quarter of the new year, and said it expects a EUR200 million loss in the first quarter. 
Revenue in the financial year that ended March 31 was 10% higher annually at EUR8.49 billion from EUR7.70 
billion. Pretax profit, however, was down by 29% year-on-year to EUR670.3 million from EUR948.1 million. 
Weighing on Ryanair's profit was a EUR407.2 million charge for fuel hedge ineffectiveness. Without taking that 
accounting hit, pretax profit would have come in 14% higher at EUR1.08 billion. The bulk of the ineffectiveness 
costs were in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
"The widespread grounding of aircraft as a result of European Union governments reactions to the spread of Covid-
19 means that the group will operate a significantly reduced flying schedule in financial 2021 compared to what was 
originally expected. Therefore, the group is recording an exceptional hedge ineffectiveness charge of EUR392 
million, net of a tax credit, in relation to financial 2021 jet fuel hedges," Ryanair explained. 
Back to the recently ended financial year, Ryanair's total number of passengers climbed 3.8% to 148.6 million, 
though its load factor slipped slightly to 95% from 96%. 
The fuel bill was 14% higher at EUR2.8 billion, amid higher prices during the year and the rise in traffic. 
Ryanair added: "Financial 2021 will be difficult for the Ryanair Group as its airlines work hard to return to scheduled 
flying following the Covid-19 crisis. Unlike many flag carrier competitors, Ryanair will not request or receive state 
aid. 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Profit Hurt By Fuel Hedges As Braces For Virus Pain
"When group airlines return to scheduled flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be distorted by 
unprecedented quantums of state aid."
Ryanair noted Deutsche Lufthansa AG has taken EUR12.4 billion in aid, and recently renationalised Alitalia has 
received EUR3.5 billion in government assistance. With large war chests for these rivals, Ryanair said it expects 
below-cost selling in the year ahead.
Ryanair earlier in May said it could slash up to 3,000 jobs as the Irish budget airline embarks on a restructuring in 
response to destructive effects of Covid-19. 
The carrier also confirmed it expects to carry no more than 50% of its original traffic target of 44.6 million in its 
financial second quarter, from July to September. 
Ryanair expects to operate fewer than 1% of its scheduled flight programme in April, May and June - its first 
quarter. It expects a EUR200 million loss in the first quarter, with a reduced loss in the second. 
The company also added it is in talks with Boeing Co to cut planned aircraft deliveries, "to reflect slower traffic 
growth post Covid-19 in 2020 & 2021". 
"The group currently expects to carry less than 80 million passengers in financial 2021, almost 50% below its 
original 154 million target," Ryanair said. 
Monday's was the last annual report the carrier publishes with David Bonderman as chair;he steps down on June 1 
and will be replaced by Stan McCarthy, currently deputy chair. 
In London on Friday, Ryanair shares closed 1.7% lower at EUR8.45 each.

Extra trains are expected to take thousands more people back to work under the UK government's plan to 
accelerate economic activity by lifting lockdown restrictions, PA reported. After the first weekend in which people in 
England could enjoy sunbathing and picnics outdoors, public transport operators were preparing to carry many 
more commuters to building sites, factories and offices on Monday. The move comes at the start of the first full 
working week since Boris Johnson set out his plan for easing the coronavirus lockdown in England, urging those 
employees unable to work from home to return to their places of employment. The Times newspaper reported lorry 
drivers will make up the bulk of exemptions to plans to impose a 14-day quarantine on international travellers 
regardless of mode of travel. The paper said hauliers will account for around two-thirds of those who will not be 
asked to self-isolate in what it called a "blow to the airline and tourism industries". Further exemptions are to be 
agreed at a Cabinet meeting, the Times added.

Spain on Sunday reported 87 coronavirus deaths over a 24-hour period, the first time in two months that the daily 
toll has dropped below 100. The number came a day before Spain is to further relax lockdown measures across the 
country, except in Madrid and Barcelona. At the height of the current outbreak in early April, Spain counted 950 
deaths in one day. Spain remains one of the countries hardest hit by the virus with a total of 27,650 deaths, the 
health ministry reported on Sunday. The number of confirmed cases is more than 231,000.
----------
Italy also on Sunday recorded the fewest deaths from coronavirus in one day since its two-month lockdown began, 
as the country stands poised to reopen most commercial activity. The civil protection unit said 145 people had died 
of the virus in the last 24 hours, the lowest level since March 9, when 97 people died of Covid-19. On Monday, most 
of the country's businesses will emerge from a two-month quarantine imposed by the government on March 9.  
Restaurants, bars, cafes, hairdressers, and retail stores will be allowed to reopen. Gyms, pools, cinemas and 
theatres are allowed to open on May 25.

Gold miner Centamin said it delivered a strong financial performance in 2019 characterised by continued 
operational improvements at its flagship Sukari mine in Egypt. Centamin's revenue came in at USD658.1 million in 
the calendar year, up 7% from USD614.8 million in 2018, and pretax profit increased 13% to USD173.0 million from 
USD152.7 million. Gold production rose 2% to 480,528 ounces in 2019 from 472,418 ounces in 2018, but the 
amount of gold the company sold fell 3% to 470,020 ounces from 484,322 ounces. Looking ahead, Centamin 
maintained its production guidance of between 510,000 to 540,000 ounces of gold in 2020.

Hochschild Mining said it has met all the Covid-19 health and safety protocols established by the Peruvian 
government to restart operations at the Inmaculada and Pallancata mines. The gold miner plans to begin ramping-
up progressively to achieve full production in the coming weeks. Hochschild expects to reissue its annual guidance

light from lawyers and funders to start legal action in the next few days. It will be run by law firm Mishcon de Reya 
and financed by litigation funder Harbour. Hiscox and other insurers said that, in most cases, business interruption 
policies do not cover costs related to the pandemic.

Boeing on Sunday said the X-37B autonomous spaceplane has been launched on top of a United Launch Alliance 
Atlas V rocket. Built by Boeing, the X-37B's latest mission was its second for the US Space Force and its sixth 
overall. This most recent mission will see the spaceplane deploy FalconSAT-8, a small US Air Force Academy-
developed satellite which is sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory and will conduct experiments on orbit. 
The mission will also test technologies for reusable space vehicles. First launched in April 2010, the X-37B was 
originally designed for 270-day missions but has since spent far longer, including spending 780 days in orbit before 
returning to earth in October 2019.

Fresnillo, up 11%, Polymetal International, up 4.5%. The gold miners were tracking spot gold prices higher, quoted 
at USD1,761.45 an ounce Monday morning, up from USD1,743.84 late Friday. Gold hit an intraday high of 
USD1,764.48 an ounce overnight - the highest level since November 2012 - in the wake of comments from Federal 
Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The US central bank chief told broadcaster CBS's '60 Minutes' programme on 
Sunday that the US economy can begin to recover from a recession in the second half of the year, assuming the 
coronavirus doesn't erupt in a second wave. But Powell suggested that a full recovery won't likely be possible 
before the arrival of a vaccine.

Hochschild Mining, up 18%. The gold miner said that it has met all the health and safety requirements of the 
Peruvian government to restart operations at the Inmaculada and Pallancata mines. Hochschild expects to reissue 
its 2020 guidance once full production is achieved and the overall impact of mine suspensions is clear. In line with 
current government guidelines, the company's brownfield exploration programme is expected to recommence in 
July. In February, the company had said that it was targeting 422,000 gold equivalent production for 2020. 
However, this guidance was subsequently suspended in April due to the suspension of the company's mines in

Mitchells & Butlers, up 6.0%. The pub and restaurant operator said it has secured an extension to a temporary 
waiver granted against possible technical default on the company's loan covenants due to government-enforced 
closure of its restaurants and pubs. The waiver to the banking covenants has been extended to June 8. The FTSE 
250-listed pub company - which operates the Harvester, Toby Carvery, All Bar One and Miller & Carter chains - 
initially secured a waiver from its lenders in April to prevent a breach of its financing arrangements.

Ryanair Holdings, up 10%. The Irish carrier reported a rise in earnings and traffic in its recently ended financial year 
which was largely unaffected by the Covid-19 pandemic that has since battered the airline sector. Revenue in the 
financial year that ended March 31 was 10% higher annually at EUR8.49 billion from EUR7.70 billion. Pretax profit, 
however, was down by 29% year-on-year to EUR670.3 million from EUR948.1 million. Ryanair's total number of 
passengers climbed 3.8% to 148.6 million, though its load factor slipped slightly to 95% from 96%. Ryanair earlier in 
May said it could slash up to 3,000 jobs as the airline embarks on restructuring in response to destructive effects of 
Covid-19. "Ryanair's done a good job reigning in its cash expenses during the lockdown, but EUR60 million a week 
is still a lot. When furlough schemes start winding down costs may balloon again, but the group's formidable cash 
pile and relatively strong balance sheet gives it time to restructure," said Hargreaves Lansdown's Will Ryder. Blue-
chip peers International Consolidated Airlines and easyJet were up 8.3% and 7.2% respectively in a positive read-
across.

Collagen Solutions, up 16%. The biomaterials and regenerative medicines maker said that it is evaluating three 
different types of potential transactions, received as part of the company's formal sale process. In April, the 
company decided to conduct a formal review of various strategic options to maximise value for shareholders. These 
options included, but were not limited to, the potential sale of the entire company or the sale of one or more of the 
company's assets. Collagen, as part of the process, has received indications of interest in respect of a purchase of 
the entire company as a whole, a purchase or investment in a part of the business of the company and a 
refinancing of the company. Collagen said it is engaging with relevant parties "in a constructive and positive manner 
with a view to optimising value for shareholders".

Europe ease and death tolls from the coronavirus pandemic gradually decline.
Spain is set to further ease its lockdown measures. The country recorded 87 new virus-related deaths – the first 
time the daily number has fallen below 100 in two months. The UK also registered its lowest daily increase since 
late March, with 170 fatalities.
On Sunday, the US also recorded its lowest daily death toll in a week, at 820, but the country with the world's

(Alliance News) - Baillie Gifford European Growth Trust PLC on Monday reported a drop in net assets over the first 
half but is confident in its new investment manager's ability to perform amid the coronavirus pandemic.
At March 31, Baillie Gifford European's NAV per share stood at 817.7 pence, down 12% compared to 929.0p at 
September 30.
Over the six months, the trust's net assets dropped 21% to GBP296.2 million from GBP373.9 million. The trust 
ended the first half with 36.2 million shares in issue from 40.2 million at the start of the period.
Baillie Gifford European does not pay interim dividends.
In the first half, the trust's NAV total return was negative 10% but was able to outperform its benchmark - the FTSE 
Europe ex UK, in sterling, index - which lost 17% in the same period.
The trust noted it changed investment manager in the period, moving to Baillie Gifford from Edinburgh Partners.
"Following the move to Baillie Gifford, the portfolio was reorganised extensively in the first half of December, with 
only one holding, Ryanair [Holdings PLC], being retained and 40 new ones bought. This was necessary to 
reposition the portfolio to growth equities," Chair Michael MacPhee said.
New manager Baillie Gifford said: "Holdings in the portfolio that performed well over the period included online food 
delivery service company Delivery Hero [SE], which made an attractive acquisition in South Korea; lab equipment 
provider Sartorius Stedim; and IT provider Bechtle. These companies have held up well during the crisis but, more 
importantly, benefit from structural growth that should endure long after the crisis has abated. 
"Low-cost airline Ryanair, rubber compounder Hexpol, and oil and gas pipe manufacturer Tenaris [SA] were 
noticeably weak although this was unsurprising given the impact of Covid-19 on their respective industries and also 
Baillie Gifford European Growth Assets Drop But Outperforms Benchmark
the consequent oil price shock, particularly for Tenaris. Importantly though, each of these companies is well 
capitalised and stands to benefit from consolidation and market share gains from weaker competitors."
Baillie Gifford noted, however, it was a "very short period" to judge its performance.
"We do not know how or when the current crisis is going to end. What we do know is that, if we continue to find 
exceptional businesses run by people whom we trust, the impact from this most unfortunate crisis will be relatively 
insignificant in the context of longer-term returns," the manager added.
Shares in Baillie Gifford European Growth Trust were 1.8% higher in London on Monday at 875.50 pence each.

fourth largest supplier of gas and power in Spain, with residential market shares of 12% and 6%, respectively. 
There will be no acquisition of assets in Ghana, however, the oil firm said. Back in May 2019, Total agreed a deal

6% to 10% will be alive five years after diagnosis. "Today's news is very welcome as we continue to evaluate the 
potential of Enhertu to help patients with this devastating type of lung cancer," said Jose Baselga, executive vice 
president Of Astra's Oncology Research & Development division.

GlaxoSmithKline said an interim analysis of a study has found ViiV Healthcare's injectable formulation of 
cabotegravir to be more effective than current standard care in prevention of HIV. ViiV Healthcare is a HIV company 
majority-owned by Glaxo, with Pfizer and Shionogi as shareholders. Glaxo said interim analysis of the HIV 
Prevention Trials Network 083 study found Cabotegravir to be 69% more effective in preventing HIV acquisition in 
men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men when compared to the current 
standard of care, daily oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 200 milligrams and 300 mg tablets. The study 
achieved its primary objective of non-inferiority with the difference approaching superiority in favour of Cabotegravir, 
pending final analysis, the London-based pharmaceutical company said.

The US is facing a severe economic downturn amid the global pandemic, but will not suffer another Great 
Depression and will see a recovery begin later this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The world's top 
economy was strong before the Covid-19 outbreak hit, like a natural disaster, causing nationwide business 
shutdowns, Powell said. And the banking system had been rebuilt stronger since the global financial crisis. Data 
show more than 30 million jobs were destroyed in the US, as businesses were shuttered nationwide amid the 
efforts to stop the spread of the virus. For the April-June period, the economic data "will be very, very bad. There'll 
be a big decline in economic activity, big increase in unemployment," Powell told the CBS programme "60 Minutes." 
The US economy could "easily" collapse by 20% to 30% this quarter, and unemployment could peak at 20 to 25%, 
but, "it should be a much shorter downturn than you would associate with the 1930s. "I think there's a good chance 
that there'll be positive growth in the third quarter," he said.
----------
The Japanese economy has plunged into recession as the coronavirus pandemic and a consumption tax hike from 
last year ravaged the world's third-largest economy. Japan's gross domestic product contracted at an annualized 
rate of 3.4% in the first quarter of 2020, according to a report released by the Cabinet Office. Economic growth in 
the last quarter of 2019 was revised down to a 7.3% contraction from a 7.1% fall estimated in March, the office said. 
The reading marks the biggest contraction in more than five years and comes after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's 
government raised the consumption tax from 8% to 10% on October 1. Two straight quarters of negative growth 
means that Japan has entered a recession amid the coronavirus crisis, as was widely expected.
----------
Extra trains are expected to take thousands more people back to work under the UK government's plan to 
accelerate economic activity by lifting lockdown restrictions, PA reported. After the first weekend in which people in 
England could enjoy sunbathing and picnics outdoors, public transport operators were preparing to carry many 
more commuters to building sites, factories and offices on Monday. The move comes at the start of the first full 
working week since Boris Johnson set out his plan for easing the coronavirus lockdown in England, urging those 
employees unable to work from home to return to their places of employment. The Times newspaper reported lorry 
drivers will make up the bulk of exemptions to plans to impose a 14-day quarantine on international travellers 
regardless of mode of travel.
----------
Spain on Sunday reported 87 coronavirus deaths over a 24-hour period, the first time in two months that the daily 
toll has dropped below 100. The number came a day before Spain is to further relax lockdown measures across the 
country, except in Madrid and Barcelona. At the height of the current outbreak in early April, Spain counted 950 
deaths in one day. Spain remains one of the countries hardest hit by the virus with a total of 27,650 deaths, the 
health ministry reported on Sunday. The number of confirmed cases is more than 231,000.
----------
Italy also on Sunday recorded the fewest deaths from coronavirus in one day since its two-month lockdown began, 
as the country stands poised to reopen most commercial activity. The civil protection unit said 145 people had died 
of the virus in the last 24 hours, the lowest level since March 9, when 97 people died of Covid-19. On Monday, most 
of the country's businesses will emerge from a two-month quarantine imposed by the government on March 9. 
Restaurants, bars, cafes, hairdressers, and retail stores will be allowed to reopen. Gyms, pools, cinemas and 
theatres are allowed to open on May 25.

The World Health Organization will kick off its first-ever virtual assembly, but fears abound that US-China tensions 
could derail the strong action needed to address the Covid-19 crisis. The World Health Assembly, which has been

trimmed from the usual three weeks to just two days, Monday and Tuesday, is expected to focus almost solely on 
Covid-19, which in a matter of months has killed more than 310,000 globally. A number of heads of state, 
government chiefs, health ministers and other dignitaries are expected to attend the meeting, which is due to kick 
off around noon. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday the event would be "one of the most 
important WHAs since we were founded in 1948". But the chance of reaching an agreement on global measures to 
address the crisis could be threatened by steadily deteriorating relations between the world's two largest economies 
over the pandemic.

(Alliance News) - Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the prospect of non-essential air travel from Ireland is months, 
rather than weeks, away.
Everyone who arrives in the wtate to stay, whether Irish or from abroad, is being asked to self-isolate for 14 days to 
ensure that anyone with Covid-19 does not infect others.
It comes amid calls for tougher laws to require people arriving into the country to tell authorities where they will be 
self-isolating.
Varadkar said: "The very strong advice from government is that anyone entering our country, whether they are an 
Irish citizen or not, needs to quarantine and self-isolate for 14 days with the exception of certain key workers.
"We are going to strengthen that over the next few weeks."
He was speaking at a visit to a contact-tracing centre in Dublin on Wednesday.
"Of course we all look forward to air travel in the future," he added.
"We're an island nation and a globalised economy. We need to return to business and leisure travel at some point, 
but that really is premature at this stage.
"The EU and the aviation authorities are thinking about that and how we can return to safe air travel, but that is 
months rather than weeks away."
The coronavirus death toll in Ireland rose to 1,497 on Wednesday after a further 10 deaths were announced.
There were 159 new confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total in Ireland since the outbreak began to 23,401.
On Tuesday, Ryanair Holdings PLC announced it was restoring 40% of its flight schedule from the start of July.
Ireland Leader Says Prospect Of Air Travel Months Not Weeks Away
However, Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan has urged Irish people not to start planning foreign summer 
holidays, predicting that the restrictions on non-essential air travel will still be in place until at least July.
The first phase of Ireland's five step lockdown exit plan is due to commence on Monday.
Varadkar said he is more confident that the country can begin to reopen from next week.
The National Public Health Emergency Team will make a recommendation to government later this week.
Outdoor construction work, DIY shops and small outside gatherings will be allowed from Monday if the government 
gives the go-ahead on the basis of the advice from the NPHET.
"It is fair to say that everything is going in the right direction, but a decision has yet to be made about whether we 
will get to ease restrictions on Monday," said Varadkar.
"As we ease restrictions, personal responsibility and personal discipline is going to be all the more important 
because we will be meeting each other more and more people will be going to work."
He said the government will issue guidance in the next few days about making and wearing face coverings to 
prevent the spread of Covid-19.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Transport Shane Ross said his department will provide funding to public transport 
companies to ensure their services can continue.
Ross, who lost his seat in the general election, returned to the Dail for the first time after he was cocooning at 
home. He continues as a minister until a new government is formed.
He told the Dail: "The public transport system is a critical part of the plan for reopening of the economy.
"It is inconceivable that public transport should not function properly in the present crisis.
"Therefore, I can confirm to the house that the government will provide the necessary additional funding to continue 
those services, despite the drop in fare income.
"My department is working closely with the National Transport Authority and Department of Public Expenditure and 
Reform of Ireland to assess and quantify this additional funding requirement."
He also said that it is "very likely" commuters will be asked to wear face masks when using public transport.
Holohan has said there is no plan to make the wearing of face masks compulsory.
Senior government official Liz Canavan said work is ongoing at government level on the use of face coverings in 
public.
Speaking at the Covid-19 briefing on Wednesday morning, she said: "We are aware of questions around the 
potential use of face masks or coverings as we move to lift restrictions.
"Work is ongoing around guidance and practical communication about the face coverings and how they can be 
made at home. A key message will be how to safely use face coverings because the evidence is clear. If face 
masks are not used properly then they can have the effect of increasing the risk of transmission.
"We will have more information for the public about face coverings in the coming days."
Ahead of some of the restrictions possibly being lifted next week, Canavan warned the public to remain vigilant.
Canavan said the government does not want to have to reintroduce measures in future, as some other countries 
have had to do due to a spike in coronavirus infections.
Ireland Leader Says Prospect Of Air Travel Months Not Weeks Away
She said: "Any lifting of restrictions carries a risk of going backwards and losing the hard-won progress of recent 
months. This week, we have seen some countries reinstate some restrictions.
"We do not want to have to do that. We are approaching our reopening in a gradual way.
"Therefore, it is important that we are disciplined in sticking to the guidelines that apply.
"It is also important to remember that we have not started to ease restrictions yet.
"Every day counts in terms of assessing where we are and how we can move on."

(Alliance News) - Aurora Investment Trust PLC on Thursday said it outperformed against its benchmark in 2019, as 
it highlighted the performance of its shares amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Shares in the investment trust closed 8.7% lower at 136.06 pence each on Thursday in London.
For 2019, Aurora's net asset value return was 30%  compared to the 19% return from FTSE All-Share index.
Net asset value per share as at December 31 was 232.07p, up from 182.24p the same date the year before, while 
the share price at the end of 2018 was 237.00p, reflecting a 2.1% premium to net asset value.
Aurora Investment declared an interim dividend of 4.5p per share, up from 4.0p the year before.
In 2019, Aurora, added Ryanair to its portfolio, and exited its holdings in supermarkets Tesco PLC and Wm 
Morrison Supermarkets PLC. Sports equipment and clothing retailer Frasers Group ended the year as the best 
performing holding in the portfolio posting a rise of 93%.
Looking ahead, the trust said that while it expects budget airline easyJet PLC, Ryanair Holdings PLC, JD 
Wetherspoon PLC and Frasers  to "suffer big losses" due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it will use the drop in share 
prices to invest the cash in the portfolio with the aim of adding future value.
Turning to its own share performance amid the pandemic, Chair Howard Flight said: "The board is pleased to note 
that, despite the extreme volatility in the stock markets, the company's ordinary shares have generally continued to 
trade at a premium to NAV and there remains market demand, allowing for further share issuance".
Aurora said it plans to issue a further 20% of shares. In 2019, 11.1 million shares were issued. The company 
currently has a market capitalisation of GBP99.6 million, down from GBP157.6 million at the end of 2019.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it plans to run 40% of its schedule from July, should 
government measures allow, as the budget carrier unveiled social distancing and precautionary measures for when 
flights resume.
Ryanair said it aims to operate a daily schedule of about 1,000 flights, and hopes to restore 90% of its pre-
pandemic route network. 
"Since the Covid-19 flight restrictions in mid-March, Ryanair has been operating a skeleton daily schedule of 30 
flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe. From July, Ryanair will restart flying from most of its 80 bases across 
Europe," Ryanair said. 
"There will be fewer daily/weekly frequencies on trunk routes, as Ryanair works to restore some services on the 
widest number of routes, rather than operating high frequency services on a small number."
All cabin crew will wear face masks, and in-flight services will be limited to just pre-packaged snacks and drinks with 
just cashless payments only. 
Passengers also will have to wear face masks and undergo temperature checks at the airport. What's more, there 
will be no queues for on-board lavatories, with passengers being made to ask cabin crew if they can use the toilet. 
"As a temporary further public health measure, while European Union states emerge from their respective Covid-19 
lockdowns, Ryanair will require all passengers flying in July & August to fill in details (at the point of check in) of 
how long their planned visit will be, and also their address while visiting another EU country, and this contact 
information will be provided to EU governments to help them to monitor any isolation regulations they require of 
visitors on intra-EU flights," Ryanair added. 
It's been tough time for airlines globally, as lockdowns and international travel restrictions have emptied skies.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair To Restore 40% Of Flights In July With Health Steps
Dublin-based Ryanair earlier in May warned 3,000 jobs could go, as it embarks on a restructuring in response to 
destructive effects the pandemic has had on travel. 
"With more than six weeks to go to July 1, Ryanair believes this is the most practical date to resume normal flight 
schedules, so that we can allow friends and families to reunite, commuters to go back to work, and allow those 
tourism based economies such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, France and others, to recover what is left of this 
year's tourism season," Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wilson said. 
Ryanair shares were 3.3% higher at EUR9.16 each in London on Tuesday morning.

(Alliance News) - Heathrow Airport Holdings Ltd on Monday reported April traffic figures, demonstrating just how 
badly the travel restrictions to fight the Covid-19 pandemic has hurt the industry. 
The airport owner also called on the UK government to lay out plans for reopening borders. Going in the opposite 
direction, the prime minister on Sunday announced plans for a 14-day quarantine for new UK arrivals, heaping 
further pressure on an already fragile aviation sector.
Heathrow Airport, usually one of Europe's busiest, reported a 97% fall in April traffic to just 200,000 passengers, the 
sort of numbers it would normally see in just one day. 
During the month, 1,788 cargo only flights were operated, delivering crucial supplies of personal protective 
equipment, Heathrow noted. 
"The airport supports government's aim of avoiding a second wave of infection, even though the 14-day quarantine 
plan will effectively close borders temporarily. It is likely that few passenger flights will operate and even less people 
will travel until the quarantine is lifted," Heathrow said. 
Though the airport added: "Heathrow calls on government to lay out a road map for how borders can eventually be 
reopened and to take a lead in developing a common international standard so that passengers can travel freely 
between low risk countries once the infection rate has been brought down."
The travel sector has been battered by lockdowns implemented globally as governments grappled to halt the 
spread of Covid-19.
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, owner of British Airways, on Thursday reported a quarterly operating 
loss of EUR1.86 billion. IAG has also warned of 12,000 job losses at the British carrier.

Also warning of redundancies were Ryanair Holdings PLC and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd, both saying that 3,000 
jobs could be slashed. The latter also said it will move its operations from London Gatwick airport to Heathrow, as 
part of measures to "reshape and resize" the business.
Carriers were lower on the London Stock Exchange on Monday morning. easyJet PLC lost 7.0% to 494.40 pence, 
IAG was 4.1% lower at 182.65p, while Ryanair was 2.7% lower at EUR9.01.

(Alliance News) - Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Tuesday posted dismal 
trading performances for April as a result of air travel restrictions imposed by governments across Europe to contain 
the spread of the new coronavirus.
Airlines around the globe have furloughed or shed thousands of staff in a bid to stay afloat, as the majority of the 
world's air travel remains restricted.
Ryanair on Tuesday reported a 99.6% drop in April traffic to just about 40,000 passengers from 13.5 million in April 
2019 due to flight bans and travel restrictions.
The core Ryanair branded airline carried all the 40,000 passengers in the month, while Lauda in Austria flew none 
at all.
The Irish company said it operated just 600 scheduled flights in April and expects to carry minimal traffic during the 
months of May and June as well.
At the start of May, Ryanair had warned that it could slash up to 3,000 jobs, implement a 20% pay cut and close 
several European bases in response to the destructive effects of Covid-19 on travel.
Eastern European-focused Wizz Air separately reported a 98% fall in April passenger numbers to 78,389 from 3.3 
million in April 2019.
More positively, Wizz Air announced five new destinations to Abu Dhabi, with the first flights from Budapest and 
Bucharest commencing in June 2020, and three additional destinations starting in September. The launch of the 
company's new low-cost airline Wizz Air Abu Dhabi is progressing in line with the initial timeline, it said.

operations and offer refunds to customers. It also had to raise around GBP6.5 billion in April to bolster its liquidity 
position. "Any resumption of cruise operations - whenever that may be - is fully dependent on our continued efforts 
in cooperation with federal, state, local and international government officials. In our continued support of public 
health efforts, any return to service will also include whatever enhanced operational protocols and social gathering

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Services Sector Activity Slumps In April
The UK service sector slumped to unseen levels in April due to Covid-19 lockdowns, data confirmed, though 
conditions were marginally better than first expected. IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply 
services purchasing managers' index fell to 13.4 in April from 34.5 in March. The earlier flash reading for April was 
12.3. Prior to the onset of Covid-19, the survey's record low had been at 40.1 in November 2008. Any reading 
below 50 indicates contraction. Nearly 80% of survey respondents reported a drop in business activity in April, 
almost double the record set in March of 43%. Reduced activity volumes were overwhelmingly attributed to 
business closures, shutdowns among clients, or falling sales due to a drop in non-essential spending. Around half 
of those surveyed indicated a decline in payroll numbers during April.
----------
New car sales in Britain crashed in April to hit the lowest level since 1946, mirroring falls across Europe, with many 
showrooms shut for the coronavirus lockdown, industry data showed. New registrations for all cars collapsed by a 
"precipitous" 97% last month on a yearly basis to just 4,321 vehicles, the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders 
said in a statement. That was the worst performance since February 1946 and compared with 161,000 cars in the 
same month of 2019. SMMT said car showrooms were closed for Britain's lockdown – which was implemented 
nationwide on March 23 – but some deliveries did take place for key workers and front-line public services and 
companies. The industry group forecast that around 1.68 million new cars will be registered in 2020, which would 
mark a 27% slump from last year.
----------
The UK and the US are to begin negotiations on an "ambitious" post-Brexit free trade agreement. International 
Trade Secretary Liz Truss and the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer will open the talks with a video 
conference call on Tuesday. The first round of negotiations will then continue for around two weeks, with around 
100 negotiators on each side taking part. Further rounds will take place every six weeks with talks being conducted 
remotely until it is safe to travel again. At official level the talks will be led by Oliver Griffiths at the Department for 
International Trade for the UK and Daniel Mullaney, the assistant US trade representative for Europe and the 
Middle East.

Germany's Constitutional Court largely upheld several complaints against the European Central Bank's purchase of 
government bonds under a programme designed to boost the economy and inflation since 2015. This was the result 
of years of debate over the role of the eurozone central bank, with judges announcing their ruling in the city of 
Karlsruhe on Tuesday, dpa reported. It does not cover current ECB aid issued in response to the coronavirus crisis. 
Top German judges raised concerns back in 2017 that one part of the bond-buying programme, the Public Sector 
Purchase Programme, could engage in economic policy and government financing, both of which the ECB is 
prohibited from doing. The programme was used to buy government bonds and other securities worth 
approximately EUR2.6 trillion between March 2015 and the end of 2018 with the aim of boosting the economy. The 
court ruled the ECB must clarify a key bond-buying scheme to support the eurozone economy is "proportionate" or 
else Germany's central bank may no longer participate, AFP reported.

The global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic topped a quarter of a million, with the US government 
predicting a further surge in fatalities as an international vaccine drive garnered USD8 billion in pledges. The dire 
forecast from the US came as much of the Western world emerged from weeks of lockdown, with hopes that the 
disease may have peaked in Europe, where deaths in the worst affected countries have dropped after nearly two 
months of confinement. But the global progress did little to cool a war of words between the US and China over 
responsibility for the pandemic – a feud that has been fuelled by US claims the virus originated in a Chinese 
laboratory – a theory the World Health Organization labelled "speculative". An AFP tally of official figures showed 
Europe is the hardest-hit continent with around 145,000 fatalities. The US has recorded close to 68,700. Together 
they account for more than 85% of global deaths.

(Alliance News) - Virgin Atlantic on Tuesday said it will axe over 3,000 jobs and move its operations from London's 
Gatwick airport to Heathrow, as part of measures to "reshape and resize" the business amid the severe impact of 
the Covid-19 pandemic on the travel and aviation industry.
The airline, which is majority owned by British businessman Richard Branson's Virgin Group, also plans to retire all 
of its seven Boeing 747-400 aircraft, with four Airbus A330-200  aircraft retiring in early 2022 as planned.
The Crawley, England-based company said it continues to explore all available options to obtain additional external 
funding and remains in "constructive" talks with several stakeholders including the UK government.
Airlines around the globe have furloughed or shed thousands of staff in a bid to stay afloat, as the majority of the 
world's air travel remains restricted. 
International Consolidated Airlines SA-owned British Airways has begun consultation on up to 12,000 
redundancies, while Ryanair Holdings PLC has decided to cut 3,000 jobs.
"In order for the airline to emerge from the crisis, regrettably it must reduce the number of people employed and 
today the company is announcing a planned reduction of 3,150 jobs across all functions. Working closely with 
unions BALPA and Unite, a company-wide consultation period of 45 days begins today," Virgin Atlantic said.
"As Virgin Atlantic aims to establish itself as the sustainability leader, it will fly only wide-body, twin-engine aircraft 
from London Heathrow and Manchester to the most popular destinations. It will be moving its flying programme 
from London Gatwick to London Heathrow, with the intention of retaining its slot portfolio at London Gatwick, so it 
can return in line with customer demand," it added.
Virgin Atlantic Chief Executive Shai Weiss said: "We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years 
ago, but none has been as devastating as Covid-19 and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many.

"It is crucial that we return to profitability in 2021. This will mean taking steps to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic in 
line with demand, while always keeping our people and customers at the heart of all we do".
The British Airline Pilots Association termed the Virgin Atlantic job cuts as "devastating" and said that without UK 
government support the aviation industry will be "decimated".
BALPA estimated 426 pilots at Virgin Atlantic were at risk of losing jobs and asked the UK government to "call a 
moratorium on job losses in aviation and lead a planned recovery".

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair said Friday it expects a significant decline in air traffic in 2020, while 
complaining about the "distorted" playing field as it charged that legacy European airlines have received over 
EUR30 billion in state aid.
Ryanair said this is a "clear breach" of both EU competition and state aid rules.
"This unlawful and discriminatory state aid will be challenged by Ryanair in the European Courts," the airline added. 
"When Ryanair returns to meaningful flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be distorted by 
unprecedented volumes of state aid from some EU governments to their 'national' airlines."
It said: "As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at 
least July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand 
and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least 2 years, until summer 2022 at the earliest."
Ryanair said it will begin restructuring, starting in July, which could see the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin 
crew jobs, unpaid leave, and pay cuts of up to 20%, as well as the closure of a number of aircraft bases across 
Europe until traffic recovers.
Due to continent-wide EU government flight restrictions, Ryanair expects to operate less than 1% of its scheduled 
flying program in April, May and June.
First-quarter traffic is expected to be down 96% year on year at 150,000 passengers.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to deliver a "comprehensive plan" next week on how the lockdown 
may be eased after declaring the UK is "past the peak" of the coronavirus outbreak. Johnson said on Thursday he 
would be producing a "road map, a menu of options" explaining how to get the economy moving and children back 
to school while still suppressing the disease's spread. Testing is a key part of the strategy in any effort to ease 
restrictions, and the public may find out on Friday if the government reached its target of carrying out 100,000-a-day 
by the end of Thursday. Johnson made his commitment as he fronted his first Downing Street press conference 
since leaving hospital for Covid-19, and he praised the NHS saying he had been "very, very lucky" but "thousands 
LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair To Cut 3,000 Jobs As Bemoans Unfair State Aid
of people have been less fortunate than I was". With the death toll having exceeded 26,700 and under pressure to 
detail a blueprint for easing the lockdown, the PM said: "We are past the peak and on the downward slope."

UK house prices were gaining momentum before Covid-19 crippled the country, Nationwide said. Annual house 
price growth was 3.7% in April, with prices up 0.7% month-on-month. In March, prices had risen 3.0% annually and 
0.8% on a monthly basis. "It's important to note that the impact of the pandemic is not fully captured in this month's 
figures. This is because our index is constructed using mortgage approval data, and there is a lag between 
mortgage applications being submitted and approved," Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, highlighted.

Britain's manufacturers have suffered a "collapse" in demand because of the impact of the global lockdown amid 
warnings that conditions are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal for some time, a new survey suggests. 
Research among almost 300 firms by manufacturers' organisation Make UK showed three out of four had seen 
sales fall. One in five said orders had slumped by more than 50% and a similar number had furloughed workers. 
Make UK warned the extent of the fall is likely to mean the recent Office for Budget Responsibility forecast of a 55% 
reduction in manufacturing output in the second quarter of the year is likely to be an underestimate.

Ireland suffered a record fall in manufacturing output and orders in April, the AIB purchasing managers' index 
showed. The PMI slumped to 36.0 in April from 45.1 in March, the worst reading since 2009. Any reading over 50 
indicates expansion in the sector and one below contraction. Output, new orders, exports and purchasing in Ireland 
all fell at the fastest rates in the 22-year survey history. Jobs were shed at the joint-fastest rate on record, matching 
the pace seen in February 2009. Data signalled "collapsing demand" from both domestic and international markets, 
with new export orders contracting at a record pace.

Japan's manufacturing sector saw its downturn intensify in April with production falling at the sharpest rate since 
2009, IHS Markit data showed. The headline au Jibun Bank purchasing managers' index dropped to an eleven-year

rate for over eleven years amid reports of order cancellations. Overseas demand dropped and new export orders 
fell at a rate not seen since the height of the financial crisis.

RBS followed UK banking peers in reporting a sharp drop in profit due to a significant rise in credit impairments. 
Operating pretax profit dropped to GBP519 million in the first quarter from GBP1.01 billion a year before. The lender 
upped its impairment losses to GBP802 million for the period from just GBP86 million a year before. Net interest 
income was down to GBP1.94 billion from GBP2.03 billion, as the lender's net interest margin worsened to 1.89% 
from 2.07%. This was partly offset by its customer loan book rising to GBP351.3 billion from GBP306.4 billion.

workforce that has been furloughed will be able to return to work in May - but is not opening its sales centres or 
show homes. "Since our sales centres closed, we have continued to see customer interest, albeit at reduced levels 
compared to the period to March 22, 2020. As expected, since closing our sales centres, we have experienced a 
low level of reservations. We expect reservations to continue at low levels until our sales centres and show homes 
reopen," Barratt said. At April 26, Barratt has completed 11,776 homes - versus 11,723 the year before. Total 
forward sales stand at 12,271 with a value of GBP2.85 billion. Barratt said it continues to be financially strong, with 
about GBP430 million of cash at April 28.

US pharmaceutical firm Gilead Sciences on Thursday said first quarter profit fell as it incurred costs ramping up 
remdesivir, a drug being trialled as a possible Covid-19 treatment. Total revenue for the first three months of the 
year rose 5% to USD5.55 billion from USD5.28 billion a year ago, with product sales up 5.1% to USD5.47 billion 
from USD5.20 billion. Product sales benefited from around USD200 million in revenue related to increased 
customer buying patterns and patient prescription trends, primarily in the US, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
However, attributable net income fell 21% to USD1.55 billion from USD1.98 billion, and earnings per share slipped 
to USD1.22 from USD1.54. "The total investments in remdesivir, primarily to expand manufacturing production, 
throughout 2020 could be material, but the amount, timing and accounting for the investments as well as the 
potential to recoup Gilead's at-risk investments at some point in the future are dependent on clinical trial and 
regulatory outcomes. Where authorized by regulatory authorities, Gilead will focus on making remdesivir both 
accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world," it said.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said it could slash up to 3,000 jobs as the Irish budget airline 
embarks on a restructuring in response to destructive effects the Covid-19 has had pandemic on travel. 
Ryanair also took aim at what it labelled as "state-aid doping", to which the likes of airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG 
and Anglo-German holiday operator TUI Group AG have turned in the face of the ongoing health crisis. 
"As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least 
July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and 
pricing to 2019 levels will take at least 2 years, until summer 2022 at the earliest," Ryanair explained. 
"The Ryanair airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss programme."
It may result in 3,000 job losses, mainly with pilots and cabin crew, but also pay cuts as high as 20% and the 
closure of a number of bases across Europe. The latter measure will be in place until traffic recovers, Ryanair 
noted. 
"Job cuts and pay cuts will also be extended to head office and back office teams. Group Chief Executive Officer 
Michael O'Leary, whose pay was cut by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend this 50% pay cut for the 
remainder of the financial year to March 2021," Ryanair said. 
The British Airline Pilots Association on Friday morning issued its response to the planned cuts. 
BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said: "There has been no warning or consultation by Ryanair about the 
3,000 potential job losses and this is miserable news for pilots and staff who have taken pay cuts under the 
government job retention scheme. Ryanair seems to have done a u-turn on its ability to weather the Covid storm.

"Aviation workers are now facing a tsunami of job losses. The UK government has to stop daydreaming and keep to 
the promise made by the chancellor on March 17 to help airlines or this industry, vital to the U.K. economy, will be 
devastated."
On Tuesday, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA on Tuesday warned it could make up to 12,000 workers 
redundant at British Airways.
Dublin-based Ryanair's outlook for its first half and beyond is bleak. Travel restrictions mean its first quarter traffic 
will be more than 99% lower than initially planned. 
It expects traffic of fewer than 150,000 passengers, a fraction of its initial forecast of 42.4 million passengers. It 
expects to operate fewer than 1% of its scheduled flight programme in April, May and June. 
The second quarter, running from July to September, will improve, Ryanair predicted, but its traffic will be a shadow 
of what it hoped for prior to the pandemic. 
"Ryanair expects to carry no more than 50% of its original traffic target of 44.6 million in the second quarter," the 
company said. 
And for the year ending March 2021, Ryanair said it expects to carry not more than 100 million passengers, more 
than 35% below its initial 154 million target. 
Ryanair expects a net loss of EUR100 million in the first quarter, with further losses in the second. 
"When scheduled flights return in Europe, sometime in July, Ryanair believes it will take some time for passenger 
volumes to return. Consumer confidence will be impacted by public health restrictions, such as temperature checks 
at airports and face coverings for passengers and staff on board aircraft," the company predicted. 
Ryanair also expects the market to be fogged by "significant price discounting, and below cost selling from flag 
carriers". The company said many of these firms have "huge state aid war chests". 
Ryanair noted Lufthansa, which it said to date has taken EUR12.4 billion in aid, and recently-renationalised Alitalia. 
Ryanair said: "When Ryanair returns to meaningful flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be 
distorted by unprecedented volumes of state aid from some European Union governments to their 'national' airlines. 
Currently this amounts to over EUR30 billion.
"All this state aid is in breach of EU rules, and will distort Europe's level playing field in airline competition for many 
years. Lufthansa, Air France-KLM SA and Alitalia can now fund many years of below cost selling, whereas Ryanair 
and other well run airlines will not request and would not receive such state aid. Ryanair will challenge these 
unlawful state aid bailouts in the EU courts."
Elsewhere, Ryanair noted it is in talks with manufacturer Boeing Co to cut the number of planned aircraft deliveries 
over the next two year, in a bid to cut its costs in a "post Covid-19 world". 
"Ryanair entered this unprecedented Covid-19 crisis with almost EUR4 billion in cash, and we continue to actively 
manage these cash resources to ensure that we can survive this Covid-19 pandemic, and more importantly the 
return to lower fare flight schedules as soon as possible," the company summarised. 
Ryanair shares were 4.4% lower at EUR9.86 each in London on Friday following the announcement.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are called lower on Friday morning, as damaging economic data from the 
European Central Bank weighed on sentiment and despite a promise by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to 
provide a plan to exit lockdown.
In early UK company news, Royal Bank of Scotland suffered the same fate as peers, with profit falling sharply on 
increased impairments, as Ryanair is set to cut 3,000 jobs amid government-impose travel restrictions.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open points 90.31 lower at 5,810.90 on Friday. The 
blue-chip index closed down 214.04 points, or 3.5%, at 5,901.21 Thursday.
CMC Markets Chief Market Analyst Michael Hewson said: "Despite posting their best month since October 2015, 
European stocks finished April with a whimper, falling sharply, after a raft of economic data showed that for all the 
concerns about how bad the economic data is set to be in the second quarter, the lockdowns imposed in March 
also extracted an even heavier than expected economic price in the first quarter."
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Thursday warned that the euro area is facing an 
"unprecedented" peacetime economic contraction due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Her remarks came in a press conference after the central bank said it stands ready to increase the size of its 
pandemic emergency purchase programme, if needed, as it kept eurozone interest rates steady.
Measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 "have largely halted economic activity" across both the euro bloc and 
the globe, Lagarde said. Survey indicators for consumer and business sentiment have plunged, suggesting a sharp 
contraction in economic growth and "a profound deterioration" in labour market conditions.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: RBS Impairments Up; Ryanair To Cut 3,000 Jobs
There are high levels of uncertainty surrounding the ultimate extent of the economic fallout, so ECB forecasts 
suggest euro area GDP could fall by between 5% to 12% this year - with much depending on the duration of 
containment measures.
The forecasts come just hours after Eurostat said the eurozone economy contracted 3.8% quarter-on-quarter in the 
first three months of 2020, and shrank 3.5% in the wider European Union. Annually, GDP fell 3.3% in the euro area 
and by 2.7% in the EU.
The euro traded at USD1.0963 early Friday, firm on USD1.0874 late Thursday.
Hewson continued: "Markets appeared to have convinced themselves, that for all of the damage that was coming in 
the second quarter, that the first quartet wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as yesterday's initial estimates 
suggested it would. The fact that it was even worse, and with a lot of the more recent data still to come through, 
prompted a sharp reassessment of the likelihood of a v-shaped recovery, that had prompted a lot of the gains that 
we’ve seen in the past month."
In the UK, Prime Minister Johnson promised to deliver a "comprehensive plan" next week on how the lockdown 
may be eased after declaring the UK is "past the peak" of the coronavirus outbreak.
Johnson said on Thursday he would be producing a "road map, a menu of options" explaining how to get the 
economy moving and children back to school while still suppressing the disease's spread.
In Asia on Friday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 2.7%. Japan's manufacturing sector saw its 
downturn intensify in April with production falling at the sharpest rate since 2009, IHS Markit data showed.
The headline au Jibun Bank purchasing managers' index dropped to an 11-year low of 41.9 in April from 44.8 in 
March. Any reading over 50 indicates expansion in the sector and one below contraction.
Financial markets in China and across Europe - including Germany and France - are closed Friday for the Labour 
Day holiday.
In London, RBS followed UK banking peers earlier this week in reporting a sharp drop in profit due to a significant 
rise in credit impairments.
Operating pretax profit dropped to GBP519 million in the first quarter from GBP1.01 billion a year before.
The lender upped its impairment losses to GBP802 million for the period from just GBP86 million a year before.
Net interest income was down to GBP1.94 billion from GBP2.03 billion, as the lender's net interest margin 
worsened to 1.89% from 2.07%.
This was partly offset by its customer loan book rising to GBP351.3 billion from GBP306.4 billion.
RBS ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 16.6% versus 16.2% the year before.
"We remain committed to the strategic objectives and priorities we announced as part of our full year 2019 results. 
Whilst we are closely monitoring events and assessing potential scenarios and outcomes, reflecting the significant 
deterioration in economic outlook and unprecedented levels of uncertainty, it would be inappropriate to provide an 
update on medium-term outlook at this time," RBS said.
At rival Lloyds Banking, Chief Operating Officer Juan Colombas has agreed to stay in his post until September. 
Colombas was scheduled to retire in July but has agreed to stay on and help the lender deal with the Covid-19 
crisis.
Housebuilder Barratt Developments said its construction work will recommence on May 11.

Barratt will start a phased return to construction, with 180 sites - around 50% of the total - in the first phase. The

Barratt said a "significant proportion" of the 85% of its workforce that has been furloughed will be able to return to

reservations. We expect reservations to continue at low levels until our sales centres and show homes reopen," 
Barratt said. 
The housebuilder will prioritise work on sold plots at advanced stages of construction, and therefore expects a 
limited number of additional completions this financial year.
At April 26, Barratt has completed 11,776 homes - versus 11,723 the year before. Total forward sales stand at 
12,271 with a value of GBP2.85 billion.
Barratt said it continues to be financially strong, with about GBP430 million of cash at April 28.
Budget airline Ryanair said it expects a significant decline in air traffic in 2020, but bemoaned the "distorted" playing 
field as it charged that legacy European airlines have received over EUR30 billion in state aid.
Ryanair said this is a "clear breach" of both EU competition and state aid rules.

Due to continent-wide EU government flight restrictions, Ryanair expects to operate less than 1% of its scheduled 
flying program in April, May and June.
First-quarter traffic is expected to be down 96% year on year at 150,000 passengers.
In the US on Thursday, Wall Street closed in the red, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending down 1.2%, the 
S&P 500 down 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite closing 0.3% lower.
After the bell in New York, tech giant Amazon and Apple released first-quarter results - which followed news that 
another 3.8 million Americans had filed jobless claims, taking the overall total of claims to over 30 million.
Apple said it made a profit of USD11.2 billion on sales of USD58.3 billion in the quarter, compared to net income of 
USD11.7 billion on revenue of USD58 billion in the same period a year earlier.
"Despite COVID-19's unprecedented global impact, we're proud to report that Apple grew for the quarter, driven by 
an all-time record in services and a quarterly record for wearables," Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an earnings 
release.
Net sales of iPhones – the big earnings segment for Apple in recent years – dropped 6.7% from a year earlier

Amazon said profits took a hit in the past quarter due to the global pandemic and that its earnings in current period 
would be wiped out by COVID-related expenses.
The technology and e-commerce giant said revenue surged 26% in the quarter to more than USD75 billion as 
people hunkered down at home due to the pandemic turned to it for supplies and entertainment.
But profits slipped 29% from a year ago to USD2.5 billion.
Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said all profits in the April-June quarter would be erased by expenses linked to the 
global virus outbreak.
Elsewhere in the US, President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened China with fresh tariffs as he stepped up his 
attacks on Beijing over the coronavirus crisis, saying he had seen evidence linking a Wuhan lab to the contagion.
Asked if he had seen anything giving him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the 
source of the outbreak, Trump replied, "Yes, I have."
Pressed by reporters at the White House for details on what made him so confident, Trump replied: "I cannot tell 
you that."
Trump is increasingly making Beijing's handling of the outbreak a major issue for his November re-election 
campaign.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.2565 early Friday, down from USD1.2601 at the London equities close on Thursday.
Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY107.06, up from JPY106.94.
Gold was at USD1,676.50 an ounce early Friday, lower than USD1,704.48 on Thursday.
Brent oil rose to USD26.85 a barrel early Friday from USD26.50 late Thursday.

(Alliance News) - US President Donald Trump has said he has seen evidence the new coronavirus originated in a 
Chinese lab, an assertion that threatened on Friday to turn a global health emergency into a diplomatic crisis.
The US president's statement was immediately undermined by intelligence officials and top diplomat Mike Pompeo, 
who said: "We don't know precisely where it began."
But the claim – already denied by Beijing – could stir tensions even as the World Health Organization asks to be 
allowed to take part in a Chinese investigation into the "animal origins" of the pandemic.
The lockdowns that have frozen the global economy for weeks continued to ease, with South Africa and Austria 
allowing some businesses to reopen from Friday, joining other parts of Europe and some US states that have 
begun to emerge in the last few days.
But optimistic news was tempered by a further haemorrhaging of jobs, with 30 million Americans newly unemployed 
since lockdown began, and Spain joining its European neighbours in confirming an economic collapse.
Spain's Finance Minister Nadia Calvino said its economy was projected to shrink by 9.2% in 2020 – after growing 
by two percent last year – while unemployment would jump to 19% from an already high 13.8.
Underlining the slump in consumer demand, Irish airline Ryanair said it was slashing 3,000 positions, forecasting 
passenger numbers would not recover until mid-2022. 
While death rates slowed in most of Europe, the global toll from the pandemic has now topped 230,000.
Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a 
market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.
UPDATE: Trump Points Finger At China Lab, WHO Asks To Join Virus Probe
But speculation – reinforced by internet rumours and America's right-wing radio shock jocks – has swirled about a 
top-secret lab, and seems to have been taken up by the US president.
Asked if he had seen anything to make him think the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source of the outbreak, 
Trump replied: "Yes, I have."
But he refused to give details and Secretary of State Pompeo indicated he had not seen definitive evidence.
"We don't know if it came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We don't know if it emanated from the wet market or 
yet some other place. We don't know those answers."
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said analysts would "continue to rigorously examine emerging 
information and intelligence to determine" the origin of the outbreak.
In Geneva, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said several investigations into the source of the virus 
were going on, adding that the global agency was "not currently involved in the studies in China".
"WHO would be keen to work with international partners and, at the invitation of the Chinese government, to 
participate in investigation around the animal origins," Tarik Jasarevic told AFP
Beijing has denied the lab was the source of the virus.
Last month foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said WHO officials "have repeatedly stated that there is no 
single evidence that the new coronavirus was produced in a laboratory".
"Many well-known medical experts in the world also believe that the so-called laboratory leak hypothesis has no 
scientific basis,"
Trump is making Beijing's handling of the outbreak a major issue for his November re-election campaign.
When asked about reports that he could cancel US debt obligations to China, Trump said he could "do it differently" 
and act in "more of a forthright manner".
"I could do the same thing but even for more money, just putting on tariffs," he said.
The coronavirus has infected at least 3.2 million people so far, with Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin 
becoming the latest high-profile figure to test positive as his country's caseload surged past 100,000.
But there was some reason for cheer.
Germany has accelerated plans to start lifting its lockdown, preparing to ease curbs on public life and reopen 
religious institutions, museums and zoos – having restarted shopping last week.
Neighbouring Austria followed suit on Friday with people allowed to go out again freely and gather as long as the 
group does not exceed 10 people – or 30 for funerals. 
Those who do not live in the same household must remain three feet from each other. Masks must worn in shops 
and public buildings and on public transport. Hairdressers and bigger shops are expected to open again from 
Saturday.
Italy, once the world centre of the outbreak, said it was hoping to reopen two major airports next week but would 
move slowly.
And UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, recovering from Covid-19, said his country – which has the world's third-
highest death toll, behind the US and Italy – would publish a roadmap next week on easing restrictions.

Malaysia said it would reopen for business next week, and Australia's government said it could begin easing 
restrictions soon.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Royal Bank of Scotland reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profit, as it was forced to significantly increase its 
credit impairments to cope with the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. In the three months to March 31, the state-
backed lender's operating pretax profit nearly halved to GBP519 million from GBP1.01 billion in the same period the 
year before. RBS recorded GBP802 million in impairment losses in the quarter, up from GBP86 million a year 
before. Over the past week, London's blue-chip lenders have taken a total GBP7.50 billion in credit loss 
impairments. The credit losses represents 90 basis points of gross customer loans, compared to 11 basis points the 
year before. The significant rise, RBS said, was to cover the "more uncertain economic outlook". Net interest 
income was down 4.4% year on year at GBP1.94 billion from GBP2.03 billion. Total income was up 3.9% however 
at GBP3.16 billion.
----------
Irish budget airline Ryanair could slash up to 3,000 jobs as it embarks on a restructuring in response to destructive 
effects the Covid-19 has had pandemic on travel. Ryanair also took aim at what it labelled as "state-aid doping", to 
which the likes of airline Deutsche Lufthansa and Anglo-German holiday operator TUI have turned in the face of the 
ongoing health crisis. Ryanair expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing to 2019 levels will take at 
least 2 years, until summer 2022 at the earliest. Dublin-based Ryanair's outlook for its first half and beyond is bleak. 
Travel restrictions mean its first quarter traffic will be more than 99% lower than initially planned. It expects traffic of 
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair Set For Heavy Job Cuts Amid Bailout Fight
fewer than 150,000 passengers, a fraction of its initial forecast of 42.4 million passengers. It expects to operate 
fewer than 1% of its scheduled flight programme in April, May and June.
----------
Barratt Developments said work will resume at its construction sites on May 11, although its sales centres and show 
homes will remain closed. In April, peers Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Vistry Group made similar 
announcements of a phased re-opening of their construction sites. Work at Barratt's construction sites will 
recommence starting May 11 and the return will be phased, with around 50% or 180 of its sites reopened in the first 
phase - but all sites in Scotland will remain closed. At April 26, Barratt had completed 11,776 homes, slightly more 
than the 11,723 homes completed at the same time in 2019 including joint ventures. Forward sales amounted to 
12,271 homes at a value of GBP2.85 billion. Cost base and cash flow measures implemented in response to the 
pandemic include the suspension of all land buying, as well as all recruitment activity. Non-essential capital 
expenditure has been postponed and cash flows are now being actively managed.
----------
Amazon.com said Thursday profit took a hit in the past quarter due to the global pandemic and that its earnings in 
current period would be wiped out by Covid-related expenses. The technology and e-commerce giant said revenue 
surged 26% in the quarter to more than USD75 billion as people hunkered down at home due to the pandemic 
turned to it for supplies and entertainment. But profit slipped 29% from a year ago to USD2.5 billion. Chief 
Executive Jeff Bezos said all profit in the April-June quarter would be erased by expenses linked to the global virus 
outbreak. Amazon said it expects anything from a USD1.5 billion operating loss to a USD1.5 billion operating profit 
in the second quarter to June 30.
----------
Apple on Thursday reported revenue slipped in the first three months of this year as revenue inched higher despite 
the pandemic's hit. Apple said it made a profit of USD11.2 billion on sales of USD58.3 billion in the quarter, 
compared to net income of USD11.7 billion on revenue of USD58 billion in the same period a year earlier. "Despite 
Covid-19's unprecedented global impact, we're proud to report that Apple grew for the quarter, driven by an all-time 
record in services and a quarterly record for wearables," Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an earnings release. Net 
sales of iPhones – the big earnings segment for Apple in recent years – dropped 6.7% from a year earlier to USD29 
billion in a period where smartphone sales have been sagging, but services revenue rose 17% to USD13.35 billion.
----------
MARKETS
----------
US President Donal Trump threatened fresh tariffs against China Thursday night, reigniting a trade war that had 
been put on the backburner by the coronavirus pandemic.
As a result, the few financial markets that were open today were pushed into the red.
Adding further pressure was a dismal UK manufacturing PMI, with the print hitting a 28-year low.
The US looks set for a bleak open to the month, with all three major indices called to open at least 1.9% lower, with 
the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite called 2.5% lower on disappointing quarterly updates from Amazon and Apple.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK manufacturing sector saw "substantial disruption" in April, as output, new orders and employment fell at 
record rates amid the coronavirus pandemic. Manufacturing production, new orders and employment all contracted 
at the fastest rates in the 28-year survey history, IHS Markit said, while vendor lead times lengthened to their 
greatest extent in the survey's history. The global pandemic also hit overseas demand, leading to a series-record 
drop in new export business. The IHS Markit-Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply purchasing managers' 
index fell to 32.6 in April from 47.8 in March, significantly below both the no-change mark of 50 and slightly below 
the flash reading of 32.9.
----------
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to deliver a "comprehensive plan" next week on how the lockdown 
may be eased after declaring the UK is "past the peak" of the coronavirus outbreak. Johnson said on Thursday he 
would be producing a "road map, a menu of options" explaining how to get the economy moving and children back 
to school while still suppressing the disease's spread. Testing is a key part of the strategy in any effort to ease 
restrictions, and the public may find out on Friday if the government reached its target of carrying out 100,000-a-day 
by the end of Thursday.
----------
US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened China with fresh tariffs as he stepped up his attacks on Beijing 
over the coronavirus crisis, saying he had seen evidence linking a Wuhan lab to the contagion. The virus is believed 
to have originated late last year in a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan that sold wild animals for human 
consumption, but speculation has swirled about a top-secret lab in the ground-zero city. Asked if he had seen 
anything giving him a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source of the 
outbreak, Trump replied, "Yes, I have." Pressed by reporters at the White House for details on what made him so 
confident, Trump replied: "I cannot tell you that." Trump is increasingly making Beijing's handling of the outbreak a 
major issue for his November re-election campaign. When asked about reports that he could cancel US debt 
obligations to China, Trump said he could "do it differently" and act in "probably a little bit more of a forthright 
manner." "I could do the same thing but even for more money, just putting on tariffs," he said.
----------
Japan's manufacturing sector had its downturn intensify in April with production falling at the sharpest rate since 
2009, IHS Markit data showed. The headline au Jibun Bank purchasing managers' index dropped to an eleven-year 
low of 41.9 in April from 44.8 in March. Order books slid deeper into contraction and sales dropped at the fastest 
rate for over eleven years amid reports of order cancellations. Overseas demand dropped and new export orders 
fell at a rate not seen since the height of the financial crisis.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Friday it expects profit for its recently ended financial 
year to remain within its guidance range, albeit at the lower end, as traffic for March fell due to airspace closures 
related to Covid-19.
For the year ended March 31, post-tax profit before exceptional items is set to be at the lower end of the guidance 
range between EUR950 million and EUR1.00 billion, compared to EUR1.02 billion the year before.
Ryanair said the expected weaker performance was due the response of EU governments to the spread of the 
Covid-19 virus, which has included flight bans and travels restrictions.
For March alone, when the restrictions were first imposed, the group's passenger numbers plunged 48% year-on-
year to 5.7 million from 10.9 million. The Ryanair core airline's numbers were also down 48%, to 5.5 million, while 
the newer Lauda division in Austria saw a 50% drop to 200,000 passengers.
On a rolling annual basis, the group's passenger numbers edged up by 4% to 148.6 million.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said it expects its fleet to remain largely grounded for at least April and May, which will lead 
to the group recording ineffectiveness of its fuel hedges for the 2021 financial year as an exceptional item for its 
2020 results.
The Irish company said it is unable to give guidance for the 2021 financial year.
Ryanair said it has a strong balance sheet, with year-end cash equivalents of EUR3.8 billion and 77% of its owned 
fleet unencumbered and debt free. 
It has already implemented several measures to cut operating costs and improve liquidity, including aircraft 
grounding, share buyback suspensions and cutting all pay by 50% for April and May.

"We are grateful to many EU governments for their foresight and speed of response in recognising that the EU 
airlines are one of the most exposed industries to the Covid-19 pandemic and that our flights have been grounded 
by necessary government restrictions to combat the spread of Covid-19.  However, we equally support the EU 
Commission's position that any such government supports must comply with all EU State Aid and Competition 
rules," Ryanair stated.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.3% at EUR8.52 on Friday in London.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening in the red on Friday despite markets in the US having a 
strong session overnight due to a rising oil price. 
In London, bus operators welcomed financial help from the UK government but budget airline Ryanair reported a 
drop in passenger numbers with nearly its entire fleet now grounded due to the Covid-19 health crisis. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 20.0 points lower at 5,460.22. The blue-chip index closed up 
25.65 points, or 0.5%, at 5,480.22 on Thursday. 
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world has soared past one million and deaths have topped 
50,000 as the US reported the highest daily death toll of any country so far.
Despite more than half the planet living in some form of lockdown, the virus is continuing to spread rapidly and to 
claim lives at an alarming pace, with the US, Spain and the UK all seeing their worst days yet.
The economic cost of the pandemic is getting starker by the day, with new figures on Thursday showing that an 
extra 6.6 million Americans signed on for unemployment benefit last week, taking to 10 million the number of people 
who lost their jobs in the last two weeks of March.
Oil, however, was boosted by US President Donald Trump saying oil production cuts are imminent after talks with 
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. 
"Oil soared 35% after Trump tweeted he expects Saudi and Russia to curb production by as much as 15 million 
barrels to halt the meltdown in oil. His tweet didn't mention if this amount would be per day, or over an extended 
period," said Ipek Ozkardeskaya at Swissquote Bank. 
"And given the very significant number, we wouldn't be surprised to see investors disappointed by a much smaller 
action if there is any in the first place."

Brent oil was quoted at USD28.69 a barrel, retreating from USD30.02 at the London close Thursday. Brent had hit 
an intra-day high of USD36.16. 
In the US on Thursday, Wall Street ended in the green, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 2.2%, the 
S&P 500 up 2.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.7%. 
The session was boosted by gains for oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil, which ended 11% and 7.6% higher 
respectively as the oil price jumped. 
On Friday comes the closely-watched US jobs report for March, although the numbers could mask the full extent of 
the damage Covid-19 has caused to the world's largest economy.
The US economy is expected to have lost 100,000 jobs in March, while the unemployment rate is seen at 3.8%, up 
from 3.5% in February.
This jobs report will follow Thursday's initial jobless claims which reached a fresh record high. For the week ended 
March 28, seasonally-adjusted initial claims were a whopping 6.6 million, with the previous week's level revised up 
by 24,000 to stand at just over 3.3 million.
For perspective, the record high before the past two readings was 695,000, recorded in October 1982.  
"Looking at the devastating jobless claims figures, it is possible we see significantly worse figures," added 
Ozkardeskaya. 
In London early Friday, UK travel operators welcomed financial support from the UK government for the bus sector 
amid the collapse in demand caused by Covid-19. 
Bus companies in England will receive almost GBP170 million in new government funding to ensure services 
continue to operate during the coronavirus pandemic.
UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Friday the investment will protect crucial local transport links across 
England for those unable to work from home.
FirstGroup Chief Executive said he was "pleased" with the help, while his counterpart at Go-Ahead Group David 
Brown said he was "very pleased". Stagecoach said the aid was "welcome". 
In the FTSE 100, defence company BAE Systems said it is in a "strong" position with a large order backlog, mainly 
in the form of contracts from governments across the world. 
The balance sheet is strong, BAE continued, as is liquidity. Covid-19 has had no material impact on financial 
performance in the first quarter of 2020, though disruption is beginning to increase. 
However, BAE has still decided to defer its 13.8 pence per share final dividend for 2019 declared in February. An 
update on the dividend will be provided in July when reporting results for the first half of 2020. 
Back in the FTSE 250, events and data firm Ascential has taken the "difficult" decision to cancel the Cannes Lions 
festival this year, having already postponed it due to Covid-19. 
Ascential said it would not have been commercially viable to run it this year, with the next edition running in June 
2021. 
Ascential has decided to withdraw the 4.0p per share final payout for 2019 declared earlier this year, which will save 
it GBP15 million. Salary increases, including for some executive and non-executive directors, have also been 
halted. 
Great Portland Estates said it is financially strong but warned only 62.9% of rent due in the first quarter of 2020 was 
collected, compared to 99.2% a year before and 99.3% in the last quarter of 2019. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Bus Firms Welcome Help; Ryanair Numbers Halve
Another 4.5% for the quarter is expected imminently, Great Portland said, with over half of the outstanding amount 
from retail, hospitality and leisure. 
Elsewhere, budget airline Ryanair reported a 48% fall in passenger numbers in March to 5.7 million, as airlines bear 
the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic. It operated 33,000 flights in March, just under half of the budgeted number 
of 64,000. 
Ryanair expects to carry out "minimal if any" traffic during April and May. It is currently operating less than 20 flights 
a day. 
The firm expects pre-exceptional items post-tax profit of between EUR950 million and EUR1.00 billion in the 
financial year ended March 31, which is at the lower end of the previously guided range. 
Ryanair will be booking a EUR300 million charge due to the ineffectiveness of fuel hedges made for financial 2021, 
it added. 
Ryanair stressed it has one of the "strongest" balance sheets in the industry. No guidance is yet possible for its 
newly begun financial year.
Online trading firm CMC Markets said net trading revenue has been strong over its year ended March 31, especially 
in the last quarter due to a rise in market activity.
CMC sees contract-for-difference revenue nearly doubling to GBP214 million, while its stockbroking business is set 
to double annual revenue, to GBP32 million. 
CMC has reaffirmed its policy of paying a total annual dividend of 50% of post-tax profit. 
In Asia on Friday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed flat after a late surge. In China, the Shanghai Composite is 
down 0.7%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.7%.
China's services sector recovered somewhat in March, data from Caixin showed on Friday, but still remained in 
contraction territory.
The headline business activity index rose to 43.0 from a record low of 26.5 in February, indicating an easing of the 
sector's downturn. The reading did, though, remain below the no-change mark of 50, signalling service sector 
output continued to shrink in March.
Covid-19 continued to weigh on demand in March, as highlighted by a further reduction in total new business. The 
rate of contraction, "though solid", was softer than that seen in February, Caixin said.
Later Friday are more services PMI readings from Germany, the eurozone, the UK and US at 0855 BST, 0900 BST, 
0930 BST and 1445 BST, respectively.

COMPANIES

Associated British Foods warned annual earnings will now be much lower than forecast at the start of the financial 
year due, to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Primark clothing chain owner also said it will trim costs, its senior 
managers and directors have also decided to take pay cuts as part of an effort to save cash. Chief Executive 
George Weston and Finance Director John Bason have decided to temporarily reduce their base by 50%. Paul 
Marchant, chief executive of Primark, has decided to take a 50% cut to his base salary.

BAE Systems believes it is in a "strong position" to withstand any fallout caused by Covid-19 but expects a 
"challenging period". The defence, security, and aerospace firm, however, has decided to defer its 2019 dividend to 
preserve cash. BAE said its "large" order backlog, with long-term government contracts, should shield it from "these 
difficult times". As the second quarter has progressed, BAE has seen "more significant disruptions" from the virus 
outbreak.

ITV joined the long list of UK-listed companies deciding to cut pay for senior managers and board directors in a bid 
to conserve cash amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The FTSE 100-listed company said its remuneration committee has 
decided to cancel annual bonuses for executive directors and management board, and there will be no cash bonus

payable to them in respect of the company's performance in 2020. The company's executive directors and 
management board have also agreed a 20% pay cut for the duration of the UK government-imposed lockdown. If 
the lockdown continues beyond June-end, ITV plans to review the pay reduction arrangement at that time. 
Furthermore, ITV's non-executive directors have taken a 20% fee reduction while the lockdown lasts.

Ryanair Holdings said it expects profit for its recently ended financial year to remain within its guidance range, albeit 
at the lower end, as traffic for March fell due to airspace closures related to Covid-19. For the year ended March 31, 
post-tax profit before exceptional items is set to be at the lower end of the guidance range between EUR950 million 
and EUR1.00 billion, compared to EUR1.02 billion the year before. Ryanair said the expected weaker performance 
was due the response of EU governments to the spread of the Covid-19 virus, which has included flight bans and 
travels restrictions. Looking ahead, Ryanair said it expects its fleet to remain largely grounded for at least April and 
May, which will lead to the group recording ineffectiveness of its fuel hedges for the 2021 financial year as an 
exceptional item for its 2020 results.

Stagecoach Group, FirstGroup and Go-Ahead Group all welcomed the news that the UK government would provide 
financial support for the bus sector amid the plunge in demand during the Covid-19 outbreak. Bus companies in 
England will receive almost GBP170 million in new government funding to ensure services continue to operate 
during the coronavirus pandemic. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Friday the investment will protect 
crucial local transport links across England for those unable to work from home. Bus operators will be required to 
maintain up to 50% of normal service levels and allow adequate social distancing space between passengers on 
board under the conditions of the new GBP167 million funding pot.

UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Services Sector Suffers Record Slump In March
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK services sector registered its biggest decline in survey history in March, IHS Markit-CIPS reported. The 
services PMI read 34.5 in March, compared to the initial flash figure of 35.7 and the 53.2 recorded in February. The 
previous record low had been recorded at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008-09, IHS Markit said, and 
March's performance was "by far" the worst since the survey began in July 1996. The composite PMI, which 
encompasses both services and manufacturing, slumped to 36.0 in March, compared to the flash reading of 37.1 
and February's 53.0. The UK economy is "almost certain" to experience deep contraction in the second quarter of 
2020, said Markit's Tim Moore. 
----------
The eurozone's services sector was pummelled by virus-forced standstills in March. The IHS Markit services 
business activity index fell to a record low of 26.4 in March, below 50, meaning the sector is in decline, from 52.6 in 
February. The composite purchasing managers' index - compiled using services and manufacturing data from 
earlier in the week - fell to 29.7, below the 31.4 flash estimate and a large slump from 51.6 in February. Germany's 
composite PMI slumped to 35.0 in March from 50.7 in February, while data showed France's composite PMI 
crashed to a historic low of 28.9, from 52.0 in February. In Italy, it dropped to 20.2 from 50.7 and in Spain to 26.7 
from 51.8.
----------
China's services sector recovered somewhat in March, data from Caixin showed, but still remained in contraction 
territory. The headline business activity index rose to 43.0 from a record low of 26.5 in February, indicating an 
easing of the sector's downturn. Covid-19 continued to weigh on demand in March, as highlighted by a further 
reduction in total new business. The rate of contraction, "though solid", was softer than that seen in February, 
Caixin said. 
----------
Energy ministers from the OPEC+ oil cartel will conduct a video conference on Monday, in an effort to find a way to 
stabilize prices for the commodity, Azerbaijan announced. "This meeting is being held at the invitation of the 
kingdom of Saudi Arabia after the talks mediated by US President Donald Trump," Azerbaijan's Energy Ministry 
said in a statement. The meeting will include the members of the Vienna-based Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries and allied oil-producing states in the OPEC+ format, such as Azerbaijan and Russia, according 
to the statement. A Vienna-based source confirmed that OPEC+ ministers will conduct talks on Monday, which may 
be joined by additional countries. Azerbaijan, an oil-rich, former Soviet republic on the Caspian Sea, has close 
economic relations with Russia. Trump said on Thursday that he expected Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut oil 
production in an effort to stabilize prices.
----------
The US recorded 1,169 Covid-19 fatalities in the past 24 hours, the Johns Hopkins University tracker showed 
Thursday, the highest one-day death toll recorded in any country since the global pandemic began. The toll 
reflected figures reported by the university between 0030 GMT and the same time Thursday. The grim record was 
previously held by Italy, where 969 people died on March 27. The US has now recorded 5,926 coronavirus deaths 
since the start of the pandemic. Globally, Italy still has the highest total death toll, with 13,915 dying of the disease 
there, followed by Spain at 10,003.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened lower on Monday with oil majors weighing on the FTSE 100 as oil 
prices sank, while easyjet was lower after grounding its entire fleet.
The large-cap FTSE 100 index was down 31.36 points, or 0.4%, at 5,478.97.
The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was down 99.55 points, or 0.7%, at 14,670.25. The AIM All-Share index was down 
0.4% at 661.44.
The Cboe UK 100 index was down 0.3% at 9,284.81. The Cboe 250 was down 0.3% at 12,743.75, and the Cboe 
Small Companies was flat at 8,052.68.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris and DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 1.7% and 0.6% respectively early 
Monday.
"After an initial flurry higher the European markets were dragged lower on Monday, the unavoidable fact of oil's 
continued decline especially hurting the FTSE," Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell said.
In the FTSE 100, Johnson Matthey was the best performer, up 3.2% despite the speciality chemicals company 
saying it was unable to provide any outlook due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Johnson Matthey said it has a strong balance sheet and good access to liquidity with substantial cash resources 
and significant undrawn bank facilities.
However, the platinum and chemicals firm said that it currently expects to take a hit of around GBP50 million on 
trading performance from Covid-19. This was due to a combination of reduced demand in its Clean Air business, 
which serves the auto industry, and around GBP20 million of delayed shipments caused by logistics challenges 
across other businesses, Johnson Matthey said.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Airlines Tumble After easyJet Grounds Entire Fleet
At the other end of the large cap index, easyJet was down 7.0% after the budget airline said it grounded the 
remainder of its aircraft fleet, after completing hundreds of repatriation flights in the wake of the coronavirus 
outbreak.
easyJet said that at this stage there can be no certainty of the date for restarting commercial flights and will 
continuously evaluate the situation based on regulations and demand.
FTSE 250 peer Wizz Air Holdings was down 5.5%, while Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was down 1.3%.
Oil majors were in the red, tracking spot oil prices lower. BP was down 3.1%, while Royal Dutch Shell 'A' and 'B' 
shares were down 2.9% and 2.5% respectively.
Brent oil was quoted at USD23.44 a barrel Monday morning, down from USD25.03 late Friday. The North Sea 
benchmark fell to USD23.03 overnight  - its lowest level since November 2002.
Shell is London's largest company by market capitalisation, while BP is third biggest.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.9%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 1.0%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2341 Monday morning, down from USD1.2427 at the London equities close Friday.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK will get through the coronavirus crisis "together" after Britons 
were warned restrictions on their lives may last for at least six months. The prime minister issued the words of 
encouragement, praising the 750,000 volunteers who have offered to assist the NHS, from within Downing Street 
where he is isolating having tested positive for Covid-19. 
The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said the nation will not be in "complete lockdown" for 
half a year but said social distancing measures will be lifted gradually. 
The euro was quoted at USD1.1075, flat from USD1.1071 late Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at 
JPY107.75, down from JPY108.07.
Gold was quoted at USD1,613.07 an ounce, lower than USD1,626.20.
The economic events calendar on Monday has UK mortgage approvals at 0930 BST and Germany inflation 
readings at 1300 BST.

(Alliance News) -  The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices on Monday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Johnson Matthey, up 3.7%. The speciality chemicals firm said it expects its trading performance for financial 2020 
to be hurt to the tune of around GBP50 million amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The company attributed the loss of 
around GBP50 million to reduced demand in Clean Air, which serves the largely shut auto industry, as well as the 
delay of around GBP20 million worth of shipments caused by logistics challenges across its other business. 
Johnson Matthey added that it has decided to temporarily close most of its Clean Air plants across the world, 
except in China which is "ramping back up as the region starts to recover from Covid-19". 
----------
Pennon Group, up 2.0%. The water company said it is in strong financial position to continue operations following 
the sale of its Viridor waste management unit. Pennon said its performance in the financial year to the end of March 
was in line with management expectations. Pennon said it is well positioned with strong funding and liquidity to 
weather the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 health crisis. By division, the company said South West Water 
revenue in financial 2020 was reduced due to prolonged wet weather, compared with rainfall experienced last year. 
More positively, Pennon said operationally, South West Water has performed well, ensuring minimal impact to 
customers at times of extreme wet and stormy weather. Looking forward, Pennon said it has GBP1.6 billion of cash 
and committed facilities providing liquidity, with its GBP300 million perpetual capital security approaching the first 
call date in May.

UK WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: easyJet Falls After Grounding Fleet
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
Ashtead Group, down 9.1%. Berenberg downgraded the equipment rental firm to Sell from Hold.
----------
easyJet, down 4.3%. The budget airline said it has fully grounded its entire fleet of aircraft due to "unprecedented" 
travel restrictions imposed by governments around the world in response to the new coronavirus pandemic and the 
implementation of national lockdowns across many European countries. easyJet said that at this stage there can be 
no certainty of the date for restarting commercial flights and will continuously evaluate the situation based on 
regulations and demand. Midcap peer Wizz Air Holdings was down 5.4% and Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was 
down 0.6%. "easyJet isn't flying any planes and most of its staff have been furloughed, so management will have a 
reasonable idea of what costs will be each week from here on out. Unfortunately, investors don't have this 
information so it's impossible to accurately assess easyJet's prospects. We think the group has enough liquidity to 
manage a short suspension of European air travel, but if the disruption proves prolonged or the recovery is sluggish 
easyJet could be in real trouble," said Hargreaves Lansdown. 
----------
FTSE 250 - LOSERS
----------
Dixons Carphone, down 15%. The electrical goods and mobile phone retailer was downgraded to Underperform 
from Sector Perform by RBC Capital.
----------
Hammerson, down 14%. The property investor said it will not recommend paying its final dividend and also 
withdrew its payout guidance. Hammerson, which has retail units among its assets, said some tenants have been 
forced to close stores as national governments impose lockdown measures in a bid to contain the Covid-19 
outbreak. In the UK, where only stores providing essential services remain open, Hammerson said it has so far 
received 37% of rent billed for the second quarter. In addition, Deutsche Bank cut the shopping centre operator to 
Hold from Buy.
----------
Cineworld Group, down 13%. JPMorgan cut the movie theatre operator to Neutral from Overweight.

(Alliance News) - The boss of easyJet PLC has warned airlines could go bankrupt amid the coronavirus outbreak 
without the support from the government.
Johan Lundgren, who appeared in a pre-recorded interview with Robert Peston on ITV on Wednesday evening, 
said the airline has so far cancelled 14,000 flights this month as the virus continues to spread.
His warning came as Ryanair Holdings PLC announced it will cancel more than four out of five flights between 
Thursday and Tuesday next week with an exception for "essential connectivity" journeys.
Airline Jet2.com has suspended all of its flights until next month.
During his interview on Peston, Lundgren said: "Everything from the Gulf War to the 9/11 to the Sars and the 
financial crisis in 2008 and ash cloud, there is nothing as bad as what I see right now. And the issue around it is 
really the uncertainty. You know, when is this going to end."
He added: "If we don't get sufficient levels of support from the government and this continues for that period of time, 
the aviation industry will not be intact."
When asked by Peston to clarify what he meant, he said: "It will not be the way we look at it today… Businesses will 
go bankrupt long before a year from now unless there is support in there."
Lundgren suggested in addition to access to loans on commercial terms, payments on taxes could be deferred as 
efforts to curb the virus continue.
Meanwhile, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps held a call with major airlines an airports on Wednesday and said 
the government was committed to helping the sector while thanking them for helping bring home British nationals 
stranded abroad.

He said: "Coronavirus is having a crippling impact on the aviation industry and we cannot allow it to force world-
leading, well-run, profitable firms out of business.
"We are extremely grateful to airport and airline teams who are continuing to help passengers get home safely. We 
stand firmly behind the sector and expect to announce a series of support measures shortly."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC will cancel "most if not all" of its flights from next Tuesday, said the Irish no-
frills airline as the coronavirus outbreak grounds planes worldwide.
The Dublin-based carrier said it was reducing its flight schedules by 80% until March 24.
From that point, "most if not all Ryanair Group flights will be grounded, except for a very small number of flights to 
maintain essential connectivity, mostly between the UK and Ireland".
The carrier described this as a "severely reduced schedule" and called upon affected passengers to wait upon 
email advice to avoid overloading its telephone call centres.
"Over the past few days, the spread of the COVID-19 virus has led most EU governments to impose severe travel 
bans and restrictions, which have had a negative impact on the schedules of all Ryanair Airlines, causing 
widespread cancellations and travel disruptions across the network," the group added in its statement.
"We advise customers considering travel that all government travel restrictions must be followed. The situation 
changes on a daily basis, and we encourage customers to check relevant local guidelines issued by their 
government before they travel."

(Alliance News) - Italy's government said Tuesday it will re-nationalise the bankrupt former national carrier Alitalia to 
make sure crises like the coronavirus pandemic never strand its compatriots abroad.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's decision was revealed in a government decree published late Monday after more 
than a week of debates.
It comes as part of a broader EUR25 billion coronavirus response plan and will reportedly cost Italian taxpayers up 
to EUR600 million.
The 74-year-old company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and looked doomed in January when it failed to secure 
rescues from either the Italian state railway or Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
"At a time like this, a flag carrier gives the government more leeway," Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli told 
Italian radio.
"We all saw the difficulties our compatriots faced in returning to Italy. Our decision stems from this."
Transport Minister Paola De Micheli said a "national carrier was strategic for our country" at a time of crisis".
Alitalia faced the threat of closure even before COVID-19 killed more than 2,100 people in the Mediterranean 
country and grounded the overwhelming majority of most airlines' flights.
Market intelligence firm CAPA warned that "most airlines in the world will be bankrupt" by the end of May.
But how Conte's government intends to save Alitalia – a member of the SkyTeam alliance that has been bleeding 
money for many years – remains unclear.
TOP NEWS: Italy To Re-Nationalise Failed Alitalia In Response To Virus
The government decree provides for the creation of "a new company wholly controlled by the ministry of economy 
and finance, or controlled by a company with a majority public stake, including an indirect one".
Italy's AGI news agency said the government was also setting up a EUR600 million fund to deal with the damage 
the pandemic was causing the aviation sector.
Some of the final details of the national economic rescue programme are expected to be finalised next month.
Alitalia began to flounder with the emergence of budget fliers such as EasyJet and Ryanair in the 1990s.
But analyst believe that it is also too small – and has too many staff for the number of flights it operates – to 
compete with full-cost rivals.
It flew only 22 million passengers and saw its market share in Italy slip to 14% in 2018.
Lufthansa and the Atlanta-based Delta Airlines each carried around 180 million passengers that year.
Alitalia was privatised by a group of Italian investors for one billion euros in 2008 but went into administration when 
its staff rejected a proposal to cut jobs in 2017.
It is currently 49% owned by Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways and 51% owned by the Italian management team.
Etihad made no immediate comment.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said travel restrictions imposed by governments to curb the 
spread the new coronavirus are hurting its operations. 
Shares in Ryanair were down 20% at EUR8.45 in London in morning trading.
The Irish budget airline said it expects these restrictions to result in the grounding of the majority of its aircraft fleet 
across Europe over the next seven to ten days. For April and May, Ryanair said it now expects to reduce its seat 
capacity by up to 80%.  
Ryanair said it is taking immediate action to reduce operating expenses, and improve cash flows, which includes 
grounding surplus aircraft, deferring all capital expenditure and share buybacks, freezing recruitment and 
discretionary spending, and implementing a series of voluntary leave options, temporarily suspending employment 
contracts, and significant reductions to working hours and payments. 
The airline noted that it has "strong" cash and cash equivalents of over EUR4 billion as at Thursday last week. 
"We have seen a substantial decline in bookings over the last two weeks, and we expect this will continue for the 
foreseeable future. We will continue to monitor demand, as well as government flight restrictions, and we will 
continue to make further cuts to schedules as necessary," Ryanair said in its statement Monday. 
Earlier on Monday, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, easyJet PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC also 
warned of major disruptions to their operations.
British Airways parent IAG said its first-quarter capacity, or available seat kilometres, is expected to fall 7.5%. In 
April and May, IAG will reduce its capacity by about 75% compared to the year before. IAG also is planning to 
ground surplus aircraft. 
UPDATE: Ryanair Joins European, US Airlines In Warning Over Covid-19
As at March 12, IAG had cash, cash equivalents and interest-bearing deposits of EUR7.35 billion. In addition, 
undrawn general and committed aircraft backed financing facilities amount to EUR1.9 billion, resulting in total 
liquidity of EUR9.3 billion.
easyJet also said it has undertaken further "significant" cancellations amid reduced levels of customer demand. 
easyJet currently has GBP1.6 billion cash balance, an undrawn USD500 million revolving credit facility and 
unencumbered aircraft worth in excess of GBP4 billion. The company has no debt re-financings due until 2022, it 
noted.
Meanwhile, Wizz Air said that it has suspended all flights to Poland until further notice due to the Polish 
government's decision to impose travel restrictions imposed on all foreign flights. Wizz Air said it has EUR1.3 billion 
of free cash. 
The announcements in London mirrored those in the US and Europe over the weekend, after US President Donald 
Trump's administration banned foreign travellers arriving from Europe.
American Airlines Group Inc said it would reduce all international capacity by 75%. It also said domestic service 
would be reduced by 20% in April compared to last year. 
Delta said it would "significantly reduce its US to Europe flying beginning Monday, March 16, following the US 
government directive restricting travel between the US and Europe."
Southwest Airlines said it "will likely make service reductions based on demand".
Germany's flagship carrier Deutsche Lufthansa AG said its flight schedule will be reduced by up to 70% over the 
next few weeks, along with other cost savings measures. It said this was in response to a 50% drop in new 
bookings over the past week, compared to a year before.

German tourism firm TUI is suspending the "majority" of its operations over coronavirus fears, and made a request 
for state aid. TUI, which employs 70,000 people worldwide, said the move would affect its "package travel, cruises 
and hotel operations". Hannover-based TUI has a presence in over 100 countries and operates a host of airlines, 
cruise ships and hundreds of hotels. The firm was taking "substantial cost measures" to mitigate the effect on its 
earnings, adding that it would apply for state aid guarantees "to support the business until normal operations are 
resumed". It also said it was withdrawing its profit forecast for the current financial year.
----------
Associated British Foods said Primark finally succumbed to disruption caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, with store 
closures set to cost the discount-fashion chain GBP190 million in sales over the next month. Stores in France, 
Spain, Austria and Italy, where governments have imposed lockdowns, have been forced into temporary closure. 
"These stores currently generate 30% of Primark's sales. From the date of this announcement, we had expected 
sales of GBP190 million from these stores over the next four weeks," AB Foods said. In the UK, which represents 
41% of Primark sales, like-for-likes have declined over the last two weeks amid reduced footfall. The update on 
Monday comes after AB Foods issued a more promising statement in late-February. At the time, AB Foods said 
Primark was yet to experience any short-term pain from the coronavirus outbreak. Elsewhere, AB Foods said it has 
not seen "a material impact" in the sugar, grocery, ingredients and agriculture businesses.
----------
Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment said its full-year before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation could 
take a hit between GBP90 million and GBP110 million if governments and sports regulators continue to cancel 
events until the end of August due to the spread of Covid-19. Flutter said: "In recent days, many national 
governments and sports authorities around the world have made the decision to postpone/cancel high attendance 
sports events in an effort to delay the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Flutter's estimates assume that UK and Ireland 
shops remain open, with horse racing fixtures in the two countries, and Australia, continue to run. Should they not, 
its full-year Ebitda could take a further GBP30 million hit every month. A stacked sporting calendar has suffered a 
string of cancellations, with doubts over whether the European football season will continue and organisers mulling 
postponing the Euro 2020 tournament by a year.
----------
Carnival said it has suspended operations of four additional North American cruise brands for one month. On 
Thursday last week, the cruise ship operator had said its Princess Cruises division would voluntarily pause its 
global operations for sixty days in response to the "unpredictable circumstances" evolving from the spread of Covid-
19 virus. On Monday, Carnival said Carnival Cruise Line, Cunard North America, Holland America Line and 
Seabourn also will suspend operations for one month, putting a pause on new voyages. "Through serving our many 
guests who still wanted to travel, we've stood with all the people in the port communities here in the US, and in the 
other places we sail, who are dependent on us for their livelihood. Today we stand with the nation as we together 
seek to mitigate the spread," said Carnival Corp Chief Executive Arnold Donald.
----------
Miner Rio Tinto said it is working with the government of Mongolia to ensure Oyu Tolgoi is operating in accordance 
with the restrictions put in place to contain the spread of Covid-19. Oyu Tolgoi, located in the South Gobi region of 
Mongolia, is copper and gold deposit. Since January, the movement of goods and people within Mongolia have 
been restricted within and across its border, and this has further escalated recently as the first case of Covid-19 has 
occurred in the country, Rio Tinto explained. The FTSE 100-listed company said work on the underground project 
continues, but progress is being slowed amid restricted access for teams from Rio Tinto, Oyu Tolgoi and its 
construction partners to oversee development and provide specialist technical services.

MARKETS
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Airlines Issue Fresh Covid-19 Warnings

UK markets were sharply lower on Monday as a series of moves by central banks around the globe were unable to 
ease investor fears of the damage being caused by Covid-19. A drastic fall in Chinese industrial production 
hammered home this point.
AJ Bell Chief Investment Officer commented: "Cutting rates to zero and unleashing another wave of quantitative 
easing may seem like a shock and awe move, but it's the playbook from a different crisis. What's needed is a 
mechanism that delivers debt forbearance until such time that the economic world starts to spin on its axis again. 
The Fed is fighting yesterday's war."
The US is pointed towards a sharp drop at Monday's open.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to address the nation on the coronavirus threat after meeting ministers and 
officials to consider measures including banning mass gatherings and lengthy household isolation for the elderly. 
Johnson will chair an emergency meeting of the Cobra committee on Monday afternoon before holding the first of 
the daily press conferences being planned to update the public on Covid-19. It comes as the Guardian reported on 
a Public Health England briefing which warned health chiefs the epidemic in the UK could last until spring next year 
and could lead up to 7.9 million people being admitted to hospital. As the UK death toll reached 35 on Sunday, 
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said over-70s could be told to stay at home for up to four months within the "coming 
weeks".
----------
Central banks across the globe revealed a host of new measures to contain the economic impact of the spread of 
Covid-19. Notably, the US Federal Reserve late Sunday made its second emergency rate cut in less than two 
weeks, lowering the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 0.00%-0.25%, where it was during the 2008 global 
financial crisis, and pledged to keep it there "until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events". 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned on Sunday that the US economy is likely to show the impact of the new 
coronavirus pandemic in the April-June period, with business and manufacturing affected. The Bank of Japan on 
Monday followed the Fed, unveiling a series of emergency monetary policy measures to shore up the world's third-
largest economy. In a meeting brought forward by two days, the BoJ said it would double its annual capacity to 
purchase exchange-traded funds and Japan real estate investment funds, the latest global central bank to take

been hit by the spread of the Covid-19 virus.

China's industrial production has contracted for the first time in three decades as the coronavirus epidemic wreaked 
havoc on the economy, official data showed. Industrial production for January and February shrank 14% in the first 
two months of the year, markedly worse than a Bloomberg poll of analysts which forecasted a 3% drop on-year. 
Retail sales plummeted 20.5% from a year ago during the same period – its worst showing in decades as well – 
after rising 8% in 2019. Analysts had expected a 4% fall. Data in the first two months is released together to 
account for regular seasonal factors during the Lunar New Year holiday. Elsewhere, House prices in China edged 
higher in February, the country's National Bureau of Statistics said, though the rate of growth slowed month-on-
month. The average prices of new homes in 70 Chinese cities rose by 5.8% year-on-year in February 2020. This 
was the slowest increase since July 2018, as the sector began to feel the impact from the spread of Covid-19. In 
January, average prices rose 6.3%.

China reported 12 more imported cases of the novel coronavirus as the capital tightened quarantine measures for 
international arrivals to prevent a new wave of infections. After declaring they had "basically" curbed the spread of 
the disease within China, where the virus first emerged, authorities are now worried about an influx of infections 
arriving from other countries. Beijing's city government has ordered international arrivals from Monday onwards to 
go into quarantine facilities for 14 days. Travellers had previously been allowed to undergo the mandatory isolation 
at home, but now only those with "special circumstances" will be exempted from the new rules, and those sent to 
the facilities must pay for their stay. Authorities have not given further detail on which travellers will be exempted 
from the new quarantine. A total of 123 cases from abroad have now been reported, with four of the 12 latest 
detected in Beijing.
----------
The coronavirus outbreak in France is "very worrying" and "deteriorating very fast", the head of the country's health 
service said. "The number of cases double every three days," Jerome Salomon said on France Inter. "I want our 
citizens to realise that there are people who are sick, who are in intensive care and that [their number] runs into 
hundreds," he said. According to the latest official figures published on Sunday, France has had 127 coronavirus 
deaths and 5,423 confirmed cases. That was a jump of 36 deaths and over 900 cases in 24 hours. More than 400 
people have been hospitalised in a serious condition. "There is a real worry that the speed of the outbreak could 
saturate hospitals and this is something we absolutely want to avoid," Salomon said, singling out the badly affected 
eastern region of Alsace near Germany and the greater Paris area.
----------
Ireland's trade surplus widened in January, driven by surging exports of electrical machinery, apparatus & 
appliances. According to the Central Statistics Office, Ireland's trade surplus stretched 32% to EUR6.39 billion from 
EUR4.86 billion in December. Exports rose 7.3% from December to EUR13.74 billion with the value of imports 
falling 7.6% to EUR7.35 billion.

(Alliance News) - Several major European airlines on Monday said they would reduce their flights by up to 90% 
amid the sharp fall in demand for air travel over the coronavirus pandemic.
Air France-KLM SA noted that "some countries have imposed constraints on the movement of travellers from 
France, the Netherlands or more broadly from Europe", affecting travel opportunities.
Air France will ground its Airbus 380 fleet, while KLM will do the same to its Boeing 747 fleet.
The airline group said it will reduce the number of available seat kilometres - a measure for passenger carrying 
capacity - by 75% to 90% in the coming two months.
Talks were also to open with employee representatives due to the "expected decline in activity".
Air France-KLM welcomed statements by the French and Dutch governments on means to support the group.
The parent company of British Airways, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, said it would reduce capacity 
in April and May by at least 75%.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said he expected demand to "remain weak until well into the summer".
"We will continue to monitor demand levels and we have the flexibility to make further cuts if necessary," Walsh 
said.
Low-cost airline easyJet PLC said it has made "further significant cancellations".
The suspension of flights "will continue on a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding 
of the majority of the easyJet fleet," the airline said.
Air France, Lufthansa And Other European Airlines Slash Flights By 90%
"European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that coordinated government backing will be required to 
ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over," said easyJet CEO Johan 
Lundgren.
Budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC also said it expected to ground most of its fleet across Europe over the next 
seven to 10 days.
"For April and May, Ryanair now expects to reduce its seat capacity by up to 80%, and a full grounding of the fleet 
cannot be ruled out," it said.
German holiday airline Condor meanwhile said that is has cancelled a number of flights to favourite tourist 
destinations to which German citizens are no longer allowed to travel.
Flights to the US, the Dominican Republic, Turkey and Morocco are affected, to varying degrees. Condor is to send 
empty planes to affected destinations in the next few days to bring back holidaymakers.
"We'll fly empty to Turkey to bring the people back home," a Condor spokeswoman said in Frankfurt, adding that 
the airline was in close cooperation with travel agents who have cancelled a large number of package holidays.
Finnish flag carrier Finnair said it will slash its capacity by 90% from April 1. As of Monday until end of March up to 
2,000 flights would be cancelled.
The airline aimed to "maintain the most critical air connections for Finland also in this exceptional situation," said 
Topi Manner, chief executive.
Scandinavian carrier SAS said Sunday it would temporarily lay off 90% of its staff, about 10,00 employees, and halt 
most of its flights.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG announced on Monday further reductions to its already stripped-back service, under which 
just one in 10 long-haul flights will now operate and one in five short- and medium-haul flights.
The German airline said it will continue running flights to bring holidaymakers back to their home country. Together 
with its Eurowings subsidiary, Lufthansa returned around 6,000 passengers with more than 20 flights at the 
weekend.
"Now it is no longer about the economic issues, but rather the responsibility which airlines carry as part of the 
critical infrastructure in their home countries," Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr says.
Meanwhile, Lufthansa Cargo says it has successfully been able to continue operating cargo flights amid the crisis 
without any change.

(Alliance News) - Trains, planes and vehicles leaving Italy faced new restrictions after the Italian government and 
nearby countries imposed drastic quarantine measures to contain the coronavirus.
The hardest-hit country in Europe said its death toll from the covid-19 virus had risen Tuesday by a third to 631, 
with the surging epidemic taking its toll on global sporting, cultural and political events.
Spain and Portugal suspended air traffic from Italy for two weeks while Austria ordered a halt to flights and trains 
from its neighbour and Slovenia said it would impose controls at its border with the country.
As British Airways - owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA - cancelled Italian flights on Tuesday, 
Air France KLM SA and low-cost carriers Ryanair Holdings PLC, Easyjet PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC said they 
would scrap flights from Italian airports until early April.
Air Canada took even more drastic measures, suspending flights to Italy until at least May 1.
However, at Rome's main Fiumicino airport there were still services running to destinations in Europe and beyond 
on Tuesday afternoon, as well domestic flights.
Flights were also still taking off from the smaller Ciampino airport, used mostly by budget airlines.
Tourists welcomed the remaining opportunities to leave.
"We have people saying they will put us on a flight back," Mina, a 58-year-old Indian national, told AFP next to 
Rome's deserted Colosseum, adding she and her family were "waiting for a call."
The ADR company which runs Rome's airports said all arriving passengers and all those heading for destinations 
outside the Schengen zone "will undergo health checks" and go through thermal scanners.
Transport In Italy Thrown Into Chaos As Tourists Search For Route Out
Australia on Wednesday said it would bar entry to foreign nationals who had been to the Mediterranean country in 
the last 14 days – measures already in place for arrivals from China and South Korea.
Mask-wearing police at Rome's main Termini train station were checking passengers' reasons for travel and making 
sure everybody kept the recommended distance of one metre away from each other.
But the departures board was showing no sign of any cancellations.
Klemen Gartner, a 22-year-old seminarian from Slovenia, said that he was trying to get back home, "somewhere I 
can understand the language".
He said that when station staff realised he wasn't Italian, he was told: "You're foreign? Go, go!" and waved through.
The rail service for Venice via Florence was only sparsely occupied but running nonetheless, with no checks for 
passengers disembarking at Florence, an AFP journalist said.
But some rail links with neighbouring countries have taken a hit.
The Thello company has cancelled its night services between Paris and Venice, as well as daytime trains between 
Milan and Marseille, until early April.
France's national train company SNCF said on Tuesday it was "waiting for advice" about how to proceed regarding 
services to Italy.
Since late February, French staff on cross-border SNCF trains have been getting off before the Italian border and 
being replaced by Italian colleagues.
Some train services between Italy and Austria were still running Tuesday but that was expected to change, a 
spokeswoman for Austrian rail operator OeBB told AFP.
A spokeswoman for Germany's Deutsche Bahn said that the only service it had linking it to Italy, between Munich 
and Venice, has been suspended.
On Italy's road links to other countries seemed more relaxed on Tuesday afternoon.
Cars crossed the border with neighbouring Slovenia in both directions, an AFP journalist reported.
Italians in the area around the city of Trieste often make the short journey into Slovenia to do their shopping and 
buy cheaper fuel.
But late Tuesday, Slovenia's government announced it would close the border, with controls put in place "as soon 
as possible", although cargo transport would not be affected.
"It is not a hermetic closure...It is a necessary move if we want to contain the virus," Slovenia's outgoing prime 
minister Marjan Sarec told reporters.
Also exempted from Austria's travel ban are cargo transporters, people with a doctor's certificate, and returning 
Austrians who agree to a two-week quarantine, the Austrian government announced.
The wave of cancelled trips is raising fears for Italy's tourism sector, which accounts for 13% of the country's gross 
domestic product.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday lowered its annual passenger targets due to the 
suspension of all flights to and from Italy. 
Dublin-based Ryanair had previously guided for passenger numbers of 154 million in its financial year ending this 
month, but this has been cut to 151 million passengers. In financial 2019, passenger numbers were 139.1 million. 
All of Ryanair's flights to and from Italy between Friday this week and April 8 have been cancelled, after the Italian 
government put the country into lock down. 
Italy has become a global epicentre for the spread of Covid-19. Over 450 people have now died in Italy. Other 
airlines have also been cancelling all of their flights to Italy. Flights from other EU countries to Italy have also been 
limited. 
Ryanair does not expect the reduced passenger guidance to affect guidance for post-tax profit. It guided in 
February for a figure of between EUR950 million and EUR1.05 billion for its soon-to-end financial year. For the 
financial year that ended March 31, 2019, Ryanair reported profit after tax of EUR1.02 billion on revenue of 
EUR7.56 billion.
"It is far too early to assess the impact of Covid-19 on financial 2021 traffic and earnings. The Ryanair group will 
continue to focus on delivering cost savings and improved operational efficiency in financial 2021. 
"Ryanair is one of the strongest airlines in the industry with EUR4 billion in cash, industry leading unit costs, 90% of 
the fleet is owned with over 70% debt free," said Ryanair. 
Shares were 6.5% higher on Tuesday afternoon in London at a price of EUR11.77 each, but they have lost 21% so 
far in 2020.

(Alliance News) - The start of the UK peak of the coronavirus epidemic is expected within the next fortnight, 
England's deputy chief medical officer has said.
Jenny Harries defended the government's decision to delay closing schools and the introduction of other stringent 
tactics, saying experts are assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a "balanced response".
But new measures – including those aimed at protecting the elderly and vulnerable – are expected shortly as cases 
rise more rapidly across the UK.
Elsewhere, the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office said US authorities are planning a flight on Tuesday to 
repatriate British nationals on the Grand Princess cruise ship at the Port of Oakland, California.
Health minister Jo Churchill said some patients can expect to wait longer for NHS treatment as doctors prioritise 
those with more serious illness and multiple underlying health conditions first.
Some air passengers have complained of being stranded in Italy after airlines including British Airways and Ryanair 
Holdings PLC cancelled flights to and from Italy. British Airways is a unit of International Consolidated Airlines SA.
The Foreign Office has confirmed it is in contact with Britons in Vietnam after reports of nine new cases confirmed 
among travellers on board the same flight from London to Hanoi on March 2, including seven British citizens.
The latest figures show that 319 people in the UK are now confirmed to have Covid-19, and five people have died in 
British hospitals.
A British man became the first UK citizen to die from coronavirus after being infected on the Diamond Princess 
cruise ship in Japan.
UPDATE: Start Of UK Coronavirus Peak Within 10 To 14 Days
Harries said the vast majority of those diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK are "pretty well" but that they may "feel 
a bit rough for a few days".
She added: "We can expect a peak in cases, it has a relatively slow take off at the start, that's where we are at the 
moment, it will start to rise quite sharply."
Asked when the rapid increase of infections might end, she said: "Within 10 to 14 days we will be likely to advise 
people with symptoms to self-isolate and we are expecting that start of the peak to come within that period."
Staying at home in self-isolation was "extremely effective in trying to move our epidemic curve forward", she added.
Harries said cancelling big outdoor events like football matches would not necessarily be a decision supported by 
science.
"The virus will not survive very long outside," she said. "Many outdoor events, particularly, are relatively safe."
Speaking on Sky News, Harries said "many thousands of people" would contract coronavirus as the disease 
continued to spread in the UK.
"We currently have relatively few cases here, which is why we are still in the containment phase," she said.
"Obviously we will have significant numbers in a way in which the country is not used to.
"This is the sort of thing that professionally we're trained for and very rarely see, almost in a professional lifetime.
"Large numbers of the population will become infected because it's a naive population – nobody has got antibodies 
to this virus currently.
"We will see many thousands of people infected by coronavirus, that's what we're seeing in other countries, and the 
important thing for us is to make sure that we manage those infections."
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said GPs would only visit sick people self-isolating in their own 
homes if absolutely necessary, due to the fact it is an infectious disease.
She added: "Generally we expect nearly all of these patients to be fine at home, and we are working to ensure, if 
they need, the few that become seriously ill, to get into hospital, there will be quick mechanisms for them to do 
that."
The comments came as Italy extended coronavirus travel restrictions to the whole country on Tuesday, with 
soldiers and police enforcing the bans.
Overall, Italy has recorded 9,172 cases of Covid-19, with 463 deaths, and figures expected to rise.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the UK amended its advice to warn against all but essential travel to Italy.
Meanwhile, the NHS has removed false Twitter accounts that have been spreading "misleading" information about 
the coronavirus outbreak.
Official NHS guidance is also to be displayed at the top of internet search results as part of measures to stop the 
spread of disinformation.
As part of a new range of features for internet platforms, the health service said it had worked with Google, Twitter 
Inc, Facebook Inc and Instagram on ways to help promote "good advice" when people were searching online. 
Google is a part of Alphabet Inc.
On Monday, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, said Britons with cold, flu or fever symptoms could soon 
to be asked to stay at home in self-isolation before too long.
UPDATE: Start Of UK Coronavirus Peak Within 10 To 14 Days
For most people, coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, but for some 
people such as the elderly or those with underlying health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including 
pneumonia.
Whitty said the balance would tip so that more and more people would suffer coronavirus rather than regular 
seasonal flu or other respiratory infections.
He added: "We are expecting the numbers to increase initially quite slowly but really quite fast after a while and we 
have to catch it before the upswing begins.
"We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10 to 14 days, when the modelling would imply we 
should move to a situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-
isolating for a period of seven days."
In other developments on how the virus is behaving, experts have said people infected with Covid-19 could go five 
days without showing any symptoms.
Researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimated the average incubation period 
of the virus to be 5.1 days.
Another study found that being older, showing signs of sepsis and having blood clots were key factors associated 
with a higher risk of death.
The research, published by The Lancet, examined 191 patients with confirmed Covid-19 at two hospitals in Wuhan 
– the epicentre of the outbreak.

March 14 to allow customers to travel if they needed.
UK-based airlines such as easyJet PLC and Ryanair Group Holdings PLC have also cancelled all flights to Italy, as 
has International Consolidated Airlines Group SA-owned British Airways.

(Alliance News) - Airlines continuing to fly between the UK and northern Italy are being urged to allow cancellations 
and rebookings.
Consumer group Which? called on carriers to ensure passengers do not lose out if they not longer want to travel.
easyJet PLC and Ryanair Group Holdings PLC are continuing to operate flights between the UK and parts of 
northern Italy locked down due to the coronavirus, and appear to be sticking to their standard terms and conditions 
in relation to non-refundable bookings.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office is advising against all but essential travel to the areas, but that does not mean 
passengers are automatically entitled to a refund on air fares.
Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: "Many passengers may feel they're now in an impossible situation – 
with the government advising them against all but essential travel to the affected areas in northern Italy, but their 
airline telling them to go ahead with their journey or face losing their money.
"Passengers with travel insurance should be covered if they cancel under these circumstances, but for those who 
are uninsured, airlines should do right by their passengers and allow greater flexibility around cancellations and 
rebooking, rather than leaving people out of pocket for heeding advice from the Foreign Office."
Ryanair will operate a severely reduced schedule to and from parts of northern Italy from Friday.
A spokesman for the airline said: "All affected passengers have received email notices today of these flight 
cancellations/changes. If passengers have not received an email, then they can expect their flights to operate as 
originally scheduled."
British Airways, owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, cancelled its flights to and from Milan and 
Venice on Monday.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline easyJet PLC is cancelling a number of flights to and from central and northern Italy 
after the country's government imposed heavy restrictions on residents in a bid to tackle the spread of coronavirus.
Around 16 million people, more than a quarter of the Italian population, are in a state of lockdown until April 3 as the 
infection rate of Covid-19 continues to rise.
Italy has registered more cases of coronavirus than any country outside China while its death toll has risen to 366.
The British authorities are advising against all but essential travel to large swathes of the country.
The UK Foreign Office advice covers the Lombardy region, including the cities of Milan, Bergamo and Como, and 
the provinces of Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini – all in the Emilia Romagna region.
Also included are Pesaro and Urbino in the Marche region; Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola and 
Vercelli in the Piemonte region; and Padova, Treviso and Venice in the Veneto region.
On Sunday evening, easyJet announced several flights to or from these destinations would be cancelled on 
Monday.
The company said in light of the lockdown in Italy, it would be reviewing its flying programme to Milan Malpensa, 
Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports from now until April 3.
"In the short-term we will be cancelling a number of flights to and from these destinations on Monday 9 March," it 
said.
It said passengers on affected flights would receive an email or text message and offered either a full refund or the 
option of changing their flights.

The airline added: "We expect to continue to reduce the number of flights in and out of Milan Malpensa, Milan 
Linate, Venice and Verona airports in the period up to April 3 and will provide a further update on our schedule in 
due course."
British Airways, a unit of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, said on Sunday it was not planning to 
ground flights.
"There are no current travel restrictions or updates for airlines flying to and from Italy," the airline said.
It said customers with flights to or from northern Italy – specifically Milan, Turin, Bologna, Venice, Bergamo and 
Verona – could rebook to a later date not beyond May 31.
BA added: "We are monitoring the situation closely and we will continue to liaise with government and global health 
authority and follow their advice."
Ryanair has also not said it is planning to cancel any routes, saying instead: "We are following guidelines issued by 
the Italian government and the World Health Organisation."
The extraordinary measures put in place across central and northern Italy include the closure of museums, cultural 
institutions and the suspension of all public gatherings and social events, including pubs, nightclubs and games 
halls.
Religious ceremonies and funerals have been suspended, and ski facilities in the affected mountain areas are 
closed.
More widely across Italy, museums, including in the Vatican, are closed and all sporting fixtures must be played 
behind closed doors.
Childcare facilities, schools and universities are closed until March 15.
The FCO said public and social gatherings in the country should be avoided with cinemas, pubs and clubs closed, 
while restaurants and bars remain open with reduced seating.

----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
BP, down 18%, Royal Dutch Shell, 'A' down 14%, Shell 'B' down 15%. The oil majors were tracking spot oil prices 
lower quoted at USD36.94 a barrel Monday morning, down from USD46.00 late Friday. Brent touched an intraday 
low of USD31.26 overnight - its lowest level since early 2016 and was the biggest percentage drop since the Gulf 
War in 1991. Saudi Arabia launched an all-out oil war Sunday with the biggest cut in its prices in the past 20 years, 
Bloomberg News reported, after OPEC and its allies failed to clinch a deal to reduce output. Last week, a meeting 
of main oil producers was expected to agree to deeper cuts to counter the impact of the coronavirus - but Moscow 
refused to tighten supply. In response, Riyadh slashed its price for April delivery by USD4 to USD6 a barrel to Asia 
and USD7 to the US.

Anglo American, down 9.3%. RBC Capital cut the miner to Outperform from Top Pick.

Informa, down 9.0%. Deutsche Bank cut the events and publishing company to Hold from Buy.

Premier Oil, down 53%. Tullow Oil, down 33%, Hunting, down 22%, Cairn Energy, down 20%, Petrofac, down 16%, 
Energean Oil & Gas, down 10%. The oil stocks were down amid the fall in oil prices."This is an oil price collapse on 
a scale not seen since the Gulf War. Unless there is a fresh agreement between the Saudis, who can manage with 
oil at this level, and Russia, which can't, we can expect the price to remain under pressure. The knock on effect on 
the UK's oil majors has been brutal this morning, with investors in full panic mode and it is hard to see sentiment 
turning in the near term," said eToro analyst Adam Vettese.

OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS

ABCAM, down 7.2%. The protein research tools producer reported double-digit revenue growth in the first half of its 
current financial year, but warned that coronavirus has hurt its performance. ABCAM reported pretax profit of 
GBP26.0 million for the six months to the end of 2019, down from GBP33.7 million reported a year ago, despite 
revenue growing by 11% to GBP138.2 million from GBP124.7 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue 
increased by 8.3%. ABCAM maintained its interim dividend at 3.55 pence per share. Looking ahead, the company 
said it is "pleased" with the progress made in the first half and remains confident in its future prospects. However, 
ABCAM warned that it has seen a reduction in revenue and impact on its supply chain since the coronavirus 
outbreak began. To date, the estimated revenue impact has been about GBP3 million, the company said, with 
around 10 days out of work across the supply chain due to site closures.

(Alliance News) - European airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC both on Tuesday reported 
solid growth in monthly passenger numbers.
Irish budget carrier Ryanair's passenger numbers rose 9% year-on-year in February, reaching 10.5 million. The 
Ryanair airline's numbers were up 8% to 10.0 million, with its Lauda division in Austria up 67% to 500,000 
passengers.
Ryanair's group load factor was 96%, with a 96% factor for Ryanair and 94% for Lauda.
On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair's group passenger numbers climbed 8% to 153.8 million with a 96% load factor. 
Geneva-based Wizz posted a 26% rise yearly in passenger numbers to 2.4 million. The load factor was 93.8%, 
down from 94.2%, with capacity up 26%. 
On a rolling 12-month basis, the Central Europe-focused carrier's passenger numbers were 20% higher at 41.0 
million. The load factor rose to 93.7% from 92.6%, with capacity up 18%.
Ryanair was 2.3% higher in early trade in London on Tuesday at EUR11.79. Wizz was up 2.7% at 3,412.00 pence. 
However, both stocks have lost around a quarter of their value since the middle of February. 
Travel stocks have come under selling pressure amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has now spread to dozens of 
countries having originated in China. The virus's spread has hit travel demand, with numerous airlines cancelling 
flights.
Ryanair on Monday said it would be reducing its short-haul programme, mainly to and from Italy, between March 17 
and April 8 amid a steep drop in bookings. Italy has become a European hotspot for the outbreak. 
Similarly, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA's British Airways cancelled over 400 flights to several short-
haul destinations in Europe on Monday.

Ryanair To Cancel Up To A Quarter Of Italian Flights Amid Coronavirus

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it is reducing its short haul flight programme - mainly to 
and from Italy -  in response to the covid-19 virus.
The Irish budget airline said it intends to cancel up to 25% of its Italian flights for a three-week period from March 17 
to April 8. 
Over the past week, Ryanair said it has seen a "significant" drop in bookings over that late March and early April 
period amid coronavirus concerns. There has also been a step up in passenger no-shows on flights, particularly 
from and within Italy, Ryanair noted. 
Looking ahead, the airline said it does not expect these cancellations to hurt its performance in its current financial 
year, ending March 31, but noted that it is too early to speculate about the impact of coronavirus outbreak on 
financial 2021. 
Ryanair said it will continue to monitor bookings carefully, and will continue to flex its schedules in response to this 
developing situation. 
"We will make sensible cuts to our schedules over the comings weeks to reflect weaker bookings, and changing 
travel patterns. All affected customers will be advised of any schedule changes at least 14 days in advance," said 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary. 
He added: "Our focus at this time is on minimising any risk to our people and our passengers."
On Friday last week, another budget airline easyJet PLC warned the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in 
"significant" softening of demand and load factors into and out of its northern Italian bases.
Ryanair To Cancel Up To A Quarter Of Italian Flights Amid Coronavirus
British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA also warned on demand due to the spread of 
coronavirus. In its annual results, IAG said it is currently experiencing demand weakness on Asian and European 
routes and a weakening of business travel across its network due to cancellation of industry events and corporate 
travel restriction.

BA Cancels Hundreds More Flights As Covid-19 Sees Demand Plummet

(Alliance News) - British Airways has cancelled more than 400 flights due to a drop in passenger numbers caused 
by Covid-19, the airline has announced.
British Airways is owned by London-listed International Consolidated Airlines SA.
Most of the cancellations are for short-haul flights between Heathrow and Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, Germany, 
Ireland and Switzerland.
It has also grounded 24 flights between Heathrow and New York's JFK airport.
A British Airways spokesman said: "To match reduced demand due to the continuing coronavirus issue, we are 
merging a number of flights between March 16 and March 28.
"We will be contacting customers on cancelled flights so we can discuss their travel options, including re-booking on 
to other carriers where possible, full refunds, or booking with BA for a later date of travel."
Airlines operating in the EU are not required to pay compensation for flight cancellations if passengers are told at 
least 14 days before they were due to travel.
British Airways told the PA news agency that pilots and cabin crew due to work on the affected flights would still be 
paid.
The airline has already suspended its flights serving mainland China and reduced the frequency of flights to 
northern Italy and Singapore.
It also announced on Monday that it has waived its fees for customers who book flights in the next two weeks, but 
later decide not to travel.
BA Cancels Hundreds More Flights As Covid-19 Sees Demand Plummet
Ryanair Holdings PLC said it is cancelling up to one in four flights on some of its routes, particularly those serving 
Italian airports.
The reduced schedule will operate from March 17 until April 8, following a "significant drop in bookings" over the 
period, according to the carrier.
The Dublin-based airline said it is taking a series of measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
These include "rolling schedule cuts", allocating leave or paid leave to pilots and cabin crew, working with suppliers 
to cut costs and freezing recruitment, promotion and pay across its network.
Ryanair insisted it is "one of the strongest airlines in the industry" but predicted that Covid-19 "will result in further 
EU airline failures over the coming weeks".
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: "This is a time for calm. We will make sensible cuts to our schedules 
over the coming weeks to reflect weaker bookings and changing travel patterns."
easyJet PLC announced last week that it was cancelling some flights because of the coronavirus.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned last month that airlines could lose USD29.3 billion this 
year due to the outbreak.
The trade association, which represents airlines, has called for regulators to relax rules on take-off and departure 
slots amid the drop in demand.
Allocation of slots at UK airports is governed by the EU, which has a so-called "use it or lose it" rule, which means 
airlines must use 80% of their slots or risk losing them.
Iata claimed it would be "inappropriate" to apply the rule in summer 2020, to allow airlines to adjust their schedules 
in response to the "extraordinary demand developments" caused by Covid-19.
In response, trade body Airports Council International Europe said the virus is "significantly impacting Europe's 
airports".
It added: "We support a partial relaxation of EU rules governing the use of airport slots use, but do not consider at 
the moment that a blanket relaxation for all air routes is justified."

EARNINGS PREVIEW: IAG Could Fare Better Than Rivals Amid Coronavirus
EARNINGS PREVIEW: IAG Could Fare Better Than Rivals Amid Coronavirus

(Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group SA could be set for marginal earnings growth in 2019, 
though focus will be on the airline's outlook as the industry bears the brunt of coronavirus.
IAG is penned to release financial results for 2019 at 0700 GMT on Friday in London. The results will be the first 
update since Chief Executive Willie Walsh announced in January he would be leaving in March.
Analysts consensus, provided by British Airways owner IAG, is for an operating results before exceptional items of 
EUR3.27 billion. In 2018, the figure was EUR3.23 billion, meaning the market expects growth of 1.2%.
IAG's latest update came in December, showing a 4.7% rise in passenger numbers for 2019 to 118.3 million. Traffic 
in the year was 5.6% higher, while capacity rose 4.0%. 
The load factor, a measurement of how many seats are filled, improved to 84.6% from 83.3%. 
In focus, however, will be IAG's response to coronavirus, which originated in China but has now spread to Europe 
and other parts of the world. 
BA has cancelled dozens of flights serving Milan due to a drop in demand amid the coronavirus outbreak. This 
follows, in late January, a decision to cancel all flights to China. 
The International Air Transport Association warned last week airlines could lose USD29.3 billion in 2020 due to the 
outbreak.
IAG's shares were 11% lower on Thursday in London at 499.40 pence each, and they have lost 20% this week, 
with markets sliding as fears over the virus's impact surge. The share prices of London-listed rivals such as easyJet 
and Ryanair have similar plummeted, as fears over coronavirus hit travel demand. 
Earlier in February, peer Air France KLM warned coronavirus has so far had a EUR150 million to EUR200 million 
impact due to flight cancellations and weaker demand to Asia.
EARNINGS PREVIEW: IAG Could Fare Better Than Rivals Amid Coronavirus
Alexander Paterson at Peel Hunt believes IAG will issue similar guidance. 
However, analysts at Credit Suisse believes IAG is less exposed than some rivals to slowdowns in demand in 
Europe, specifically Italy, and Asia. Italy is so far the European hotspot for the virus. 
Citigroup analysts said IAG "has been quoted" as seeing "marginal" impact from coronavirus, and the bank believes 
the company will be one of the main beneficiaries of a fuel tailwind due to falling oil prices. 
The fuel tailwind, Citigroup continued, is "monumental" and should mitigate some of the coronavirus impact. 
However, Citigroup does see IAG's dividend falling to EUR0.29 for 2019, compared to EUR0.66 in 2018. However, 
that 2018 figure includes a EUR0.35 special dividend, without which the payout was EUR0.31. 
Jarrod Castle at UBS said IAG's near-term outlook is to be the main focus. He sees annual revenue rising by 5.1% 
to EUR25.65 billion.

(Alliance News) - Despite opening higher on Tuesday, London stocks quickly slipped back into the red to extend the 
previous session's losses as fears remained heightened over the spread of coronavirus.
The FTSE 100 index was down 38.09 points, or 0.5%, at 7,118.74 on Tuesday at midday. The blue-chip index had 
closed down 3.3% on Monday.
The FTSE 250 was down 129.54 points, or 0.6%, at 20,988.33, and the AIM All-Share was down 0.4% at 939.29.
The Cboe UK 100 index was off 0.4% at 12,057.94. The Cboe UK 250 was down 0.8% at 18,900.64 and the Cboe 
UK Small Companies down 0.5% at 12,324.94.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.9% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt down 0.8%.
"The coronavirus came back to bite investors yesterday, with the incredible 1,000-point decline in the Dow providing 
an insight into just how bad it could get if this virus is not contained. Stock markets are heading lower once again 
this morning, despite early attempts to bounce back," said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG.
"What was largely a Chinese issue to resolve has soon become an international problem, with European eyes 
transfixed on Italian efforts to curb the spread of the virus," said Mahony. "Fears over a potential coronavirus 
contagion throughout Europe is likely to provide substantial risk-off sentiment for days and weeks to come, with 
significant pressure on the Italians to stop this outbreak from spreading throughout the continent."
China reported 508 new cases and another 71 deaths on Tuesday, 68 of them in the central city of Wuhan, where 
the epidemic was first detected in December.
The updates bring mainland China's totals to 77,658 cases and 2,663 deaths, while South Korea now has the 
second highest number of cases in the world with 893 and eight deaths.
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Stocks Slide Into Red As Virus Fears Dominate
In Italy, where 229 people have tested positive for the virus and 7 have died, police have manned checkpoints 
around a dozen quarantined northern towns.
In the US on Tuesday, stocks are pointed to a slightly higher start with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seen up 
0.1%, the S&P 500 called flat and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.1%.
Travel stocks in London continued to fall amid worries over demand amid the spread of coronavirus. Travel 
operator TUI was down 3.1% and cruise operator Carnival down 2.9%. Airlines easyJet and Ryanair were down 
2.8% and 1.4% respectively.
Elsewhere in the FTSE 100, Meggitt slumped 5.1%. The aerospace parts maker warned of a difficult 2020 due to 
the continued grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and the coronavirus outbreak.
Meggitt reported revenue of GBP2.28 billion in 2019, up 9.6% from GBP2.08 billion in 2018, lifting pretax profit 33% 
to GBP286.7 million from GBP216.1 million. 
Looking ahead, Meggitt said "sector specific factors" including the production halt of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX 
and supply chain disruption, as well as the "wider macroeconomic impact" of coronavirus are expected to hold back 
margin progression in the short-term. Meggitt expects 2020 organic revenue growth in a range of 2% to 4% and 
2020 underlying operating margin improved by 30 to 50 basis points.
Croda International was down 3.8% after the speciality chemicals company reported a dip in profit for 2019.
In 2019, the Yorkshire-based company recorded pretax profit of GBP302.3 million, down 4.9% on the GBP317.9 
million seen in 2018. Revenue was marginally lower year-on-year at GBP1.38 billion from GBP1.39 billion the year 
before. 
Croda declared a total ordinary dividend of 90.00 pence in 2019, up 3.4% in the 87.00p distributed in 2018. The 
company did, however, declare a 115p special dividend in 2018. 
Among the blue-chip risers, Prudential was up 2.0% after the insurer said it was willing to facilitate a positive 
dialogue with activist shareholder Third Point.
The US hedge fund sent a letter to Prudential on Monday saying it had acquired a stake of just under 5%. 
Dan Loeb's New York-based fund wrote to Prudential's board calling on the 332-year old insurer to split its existing 
US and Asian operations and list them as separate entities, saying there was "no strategic rationale" for the 
company to be listed in London, following its demerger of UK unit M&G last year. 
In the FTSE 250, SIG slumped 15% after the building products firm said Chief Executive Meinie Oldersma and 
Chief Financial Officer Nick Maddock have both resigned with immediate effect.
SIG said Steve Francis will become CEO, also with immediate effect, on an initial contract until the end of 2020. 
Francis had been appointed CEO of Patisserie Valerie-owner Patisserie Holdings at the end of 2018 amid an 
accounting scandal that sent the former CEO packing and soon thereafter the company into administration.
"Steve has had a wide-ranging CEO, CFO and management consulting career. He is a strong leader with a proven 
track record of returning radically restructured businesses back to growth," said SIG.
Kath Kearney-Croft - who joined SIG in January - was appointed as interim CFO with immediate effect. He was 
initially hired to provide support to the executive team during Oldersma's leave of absence. 
To come in the economic calendar on Tuesday is US consumer confidence at 1500 GMT.

Bunzl, up 2.5%. The distribution firm said its revenue edged higher in 2019, despite "mixed macroeconomic and 
market conditions". For 2019, revenue rose 2.7% to GBP9.33 billion from GBP9.08 billion in 2018, helping pretax 
profit increase by 6.7% to GBP453.3 million from GBP424.8 million. By segment, only a 1.7% revenue decline to 
GBP1.24 billion in the UK & Ireland prevented growth across the board. In North America, revenue climbed 3.7% to

easyJet, down 13%, TUI down 9.0%, International Consolidated Airlines Group down 8.5%. The airline stocks were

to 30 countries across the world. "Airlines, car makers and luxury goods stocks were among the big fallers on both 
European and UK markets. TUI, easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines were among the biggest fallers on 
the London Stock Exchange, perhaps implying that investors are fearful that consumers and business people may

Fresnillo, up 3.8%. The Mexican gold miner said it has accelerated the development of the Juanicipio project in 
Mexico's Zacatecas state and now expects to start producing silver and gold in mid-2020, ahead of schedule. 
Fresnillo said construction is well underway, engineering is complete, and all major process equipment has been 
purchased and received on site. It added that the mine's pre-operative capital expenditure has increased by 11% to 
USD440 million from its estimate of USD395 million back in January 2018. The mine is now expected to reach 85% 
name plate capacity in the fourth quarter of 2021, and 90% to 95% in 2022. Fresnillo expects a total average annual

respectively. This represents a 24% revenue growth year-on-year, but a 17% decline in Ebitda. LoopUp said the 
macro headwinds were hurting UK user behaviour in the first half of 2019, but have stabilised since the summer. 
However, the company said it is now experiencing a similar effect in its US business. The AIM-listed company said 
decline in US minutes per active user worsened in the second half of 2019 to 8% after falling just by 2% year-on-
year in the first half.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened sharply lower on Monday with travel stocks weighing on the FTSE 
100, following a surge in coronavirus infections around the globe. 
The FTSE 100 index was down 160.03 points, or 2.2%, at 7,243.89. The FTSE 250 was down 401.37 points, or 
1.9% at 21,378.83, and the AIM All-Share was down 10.03 points, or 1.0% at 962.59.
The Cboe UK 100 index was down 2.0% at 12,270.20. The Cboe UK 250 was down 1.6% at 19,343.66, and the 
Cboe UK Small Companies was down 0.1% at 12,549.40.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 2.7% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt down 2.5%.
Investors are becoming more concerned the virus outbreak could have a much longer-term impact on the world 
economy and company earnings as it spreads further outside China.
The COVID-19 disease has killed nearly 2,600 people and infected 80,000. Investors had been optimistic the 
outbreak was being contained outside China; however a spike in infections and deaths in other countries including 
South Korea, Italy and Iran have prompted fears of a pandemic.
The coronavirus epidemic could put an already fragile global economic recovery at risk, the IMF warned Sunday, as 
G20 financial chiefs voiced "real concern" over its economic ripple effects.
Global growth was poised for a modest rebound to 3.3% in 2020, up from 2.9% last year, International Monetary 
Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said after a two-day meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors 
in Riyadh.
Georgieva told the Riyadh gathering that the outbreak would shave about 0.1 of a percentage point from global 
growth and constrain China's growth to 5.6% this year, in a baseline scenario.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Travel Stocks Sink Amid Coronavirus Global Spread
On the London Stock Exchange, Russian gold miner Polymetal International was among a handful of blue chip 
risers, up 3.5% tracking spot gold prices higher.
Gold was quoted at USD1,675.26 an ounce Monday morning, up sharply from USD1,643.10 late Friday, as demand 
for the safe-haven asset increased amid the coronavirus concerns.
At the other end of the large cap index airline stocks were among the worst performers amid fears of weakening 
demand for travel as the spread of the coronavirus widened to 30 countries across the world - a situation the World 
Health Organization is calling "worrisome."
easyJet was the worst blue chip performer, down 11%, TUI was down 9.0% and British Airways parent International 
Consolidated Airlines Group down 8.5%. Elsewhere, Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was down 8.9%. 
Last week, the International Air Transport Association announced that its initial assessment of the impact of the 
coronavirus outbreak showed a potential 13% full-year loss of passenger demand for carriers in the Asia-Pacific 
region.
IATA's initial assessment of the impact of COVID-19 outbreak said that lost revenue for 2020 could amount to 
USD29.3 billion, and result in a 4.7% hit to global demand.
"The estimated impact of the COVID-19 outbreak also assumes that the center of the public health emergency

would be larger," IATA said last week.

The UK is preparing to detail its demands for a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Ministers are expected to 
recommit to seeking to obtain a Canada-style agreement in the negotiating mandate scheduled for publication on

However, this could set up a clash with the EU after its chief negotiator Michel Barnier ruled out the possibility the 
UK can have the same deal as the North American nation. The government is expected to publish its negotiating 
mandate for a desired free trade agreement with the US the following week.

(Alliance News) - Stocks in Europe plunged across the board on Monday with travel stocks in London hammered as 
fears over the spread of coronavirus ratcheted following a surge in cases in South Korea and Italy.
The FTSE 100 index closed down 247.09 points, or 3.3%, at 7,156.83. 
The FTSE 250 ended down 662.33 points, or 3.0%, at 21,117.87, and the AIM All-Share closed down 29.68 points, 
or 3.1%, at 942.94.
The Cboe UK 100 ended down 3.4% at 12,107.10, the Cboe UK 250 closed down 3.2% at 19,047.35, and the Cboe 
Small Companies ended 1.5% lower at 12,380.39.
In Europe the CAC 40 in Paris ended down 3.9% while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt slumped 4.0%. In Milan, the FTSE 
MIB plummeted 5.4%.
"Coronavirus concerns have hit markets hard today, with a more global reach raising fears that the virus cannot be 
contained as easily as many had presumed," said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG.
"A rising number of cases in Italy, Iran, and South Korea highlight the international nature of this virus, with many 
fearing that we are passing the point at which it can be contained. Most worryingly, the ongoing search for the 
'patient zero' that brought the virus to [Italy] means we could see cases ramp up and spread rapidly," said Mahony.
The World Health Organization warned countries on Monday to be ready for a "potential pandemic" as new deaths 
and infections in Europe, the Middle East and Asia triggered more drastic efforts to contain the new coronavirus.
The number of fatalities in China – where the virus emerged late last year – also continued to soar, with 150 more 
deaths taking the official toll to nearly 2,600.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: FTSE Flops As Virus Fears Pummel Travel Stocks
And more worryingly, the spread of the virus in other parts of the world has accelerated over the past week, with 
Iran, South Korea and Italy emerging as new hotspots. Deaths were reported in each of those countries on Monday, 
while Afghanistan, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman also announced their first cases of the virus.
Stocks in New York were deep in the red at the London equities close, with the DJIA down 2.8%, the S&P 500 
index also down 2.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 3.4%. 
Travel stocks were the worst performers in London as investors fear the spread of the virus will knock travel 
demand.
easyJet shares closed down 16%, Ryanair down 13%, TUI down 10%, and International Consolidated Airlines, 
which operates British Airways, sank 9.0%.
The only two stocks in the FTSE 100 to gain on Monday were Pearson, up 2.6%, and Bunzl, up 2.4%.
Bunzl said revenue for 2019 rose 2.7% yearly to GBP9.33 billion, helping pretax profit increase by 6.7% to 
GBP453.3 million. By segment, only a 1.7% revenue decline to GBP1.24 billion in the UK & Ireland prevented 
growth across the board.
In North America, revenue climbed 3.7% to GBP5.47 billion and in Continental Europe by 1.8% to GBP1.83 billion. 
In the Rest of the World, revenue rose by 5.6% to GBP781.6 million.
Associated British Foods posted modest losses, closing down 1.9%. The ingredients and clothing retailer expects 
progress in half-year results, helped by a sales rise at its Primark retail arm, which is yet to experience any short-
term pain from the coronavirus outbreak.
AB Foods said it built inventories before the Chinese new year, when the virus initially spread through Wuhan. The 
risk of supply shortages could be prevalent towards the end of the financial year however, AB Foods cautioned, if 
delays to factory production continue.
The company, which ends its first half on February 29, expects growth in sales and adjusted operating profit to rise 
from GBP639 million in the year prior. However, on a reported basis, the dilutive effect of the adoption of accounting 
standard IFRS 16 on earnings will result in a "small reduction in adjusted earnings per share in the first half".
At Primark, first half sales are tipped to come in 2.5% higher year-on-year, and up 4.2% at constant currency. Like-
for-like sales are flat, the company said. 
In the FTSE 250, which was also painted red, marketing and media firm Ascential was one of the few winners, up 
3.8%.
For 2019, Ascential recorded pretax profit of GBP10.2 million, a 65% drop year-on-year. Revenue rose 19% to 
GBP416.2 million. 
Sales revenue jumped 31% to GBP158.4 million, while Marketing revenue added 17% to GBP135.9 million. Product 
Design revenue was 11% higher at GBP86.5 million.
Looking towards 2020, Ascential is targetting organic revenue growth, through its Money20/20 platform and billings 
growth in its Edge e-commerce business.
In commodities, Brent oil was quoted at USD55.65 a barrel at the London equities close Monday, down from 
USD57.80 late Friday.
"Of course, the spread of the virus is impacting every major market, but oil has seen one of the strongest reactions. 
Crude benchmarks in both the US and UK are trading down by over minus 4% so far today. Focusing on Brent 
crude, prices fell roughly 25% peak-to-trough in a month from early January to early February, and after staging a 
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: FTSE Flops As Virus Fears Pummel Travel Stocks
fierce recovery rally over the last two weeks, Brent is starting to look like its ready to begin another leg lower," said 
Matt Weller, head of market research at FOREX.com.
Gold, however, was quoted at USD1,671.11 an ounce at the London equities close against USD1,643.10 as 
investors flocked to the safe haven asset.
The safe haven yen was also higher on Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY110.56, lower 
compared to JPY111.72 late Friday.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2928 at the London equities close, compared to USD1.2970 at the close Friday. 
The euro stood at USD1.0862, against USD1.0863.
In the economic calendar for Tuesday, there is German GDP at 0700 GMT and US consumer confidence at 1500 
GMT.
In Tuesday's UK corporate calendar, there are annual results from specialty chemicals firm Croda International, 
aerospace and defence firm Meggitt, and retail property investor Hammerson.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC chief Michael O'Leary has said that Boeing Co aircraft will be the "safest, 
most checked planes" once the manufacturer overcomes its issues with its 737 MAX models following two deadly 
crashes.
Speaking to the Times, the Irish businessman criticized the US manufacturer for doing a "seriously bad job of 
explaining their new planes," but also cast a vote of confidence in the company's new aircraft.
"People will love the plane when it's back, but we have a customer confidence issue," the budget airline boss told 
the newspaper in an interview published on Saturday.
"We will deal with that by hopefully having lower fares onboard the plane while trying it out.
"And if someone decides they don't want to fly for a period of time we will say, 'Fine, you can offload yourself and 
we will refund you.' That's how much confidence we have in the plane," the famously refund-averse O'Leary said.
The Irish budget airline did not cancel a contract with Boeing to order up to 210 of its 737s, including MAX models, 
despite the US company's grounding of the 737 MAX series last March after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia 
killed 346 people.
The primary cause of the crashes in October 2018 and March 2019 is thought to be a fault in the flight control 
software, which Boeing had wanted to fix with an update more than a year ago.
In the most recent setback for Boeing, whose grounded 737 MAX airliners created a backlog in orders, foreign 
object debris was found in fuel tanks of some of the aircraft during maintenance work, the aviation giant said on 
Tuesday.
O'Leary faced criticism for claiming in the Times interview that terrorists "will generally be males of a Muslim 
persuasion".
PRESS: Ryanair Boss Still Confident In Boeing ; Muslim Remark Backlash
The airline boss has been accused of making "racist and discriminatory" remarks, PA reported.
The Muslim Council of Britain said the comments amounted to discrimination against Muslim passengers, while 
hate-crime monitoring group, Tell Mama suggested his "flippant" words could end up having serious consequences 
for the business.
The 58-year-old told the Times that families with young children should be waved through airport security because 
there was "virtually" zero chance of them being bombers.
O'Leary also criticised UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the decision to rescue Flybe, with the 58-year-old 
questioning why taxpayers were left to foot the bill for a company owned by three of the industry's richest 
billionaires.
Flybe is owned by Connect Airways, a consortium made up of Cyrus Capital Partners, Stobart Group and Richard 
Branson's Virgin Atlantic – which itself is half-owned by US giant Delta Airlines.
"If Branson and Delta won't put their hands in their pockets, why should the taxpayer?" O'Leary told The Times.
O'Leary said he believes the aviation industry has been treated unfairly over environmental issues and pointed out 
Ryanair is spending GBP25 billion over the next eight years to make its fleet greener.

(Alliance News) - UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak could abandon a controversial overhaul of air 
passenger duty agreed as part of a rescue deal for Flybe, putting the regional airline's future into jeopardy, the 
Telegraph reported late Monday.
The new chancellor is against a cut to the tax, the newspaper said, citing "industry sources". His predecessor, Sajid 
Javid, had backed a reduction in the tax to help keep Flybe afloat.
According to the Telegraph, one source said: "The change of chancellor will make it significantly less likely to 
happen. The message was: 'Don't bank on it happening.'"
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/02/17/ministers-could-backtrack-crucial-flybe-tax-cut/
Back in January, Flybe struck a deal with the UK government for a reprieve of air passenger duty to stave off 
collapse. 
Flybe is owned by Connect Airways, a joint venture among Stobart Group Ltd, Virgin Atlantic and investment 
adviser Cyrus Capital Partners. It said at the time that the reprieve from HMRC "will only last a matter of months, 
before all taxes and duties are paid in full". 
"A payment plan was agreed with HMRC for a debt of less than GBP10 million. This is a standard time to pay 
arrangement with HMRC that any business in financial difficulties may use," Flybe said last month.
However, the arrangement has drawn the ire of competitors, including British Airways-owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group SA and Ryanair Holdings PLC. Both have written to the UK government asking for 
more information about the deal that was struck with Flybe and asking for the tax reprieve to be extended to all air 
carriers.
Stobart shares were up 0.8% at 92.20 pence in London on Tuesday morning.

(Alliance News) - Storm Dennis is causing a second weekend of disruption with bad weather wreaking havoc 
across the UK.
Heavy rain and strong winds have struck the country, and the Ministry of Defence has deployed British Army 
personnel to assist people in West Yorkshire, which was badly hit by flooding during last weekend's Storm Ciara.
Flights have been grounded for safety reasons, with International Consolidated Airlines Group SA's British Airways 
and easyJet PLC confirming cancellations.
More than 230 easyJet flights in and out of the UK on Saturday have been cancelled, while several sporting fixtures 
were also called off due to the weather.
The US National Weather Service's Ocean Prediction Centre reported winds up to 92 mph and waves that could 
reach over 100 feet high across the North Atlantic early on Saturday.
Forecasters were expecting winds to reach 70mph along coastlines while some parts of the country could witness 
up to 4.7in of rain.
Experts have warned that conditions amount to a "perfect storm", with hundreds of homes at risk of flooding.
The Met Office has issued eight weather warnings covering most of the UK this weekend.
This includes amber warnings from midday on Saturday over southern Scotland, northern England, Wales and part 
of the South West saying that flooding could cause a danger to life.
A spokesman for British Airways said they are "merging a small number of Heathrow short-haul flights to the same 
destination and using larger aircraft where possible to minimise disruption", while a spokeswoman for easyJet 
confirmed 234 cancellations.
Flights Grounded As UK Battered By Storm For Second Weekend In A Row
Ryanair Holdings PLC said all its flights are operating as normal.
A spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport said: "To minimise the number of flights cancelled at short notice we have 
taken the joint decision, alongside our airline and air traffic partners, to pre-emptively consolidate today's schedule."
A spokesman for Luton Airport said the airport is "fully operational", but added that "a number of cancellations" are 
expected later on Saturday.
The MoD said 75 personnel from 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, will be aiding the Environment Agency 
in constructing barriers and repairing flood defences in Ilkley and Calderdale, while 70 Reservists from 4th 
Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, have also been tasked with providing support where required.
Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: "Our Armed Forces are always ready to support local authorities and 
communities whenever they need it. The rapid response of the Army today will help with provision of flood relief to 
local communities in West Yorkshire."
The EA said flooding is likely to be worse than under last weekend's Storm Ciara due to rain falling on already 
saturated ground.
In England alone, 800 properties were left flooded when Storm Ciara struck, the EA said.
North Wales Police said very high winds had led to debris and branches falling off trees and Cornwall Fire and 
Rescue Service said it had rescued a motorist from a car stuck in flood water in the Liskeard area.
Elsewhere, a Royal Navy warship has been dispatched to help in an urgent search for a man in the sea off the Kent 
coast.
Lifeboats and the coastguard helicopter are scouring the sea near Margate Harbour after reports of a man 
overboard, HM Coastguard said.
Power cuts are also expected and there is a good chance that train and buses will see cancellations or delays and 
roads closed.
The Met Office said the "main areas of concern" on Saturday are north and south-west England and Wales, with the 
South East bearing the brunt more on Sunday.
At just after 1pm on Saturday, there were 17 flood warnings – meaning flooding is "expected" – and 179 flood alerts 
– meaning flooding is possible – in places across the country.
Flood defences are due to be in operation this weekend, with additional temporary flood barriers being installed in 
Shropshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Surrey.
More than 500 staff are on active incident duty and 30 mobile pumps have been deployed, the EA said.
Network Rail has advised passengers to expect disruption on many routes due to flooding and to allow more time 
for their journeys.
Meanwhile, people living near the railway are being urged to secure any loose items in their gardens, after several 
trampolines were blown on to tracks and overhead electric wires last weekend, blocking lines.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC's chief commercial officer told reporters in Milan that the budget airline is 
not interested in buying Air Italy, Reuters reported on Thursday. 
Struggling Air Italy, part-owned by Qatar Airways, announced its bankruptcy Tuesday but said it would guarantee 
flights through February 25, after which tickets would be reimbursed.
Ryanair's Chief Commercial Officer David O'Brien told reporters that "we have no interest whatsoever in buying Air 
Italy. It would be pointless", Reuters reported.

Media reports earlier this week linked the low-cost airline with a potential rescue bid for Air Italy. 
The company, formerly called Meridiana, on Tuesday said: "From February 11 to 25 inclusive, all Air Italy flights will 
be guaranteed by other companies at the planned times and days."
Italy's flag carrier is Societa Aerea Italiana, trading as Alitalia. 
Ryanair shares were 0.8% lower at EUR15.63 each in London on Thursday afternoon.

(Alliance News) - The government has refused to provide any details on its agreement and ongoing negotiations 
with struggling airline Flybe, in response to formal questions posed by British Airways' owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group SA.
A Freedom of Information request by IAG for details from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial 
Strategy, seen by the PA news agency, asked ministers whether the government is a "financial guarantor" to Flybe.
Bosses also asked for details on a tax deferral on passenger duty, which has been confirmed by Flybe but not by 
the government.
But officials declined to answer any of the seven questions asked by IAG, stating to do so would "be likely to 
prejudice Her Majesty's Government's commercial interests".
The BEIS department confirmed the government does not own a stake in Flybe.
In its response to IAG, the department added that the information has been withheld because it could "prejudice" 
future relationships making them "less likely to share intelligence in the future relationship with key stakeholders in 
the external market".
IAG and Ryanair Holdings PLC have both been highly critical of the government's involvement in helping Flybe 
avoid collapse earlier this year.
The British Airways owner accused ministers at the time of a "lack of transparency about the government's 
involvement in the rescue package for Flybe".
One question, on Air Passenger Duty, asked whether the government had altered the timing or amount due to be 
paid by Flybe. The government declined to answer.

Ministers were also asked if they have ensured Flybe's owners – Stobart Group Ltd, Virgin Atlantic and Cyrus 
Capital – have met their previous funding commitments to invest GBP100 million in the airline when they bought it 
last year. Again, no answer was given.
Stobart has since said it will invest up to an extra GBP9 million. Virgin and Cyrus have confirmed they will invest but 
have declined to say how much.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened higher on Tuesday as the FTSE 100 rose back above the 7,500 
mark, with travel stocks among the best performers after TUI raised annual earnings guidance. 
The FTSE 100 index was up 54.80 points, or 0.7%, at 7,501.68. The mid-cap FTSE 250 was up 114.77 points, 
0.6%, at 21,608.09, and the AIM All-Share was up 3.49 points, or 0.4% at 965.02.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 0.7% at 12,705.20. The Cboe UK 250 was up 0.3% at 19,437.66, and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies was down 0.1% at 12,385.40.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.6% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up 0.9%.
In the FTSE 100, TUI was the standout performer, up 11% after the Anglo-German tour operator said strong travel 
demand, particularly from the UK, will help it offset cost pressures from the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX.
For the three months to December 31, the company's underlying loss before interest and tax widened 77% to 
EUR146.9 million from EUR83.1 million the year prior. This was despite revenue rising 7.7% to EUR3.85 billion 
from EUR3.57 billion the year before.
TUI said it saw the "best booking volumes month in the company's history" during the three months to December - 
following the collapse of rival Thomas Cook in September last year.
TUI is predicting high single-digit percentage growth in financial 2020 revenue, versus previous mid-to-high single 
digit percentage growth guidance, due to currently strong trading trends in its Markets & Airlines business.
Annual EBIT is now expected to be between EUR850 million to EUR1.05 billion versus previous EUR950 million to 
EUR1.05 billion guidance range. The tweak in annual EBIT estimate was attributed by TUI to Boeing's intention to 
return 737 MAX to service by mid-2020 as compared with previous April return to service estimate.

"Overall, we see this as an encouraging statement. Booking trends across the group are favourable, especially in 
the UK, whilst progress continues to be made in across its higher value Cruise and Hotel divisions," said Shore 
Capital analyst Greg Johnson. 
Fellow blue-chip travel stocks, easyJet and British Airways-owner International Consolidated Airlines Group were 
up 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively. Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was up 2.1%. 
United Utilities was up 3.0% after Jefferies double upgraded the water works to Buy from Underperform. 
Ocado Group was up 1.2%, despite reporting a widened loss for financial 2019. The online grocer said its pretax 
loss widened in the 52 weeks ended December 1 to GBP214.5 million from GBP44.4 million a year prior due to an 
increase in operating expenses.
More positively, Ocado reported revenue growth of 9.9% during the year to GBP1.76 billion from GBP1.60 billion a 
year earlier, driven by an increase in the average number of orders per week. 
Looking ahead, Ocado said it expects revenue growth of 10% to 15% in its current financial year, with operating 
margins improving. The company said it also expects to recover insurance proceeds related to Andover fire "over 
time". 
In the FTSE 250, William Hill was the best performer, up 4.5% after the bookmaker announced a strategic 
partnership with New York-based CBS Sports, to provide official sports book and wagering data across all CBS 
Sports platforms and CBS television programming. 
The high street bookmaker said the partnership will begin with initial integrations in March on the CBS Sports digital 
platforms, with a full rollout planned for the fantasy football season. William Hill said it will receive exclusive rights to 
promote its brand across CBS Sports digital properties, including through CBS Sports Fantasy. Financial terms of 
the deal were not disclosed.
In China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.4%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed up 1.4%. 
Financial markets in Japan were closed for a public holiday.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.2900 Tuesday morning, lower than USD1.2922 at the London equities close on 
Monday.
Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will address the Lords Economic Affairs Committee at 1535 GMT 
on Tuesday.
The euro traded at USD1.0909 early Tuesday, lower than USD1.0920 late Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was 
quoted at JPY109.91, up from JPY109.76.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will be speaking at 1400 GMT on Tuesday.
"ECB President Lagarde and BoE Governor Carney also speak today. Lagarde will probably have to acknowledge 
recent poor Eurozone data when she addresses the European Parliament, which may cause her to again call for 
more fiscal stimulus. Carney will not be governor by the next BoE policy meeting but markets will still be interested 
in his comments," noted analysts at Lloyds. 
Gold was quoted at USD1,566.20 an ounce Tuesday, lower than USD1,574.80 late Monday.
Brent was trading at USD53.78 a barrel Tuesday, firm against USD53.58 late Monday.
The economic events calendar on Tuesday has UK GDP and industrial and manufacturing data at 0930 GMT.

In addition, investor attention will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's take on the coronavirus fallout and 
the health of the US economy. The Fed chief will deliver his semi-annual testimony to Congress, appearing before 
the House financial services committee on Capitol Hill starting at 1500 GMT.

Ocado said it expects revenue growth of 10% to 15% in its current financial year, with operating margins 
improvement. "The Solutions business continues to attract major players from far and wide, but crucially this pace 
of expansion needs to be maintained for the current share price level to be justified. The size and breadth of 
Ocado's expansion hitherto provides a constant stream of execution risk, while the lack of a dividend in the 
foreseeable future defines the stock as a pure growth play," said Interactive Investor's Richard Hunter.

quarter it had encountered a number of challenges. Nakama said coronavirus hurt its revenue in both Hong Kong 
and Singapore, as local firms are choosing to delay the start dates of new hires until the full impact of the virus has 
been determined. Despite this challenge, the Asia region as a whole remains highly attractive, Nakama said, and it 
expects that the future growth of the business will be focussed on developing its reach there. Turning to the UK, 
Nakama said the region remains "challenging" following the changes to IR35, as some clients are potentially 
looking to move payrolled contractors directly on to their payrolls, thus reducing Nakama's monthly revenue stream.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said traffic for the first month of 2020 rose, also reporting 
growth from its Austrian subsidiary Lauda.
The Irish budget airline said its total traffic for January was 10.8 million passengers, representing a 5% increase 
from 10.3 million in January 2019.
The figures included a 67% rise in Lauda passengers to 500,000 from 300,000, with a 91% load factor. Traffic from 
the core Ryanair business increased by 3.0% to 10.3 million from 10.0 million, with a 92% load factor.
The airline's group load factor for January came in at 92%, up from 91% in the same month in 2019 but below its 
rolling annual figure of 96%. 
On a rolling annual basis, total traffic was up 8.0% at 152.9 million versus 141.1 million year on year.
Ryanair operated more than 62,000 scheduled flights in January, it said.
On Monday, Ryanair had said it swung to a third-quarter operating profit of EUR91.3 million, compared to a loss of 
EUR68.0 million for the same period a year before.
The stock was trading 0.2% lower at EUR15.82 each on Tuesday morning in London.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a profit in the third quarter, compared to a loss the 
year before, on better-than-expected Christmas and New Year bookings.
In the three months to December 31 - traditionally a weak season for airlines - the budget airline recorded operating 
profit of EUR91.3 million, compared to a loss of EUR68.0 million for the same period a year before.
Total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 21% year on year to EUR1.91 billion from EUR1.58 billion. 
Traffic rose 6.2% to 35.9 million, while revenue per passenger grew 13%.
Load factor was up to 96% from 95%.
"Better than expected Christmas and New Year bookings, at higher fares, led to a 16% increase in scheduled 
revenue as we carried 36 million guests at 9% higher fares. Ancillary revenue increased by 28% to EUR720 million 
as more guests choose Priority Boarding and Preferred Seat services," the airline said. 
Total operating expenses grew 9.7% to EUR1.81 billion from EUR1.65 billion.
Ryanair said: "Our fuel bill rose 14% to EUR700 million due to higher prices and 6% traffic growth. Ex-fuel unit 
costs rose by 1% due to higher staff (increased pilot pay, higher crew ratios as pilot resignations have slowed to 
almost zero) and maintenance costs (older aircraft longer in the fleet due to the Boeing MAX delivery delays), offset 
by falling EU261 costs due to improved punctuality."
The company's fuel is 90% hedged for financial 2020 at USD71 per barrel and 90% of its financial 2021 fuel is 
hedged at USD61 per barrel, which, Ryanair said, should save the airline about USD100 million.
"We continue to negotiate attractive growth deals as airports compete to win Ryanair's very limited traffic growth," 
the company added.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Third Quarter Boosted By Strong Christmas Bookings
Turning to the ongoing Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery delays, Ryanair said it is now likely the first delivery will be 
September or October 2020.
The requirement for MAX simulator training also will slow down the delivery of backlogged aircraft and new 
deliveries, Ryanair added.
The airline continued: "But we believe that these 'gamechanger' aircraft (with 4% more seats, burn 16% less fuel), 
when delivered, will transform our cost base and our business for the next decade. Due to these delivery delays, we 
won't see any of these cost savings until late financial 2021." 
As a result , Ryanair is extending its 200 million yearly passenger target by "at least" one or two year to financial 
2025 or financial 2026.
Looking towards financial 2020, Ryanair is guiding for profit after tax between EUR950 million and EUR1.05 billion, 
based on strong Christmas and New Year travel bookings.
For the financial year that ended March 31, 2019, Ryanair reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million on group 
revenue of EUR7.69 billion.
Fourth-quarter bookings are up 1% on the year before, the airline said, with "slightly better" than expected average 
fares. Ryanair expects full-year traffic to grow by 8% to 154 million passengers, with revenue guided 3% to 4% 
higher.
The airline also expects its fuel bill to rise by EUR440 million from the EUR2.42 billion recorded in financial 2019. 
Shares in Ryanair were up 4.1% in London on Monday at EUR15.46 each.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings swung to a third-quarter net profit on a strong Christmas period, but said on 
Monday that delivery of the Boeing 737 MAX jet was unlikely until the autumn, setting back the budget airline's 
growth plan. 
Ryanair said it swung to a third quarter net profit of EUR88 million from a EUR66 million loss a year before. 
Revenue for the quarter ended December 31 came in at EUR1.91 billion, up 21% from EUR1.58 billion a year ago, 
in what is a seasonally weak period for airlines.
Ryanair reported passenger growth of 6% to 35.9 million from 33.8 million, while its passenger load factor was 96%, 
up from 95% a year previous.
Ryanair said the first Boeing 737 MAX delivery is unlikely before September or October. Due to the delay in 
receiving delivery, it will not see any of the expected cost savings from the fuel-efficient jet until late 2021 and as a 
result plans to extend its 200 million passenger per annum target by at "least one or two years" to financial 2025 or 
2026.
Ryanair expects annual earnings in financial 2020 to be at the mid-point of its latest profit after tax guidance. Earlier 
this month, Ryanair upped its annual profit after tax guidance range to between EUR950 million and EUR1.1 billion.
The stock was up 3.6% in early trading in London on Monday.

Eleven more evacuees from coronavirus-hit China are beginning a two-week quarantine period after they were 
flown back to the UK on Sunday evening. The British nationals and family members arrived at RAF Brize Norton on 
a flight from France shortly before 8pm and will join 83 people already in isolation at Arrowe Park Hospital in the 
Wirral. The latest repatriation flight came as a man in the Philippines became the first person to die from the virus 
outside China, where the death toll has risen above 300. Chinese authorities said the number of confirmed cases of 
infection had increased to 14,380. A University of York student and their relative remain the only two confirmed 
cases in the UK and the pair are being treated at a specialist unit in Newcastle.

Most manufacturers believe the UK's exit from the European Union will have an impact on their business, with 
barriers to growth including a shortage of skilled workers, a new study suggests. Research by advisory firm Crowe

& the Confederation of British Metalforming indicated that most firms viewed hiring foreign employees as positive. 
Future tariffs and global economic conditions were the main concerns of manufacturing firms for 2020, said the 
report. Despite uncertainty over the impact of Brexit, there was a cautious mood of optimism for economic growth 
prospects this year, it was found.

Profits at UK-listed companies fell for the second quarter in-a-row in the final three months of 2019, according to a 
new report. Revenues also sank during the period for the first time in three years, with low oil prices helping to 
intensify the earnings recession for listed businesses, The Share Centre's Profit Watch research found. Profits 
dropped 10% on average during the three-month period – making it the third consecutive quarter to see more than 
half of listed companies reporting lower profits. The proportion of companies growing their bottom line has declined 
from a peak of 70% in 2017 and is now the lowest since the last economic recession a decade ago, at 49%, the 
report added.

The man shot dead by police following a stabbing attack in south London was a convicted terrorist who had recently 
been released from prison and was under surveillance. Fanatic Sudesh Amman, 20, who was jailed for possessing 
and distributing terrorist documents in December 2018, had been freed in the past six weeks. He was released 
despite a warning that he posed a continued risk, prompting renewed concerns about how convicted terrorists are 
dealt with in the justice system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will announce plans on Monday for 
"fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences" following the Streatham 
attack. He had already promised changes following the London Bridge attack in November when another recently-
released terrorist, Usman Khan, stabbed two people to death while wearing a fake suicide vest at a prisoner 
rehabilitation event in Fishmongers' Hall.

The Irish manufacturing sector made a strong start to 2020 with a return to expansion, as well as increased 
optimism, survey data from AIB and IHS Markit revealed. The AIB manufacturing purchasing managers' index stood 
at 51.4 in January, up from 49.5 in December, the first reading above the neutral threshold since October, and the 
highest turnout since April 2019. AIB said the upturn was due to stronger underlying demand for Irish manufactured 
goods, as new orders rose on higher export demand, as the US economy stabilised and the UK market improved.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are set to open higher on Monday, rebounding from sharp losses on 
Friday, despite fears over the spread of coronavirus sending Asian markets lower.
In early company news, Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings swung to a third-quarter net profit on a strong Christmas 
period, but said delivery of the Boeing 737 MAX was unlikely until the autumn, setting back its growth plans. 
Tobacco firm Imperial Brands poached car dealer Inchcape's chief executive.
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 15.49 points higher at 7,301.50. The FTSE 100 
index closed down 95.95 points, or 1.3%, at 7,286.01 Friday.
Ryanair said it swung to a third quarter net profit of EUR88 million from a EUR66 million loss a year before. 
Revenue for the quarter ended December 31 came in at EUR1.91 billion, up 21% from EUR1.58 billion a year ago, 
in what is a seasonally weak period for airlines.

new era for our company. The Just Eat Takeaway.com merger provides the scale that is a necessary condition to 
remain competitive in a globalised environment. Our ambitions, however, reach much further. It is our intent to lead

a dedication to our social responsibility.
"Following the CMA's discretionary decision to conduct an investigation into the merger, we will work quickly to

China's death toll from a new coronavirus jumped above 360 on Monday to surpass the number of fatalities of its 
SARS crisis two decades ago, with dozens of people dying in the epicentre's quarantined ground-zero.
The 57 confirmed new deaths was the single-biggest increase since the virus was detected late last year in the 
central city of Wuhan, where it is believed to have jumped from animals at a market into humans. The virus has 
since spread to more than 24 countries, despite many governments imposing unprecedented travel bans on people 
coming from China.
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.0%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 
8.0%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.3%. Shanghai reopened on Monday after being closed all 
last week for a extended Lunar New Year holiday.
Gold was quoted at USD1,579.60 an ounce early Monday, lower than USD1,586.60 late Friday.
Brent oil was at USD56.28 a barrel early Monday, down from USD56.86 late Friday.
China's manufacturing sector started the new year with the slowest rate of growth in five months, IHS Markit 
reported.
The Caixin purchasing managers' index was 51.1 in January, down from 51.5 in December. January's figure marks 
the slowest rate of improvement since August, which stood at 50.4. A figure over 50 reflects expansion, while below 
means contraction.
However, optimism for the year ahead rose to a 22-month high, due to an easing of US-China trade tensions 
following the signing of a phase one trade deal, as well as new product launches and expectations for improving 
global demand conditions.
Japan's manufacturing weakness continued in January, figures showed on Monday, with output reduced for the 
13th successive month. The Jibun Bank Japan manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 48.8 in 
January, a slight improvement from 48.4 in December but still below the neutral 50.0 mark.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3158 early Monday, lower than USD1.3186 at the London equities close on Friday, as 
the UK looks ahead to life outside the European Union.
The euro was trading at USD1.1081 early Monday, flat against USD1.1083 late Friday. Against the yen, the dollar 
was quoted at JPY108.51 firm versus JPY108.40 late Friday.

COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings reported a profit in the third quarter, compared to a loss the year before, on better-than-expected 
Christmas and New Year bookings. In the three months to December 31 - traditionally a weak season for airlines - 
the budget airline recorded operating profit of EUR91.3 million, compared to a loss of EUR68.0 million for the same 
period a year before. Total operating revenue in the third quarter was up 21% year on year to EUR1.91 billion from 
EUR1.58 billion. Traffic rose 6.2% to 35.9 million, while revenue per passenger grew 13%. Turning to the ongoing 
Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery delays, Ryanair said it is now likely the first delivery will be September or October 
2020. The aircraft were grounded after hundreds of people were killed in two crashes. Ryanair added its target to 
carry 200 million passengers a year would have to wait until financial 2025 or 2026.

Imperial Brands said car dealer Inchcape's current Chief Executive Stefan Bomhard will join the tobacco company 
in the same role, effective at a future date. The FTSE 100-listed tobacco company added that Alison Cooper has 
stepped down as chief executive and as a board director with immediate effect now that a replacement has been 
found for her. Imperial Brands has appointed Dominic Brisby, currently divisional director for Americas, Africa, Asia 
& Australasia region, and Joerg Biebernick, divisional director of Europe, as joint interim chief executive officers, 
until Bomhard assumes the top post.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK manufacturing sector stopped shrinking in January as political uncertainty subsided following the 
Conservative Party's victory in the general election in December, according to IHS Markit. The IHS/CIPS 
manufacturing purchasing managers' index reading came in at the neutral mark of 50.0 in January, up from 
December's figure of 47.5. The score was a nine-month high and also beat the flash estimate of 49.8. Any reading 
below 50 indicates contraction, while one above expansion. The UK manufacturing PMI last posted a reading above 
the neutral 50.0 mark in April last year.
----------
The eurozone's manufacturing sector remained in decline in January, although somewhat tempered, numbers 
showed on Monday, with business confidence at the highest level in 16 months. IHS Markit's eurozone 
manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 47.9 in January, from 46.3 in December and marginally above 
the 47.8 flash estimate. It is however the 12 month in succession that the index has come in below the 50.0 mark 
which separates contraction from expansion. France manufacturing sector continued to expand, and at a faster rate

in January. The manufacturing PMI rose to 51.1 from 50.4 in December. Germany was the eurozone's weakest 
performer again in January. The manufacturing PMI rose to an 11-month high of 45.3 in January from 43.7 in 
December, however.

China accused the US of spreading "panic" in its response to the deadly coronavirus, including imposing a ban on 
Chinese travellers. The US "hasn't provided any substantial assistance" and has only created "panic", said foreign 
ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a regular press briefing. Washington on Friday declared a public health 
emergency and temporarily banned the entry of foreign nationals who have travelled to China over the past two 
weeks, to contain the spread of the outbreak. Sweeping new restrictions will also be imposed on American citizens, 
with those returning from the province at the disease's epicentre placed in facilities for a mandatory 14-day 
quarantine. There have been eight confirmed US cases of the new coronavirus, which originated in a live seafood 
market in Wuhan, in China's Hubei province. The virus has since spread to more than 24 countries, despite many 
governments imposing unprecedented travel bans on people coming from China. The World Health Organization 
has already declared the outbreak a global emergency, and the Chinese death toll has risen to 362 while total 
infections reached over 17,000, surpassing the SARS epidemic of two decades ago. On Sunday the first foreign 
death from the virus was reported in the Philippines.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has threatened to walk away without a Brexit trade deal rather than accepting EU 
rules as battle lines were being drawn up by the two sides. The PM will use a speech to say there is "no need" for 
the UK to commit to following the "full panoply" of Brussels' regulations. But the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier 
is likely to stress that the further the UK moves from the EU model, the greater the barriers to trade will be, as he 
sets out his position in Brussels. Barnier underscored the difficulties of the trade negotiations with the UK ahead for 
the rest of the year when he highlighted the small but emblematic fisheries industry, which was a key issue in the 
protracted Brexit process in the UK too. Barnier told France Inter radio that "there will be no trade deal with the 
British if there is no reciprocal access deal for our fishermen".

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened flat to lower on Monday, with miners weighing on the FTSE 100 
following weak PMI data from China and fears over the spreading coronavirus.
The internationally exposed FTSE 100 index was up just 0.61 of a point at 7,286.62
The more UK domestic-oriented FTSE 250 was up 10.89 points at 21,153.88, and the AIM All-Share was down 
1.02 points, or 0.1% at 949.97.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 0.3% at 12,384.20. The Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 19,174.66, and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies was flat at 12,464.40.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up 0.3%.
In the FTSE 100, SSE rose 1.5% early Monday after Barclays raised the electricity utility to Overweight from Equal 
Weight.
At the other end of the large-cap index, internationally exposed mining stocks were in the red following 
disappointing purchasing managers' index data from China.
Rio Tinto was down 1.2%, BHP down 1.1%, Anglo American down 1.0% and Glencore down 0.7%.
China's manufacturing sector started the new year with the slowest rate of growth in five months, IHS Markit 
reported.
The Caixin purchasing managers' index was 51.1 in January, down from 51.5 in December. January's figure marks 
the slowest rate of improvement since August, when the index stood at 50.4. A figure over 50 reflects expansion in 
the manufacturing sector, while below means contraction.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Miners, Oil Stocks Weigh On FTSE 100; PMIs To Come
However, optimism for the year ahead rose to a 22-month high, due to an easing of US-China trade tensions 
following the signing of a phase one trade deal, as well as new product launches and expectations for improving 
global demand conditions.
Shares in oil majors were in the red, tracking spot oil prices lower, with Royal Dutch Shell 'A' and 'B' shares down 
0.9% and 0.8% respectively. Shares in BP, which reports annual results on Tuesday, were off 0.3%.
Brent oil was at USD56.32 a barrel early Monday, down from USD56.86 late Friday.
In the FTSE 250, Future was the best performer, up 5.5%. The magazine publisher said it expects annual results to 
be "materially ahead" of current market expectations, despite some uncertainty in the macro-economic 
environment.
At the other end of the large cap index, Aston Martin Lagonda was the worst performer, down 4.5% at 475.65 
pence after Goldman Sachs cut its price target on the luxury carmaker to 390p from 520p.
Elsewhere, Ryanair Holdings was up 4.4%. The Irish carrier said it swung to a third-quarter net profit on a strong 
Christmas period.
Ryanair reported a net profit of EUR88 million, versus a EUR66 million loss a year before. Revenue for the quarter 
ended December 31 came in at EUR1.91 billion, up 21% from EUR1.58 billion a year ago, in what is a seasonally 
weak period for airlines.
Ryanair reported passenger growth of 6% to 35.9 million from 33.8 million, while its passenger load factor was 96%, 
up from 95% a year previous.
Ryanair expects annual earnings in financial 2020 to be at the mid-point of its latest profit after tax guidance. Earlier 
this month, Ryanair upped its annual profit after tax guidance range to between EUR950 million and EUR1.1 billion.
Peer easyJet was up 1.3% in a positive read-across.
In Asia on Monday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.0%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed 
down 7.7%, but the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed up 0.3%. Shanghai reopened on Monday after being 
closed all last week for a extended Lunar New Year holiday.
Eleven more evacuees from coronavirus-hit China are beginning a two-week quarantine period after they were 
flown back to the UK on Sunday evening. 
The British nationals and family members arrived at RAF Brize Norton on a flight from France shortly before 2000 
GMT and will join 83 people already in isolation at Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral. 
The latest repatriation flight came as a man in the Philippines became the first person to die from the virus outside 
China, where the death toll has risen above 300. Chinese authorities said the number of confirmed cases of 
infection had increased to 14,380. A University of York student and their relative remain the only two confirmed 
cases in the UK and the pair are being treated at a specialist unit in Newcastle.
Gold was quoted at USD1,575.60 an ounce early Monday, lower than USD1,586.60 late Friday.
Sterling was quoted at USD1.3144 early Monday, lower than USD1.3186 at the London equities close on Friday, as 
the UK looks ahead to life outside the European Union.
The EU and UK will set the stage for Brexit's next bruising chapter on Monday, laying down their vision and red 
lines for a post-divorce future following the UK's dramatic exit from the bloc.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Miners, Oil Stocks Weigh On FTSE 100; PMIs To Come
After three years of fractious divorce talks, the next phase is promising to be just as bitter with a combative Prime 
Minister Boris Johnson insisting his country has nothing to prove to the EU now its 47-year membership of the bloc 
is at an end.
The colliding visions of EU-UK relations will need to be hammered out at an unprecedented pace with Johnson 
having flatly refused to extend the negotiating period beyond the end of this year.
Europe's Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier will propose his vision for a new foundation for ties in Brussels, with trade 
the most pressing issue, while Johnson will make his case in a speech in London.
The euro was trading at USD1.1081 early Monday, flat against USD1.1083 late Friday. Against the yen, the dollar 
was quoted at JPY108.51 firm versus JPY108.40 late Friday.
The economic calendar on Monday has a swathe of manufacturing PMIs, from the eurozone, the UK, and the US.

(Alliance News) - Budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it signed a new four-year pay 
agreement with Irish pilots, following a dispute which even led to strike action being threatened in August. 
The deal with union Forsa, will see Ryanair adopt a new pay structure and implement a fixed 5/4 shift pattern, 
consisting of five successive days of work, followed by four days off. 
The four-year collective labour agreement was arranged by Kieran Mulvey, an independent mediator.
The airline said: "Ryanair would like to thank Kieran Mulvey for his contribution and expertise in overseeing this 
mediation process which has now concluded."
In August, Irish pilots voted in favour of industrial action over pay, trade union Forsa said. 
Around 180 pilots directly employed by the budget airline in Ireland, and who are members of the Irish Air Line 
Pilots' Association, were eligible to vote. A 94% majority favoured the industrial action.
Ryanair branded the vote as "unlawful" and took the matter to the Dublin High Court, which approved the airline's 
bid to stop the proposed strike. 
That same month however, the company lost a High Court bid to block strike action by its UK pilots. 
On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Ryanair is planning potential base closures and job cuts due to delays in the 
delivery of Boeing Co's 737 MAX aircraft into the autumn. 
According to an internal memo dated Tuesday, Ryanair said it expects the aircraft maker to not deliver the first 737 
MAX until September or October at the earliest, according to Reuters.
The 737 MAX was grounded by aviation regulators last year following two fatal crashes.

(Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC warned of potential base closures and job cuts due to 
delays in the delivery of Boeing Co's 737 MAX aircraft into the autumn, Reuters reported Tuesday.
According to an internal memo dated Tuesday, Ryanair said it expects the aircraft maker to not deliver the first 737 
MAX until September or October at the earliest, according to Reuters. 
The 737 MAX was grounded by aviation regulators last year following two fatal crashes.
This comes against Ryanair's expectations in November 2019 of first delivery in March or April, as the airline does 
not take deliveries of new aircraft during its peak summer months from June to August.

Tuesday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
easyJet, up 4.8%. The budget airline said it has started its new financial year strongly, as it upgraded its passenger 
revenue guidance. In the first quarter of financial 2020, ended December 31, easyJet said its total revenue grew 
9.9% year on year to GBP1.43 billion, with passenger revenue rising 9.7% to GBP1.12 billion and ancillary revenue 
adding 11% to GBP301 million. Passenger numbers in the first quarter increased by 2.8% to 22.2 million, with 
capacity increasing 1.0% to 24.3 million seats. Load factor was up 1.6 percentage points to 91.3%. Revenue per 
seat in the first half is guided to grow by mid-to-high single digits - versus previous guidance of low-to-mid single 
digits. The airline's revenue per seat in the first half financial 2019 was GBP50.71. "While the past year has been a 
bumpy one for the airline industry, easyJet has weathered the turbulence better than most, picking up customers 
from strike-ridden British Airways and Ryanair along the way," said eToro analyst Adam Vettese.
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
BHP Group, down 2.4%. The Anglo-Australian miner kept the majority of its annual production guidance 
unchanged. For the six months to the end of December, BHP's copper production was 885,400 tonnes, up 7% from 
825,300 tonnes the year before, as output grew from the Escondida and Pampa Norte mines in Chile, and the

Olympic Dam mine in Australia. The group kept its annual copper production guidance unchanged at 1.71 million 
tonnes to 1.82 million tonnes. Metallurgical coal production dropped by 2% year-on-year to 20.3 million tonnes from 
20.6 million tonnes due to major wash shutdowns at Goonyella, Peak Downs and Caval Ridge at BHP's 
Queensland Coal operations in Australia. Fellow Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto was down 2.7%. 
----------
Pearson, down 2.2%. UBS downgraded the education publisher to Neutral from Buy.
----------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
Dixons Carphone, up 6.0%. The electrical goods and mobile phone retailer said trading in the peak festive season 
in the UK was solid, despite a weak market. UK & Ireland Electricals revenue was 1% higher on a reported basis 
and up 2% like-for-like. However, Dixons posted an 11% drop in UKI Mobile revenue, with the like-for-like figure 
falling by 9%. London-headquartered Dixons said there was "broad-based" growth in televisions, gaming, smart 
technology, and small domestic appliances, while the decline in Mobile revenue was in line with expectations. 
Dixons managed to increase market share both in-store and online in the Electricals segment, it noted. "Dixons sold 
over 8,000 smart speakers a day over the crucial festive period, while over 75% more 65+ inch TVs were shifted, 
and the group gained market share both in-store, and crucially, online too. Boosting the online business is one of 
the pillars of the turnaround plan, so it's good to see Dixons making headway in this area, particularly in such a 
crowded marketplace," said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Sophie Lund-Yates.
----------
SSP Group, up 3.5%. The Upper Crust and Millie's Cookies food outlet operator said it made a "good" start to its 
financial year, though Europe continues to be affected by strikes in France. Revenue in the first quarter ended 
December rose 7.5% constant currency, with the figure rising by 6.1% at actually currency rates. Like-for-like sales 
growth at constant currency was 1.2%. SSP said the like-for-like growth figure met expectations, with headwinds 
noted in the second half of its last financial year continuing into its new year. Looking ahead, SSP has held like-for-
like sales growth guidance for its financial year at just below 2%. It is confident of "another year of strong growth", 
though noted uncertainty will always exist over passenger numbers in the short-term. 
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
7digital group, up 33%. The digital music and radio services platform said its 2019 outcome will be in line with 
management expectations and will be operationally profitable in 2020 due to the new revised business strategy and 
further reduction in costs. 7digital said the cost reduction programme has reduced cost run rate by over 50% and 
resulted in annual savings of over GBP7 million in 2019. For 2020, 7digital has already secured much of its 
expected revenue for the year and, as a result, is on track to achieve operational profitability by the end of the 
second quarter.
----------
eve Sleep, up 18%. The mattress manufacturer said a shift towards more efficient marketing and streamlining of 
cost base had resulted in a sharply narrowed adjusted loss for 2019. The London-based company said it has 
continued to progress its rebuild strategy, prioritising long term profitability and cash generation over short-term 
sales growth and market share gains. For 2019, the company expects to post a loss before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortisation of GBP10.8 million, narrowed from GBP19.2 million loss a year ago. Group revenue

in the company's Core markets is estimated to total GBP23.8 million versus GBP29.3 million. Cash burn is

Flybe Says UK Tax Holiday "Will Only Last A Matter Of Months"

(Alliance News) - Airline Flybe, which earlier this week struck a deal with the UK government to stave off collapse, 
on Thursday said its tax break agreement will only be temporary and it will pay roughly GBP10 million worth of 
levies in full. 
Flybe, which is owned by Connect Airways, a joint venture among Stobart Group Ltd, Virgin Atlantic and investment 
adviser Cyrus Capital Partners, said the reprieve from HMRC "will only last a matter of months, before all taxes and 
duties are paid in full". 
Flybe explained: "A payment plan was agreed with HMRC for a debt of less than GBP10 million. 
"This is a standard time to pay arrangement with HMRC that any business in financial difficulties may use."
Also on Thursday, Ryanair Holdings PLC had warned that the tax exemption given by the UK government to 
"billionaire owned" Flybe will be in breach of competition and state aid rules unless the government extends the 
same to other airline operators.
In a letter to UK Chancellor Sajid Javid, Ryanair asked the government to extend the the air passenger duty 
"holiday" given to Flybe to all of its UK airline competitors including Ryanair, easyJet PLC and British Airways, 
owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.
Air passenger duty is a levy imposed on passenger flights from the UK.
Ryanair, in its letter, claimed that Flybe's business model was neither "profitable" nor "viable" and that it is owned by 
"billionaires including Richard Branson, Delta Airlines and Cyrus Capital," who do not need a government subsidy to 
prop up their "failed airline investments". 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in the letter: "The reason why Flybe isn't viable is because it cannot 
compete with lower fare services from UK regional airports on domestic and EU routes provided by Ryanair, 
Flybe Says UK Tax Holiday "Will Only Last A Matter Of Months"
Easyjet, BA and others; and it cannot compete with lower cost road and rail alternatives on many smaller UK 
domestic routes. 
"If Flybe fails, as it undoubtedly will once this government subsidy ends, then Ryanair, Easyjet, BA and others will 
step in and provide lower fare flights from the UK regional airports, as we already have to make up for the recent 
failure of Thomas Cook Airways."
Stobart separately on Thursday said it would provide an extra GBP9 million in short-term funding to Connect 
Airways.
Stobart shares were up 0.7% at 110.80 pence Friday morning. Ryanair shares were up 0.8% at EUR15.85.

(Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group SA on Friday said it will remove a policy which meant 
the British Airways owner would need a limit on the maximum number non-European Union shareholders. 
As of Friday, IAG said just short of 40% of its shareholders were non-EU, though the percentage was as high at 
48% in February 11, 2019. 
Last February, IAG decided it was "necessary to specify a maximum aggregate number" of stock attributed to non-
EU shareholders. It was policy added to its bylaws. 
IAG on Friday said that although the policy has been withdrawn, it will continue to "monitor its number of relevant 
non-EU shareholders". 
Shares in IAG were 5.1% higher at 670.60 pence each in London on Friday morning. 
In March, 2019, budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC decided all shares held by non-EU shareholders, including 
those held by UK shareholders, were to lose their right to attend, speak, or vote at company meetings. 
The ban on non-EU nationals buying shares, which has been in place since 2002, was extended to include UK 
citizens. The Irish airline's board implemented the resolutions to protect the company in the case of a no-deal 
Brexit.

IAG's British Airways Accused Of Emitting More Carbon Than Rivals

(Alliance News) - British Airways emits up to 45% more CO2 per passenger compared with rival airlines on identical 
routes, according to new research.
The UK flag carrier, part of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, has the worst carbon emissions 
performance on four out of six routes analysed for Which? Travel, the magazine said.
British Airways described the inquiry as "shoddy", claiming the figures are outdated and inaccurate.
But Which? Travel insisted it was standing by the data, which was provided by carbon analytics firm Flyzen.
The investigation found that one passenger flying from Heathrow to Miami with British Airways would be 
responsible for 1,133kg of carbon, which is almost a third more than the figure of 861kg for the same journey with 
Virgin Atlantic.
On the Stansted to Palma de Mallorca route, British Airways emits 160kg of CO2 per passenger, which is nearly 
50% more than Ryanair Holdings PLC, Jet2.com or Tui AG – which all stand at 109kg. Jet2 is owned by Dart Group 
PLC.
Which? Travel noted that flag carriers such as British Airways tend to use older fleets of wide-bodied aircraft, which 
use more fuel.
They also carry more passengers in premium cabins, which results in lower capacities and an increased carbon 
footprint per person.
The worst case identified by Which? Travel was indirect flights from Heathrow to Singapore, with Cathay Pacific 
producing three-quarters more CO2 emissions per passenger than KLM.
IAG's British Airways Accused Of Emitting More Carbon Than Rivals
The difference is largely due to Cathay Pacific passengers changing planes in Hong Kong, whereas KLM 
customers spend two fewer hours in the air by connecting in Amsterdam.
Which? Travel editor Rory Boland said: "These figures show that swapping to a greener airline will allow the many 
of us concerned about climate change to immediately and significantly reduce our individual carbon footprint.
"If millions of us were to switch to a less polluting airline on our next holiday, it would bring pressure to bear on the 
worst polluting airlines and force them to prioritise their impact on the environment by introducing more efficient 
aircraft and cleaner fuels."
A Panorama investigation broadcast in November last year claimed British Airways emits 18,000 tonnes of 
additional CO2 annually by fuel-tankering, which involves filling up planes with extra fuel to avoid topping up at 
airports where prices are higher.
A British Airways spokeswoman said: "The conversation about climate change is too important to be undermined by 
the for-profit organisation Which? using shoddy research based on data which is several years out of date.
"Which? only looked at 2% of our flights and their paid-for calculations, hidden behind a pay wall, are completely at 
odds with the figures calculated by the range of airlines they claim to have investigated.
"We are committed to net zero by 2050 and we are open to discussion on our approach to reducing our carbon 
emissions with anyone who is interested in accurate and robust data."
The airline began off-setting the carbon emissions from all its domestic flights at the beginning of the year.
It is also investing in sustainable jet fuel and replacing older aircraft.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday warned that the tax exemption given by the UK government to 
"billionaire owned" rival Flybe will be in breach of competition and state aid rules unless the government extends 
the same to other airline operators.
Flybe, which earlier this week was on the verge of collapse, received a reprieve late Tuesday, after the UK 
government told the airline it would review air passenger duty. Flybe shareholders agreed to inject extra capital into 
the airline on the basis of the tax exemption.
Air passenger duty is a levy imposed on passenger flights from the UK. 
Flybe is owned by Connect Airways, a joint venture between Stobart Group Ltd,  Virgin Atlantic and investment 
adviser Cyrus Capital Partners. Stobart separately on Thursday said it would provide an extra GBP9 million in short 
term funding to Connect Airways.
In a letter to UK Chancellor Sajid Javid, Ryanair asked the government to extend the the air passenger duty 
"holiday" given to Flybe to all of its UK airline competitors including Ryanair, easyJet PLC and British Airways, 
owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.
The company warned that failure to extend the tax exemption would mean that the UK government subsidy to Flybe 
would be in breach of competition and state aid rules.
Ryanair, in its letter, claimed that Flybe's business model was neither "profitable" nor "viable" and that it is owned by 
"billionaires including Richard Branson, Delta Airlines and Cyrus Capital," who do not need a government subsidy to 
prop up their "failed airline investments". 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in the letter: "The reason why Flybe isn't viable is because it cannot 
compete with lower fare services from UK regional airports on domestic and EU routes provided by Ryanair,

Easyjet, BA and others; and it cannot compete with lower cost road and rail alternatives on many smaller UK 
domestic routes. If Flybe fails, as it undoubtedly will once this government subsidy ends, then Ryanair, Easyjet, BA 
and others will step in and provide lower fare flights from the UK regional airports, as we already have to make up 
for the recent failure of Thomas Cook Airways."
"This Flybe 'subsidy' cannot comply with Competition, or State Aid rules unless the same APD eco tax holiday and 
other government subsidies are extended to all other UK competitor airlines including Ryanair, Easyjet, BA among 
others," O'Leary added.
Dublin-based Ryanair's intervention follows that of Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG. On 
Wednesday, Walsh described the UK government's tax exemption to Flybe as a "blatant misuse of public cash". 
IAG has filed a complaint with the European Union over the UK government's decision to rescue Flybe.
IAG's complaint argues that the government is propping up "feeder flights" that benefit Virgin and Delta.
Ryanair shares were up 0.7% at EUR15.70 in London on Thursday afternoon. IAG shares were down 0.8% at 
638.40p, while easyJet traded 1.7% lower at 1,474.50p. Stobart Group was up 1.1% at 111.43p.

Ryanair Cuts Over 200 Jobs In Spain Amid Canary Island Base Closures
Ryanair Cuts Over 200 Jobs In Spain Amid Canary Island Base Closures

(Alliance News) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday it cut more than 200 jobs in Spain as it 
closed three bases in the Canary Islands.
The number of job losses is far less than the 512 posts that unions had feared would be lost, however.
"There were over 200 dismissals in the Canaries, that was just pilots and cabin crew, no other staff," the airline's 
human resource director, Darrell Hugues, told a Madrid news conference.
Ryanair said in August that it would close bases in Tenerife, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria, as well as one in Girona 
in mainland Spain, leading Spanish union USO to predict that 512 jobs could be lost. In the end Ryanair kept the 
base in Girona open.
The company justified the need to reduce its presence on the ground by delays in the delivery of the grounded 
Boeing 737 MAX, which it says has left it with more pilots and crew than necessary.
"We don't have enough airplanes so we're closing bases," Hugues explained.
After the three Canary Islands sites closed last week, Ryanair moved some pilots and cabin crew who were based 
there elsewhere in Europe, he added without giving further details.
The company did not close its base in Girona after employees there signed new contracts making them seasonal 
workers, confirming information given by the USOC union last month, Hugues said.
Under the new contract the employees are contracted to work nine months of the year instead of 12, which means 
their annual salaries would be reduced by around 25% according to the union.
About 100 employees at Ryanair's base in Girona accepted the new conditions, while those who refused were fired, 
Hugues said.

Ryanair expects to get up to 10 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in March-April, the airline's marketing director, Kenny 
Jacobs, said.
But it has no plans "at the moment" to reopen the Canary Islands bases once that happens, he added.
On Friday, Ryanair raised its annual profit forecast for its current financial year that ends in March, citing strong 
bookings and a better than expected Christmas/New Year travel period.

(Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC raised its full-year guidance on Friday after a surprising 
Christmas period and said forward bookings for January to April have risen year-on-year. 
The carrier upped its annual profit after tax guidance range to between EUR950 million and EUR1.1 billion, which 
could represent year-on-year hike of up to 19% from EUR885.0 million. 
It previously expected full-year profit after tax for the 12 months to March 31 to fall between the EUR800 million and 
EUR900 million range. 
In an unscheduled statement, the airline said the festive period was "characterised by higher than expected close-in 
bookings at better than expected yields."
Ryanair added: "On the basis of current trading, Ryanair expects to finish close to the mid-point of this new range."
Forward bookings for the first four months of 2020 are 1% higher year-on-year, with financial 2020 traffic tipped to 
climb to 8.5% to 154 million, up from previous guidance of growth to 153 million. Traffic in financial 2019 came in at 
142 million passengers. Average fares in the fourth quarter are anticipated to be "better than expected". 
Despite this, Ryanair's Austrian budget subsidiary Laudamotion continued to underperform, the company 
conceded, facing "intense" pressure from Germany's flag carrier Deutsche Lufthansa AG's subsidiaries. 
As a result of "price competition", Laudamotion's average fares over Christmas were lower than forecast despite 
traffic growth and high load factors.
Ryanair warned that the unit's losses will widen in financial 2020. 
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Lifts Guidance After Better-Than-Expected Christmas
Ryanair said: "Lauda now expects to carry 6.5 million passengers in the year to March 2020 but at average fares 
that are EUR15 below budget, with the result that Lauda's net loss for the year will widen from under EUR80 million 
to approximately EUR90 million."
Ryanair will release a third quarter earnings update on February 3, ahead of its full-year report, scheduled on May 
18. 
Shares in the company closed flat at EUR15.23 each in London on Thursday.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair said Friday that trading was stronger than expected over the festive period, 
and as a result it has raised its annual profit guidance.
For its financial year ending March, the Irish carrier sees post-tax profit between EUR950 million to EUR1.05 billion, 
having previously guided for EUR800 million to EUR900 million. In financial 2019, Ryanair reported profit after tax 
of EUR885.0 million.
In an unscheduled update, Ryanair said trading was boosted by better-than-expected close-in bookings over 
Christmas and New Year, while forward bookings to April are 1% higher year-on-year which will lead to higher-than-
expected fares.
One downside for Ryanair is Laudamotion. The recently purchased Austrian airline is underperforming due to lower-
than-expected fares over the festive period. Fares are being hurt by intense competition in both Germany and 
Austria, Ryanair said.

It is "highly likely" that Iran shot down the civilian Ukrainian jetliner that crashed near Tehran, killing all 176 people 
on board, US, Canadian and British officials have said. They said the fiery missile strike could well have been a 
mistake amid rocket launches and high tension throughout the region. The crash on Wednesday morning came just 
a few hours after Iran launched a ballistic attack against Iraqi military bases housing US troops in its violent 
confrontation with Washington over the drone strike that killed an Iranian Revolutionary Guard general. The airliner 
could have been mistaken for a threat, said four US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss 
sensitive intelligence. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least 63 citizens in the 
downing, said in Ottawa: "We have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence. 
The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile." Likewise, UK Prime 
Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison offered similar statements.Morrison also said it 
appeared to be a mistake. "All of the intelligence as presented to us today does not suggest an intentional act," he 
said.

Sportswear retailer JD Sports Fashion reiterated full-year guidance and reported "positive like-for-like trends" over 
the pivotal Christmas trading period, despite the UK retail market facing tricky conditions. The company said full-
year headline pretax profit, after removing the impact of IFRS 16, will fall in the "upper quartile" of market 
consensus range of GBP403 million and GBP433 million. This could represent a annual jump of as much as 27% 
from last year's pretax profit of GBP339.9 million. IFRS 16 governs the financial treatment of leases. JD Sports 
said: "Against a backdrop of widely reported retail challenges in the group's core UK market, it is encouraging to 
report positive like-for-like trends in the group's global sports fashion fascias, particularly overseas."

British Land had its application for an 18-storey building in the Paddington area of London rejected by Westminster 
City Council, the Times newspaper reported on Thursday. The property developer bought the 11-acre Paddington 
plot in 2013 intending to build an 18-storey "terracota" office block. However, the council rejected its plans over 
concerns that the building would be too high, affect views, block sunlight and look out of place, according to the 
newspaper. British Land told the Times that it is "disappointed" with the council's decision and will review its 
options.

came against a backdrop of poor retail conditions and a decision not to carry out any early discounting, B&M said. 
Heron Foods is doing well, the company continued, with like-for-like sales growth solid. B&M is making progress at 
French subsidiary Babou, it added. However Jawoll, B&M's German business, reported a 1.5% fall in revenue for

Fashion retailer Superdry said trading has not been as strong as expected in the period between October 27 and 
January 4, despite a strong Black Friday. Superdry said there has been "unprecedented" promotional activity as 
well as subdued consumer demand post-Christmas. "These factors, combined with shortages of some better-selling 
product, driven by the need to reduce our inherited inventory position, adversely impacted our sales during peak 
trading," Superdry added. Retail sales have missed expectations by GBP23 million, the company continued, while 
wholesale operations have suffered a GBP5 million shortfall due to timing issues. As a result, Superdry now sees 
underlying pretax profit for its year ending April between zero and GBP10 million.

Boeing said it regrets the content of communications provided to US Congress and the Federal Aviation

messages, an employee, talking in 2017 about the MAX, said it had been designed by "clowns". The MAX has been 
grounded since mid-March following the second of the two fatal crashes that together claimed 346 lives. The NYT 
said one employee, in an exchange in 2018, before the first crash, said to another colleague: "Would you put your

(Alliance News) - Stocks in London ended lower on Friday as disappointing US jobs numbers snapped the FTSE 
100's two-day winning streak, despite a rise from travel stocks after Ryanair upgraded its profit guidance. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 10.27 points, or 0.1% at 7,587.85. ending the week down 0.5%. 
The FTSE 250 ended down 76.40 points, or 0.4% at 21,566.67, ending the week down 1.9%, and the AIM All-Share 
closed down 1.36 points, or 0.1% at 961.65, ending the week down 0.2%.
The Cboe UK 100 ended flat at 12,865.71, the Cboe UK 250 closed down 0.2% at 19,491.52, and the Cboe Small 
Companies ended down 0.2% at 12,399.34.
In Paris the CAC 40 ended down 0.1%, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt ended 0.1%. 
"While we have seen a clear shift away from the US-Iran story, today's jobs report has seen the stock market rally 
hit the buffers. However, with a week ahead that will be dominated by Wednesday's US-China signing ceremony, 
President Donald Trump looks likely to take centre stage once again in a big to bolster market confidence," said IG 
Group's Josh Mahony.
Stocks in New York were mostly higher at the London equities close, as all three major indices hit new intraday 
highs amid continued optimism on US-China trade relations.
The phase one deal - struck last month - is set to reduce tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of US farm, energy 
and manufactured goods while addressing some disputes over intellectual property. It is expected to be signed next 
week.
The DJIA was down 0.2%, but the S&P 500 index was up 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.2%.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Stocks Down After Underwhelming US Jobs Data
On the economic front, employment in the US came in below economist consensus in December, data from the US 
Bureau of Labor Statistics showed.
Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 145,000 in December. The figure missed economist consensus of 
164,000 new jobs.
In November, 256,000 jobs were added, well ahead of consensus, with that figure revised downwards slightly from 
the initially reported 266,000. 
Average hourly earnings in December rose by 0.1% on November to USD28.32, following 0.3% growth in 
November, revised up from 0.2%. The December figure was short of consensus for 0.3% growth.
The unemployment rate held steady at 3.5%, remaining at a 50-year low, according to the Labor Department.
Robert Alster, head of Investment Services at Close Brothers Asset Management said: "Decelerating hiring and 
wage growth shouldn't be a cause for concern in the context of the encouragingly tight US labour market. 
Unemployment is low, and wage growth remains healthily above inflation - this puts more money into consumers' 
pockets and supports economic growth.
"Trump will be relying on strong economic performance as his re-election campaign gets under way. Marginal US 
oil production has reduced global price volatility, but there remains a risk that further tension in the Middle East will 
disrupt supply, causing inflation. Separately, third quarter productivity delivered the biggest fall in nearly four years; 
if this continues, it may provide an unwelcome headwind to growth."
Elsewhere, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced fresh sanctions against eight top Iranian officials 
Washington accused of working to destabilize the region, as well as against more than a dozen leading producers 
of metals in the Islamic republic.
In addition, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US believes it is "likely" that an Iranian missile downed a 
Ukrainian airliner that crashed near Tehran, killing all 176 on board - which Iran has denied.
On the London Stock Exchange, airline operators International Consolidated Airlines and easyJet ended the top two 
blue chip performers, up 4.6% and 4.2% respectively, after peer Ryanair Holdings lifted profit guidance.
Ryanair upped its annual profit after tax guidance range to between EUR950 million and EUR1.1 billion, which 
could represent year-on-year hike of up to 19% from EUR885.0 million. It previously expected full-year profit after 
tax for the 12 months to March 31 to fall between the EUR800 million and EUR900 million range. 
In an unscheduled statement, the airline said the festive period was "characterised by higher than expected close-in 
bookings at better than expected yields".
Further, Ryanair said forward bookings for January to April have risen year-on-year. The stock closed up 5.7%. 
Just Eat closed up 0.6% at 889.15 pence after Naspers spinoff Prosus said its cash offer for takeaway ordering 
platform has lapsed with acceptances from just 158,037 shares or 0.02% of Just Eat's issues share capital.
The 800 pence per share offer from Prosus was not enough to see off rival Takeaway.com's all-share merger bid. 
As at 1300 GMT, the offer closing date, Prosus had not received enough acceptances to meet its acceptance 
condition, holding a that time no existing Just Eat shares.
The final offer has, therefore, lapsed, being no long open to acceptances and with accepting Just Eat shareholders 
no longer bound by their acceptances.
In the FTSE 250, Aston Martin Lagonda ended the best performer, up 15% after the Financial Times reported that 
Lotus and Volvo owner Geely was considering investing in the troubled luxury carmaker.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Stocks Down After Underwhelming US Jobs Data
Earlier this week, the Valkyrie hypercar maker issued another profit warning due to continuation of challenging 
trading conditions. Aston martin added that it was continuing to review funding options, including a potential equity 
capital raise. 
The pound was quoted at USD1.3061 at the London equities close, firm against USD1.3045 at the close Thursday.
The euro stood at USD1.1112 at the European equities close, flat from USD1.1100 late Thursday.
Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY109.60, firm against JPY109.50 late Thursday.

(Alliance News) - London stocks were in the green early on Friday, with airlines getting a boost from peer Ryanair, 
which upped profit guidance after better-than-expected forward bookings over the recent holiday period. 
The FTSE 100 index was up 30.56 points, or 0.4%, at 7,628.68.
The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was up 57.15 points, or 0.3%, at 21,700.22. The AIM All-Share index was 0.2% 
higher at 964.42.
The Cboe UK 100 index was 0.2% higher at 12,891.02. The Cboe 250 was 0.1% higher at 19,548.53, and the Cboe 
Small Companies was flat at 12,421.71. 
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was up 0.2% while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was 0.3% higher.
"With this week's geopolitical risk subsiding as we head towards the weekend, investors now have the opportunity 
to focus on the signing of the signing of the new US, China phase one trade deal next week, as well as the health of 
the US economy today, and in particular the labour market which has continued to look resilient," said Michael 
Hewson at CMC Markets UK. 
Negotiations for the second phase of a pending US-China trade deal will begin promptly but the outcome may wait 
until after this year's elections, US President Donald Trump said Thursday.
Trump's remarks come days before Beijing's trade envoy is due in Washington to sign a "phase one" agreement, 
marking a pause in the two sides' nearly two-year trade war.
Focus Friday will turn to the US jobs report for December at 1330 GMT. This follows a report that employment 
increased by more than expected in December, payroll processor ADP reported on Wednesday. 
In November, US non-farm payrolls showed a big 266,000 rise in jobs. 
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Airlines Climb After Surprise Ryanair Update
"Today's main event is US data. We expect a 150,000 gain in jobs, a steady 3.5% unemployment rate and a slight 
slowing in average hourly earnings growth to 3% due to base effects. The consensus looks for 160,000, and 3.1% 
on wages," said Kit Juckes at Societe Generale. 
Meanwhile, developments in the Middle East took a new, tragic twist. It is "highly likely" that Iran shot down the 
civilian Ukrainian jetliner that crashed near Tehran, killing all 176 people on board, US, Canadian and British 
officials have said.
They said the fiery missile strike could well have been a mistake amid rocket launches and high tension throughout 
the region.
The crash on Wednesday morning came just a few hours after Iran launched a ballistic attack against Iraqi military 
bases housing US troops in its violent confrontation with Washington over the drone strike that killed an Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard general.
The airliner could have been mistaken for a threat, said four US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to 
discuss sensitive intelligence.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country lost at least 63 citizens in the downing, said in Ottawa: 
"We have intelligence from multiple sources including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates 
that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile."
Brent oil was quoted at USD65.19 a barrel Friday, down from USD66.80 at the close Thursday. The price of oil 
touched USD70 shortly after the US killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, but it has since edged back as fears 
of war have receded. 
In the US on Thursday, Wall Street ended in the green, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 0.7%, the 
S&P 500 also up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8% higher.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index ended 0.5% higher on Friday. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed 0.1% 
lower, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong ended up 0.2%.
On the London Stock Exchange, budget airline Ryanair surged 10% as it said trading was stronger than expected 
over the festive period, and as a result it has upped profit guidance. 
For its year ending March, the Irish carrier sees post-tax profit between EUR950 million to EUR1.05 billion, having 
previously guided for EUR800 million to EUR900 million. 
Ryanair said trading was boosted by better-than-expected close-in bookings over Christmas and New Year, while 
forward bookings to April are 1% higher year-on-year which will lead to higher-than-expected fares.
One downside for Ryanair is Laudamotion. The recently purchased Austrian airline is underperforming due to lower-
than-expected fares over the festive period. Fares are being hurt by intense competition in both Germany and 
Austria, Ryanair said. 
Ryanair's unscheduled update boosted FTSE 100 peer International Consolidates Airlines, which was 4.6% higher, 
making it one of the best large-cap performers alongside easyJet, up 5.7%. Midcap peer Wizz Air was 5.9% higher. 
Back in the FTSE 100, sportswear firm JD Sports Fashion was 0.6% higher as it reiterated full-year guidance and 
reported "positive like-for-like trends" over the pivotal Christmas trading period, despite the UK retail market facing 
tricky conditions.
The company said full-year headline pretax profit, after removing the impact of IFRS 16, will fall in the "upper 
quartile" of market consensus range of GBP403 million and GBP433 million. This could represent a annual jump of 
as much as 27% from last year's pretax profit of GBP339.9 million. IFRS 16 governs the financial treatment of 
leases, a big cost for retailers.

JD Sports said: "Against a backdrop of widely reported retail challenges in the group's core UK market, it is 
encouraging to report positive like-for-like trends in the group's global sports fashion fascias, particularly overseas."
Gold miner Polymetal International was 1.4% higher, as Berenberg raised its rating on the stock to Buy from Hold. 
Paper and packaging firm Mondi fell 1.5% as it said Chief Executive Peter Oswald is to leave the company at the 
end of March. He originally joined Mondi in 1992, and has been CEO since early 2017.
Mondi has appointed Chief Financial Officer Andrew King as interim CEO whilst a replacement for Oswald is found, 
the company added. 
FTSE 250 discount retailer B&M European Value Retail slumped 6.1% as it reported 9.3% revenue growth 
excluding currency movements for the 13 weeks to December 28. 
In the UK, revenue growth was 8.8%, and the like-for-like growth figure was 0.3%. This came against a backdrop of 
poor retail conditions and a decision not to carry out any early discounting, B&M said. 
Heron Foods is doing well, the company said, with like-for-like sales growth solid. B&M is making progress at 
French subsidiary Babou, it added. However Jawoll, B&M's German business, reported a 1.5% fall in revenue for 
the quarter at constant currency. A review of the unit's future, announced November, is ongoing. 
Diploma fell 3.5% as Jefferies cut the technical products supplier to Hold from Buy, while Royal Bank of Canada 
lowered it to Underperform from Sector Perform. 
Precision instruments firm Spectris was down 1.3% with Morgan Stanley downgraded it to Underweight from Equal 
Weight, and fund administrator Sanne fell 1.9% as RBC cut it to Sector Perform from Outperform. 
Recruiter PageGroup fell 1.2% after a cut by RBC to Sector Perform from Outperform, and peer Hays was 1.5% 
lower after the same move by RBC.
Building products firm SIG slipped 2.9% as Liberum reduced it to Hold from Buy. Restaurant Group declined 0.7% 
after RBC cut the rating to Sector Perform from Outperform. 
Elsewhere, fashion retailer Superdry fell 20% as it warned trading has not been as strong as expected in the period 
between October 27 and January 4, despite a strong Black Friday.
Superdry said there has been "unprecedented" promotional activity as well as subdued consumer demand post-
Christmas.
"These factors, combined with shortages of some better-selling product, driven by the need to reduce our inherited 
inventory position, adversely impacted our sales during peak trading," Superdry added. 
Retail sales have missed expectations by GBP23 million, the company continued, while wholesale operations have 
suffered a GBP5 million shortfall due to timing issues. 
As a result, Superdry now sees underlying pretax profit for its year ending April between zero and GBP10 million. 
The UK's exit from the EU moved a step closer after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit Bill cleared the House of 
Commons, the lower house of the UK parliament. The EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill was given a third reading by 
330 votes to 231, a majority of 99.
The comfortable victory for the UK prime minister followed the influx of new Tory MPs and is in marked contrast to 
the tortuous attempts to steer a Brexit bill through the Commons before the December general election.
The Bill, which paves the way for Brexit on January 31, will now go to the House of Lords – where it could face a 
more difficult passage as Johnson does not have a majority in the upper chamber.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices look set to open in the green on Friday in London, with investors digesting a new 
twist to events in the Middle East as well as progress in the US-China trade dispute. 
In the UK, Ryanair has boosted profit guidance after a strong festive period, while JD Sports reported encouraging 
trading and Mondi announced the departure of its chief executive. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 30.3 points higher at 5,628.42. The blue chip index closed up 
23.19 points, or 0.3% at 7,598.12 on Thursday. 
US President Donald Trump said Thursday he had "suspicions" about the crash of a Ukrainian airliner outside 
Tehran that killed all 176 people aboard, as US officials reported it had been mistakenly shot down by Iran.
Unnamed officials told US media that Iran fired two surface-to-air missiles at the aircraft as it took off on 
Wednesday morning, bringing it down in a blaze of flames before it exploded on the ground.
The US conclusion was reportedly based on satellite, radar and electronic data indicating a tragic error.
The disaster unfolded just hours after Tehran launched ballistic missiles at US military targets in Iraq to retaliate for 
the US drone strike in Baghdad last week that killed a top Iranian general.
ABC News said an unnamed official called the two-missile scenario "highly likely".
"They say a week is a long time in politics, and this week it's also been true for financial markets, given some of the 
hyperbolic talk of World War Three that was doing the rounds early on Monday morning," said Michael Hewson at 
CMC Markets UK.

Brent oil was quoted at USD65.30 a barrel early Friday, down from USD66.80 at the close Thursday. The price of 
oil touched USD70 shortly after the US killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, but it has since edged back as 
fears of war have receded. 
Negotiations for the second phase of a pending US-China trade deal will begin promptly but the outcome may wait 
until after this year's elections, Trump said Thursday.
Trump's remarks come days before Beijing's trade envoy is due in Washington to sign a "phase one" agreement, 
marking a pause in the two sides' nearly two-year trade war.
The US leader also openly cast doubt on whether American farmers would be able to supply China with the 
massive increases in agricultural exports expected to be part of the deal.
"We'll start right away negotiating phase two. It will take a little time," Trump told reporters.
Hewson added: "With this week's geopolitical risk subsiding as we head towards the weekend, investors now have 
the opportunity to focus on the signing of the signing of the new US, China phase one trade deal next week, as well 
as the health of the US economy today, and in particular the labour market which has continued to look resilient."
The US jobs report for December is at 1330 GMT. This follows a report that employment increased by more than 
expected in December, payroll processor ADP reported on Wednesday. 
In November, US non-farm payrolls showed a big 266,000 rise in jobs. 
In the US on Thursday Wall Street ended in the green, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 0.7%, the 
S&P 500 also up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite 0.8% higher.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index ended 0.5% higher on Friday. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed 0.1% 
lower, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.2%.
In early UK corporate news, budget airline Ryanair said trading was stronger than expected over the festive period, 
and as a result it has upped profit guidance. 
For its year ending March, the Irish carrier sees post-tax profit between EUR950 million to EUR1.05 billion, having 
previously guided for EUR800 million to EUR900 million. 
Ryanair said trading was boosted by better-than-expected close-in bookings over Christmas and New Year, while 
forward bookings to April are 1% higher year-on-year which will lead to higher-than-expected fares.
One downside for Ryanair is Laudamotion. The recently purchased Austrian airline is underperforming due to lower-
than-expected fares over the festive period. Fares are being hurt by intense competition in both Germany and 
Austria, Ryanair said. 
In the FTSE 100, paper and packaging firm Mondi said Chief Executive Peter Oswald is to leave the company at 
the end of March. He originally joined Mondi in 1992, and has been CEO since early 2017. 
Mondi has appointed Chief Financial Officer Andrew King as interim CEO whilst a replacement for Oswald is found, 
the company added. 
Sportswear firm JD Sports Fashion reiterated full-year guidance and reported "positive like-for-like trends" over the 
pivotal Christmas trading period, despite the UK retail market facing tricky conditions.
The company said full-year headline pretax profit, after removing the impact of IFRS 16, will fall in the "upper 
quartile" of market consensus range of GBP403 million and GBP433 million. This could represent a annual jump of 
as much as 27% from last year's pretax profit of GBP339.9 million. IFRS 16 governs the financial treatment of 
leases.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings raised its full-year guidance after a surprisingly positive Christmas period and said forward 
bookings for January to April have risen year-on-year. The Irish carrier upped its annual profit after tax guidance 
range to between EUR950 million and EUR1.1 billion, which could represent year-on-year hike of up to 19% from 
EUR885.0 million. It previously expected full-year profit after tax for the 12 months to March 31 to fall between the 
EUR800 million and EUR900 million range. In an unscheduled statement, the airline said the festive period was 
"characterised by higher than expected close-in bookings at better than expected yields".
----------
JD Sports Fashion reported a positive Christmas trading update, towering above some of its struggling counterparts 
in the UK retail market. The FTSE 100-listed company said its headline pretax profit for the year ending February 1, 
after removing the impact of IFRS 16, will fall in the "upper quartile" of market consensus range of GBP403 million 
and GBP433 million. This could represent a annual jump of as much as 27% from last year's pretax profit of 
GBP339.9 million. Conversely, struggling fashion outfit Superdry separately warned that it may not make a full-year 
profit after its Christmas trading period was compromised by subdued customer demand and stock shortages. 
Clothing and homewares seller also Joules warned that underlying pretax profit will be "significantly below" market 
expectations for its year to May, on the back of a difficult festive period. The company said online sales were 
"disappointing".

----------
Mondi said Chief Executive Peter Oswald is to step down from the board and leave the company at the end of 
March. Oswald was appointed as CEO in February 2017 following the departure of predecessor David Hathorn. He 
took up the role in May that year. The Vienna, Austria-based packaging and paper company will now begin the 
process of searching for a successor to Oswald. In the meantime, Chief Financial Officer Andrew King has agreed 
to take on the role of interim CEO.
----------
Boeing said it regrets the content of communications provided to US Congress and the Federal Aviation 
Administration about the grounded 737 MAX jet. The New York Times on Thursday reported that, in the 
communications, employees mocked federal rules and joked about potential flaws in the 737 MAX. In one set of 
messages, an employee, talking in 2017 about the MAX, said it had been designed by "clowns". The MAX has been 
grounded since mid-March following the second of the two fatal crashes that together claimed 346 lives. The NYT 
said one employee, in an exchange in 2018, before the first crash, said to another colleague: "Would you put your 
family on a Max simulator trained aircraft? I wouldn't."
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were mixed, with travel stocks higher across the board after Ryanair lifted profit guidance. Wall 
Street was set for a higher open with major stock indices pointed up 0.3% ahead of the US jobs report for 
December at 1330 GMT. Consensus is looking for 164,000 jobs to be added in December, down from 264,000 jobs 
the month before.
----------
FTSE 100: up 0.1% at 7,602.01
FTSE 250: down 0.2% at 21,622.66
AIM ALL-SHARE: flat at 953.60
GBP: unchanged from USD1.3062
EUR: soft at USD1.1093 (USD1.1100)
GOLD: flat at USD1,549.05 per ounce (USD1,550.20)
OIL (Brent): down at USD65.20 a barrel (USD65.41)
(changes since previous London equities close)
----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Iran's civil aviation chief denied Friday that a missile downed a Ukrainian airliner which crashed killing all 176 on 
board, dismissing claims of a catastrophic mistake by Tehran's air defences. The declaration at a press conference 
in the Iranian capital came after Britain and Canada pointed to what they said were signs of an accidental missile 
strike. "One thing is for certain, this airplane was not hit by a missile," Iran's civil aviation chief Ali Abedzadeh said. 
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Iran Denies Shooting Down Civilian Jet By Mistake
The Boeing 737 crashed on Wednesday shortly after Tehran launched missiles at US forces in Iraq in response to 
the killing of a top Iranian general in a US drone strike in Baghdad. It was Iran's worst civil aviation disaster since 
1988 when the US military said it shot down an Iran Air plane by mistake, killing all 290 people on board.
----------
A delegation from Canada is heading to Iran to help probe the crash of the Ukrainian airliner that had Iranian-
Canadian dual nationals on board, the Iranian foreign ministry said. "Based on the coordination between Iran and 
Canada's foreign ministries, a 10-person Canadian delegation is en route to Iran," the ministry said in a statement. 
The team will "handle the affairs of the Canadian victims" who died in the crash.
----------
The threat of beating war drums in Iran and Libya will focus minds later Friday when foreign ministers from the 28 
EU states meet in Brussels for crisis talks. European diplomats have been working overtime to calm international 
tensions surrounding the two countries. The US and Iran only just backed away from the risk of full-blown conflict 
this week after Washington took out a top Iranian military commander in Iraq and Tehran retaliated with strikes on 
military bases used by the US in Iraq. EU capitals are also hoping to keep alive the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, 
which they say is necessary for maintaining calm.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London were mixed at midday on Friday, with travel stocks in the green after 
Ryanair raised its annual profit guidance.
Ahead, investor attention will turn to the US jobs report for December in the afternoon. 
The FTSE 100 index was up 5.63 points, or 0.1% at 7,603.75. The FTSE 250 was down 36.64 points, or 0.2% at 
21,606.43, and the AIM All-Share was flat at 963.77.
The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.1% at 12,879.06, the Cboe UK 250 was down 0.2% at 19,497.44, and the Cboe Small 
Companies was down 0.3% at 12,391.42.
In Paris the CAC 40 was flat, while the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.2%. 
In the FTSE 100, airline operators International Consolidated Airlines and easyJet were the top two performers, up 
4.6% and 4.0% respectively, after peer Ryanair Holdings lifted profit guidance. 
Blue-chip holiday firm TUI was up 1.3% and FTSE 250 budget airline Wizz Air Holdings was up 5.6%.
Ryanair upped its annual profit after tax guidance range to between EUR950 million and EUR1.1 billion, which 
could represent year-on-year hike of up to 19% from EUR885.0 million. It previously expected full-year profit after 
tax for the 12 months to March 31 to fall between the EUR800 million and EUR900 million range. In an unscheduled 
statement, the airline said the festive period was "characterised by higher than expected close-in bookings at better 
than expected yields".
Further, Ryanair said forward bookings for January to April have risen year-on-year. The stock was up 7.0%.

"Since forming in the mid-80s Ryanair has kept costs in check by offering a no-frills service. It also flies from a mix 
of primary and less expensive secondary airports, using its size to negotiate favourable terms," commented 
Hargreaves Lansdown's Nick Hyett.
At the other end of the large cap index, Mondi was down 2.5%. The paper and packaging firm said Chief Executive 
Peter Oswald is to step down from the board and leave the company at the end of March.
Oswald was appointed as CEO in February 2017 following the departure of predecessor David Hathorn. He took up 
the role in May that year. Mondi will now begin the process of searching for a successor to Oswald. In the 
meantime, Chief Financial Officer Andrew King has agreed to take on the role of interim CEO.
In the FTSE 250, B&M European Value Retail was the worst performer, down 8.1%. The discount retailer reported 
that its sales in the run-up to Christmas grew at a slower pace than expected, with its UK unit facing "reduced 
shopper footfall and political uncertainty". 
In the 13 weeks to December 28, its third quarter, the company said revenue increased 9.0% to GBP1.19 billion 
from GBP1.09 billion last year. Its UK Stores delivered an 8.8% revenue rise to GBP957.4 million from GBP879.9 
million. On a like-for-like basis, the UK unit posted a 0.3% sales rise. 
B&M said like-for-like performance was hindered by the broader challenges faced by the UK retail market. B&M 
reported that it did not participate "in any early or unusual discounting activity over the quarter".
On AIM, Joules Group was down 21% after the clothing retailer said retail sales were significantly behind 
expectations because of a "disappointing" online sales performance. 
In a trading update for seven weeks to January 5, the seller of British countryside clothing said its retail sales were 
significantly behind expectations and decreased by 4.5%. In the same period a year ago, sales rose 11.7%. The 
company said this was a result of disappointing online sales performance due to an internally generated stock 
availability issue throughout the important end of season sale event, which has now been addressed. 
Joules said it expects second half cost headwinds as a result of US-China tariffs, which it expects to continue into 
next year. As a result, Joules warned underlying pretax profit will be "significantly below" market expectations for 
the financial year in May. For the 12 months to May 26, 2019, Joules had posted pretax profit of GBP12.9 million, 
15% higher year-on-year, with the underlying figure rising 19% to GBP15.5 million.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3060 at midday, flat against USD1.3062 at the London equities close Thursday.
The euro stood at USD1.1087 at midday, marginally lower than USD1.1100 late Thursday.
Against the yen, the dollar was trading at JPY109.63, up slightly from JPY109.50 late Thursday.
Stocks in New York were set for a higher open ahead of the US jobs report for December at 1330 GMT.
The DJIA was called up 0.2%, the S&P 500 index up 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite up 0.4%.
Consensus for the closely-watched nonfarm payrolls figure is for 164,000 jobs to be added in December, down from 
264,000 jobs the month before. The US unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.5%.
"It is clear the US labour market is in rude health, so the wages component will be of extra importance as 
realistically, the jobless rate is unlikely to fall much more without a rise in the earnings reading. If companies are 
struggling to fill vacancies they might have to offer higher wages to attract potential workers. A solid earnings 
reading should bode well for the economy as people who earn more tend to spend more - which drives the 
economy along," said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.      
Brent oil was quoted at USD65.41 a barrel at midday, unchanged from late Thursday.

Ryanair, up 6.8%. The Irish carrier raised its full-year guidance after a surprising Christmas period and said forward

International Consolidated Airlines, easyJet, TUI and Wizz Air were up 4.0%, 3.5%, 2.3% and 5.6% respectively. 
"The whole airline sector was rising in Ryanair's tailwind after a very encouraging update from the budget carrier. 
Investors' attention will always be grabbed by a big number and Ryanair has duly delivered, raising the upper end 
of its full year profit guidance above the EUR1 billion mark," AJ Bell's Russ Mould said.

Superdry, down 15%. The fashion retailer warned it may not make a full-year profit after its Christmas trading period 
was compromised by subdued customer demand and stock shortages. In the year to April 25, the company said 
underlying pretax profit is expected to be as low as zero, and has high as GBP10 million. This would be a sharp fall 
from GBP38.0 million last year, as struggles at the embattled high street brand continue. It made an underlying 
pretax loss of GBP2.3 million in the first-half of financial 2020. In the 10 weeks to January 4, group revenue shrunk 
by 16% year-on-year, driven by revenue in its bricks and mortar units falling by 19%. The period saw an annual 
revenue fall of 17% in the Wholesale division but declines in online sales were tempered at 9%, Superdry said. 
Retail sales, predominantly made online, in the period after Black Friday totalled GBP23 million, lower than 
expected.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened lower on Monday as investors fled equities and flocked to the 
dollar, oil and gold as tensions between the US and Iran intensified.
The FTSE 100's fall was not as steep as that of European counterparts due to its heavy weighting of oil and gold 
producers.
The UK flagship index index was down 32.06 points, or 0.4%, at 7,590.34. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index was down 
109.94 points at 21,878.25. The AIM All-Share index was down 0.3% at 961.41.
The Cboe UK 100 index was down 0.3% at 12,862.39. The Cboe 250 was down 0.2% at 19,837.61 and the Cboe 
Small Companies flat at 12,294.02
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.7% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt 1.0% lower in opening trade.
US President Donald Trump warned of a "major retaliation" against Tehran after it threatened revenge for the killing 
Friday of commander Qasem Soleimani.
Iran announced on Sunday a further rollback of its commitments to its nuclear accord, while Iraq's parliament 
demanded the departure of US troops from the country as fallout from the attack spread.
On the London Stock Exchange, Russian gold miner Polymetal International was the best blue-chip performer, up 
1.7% tracking spot gold prices higher. Midcap peers Fresnillo and Hochschild Mining were up 0.9%.
Gold was quoted at USD1,576.60 an ounce Monday morning, sharply higher than USD1,549.40 late Friday. The 
precious metal was trading at its highest levels since mid-2013 as demand for safe-haven assets increased.
Shares in oil majors also were among the handful of blue-chip risers as oil prices rose. Royal Dutch Shell 'A' and 'B' 
shares were up 1.5% and 1.2% respectively, while BP was up 1.6%.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Oil And Gold Stocks Rise, Travel Operators Slump
Shell is London's biggest company by market capitalisation, while BP is third biggest. 
Oil was quoted at USD70.02 a barrel, up from USD68.11 late Friday. The North Sea benchmark touched an 
overnight high of USD70.72 - its highest level since May.
Travel stocks were suffering with easyJet down 2.6%, British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines 
down 2.7%, and Ryanair Holdings down 3.5%. Tour operator TUI was down 1.9%.
The threat of war reduces the appetite for travel, while higher oil prices feed through to higher jet fuel costs for 
airlines.
Eastern and central Europe-focused carrier Wizz Air Holdings was down 2.1%. Wizz Air reported a double-digit rise 
in passenger traffic for December.
For the recent month, the FTSE 250 airline reported a capacity increase of 24% to 3.7 million from 3.0 million a year 
before, while passengers increased by 25% to 3.3 million from 2.7 million.
As a result, load factor improved to 89.4% from 88.8%.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals was the worst FTSE 100 performer, down 4.8% after JPMorgan downgraded the 
drugmaker to Underweight from Neutral,
WM Morrison Supermarkets was down 2.9% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut the supermarket chain to 
Underperform from Neutral. The grocer will release a trading update on Tuesday, followed by peers J Sainsbury 
and Tesco on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. 
German rival Aldi sold 55 million mince pies over a Christmas which saw British shoppers spend record amounts at 
the chain. UK sales in the four weeks to December 24 topped GBP1 billion for the first time in the company's 
history, and marked a 7.9% rise on the same period in 2018, Aldi revealed.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3080 early Monday, lower than USD1.3092 late Friday.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to assemble key ministers on Monday to discuss the spiralling crisis in the 
Middle East after the US's assassination of Iran's top military leader.
After speaking to the US President on Sunday, Johnson broke his silence to say the UK "will not lament" the death 
of the leader who he said was "a threat to all our interests".
The euro was quoted at USD1.1160 early Monday, lower than USD1.1177 late Friday.
Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at JPY108.15, firm against JPY107.93 late Friday.
The economic calendar on Monday has services PMI readings from Germany at 0855 GMT, eurozone at 0900 
GMT and UK at 0930 GMT.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 1.9%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed flat, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong closed down 0.8%.
China's services sector reported a reasonable rise in new work in December, data from Caixin showed on Monday.
The Chinese December services purchasing managers' index was 52.5, from 53.5 in November. This means the 
services sector remains in expansion, though the rate of growth has eased.
A reading of 50.0 indicates no change, and a figure below that implies contraction.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening lower on Friday as oil and safe-haven assets surged 
overnight after an Iranian general was killed by the US military.
Balancing this was a positive Christmas trading update from bellwether home and fashion retailer Next, while 
cigarette company BAT welcomed US restrictions on vaping that were less severe than feared by the industry.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index will open 28.06 points lower at 7,580.00. The FTSE 100 index closed up 
65.62 points, or 0.9%, at 7,608.06 on Thursday, the first trading day in 2020.
In early UK company news, Next upped its annual profit guidance and said it expects further improvement in 
financial 2021 after fourth-quarter performance came in ahead of internal forecasts.
The FTSE 100-listed retailer reported that total full price sales - which include interest income - grew by 5.2% on a 
year before in the period from October 27 to December 28. Next said the result was 1.1% ahead of its internal 
forecasts.
"We believe our sales performance in the period was helped by a much colder November than last year and 
improved stock availability in both our Retail stores and Online," Next said in its statement Friday.
Therefore, Next increased its pretax profit guidance for the financial year to the end of January by GBP2 million to 
GBP727 million, which will represent a 0.6% growth on last year. Next said it expects full price sales growth of 3.9% 
in financial 2020, which is 0.3 percentage point ahead of its guidance given in October.
Irish budget carrier Ryanair said traffic in the month of December grew by 9% to 11.2 million passengers compared 
to 10.3 million carried a year earlier. For the year as a whole, the number of passengers it carried also increased by 
9%, to 140.2 million. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Next Ups Guidance; BAT Gets Clarity On E-Cigs
British American Tobacco welcomed regulations announced on Thursday by the US Food & Drug Administration, 
saying they acknowledged that a properly regulated vapour category provides a credible alternative to smoking. 
However, the regulator addressed the important issue of preventing the access and appeal of vapour products to 
youth, BAT said.
The FDA said Thursday that cartridge-based e-cigarettes in flavours other than tobacco or menthol will become 
illegal unless specifically authorised by the government. BAT said this regulatory clarity is expected to return the US 
vapour market to stability, following a period of "disruption and uncertainty".
Back in September, some US states banned flavoured e-cigarettes, which have been available in the country since 
2006, amid an outbreak of severe pulmonary disease that has killed seven people and sickened hundreds.
The move followed the announcement from US President Donald Trump's administration that it would soon ban 
flavoured e-cigarette products to stem a rising tide of youth users.
On Friday, BAT said the guidance from US FDA is clear that flavours can return to the market place once they have 
been cleared through the premarket tobacco application process.
PMTA is an application that must be reviewed and approved by the FDA before a new tobacco product can be 
legally marketed in the US.
"Our US subsidiary, RAI Group, has already submitted one brand PMTA for VUSE Solo and is well positioned to 
submit applications for the remaining VUSE portfolio ahead of the deadline of May 2020. We are confident that, as 
required by the PMTA process, all VUSE products will be shown to be appropriate for the protection of public 
health," said BAT Chief Executive Jack Bowles. 
In the US on Thursday, Wall Street ended at new highs, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 300 
points or 1.2%. The S&P 500 closed up 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.3%.
Financial markets in Japan remain closed for the New Year's holiday. In China, the Shanghai Composite index 
ended down 0.1%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.4% in late trade.
"Overnight, stocks in Asia fell on the back of the news that an Iranian military commander was killed in Iraq by US 
airstrikes. Tensions in the region sent oil surging too," said CMC Markets UK Market Analyst David Madden. 
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened the US with "harsh retaliation" after the killing of 
influential Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, Iranian state television reported on Friday.
Soleimani is the Commander of Iran's Quds Force, a unit in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Soleimani's path 
would continue without him, but the perpetrators would face severe revenge, Khamenei said.
The Defense Department in Washington confirmed earlier that Soleimani was killed in an attack near Baghdad 
airport in the early hours of Friday, in what the US described as "defensive action" strikes.
Soleimani was killed along with with the deputy head of Iraq's powerful Shiite Hashd Shaabi militia, Abu Mahdi al-
Mohandes, the group said.
Oil prices surged in response. Brent was trading at USD68.30 a barrel early Friday, up 3.9% from USD65.76 at the 
London equities close on Thursday.
Gold, traditionally a safe-haven investment, jumped to USD1,540.70 an ounce, up 0.8% from USD1,527.98 late 
Thursday.
"The US dollar rebounded yesterday, but in late December the currency dropped to a five month low, so bargain 
hunters entered the fold," added Madden.

Sterling was quoted at USD1.3108 early Friday, soft on USD1.3155 at the London equities close on Thursday.
In other currencies, the euro was trading at USD1.1157 early Friday, soft on USD1.1185 late Thursday. Against the 
yen, the dollar was at JPY108.03, down slightly from JPY108.33.
In UK economic news, house price growth decelerated in December, Nationwide reported. House prices in 
December grew 0.1% on November, after November had risen 0.5% on October.
On an annual basis however, house prices increased by 1.4%, accelerating from the 0.8% year-on-year rise 
recorded in November.
"Annual UK house price growth edged up as 2019 drew to a close, with prices 1.4% higher than December 2018, 
the first time it been above 1% for 12 months," said Nationwide Chief Economist Robert Gardner. 
Looking at house prices regionally, London was the weakest performing region. Prices fell 1.8% in the last quarter 
of 2019 from a year before, with the outer south-east falling 1.0%.
All other regions of the UK posted a rise in house prices. Scotland was the strongest, at 2.8% year-on-year in the 
fourth quarter, with the West Midlands next with 2.7% and the North at 2.6%.
The economic events calendar on Friday has UK construction PMI at 0930 GMT.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Friday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Next upped its annual profit guidance and said it expects further improvement in financial 2021 after fourth-quarter 
performance came in ahead of internal forecasts. The FTSE 100-listed home and fashion retailer reported that total 
full price sales - which include interest income - grew by 5.2% on a year before in the period from October 27 to

British American Tobacco welcomed a move by US regulators to ban a number of e-cigarette products. The US 
Food & Drug Administration on Thursday said cartridge-based e-cigarettes in flavours other than tobacco or 
menthol will become illegal unless specifically authorised by the government. However, in September the White 
House had promised a full ban, but this was scuppered by industry pressure. The change will take effect in early 
February, outlawing cartridges with fruit, mint and candy flavours, which are particularly popular with young people. 
The ban will exempt large, tank-based rechargeable vaping devices, however, which are primarily sold in vape

shops that cater to adults. BAT said the FDA move shows vaping remains a credible alternative to smoking, and 
welcomed the clarity the new ruling gives. BAT has already submitted one brand application for vaping products, 
and has several more lined up before the deadline of May this year.
----------
Ryanair Holdings posted a strong increase in traffic for December, including notable growth from its Lauda unit. 
Irish budget airline's total traffic for the final month of 2019 was 11.2 million passengers, which represented an 8.7% 
increase from the previous year's figure of 10.3 million. This included a 67% rise in Lauda passengers to 500,000 
from 300,000. Ryanair reported its group load factor for December as being 95%, flat from the same month of 2018 
but below the rolling annual figure of 96%.
----------
Bovis Homes Group said it has completed its acquisition of two Galliford Try businesses and has applied to change 
its name to Vistry Group. Back in November, Galliford agreed to sell its Linden Homes and Partnerships & 
Regeneration units to Bovis in a deal worth a combined GBP1.14 billion. This includes Bovis's issue of 63.7 million 
new shares to Galliford plus GBP300 million in cash and the assumption of Galliford's GBP100 million 10-year 
private debt placement. Further to the November announcement that Bovis would be changing its name as part of 
its integration with the acquired businesses, Bovis said it has applied to change its name to Vistry Group - both for 
its housebuilding and its partnerships businesses. The enlarged business will operate with both the Linden Homes 
and Bovis Homes brands. Bovis Chief Executive Greg Fitzgerald said: "The combination of these businesses with 
Bovis Homes creates a top five housebuilder in the UK with the capacity to deliver over 12,000 homes per year in 
the medium term."
----------
Marks & Spencer Group said it has appointed David Surdeau as interim chief financial officer to replace Humphrey 
Singer, whose departure was announced in mid-September. Later, in October, M&S had confirmed that Singer 
would leave at the end of 2019. M&S said Surdeau will begin his new role on Tuesday next week and will report to 
Chief Executive Officer Steve Rowe. Surdeau was group planning, treasury & tax director of Tesco for over 16 
years. 
----------
MARKETS
----------
Stocks were lower in London in a quiet day for UK company news, as rising tensions in the Middle East dented the 
risk appetite of investors but gold and oil prices a boost. Wall Street closed at record highs on Thursday but is set to 
give up these gains on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average called 1.3% lower, S&P 500 seen down 1.4% 
and the Nasdaq Composite down 1.7%.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened the US with "harsh retaliation" after the killing of 
influential Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, Iranian state television reported. Soleimani's path would continue 
without him, but the perpetrators would face severe revenge, Khamenei said. Soleimani's death would not affect 
what he termed Islam's final victory over "the imperialists," Khamenei said in remarks carried on state television. 
Khamenei also declared three days of national mourning. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Tehran 
to protest against American "crimes", an AFP correspondent reported. The Defense Department in Washington 
confirmed that Soleimani was killed in a drone attack near Baghdad airport in the early hours of Friday, in what the 
US described as a "defensive action". Soleimani was killed along with with the deputy head of Iraq's powerful Shiite 
Hashd Shaabi militia, Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes, the group said. Part of the 750 forces from the US 82nd Airborne 
division dispatched to the region a few days ago had already arrived in Baghdad, a US defense official told AFP.
----------
UK construction output reduced sharply in December, the latest IHS Markit-Chartered Institute of Procurement & 
Supply purchasing managers' index showed, amid political uncertainty and subdued client demand ahead of the 
general election held last month. At 44.4 in December - down from 45.3 in November - the headline seasonally 
adjusted IHS Markit/CIPS UK construction total activity index was below the 50.0 no-change mark for the eighth 
consecutive month. This period of falling business activity across the construction sector is the longest recorded by 
IHS Markit for almost a decade, it said. "Brexit uncertainty and spending delays ahead of the general election were 
once again the most commonly cited factors highlighted by firms experiencing a drop in construction activity," said 
IHS Markit Economics Associate Director Tim Moore. 
----------
UK shop prices continued to decline in December as discounts deepened and began earlier amid retailers' efforts to 
keep customers shopping, the British Retail Consortium-Nielsen Shop Price Index showed. The BRC-Nielsen 
Index, covering the first week of December, showed annual shop prices were flat in December compared with 
November. On a year-on-year basis, prices were down 0.4% in December. "Shop prices continued to fall in 
December as receding inflationary pressures, weak consumer demand and intense competition combined to keep 
price increases at bay. 2019 has been a particularly challenging year, with historically weak sales growth," said 
BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson. Looking ahead, BRC's Dickinson said future upward pressures on shop 
prices are expected amid movements in global food prices, but the highest risk to prices remains the outcome of 
Brexit negotiations. 
----------
House price growth in the UK decelerated in December, Nationwide reported. House prices in December grew 
0.1% on November, after November had risen 0.5% on October. On an annual basis however, house prices 
increased by 1.4%, accelerating from the 0.8% year-on-year rise recorded in November. "Annual UK house price 
growth edged up as 2019 drew to a close, with prices 1.4% higher than December 2018, the first time it been above 
1% for 12 months," said Nationwide Chief Economist Robert Gardner. Looking at house prices regionally, London 
was the weakest performing region. Prices fell 1.8% in the last quarter of 2019 from a year before, with the outer 
south-east falling 1.0%.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday warned traffic growth will suffer and it will be forced to close 
two more bases due to lower than expected number of Boeing Co's B737 MAX aircraft deliveries.
Shares in the company were 1.4% higher at EUR13.78 each in London on Wednesday afternoon.
Ryanair said it now expects to receive just 10 MAX aircraft rather than 20 as previously predicted.
The Irish budget airline said that as a result of the aircraft delivery delays, it has cut its traffic growth forecast for the 
year to March 31, 2021, by 0.6% to 156 million passengers from 157 million. 
Receiving just half the 737 MAX aircraft means Ryanair will also close two more bases in summer 2020, in 
Nuremberg, Germany, and Stockholm Skavsta, located roughly 100 kilometres from the Swedish capital. 
In August, Spanish trade union Sindical Obrera said Ryanair would close its bases in Las Palmas, Tenerife South, 
Lanzarote and Girona from January 2020.
Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft was grounded in March following a pair of deadly crashes that killed 346 people. On 
Tuesday, the aircraft manufacturer was dealt a further blow after US carrier United Airlines Inc ordered 50 new 
long-haul jets from European rival Airbus SE.
Ryanair added: "We also expect to cut summer capacity in a number of other existing bases, and we are currently 
in discussions with our people, our unions, and our affected airports to finalise these minor reductions."
Over the course of 2019, the carrier was mired in strikes, with industrial action being taken in August. Strikes were 
also scheduled for the end of September, but were called off. 
Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair-branded unit, said: "We regret these two further base closures and minor 
capacity cuts at other bases which are solely due to further delivery delays to our Boeing MAX aircraft. We are

continuing to work with Boeing, our people, our unions and our affected airports to minimise these capacity cuts and 
job losses."
On Tuesday, Ryanair said group traffic rose by 5.8% in November to 11.0 million from 10.4 million in the 
comparative period.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC and Hungarian FTSE 250 carrier Wizz Air Holdings PLC on 
Tuesday reported a year-on-year rise in passenger traffic for the month of November.
The Irish carrier said group traffic rose by 5.8% to 11.0 million from 10.4 million in November 2018. The figure

On a rolling annual basis, group traffic has grown 9.0% to 151.6 million from 139.1 million.
Wizz Air reported a November capacity increase of 27% to 3.2 million from 2.6 million. Load factor increased to 
92.8% from 91.2%.
November passengers rose by 25% to 3.0 million from 2.4 million last year.
Available seat kilometres was up by 21% to 5.2 million from 4.3 million and revenue passenger kilometres grew by 
4.9 million from 3.9 million in November 2018.
On a rolling annual basis, capacity is up 15% to 41.8 million, total passengers up by 17% to 39.1 million with load 
factor up 1.3 percentage points to 93.6%.
During November, the Hungarian carrier added 11 new routes, which included 4 in Poland, 2 in Ukraine and 1 in the

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening marginally higher on Tuesday following a lower close on 
Monday, despite the US threatening new import tariffs on European goods.
In company news plumbing and heating products supplier Ferguson said the demerger of its UK operations is on 
track, and movie house chain Cineworld Group warned annual trading will miss expectations on delayed movie 
releases.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 8.36 points higher at 7,294.30. The large-cap index closed down 
60.59 points, or 0.8%, at 7,285.94 on Monday.
For the first quarter ended October 31, Ferguson said revenue was up 5.3% to USD5.21 billion from USD4.95 in the 
first quarter last year. Trading profit, which excludes exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets, came in at USD451 million, up 9.2% from USD413 million the year before.
In the US, revenue was up 6.2% to USD4.89 billion from USD4.61 billion in the first quarter last year.
Ferguson said its demerger of Wolseley UK is on track and expects to complete the process in 2020.
"We expect to make further good progress in the year ahead. While US market growth is currently broadly flat. we 
remain confident of outperforming our end markets and our order books support continued modest revenue growth 
in the months ahead. This strong focus on growth with continued cost and margin discipline gives us confidence in 
our expectations for the full year, which remain unchanged," Chief Executive Officer Kevin Murphy said.
Cineworld Group said trading for the full year is expected to be slightly below management's expectations amid a 
weaker box office performance.
For the period January 1 to December 1, Cineworld said revenue was down 9.7%, with the box office performance - 
the money it makes from ticket admissions - down 13%. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Cineworld Warns On Weak Box Office Performance
"As anticipated, the box office performance for the reported period was slower than the comparative period in 2018 
reflecting the phasing of major releases and postponement of some highly anticipated movies to 2020," the 
company said.
Cineworld said the integration plans for US cinema operator Regal Entertainment have progressed well, and it 
announced an increase in synergies to USD190 million from USD150 million. 
"The impact of the major releases in December is expected to continue the recent positive box office trend. 
However given the weaker full year box office, partially offset by strong execution of synergies and revenue 
initiatives, management expects trading for the full year to be slightly below management's expectations," the 
company said. 
Ryanair Holdings reported a 6% rise in November traffic to 11 million passengers from 10.4 million at group level, 
with a load factor of 96%. On a rolling annual basis, group traffic grew 9% to 151.6 million passengers from 139.1 
million.
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended sharply lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.0%, S&P 
500 down 0.9% and Nasdaq Composite down 1.1%.
The US is considering slapping additional tariffs on European products as part of the long-running feud between 
Washington and Brussels over subsidies to airplane manufacturers.
"The US is initiating a process to assess increasing the tariff rates and subjecting additional European Union 
products to the tariffs," the US Trade Representative's office said.
The USTR announcement came after the World Trade Organization found that the EU had not taken "appropriate 
steps to remove the adverse effects" of its aid to Airbus.
The WTO previously declared European subsidies for Airbus illegal and then allowed the US to hit back with tariffs 
on EU imports to be able to recoup up to USD7.5 billion in damages.
The US also threatened to impose tariffs of up to 100% on USD2.4 billion in French goods in retaliation for a digital 
services tax it says is discriminatory.
French sparkling wine, yogurt and Roquefort cheese are on the list of goods that could be targeted as soon as mid-
January after a report from the US Trade Representative's office found the tax penalizes American tech companies 
such as Alphabet's Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.com.
CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said: "The big question now is whether the US really means what it says, or 
whether this will be just another occasion when the US talks tough, only to back away at the last minute. If history is 
any guide the Europeans are likely to find US crosshairs start to move increasingly their way, the closer to next 
year's US election we get.
"Unsurprisingly, Asia markets haven't reacted well to the weaker closes in Europe and the US, however given that 
they were only playing catch-up, European markets still look as if they might open slightly higher this morning."
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.6%. In China, the Shanghai Composite ended up 0.3%, but the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.2%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2941 early Tuesday, firm against USD1.2933 at the London equities close 
Monday.
The euro was quoted at USD1.1075, down from USD1.1086 late Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was trading at 
JPY109.16, up from JPY109.03 late Monday.
Brent oil was quoted at USD61.04 early Tuesday, down from USD61.44 late Monday.

In other commodities, gold was quoted at USD1,460.07 early Tuesday, lower than USD1,463.74 late Monday.
The economic events calendar on Tuesday has UK construction PMI data at 0930 GMT and eurozone producer 
prices at 1000 GMT.

(Alliance News) - Credit Suisse maintained its positive stance on International Consolidated Airlines Group, 
upgraded Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa on improving prospects and turned downbeat on Air France-KLM.
Credit Suisse analysts Neil Glynn and Arthur Truslove said the global airline sector is a "highly cyclical space" and 
the performance is typically influenced by sentiment towards global demand developments.
"European carrier margins have fallen through 2019, in contrast to those in the US and global margins. Margin 
degradation has had a material impact on confidence in the sector, and for Lufthansa in particular. In our view, the 
key questions for the respective investment cases of the top five European airlines revolve around the prospects for 
margins, returns and cash flows to improve from here," Glynn and Truslove said.
The analysts said that a weak macroeconomic momentum often drives outperformance by high-margin operators.
"In 2018, when US ISM new orders sank from 67 to 51, IAG outperformed the sector, with RYA challenged by the 
new unionisation of its labour force. easyJet was the second strongest performer, ahead of Ryanair, then Air France 
KLM and Lufthansa, which lost the 2017 gains quickly as macro confidence deteriorated," the analysts said as an 
example.
Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating on International Consolidated Airlines saying the British Airways 
parent offers strong free cash flow generation and "the most undervalued major European airline".
The Swiss bank raised its price target to 727 pence from 665p. IAG shares were down 1.1% at 556.00p in London 
on Friday.
"The Capital Markets Day confirmed that management continues to expect unit costs to come down 1% annually 
over the medium term, despite lower capacity growth, and the preliminary pilot agreement reached by BA de-risks 
the picture somewhat. This leads us to reduce our ex-fuel unit cost assumptions from flat yoy over the medium term 
to -1%," Glynn and Truslove noted.

Last week, British Airways agreed to a provisional pay settlement with its pilots, heading off the threat of Christmas 
disruption and bringing to an end one of the most damaging disputes in its history.
The pilots union, Balpa, recommended a deal worth 12% over three years to its members, more than a year after 
talks started and following strikes in September that cost the airline tens of millions of pounds a day. The deal also 
offers improvements to working conditions, including rosters.
The analysts also believe a higher dividend payout ratio seems likely in 2019 and the company faces fewer risks 
over the longer term.
"We see 2020 as lower risk, with IAG planning on growing only 3.2% through the year, and history suggests that it 
may moderate this growth rate as the year advances. We think IAG may raise its dividend payout ratio with financial 
2019 results, and see a 35% to 40% payout ratio as feasible vs 25% now, given implied net income/levered FCF 
conversion of 50-60% over 2020E-22E with annual pension top ups down from GBP500 million to GBP700 million 
over the past four years to GBP450 million over 2020-22," the pair said.
Credit Suisse reiterated its Underperform rating on Ryanair Holdings saying the Irish carrier's biggest test will come 
when its growth plans come into effect.
The Swiss bank raised its price target to EUR12.24 from EUR11.32. The stock was down 0.5% at EUR13.90 on 
Friday.
"We remain encouraged by the prospect of Ryanair not growing capacity in summer 2020, but remain concerned 
about the potential to achieve EUR10 per passenger net income if the number of aircraft grows to 585 and 200 
million passengers by 2024," the pair said.
Credit Suisse upgraded Deutsche Lufthansa to Outperform from Neutral saying the German carrier can get back on 
track in 2020 following a challenging 2019. 
The Swiss bank raised its price target to EUR20.25 from EUR16.24. The stock was up 0.4% at EUR17.23 in 
Frankfurt.
"Our upgrade is based on our earnings increases, with adjusted EBIT up 6-7% over 2019E-2020E, and our target 
price up 25% to EUR20.25. Lufthansa is the airline with the weakest 2019 unit revenue performance (-2% yoy at 
constant currency for Network Airlines, providing the easiest 2020 comps) with the sharpest capacity reductions in 
its key markets," Glynn and Truslove said.
Credit Suisse cut Air France-KLM to Underperform from Neutral saying the Franco-Dutch carrier's shares offer 
short-term downside risk.
The bank cut its price target to EUR8.85 from EUR9.37. The stock was down 1.3% at EUR10.76 in Paris on Friday.
In September, the airline said: "close-in bookings in the peak travel period are weaker than foreseen in view of 
softening macro-economic environment."
In November, Air France-KLM unveiled an ambitious five-year plan aimed at reinventing itself to regain a leadership 
position among European airlines.
"Our forecasts indicate 2-6% upside potential at easyJet, IAG, and Ryanair for 2020 (2021 for Ryanair). However, 
we are concerned that Air France-KLM estimates will need to reset lower (again) before the market can focus more 
cleanly on the medium-term potential from management's new restructuring plan," the pair said.

(Alliance News) - Vodafone Group PLC has secured a seven-year technology partnership with Ryanair Holdings 
PLC to handle services including online booking, passenger boarding and in-flight transactions for the Irish airline in 
Europe, Reuters reported early on Wednesday. 
As par of the deal, the FTSE 100-listed telecommunications firm will help budget airline to "speed up" the time it 
takes to connect a new airport or site for use. It should also lead to a faster turnaround of planes, the news agency 
reported.

(Alliance News) - easyJet is still feeling the effects from a "torrid" year, but its rallying share price is driving a 
potential FTSE 100 re-entry and a new business launch gives the budget airline many a reason to be positive. 
"easyJet is fighting back after a torrid year which brought a tough trading environment and which culminated in 
relegation from the FTSE100 in June,"  Interactive Investor's Head of Markets Richard Hunter said
He continued: "More broadly, easyJet has recognised some inevitable weakness in consumer confidence, given the 
hazy economic outlook delivered by Brexit uncertainty and now compounded by the imminent general election."
Hunter added that some of the firm's "battle scars" remain. easyJet's pretax profit for the year to September 30 was 
3.4% lower at GBP430 million, with the headline figure dipping 26% to GBP427 million, though towards the top of 
its guidance. 
Revenue was 8.3% higher at GBP6.39 billion, with passenger numbers rising 8.6% to 96.1 million. Passenger 
revenue edged higher by 6.9% year-on-year, helped by strike troubles at IAG's British Airways, and Irish carrier 
Ryanair.  
Hunter added: "Some of the battle scars are evident. Adjusted pre-tax profit fell 26%, revenues per seat declined 
1.8% and the load factor also dipped to 91.5%. Meanwhile, return on capital employed decreased by over 3% and 
the overall dividend for the year was reduced by 25%.
"Ultimately, but positively, the disappointment of the first half of the year's trading was largely undone by the 
strength of the second half. This has been reflected in a share price which has climbed 29% over the last three 
months. Indeed, if the shares can maintain this altitude they are a shoo-in for retaining their FTSE 100 status in the 
December reshuffle."
easyJet slipped out of the FTSE 100 after an index re-jib in June. 
Shares in the company were 3.9% higher at 1,327.48 pence each in London on Tuesday morning.
IN THE KNOW: easyJet Still Scarred But Promotion Chances Sky High
easyJet will be paying a dividend of 43.9p per share, meaning a 25% cut from the year before
The company also announced the launch of a new Holidays business as well as a plan to make all flights net zero 
carbon, both from Tuesday.
The Holidays business push takes advantage of the recent demise of travel firm Thomas Cook, while easyJet said 
the environmental measure will cost it about GBP25 million in its new financial year.
Brewin Dolphin Investment Manager Arlene Ewing said: "Turbulence in the airline industry has been a source of 
opportunity for easyJet, which has been able to take over new take-off and landing slots that once belonged to 
Thomas Cook." 
"The proposed dividend of 43.9p is a reduction of more than 14% on last year, but as easyJet announces that it 
plans to move further into the package holiday market, the diversification in its offering means it continues to look 
profitable," she continued. 
Share Center analysis added: "With the budget airline boasting one of the strongest balance sheets, today's 
announcement of the revival of its package holiday business and plans to address carbon emissions are sure to 
please investors. 
"In addition, with record customers flying this financial year, cost cutting making progress and improving revenue 
per seat throughout the second-half of the year, the future does not look as dreary as once seemed."

(Alliance News) - Budget airline easyJet PLC reported a "strong" end to its recent financial year on Tuesday, with 
financial results meeting expectations. 
The company also announced a new Holidays business as well as a plan to make all flights net zero carbon, both 
from Tuesday. 
The Holidays business push takes advantage of the recent demise of travel firm Thomas Cook, while easyJet said 
the environmental measure will cost it about GBP25 million in its new financial year.
easyJet's pretax profit for the year to September was 3.4% lower at GBP430 million, with the headline figure 
dipping 26% to GBP427 million. This is towards the top of the guided range of GBP420 million to GBP430 million, 
for headline pretax profit. 
easyJet will be paying a dividend of 43.9 pence per share, meaning a 25% cut from the year before. It does make 
any returns at the half-year stage. 
Revenue was 8.3% higher at GBP6.39 billion, with passenger numbers rising 8.6% to 96.1 million. easyJet said 
revenue growth was also helped by a 10% increase in capacity.
The load factor declined to 91.5% from 92.9%. This is a measure of how many available seats a transport operator, 
such as an airline or rail company, fills. 
The company's revenue per seat, however, declined by 1.8% due to weaker consumer confidence in the UK, 
though this was offset by "self-help initiatives" as well as strikes at rivals Ryanair Group Holdings PLC and British 
Airways, which is owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA. 
TOP NEWS: easyJet Launches New Holidays Business After "Strong" Finish
The cost per seat on a headline basis rose 1.5% due to higher fuel costs and foreign exchange movements. 
easyJet delivered GBP139 million of cost savings during the year, it added. 
"easyJet finished the 2019 financial year with a strong performance across the business and a record summer," 
said Chief Executive Johan Lundgren.
"More customers than ever are coming to easyJet as their airline of choice, with a record 96.1 million customers 
flying with us this year. Our self-help initiatives meant we have been able reduce costs and drive a better yield 
performance which has improved revenue per seat in the second half of the year."
easyJet on Tuesday also announced a new business, easyJet Holidays, which will offer beach and city holidays 
across the airline's network. It expects this to launch by Christmas in the UK and be "at least" breakeven in its new 
financial year. 
"I am really thrilled that with the launch, before Christmas, of our brand new easyJet Holidays business we are 
bringing flexibility and excellent value to the holiday market," said Lundgren.
"We are now able to offer our customers more than 100 amazing beach and city holiday destinations, pairing 
Europe's best short-haul flight network with more than 5,000 of Europe's best hotels. We believe there is a gap in 
the market for a modern, relevant and flexible business for today's consumer," he continued.
Looking forward on the trading front, easyJet said forward bookings for the first half of its new financial year are 
"reassuring", and are slightly ahead year-on-year. Capacity growth is expected at the lower end of easyJet's 3% to 
8% historically guided range. 
Headline revenue per seat at constant currency for the first half ending March is expected to rise by low to mid-
single digits. The headline cost per seat, excluding fuel, at constant currency for the entire year is guided to rise by 
low single-digits. 
Shares in the FTSE 250 airline were 3.1% higher in early trade in London on Tuesday at 1,315.96 pence each.

(Alliance News) - Stocks in London were higher early Tuesday despite some jitters on the US and China trade war 
front, with Halma heading the FTSE 100 after lifting its interim payout and investors flocking to Homeserve after it 
unveiled a new acquisition. 
The FTSE 100 was up 23.41 points, or 0.3% higher, at 7,331.11.
The FTSE 250 was up 84.98 points, or 0.4%, to 20,525.48, and the AIM All-Share was up 0.2% at 895.89.
The Cboe UK 100 index was 0.6% higher at 12,452.69. The Cboe UK 250 was 0.6% higher at 18,488.17 and the 
Cboe UK Small Companies was up 0.1% at 11,293.84.
FTSE 100-listed Melrose Industries said it is trading in line with expectations in 2019, though two of its units have 
been hurt by the recent General Motors strike in the US.
Sales in the industrial turnaround firm's Automotive unit were down 5% year-on-year in the period to from July 1 to 
October 31, and its Powder Metallurgy saw a 13% sales decline, both feeling the bite from the GM strike action.
Nearly 50,000 GM workers downed tools in mid-September, launching the biggest labour dispute to hit the 
automaker in more than a decade. The strike ended in October after a 40-day walkout.
Melrose said sales in the Aerospace division, part of most recent big acquisition GKN, were up more than 5% in the 
recent four months on a year before, together with "good margin improvement".
Hazard detection and life protection technology manufacturer Halma led the way in the FTSE 100 early on 
Tuesday. It was 6.6% up after it edged its dividend higher, having delivered first half earnings growth.
The firm posted a 12% revenue rise to GBP653.7 million, with pretax profit rising 12% to GBP105.8 million.

Halma proposed a 6.54 pence per share interim payout, 7.0% up from 6.11p last year.
Just behind Halma were Intertek, 3.5% higher, after Jefferies upped its rating from Buy to Hold, and Meggitt, up 
2.0%, after securing a USD130 million defence contract.
Meggitt will supply fuel bladders to the Defense Logistics Agency in Philadelphia, a combat support agency in the 
US Department of Defense. 
Budget airline easyJet was 1.3% higher after said its full-year results were in line with expectations. 
Revenue increased by 8.3% to GBP6.39 billion, pretax profit fell by 3.4% to GBP445 million from GBP430 million 
however. Passenger revenue was 6.9% higher with the firm saying it benefited from strike action at IAG-owned flag 
carrier British Airways and Ryanair.
easyJet said headline costs, excluding fuel were 10% higher at GBP4.54 billion.
Headline pretax profit was down 26% to GBP427 million, though it was towards the top end of its GBP420 million to 
GBP430 million guidance range.
Looking ahead, easyJet said forward bookings for the first half of the 2020 financial year are "reassuring", slightly 
ahead of last year's levels.
The company also announced a new Holidays business as well as a plan to make all flights net zero carbon, both 
from Tuesday.
The Holidays business push takes advantage of the recent demise of travel firm Thomas Cook, while easyJet said 
the environmental measure will cost it about GBP25 million in its new financial year.
In the FTSE 250, Homeserve was the best performer, 5.6% higher after it reported an interim earnings rise, and 
added that it has agreed to acquire a 79% stake in US-based directory website operator eLocal. 
The home improvements firm will pay USD140 million on a "debt free, cash free" basis.
In the first half, Homeserve's revenue rose 13% to GBP457.7 million, with pretax profit up 2.1% from last year to 
GBP28.8 million from GBP24.6 million.
Intermediate Capital Group was just behind, up 4.4% in the FTSE 250, fresh from reporting an 11% rise in assets 
under management to EUR41.1 billion in the first half.  
Pretax rose by 24% year-on-year to GBP153.4 million, the asset manager raised its interim dividend by 50% to 15.0 
pence per share from 10.0p. 
Equiniti was 19% lower early Tuesday, after guiding for 2019 underlying earnings before interest, taxation, 
depreciation and amortisation at the lower end of market expectations. The financial technology outsourcer said this 
was due to weaker higher margin UK corporate activity.
Company complied consensus tipped underlying Ebitda for 2019 between GBP136 million and GBP142 million.  
Revenue is tipped to be at the upper end of GBP550 million to GBP567 million market guidance, however.  
Turning to London small caps, Dialight shed 24% in early trade, after the LED lighting specialist said its recovery 
has been hampered by a "slowdown in global markets" and uncertainty over US and China trade. 
The firm, which has exposure to US markets, expect its full-year earnings before interest and taxation to be in the 
range of GBP5 million to GBP8 million, after adjustments for non-underlying costs.

Later on Tuesday, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn do battle in the first televised debate of the UK general 
election campaign. The two leaders will face off in an hour-long encounter screened live on ITV on Tuesday 
evening.
"Latest polls show the Conservatives maintaining a 10-point or more lead over Labour, while bookmakers currently 
attach about two-thirds probability to a Conservative majority," Lloyds Bank research said.
The Nikkei 225 closed 0.5% lower on Tuesday in Tokyo, China's Shanghai Composite closed up 0.9% and the 
Hang Seng in Hong Kong 1.6% up. 
"The Chinese government took the wind out of the bull’s sails yesterday as it was reported that Beijing are 
pessimistic about the prospect of a trade deal as President Trump doesn’t want to roll back on tariffs. The trade war 
has dragged on for over one year so to a certain extent traders are used to minor setbacks." CMC Markets analyst 
David Madden said. 
He continued: "In the middle of next month, the Trump Administration will introduce fresh tariffs on roughly USD156 
billion worth of Chinese imports, unless something changes. Some traders are hoping phase one of the overall 
trade deal will be agreed upon by then so there will be no need to press ahead with new tariffs." 
US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reasserted the independence of the US central bank during White House 
talks with Trump on Monday.
Powell attended the meeting, which comes amid an unprecedented campaign of public attacks on the central bank, 
at the invitation of the president, and was joined by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Trump, who has previously lambasted Powell, tweeted that the meeting was "good & cordial", but in a second post, 
said that during the discussion, he protested "that our Fed Rate is set too high relative to the interest rates of other 
competitor countries". 
The Republican president also reportedly backed off from a proposed ban on certain flavours of e-cigarettes, over 
fears that such a move could cost him votes in next year's US presidential election.
Aides allegedly advised him to hold fire on signing a memo to ban popular e-cigarette flavours such as fruit and 
menthol, warning that it could damage his re-election chances next year in some key battleground states, The New 
York Times and Washington Post both reported.
Cigarette makers BAT and Imperial Brands were up 0.8% and 1.7% respectively.
In European equities, the CAC 40 index in Paris was 0.3% up  early Tuesday and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was 
0.4% higher. 
The economic events calendar on Tuesday has eurozone current account figures at 0900 GMT.
Sales of new cars in the EU decreased by 0.7% year-on-year in the first 10 months of 2019, industry data showed. 
From January to October, 12.9 million new vehicles were registered, the European Automobile Manufacturers 
Association said in its monthly bulletin. 
October saw over 1.17 million new vehicles registered in the bloc, the highest total for the month since 2009.

(Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group SA on Friday cut its annual earnings per share growth 
forecast for the three years from 2020 to 2022 due to planned lower passenger capacity growth.
IAG shares in London were down 3.1% at 527.80 pence each in London, the worst performer in the FTSE 100 
index.
The Anglo-Spanish airline holding company now expects average EPS growth of 10% per annum for the three 
years, compared with 12% per annum estimated previously.
The company attributed the EPS cut to lower planned available seat per kilometre growth, which is now predicted to 
be 3.4% per annum, compared with around 6% per annum estimated previously for 2019 to 2023.
ASK growth in 2020 is predicted to be 3.2%, excluding British Airways strikes in 2019 and leap year in 2020.
IAG made no change to its medium-term annual operating profit margin guidance of 12% to 15%. However, the 
company now expects gross capital expenditure to average EUR4.7 billion per annum compared with an average of 
EUR2.6 billion per annum net capital expenditure for 2019 to 2023. 
Gross capital expenditure is defined as the total investment in fleet, customer product, information technology and 
infrastructure before any proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, IAG said.
The London-headquartered airline operator, which also owns Spain's Iberia and Ireland's Aer Lingus, also said that 
it will no longer disclose monthly traffic data from January, but will instead report traffic data on a quarterly basis, in 
line with other European and North American airlines. 
All London-listed airlines, including also Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, currently report traffic monthly.

IAG said that October traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, increased by 4.8% to 24.9 million from 
23.8 million a year ago. Year-to-date traffic increased 5.6% to 241.6 million revenue passenger kilometres.
October capacity, measured in available seat kilometres, increased by 2.7% year-on-year to 29.4 million from 28.6 
million.
IAG carried 10.4 million passengers in October versus 10.0 million a year ago. Load factor increased to 85.0% from 
83.3%
British Airways saw 2.8% growth in October traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, to 13.5 million. 
Iberia recorded 8.3% traffic growth, Aer Lingus 4.8%, Level 30% and Vueling 2.9%.

(Alliance News) - Deutsche Bank has downgraded Irish budget airline Ryanair to Hold, due to the firm's better than 
expected interim results leaving "limited scope".
For the six months to September 30, Ryanair's revenue was up 11% year-on-year to EUR5.39 billion. Traffic was 
up 11% to 86 million passengers with an unchanged load factor of 96%.
Group pretax profit was flat at EUR1.26 billion.
The German bank has upgraded its annual post-tax profit forecast for Ryanair to EUR850 million versus EUR800 
million before - Ryanair has guided for profit to fall between EUR800 million to EUR900 million. Deutsche has also 
upped its revenue expectations by 1.3% to EUR8.39 billion.
As a result, Deutsche Bank has upped its earnings per share guidance by 6.2% for 2020 to 0.72 euro cents, 7% for 
2021 to EUR1.04.
In the year ended June 30, Ryanair posted a pretax profit of EUR262.3 million, down 24% year on year. Its total 
operating revenue rose 11% year-on-year to EUR2.31 billion.
Deutsche Bank analysts Jaime Rowbotham, Andy Chu and Gopal Krishan said: "With the shares up about 60% 
from their August lows of EUR8.50, up 30% (versus peer group up 18%) since June, and now trading in line with 
our target price, we downgrade our rating from Buy to Hold." 
Deutsche upped its target price for Ryanair to EUR13.50 from EUR12.50.
In London on Tuesday, Ryanair was down 0.3% at EUR13.46. In the year to date, the shares are up 28%.
The German bank feels its forecast now "more appropriately" price in the potential for earnings growth next year.
IN THE KNOW: Deutsche Bank Cuts Ryanair On Limited Upside
"While we still like Ryanair, we see limited scope for a further re-rating of the shares or incremental earnings 
upgrades near-term," the analyst added.
The bank is also keen to see how next summer plays out for the airline.
The analysts added: "Summer 2020 holds the key when it comes to the direction of travel on the numbers. Fewer 
available 737MAXs seem likely to result in lower or more costly growth, but this could be more than offset by upside 
on fares per passenger. 
"We currently assume fares per passenger to fall 1% in 2021 (yields haven't been positive for Ryanair since about 
2015), each 1% delta on fares per passenger would have a EUR50 million to EUR60 million (about 5%) impact on 
pre-tax profits in 2021, all else the same."

Wizz Air reported an October capacity increase of 20% to 3.9 million from 3.3 million. Load factor increased to 
95.3% from 94.0%.

Wizz Air said at the time: "The newly announced low fare services will connect Zaporizhzhya International Airport 
with Vienna in Austria, Budapest in Hungary, Gdansk, Wroclaw and Krakow in Poland, and Vilnius in Lithuania."

(Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a rise in revenue, but a steep rise 
in costs has hindered profit growth.
For the six months to September 30, Ryanair's revenue was up 11% year-on-year to EUR5.39 billion. Traffic was 
up 11% to 86 million passengers with an unchanged load factor of 96%.
Air fares were 5% lower, Ryanair noted, due to lower demand in the UK as well as overcapacity in Germany and 
Austria. Ancillary revenue however was up 28% to EUR1.65 billion.
Group pretax profit was flat at EUR1.26 billion. Fuel & oil costs rose 22% to EUR1.59 billion, and overall costs 
climbed by 16% to EUR1.29 billion. 
Commenting on the Boeing 737 MAX, which has been grounded due to two fatal accidents, Ryanair said it now 
expects first delivery in March or April 2020, at the earliest, and added the risk of further delay "is rising". 
"Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains cautious. We try to avoid the unreliable optimism of some 
competitors," said Ryanair. 
"Full-year traffic will grow 8% to 153 million but we expect a slightly better fare environment than last winter 
(although we have limited second-half visibility)." 
"This, however, remains sensitive to any market uncertainty such as a 'no deal' Brexit. We expect ancillary revenue 
will grow ahead of traffic growth, supporting full-year revenue per guest growth of 2% to 3%," Ryanair continued.
The airline narrowed its guidance for full-year profit after tax to a range of EUR800 million to EUR900 million from 
EUR750.0 million to EUR950.0 million previously. Profit after tax for the half year was unchanged at EUR1.15 
billion.

(Alliance News) - Liberum said Ryanair's increase in second quarter profit will be "likely to prove unusual" across 
the sector for the period.
Shares in the budget airline were up 6.5% in London on Monday at EUR13.29. The broker maintained its Buy rating 
on Ryanair with a EUR12.50 price target.
For the quarter to September 30, revenue amounted to EUR3.08 billion, up 12% year-on-year, while operating profit 
grew 8% to EUR1.01 billion.
Net profit of EUR910.2 million, up 8% on a year ago, was ahead of consensus at EUR840 million and Liberum's 
"cautious" forecast of EUR716 million.
Revenue trends were "better than expected", with average fares only down by 3%, and fares for the first half were 
5% lower against guidance of a 6% fall. This was partly mitigated by ancillary revenue growing 17% per passenger.
"The increase in profits in the quarter is likely to prove unusual amongst the European airlines, with most under 
pressure from fuel and staff costs, and lacklustre unit revenue trends," the broker commented.
The airline narrowed its guidance for full-year profit after tax to a range of EUR800 million to EUR900 million from 
EUR750.0 million to EUR950.0 million previously. Profit after tax for the half year was unchanged at EUR1.15 
billion.
"As ever", said Liberum, Ryanair remains cautious on its outlook for winter fares, though its 2% to 3% growth 
guidance is unchanged.
However, Liberum noted the outlook for Boeing 737 MAX deliveries has "deteriorated". Ryanair said it now expects 
first delivery in March or April 2020, at the earliest, and added the risk of further delay "is rising". 
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Impressed By Ryanair 's Resilient Second Quarter
Liberum said: "We see current year consensus changing little, but potential pressure on next year from the MAX 
delays."
The broker added: "Recent share price strength (+31% over the past three months) has eroded the short-term 
upside potential, but we continue to see Ryanair as a the long-term structural winner in the European short haul 
aviation market."

Hiscox said premiums growth was "good" over the first nine months of 2019, but its combined ratio was affected by 
an active period for claims amid a trio of natural disasters. For the nine months ended September, gross written 
premiums grew 5.6% to USD3.21 billion from USD3.04 billion a year prior. On a constant currency basis, gross 
written premiums grew 7.3% on the year before. "The third quarter has been an active period for claims, with the 
market experiencing significant catastrophe losses from storms in the US, the Caribbean and Japan," Chief 
Executive Officer Bronke Masojada said. "Paying claims is what we are here for, and we have reserved USD165 
million for claims from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis. We expect an additional impact from 
UK TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Costs Hurt Ryanair Profit; IAG Buys Air Europa
lower fees and profit commissions." Hiscox came to the USD165 million claims reserve after assessing the insured 
market loss for Hurricane Dorian in August, Typhoon Faxai in late August and early September, and Typhoon 
Hagibis in October. Dorian struck Bermuda, Faxai affected Japan and Hagibis touched a number of countries 
including Japan and Russia. For the full year, Hiscox expects its combined ratio of between 97% and 99%. Any 
combined ratio below 100% means an insurer made a profit from its underwriting. Over the medium term, the 
Hiscox is targeting a combined ratio of between 90% and 95%. Hiscox reported a combined operating ratio of 
94.9% in 2018.

International Consolidated Airlines has acquired Spanish airline Air Europa for EUR1 billion in cash from Globalia. 
In 2018, Air Europa generated EUR67 million in pretax profit on revenue of EUR2.1 billion. Over the same period, 
IAG - which already owns Iberia and Vueling in Spain, as well as British Airways and Aer Lingus - generated 
EUR2.89 billion pretax profit on revenue of EUR24.41 billion. "Acquiring Air Europa would add a new competitive, 
cost effective airline to IAG, consolidating Madrid as a leading European hub and resulting in IAG achieving South 
Atlantic leadership, therefore generating additional financial value for our shareholders," IAG Chief Executive Willie 
Walsh said. The buy will be funded from debt with the deal expected to complete in the second half of 2020. IAG 
has agreed to pay a EUR40 million break fee should the transaction fail to achieve regulatory approval, resulting in 
the acquisition being cancelled.

Embattled baby products retailer Mothercare intends to appoint administrators for its domestic UK retail business, 
as part of a major restructuring programme. "Through this process, it has become clear that the UK retail operations 
of the group, which today includes 79 stores, are not capable of returning to a level of structural profitability and 
returns that are sustainable for the group as it currently stands and/or attractive enough for a third party partner to 
operate on an arm's length basis. Furthermore, the company is unable to continue to satisfy the ongoing cash 
needs of Mothercare UK," the parent company explained. The retailer, however, emphasised that other business 
units remain unaffected by the move and that the company along with Mothercare UK and Mothercare Business 
Services continue to trade as normal. Following the restructuring, the company plans to focus on its global brand 
franchise business which generates over GBP500 million in revenue per year from over 1,000 international stores in 
over 40 territories. In the year ended March 31, the international business generated a profit of GBP28.3 million 
whereas the UK retail operations posted a GBP36.3 million loss.

European markets followed the sharp gains seen in Asia after last week's positive manufacturing data from China 
and the US was followed by a better than expected US jobs reports - boosting sentiment across the globe.
Adding to the positive sentiment was news of a "constructive" phone call between the US and China's trade 
representatives at the end of last week, giving hope that trade talks between the two might be heading in the right 
direction. 
The US is pointed for a positive start to the week. The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are both called 0.5% higher 
with Nasdaq at 0.7%.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
The UK construction sector's decline eased somewhat in October, though conditions remain challenging, the latest 
IHS Markit/Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply purchasing managers' index showed. At 44.2 in October, 
the PMI was below the no-change mark of 50 but improved slightly from the 43.4 points registered in September. 
Construction companies noted that demand remained subdued due to domestic political uncertainty and the 
economic backdrop. In some cases, survey respondents noted that "unusually wet weather" in October had acted 
as an additional headwind, said IHS Markit. New orders dropped for the seventh month in a row during October, but 
the rate of decline was "the least marked" since July. Softer demand conditions and a lack of new work resulted in 
another fall in staffing levels.
----------
The eurozone's manufacturing remains weak, IHS Markit revealed on Monday, with Germany once again proving 
the main drag. The eurozone October purchasing managers' index came in at a reading of 45.9, compared to 
September's 45.7. The October figure is the second-worst in seven years. Any reading below 50.0 signals a 
contraction, and above 50.0, expansion. There was a "sharp" fall in new orders, IHS Markit said, though slightly 
better than September. Manufacturing output in the eurozone showed "sustained" weakness, and job losses were 
at their worst since early 2013. Germany remained the weakest eurozone member. The October manufacturing PMI 
improved to just 42.1, after 41.7 in September, which had been the worst reading in just over a decade. Output and 
new orders both declined in Germany and October, IHS Markit said, though the rate of decline did ease. However, 
jobs were lost at the quickest rate since the start of 2010. France by contrast showed a "modest" recovery in 
October, IHS Markit also revealed Monday, with the manufacturing PMI improving to 50.7 from 50.1, meaning 
France's manufacturing sector is expanding. 
----------
Senior Chinese and US officials again sent positive signals on Friday about their efforts to formalize the partial trade 
bargain announced last month, with President Donald Trump saying he may meet with Chinese counterpart Xi 
Jinping in the state of Iowa. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday spoke by telephone with US Trade 
Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a call both sides described as 
"constructive". However, details remain scarce and the positive statements were almost identical to those made last 
week, even though Trump announced the partial deal on October 11. Trump had planned to sign a deal with 
China's leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the now-cancelled summit in Chile this month. On Friday, Trump told 
reporters he was "looking [at] a different couple locations" for a meeting with Xi, adding that it "could even be in 
Iowa."

The US is hopeful negotiations with Europe, Japan and South Korea on car manufacturing could avert a sharp 
increase in tariffs later this month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Sunday. "Our hope is that the 
negotiations we've been having with individual companies about their capital investment plans will bear enough fruit 
that it may not be necessary to put the 232 fully into effect, may not even be necessary to put it partly in effect," 
Ross told Bloomberg Television, referring to the investigation under Section 232 of a 1962 trade law. Ross, 
speaking in Bangkok, where he's attending a regional summit, told Bloomberg discussions thus far have been "very 
good" with the major car-producing countries in Europe, Japan and South Korea. There is currently a 2.5% tariff on 
cars imported into the US from the EU. Trump has said he could raise this to 25%.

(Alliance News) - The boss of budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Monday the Irish firm would call on 
regulators to force divestments from rival International Consolidated Airlines Group SA as part of its deal to buy 
Spanish firm Air Europa, Reuters reported.
Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary told analysts during a call after the acquisition was announced that 
he thought it was a "good deal" for British Airways-owner IAG but that it was a "bad deal from a competition point of 
view."
"It is a merger to monopoly in Madrid and I think we would certainly be looking for the competition authorities to 
require some competition divestments, particularly in the Air Europa short-haul," O'Leary added.

Shares in Ryanair were 8.1% higher at EUR13.50 in London on Monday, IAG up 1.4% at 550.18 pence.
Earlier on Monday, IAG said it acquired Spanish airline Air Europa for EUR1 billion in cash from Globalia. Air 
Europa operates domestic and international flights to 69 destinations, including long-haul routes to Latin America, 
the US and North Africa.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are set to open higher on Monday following positive job news coming from 
the US on Friday and renewed optimism the US will not implement new trade tariffs on Europe, Japan and South 
Korea.
In early UK corporate news, British Airways-parent International Consolidated Airlines has acquired Air Europa for 
EUR1 billion, while Irish budget peer Ryanair saw a half-year rise in revenue and traffic. Insurer Hiscox reported a 
rise in written premiums in the third quarter. 
IG says futures indicate the FTSE 100 index of large-caps to open 17.68 points, 0.2%, higher at 7,320.10 on 
Monday. The FTSE 100 index closed 0.8% higher at 7,302.42 Friday.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2933 early Friday, soft against USD1.2941 at the London close on Friday.
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite both 
ending up 1.1%, and the S&P 500 added 1.0%.
"US equities reached fresh all-time highs following an inspiring jobs report on Friday. The US economy added 
128,000 new nonfarm jobs in October, comfortably beating the 85,000 expected by analysts despite the [General 
Motors] strike. The average hourly earnings grew 0.2%, slightly lower than 0.3% pencilled in by analysts, but better 
than 0.0% printed a month earlier," commented London Capital Group analyst Ipek Ozkardeskaya.
Ozkardeskaya continued: "The deluge of better-than-expected company earnings and encouraging economic data, 
combined with the Federal Reserve's 25-basis-point cut last week gave a serious boost to the stock markets."
The US is hopeful negotiations with Europe, Japan and South Korea on car manufacturing could avert a sharp 
increase in tariffs later this month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Sunday.

"Our hope is that the negotiations we've been having with individual companies about their capital investment plans 
will bear enough fruit that it may not be necessary to put the 232 fully into effect, may not even be necessary to put 
it partly in effect," Ross told Bloomberg Television, referring to the investigation under Section 232 of a 1962 trade 
law.
Ross, speaking in Bangkok, where he's attending a regional summit, told Bloomberg that discussions thus far have 
been "very good" with the major car-producing countries in Europe, Japan and South Korea.
There is currently a 2.5% tariff on cars imported into the US from the EU. US President Donald Trump has said he 
could raise this to 25%.
The White House agreed in May to delay new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts for six months.
In a further boost to sentiment, senior Chinese and US officials on Friday again sent positive signals about their 
efforts to formalise the partial trade bargain announced last month, with Trump saying he may meet with Chinese 
counterpart Xi Jinping in the state of Iowa.
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He on Friday spoke by telephone with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a call both sides described as "constructive".
In Asia on Friday, the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.6%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 1.5%.
Japanese markets were closed as the country celebrates Culture Day.
In the economic calendar on Monday, manufacturing PMI data are due from Germany at 0855 GMT and the 
eurozone at 0900 GMT with construction PMI figures from the UK at 0930 GMT. In the US, factory orders are at 
1500 GMT.
IAG said it has acquired the entire issued share capital of Spanish airline Air Europa for EUR1 billion in cash. IAG 
already owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling, as well as Ireland's Aer Lingus.
IAG said the Air Europa deal will transform the company's Madrid hub into a "true rival" for Europe's four largest 
hubs: Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London Heathrow and Paris Charles De Gaulle.
The company believes the acquisition will be earnings per share accretive in the first full year. The deal is also 
expected to generate "significant" revenue synergies by 2025. 
IAG Chief Executive Officer Willie Walsh added: "Acquiring Air Europa would add a new competitive, cost effective 
airline to IAG, consolidating Madrid as a leading European hub and resulting in IAG achieving South Atlantic 
leadership, therefore generating additional financial value for our shareholders. 
The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020.
Rival Ryanair Holdings reported a rise in revenue, but a steep rise in costs has hindered profit growth.
For the six months to September 30, Ryanair's revenue was up 11% year-on-year to EUR5.39 billion. Traffic was 
up 11% to 86 million passengers with an unchanged load factor of 96%.
Air fares were 5% lower, Ryanair noted, due to lower demand in the UK as well as overcapacity in Germany and 
Austria. Ancillary revenue however was up 28% to EUR1.65 billion.
Group pretax profit was flat at EUR1.26 billion. Fuel & oil costs rose 22% to EUR1.59 billion, and overall costs 
climbed by 16% to EUR1.29 billion.
"Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains cautious. We try to avoid the unreliable optimism of some 
competitors," added Ryanair.

Insurer Hiscox said it was "pleased" with its growth in the third quarter, reporting a rise in written premiums from 
every division.
Total gross written premiums rose 7.3% to USD3.21 billion in the period to September 30. Hiscox Retail reported a 
7.0% rise in written premiums, Hiscox London Market 9.7% and Hiscox Re 6.1%.
"The third quarter has been an active period for claims, with the market experiencing significant catastrophe losses 
from storms in the US, the Caribbean and Japan. Paying claims is what we are here for, and we have reserved 
USD165 million for claims from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis. We expect an additional impact 
from lower fees and profit commissions," said Chief Executive Bronek Masojada.
Kosmos Energy said it was able to continue to "build momentum" in the third quarter.
In the three months to September 30, revenue rose to USD357.0 million from USD250.2 million the year before. As 
a result, the Dallas-headquartered firm swung to a net income of USD16.1 million compared to a loss of USD126.1 
million the year before.
Kosos Chair & CEO Andrew Inglis said: "At current oil prices we expect to deliver the 2019 free cash flow we set 
out at our capital markets day in February. Our 2019 drilling program in Mauritania and Senegal has increased the 
gas initially in place to the top end of our 50-100 Tcf range. Furthermore, our first infrastructure-led exploration well 
in Equatorial Guinea was successful and we expect this to further enhance the value of our Equatorial Guinea 
acquisition."
Direct marketer 4imprint said demand has "remained robust" in the second half.
The company said it has experienced growth in both new and existing customer orders consistent with that seen in 
the first half.
4imprint added: "The relatively new brand recognition element of the group's marketing activities continues to 
perform well. As a result, the board expects a strong full-year trading performance, with revenue growth of around 
16% over 2018."
4imprint recorded pretax profit of USD44.2 million for the 52 weeks to December 29, 2018, on revenue of 
USD738.4 million.
Marston's has sold 137 pubs for GBP44.9 million to Admiral Taverns.
The company said the disposal is in line with its plans to reduce its debt in part through the disposal of certain non-
core assets. The assets being disposed of are smaller wet-led leased, tenanted and franchised pubs. The deal is 
expected to complete before the end of November. 
Saudi Aramco announced Sunday its long-awaited stock market debut in what could be the world's biggest IPO, 
underpinning Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitions to overhaul the kingdom's oil-reliant economy.
After years of delay, Aramco said it plans to sell an unspecified number of shares on the Riyadh stock exchange, 
calling it a "historic" milestone for the energy giant which pumps 10% of the world's oil. However, the state firm said 
there were no current plans for an international listing, indicating that the long-discussed goal for a two-stage IPO 
including an offering on a foreign bourse had been put aside.
With analysts saying that Aramco could be valued at up to USD1.7 trillion, the initial public offering is potentially the 
world's biggest, depending on how much of the company it decides to sell.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening higher on Tuesday, tracking gains in Asian equity 
markets, as high-level trade talks between the US and China draw near.
In company news, budget airline easyJet benefited from strikes at rivals British Airways and Ryanair in the fourth 
quarter, recruiter PageGroup's third quarter was hurt by Brexit and US-China trade war uncertainty and sportscar 
maker Aston Martin made board changes. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 16.02 points higher at 7,213.90. The blue-chip index closed up 
42.50 points, or 0.6%, at 7,197.88 on Monday.
easyJet said it delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, with strong customer demand driving 
outperformance. 
The airline said it expects to deliver annual pretax profit for financial 2019 in a range between GBP420 million and 
GBP430 million. This is in the upper half of the company's previously guidance range but down from GBP445 
million the year before.
In addition, easyJet reported passenger numbers were up 8.6% to 96 million in the year that ended September 30, 
while the load factor for the year is to decrease by 1.4 percentage points to 91.5%, the company added.
Total revenue per seat at constant currency for the second half will increase by 0.8%, which was an 
outperformance compared to easyJet's previous guidance. The company attributed the performance to "yield 
optimisation self-help initiatives" in the fourth quarter and increased demand due to strikes at rivals British Airways 
and Ryanair Holdings. 
easyJet added that first quarter financial 2020 forward bookings are in line with the first quarter of financial 2019. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: easyJet Gets Boost From Strikes At Rivals
"As a result of our self-help initiatives and the increased demand due to disruption at British Airways and Ryanair, 
we anticipate achieving headline profit before tax for the full year 2019 of between GBP420 million and GBP430 
million, in the upper half of our previous guidance range," CEO Johan Lundgren said. 
Recruiter PageGroup said its third quarter was hurt by political and economic uncertainty in its larger markets, 
including Greater China, the UK and France.
For the quarter ended September 30, gross profit was up 4.2% to GBP216.7 million at constant currency profit was 
up 2.1%.
Third quarter gross profit Europe, the Middle East & Africa was up 7%, the Americas region was up 17%. However 
in the UK gross profit was down 4.1% and in the Asia Pacific region it was down 4.0%.
Chief Executive Steve Ingram said: "Looking ahead, the deterioration in trading conditions seen during Q3 across 
the majority of our regions is anticipated to continue. In the UK, heightened Brexit related uncertainty is expected to 
remain as we approach and go beyond 31 October. 
"With worsening macro-economic indicators in Continental Europe, particularly in Germany, and in the US, there 
are signs that growth in these markets may slow. In Greater China, confidence in Mainland China continues to be 
affected by trade tariff uncertainty and the social unrest in Hong Kong is increasing."
In light of these challenges, PageGroup expects financial 2019 operating profit to be in the range of GBP140 million 
to GBP150 million. Last year, operating profit was GBP142.5 million.
Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings said shareholder group Adeem and Primewagon named two non-executive 
directors to the board. Mahmoud Samy Mohamed Aly El Sayed and Amr AbouelSeoud are to join immediately. The 
sports car maker said non-executives Najeeb Al Humaidhi And Saoud Al Humaidhi are to step down. 
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing has pulled out of its bid to buy the operator of the London Stock Exchange, it 
said overnight Tuesday.
HKEX made a GBP29.6 billion offer, or GBP31.6 billion including debt, for London Stock Exchange Group in mid-
September. The bid was rejected later that month.
LSEG had said it saw "fundamental flaws" in the approach, and also noted any combination would come under 
intense scrutiny from a variety of regulators.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.7%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.4%. The Shanghai market reopened Tuesday after being shut for a week for the 
Golden Week holidays. Hong Kong also reopened on Tuesday after being closed for holiday on Monday.
Chinese business activity expanding at its quickest pace in five months in September, the Caixin general services 
purchasing managers' index showed.
The composite PMI, which covers both manufacturing and services, rose to 51.9 in September from 51.6 in August, 
its best performance since April.
Caixin said the improvement was helped by improved manufacturing output, despite a softer rise in activity in the 
services sector.
Meanwhile, the latest round of high-level trade talks are due to begin on Thursday. Beijing's top trade envoy Liu He 
will meet with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the White 
House said in a statement on Monday.
US President Donald Trump said Monday he would prefer to strike a comprehensive trade bargain with China, in 
comments days before top US and Chinese officials are due to resume trade talks in Washington.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: easyJet Gets Boost From Strikes At Rivals
But with little sign the two sides have made progress in bridging the distance between them, speculation has 
mounted in recent months they may reach a deal which addresses only some of Washington's extensive 
grievances.
"I think it's not what we prefer at all. My inclination is to get a big deal," Trump told reporters when asked if he could 
accept a partial agreement.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2297 early Tuesday, lower than USD1.2321 at the London equities close Monday.

(Alliance News) - easyJet PLC said Tuesday it delivered a "solid" performance in the fourth quarter, continuing to 
perform in line with expectations.
easyJet shares were 5.1% lower at 1,113.80 pence each in London.
The budget airline said it saw "robust" customer demand, with self-help initiatives "driving outperformance" in 
passenger and ancillary revenue per seat.
As a result, easyJet expects headline pretax profit of between GBP420 million and GBP430 million - in the upper 
half of the airline's guidance range. In the year ending September 30, 2018, the airline recorded GBP578 million in 
headline pretax profit.
"Our cost performance remained strong and in line with expectations despite the difficult fourth quarter disruption 
environment. Our operational resilience initiative was a driving force behind the strong performance," the airline 
continued.
Chief Executive Johan Lundgren added: "easyJet has continued to perform in line with expectations, despite 
challenging market conditions."
Lundgren attributed the increased demand on the "disruption" seen at rivals British Airways and Ryanair Holdings 
PLC. British Airways is owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.
IAG and Ryanair have spent the summer fighting with pilot and cabin crew unions, with Ryanair hurt by several 
strikes.
easyJet full year passenger numbers increased by 8.6% year-on-year to 96 million, with capacity growing 10% to 
105 million seats. Load factor declined 1.4 percentage points to 91.5%.
TOP NEWS: easyJet Expects Annual Profit At Upper End Of Guidance
At constant currency, annual total revenue per seat is expected to decrease by about 2.7%. Last year, the airline 
reported revenue per seat of GBP61.94. In the second half, however, revenue per seat is expected to see slight 
growth, an outperformance on previous guidance.
"Our implementation of initiatives in the fourth quarter to optimise yield has led to solid revenue performance with 
total revenue per seat at constant currency set to increase for the full year. We have continued to invest in 
operational resilience, with the programme successfully reducing the impact of disruption on our operations. As a 
result, we expect to report a fall in headline cost per seat for the year, excluding fuel at constant currency," added 
Lundgren.
Total headline cost is expected to rise by about 12% due to increased capacity, increased fuel costs and foreign 
exchange movements. At constant currency, headline cost per seat is expected to decline slightly, in line with 
previous guidance.
In financial 2018, headline cost per seat was GBP55.87.
easyJet said: "Despite a difficult disruption environment experienced in the fourth quarter, which included the 
impact of storms across Europe and the technical issues experienced at Gatwick airport, the operational resilience 
initiative was a key driving force behind the strong performance."
Total fuel cost for financial 2019 is expected to be GBP1.42 billion, up 20% from the GBP1.18 billion reported last 
year.
Looking ahead, easyJet said its 2020 first quarter forward bookings are currently in line with the year before. The 
airline also noted its capacity growth in financial 2020 will be at the lower end of the company's historic range. 
Year-on-year capacity growth is guided for about 2% in the first quarter.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
London Stock Exchange Group said it is making "good" progress on its Refinitiv acquisition, shortly after Hong 
Kong Exchanges & Clearing pulled out of its bid to buy the operator of the London Stock Exchange. LSEG noted 
the announcement by HKEX to not make a formal offer for the group, after initially proposing a potential GBP30 
billion takeover offer in mid-September. LSEG initially rejected the offer later that month. At the time of the rejection, 
LSEG said it saw "fundamental flaws" in the approach, and also noted any combination would come under intense 
scrutiny from a variety of regulators. On Tuesday, however, HKEX formally announced it had withdrawn its offer to 
buy the FTSE 100-listed financial exchange operator.

----------
PageGroup said profit for the third quarter of 2019 rose despite most regions being hit by increased macro-
economic and political uncertainty during the period. For the quarter ended September 30, gross profit increased to 
GBP216.7 million from GBP207.9 million the same period the year before, a rise of 4.2% at reported currency rates 
and 2.1% at constant rates. The Europe, Middle East & Africa region was the largest contributor, with gross profit 
rising by 7.0% to GBP101.5 million from GBP94.9 million, with strong growth in Germany and Italy. Meanwhile the 
Americas had the strongest rate of growth, rising by 17% to GBP37.3 million from GBP31.8 million the prior year on 
a robust performance from the US and Latin America. However, Asia Pacific's profit fell by 4.0% to GBP44.1 million 
from GBP46.0 million, as PageGroup's operations in China declined on trade war uncertainty and social unrest 
hurting its business in Hong Kong. US-China trade war concerns also affected the group's business in Singapore. 
Finally, gross profit from the UK dropped by 4.1% to GBP33.8 million from GBP35.2 million, as increased Brexit 
uncertainty took its toll on candidate and client confidence at all levels within the period.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were broadly lower on Tuesday with LSEG the worst blue chip performer, down 4.9%. In the FTSE 
250, PageGroup was the worst performer, down 11%. Wall Street was pointed to a lower open. Ahead, Federal 
Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will speak at the National Association for Business Economics' annual meeting in 
Denver, Colorado at 1730 BST.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Chinese business activity expanding at its quickest pace in five months in September, the Caixin general services 
purchasing managers' index showed. The composite PMI, which covers both manufacturing and services, rose to 
51.9 in September from 51.6 in August, its best performance since April. Caixin said the improvement was helped 
by improved manufacturing output, despite a slighter rise in activity in the services sector. "China's economy 
showed signs of marginal recovery in September, as the labour market improved and domestic demand increased 
at a faster pace," said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
----------
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: LSEG Committed To Refinitiv As HKEX Abandons Bid
The US and Japan formally signed a bilateral trade agreement after US President Donald Trump again complained 
about Japan's chronic trade surplus with his country. The pact was signed by Japan's ambassador to the US, 
Shinsuke Sugiyama, and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer at the White House on Monday. Washington 
reached the deal with Tokyo amid its year-long trade war with Beijing. The deal, which was initially announced by 
Japan and the US last month, includes increased access to Japanese markets for American agricultural producers.
----------
Facing a staunch backlash in the US Congress over his decision to stand back in the face of a Turkish invasion of 
northern Syria, Trump threatened to destroy the Turkish economy if Ankara takes steps that are "off limits". The 
previous night, Trump had spoken with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by phone and then issued a 
statement saying Ankara would go ahead with a "long-planned" operation in northern Syria. The Kurdish-led Syrian 
Democratic Forces, which have been the main partner allied with the US in defeating Islamic State, dominate areas 
in north-east Syria. Turkey considers the Kurdish People's Protection Units, which lead the SDF, an offshoot of the 
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is waging an insurgency within Turkey.
----------
UK government debt is set to rocket to levels not seen since the 1960s in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a leading 
economic think tank has warned. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said following last month's spending review, 
Government borrowing was on course to top GBP50 billion next year, more than double what the Office for Budget 
Responsibility was forecasting as recently as March. However, in the event of even a "relatively benign" no-deal 
Brexit, the IFS said that could rise to almost GBP100 billion – while debt would climb to almost 90% of national 
income for the first time since the mid 1960s.

Trump said he would prefer to strike a comprehensive trade bargain with China, in comments days before top US 
and Chinese officials are due to resume trade talks in Washington. But with little sign the two sides have made 
progress in bridging the distance between them, speculation has mounted in recent months they may reach a deal 
which addresses only some of Washington's extensive grievances. "I think it's not what we prefer at all. My 
inclination is to get a big deal," Trump told reporters when asked if he could accept a partial agreement. With eight 
days to go before the next round of punitive tariffs is due to hit, Beijing's top trade envoy Liu He will meet with US 
Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin beginning Thursday, Chinese 
state media reported. The high-level Chinese delegation also includes commerce minister Zhong Shan, central 
bank governor Yi Gang and vice minister of industry and information technology Wang Zhijun. The vice minister for 
agriculture Wang Shouwen has also been added to the negotiating team after China last month announced that it 
had started buying US soybean and pork.

Campaigners are expected to lodge an appeal after a judge dismissed a legal action aimed at forcing the UK prime 
minister to request a Brexit extension if no withdrawal deal is secured with the EU by October 19. The Outer House 
of the Court of Session in Edinburgh refused the order sought by SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and others in a 
judgment on Monday. Lord Pentland ruled it was not necessary to compel Johnson to comply with the terms of the 
so-called Benn Act given the "unequivocal assurances" of Boris Johnson and the government made before the 
court. The court's Inner House is expected to hear an appeal on Tuesday.

(Alliance News) - Budget airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Wednesday both reported a 
rise in passenger traffic in September, compared to a year before.
Ryanair said group traffic rose by 7.6% to 14.1 million from 13.1 million reported in September last year. The result 
includes 600,000 passengers carried by Laudamotion.
In July last year, Ryanair acquired the remaining 75% interest in Austrian airline Laudamotion GmbH.
Excluding Laudamotion, Ryanair's traffic grew 7.1% to 13.5 million customers in September.
On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair traffic rose 10% to 150.3 million from 136.8 million.
Ryanair's load factor was 96% in September, the same as its rolling annual figure.
Meanwhile, rival Wizz Air said it continued to grow its network and improve its customer offering.
The Hungarian carrier increased capacity, measured in available seat kilometres, by 20% to 4.0 million from 3.4 
million a year prior. Load factor advanced by 0.5 percentage point to 94.5%.
Wizz Air carried a total number of 3.8 million passengers in September, which was up 20% year-on-year from 3.2 
million. The group's traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, rose by 23% to 6.3 million from 5.1 million 
reported in September last year.
For the 12 months to September-end, passenger numbers improved by 16% to 37.9 million, with capacity 
increasing by 14% to 40.6 million. Load factor was 1.4 percentage point higher at 93.4%.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair And Wizz Air Report Growth In Traffic In September
Looking ahead, Wizz Air said it is planning a route network expansion with 24 new routes to Poland, Hungary and 
Romania as well as Brussels Zaventem as a new destination. The FTSE 250-listed airline also said it intends to 
allocate five new aircraft to Budapest, Warsaw, Gdansk and Krakow. 
Ryanair shares were down 1.7% at EUR10.59 each on Wednesday morning in London, while Wizz Air shares were 
trading 0.5% lower at 3,625.00 pence each.

German Pilots Union Vote In Favour Of Ryanair Labour Agreement

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Wednesday its German pilots agreed to a four-year collective labour 
agreement.
The agreement will cover all directly employed pilots in Germany until March 2023. Ryanair noted the deal saw a 
majority of 99% vote in favour.
"The agreement, negotiated between Ryanair and the pilot union VC, will deliver a new pay structure along with a 
fixed 5/4 roster," the Irish budget airline said. 
Ryanair added that it has agreed a "social plan" with VC to "govern German base closures or reductions".
The deal with VC was originally agreed in early September but required approval from union members.
Ryanair has seen numerous disagreements with pilots unions across Europe this year, with British pilots striking in 
September. Other countries that have gone on strike include Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. 
Ryanair is hoping to put the rocky few months behind it with this deal in Germany following an agreement with 
Belgian pilots in May. 
In mid-September, the British Airline Pilots' Association, a trade union representing Ryanair's UK-based pilots, 
called-off a further five strikes scheduled for the rest of the September. Ryanair, in response, welcomed Balpa's 
decision to call off the strikes and said it had invited Balpa to resume talks with the company.
Following this, Ryanair agreed to a four-year collective labour agreement with its UK-based cabin crew.
The UK crew, by a majority of 80%, voted in favour of the labour agreement, which will implement a new pay 
structure with increased guaranteed income and returning to a 5/3 roster.
Shares in Ryanair were 2.3% lower in London at midday on Wednesday at EUR10.53 each.

(Alliance News) - Hundreds of hotels in Spain are facing imminent closure over the collapse of UK travel firm 
Thomas Cook, the head of the Spanish hotel federation warned on Monday.
"There are 500 hotels which are going to close immediately due to the collapse of Thomas Cook and the situation 
could get worse if the government doesn't take immediate action," Juan Molas, head of Spain's Confederation of 
Hotels and Tourist Accommodation, told business daily Cinco Dias.
And the sum in unpaid bills left by the demise of the tour operator would be much higher than the initial estimate of 
EUR200 million, said Molas, whose organisation represents 15,000 businesses.
"It will be much more. The amount for only eight chains is close to EUR100 million."
Of those hotels facing immediate closure, 100 were exclusively dependent on Thomas Cook, he said, while the rest 
counted on the firm for between 30 and 70% of their clients.
One hotel in Fuerteventura, the second largest of the Canary Islands, had recently undergone a 20-million-euro 
upgrade and was now faced with 700 rooms "which are going to be empty from October 7" and 200 employees it 
would be forced to dismiss.
Worst hit are those in the Canaries and the Balearic Islands, where 40% of hotels are affected.
The industry has put together an emergency plan to be presented to Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto at the next 
Spanish tourism board meeting on October 7 which will also address the urgent question of air links with the Canary 
Islands.
Industry experts fear the impact there could be even more devastating than elsewhere as the resort is very popular 
as a winter destination among tourists from northern Europe.
Industry Head Say 500 Spain Hotels Face Closure After Thomas Cook Fall
"The busy season is starting and Thomas Cook had 30% of air capacity," Molas said, indicating the disappearance 
of the package holidaymaker could affect some 1.3 million airline seats, with Tenerife and Lanzarote particularly 
badly hit.
He urged the government to contact Ryanair Holdings PLC, one of the few carriers that flies there, to urge the 
budget airline "to reconsider" plans to close four bases in Spain, three of them in the Canaries, saying it was 
"critical" that the airline maintain its flights.

(Alliance News) - JPMorgan Global Growth & Income PLC on Friday reported a rise in net assets over its most 
recent ended financial year but underperformed its benchmark.
At June 30, the trust's NAV per share stood at 332.40 pence each, 4.4% higher than the 318.40p seen at the same 
point a year prior.
JPMorgan Global Growth's net assets increased 7.1% over the twelve months, ending the year at GBP441.5 million 
compared to GBP410.8 million the year before. The trust reissued 3.8 million shares from treasury during the 
period, explaining the discrepancy.
The trust paid a 12.52p in dividends during the period, 3.0% higher than the 12.16p distributed the year before. 
Going forward, JPMorgan Global Growth intends to pay a 13.04p, in four equal distributions, for financial 2020. 
JPMorgan Global Growth NAV total return in the period was 8.7%, underperforming its benchmark - the MSCI AC 
World Index - which gained 9.7% in the same period.
"Financial markets in the year to June 30 continued to be volatile, as a result of  concerns about the escalating 
trade war between the US and China and fears about the effects of this on global growth. After recording falls in the 
first half of the financial year, the second half saw global markets recover strongly leading to positive performance 
for the full year," said Chair Nigel Wightman. 
The trust's investment managers, Helge Skibeli, Rajesh Tanna and Tim Woodhouse, added: "Stock picking in the 
first half of the financial year was the primary reason for the underperformance over the past 12 months. Asos, 
Pioneer Natural Resources, and Ryanair were the most significant detractors from performance."
The managers noted Iberdrola, O'Reilly Automotive, and Microsoft as some of the "strongest performers" over the 
year. 
JPMorgan Global Growth & Income Assets Rise, Underperforms Benchmark
"Having increased gearing at the start of the year given our belief that earnings growth would be resilient, we have 
recently reduced it to reflect increased risks and markets at all-time highs. The volatility in December last year 
afforded us some opportunities, and we believe that it is prudent to now bring exposure back down again having 
taken advantage of those opportunities. It is important to note however that gearing remains a positive feature of 
the company, and we are actively watching for the opportunity to take it higher once more," the managers added.
The trust ended the period with a gearing level of 3.8%, lowered from 4.9% at the start of the period. Since June 30, 
the managers have lowered the gearing to 0.1%.
Shares in JPMorgan Global Growth & Income were 0.3% lower in London on Friday at 339.00 pence each.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is not interested in buying Thomas Cook subsidiary 
Condor but would consider acquiring parts of the German holiday carrier if it is split up to guarantee competition, 
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Thursday.
The head of Europe's largest budget carrier charged the German government's recent EUR380 million bridge loan 
for Condor was in preparation for Lufthansa buying another German airline and gaining market dominance.
"This is yet another fattening up of a German turkey," O'Leary told a press conference in Vienna, the base of 
Ryanair's Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion.
British tour operator Thomas Cook collapsed and filed for liquidation on Monday, leaving tens of thousands of 
holidaymakers stranded. Unlike its parent company, Condor is solvent and continues to operate, but has obtained a 
bridging loan to guard against potential liquidity shortages.
O'Leary said European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager should not only look at US giants like 
Amazon and Google, but at Germany's Lufthansa. He pointed to the German carrier's past acquisition of troubled 
Air Berlin.
If Lufthansa ended up swallowing Condor, "we would expect there to be competition divestments" that might be of 
interest to Ryanair, the head of Ireland-based airline said.
Lufthansa made a non-binding offer for Condor in May but has not confirmed this week whether it is still interested. 
However, Lufthansa has never officially withdrawn its bid.

(Alliance News) - Stobart Group Ltd on Wednesday said it was trading in line with market expectations in the six 
months to the end of August and continues to make "strong" commercial progress in its two core divisions.
In the Aviation unit, passenger numbers at London Southend Airport have increased by 42% in the first half 
compared to the same period last year, Stobart said, driven by the start of Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC 
flights in April, Scottish regional airline Loganair flights in May and the continued growth of British low-cost airline 
easyJet PLC.
The aviation, energy and civil engineering firm also highlighted that, from Tuesday next week, Hungarian low-cost 
airline Wizz Air Holdings PLC will start flying from London Southend Airport to three new destinations. These new 
routes will help support the continued growth in passenger numbers, Stobart highlighted, in line with its target of 
reaching five million passengers per annum by February 2023. 
"Given the ongoing uncertainty in the sector, in part caused by Brexit, the group is taking a cautious approach to 
passenger forecasts in the short term, with the board working on the basis of 2.3 million passengers for the year 
ending February 2020. This would represent an increase of 53% versus the previous year," the company said in its 
statement Wednesday. 
Turning to the Energy unit, the volume of waste managed, which is predominantly processed into waste wood fuel, 
increased by 148,000 tonnes to 806,000 tonnes, Stobart said. This is equivalent to a run rate of 1.7 million tonnes 
per annum, representing a 22% increase on the same period last year. The continued improvement in performance 
was boosted by the energy recovery plants that Stobart Energy supplies under long term contracts, the company 
said.
Stobart will announce its interim results on November 14. 
The stock was trading 0.9% higher in London on Wednesday at 128.93 pence a share.

(Alliance News) - Thomas Cook's collapse should ensure easyJet achieves margin outperformance in the 2020 
financial year, said Berenberg.
Shares in the low-cost airline were up 2.8% at 1,137.50 pence in London on Tuesday.
Thomas Cook, which collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning, was set to represent 2.5% of European 
short-haul capacity in 2020, according to Berenberg analysis. The tour operator's failure may remove as much as 
5% of competing seats from easyJet's network in peak quarter.
Recent airline distress, including troubles at France's Aigle Azur and XL Airways and Slovenia's Adria Airways, 
should support pricing which "disproportionately" benefits easyJet.
"Both easyJet and Ryanair will likely experience stronger demand after Thomas Cook's failure. Thomas Cook 
represented 1.5% of the seats on both the easyJet and Ryanair networks, from our analysis of summer capacity. 
However, roughly half of Ryanair's Thomas Cook exposure is to the group's Condor brand, which continues to 
operate," said Berenberg.
Even if demand slows, Berenberg thinks pricing will continue to benefit from capacity deceleration from both 
easyJet and the industry overall. The bank estimates short-haul European capacity growth of 3% in 2020, 50 basis 
points lower than previously lower, assuming more than 60% of Thomas Cook's aircraft remain in Europe following 
its failure. 
Accordingly, Berenberg now expects easyJet's first half revenue per seat in the 2020 financial year to be up 3.2% 
year-on-year, 50 basis points higher than previously forecast.
"There could be further upside if more airlines in easyJet's markets fail," noted Berenberg.
For the airline's pre-close statement on October 8, Berenberg expects "some caution", but said a restrained tone on 
demand may present "another opportunity to position for the earnings improvement we expect into financial 2020".
IN THE KNOW: Thomas Cook Failure Should Provide Tailwind For easyJet
easyJet trades on a price to earnings ratio of 10.8 times, which Berenberg deemed a "compelling entry point" as it 
reiterated its Buy rating on the stock. The bank raised its price target to 1,260p from 1,150p.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening higher on Tuesday, tracking modest gains by Asian 
equity markets, while the UK Supreme Court is set to give its ruling on the UK prime minister's suspension of 
Parliament.
In company news, tour operator TUI said it is gauging the impact of rival Thomas Cook's collapse on its own 
business, budget airline Ryanair said its cabin crew has approved a four-year labour deal, and financial firm Close 
Brothers announced the departure of its chief executive. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open up 27.82 points at 7,353.90. The blue-chip index closed down 
18.84 points, or 0.3%, at 7,326.08 on Monday.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.1%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.5%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.3%. Financial markets in Japan reopened on Tuesday after being closed on 
Monday for a holiday.
Japan's economy showed signs of "robust" growth in September, but suffered slowdowns in both its manufacturing 
and services sectors, according to survey result issued Tuesday. The Jibun Bank flash composite purchasing 
managers' index reading decreased in September to 51.5 from 51.9 in August.
"The resilience of Japan's service sector to the struggles of the country's manufacturers continued to shine through 
during September," said IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes. "As a result, it's looking like Japan will boast what will be 
a robust rate of growth in the current climate for the third quarter."
Anglo-German travel company TUI said it is assessing the short-term impact of smaller peer Thomas Cook's 
insolvency on its financial 2019 results.
TUI reiterated its financial 2019 underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortisation guidance, given in March, 
of negative 26% compared to underlying EBITA of EUR1.18 billion in financial 2018.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: TUI To Be More Cost Competitive In Airlines
TUI said its Holiday Experiences unit was delivering strong results, but its Markets & Airlines arm was facing "a 
number of ongoing external challenges". These included the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, airline over-
capacity, and continued Brexit uncertainty. However, the Summer 2019 season is "closing out in line with 
expectations", TUI noted.
Looking ahead to the coming financial year, TUI said it intends to be more cost competitive in Markets & Airlines in 
financial 2020. 
"Where TUI customers are booked on Thomas Cook Airlines flights and these are no longer operated, replacement 
flights will be offered. We are currently assessing the short-term impact of Thomas Cook's insolvency under the 
current circumstances, on the final week of our 2019 financial result," said Chief Executive Officer Friedrich 
Joussen. 
Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings said its cabin crew based in the UK voted by a majority of 80% in favour of a four-year 
Collective Labour Agreement, to cover all Ryanair's directly employed cabin crew in the UK until March 2023.
Ryanair said the CLA is to deliver a new pay structure, with increased guaranteed income. The agreement was 
negotiated between Ryanair and the union UNITE.
Soft drinks maker AG Barr said it is on course to deliver a full year performance in line with its revised expectations, 
following a profit warning in July. 
For the six months to July 27, revenue fell to GBP122.5 million from GBP136.9 million last year, and pretax profit 
declined to GBP13.5 million from GBP18.2 million. The company said it incurred exceptional costs associated with 
a restructuring programme which started during the period.
AG Barr raised its interim dividend to 4 pence from 3.90 pence last year. 
"The first half of 2019 has been disappointing," the company said. "However, it was always expected to be a year of 
pricing transition for the business which would lead to elevated levels of risk.  We now have plans in place to 
address our specific brand related challenges and to ensure that the business is appropriately scaled to perform in 
the current market. 
"We are entering a period of less demanding trading comparisons and, as our new pricing establishes and our 
strong second half brand plans take effect, our focus is now on returning to long-term growth. Despite continuing 
economic uncertainty we expect to meet the revised profit expectations communicated in July."
Merchant bank Close Brothers said it delivered a solid annual performance, as it also announced the departure of 
its chief executive. 
For the financial year ended July 31, net interest income rose to GBP505.7 million from GBP486.1 million last year 
and its loan book on July 31, was up 5.7% to GBP7.6 billion from GBP7.2 billion a year ago. 
The company's common equity tier one capital ratio increased to 13.0% and return on opening equity "remained 
strong" at 15.7%.
Close Brothers is proposing a full-year dividend per share of 66.0p, up 5%.
Separately, Close Brothers said Chief Executive Preben Prebensen will step down but remain with the firm for 12 
months to ensure a smooth handover. The company has begun the search for a new CEO and is looking both 
internally and externally. 
The pound was quoted at USD1.2430 early Tuesday, marginally lower than USD1.2440 at the London equities 
close Monday.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: TUI To Be More Cost Competitive In Airlines
The UK's highest court will give its historic ruling on Tuesday morning over the legality of the five-week suspension 
of Parliament.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has been accused of an unlawful "abuse of power", will be in the US when 
the Supreme Court announces its findings, following an unprecedented hearing last week.
Eleven justices have been asked to determine whether his advice to the Queen to prorogue Parliament, for what 
opponents describe as an "exceptionally long" period, was unlawful.
The Supreme Court decision is due at 1030 BST.
Meanwhile, Johnson failed to achieve a "New York breakthrough" on Brexit in a meeting with European Council 
President Donald Tusk.
Johnson had downplayed his chances of securing a new deal ahead of meetings with key EU leaders during the 
United Nations General Assembly.
After leaving their bilateral meeting on Monday, Tusk lamented that there had been "no breakthrough" and that 
there is "no time to lose" with the October 31 deadline looming.
The PM had told Tusk that the UK needs "to see movement and flexibility from the EU" in order to reach a deal, 
according to Downing Street.
An EU source said the meeting was "sincere and open" but stressed that there were "big gaps in substance".
The economic events calendar on Tuesday has UK public sector borrowing figures at 0930 BST.

LONDON BRIEFING: TUI More Concerned By Airline Market Than Thomas Cook
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson failed to achieve a "New York breakthrough" on Brexit in a meeting with European 
Council President Donald Tusk. Johnson had downplayed his chances of securing a new deal ahead of meetings 
with key EU leaders during the United Nations General Assembly. After leaving their bilateral meeting on Monday, 
Tusk lamented that there had been "no breakthrough" and that there is "no time to lose" with the October 31 
deadline looming.

The UK's highest court will give its historic ruling on Tuesday morning over the legality of the five-week suspension 
of Parliament. Prime Minister Johnson, who has been accused of an unlawful "abuse of power", will be in the US 
when the Supreme Court announces its findings, following an unprecedented hearing last week. Eleven justices 
have been asked to determine whether his advice to the Queen to prorogue Parliament, for what opponents 
describe as an "exceptionally long" period, was unlawful. The Supreme Court is going to give its decision at 1030 
BST. Johnson was asked whether he was nervous about the Supreme Court judgment in an interview in New York, 
and replied: "It takes a lot to make me nervous these days."

Japan's economy showed signs of "robust" growth in September, but suffered slowdowns in both its manufacturing 
and services sectors. The Jibun Bank flash composite purchasing managers' index reading decreased in 
September to 51.5 from 51.9 in August. "The resilience of Japan's service sector to the struggles of the country's 
manufacturers continued to shine through during September," said IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes. "As a result, 
it's looking like Japan will boast what will be a robust rate of growth in the current climate for the third quarter."
----------
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has expressed his gratitude to Germany, France and Britain, after the three 
countries released a joint statement saying Iran "bears responsibility" for the recent attack on a Saudi Arabian oil 
plant. "The US thanks our close friends, UK, France, and Germany, for their clear articulation of Iran's sole 
responsibility for the act of war against Saudi Arabia and its impact on the region and the world," Pompeo wrote on 
Twitter. Iran has denied involvement in the oil plant strike on September 14, which was claimed by Iranian-backed 
Houthi rebels in Yemen, but the US has doubted that narrative.

Soft drinks maker AG Barr said it is on course to deliver a full-year performance in line with its revised expectations, 
following a profit warning in July. For the six months to July 27, revenue fell to GBP122.5 million from GBP136.9 
million last year, and pretax profit declined to GBP13.5 million from GBP18.2 million. The company said it incurred 
exceptional costs associated with a restructuring programme which started during the period. AG Barr raised its 
interim dividend to 4 pence from 3.90 pence last year. "The first half of 2019 has been disappointing," the company 
LONDON BRIEFING: TUI More Concerned By Airline Market Than Thomas Cook
said. "However, it was always expected to be a year of pricing transition for the business which would lead to 
elevated levels of risk. We now have plans in place to address our specific brand related challenges and to ensure 
that the business is appropriately scaled to perform in the current market."

Merchant bank Close Brothers said it delivered a solid annual performance, as it also announced the departure of 
its chief executive. For the financial year ended July 31, net interest income rose to GBP505.7 million from 
GBP486.1 million last year and its loan book on July 31, was up 5.7% to GBP7.6 billion from GBP7.2 billion a year 
ago. The company's common equity tier one capital ratio increased to 13.0% and return on opening equity 
"remained strong" at 15.7%. Close Brothers is proposing a full-year dividend per share of 66.0p, up 5%. Close 
Brothers said Chief Executive Preben Prebensen will step down but remain with the firm for 12 months to ensure a 
smooth handover. The company has begun the search for a new CEO and is looking both internally and externally.

Thousands of stranded Thomas Cook Group passengers will be repatriated on Tuesday as the rescue operation 
continues into its second day. Holidaymakers were being brought home amid questions over the multimillion pound 
sums received by the bosses of the firm prior to its collapse. The conduct of the directors will come under the 
microscope as the Insolvency Services fast-tracks an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the company 
going into Liquidation. After that happened in the early hours of Monday, there was anger at other travel firms and 
airlines hiking their prices. Around 15,000 holidaymakers were flown home on an estimated 61 flights on Monday, 
after the travel company collapsed. Some 150,000 tourists will be brought home over the next two weeks in a UK 
Civil Aviation Authority flight programme costing GBP100 million.
----------
Metro Bank has been forced to withdraw a GBP200 million bond sale, the Financial Times reported. The challenger 
bank needs to raise new debt by the end of 2019 to meet EU regulations, the newspaper noted, but investor 
confidence has been knocked by the company's financial misreporting issue back in January. The FT said Metro 
Bank wanted to raise between GBP200 million to GBP250 million, but had only received GBP175 million of orders 
by mid-afternoon on Monday.

Anheuser-Busch InBev said it will proceed with the listing of its Asia Pacific subsidiary, Budweiser Brewing Co

189.4 million shares to meet market demand, bringing the total offering amount to 1.45 billion shares. After 
exercising this upsize option, Budweiser APAC's IPO is expected to raise HKD39.2 billion, or about USD5 billion. 
AB InBev will still hold an 89% interest in Budweiser APAC following the listing. The new shares are expected to 
begin trading in Hong Kong on September 30. AB InBev intends to apply all of the net proceeds from the offering to 
repay debt.

US aeroplane maker Boeing launched a compensation fund on Monday for the relatives of those who were killed in 
crashes involving the company's 737 MAX model in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The families of the 346 victims are 
each to receive USD144,500, according to a statement by the fund, which is managed by prominent US attorney

Ken Feinberg. Boeing said in July that it would set aside USD100 million in financial aid for the families, half of 
which is to be made available in the short term. Also on Monday, US Federal Aviation Administration said it would 
be up to individual countries to decide whether to give the green light again for the Boeing 737 MAX jet, over six 
months after the aircraft was grounded following a pair of deadly crashes. The FAA said "each government will 
make its own decision to return the aircraft to service, based on a thorough safety assessment."

An EU court is to rule in two illegal state aid cases on Tuesday, one involving the US coffee giant Starbucks in the

European Commission orders to compensate for unpaid taxes worth between EUR20 million to EUR30 million 
each. The EU executive, which acts as the bloc's competition watchdog, concluded that both EU member states 
had awarded the two multinationals illegal tax advantages.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday confirmed that its UK-based cabin crew have voted in favour 
of a four-year collective labour agreement, which will cover all of the budget airline's UK crew employees until 2023.
The UK crew, by a majority of 80%, voted in favour of the labour agreement, which will implement a new pay 
structure with increased guaranteed income and returning to a 5/3 roster.
The 5/3 roster consists of five days of early duty, followed by three days off, and five days of late duty followed by 
three days off. 
The agreement was negotiated between Ryanair and the trade union UNITE.
On Friday, the British Airline Pilots' Association, a trade union representing Ryanair's UK-based pilots, had called-
off five strikes scheduled for the rest of the September.  Ryanair, in response, welcomed Balpa's decision to call off 
the strikes and said it had invited Balpa to resume talks with the company.
Shares in Ryanair were up 2.0% at EUR10.25 on Tuesday morning.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened higher on Monday with competing travel stocks in the green as the 
curtain came down on UK's oldest travel company Thomas Cook.
The FTSE 100 was up 16.21 points, or 0.2%, at 7,361.13. The FTSE 250 was down 21.90 points, or 0.1%, at 
20,147.50. The AIM All-Share was up 2.64 points, or 0.3%, at 889.12.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 0.3% at 12,485.30. The Cboe UK 250 was down 0.1% at 18,047.89. The Cboe UK 
Small Companies was flat at 10,959.12.
In European equities, the CAC 40 index in Paris was down 0.6% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt down 0.5%.
In the FTSE 100, Anglo-German tour operator TUI was the best performer, up 8.1% in the wake of smaller rival 
Thomas Cook's collapse.
Thomas Cook ceased trading after failing to secure a last-ditch rescue deal, leaving an estimated 150,000 Britons 
abroad awaiting repatriation, akin to airline Monarch which collapsed a few years ago. 
"The effects will be felt across the sector, not all bad. On the Beach sees a one off hit from helping customers make 
alternative arrangements and from list margin on cancelled bookings. Meanwhile airlines are firmer today as they 
should feel the benefit from the abrupt loss of short-haul capacity. IAG, Ryanair and easyJet shares were all trading 
higher to different degrees," Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said. 
The troubled tour operator was unable to secure the extra GBP200 million needed to keep the business afloat 
following a full day of crucial talks with the major shareholder and creditors on Sunday. Thomas Cook shares were 
suspended from trading.
British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group was up 1.2%, while Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings 
was up 3.8%. easyJet was the best midcap performer, up 4.5%, also benefiting from HSBC raising the budget 
airline to Buy from Hold. 
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Travel Rivals Rise After Thomas Cook Collapse
J Sainsbury was up 0.2% after Deutsche Bank raised the supermarket chain to Buy from Hold. In addition, the 
Financial Times reported the grocer is set to exit mortgage lending in order to conserve capital and improve the 
profitability of its banking unit. 
Sainsbury's will hold its Capital Markets Day on Wednesday. 
At the other end of the midcap index, Marks & Spencer was down 1.4% after the food, clothing and homewares 
retailer said Humphrey Singer has decided to step down as chief financial officer and a succession plan is now 
underway. M&S said Singer's departure date has not yet been decided and will be confirmed in due course.
In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 1.0%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.8%. 
Financial markets in Japan were closed Monday for the Autumnal Equinox Day holiday.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2448 Monday morning, lower than USD1.2490 at the London equities close Friday.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson played down the chances of a "New York breakthrough" on Brexit during 
discussions with key EU leaders at the United Nations.
The prime minister is set to meet with Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, Donald Tusk and Leo Varadkar during 
the annual General Assembly in New York City.
Johnson will this week discuss his proposals for a new Brexit deal as the October 31 deadline looms.
He celebrated a "great deal of progress" having been made but sought to limit expectations when speaking to 
reporters on board the RAF Voyager on the way to JFK airport.
"There will be discussions about Brexit. I would caution you all not to think that this is not going to be the 
moment…there will be no New York…" he said.
Analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets said: "Brexit will inevitably dominate the UK news flow this week. But while 
Johnson will again cross paths with a number of EU leaders early in the week, and discussions will continue at 
official level, we certainly do not expect any significant breakthroughs in negotiation. 
"Indeed, the UK proposals sent to the European Commission last week were clearly unrealistic, being wholly 
incompatible with EU red lines with respect to avoiding border infrastructure on the island of Ireland. And 
submission of any meaningful proposal from the UK side seems highly unlikely, at least until next week’s 
Conservative Party conference has passed."
The economic events calendar on Monday has manufacturing and services PMI readings from the eurozone at 
0900 BST. Already out are the same readings from Germany and France.

(Alliance News) -  The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices on Monday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
TUI, up 6.6%. Shares in the Anglo-German tour operator were higher in the wake of smaller rival Thomas Cook's 
collapse. Thomas Cook declared bankruptcy on Monday after failing to secure a last-ditch rescue deal worth 
GBP200 million from private investors to avert collapse, triggering the UK's biggest repatriation since World War II 
to bring back stranded passengers. "Such a tragic collapse - one, if not solely brought about by Brexit, then 
certainly hastened by that ongoing mess - leaves plenty of money on the table for its sector peers, a fact that hasn't 
gone unnoticed by investors," said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was up 2.2% 
and Jet2-owner Dart Group was up 6.1%. 
----------
AstraZeneca, up 0.7%. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it has secured approval from European Union 
regulators to market Qtrilmet tablets for treating adults with type-2 diabetes. The approval from Committee for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency was based on data from five Phase III trials, 
the pharmaceutical company said. The trials evaluated combination of Forxiga, Onglyza and metformin in patients 
with inadequately-controlled type-2 diabetes. Qtrilmet tablets are a combination of Forxiga, Onglyza and metformin.

Marks & Spencer, down 4.5%. The food clothing and homewares retailer began life in the FTSE 250 by announcing 
Chief Financial Officer Humphrey Singer has decided to leave the group, however, his departure date has not yet 
been decided. A succession process is now underway, during which Singer will continue with his responsibilities, 
and work with Chief Executive Officer Steve Rowe to ensure an orderly transition. Singer has been part of M&S for 
a year since 2018, joining from electrical goods retailer Dixon Carphone, where he was finance director for four 
years from 2014 to 2018. "The departure of Marks & Spencer's finance director Humphrey Singer is the latest red 
flag from a business struggling to keep itself relevant in the modern retail world. Having only joined in 2018, 
Singer's exit could suggest there are tensions in the boardroom as the retailer tries to sharpen its proposition," said 
AJ Bell's Russ Mould. M&S was demoted to the midcap index as part of the latest FTSE Russell index review 
changes which took effect on Monday. 
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Northgate, up 4.8%. The vehicle hire and sales company said, prior to its annual general meeting, that Chair Avril 
Palmer-Baunack has commenced a strategic review. Northgate said the review will be focused on "clarifying the 
significant intrinsic value of Northgate", looking at both its core business and actions that could increase the 
company's scale and value. In addition, Northgate said it has refinanced its committed bank facilities. The company 
now has a facility of GBP557.5 million, comprising a GBP477.5 million multi-currency revolving credit facility due 
November 2023 and a GBP80 million term loan due November 2022. For the year ending April 30, 2020 to date, 
Northgate has traded in line with management expectations, it said, however it remains cautious in the face of 
continued Brexit-related political and economical uncertainty.
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
XLMedia, down 23%. The digital marketing services provider said interim earnings dropped as a result of 
operational issues and regulatory headwinds, affecting its outlook for 2019. For the six months to the end of June, 
XLMedia's pretax profit dropped by 22% to USD13.8 million from USD17.6 million the year before, on revenue that 
declined by 10% to USD42.5 million from USD47.2 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortisation decreased by 14% to USD18.6 million from USD21.6 million the prior year. XLMedia attributed the 
weaker performance to regulatory changes in the gambling industry, leading to a delayed recovery in market 
performance, as gambling operators cease their activities in certain markets or limit the deposits they can accept 
from players. Regulatory changes include new gambling legislation in Sweden and a new regulatory regime for 
online casinos in Switzerland. XLMedia also cited revenue pressure in the online German casino sector due to 
regulatory uncertainty and in the UK from an "evolving" regulatory landscape.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday said the UK pilots trade union has cancelled five strikes 
scheduled in the rest of the month. 
The British Airline Pilots’ Association originally announced that pilots would strike this Saturday, then again on 
Monday and Wednesday before striking again on September 27 and September 29. 
The budget airline operator said it had welcomed Balpa's decision to call off the strike and "has invited Balpa to 
resume talks in East Midlands or in Dublin, at Balpa's convenience, next week".
On Thursday, the union took aim at Ryanair for "reverting to type" for threatening its pilots with the withdrawal of 
benefits if they took part in a strike. 
Balpa also said on Wednesday that pilots at International Consolidated Airlines Group Sa-owned British Airways 
called off strikes scheduled for September 27. 
Shares in Ryanair were 2.5% higher at EUR10.17 each in London on Friday afternoon.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Thursday reported a number of expressions of 
shareholder dissatisfaction, with almost half rejecting its remuneration report.
Some 49% of shareholders at Thursday's annual general meeting rejected the remuneration report, which passed 
with 50.5% in favour, Ryanair said. 
Other dissent included 30% voting against the re-appointment of Non-Executive Director Howard Millar, 29% 
rejecting Non-Executive Director Kyran McLaughlin, 25% rejecting Non-Executive Chair David Bonderman, and 
22% opposing Non-Executive Director Michael Cawley. 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, however, received the backing of 98% of shareholders.
Some 29% of shareholders rejected Ryanair's resolution to allow it to allot shares, and 21% rejected the 2019 long-
term incentive plan. 
The company commented: "Ryanair is, and will continue to, consult with its shareholders, and we will report back to 
them over the coming year on how the board will adapt its decision making to reflect their advice and input on all 
these topics."
Ryanair has suffered a rocky few months, with British pilots striking this week, on Wednesday and Thursday, and 
five more one-day strikes are planned in the rest of September. 
There have been numerous disagreements with pilots unions across Europe, with a deal last week reached in 
Germany, having agreed one in Belgium in May. Other countries that have gone on strike include Ireland, Portugal, 
and Spain. 
Ryanair Shareholders Voice Opposition To Remuneration, Directors
Ryanair in July reported a 24% drop in pretax profit for the three months to June, with the company operating in a 
difficult market due to issues such as rising fuel costs and Brexit.
In March, Ryanair decided all shares held by non-EU shareholders, including those held by UK shareholders, were 
to lose their right to attend, speak, or vote at company meetings. The ban on non-EU nationals buying shares, 
which has been in place since 2002, was extended to include UK citizens. The Irish airline's board implemented the 
resolutions to protect the company in the case of a no-deal Brexit. 
Ryanair shares were flat on Thursday morning in London at EUR9.89 each.

(Alliance News) - The head of Ryanair said he fears that the budget airline's growth plans will be further disrupted 
by delays in deliveries of aircraft from US manufacturer Boeing, which is still grappling with its 737 MAX planes 
being banned from the air.
Boeing's 737 MAX series was grounded in March after two crashes involving the MAX 8 variants, one in March in 
Ethiopia that killed 157 people and another in Indonesia in October that killed 189.
The cause of the crashes appears to be linked to a software malfunction.
The delivery of planes ordered by Ryanair could be delayed into 2020, said Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary at the 
annual general meeting of the airline on Thursday in Dublin.
Ryanair might not receive the first aircraft in the delivery until March or April, O'Leary said, adding that Ryanair has 
stopped its payments to Boeing and is in negotiations with the US manufacturer to receive compensation.
Ryanair will have to curb its growth plans even further if there are extended delays, O'Leary said.
The Irish airline has a contract with Boeing to order up to 210 of its Boeing 737s, including MAX models.
O'Leary already announced plans to tone down the company's growth strategy in response to the Boeing MAX 
crisis and Britain's imminent exit from the EU. The company is also dealing with potential strike action from pilots in 
Britain and Spain.
He also talked about job cuts mentioned earlier this year. Around 500 to 700 roles are expected to be slashed.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.9% at EUR9.80 pence in London on Thursday afternoon.

In European equities, the CAC 40 index in Paris was down 0.6% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt down 0.5%.
On the London Stock Exchange, heavyweight oil majors were leading a handful of blue-chip risers, tracking spot oil 
prices higher.
BP was up 3.7%. Royal Dutch Shell 'A' and B' shares were up 3.1% and 2.9%, respectively. Shell is London's 
largest company by market capitalisation, while BP is the third largest. 
In addition, midcap oil stocks Premier Oil, Hunting and Cairn Energy were up 11%, 5.1% and 4.9%, respectively. 
Brent was quoted at USD65.29 a barrel Monday morning, up 8.2% from USD60.32 late Friday. 
The price of oil increased significantly following drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil production facilities on Saturday.
The drone attacks on Saturday, which caused fires at two facilities operated by Saudi state oil giant Aramco in the 
eastern province of Buqyaq, was claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, but the US has blamed Iran for the attacks.
Buqyaq is home to the world's largest oil refining plant, according to Aramco.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Oil Majors Rise As Brent Crude Spikes
US President Donald Trump announced late Sunday that he has approved the release of resources from the US 
strategic petroleum reserve "if needed".
Conversely, British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group was the worst blue-chip performer, 
down 2.5%. Higher crude oil prices hurt airlines as jet fuel prices are linked to international oil prices.
Midcap peer easyJet was down 3.3%, while Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was down 3.7%.
In the FTSE 250, Tullow Oil was the best performer, up 11% after the oil and gas firm said it made another oil 
discovery on the Orinduik block in Guyana.
Drilling at the Joe-1 exploration well confirmed 14 metres of net oil pay in the Upper Tertiary age. This is the first 
discovery in the Upper Tertiary, Tullow said.
Tullow and partners will now look at the Joe-1 data alongside that from the Jethro-1 discovery made in August. The 
"significant" discovery at Jethro found 55 metres of net oil pay in the Lower Tertiary. 
The pound was quoted at USD1.2461 Monday morning, firm against USD1.2455 at the London equities close 
Friday. 
The price of new properties on the UK market fell in September, as normally eager buyers hesitate due uncertainty 
caused by the looming Brexit deadline, according to Rightmove.
The Rightmove Monthly House Price index revealed that the price of newly marketed property fell by an average of 
0.2% in September from a year before. Although underlying housing market fundamentals remain sound, according 
to Rightmove, Brexit uncertainty has caused some buyers to hesitate.
In China, the Shanghai Composite closed flat, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 1.0%. Financial 
markets in Japan were closed on Monday for the Respect for the Aged Day holiday.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC passengers were left unable to check in ahead of their flights due to a 
"systems outage" which caused delays at airports across Europe.
Twitter users complained of "chaos" at Stansted Airport on Saturday morning, with many struggling to find their 
booking details online.
The budget airline confirmed that the outage resulted in disruption to airport check-ins and boarding.
Meanwhile, photographs posted on social media from Rome Ciampino airport in Italy show large queues forming at 
the Ryanair check-in desks.
A spokesman for Ryanair said: "This morning we suffered a system outage which caused  some short delays at 
airport check-in and boarding.
"The system has been restored and flights are operating as normal. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."
Many of the people who posted on Twitter complained they could not find their flight bookings on the budget 
airline's mobile app or website.
Ryanair states on its website that people who do not check-in online will be charged GBP55 per passenger to do so 
at the airport counter.
A spokesman for Stansted Airport said: "There was a short disruption to some of Ryanair's systems earlier today at 
Stansted.
"No other airlines have reported problems this morning."

The pact covers all of the budget airline's directly employed pilots in Germany through to March 2023 and will 
deliver a new pay structure including a fixed 4/5 roster.
Moreover, Ryanair and VC have agreed to a social plan which will govern the closure or reduction of German 
bases. 
The social plan and collective labour agreement "will now be put to a ballot of Ryanair's pilots in Germany".
The news follows strikes by the Ryanair pilots in the UK. This includes members of the British Airline Pilots 
Association, which has planned further walkouts and stoppages over pay, pension, and maternity benefit disputes.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC pilots are to stage a fresh round of strikes in a dispute over a range of 
issues including pay, pensions and maternity benefits.
Members of the British Airline Pilots Association have already taken strike action on August 22 and 23 as well as 
the first part of this week.
The union announced a 48-hour walkout on September 18 and 19 and 24-hour stoppages on September 21, 23, 
25, 27 and 29.
The union accused the company of refusing to take part in talks at the conciliation service Acas.
General Secretary Brian Strutton said: "We are clear that we want to settle the dispute and bring about a change in 
Ryanair for the better.
"Pilots in Ryanair are seeking the same kind of policies and agreements that exist in other airlines, our demands 
are not unreasonable.
"We want to address issues like pensions, loss of licence insurance, maternity benefits, allowances and harmonise 
pay across the UK in a fair, transparent, and consistent structure.
"While this action has considerably disrupted Ryanair, forcing them to engage contractors and bring in foreign 
crews to run its operation, it has had limited impact on the public's travel plans.
"Ryanair should stop dragging its feet and get back to the negotiating table."
Shares in Ryanair closed 2.5% higher in London on Wednesday at EUR9.31 each.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair PLC will shut four bases in Spain putting 500 jobs at risk as part of its 
wider cost-cutting programme, a local trade union told Reuters on Friday.
Union Sindical Obrera told the news wire the Irish airline confirmed in an email to the union it would close its bases 
in Las Palmas, Tenerife South, Lanzarote and Girona from January 2020. 
The USO explained this could potentially result in the loss of over 500 jobs across pilots and cabin crew. The email 
from Ryanair also announced it would launch a collective dismissal process. 
Last week, Ryanair had confirmed to Reuters that it planned to close its base at Faro International Airport in 
Portugal as well as two on the Canary Islands. It had cautioned, however, that a final decision on how many had not 
been made. 
Las Palmas, Tenerife and Lanzarote are all part of the Canary Islands. Meanwhile, Girona is a city located in the 
north-west of the Spanish mainland - near to the French border.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC flew an almost full service on Thursday, the Irish airline said despite strikes 
by pilots and cabin crew based in Britain and Portugal triggered by pay disputes.
"All first wave flights to and from UK airports departed as scheduled this morning, with 97% punctuality," Ryanair 
said in a statement, adding that the minimal disruption was due to air traffic control delays.
"We do not expect any disruptions to our flights to/from our UK airports today," it added.
Meanwhile in Portugal, the only delay was to a flight from Porto to Milan, which was put back until the afternoon.
Pilots in Britain were striking Thursday and Friday, while cabin crew in Portugal were on their second day of a five-
day walkout.
Ryanair's Britain-based pilots won permission late Wednesday to strike following a ruling by London's High Court 
after the Irish carrier demanded it be blocked.
However the High Court in Dublin has prevented Ireland-based pilots from joining the walkout.
In Portugal, disruption has been limited after the country's government ordered workers to deliver at least a 
minimum service.
Ryanair cabin crew in Spain have called for ten days of strikes in September.
The minimal fallout from the strikes contrasts to last year when pan-European stoppages affected thousands of 
passengers – and led to Ryanair offering improved pay to staff via landmark deals with unions.
But Irish union Forsa claims its 2018 agreement was limited to matters of the time only.
Ryanair Planes Take To Skies Despite European Strikes
Ryanair claims Forsa has not outlined specific pay demands, has been hasty in their movement to strike and 
conducted the strike ballot improperly.
The strikes come as the Dublin-based carrier faces several headwinds that are cutting into its growth and profits.
Ryanair's first-quarter net profits sank by more than one-fifth on rising costs, intense competition and Brexit turmoil 
– issues that continue to affect the budget airline that flies mainly throughout Europe.
Against this backdrop, Ryanair recently slashed its growth outlook and is temporarily shutting bases, also as crisis-
hit Boeing pushes back plane delivery owing to fatal crashes that grounded its 737 MAX jets.

(Alliance News) - The Dublin High Court has approved an application by Ryanair Holdings PLC to stop a proposed 
pilot strike on Thursday and Friday.
Justice McDonald told Dublin High Court that he would approve an application for an injunction to prevent around 
180 pilots in Ireland undertaking a 48-hour strike action over pay conditions beginning on Thursday.
He said he was restraining the pilots' union Forsa "from directly or indirectly, organising, directing or endorsing their 
members to participate in a strike on August 22 or 23".
The court action taken by the airline against Forsa and a number of named pilots started on Monday morning.
The legal arguments surrounded whether an agreement signed in the summer of 2018 through mediation at the 
Workplace Relations Commission was an "over-arching agreement" that covered pay conditions as well as seniority 
and annual leave.
Ryanair argued that the 2018 agreement covered issues surrounding salary, However, Forsa said that the previous 
agreement only covered the issues that arose at that particular time.
Martin Hayden SC, appearing for the airline, told the court in Dublin he found it "extraordinary" that the union 
claimed the 2018 agreement signed by both parties does not cover pay, and the union had shown "complete 
indifference" to resolving the dispute which will affect "hundreds of customers".
Forsa told the court that Ryanair has been "curt and dismissive" of a 30-page proposal it submitted to the company 
on pay and conditions, and at one point stated that the submission had "no basis in reality".
Their affidavit stated that Ryanair has no basis to apply for an injunction to stop strike action, as the previous 
agreement signed by both parties in summer 2018 was "not a full collective agreement".
UPDATE: Dublin High Court Approves Ryanair Bid To Prevent Pilot Strike
Meanwhile, the British Airline Pilots' Association said on Monday that because Ryanair has "wasted time with 
unnecessary court action", their chance to resolve the dispute involving their pilots has been lost.
Ryanair began seeking a High Court injunction on Wednesday to stop strike action by their UK pilots.
Ryanair shares were trading 0.9% higher in London on Wednesday at EUR8.67 each.

(Alliance News) - A Portuguese labour union announced a strike at Ryanair Holdings PLC as courts in Ireland and 
Britain are due to rule on requests by the Ireland-based budget airline to prevent labour action there.
In Portugal, the union for cabin crew members called a five-day strike starting on Wednesday, Portuguese news 
agency Lusa reported.
Last year, strikes by Ryanair staff across Europe resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the height of 
the summer holiday season in August and September.
On Thursday and Friday Irish and British pilots are also seeking to take part in labour action in an effort to obtain 
better pay and work conditions.
A judge in London is set to hear an application by Ryanair to block the strike by its Britain-based pilots later 
Wednesday, British news agency PA reported.
The British pilots also plan to strike on a series of dates in September.
Similarly, a High Court ruling is due in Ireland on Wednesday, according to Irish public broadcaster RTE.
The airline is also seeking an injunction there to prevent pilots based in Ireland from striking on Thursday and 
Friday.
Strikes could cause flight cancellations or delays in Europe, the airline said.
For Portugal, Ryanair does not expect any considerable disruptions because the airline has already arranged a 
minimal flight plan, which is required by the government, Lusa reported.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has lost a High Court bid to block strike action by its UK pilots – hours after 
winning a similar legal move in Dublin.
A judge sitting in London on Wednesday rejected an urgent application by the airline for an injunction against the 
British Airline Pilots' Association.
The decision by Justice Lambert came after Ryanair succeeded at the High Court in Dublin earlier on Wednesday 
in its bid to prevent pilots based in Ireland from going on a 48-hour strike from midnight on Thursday.
The airline sought an urgent injunction from the judge in London just hours before the start of threatened industrial 
action by members of Balpa in a dispute over pay and conditions.
After hearing submissions from Ryanair and Balpa, the judge dismissed the various grounds raised by the airline.
Strike action by UK Ryanair pilots is due to take place on Thursday and Friday this week, with a second round of 
dates in September.
Paul Gott QC, for Ryanair, told Justice Lambert during the hearing that strike action could be "enormously 
disruptive", and Ryanair would suffer "significant reputational" damage.
Gott submitted that Balpa had not conducted a ballot which complied with the requirements of labour relations 
legislation.
But Andrew Burns QC, representing Balpa, accused Ryanair of raising "trivial and immaterial technicalities", and 
argued that it was "readily apparent" that the union had "substantially complied" with legislative obligations.
After Justice Lambert's ruling, Balpa said she had rejected Ryanair's "various technical and legal arguments", and 
agreed that the union's industrial action ballot and procedures were lawful, "and so the strike can proceed".
UPDATE: Ryanair Fails In High Court Bid To Block Strikes By UK Pilots
Balpa said it has responded to the legal victory "by offering an olive branch to Ryanair – a framework to allow 
constructive negotiations to take place and if agreed by Ryanair will avoid the need for strikes".
Brian Strutton, the union's general secretary, said: "Ryanair was foolish to bring this into the High Court rather than 
the negotiating room.
"We offered to meet Ryanair management at Acas to negotiate a resolution, but instead they attempted a legal 
bludgeon. That's backfired.
"However, we are clear that we want to settle the dispute and bring about a change in Ryanair for the better.
"Pilots in Ryanair are seeking the same kind of policies and agreements that exist in other airlines – our demands 
are not unreasonable. We want to address issues like pensions; loss of licence insurance; maternity benefits; 
allowances; and harmonise pay across the UK in a fair, transparent, and consistent structure.
"We hope that Ryanair will take up our offer of a way forward this evening so we can call off this action. We urge 
Ryanair to change their attitude to dealing with us, and adopt a constructive approach.
"In the event that Ryanair rejects our overture and therefore the action over the next two days does go ahead, we 
apologise to the passengers who will be affected. Such action could have been avoided if Ryanair adopts a different 
approach."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is going to the High Court in a bid to block strike action by its UK pilots.
An application by the airline for an injunction is to be heard by a judge in London on Wednesday.
The proceedings before Justice Lambert come just hours before industrial action is due to start by members of the 
British Airline Pilots Association in a dispute over pay and conditions.
The union said earlier this week that because Ryanair "has wasted time with unnecessary court action,  their 
chance to resolve the dispute involving their pilots has been lost".
It added: "Instead Ryanair is relying on legal technicalities to try to persuade the High Court to block the strike.
"Ryanair is seeking a High Court injunction on Wednesday to stop strike action by UK Ryanair pilots, due to take 
place on Thursday and Friday this week, with a second round of dates in September."
Balpa General Secretary Brian Strutton said: "Ryanair pilots in the UK have a serious dispute with their company 
which will not be resolved by raising legal technicalities in the High Court.
"Their attempt to block lawful strike action is just another demonstration of the bullying tactics the airline appears to 
favour.
"It means all the time that could have been used to try to find a resolution will now be spent preparing for the court 
action.
"It's also worrying to see Ryanair continue to sell tickets for strike days – are they prepared to offer compensation to 
passengers if they are affected?
"I think they should tell passengers exactly where they stand."
Ryanair Launches Court Action In Bid To Block Strikes By UK Pilots
Ryanair said in a statement on Tuesday: "Balpa, who represent a small number of highly paid UK pilots should not 
be disrupting the return holiday flights of UK families later this week when Ryanair Captains already earn 
GBP180,000 p.a and are now seeking unjustified pay increases of between 65% to 121%."
Members of Balpa voted by four to one to back a campaign of action on a 72% turnout.
As well as the legal move in London,  Ryanair has this week sought an order at the High Court in Dublin to prevent 
around 180 pilots based in Ireland from going on a 48-hour strike from midnight on Thursday.
That application was contested by Forsa, which is the parent union of the Irish Airline Pilots Association, and a 
judge is expected to give a ruling on Wednesday morning.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair passengers face another day of waiting for travel confirmation as court action against a 
potential pilot strike continues into its second day.
High Court action, taken by the airline against pilots' union Forsa and a number of named pilots to prevent a strike 
later this week, continued on Tuesday, with Ryanair's senior counsel Martin Hayden continuing his argument, which 
started on Monday morning.
The row between the parties centres around an ongoing issue surrounding pay for some 180 pilots in Ireland, who 
balloted for strike action earlier this month. The action is proposed to begin at 12.01am on Thursday and last for 48 
hours.
Hayden told the court in Dublin he finds it "extraordinary" that the union is claiming a 2018 Workplace Relations 
Commission agreement signed by both parties does not cover pay, and the union has shown "complete 
indifference" to resolving the dispute which will affect "hundreds of customers".
"If the court looks at agreement, this is why I find my friend's affidavit extraordinary, that claims this this agreement 
does not cover pay," Hayden said.
"Through a mediation process, at the instruction of the union, they signed up to an agreement, with a mechanism 
for the use of the services of Mulvey (mediator), who gives directions and ultimately during the process has three 
meetings on pay, and yet this affidavit says it has nothing to do with pay. If that is the case, what was Mulvey 
doing?
"There are passengers at this moment not knowing whether they're going or if they're coming back."
Passengers Wait As Court Action Against Ryanair Pilot Strike Continues
Hayden's submission went on to early afternoon on Tuesday before Justice McDonald – who informed Hayden on a 
number of occasions that time was of the essence in this case – stopped Hayden mid-sentence repeatedly in an 
effort to move him on.
"Can we please move on?" Justice McDonald said.
"It's 25 minutes past 12 and you're looking for decision before midnight on Thursday – please keep that in mind."
Forsa says Ryanair has been "curt and dismissive" of a 30-page proposal they submitted to the company on pay 
and conditions, and at one point stated that the submission had "no basis in reality".
Their affidavit stated that Ryanair has no basis to apply for an injunction to stop strike action, as the previous 
agreement signed by both parties in summer 2018 is "not a full collective agreement".
Forsa says there has been a "fundamental misunderstanding" by Ryanair of the agreement, and the airline showed 
"no desire to engage in a reasonable manner with the pay proposal".
Justice McDonald says the hearing must finish today, and he expects to have a decision late on Tuesday or early 
Wednesday morning.
Shares in Ryanair were 3.3% lower in London on Tuesday afternoon at EUR8.57 each.

(Alliance News) - Only a dozen airlines will eventually share the aviation market for major international routes, 
predicted the chief executive officer of Lufthansa AG, while a possible future economic crisis could "accelerate" a 
consolidation in air travel.
"The sector is evolving towards a dozen companies operating worldwide" on major international routes, in addition 
to smaller national or regional airlines, Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr told reporters late Monday.
Without naming them, Spohr forecasted there would be "three in the US, three in China, three in the Gulf and three 
in Europe".
The Lufthansa chief executive warned that any future economic crisis could hit European airlines particularly hard, 
but predicted a downturn could "accelerate" mergers and acquisitions.
"If there is one positive aspect to the flattening of the global economy, and certainly also the worsening figures for 
all airlines – unfortunately also for us – it is that the consolidation process will tend to accelerate," Spohr added.
The recent bankruptcies of German low-cost airlines Air Berlin and Germania have enabled Lufthansa to buy back 
flight routes and aircraft.
The airline industry is "much more cyclical" and at the mercy of economic developments than others, Spohr said, 
with the sector suffering from international trade tensions.
Lufthansa wants to "and will play an active role" in any future consolidation in the sector, said the airline boss, 
whose company's net profit dropped by 70% in the second quarter.
Spohr said Lufthansa faced strong competition from low-cost airlines in a "unique price war", however "we will not 
be driven out of our domestic market" by low-cost companies such as Ryanair Holdings PLC, because the German 
airline "has the financial strength to resist" competition.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has argued in Dublin's High Court that balloted strike action from some of 
their pilots was unlawful.
The High Court in Dublin is hearing arguments from a major Irish pilots' union and Ryanair in a debate over 
proposed strike action.
The airline is seeking an order against Forsa, which is the parent union of the Irish Airline Pilots Association, in a 
dispute over pay and conditions.
Forsa is contesting the airline's application for an injunction preventing around 180 pilots based in Ireland from 
going on a 48-hour strike from midnight on Thursday.
Justice Denis McDonald began hearing arguments on Monday from Ryanair's legal team Martin Hayden SC.
The airline claims strike action would be in breach of an agreement both parties signed up to in the summer of 2018 
through mediation in the Workplace Relations Commission through then-chairman Kieran Mulvey.
The airline also argues that Forsa's ballot and the subsequent notice of strike action was unlawful, and that the 
2018 agreement is a "binding conclusion".
Hayden told the court that Forsa has not actually quantified what it is claiming for to the airline, despite the fact they 
were supposed to confirm such information before preparing ballots for strike action.
Hayden said the strike would not only affect Ryanair as a company, but many customers.
"If I could say this, this is ultimately a pay request...that the go-to moment is a strike, it's a disproportionate 
response," he said.
Marguerite Bolger SC is appearing for the defendants.
Ryanair Claims Strike Action Ballot By Pilots Was Unlawful
Forsa says 94% of its members who took part in the vote chose to back a strike.
Only pilots directly employed by Ryanair took part in the ballot, with those on agency contracts not eligible to vote.
If strike action does go ahead, only those with Ryanair contracts will take part and pilots on different contracts will 
continue to work as normal.
It is predicted that any industrial action will cause huge disruption during the busy summer holiday period.
The hearing is expected to last for most of the day.
Meanwhile, the British Airline Pilots Association said on Monday that because Ryanair has "wasted time with 
unnecessary court action", their chance to resolve the dispute involving their pilots has been lost.
Ryanair is seeking a High Court injunction on Wednesday in England to stop strike action by UK Ryanair pilots.
Shares in Ryanair were up 2.6% at EUR8.84 in London on Monday.

(Alliance News) - Spanish unions representing Ryanair cabin crew said on Wednesday they plan to strike for ten 
days across September. 
The strikes are planned for September 1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 and 28, the Union Sindical Obrera and 
Sindicato Independiente de Tripulantes de Cabina de Pasajeros de Lineas Aereas said. The strike is to prevent the 
closure of the Gran Canaria, Tenerife South and Girona bases.
If there is no agreement in the next few days, the unions will formally call for the strike. Jairo Gonzalo, secretary of 
the USO-Ryanair Organization, was doubtful over Ryanair's willingness to reach an agreement.
This threat of industrial action comes just days after Irish Ryanair pilots voted in favour of striking over pay. 
Meanwhile, British Ryanair pilots will strike from August 22 until August 23 and from September 2 until September 
4.

(Alliance News) - Irish pilots of Ryanair Holdings PLC have voted in favour of industrial action over pay, trade union 
Forsa said on Friday.
Shares in Ryanair were down 3.0% at EUR8.92 in London in afternoon trade.
Around 180 pilots directly employed by the budget airline in Ireland, and who are members of the Irish Air Line 
Pilots' Association, were eligible to vote. A 94% majority favoured the industrial action.
The Forsa announcement follows that of the British Airline Pilots Association, which is also planning strikes after an 
industrial action vote. The British strikes will take place from August 22 until August 23 and from September 2 until 
September 4.
Forsa said it submitted a pay claim to Ryainair in late March in which it sought "pay levels and structures that are in 
line with sector norms". 
However, according to the union, the airline's "management has stalled in negotiations on pay and related matters" 
since the pay claim was submitted.
Ian McDonnell, assistant general secretary at Forsa, said: "Ryanair's directly-employed Irish-based pilots are simply 
seeking pay levels that are common and competitive in the commercial airline sector, from a company that made a 
more-than-healthy profit of EUR1 billion last year."
"They feel they have been forced into contemplating potentially-disruptive industrial action by a company that 
seems either unwilling or unable to negotiate in a professional and constructive manner. At this stage, only a 
substantive counter-proposal, which properly addresses all areas of our claim, will be enough to prevent us serving 
notice of industrial action next week."
TOP NEWS: More Bad News For Ryanair As Irish Pilots Ok Strike Action
Forsa is required to give a week's strike notice and McDonnell has said industrial action is avoidable if Ryanair 
engages "professionally and constructively in talks".
Forsa will not issue a further comment before next week so that Ryanair can "respond to its claim".

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair PLC will shut its base at Faro International Airport in Portugal from 2020, a 
local cabin crew union told Reuters on Wednesday.
The news wire explained the SNPVAC union was told by the Irish airline the Faro base will close in the summer of 
2020 as part of its wider cost-cutting programme. 
SNPVAC Director Fernando Gandra said the timing of the announcement "appears at least strange as it comes 
within days of our calling a strike in Portugal and as the company is telling staff its passenger numbers have risen 
9% in July from a year earlier."
The union has called a strike from August 21 to 25. This was after Ryanair refused to comply with a protocol signed 
in November regarding holiday pay and leave as well as compliance with the Potuguese parental law.  
"We are looking into the matter and collecting data to see if it could be retaliation for the strike," Gandra added.

(Alliance News) - Pilots at Ryanair Holdings PLC are to stage a series of strikes after voting in favour of industrial 
action in a dispute over pay and conditions.
Ryanair shares closed 4.3% higher in London on Wednesday at EUR9.42 each. 
Members of the British Airline Pilots Association voted by 4-1 to back a campaign of action on a 72% turnout.
Strikes will be held from August 22 until August 23 and from September 2 until September 4.
A union statement said: "Decades of Ryanair refusing to deal with unions has resulted in two things. Firstly, a 
management that apparently doesn't understand how to work with unions, and secondly a company that doesn't 
have a number of standard agreements that any union would reasonably expect in any workplace.
"That is why our claim includes many issues including pensions; loss of license insurance; maternity benefits; 
allowances; and a fair, transparent, and consistent pay structure.
"We have made no progress with Ryanair management on any of those areas at all, seemingly because Ryanair 
management cannot understand how to go about working with us constructively, or how to negotiate. Ryanair has 
made no offer to the British Airline Pilots Association in respect of its pilots."
Brian Strutton, the British Airline Pilots Association's general secretary, said: "We have had no formal offer from 
Ryanair and it is imperative that we resolve this dispute urgently to avoid strike action. No pilot wants to spoil the 
public's travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice."

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday reported strong customer growth in July, 
reaching nearly 15 million passengers in the month.
In July, Ryanair carried 14.8 million passengers, 9% higher than July 2018. The Ryanair brand's numbers rose 8% 
to 14.2 million, with Lauda up 20% to 600,000. 
On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair's passenger numbers to July rose 10% to 148.2 million. 
Ryanair operated 81,000 scheduled flights during the month, it added. 
Last week, the Irish airline's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary announced up to 900 jobs could be cut, as increased 
fuel costs continue to hurt profit. Further problems have come by the grounding of Boeing Co's 737 MAX following 
two fatal accidents. 
Ryanair shares were down 0.1% on Tuesday morning at a price of EUR9.17 each.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC must pay back EUR8.5 million of illegal aid received from the French state, 
the European Commission said on Friday.
Ryanair and its subsidiary AMS received funds to promote on its website Montpellier and its environs as a tourist 
destination from the publicly-funded French tourism association APFTE, the commission found.
Between 2010 and 2017, these payments "gave Ryanair an unfair and selective advantage over its competitors" 
and also harmed other airports, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.
The investigation into Ryanair's marketing activities for Montpellier Airport, which saw a footfall of close to 1.9 
million in 2019, was launched last year after a complaint from a competitor. As of April, the Irish airline no longer 
flies from Montpellier.
Last November, French authorities briefly impounded a Ryanair plane at Bordeaux airport to force the airline to pay 
another fine.
In 2014, the commission ordered Ryanair to repay EUR868,000 in the case of the Angouleme airport near to 
Bordeaux, EUR2.4 million in the case of the Pau airport, and EUR6.4 million in the case of the Nimes airport.

(Alliance News) - Budge airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is set to axe up to 900 jobs amid a drop in earnings due to 
higher fuel costs.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary told staff in a video message that the airline will do its best to minimise job cuts, 
but some were "unavoidable".
Ryanair is being hit by delays to expansion plans forced by the grounding of Boeing Co's 737 Max jetliner.
It is believed details of redundancies will be given by the end of August, with any cuts to be enforced later in the 
year.
Ryanair indicated earlier this month that it would trim operations, saying it expected to get no more than 30 of the 
58 Max jets due from Boeing by next summer.
The airline this week reported a 21% fall in quarterly profits as overcapacity and a price war in Germany drove ticket 
prices lower.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Monday that its first quarter operating revenue rose year-on-year, 
but its pretax profit fell due to increased costs.
In the period ended June 30, the Irish budget airline posted a pretax profit of EUR262.3 million, down 24% from 
GBP345.4 million. Its total operating revenue rose 11% year-on-year to EUR2.31 billion from EUR2.08 billion 
however. 
Fuel and oil costs, its largest, rose to EUR784.0 million from EUR631.0 million from the same period last year with 
staff costs airport handling charges and maintenance fees also increasing.
Ryanair has continued to guide broadly flat full year pretax profit between EUR750.0 million and EUR950.0 million. 
The company also said that it has delayed the delivery of its first five Boeing 737-MAX aircraft to January, it was 
initially scheduled to be delivered during the first quarter.
Ryanair anticipates the current weak fare environment during the first quarter to continue to the second quarter, 
causing its first half fares to be down 6%, it said. 
The company said it nominated Louise Phelan to take over as senior independent director next summer following 
Kyran McLaughlin's retirement from the board.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair's first-quarter results were not as bad as feared, despite the large drop in profit, said 
Liberum.
In the three-month period ended June 30, the Irish budget airline posted a pretax profit of EUR262.3 million, down 
24% from GBP345.4 million a year before. Total operating revenue rose 11% year-on-year to EUR2.31 billion from 
EUR2.08 billion, however. 
The fall in profit reflected challenging conditions in the markets that Ryanair serves, with those cited "unsurprisingly" 
including Germany, due to industry capacity growth following the demise of Air Berlin, and the UK, due to Brexit, 
said Liberum.
Net profit of EUR242.9 million was down 21% year-on-year, but 5% ahead of consensus and 3% ahead of 
Liberum's EUR235.4 million forecast. 
Compared with estimates, ticket revenue was "slightly light", but ancillary sales better than anticipated, up 14% per 
passenger, driven by fees charged for priority boarding and seat selection.
Underlying net debt ex-IFRS 16 was better than the first quarter last year, which Liberum put down to the timing of 
capital expenditure and the impact of suspended payments to Boeing while 737 MAX deliveries are on hold.
Ryanair continues to trade on a premium to European airline peers, on a price to earnings ratio of 13.3 times. 
Liberum said it continues to see this as justified given Ryanair's market leadership, strong track record and robust 
balance sheet. 
"We would view any potential short-term share price weakness as a buying opportunity in the
long-term structural winner in the European short-haul aviation market," said Liberum.

EUR10.10 on Monday in London.

for airlines in Europe, given their progress in operating in a potentially highly challenging future.
"Capital expenditure is peaking at the wrong time, making further capacity cuts potentially necessary to preserve 
cash. More concentrated long haul markets (and the Transatlantic in particular, given market structure and US point 
of sale) are more likely to produce robust pricing than short haul routes, and this drives our continued preference for 
IAG as our top pick," the analysts said. 
Glynn and Truslove said the global airline sector is a highly cyclical space, and the performance of the sector is 
strongly influenced by sentiment towards global demand developments.
"In a weak macro environment, the higher-margin players typically outperform the lower-margin players. We think 
this is the lens investors should consider the sector through, and we think a strong self-help story is required to rise 
above this operating leverage-driven dynamic. IAG is now the highest-margin business among the top five 
European carriers, followed by Ryanair," the pair said. 
Credit Suisse downgraded Ryanair Holdings to Underperform from Neutral and cut its price target to EUR9.31 from 
EUR11.21. The stock was up 0.2% at EUR10.38 in London on Tuesday.
The Swiss bank's analysts said Ryanair shares have outperformed London-listed peers easyJet and International 
Consolidated Airlines so far this year, but cut the stock over concerns about margin management given potential 
pricing fragility and inflationary pressures. 
Last week, Ryanair had said it expects Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery delays to slow its capacity growth. 
IN THE KNOW: Credit Suisse Cuts Ryanair , Keeps IAG As Top Airline Pick
The company is predicting to take up to 30 737 MAX aircraft deliveries by end of May 2020, less than the 58 
deliveries originally scheduled. The delivery number could either rise, or fall, depending on when 737 MAX returns 
to service, Ryanair said.
As a result, Ryanair expects summer 2020 traffic growth rate to slow to 3% from 7%, which means traffic growth for 
its full financial year to March 2021 will be cut to around 157 million passenger from 162 million.
"We find the quantum of Ryanair's valuation premium increasingly difficult to justify without a stronger revenue self-
help story, with fragile earnings and significant free cash flow generation unlikely. Further, our analysis of LCC 
margin dilution due to aggressive expansion prompts questions over future prospects, without a more selective 
approach to growth beyond MAX delivery delays. This may have significant ramifications for valuation, with unit cost 
deflation more challenging in the future," the pair said. 
Glynn and Truslove said Ryanair needs an "upgraded top line story" to justify its premium rating given margins have 
been re-set below those of British Airways and IAG, with Ryanair trading on more than double the price-to-earnings 
multiple.
Credit Suisse reiterated its Outperform rating on IAG saying the British Airways parent's structural margin gains are 
undervalued.
The bank cut its price target to 713p from 780p. The stock was up 0.2% at 451.90p in London on Tuesday. 
Glynn and Truslove highlighted that IAG's 21% earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation margin 
drives a comparable operating cash flow margin. Moreover, the stock currently trades on a 7% to 9% 2019 to 2020 
free cash flow yield, despite capital expenditure at 1.7 times depreciation and pension obligations.
"We think long haul joint ventures should provide more resilience to pricing than historically, albeit this needs to be 
tested. But IAG stands out amongst the legacy carriers for achieving compelling employee cost efficiency gains to 
boost margins, with employee costs falling from 27% of revenue to 19% at BA over 2007-2018, while on this metric 
Air France and Lufthansa have actually seen no progress," the analysts added.

(Alliance News) - Berenberg reiterated its Buy rating on easyJet saying it expects the budget airline's margin 
outperformance to continue after its encouraging third-quarter update. 
The German bank raised its price target to 1,150 pence from 1,120p. The stock was up 1.7% at 1,095.00p on 
Friday.
easyJet said on Thursday that third quarter revenue rose year-on-year, partly due to the Easter period being in the 
second half of the current financial year. easyJet reported total revenue for the third quarter ended June 30 of 
GBP1.76 billion, an 11% year-on-year rise on 2018's GBP1.51 billion. 
Berenberg said the airline's third-quarter performance "kicks off" the relative margin outperformance that the bank 
expects going forward.
"We see continued evidence of supply restraint by the company and the industry. We expect this to support pricing 
that disproportionately benefits easyJet versus its low-cost peers. Further, easyJet's likely near-term fleet mix shift 
to smaller A320neos may support free cash generation in 2020 (albeit offset by incremental unit costs)," Berenberg 
said. 
The German bank also said larger aircraft will improve easyJet's cost per seat, but its fleet transition is occurring 
slowly. 
Berenberg assumes that several of easyJet's 15 A321neo aircraft due in 2020 will shift to smaller A320neos, due to 
material delivery delays. However, the bank acknowledged free cash flow generation is likely to remain subdued by 
new aircraft deliveries. 
Airbus has faced A320neo-family supply chain issues that have contributed to delays in deliveries to airlines and 
lessors.
IN THE KNOW: Berenberg Pleased By easyJet 's Third Quarter Performance
"Even with delays, however, the company will continue to benefit from unit cost improvements versus older A319 
aircraft. easyJet's A320-family fleet keeps it in an advantageous position, given sustained delays to Boeing 737 
MAX deliveries, as reflected in Ryanair's reduced growth expectations for 2020 announced this week," the bank 
said.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline easyJet PLC said on Thursday that third quarter revenue rose year-on-year, partly 
due to the Easter period being in the second half of the current financial year.
easyJet also announced it has poached the chief operating officer of market rival Ryanair Holdings PLC to take on 
the same role at easyJet. COO Peter Bellew had rejoined Ryanair in late 2017, having been chief executive officer 
of Malaysia Airlines. He previously had been had been director of flight operations for Ryanair until 2014. 
easyJet reported total revenue for the third quarter ended June 30 of GBP1.76 billion, an 11% year-on-year rise on 
2018's GBP1.51 billion. 
The airline said the later Easter in 2019, which generated almost GBP40.0 million extra, and an accounting change, 
which had a revenue benefit of GBP10.0 million, helped drive the third quarter growth. 
easyJet said ancillary revenue, which is the money it generates from baggage charges and on-board catering, grew 
by 14% year-on-year to GBP374.0 million from GBP328.0 million.
Passengers flown in the quarter rose to 26.4 million from 24.4 million a year before, with third-quarter revenue per 
seat also increased year-on-year to GBP61.22 from GBP60.44.
The company said the revenue gain was partially offset by weak market conditions, particularly in Europe due to 
Brexit-related consumer uncertainty. 
easyJet's cost per seat fell year-on-year, by 0.5% to GBP55.16 from GBP55.45. It attributed the reduction to fewer 
costly delays and the wet leasing of fewer aircraft. It also had fewer cancellations in the third quarter this year, 847 
compared with 2,606.
TOP NEWS: easyJet Poaches Ryanair Operating Chief Amid Revenue Rise
Looking ahead, the airline predicted pretax profit for the financial year ending September 30 to be between 
GBP400.0 million and GBP440.0 million, in line with market expectations. It would however be slightly below 
financial 2018's pretax profit of GBP445 million.
Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said: "easyJet's third quarter performance was robust and despite the tougher 
macroeconomic conditions was in line with expectations. Revenue increased by over 11% with revenue per seat 
increasing through a combination of successful revenue initiatives, a solid Easter performance and a focus on late 
yield initiatives, with passenger numbers climbing by two million to over 26 million. 
"Our customers experienced significantly reduced cancellations and long delays largely as a result of our 
investment in operational resilience, which also contributed significantly to driving down cost per seat ex fuel at 
constant currency by 4% in the period." 
easyJet shares were up 3.6% at 1,071.50 pence each in London on Thursday morning. Ryanair was trading flat at 
EUR10.50.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Thursday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Vodafone Group said it has received approval from the European Commission for the acquisition of Liberty Global's 
operations in Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. In May 2018, the FTSE 100 telecommunications 
firm first announced the deal to acquire Liberty Global's operations across Europe for an enterprise value of 
EUR18.4 billion. The acquisition is conditional on the implementation of an agreed remedy package, with the deal 
now expected to be completed by the end of July. The remedy package comprises a cable wholesale agreement 
signed between Vodafone and Telefonica Deutschland in May, allowing the latter to offer broadband services on 
Vodafone's network in Germany. The package also contains a commitment to ensure enough capacity is available 
for over-the-top television distribution.

ASOS reduced its profit expectations for the financial year after warehouses issues affected sales in Europe and 
the US, despite "robust growth" elsewhere. Total revenue for the four months to June, which includes not just retail

The company's total retail sales in the period increased 11% to GBP894.0 million from GBP802.7 million. UK retail 
sales during the four month period jumped 16% to GBP334.1 million from GBP288.0 million and in the Rest of the 
World by 14% to GBP169.5 million from GBP149.2 million. Europe had a sales rise of 5% to GBP269.0 million from 
GBP257.4 million, while the US - though like Europe affected by operational issues - had a 12% rise to GBP121.4 
million from GBP108.1 million. ASOS said the overhaul of its warehouse operations in Berlin and Atlanta which is 
due to be completed by the end of September, hindered sales in the two regions.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Crashing out of the EU without a deal could push the UK's economy into recession and increase borrowing by 
GBP30 billion a year, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned. The OBR quantified the impact on public 
finances of a no-deal, no-transition Brexit scenario and concluded that debt would rise relative to GDP over the next 
three years. But it said the stress test used in the fiscal risks report was "not the most disruptive one we could have 
chosen". The OBR warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to a 2% fall in real GDP by the end of 2020 and a sharp 
fall in the pound. In the executive summary, the OBR said: "Heightened uncertainty and declining confidence deter 
investment, while higher trade barriers with the EU weigh on exports."
----------
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Vodafone Wins EU Approval For Liberty Global Deal
UK retail sales growth accelerated in June, despite a decline in department stores, a report from the Office for 
National Statistics showed. June's retail sales rose 3.8% year-on-year, and increased 1.0% when compared to 
May. Excluding fuel, June's sales rose 3.6% year-on-year and 0.9% month-on-month. By comparison, May's year-
on-year growth was 2.2%. On the year prior, all sectors posted growth save for department stores, and on May non-
food stores provided the biggest contribution to growth. For the three months to June, retail sales rose 0.7%, but 
this was a slowdown from 1.6% growth recorded for the three months to May. 
----------
Boris Johnson will immediately launch a major drive to prepare the country for a no-deal Brexit if he becomes UK 
prime minister. The front-runner for the Tory leadership again refused to rule out suspending Parliament in order to 
force through EU withdrawal without an agreement at the final Tory leadership hustings. Johnson insisted that if he 
becomes PM next week he would ensure the country was ready for the impact of no-deal.
----------
Fears that US President Donald Trump's trade wars will harm the economy are pervasive, but for now, the US 
keeps chugging along with steady job creation and tame inflation, the Federal Reserve reported. Worries about the 
trade outlook are likely to weigh on the Fed's thinking later this month, when it is overwhelmingly expected to cut 
interest rates for the first time in a decade. "Economic activity continued to expand at a modest pace overall from 
mid-May through early July," the Fed said in its regular survey of business conditions across the country. While the 
outlook for the coming months is "generally positive," the survey conducted in advance of the policy meeting found 
"widespread concerns" about possible harm caused by "trade-related uncertainty."
----------
Supporters of Trump shouted "send her back" at a re-election rally on Wednesday after Trump kicked off the event 
by naming the four non-white congresswomen he has been feuding with this week and spelling out his grievances 
against them. The chants erupted at a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, after Trump mentioned Representative 
Ilhan Omar, a Muslim who came to the US as a refugee from Somalia and is now a naturalized US citizen and 
freshman member of Congress. Omar is one of four female Democrats elected last year who he said should "go 
back" to the country they came from, comments he first made Sunday on Twitter that have been widely criticized as 
racist.

(Alliance News) - Pilots at Ryanair Holding PLC are to be balloted on whether to take industrial action in a dispute 
over pay and conditions.
Members of the British Airline Pilots Association will vote in the coming weeks, with the result due in August.
The union said there were a number of areas of concern for pilots on issues such as pensions, maternity benefits, 
allowances and a "fair, transparent and consistent" pay structure.
Balpa general secretary Brian Strutton said: "Our Ryanair representatives have been trying to tackle some of the 
many issues that result from years of non-recognition of unions within Ryanair.
"But we have not been able to make any progress with Ryanair at all on any of our areas of concern."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said it expects Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery delays to slow 
its capacity growth. 
The stock was up 2.0% at EUR10.29 per share in London in early trade, having started slightly lower after the pre-
market announcement.
Ryanair said it remains committed to the B737 MAX aircraft. It expects the troubled jet - grounded globally by 
regulators after two fatal crashes - to return to flying service before the end of 2019, but the exact date of this return 
remains uncertain.
The Irish budget airline is to revise its summer 2020 schedule due to the 737 delivery delays.
The company is predicting to take up to 30 737 MAX aircraft deliveries by end of May 2020, less than the 58 
deliveries originally scheduled. The delivery number could either rise, or fall, depending on when 737 MAX returns 
to service, Ryanair said. 
As a result, Ryanair expects summer 2020 traffic growth rate to slow to 3% from 7%, which means traffic growth for 
its full financial year to March 2021 will be cut to around 157 million passenger from 162 million.
"This shortfall in aircraft deliveries will necessitate some base cuts and closures for summer 2020, but also for the 
winter 2019 schedule. We are starting a series of discussions with our airports to determine which of Ryanair's 
underperforming or loss making bases should suffer these short term cuts and/or closures from November 2019. 
We will also be consulting with our people and our unions in planning and implementing these base cuts and 
closures, which are directly caused by the B737 MAX delivery delays to the B737 MAX program," said Chief 
Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.

"Ryanair will continue to work with Boeing and [European Union Aviation Safety Agency] to recover these delivery 
delays during the winter of 2020, so that we can restore our growth to normal levels in summer 2021," O'Leary 
added.

Top US and Chinese trade negotiators are due to speak by telephone in the coming days, but no face-to-face talks 
have been scheduled yet, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. That would be the second call in two weeks 
by senior officials from Washington and Beijing as the thaw in fraught trade negotiations continues. "We expect to 
have another principal-level call this week," Mnuchin told reporters on Monday. "To the extent we make significant 
progress, there's a good chance we'll go there later."
----------
Mnuchin also said he does not expect there to be a government shutdown this year and that politicians will agree to 
raise the debt ceiling on time. Mnuchin said he was engaged in "productive discussions" with Nancy Pelosi, the 
Democratic party leader and Speaker of the House, and that both major parties were keen to reach an agreement. 
Treasury has said the federal government could run out of money by the first week of September and therefore it 
was crucial that lawmakers raise the limit before they head into their summer recess this month.

Veteran German politician Ursula von der Leyen is to face a nail-biting vote in Strasbourg Tuesday evening as 
European lawmakers decide whether to back her bid for one of the most powerful EU positions: the presidency of 
the European Commission. The outcome of the European Parliament vote looks far from certain but, if the 
conservative politician can muster an absolute majority of 374 votes out of 747, she will take over the most powerful 
portfolio of her career. Standing between her and the leadership of the EU's executive are parliament's 
environmentalist Green and hard-left factions. They have already vowed not to back her with their combined 115 
votes.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned the US is "playing with fire", echoing remarks by President

the US is playing with fire," Zarif told NBC News. Iran announced last week that it had enriched uranium past the 
3.67% limit set by the nuclear deal, and has also surpassed the 300-kilogram cap on enriched uranium reserves. 
But "it can be reversed within hours," Zarif told the channel, adding: "We are not about to develop nuclear weapons. 
Had we wanted to develop nuclear weapons, we would have been able to do it [a] long time ago."

Burberry Group said it saw a good start to its financial year as Chief Creative Officer Riccardo Tisci continues to 
make his mark on the fashion house. The company said it saw an excellent consumer response to Tisci's work with 
new collections delivering strong double-digit percentage growth compared to last year's collections, in line with 
expectations. For the 13 weeks to June 29, the company reported retail revenue of GBP498 million, up 4% from 
GBP479 million in the first quarter last year. Comparable store sales were up 4%, with growth led by new products. 
In the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region comparable store sales grew by a low-single digit percentage, 
supported by tourist spending, which particularly benefited the UK. In the key Asia Pacific region, comparable store 
sales grew by a high single-digit percentage driven by Mainland China, up by the mid-teens. The Americas unit was 
flat, with the US growing by a low-single digit percentage but Canada was hurt by a later markdown period. 
Burberry maintained its financial 2020 guidance for broadly stable revenue and adjusted operating margin at 
constant exchange rates including cumulative cost savings of GBP120 million.
----------
Experian said it started its financial year well and in line with expectations and left its guidance unchanged. For the 
three months to June 30, the company reported total revenue growth of 7% at constant exchange rates and organic 
revenue growth of 6%. At actual exchange rates total growth was 4%. In the North America region, organic revenue 
increased by 8%. Total revenue growth was 9%, which the company said reflected the contribution from its recent 
acquisition of AllClear ID. In the UK and Ireland, total and organic revenue growth were both flat at constant 
currency. At constant currency, total revenue growth across EMEA/Asia Pacific region was 6%, while organic 
revenue declined by 1%.

Rio Tinto reported a drop in first half iron ore production at the company's Pilbara operations in Western Australia 
due to operational and weather-related issues. In the six months to June 30, Rio Tinto's Pilbara iron ore production, 
on a 100% basis, slipped 8% year-on-year to 155.7 million tonnes. Iron shipments also decreased 8% to 154.6 
million tonnes. Pilbara iron production in the second quarter was down 7% to 79.7 million tonnes. Iron ore 
shipments in the three month period was 3% lower at 85.4 million tonnes. Rio Tinto blamed the fall in shipments on 
recovery works following Tropical Cyclone Veronica and a fire at Cape Lambert. The miner said all repairs are now 
complete.
----------
Mining firm Anglo American Platinum said it expects interim profit to more than double on the year prior amid higher 
platinum prices and stock adjustment gains. For the six months ended June, Anglo American Platinum anticipates 
its basic earnings per share to be between ZAR26.90 and ZAR28.54. This is over three times higher than the 
ZAR8.31 earnings per share reported the year prior. Anglo American Platinum explained the jump in profit 
performance was due to a higher platinum group metal basket price in rand, as well as a ZAR1.0 billion stock count 
adjustment gain in the most recent six month period. In contrast, stock count adjustments served as a ZAR500 
million headwind a year prior.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening marginally lower on Tuesday, amid mixed trading in 
Asian equity markets, as investors look to a busy day on the US earnings front. 
In early company news, Irish airline Ryanair said it would scale back some of its services amid delays to deliveries 
of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, while fashion retailer Burberry and credit checking firm Experian said 
they made positive starts to their respective financial years.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 4.72 points lower at 7,527.00. The blue chip index closed 25.75 
points higher, or 0.3%, at 7,531.72 on Monday. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed down 0.7%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is down 0.3%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.2%. Financial markets in Japan reopened Tuesday after being closed on 
Monday for a public holiday. 
Budget carrier Ryanair Holdings said it expects Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery delays to slow capacity growth.
Ryanair said it remains committed to the B737 MAX aircraft. It expects the jet - grounded globally by regulators after 
two fatal crashes - to return to flying service before the end of 2019, but the exact date of this return remains 
uncertain.
The airline is to revise its summer 2020 schedule due to the 737 delivery delays.
As a result, Ryanair said it expects summer 2020 traffic growth rate to slow to 3% from 7%, which means traffic 
growth for its full financial year to March 2021 will be cut to around 157 million passenger from 162 million.

"This shortfall in aircraft deliveries will necessitate some base cuts and closures for summer 2020, but also for the 
winter 2019 schedule. We are starting a series of discussions with our airports to determine which of Ryanair's 
underperforming or loss making bases should suffer these short term cuts and/or closures from November 2019. 
We will also be consulting with our people and our unions in planning and implementing these base cuts and 
closures, which are directly caused by the B737 MAX delivery delays to the B737 MAX program," said Chief 
Executive Officer Michael O'Leary.
Burberry Group said it saw a good start to its financial year as Chief Creative Officer Riccardo Tisci continues to 
make his mark on the fashion house. 
The company said it saw an excellent consumer response to Tisci's work with new collections delivering strong 
double-digit percentage growth compared to last year's collections, in line with expectations.

organic revenue growth of 6%. At actual exchange rates total growth was 4%. 
In the North America region, organic revenue increased by 8%. Total revenue growth was 9%, which the company 
said reflected the contribution from its recent acquisition of AllClear ID.
In the UK and Ireland, total and organic revenue growth were both flat at constant currency. At constant currency, 
total revenue growth across EMEA/Asia Pacific region was 6%, while organic revenue declined by 1%.
Rio Tinto reported a drop in first half iron ore production at the company's Pilbara operations in Western Australia

Pilbara iron production in the second quarter was down 7% to 79.7 million tonnes. Iron ore shipments in the three 
month period was 3% lower at 85.4 million tonnes.
Rio Tinto blamed the fall in shipments due to recovery works following Tropical Cyclone Veronica and a fire at Cape 
Lambert. The miner said all repairs are now complete.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2513 early Tuesday, flat against USD1.2518 at the London equities close Monday.

The economic calendar on Tuesday has UK claimant count and average earnings at 0930 BST, eurozone trade 
balance at 1000 BST and US retail sales and US import and export price indexes at 1330 BST. The US Johnson 
Redbook Retail Sales Index follows at 1355 BST. 
Top US and Chinese trade negotiators are due to speak by telephone in the coming days, but no face-to-face talks

make significant progress, there's a good chance we'll go there later."
President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart last month agreed to resume trade talks after discussions 
collapsed in early May when the American side accused Beijing of reneging on key commitments.
As a result, Trump raised duty rates on USD200 billion in Chinese imports but agreed last month not to move 
forward with another USD300 billion in import duties.
In the US earnings calendar on Tuesday, banks JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo will report 
earnings on Tuesday before the New York opening bell. Consumer products firm Johnson & Johnson also will issue 
second quarter earnings.

(Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Tuesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings said it expects Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery delays to slow its capacity growth. Ryanair said it 
remains committed to the B737 MAX aircraft. It expects the troubled jet - grounded globally by regulators after two 
fatal crashes - to return to flying service before the end of 2019, but the exact date of this return remains uncertain. 
The Irish budget airline is to revise its summer 2020 schedule due to the 737 delivery delays. The company is 
predicting to take up to 30 737 MAX aircraft deliveries by end of May 2020, less than the 58 deliveries originally 
scheduled. The delivery number could either rise, or fall, depending on when 737 MAX returns to service, Ryanair 
said. As a result, Ryanair expects summer 2020 traffic growth rate to slow to 3% from 7%, which means traffic 
growth for its full financial year to March 2021 will be cut to around 157 million passenger from 162 million.
----------
Burberry Group reported a strong first quarter performance, amid a successful launch of new products and growth 
in Asia. For the 13 weeks ended June 29, reported retail revenue grew 4.0% to GBP498 million from GBP479 
million the year prior. At constant currency rates, retail revenue grew 2%. On a comparable store basis, sales grew 
4% on the year prior driven by new products. Burberry said that the proportion of its main offer within stores being 
from new products was 50% in June, up from between 10% and 15% in March. As new product continues to build 
throughout the year, Burberry expects comparable store sales to accelerate. For the full year ending March 2020, 
Burberry maintained current forecasts. The FTSE 100-listed firm expects revenue and adjusted operating margins 
to remain broadly stable on the year prior. 
----------
Experian said it has started the year "well", with revenue growth driven by North America. In the three months to 
June 30, Experian saw total revenue growth of 4% compared to the year before. This was entirely driven by a 9% 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: UK Unemployment Rate Remains At 45-Year Low
growth in the company's North American operations. Every other region in which Experian operates - Latin 
America, UK & Ireland and EMEA/Asia Pacific - saw total revenue slip. At constant exchange rates, Experian saw 
total organic revenue growth of 6%. In North America, organic revenue growth was 8%, with 9% growth in Latin 
America. UK & Ireland's organic revenue was flat on the year before with EMEA/Asia Pacific slipping 1%. In North 
America, the organic revenue growth was driven by both of the company's main operating units - B2B and 
Consumer Services - seeing growth of 8% and 9%, respectively. In Latin America, the organic growth was driven by 
the B2B unit, rising 9% in the quarter.
----------
Rio Tinto said its Oyu Tolgoi underground project in Mongolia could be delayed by 16 to 30 months. The miner said 
enhanced geotechnical information and data modelling has identified "some stability risks" with the approved mine 
design. Rio Tinto is now considering "a number" of other mine designs to complete the project. Once completed, 
Rio Tinto said Oyu Tolgoi will be one of the largest copper mines in the world. Depending on which mine design is 
chosen, first sustainable production from the mine is expected between May 2022 and June 2023 - which 
represents a potential 16 to 30 month delay compared to the original guidance. Rio Tinto now expects the project 
development capital spend to come in at between USD6.5 billion to USD7.2 billion - which represents an increase 
of between USD1.2 billion and USD1.9 billion from the original guidance of USD5.3 billion. Late Monday, the miner 
reported a drop in first half iron ore production at the company's Pilbara operations in Western Australia due to 
operational and weather-related issues. 
----------
AG Barr said weak trading during the first half of the year saw revenue sink 10%, and warned that full-year profit 
could be as much as a fifth lower. For the 26 weeks ending July 27, revenue is forecast by the company to fall 10% 
to GBP123 million from GBP136.9 million reported the year prior. AG Barr reported trading during the period had 
been "below our expectations" amid a number of market and brand-specific headwinds. In particular, AG Barr said 
2018 had been a year of "unprecedented" challenges for the industry through a combination of a new soft drink 
levy, carbon dioxide shortages, and a hot summer. At the time, AG Barr had focused on building volume over the 
short-term before returning emphasis on increasing prices in March 2019. AG Barr had expected this change to hurt 
volumes. Nonetheless, a combination of "disappointing" spring and early summer weather and brand-related issues 
at Rockstar energy and Rubicon juice drinks sapped trading performance. The firm said the impact of the weather 
on results was being compounded as it approaches the half-year stage, when the hot weather was at its peak in 
2018.
----------
The UK monopoly regulator opened a probe into the buyout of satellite firm Inmarsat by a consortium led by private 
equity Apax Partners. Inmarsat in March agreed a USD3.4 billion, or 546 pence per share, acquisition offer from a 
consortium including Apax Partners, Warburg Pincus International, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, and 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The Competition & Markets Authority said it is considering whether the 
deal will result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or 
services. The regulator has invited comments on the transaction from any interested party by July 27. Inmarsat in 
May said it slipped to a first-quarter loss on exceptional charges, but said it was confident in its future prospects

Office for National Statistics showed. The unemployment rate was 3.8%, in line with the month before and lowest 
level since 1974. Estimated employment rate for three month period stood at 76.0%, higher than 75.6% a year 
earlier. Including bonuses, average weekly earnings in the UK rose 3.4% year-on-year in the three months to May, 
higher than the revised 3.2% growth for the three months to April, and 3.1% market forecast, as cited by FXStreet. 
Excluding bonuses, earnings were up 3.6%, above FXStreet's consensus estimate of 3.5% and April's figure of 
3.4%.

(Alliance News) - Vinci SA on Friday reported high-single-digit growth in passenger numbers across its airport 
network, helped by the development of new routes.
The French infrastructure company said passenger numbers across its Airports division increased by 7.3% in the 
three months to the end of June to 66.2 million compared to the same period in 2018. Over the first half of 2019, 
traffic grew by 6.7%.
Vinci said the growth reflects the opening of new airline links, often for the first time, between its airports facilities 
and world capitals. The company's Airports unit has 46 airports in the network. 
Geographically, in Portugal, passenger numbers rose 7.8% in the second quarter across the 10 facilities operated 
by Vinci Airports. The growth was boosted by Qatar Airways, which opened the first direct link between Lisbon and 
Doha in June, and TAP Air Portugal, which introduced its first service to Washington DC.
In France, Clermont-Ferrand Airport saw passenger number increasing by 3.4% year-on-year after introduction of a 
new, regular service to Lisbon operated by Ryanair Holdings PLC.
In the UK, passenger numbers at London Gatwick airport, which was added the VINCI Airports business in May, 
rose 1.7% in the second quarter to 12.5 million. Belfast Airport saw its traffic increase by 5.6% over the same 
period.
"The development of new routes is central to the value creation project of Vinci Airports, which has adopted a 
proactive approach in partnership with airlines," said Nicolas Notebaert, president of Vinci Airports. 
He added: "By facilitating tourist, commercial and cultural exchanges, each new link helps to promote the host 
country and boost its economic growth."

(Alliance News) - JPMorgan reiterated its Neutral rating on Ryanair Holdings taking a cautious view on the Irish 
carrier due to a weaker fares outlook in 2020.
The US bank trimmed its price target to EUR10.50 from EUR11. Ryanair shares were down 0.6% at EUR10.22 in 
London on Wednesday. 
JPMorgan trimmed its financial 2020 to 2022 earnings per share estimate by 3% to 4%, taking a more prudent view 
on the outlook for fares in 2020.
JPMorgan's David Perry said Ryanair will have to face challenging conditions in two markets in 2020: Germany and 
the UK.
The analyst highlighted that in Germany the collapse of carrier Air Berlin in 2017 has led to an ongoing market 
share battle between Ryanair, budget airline easyJet and German flagship Lufthansa, which was a major reason for 
Lufthansa's profit warning on June.
Additionally, consumers in the UK have been cautious in the run up to Brexit and Ryanair has admitted that price 
stimulation is needed to achieve its growth targets.
"We now assume Ryanair's average revenue per passenger (including ancillaries) grows 2.6% in fiscal 2020, vs 3% 
previously assumed. For fiscal 2021 and 2022 we mark-to-market for the increase in fuel prices, but assume 
Ryanair can offset this with slightly higher fares," Perry said. 
Perry also said further delays to the Boeing 737 MAX orders could hurt Ryanair's 2021 growth. The airline still 
hopes to receive 47 Boeing 737 MAX planes between October 2019 and March 2020. 
"If the aircraft arrive towards the end of this period, there would be no impact on Ryanair's growth plans in March 
2020 as it can use older aircraft that it normally stands down for the winter. If the MAX aircraft don't arrive by end

March 2020, then Ryanair probably won't be able to achieve the growth it plans in the summer season of fiscal 
2021. For now, we are not changing our growth forecasts for fiscal 2021 but we flag this as a potential risk," the 
analyst added.

reported an increase in passenger numbers and load factors for June.

Group load factor - the percentage of seats it fills - was 97% in June, up from 96% a year before.

(Alliance News) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday said it has amended the terms of its share 
buyback programme in order to limit the number of non-EU shareholders in the company. 
In the airline's financial 2019 results, released in May, Ryanair announced it was embarking on a EUR700 million 
share buyback, that will run for roughly the next 9 to 12 months. 
Prior to that, back in March, Ryanair had decided that all shares held by non-EU shareholders, including British 
ones after Brexit, will be treated as "restricted shares", meaning that they will have no entitlement to attend, speak 
or vote at any company meeting.  
The resolutions put in place in March were to ensure Ryanair remained majority-controlled by EU shareholders. The 
airline said the restrictions will remain in place until the company "determines that the ownership and control of the 
company is no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licences held by the company".
Ryanair said the amendments announced on Wednesday "should" reduce the time these resolutions need to be in 
place.
On Wednesday, the airline said it will allow shares to be repurchased by way of block trades from EU shareholders 
as part of its buyback programme, which currently includes British shareholders. 
Block trades carried out with UK shareholders will limit the proportionate number of shares held by non-EU 
shareholders in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Ryanair said the maximum to be spent by the company in the programme will remain unchanged at EUR700 
million.
Shares in Ryanair were 0.5% higher in London on Wednesday at EUR9.98 each.

(Alliance News) - HSBC cut both International Consolidated Airlines and easyJet to Reduce from Hold, believing 
European airlines will follow Lufthansa's profit warning.
Shares in IAG were down 2.6% at 445.60 pence on Wednesday, while easyJet was 1.9% lower at 883.60p. 
Wizz Air was down 1.2% at 3,497p and Ryanair down 1.4% at EUR9.862.
On Monday, German flag carrier Lufthansa said it now expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of 
EUR2.0 billion to EUR2.4 billion in 2019, on the basis of low-single-digit revenue growth. In 2018, Lufthansa 
reported adjusted Ebit of EUR2.8 billion, down from EUR3.0 billion in 2017.
Lufthansa blamed "price deterioration in Europe caused by market-wide overcapacities and aggressively growing 
low cost competitors are putting pressure on yields in the European short-haul market".
HSBC said it thinks the problem is not excessive supply, but "rapidly weakening demand". 
"We think this is primarily driven by consumer confidence, with environmental sensitivities and the memory of last 
year's hot summer playing supporting roles," the bank said.
Accordingly, HSBC expects many European airline's to follow Lufthansa's lead. 
"We think that the strength of demand has dropped remarkably: airlines are able to fill their aircraft, but only by 
discounting," HSBC observed. In addition, HSBC said it does not expect strong corporate travel to be sustained in 
the face of global trade tensions. 
"As a result of our cautious stance, we downgrade our ratings for four carriers, lowering Air France-KLM and Finnair 
to Hold from Buy, and easyJet and IAG to Reduce from Hold," said HSBC, retaining its Hold rating on Wizz and 
Reduce recommendation on Ryanair. 
IN THE KNOW: HSBC Sees Further Airline Profit Warnings After Lufthansa
On easyJet, HSBC said it admires the long-term equity story, but believes the low-cost airline faces "very 
challenging revenue conditions" in its largest UK market, as well as in its new Berlin base. 
"We foresee a further profit warning from easyJet, so lower our estimates and target price, and downgrade to 
Reduce from Hold," said HSBC, cutting its price target to 800p from 1,100p.
On IAG, the bank said it has "long standing concerns", cautious over leisure revenue from the US and corporate 
travel strength, as well as its exposure to future competition on the North Atlantic.
HSBC lowered IAG's price target to 400p from 550p.

(Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened higher on Monday, with airlines weighing on the FTSE 100 after a 
profit warning by Germany's Lufthansa, while in the FTSE 250, Kier Group's woes continued as the construction 
firm axed its dividend. 
The FTSE 100 was up just 2.10 points at 7,347.88. The FTSE 250 was up 37.51 points, or 0.2%, at 19,155.85. The 
AIM All-Share was up 1.98 points, or 0.2%, at 939.19.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 0.1% at 12,470.39. The Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 17,158.89, and the Cboe UK 
Small Companies was flat at 11,670.12.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris was flat and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was up 0.1%.
In the FTSE 100, Severn Trent was up 1.0% after Macquarie started coverage on the water company with an 
Outperform rating. 
The Australian bank initiated fellow utility stocks National Grid and United Utilities at Outperform. National Grid and 
United Utilities were up 0.4% and 0.3% respectively. 
At the other end of the large cap index, airlines were the worst performers after German carrier Lufthansa lowered 
its profit outlook for 2019, amid market over capacity and intense competition from low-cost carriers in Europe.
Budget airline easyJet and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group were down 3.3% and 
3.1%, respectively. Midcap peer Wizz Air was down 4.6% and Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was down 4.2%. 
Lufthansa blamed "price deterioration in Europe caused by market-wide overcapacities and aggressively growing 
low cost competitors are putting pressure on yields in the European short-haul market".
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Airlines Fall After Lufthansa 's Profit Warning
The German airline said it now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax of EUR2.0 billion to EUR2.4 billion 
in 2019, on the basis of low-single-digit revenue growth. In 2018, Lufthansa reported adjusted Ebit of EUR2.8 
billion, down from EUR3.0 billion in 2017.
It said its network airlines are expected to have an adjusted Ebit margin of between 7% and 9%, with budget carrier 
Eurowings suffering an adjusted Ebit margin of negative 4% to negative 6%.
British American Tobacco was down 1.6% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarette 
maker to Underweight from Equal Weight. 
In the FTSE 250, Babcock International was up 3.7% after the defence contractor confirmed it rejected in January 
an approach from outsourcer Serco Group.
The proposal was unsolicited and "highly preliminary", Babcock said, and involved an all-share merger. No further 
proposal has been received since January. The Sunday Times had reported Serco made at least two attempts to 
merge with Babcock. 
Serco shares were flat. 
At the bottom of the midcap index, Kier Group was down 6.6%. The troubled construction firm suspended dividend 
payments and earmarked several non-core business for disposal as it looks to get its balance sheet under control.
Kier has put up for sale Kier Living, its housebuilding business, saying that despite being a strong business it would 
require significant funding to keep growing. So far there have been "a number" of expressions of interest.
Kier Property also has been put up for sale, with the investment required likewise "incompatible" with Kier's capital 
requirements, and Kier also will be quitting the Management and Environmental Services businesses.
Kier has suspended dividend payments for its year ending June, and the following financial year. At the interim 
stage, Kier slashed its first half dividend 79% to 4.9 pence a share. 
The stock is down 71% so far in 2019. Kier will be demoted from the FTSE 250 when the FTSE Russell index 
review changes come into effect next Monday. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed flat. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.2%, while the Hang 
Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2577 Monday, down from USD1.2604 at the London equities close Friday.
The British Chamber of Commerce cut its UK growth forecasts for the next two years, it revealed Monday, despite a 
more positive outlook on 2019.
For 2020, the BCC has cut its growth forecast to 1.0% from 1.3%, and for 2021 to 1.2% from 1.4%. But for 2019, 
the BCC has upgraded its UK growth estimate to 1.3% from 1.2%, mainly due to "exceptionally rapid" stockbuilding 
early in 2019, as manufacturers prepared for the intended end-March Brexit.
"However, the immediate boost to UK GDP is forecast to come at the cost of more subdued growth in 2020 and 
2021 as the unwinding of historically-high inventory levels, coupled with weaker business investment, weigh on 
economic activity," said the BCC.
The economic events calendar has Ireland first-quarter GDP data at 1100 BST.

(Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices on Monday.

----------
Royal Bank of Scotland, up 2.2%. The state-backed lender said the completion of the merger between two Saudi 
Arabia based banks - Alawwal bank and Saudi British Bank - will lead to a "positive and material financial impact". 
RBS, through its Dutch-domiciled investment bank NatWest Markets, was part of a consortium including Stichting 
Administratiekantoor Beheer Financiele Instellingen and Spain's Banco Santander that held an aggregate 40% 
equity stake in Alawwal bank. 
The interest of RBS was equivalent to a 15.3% shareholding in Alawwal bank. RBS said as a result of the merger 
completion on Sunday, the NatWest Markets unit would recognise an income gain on the disposal of the Alawwal 
bank stake for shares in Saudi British Bank of GBP400 million and a reduction in risk weighted assets of GBP4.7 
billion. RBS will also remove legacy liabilities of GBP300 million due to the merger. In total, RBS will record a 
GBP700 million profit attributable to shareholders as a result of the Saudi bank combination. It also anticipates the 
merger to increase its CET1 core capital ratio at March 31 by 60 basis points, being 20 points attributable profit and 
40 points to reduction in risk weighted assets.

easyJet, down 4.5%, International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 3.6%. The airlines were lower following a

4.9 pence a share. "New CEO Andrew Davies is not stopping at just the dividend. He is taking drastic action in an 
attempt to avoid Kier suffering a similar fate to its doomed peer Carillion. Jobs are being slashed, the housebuilding 
unit is being sold and the company is prioritising cash flow. These all seem like sensible steps but delivering on this 
plan will not be easy," said AJ Bell's Russ Mould.

OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Union Jack Oil, up 26%, Reabold Resources, up 21%. The oil and gas firms announced potentially the biggest 
onshore find in the UK since 1973. The gas discovery has been made on the West Newton A-2 well in Humberside 
in the north-east of England, an area with "an abundance" of production infrastructure, Reabold said. Reabold owns 
24% of the PEDL183 licence on which the well is situated, with Union Jack owning just shy of 17%. The licence is 
operated by Rathlin Energy UK. The well was drilled to a depth of 2,061 metres, finding a net 65-metre hydrocarbon 
interval within the Kirkham Abbey formation, which indicates a "substantial" accumulation, Reabold said. Overall, 
the field could include "at least" 189 billion cubic feet of gas, equivalent to around 31.3 million barrels of oil. Drilling 
is finished, and planning has already been received for testing of the well. This will start in the third quarter of the 
year, Reabold added.

OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - LOSERS
----------
WINNERS & LOSERS SUMMARY: Kier Sinks After Suspending Dividend
Staffline Group, down 30%. The recruiter said it would scrap its dividend and announced plans for a GBP30 million 
share placing, in a bid to reduce debt. Staffline is planning a GBP30 million share placing in order to cut its ratio of 
net debt to underlying earnings before interest, depreciation, taxation, and amortisation to below two times. If an 
equity capital raise goes ahead, Staffline also expects to launch a GBP7 million open offer "to enable wider 
shareholder participation". Staffline said it will not be recommending a final dividend for 2018 but did reiterate its 
guidance for an underlying 2018 performance "in line with expectations". Moreover, the company expects its 
underlying earnings before interest and taxation in 2019 to be somewhere between GBP23 million and GBP28 
million. Net debt at the end of 2019, before proceeds of any equity capital raise, is due "to be in line with current 
market expectations". In May, Staffline had warned that it was facing headwinds in its training and recruitment 
divisions. On Monday, Staffline said it may require a waiver of possible future breaches to the leverage covenant in 
its lending agreements.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Wednesday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
BT Group said it will close around 270 offices as it looks to consolidate its operations into just 30 locations across 
the country. The FTSE 100-listed telecommunications firm was making the move as part of its "Better Workplace" 
programme announced in May 2018. Ultimately, this will see the former state-owned monopoly consolidate its more 
than 300 current locations to just around 30. The programme is part of a broader plan to cut as many as 13,000 
back office and middle management jobs and a three-year cost reduction of GBP1.5 billion. These consolidated 
sites will contain "modern, future-fit buildings, including corporate offices, contact centres and specialist sites", the 
firm explained. The process is expected to be completed by 2023. 
----------
Provident Financial said the collapse of Non-Standard Finance's hostile GBP1.1 billion takeover for the company 
was "in the best interest of shareholders". Responding to a statement from lender NSF, stating that it would "lapse" 
the offer after discussions with the UK regulators, Provident said it "greatly regrets the unnecessary distraction, cost 
and impact of the uncertainty" caused by the bid. NFS's bid for its bigger London-listed home credit rival collapsed 
after the UK financial regulator blocked the deal on Tuesday. NSF said it would "lapse" the offer following 
discussions with the regulatory authorities as it had received a low level of acceptances by Wednesday's deadline 
to declare the offer bid wholly unconditional. As at Wednesday, NFS had received acceptances from around 54% of 
Provident investors. 
----------
Aviva said Chief Financial Officer Tom Stoddard will step down from his role and from the FTSE 100 insurer's board 
from the end of June. Stoddard - CFO since 2014 - will be replaced by Aviva UK Insurance CFO Jason Windsor on 
an interim basis, with Stoddard remaining at Aviva until the end of 2019 in order to "support an orderly transition." 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: BT To Close Offices In Over 270 UK Locations
Windsor has been at Aviva since 2010 and has "extensive" experience of the firm after serving in a number of 
different senior roles. 
----------
Ryanair Holdings said its traffic rose 13% in May as the company carried 14.1 million passengers in the month. In 
the same month of 2018, the Irish budget airline transported 12.5 million passengers. Excluding the contribution of 
Austrian airline Lauda, which Ryanair acquired in December, the airline's traffic was up 8% to 13.5 million 
customers. On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair's traffic was up 10% in May to 144.9 million passengers from 132.1 
million a year prior. In May, Ryanair operated almost 78,000 scheduled flights. 
----------
Workspace Group said it delivered "impressive" growth in its most recently ended financial year, on the back of 
which it increased its dividend. The office space provider said its pretax profit declined by 19% in the year to the 
end of March to GBP137.3 million from GBP170.4 million reported a year ago, due to reduced income from 
disposals and lower uplift in property valuation. Trading profit, however, rose by 19% to GBP72.4 million from 
GBP60.7 million year-on-year. The trading profit is net rental income, less administrative expenses and net finance 
costs. The company declared a final dividend of 22.26 pence a share, taking the total payout for the year to 32.87p, 
up 20% from 27.39p paid the year before. 
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were higher following a strong close in the US overnight after dovish comments from the Federal 
Reserve. In the FTSE 250, Provident was the best performer, up 17%. The pound was up against the dollar 
following positive UK services PMI data. Wall Street was pointed to a higher open. 
----------
FTSE 100: up 0.5% at 7,252.08
FTSE 250: up 0.8% at 19,162.71
AIM ALL-SHARE: up 0.3% at 945.07

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Amid growing concerns escalating global trade tensions could spark a recession, US Federal Reserve Chairman 
Jerome Powell has pledged the central bank will take appropriate actions to sustain the US, economic expansion. 
Powell mentioned recent developments involving trade negotiations and other matters in opening remarks at a 
Chicago Fed conference on Tuesday, acknowledging that the Fed does not know how or when these issues will be 
resolved. "We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the US economic outlook and, as 
always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our 
symmetric 2% objective," Powell said. The rest of Powell's speech focused on longer-run issues, but the Fed chief's 
initial comments generated optimism about a potential interest rate cut and spurred a rally on Wall Street. Powell's 
comments come after St Louis Fed President James Bullard suggested in a speech on Monday that an interest rate 
cut "may be warranted soon" due in part to escalating global trade tensions.
----------
The World Bank downgraded its global growth outlook, citing subdued investment and risks from escalating trade 
tensions. Global growth is forecast to slow to 2.6% this year, reflecting weaker-than-expected trade and investment, 
the bank said in its semi-annual report. The 2019 growth outlook was revised down from 2.9%. Annual economic 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: BT To Close Offices In Over 270 UK Locations
growth is projected to gradually rise back to 2.8% by 2021, predicated on continued benign global financing 
conditions and a modest recovery in emerging market and developing economies.

Activity in the dominant UK services sector accelerated sharply in the month of May, the latest survey report from 
IHS Markit showed. IHS Markit/CIPS UK services purchasing managers' index rose to 51.0 in May from 50.4 in 
April. This comfortably beat the consensus estimate of 50.6, as compiled by FXStreet. Any reading above 50.0 
indicates expansion in the sector.
----------
Eurozone private sector growth remained sluggish in May, despite an improvement on the earlier flash reading 
sending the pace to a three month high as the service sector expanded at a "solid" rate. Data from IHS Markit 
released on Wednesday showed the eurozone composite purchasing managers' index edged up to 51.8 points in 
May from 51.5 points in April. The final May print also represented an improvement on the flash reading of 51.6 
points. IHS Markit explained the growth in May was driven by the services sector. The eurozone services PMI in 
May read 52.9 points, up from 52.8 in April, and ahead of the 52.5 points flash estimate for May. 
----------
The Irish unemployment rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 4.4% in May from 4.6% in April and 5.9% in May 2018, 
according a report by the Central Statistics Office. Industrial production rose 3.5% in April from March and was up 
7.1% on a year before, the CSO said.
----------
China registered a "modest" expansion in business during May, Caixin showed, but growth has slowed. The 
Chinese Services Business Activity Index fell to 52.7 in May, a three-month low, from 54.5 in April. A figure over 50 
means expansion. This shows that services sector activity did expand in May, but the rate eased somewhat from 
April. The slower growth in the services sector pushed down the composite output index for May to 51.5 from 52.7 
in April, also a three-month low. 
----------
Financial regulators in the UK and the Netherlands signed a new closer partnership as Brexit raised additional 
cooperation and oversight needs for the two countries. The UK Financial Conduct Authority said it had signed the 
agreement to formalise the closer partnership with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets in order to "protect 
and enhance the integrity and stability of both countries financial systems." The FCA explained that since the UK 
voted to leave the European Union in 2016 - a process which is still being finalised - "several" financial institutions 
operating in both the UK and Netherlands have applied for a licence to operate in both countries.

LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Non-Standard Finance Deal For Provident Off
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Non-Standard Finance Deal For Provident Off

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are set to open higher on Wednesday, following onfrom sharp 
gains seen on Wall Street after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested the US central bank could lower 
interest rates.
In London, Non-Standard Finance's hostile takeover of larger doorstep lending rival Provident Financial lapsed. 
FTSE 100-listed Aviva's chief financial officer has decided to step down, while Workspace reported a sharp rise in 
rental income. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 is set to open 7.01 points higher at 7,221.30. The blue chip index closed up 29.49 
points, or 0.4%, at 7,214.29 on Tuesday.
Non-Standard Finance's hostile GBP1.1 billion takeover for Provident Financial collapsed after the UK financial 
regulator blocked the deal on Tuesday.
Non-Standard Finance said it would "lapse" the offer following discussions with regulatory authorities as it had 
received a low level of acceptances by Wednesday deadline to declare the offer bid wholly unconditional. As at 
Wednesday, Non-Standard Finance had received acceptances from around 54% of Provident investors. 
Non-Standard Finance explained that while it remains appropriately capitalised, due to the low level of acceptances 
received, "the enlarged Non-Standard Finance group would not have sufficient regulatory capital on a consolidated 
basis at completion due to the expected level of minority interests at that point".
John van Kuffeler, Non-Standard Finance's group chief executive said: "I am very disappointed that despite our 
best efforts customers, employees and shareholders will not now benefit from our transformation plan to build a 
brighter future by combining Provident with Non-Standard Finance."
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Non-Standard Finance Deal For Provident Off
Aviva said CFO Tom Stoddard will be stepping down at the end of June. Aviva said Stoddard will remain with the 
company until the end of 2019 to "support an orderly transition". 
Current Aviva UK Insurance CFO Jason Windsor has been appointed interim CFO for the group.
Ryanair said its May traffic was up 13% year-on-year to 14.1 million customers. The budget airline operated 78,000 
scheduled flights in May. 
Office space rental firm Workspace saw a sharp fall in pretax profit in financial 2019 due to a lower year-on-year 
valuation increase and lower disposals profits compared to the year before. 
In the twelve months to March 31, Workspace reported pretax profit of GBP137.3 million, down from GBP170.4 
million. The company's trading profit increased 19%, however, to GBP72.4 million.
Workspace hiked its full year dividend 20% to 32.87 pence.
Card Factory said its first-quarter total sales were up 6.4% on a year before, with like-for-like sales in the three 
months to April 30 up 2.3%.
Card Factory said its performance in the first quarter "represents an encouraging start to the year". The company's 
expectations for the full year remain unchanged.
Go-Ahead said it has appointed Elodie Brian as chief financial officer on a permanent basis. Brian has been the 
firm's interim CFO since December. 
Speaking at the motoring association's AGM, AA said its trading in the period is in line with expectations and 
remains "well positioned" to meet its medium-term growth targets to financial 2023. AA also said it is "well 
positioned" to see Ebitda growth in financial 2020.
AA's financial year ends January 31.
Fed Chair Powell pledged the central bank will take appropriate actions to sustain the US economic expansion. 
Powell mentioned recent developments involving trade negotiations and other matters in opening remarks at a 
Chicago Fed conference on Tuesday, acknowledging that the Fed does not know how or when these issues will be 
resolved.
"We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the US economic outlook and, as always, we 
will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2% 
objective," Powell said.
The rest of Powell's speech focused on longer-run issues, but the Fed chief's initial comments generated optimism 
about a potential interest rate cut and spurred a rally on Wall Street.
Powell's comments come after St Louis Fed President James Bullard suggested in a speech on Monday that an 
interest rate cut "may be warranted soon" due in part to escalating global trade tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ending up 2.1%, the S&P 500 up 2.1% and Nasdaq Composite up 2.7%.
In Asia on Wednesday, the Japanese Nikkei 225 closed up 1.8%. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.1%, 
and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.5%.
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Non-Standard Finance Deal For Provident Off
Sterling was quoted at USD1.2706 early Wednesday, higher than USD1.2675 at the London equities close on 
Wednesday.
US President Donald Trump on Tuesday promised a "phenomenal" trade deal between the UK and US on his 
second day of a three-day state visit to the UK. "As the UK makes preparations to exit the EU, the US is committed 
to a phenomenal trade deal between the US and the UK," Trump said. "There is tremendous potential in that trade 
deal, I say probably two and even three times what we're doing right now."
The economic events calendar on Wednesday has Markit services PMI readings from France, Germany, the 
Eurozone and the UK at 0850 BST, 0855 BST, 0900 BST and 0930 BST, respectively.
Later in the day, there is Eurozone producer price index at 1000 BST and US Markit PMI reading at 1445 BST.
Already out, China's private sector activity growth moderated to a three-month low in May partly driven by softer 
rise in services activity, survey results published by IHS Markit revealed.
The Caixin composite output index fell to 51.5 in May from 52.7 in April. Nonetheless, the score remained above 
50.0 for the thirty-ninth consecutive month, suggesting continuing expansion in the sector.
The services Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to a 3-month low of 52.7 in May from 54.5 in April. However, the 
score was consistent with a robust rise in output amid firm client demand.

LONDON (Alliance News) - JPMorgan started coverage on International Consolidated Airlines Group with a Buy 
rating and said the airline operator diversified portfolio and high profit margins can facilitate strong returns for 
shareholders. 
The US bank placed a EUR8.35 price target on the stock. IAG shares were up 2.1% at 472.80 pence on 
Wednesday. 
IAG is a Spanish registered company with shares traded on the London and Madrid stock exchanges and was born 
following the merger between British Airways and Iberia, the flag carrier airlines of the UK and Spain respectively.
IAG is not an airline itself, rather operates as an owner of a portfolio of airlines, which also includes Ireland's Aer 
Lingus and Spain's low cost carrier Vueling. 
The company is headquartered in London and employs only 100 people. IAG emphasises that it is not merely a 
holding company, and that its role is to extract synergies across its airlines and to add value to each of them.
IAG shares are 30% lower so far in 2019, having warned shareholders that profits for the year will be flat. 
Moreover, airlines have cited Brexit uncertainty, the general weakness of the European economy, and a competitive 
environment in Germany and Austria, where multiple airlines are still fighting to grow market share after the 
collapse of Air Berlin in August 2017. The two biggest European low cost airlines Ryanair and easyJet have 
significantly lowered profit guidance, in part due to weaker than expected fares.
JPMorgan's David Perry and Andrew Fincher highlighted that many investors are concerned that IAG's earnings 
growth would be at risk should a recession occur if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal.
IN THE KNOW: JPMorgan Thinks IAG 's Shareholder Return Can Rise Further
"A hard Brexit would certainly be challenging. First, UK shareholders would likely lose voting rights and may be 
forced to sell their shares. Second, if the pound fell 10% versus the dollar and the euro, it could take 20% off 
earnings per share via transaction and translation impacts. However, we do not believe a hard Brexit would have a 
material impact on trans-Atlantic travel (where IAG is most profitable)," the pair said. 
The analysts also believe IAG's valuation is mispriced compared to peers easyJet and Ryanair.
"We believe IAG is materially mispriced against Ryanair and easyJet. IAG's earnings befrore interest and tax 
margin and return on capital employed are now as good as Ryanair and much better than those of easyJet. But 
relative to these two low cost carriers, IAG is trading on 55% to 65% price to earnings discount and a 30% to 45% 
EV/EBIT discount," the pair noted. 
Perry and Fincher said one of IAG's key strategies is to acquire entire airlines or assets from failing airlines focused 
in Europe, but there are concerns among investors that the company company can make an "overpriced" 
acquisition. 
"IAG says it is willing to issue equity for the right deal. However, it also acknowledges that opportunities for M&A 
are quite rare and currently it has few options. We suspect IAG's best opportunity to make meaningful acquisitions 
will come when/if the European airline industry enters its next major downturn," the analysts said. 
Perry and Fincher also highlighted the company's strong cash returns as a positive, with a special dividend 
payment due in July and believe there is scope for this to continue. 
"We also believe investors are overlooking IAG's attractions: high pretax profit margins; a diversified portfolio that 
should mean more resilient earnings than in the past; strong market positions; a strong balance sheet; and rising 
cash returns to shareholders," the pair added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Both Liberum and UBS remained bullish on Ryanair, despite the budget airline's weak 
annual results and a challenging market backdrop, though both downgraded their forecasts. 
Ryanair shares were down 1.4% at EUR10.48 on Wednesday, having shed 37% compared to this time a year ago.
UBS said it was disappointed by Ryanair's annual results and, in addition, the outlook for the year ahead was 
weaker than expected despite easy comparatives. 
For the financial year ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 41% 
from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, which Ryanair 
snapped up in December.
Late Austrian entrepreneur and former Formula One champion Niki Lauda originally founded the airline under the 
name Niki in 2003 and sold it to the Air Berlin group in 2011. Following Air Berlin's bankruptcy, he bought it back in 
2018 and re-established it as Laudamotion with the help of London-listed Thomas Cook.
Group revenue rose 6% to EUR7.69 billion from EUR7.15 billion, with an increase in both scheduled and ancillary 
revenue. 
"While first half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue 
through summer 2019. We have zero second half visibility," Ryanair commented alongside its results.
UBS downgraded its 2020 earnings per share forecast by 8% to EUR0.92 - though still above consensus at 
EUR0.87 - but said it thinks average fares should rise 1%, which would be at the top end of Ryanair's guided range. 
The Swiss bank said it thinks the fare environment should improve over the summer given the benign capacity 
outlook. 
IN THE KNOW: Analysts Cut Forecasts But Ryanair Still Top Airline Pick
UBS cut its price target on the stock to EUR14.45 from EUR15.25, but kept its Buy rating.
Liberum similarly maintained its Buy recommendation on the stock, though lowered its target to EUR12.50 from 
EUR14.50.
"The airline industry faces numerous short-term headwinds. The demand outlook is potentially softening, fuel prices 
remain high and Brexit uncertainty persists. However, Ryanair's long-term fundamentals remain intact and 
attractive, with a low cost base, market leadership, a robust balance sheet and strong cash generation," argued 
Liberum.
The broker cut its 2020 profit after tax forecast to EUR844 to match Ryanair's new guidance range, from EUR1.03 
billion predicted previously by Liberum, and noted that while the industry capacity environment is more supportive 
than last summer, macroeconomic uncertainty is weighing on demand.
Despite this, Ryanair remains Europe's "long-term winner" the broker maintained. 
Tougher maker conditions should actually act as a boon to Ryanair in the short term, as it weeds out weaker 
competitors and aids consolidation, Liberum added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - News in the consumer services sector this week continued to highlight struggles in the 
travel sector, with Irish budget airline Ryanair reporting a significant fall in profit. 
Meanwhile, results from retailers Marks & Spencer and B&M European Value Retail showed improved 
performances in the retail sector, as both reported a profit jump.
Ryanair started the week posting a 41% drop in annual pretax profit to EUR948.1 million due to higher oil prices, up 
23% in the year, and lower fares in a competitive market. Group revenue, for the year to march 31, rose 6% to 
EUR7.69 billion.
Furthermore, the low-cost airline warned of "zero" visibility on its results beyond the next few months.
Ryanair was not the only struggling airline in a year which saw a number of EU airlines failing including Primera, 
Sky Works and WOW. Flybe was sold, while both Alitalia and Thomas Cook's airline are currently for sale.
With regards to the sale of its airline, travel operator Thomas Cook on Thursday confirmed receiving an offer from 
private equity firm Triton Partners for its Nordic operations.
The travel company's Nordic business comprises of its tour operator and airline in Norway, Sweden, Finland and 
Denmark.
Thomas Cook said it was evaluating the offer alongside its ongoing strategic review of its group airline. The group 
said it has so far received multiple bids for parts and the whole of the airline business.
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Airlines Struggle, Retail Recovers
Also on Thursday, Thomas Cook received less positive news, with Fitch, S&P and Moody's downgrading the stock 
on concerns of weak trading and further deterioration.
Meanwhile, retailers seemed to be having a better time. 
On Wednesday, homeware, clothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer Group reported a moderate decline in 
revenue but double-digit profit growth in its recently-ended financial year to March.
M&S said pretax profit rose 27% to GBP84.6 million despite revenue falling 3.0% to GBP10.38 billion. This was 
achieved thanks to the ongoing transformation programme launched by the company with the aim of delivering cost 
savings and growing the business. 
However, looking ahead M&S said it expects net store closures to reduce sales by 1% in its UK Food division, while 
in the UK Clothing & Home unit, sales are anticipated to fall by 3% in the new year.
On Thursday, discount homewares retailer B&M European Value Retail also reported a positive annual 
performance with both revenue and profit increasing on the prior year.
For the year ended March 30, B&M posted pretax profit up 8.7% to GBP249.4 million and revenue increased 17% 
to GBP3.48 billion. UK B&M store fascia revenue rose 8.7%, 0.7% on a like-for-like basis.
Furthermore, reflecting the positive results, B&M upped its total payout 5.7% to 7.6 pence.
Looking ahead, the company reported a "pleasing start" to the first quarter of financial 2020, with mid-single digit 
like-for-like growth in B&M UK fascia stores.
Meanwhile on Friday, struggling baby products retailer Mothercare also published improved results as the effects of 
its restructuring programme slashed costs by 29%. 
This resulted in Mothercare's pretax loss narrowing to GBP66.6 million for the year to March 30, compared to the 
GBP94.0 million loss reported the year earlier.
However, revenue also declined by 12% to GBP513.8 million from GBP580.6 million the year before, due to the 
chain's UK store closure programme. 
"We have achieved a huge amount this year, refinancing, restructuring and reorganising Mothercare to ensure a 
sustainable future for the business," said Chief Executive Mark Newton-Jones. "Whilst this major restructuring 
activity has resulted in significant headline losses for the year, the business is now on a sounder financial footing." 
Lastly, FTSE 250 stationery & books retailer WH Smith on Tuesday announced its chief executive's departure, as 
sales in the third quarter of the year improved significantly. 
After 15 years with WH Smith, six of which as CEO, Stephen Clarke will step down from the board at the end of 
October, as he plans to "take a break".
Carl Cowling, managing director of the company's High Street business, will take over the role of CEO from 
November 1.
On the same day, reflecting improvements in the retail sector, WH Smith reported a 15% sales increase, 1% on a 
like-for-like basis in the 11-week period from March 1 to May 18.
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Airlines Struggle, Retail Recovers
The company's Travel unit saw sales up 26% while the High Street business continued to experience struggles with 
sales down by 1%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - HSBC downgraded Ryanair Holdings to Reduce from Hold saying challenges are piling 
up for the Irish airline, including Brexit, weakening European economies, reduced travel demand, and higher costs. 
The bank cut its price target to EUR9.40 from EUR12.00. Ryanair shares were down 3.1% at EUR10.13 on 
Wednesday in London.
Ryanair on Monday reported a significant fall in profit in a year which saw many EU airlines struggle due to higher 
oil prices and lower fares in a competitive market, and warned of "zero" visibility on its results beyond the next few 
months.
For the financial year that ended March 31, the budget carrier reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 41% 
from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's Austrian 
airline established by Niki Lauda and acquired by Ryanair in December. The former Formula 1 racing champion 
died earlier this week.
HSBC's Andrew Lobbenberg and Achal Kumar said evidence from the market is that air passenger demand has not 
recovered. The pair pointed to travel demand remaining weak, with airlines and tour operators securing bookings 
with price incentives. 
"We do not think the situation will change for the important late summer bookings, since we will likely only be 
getting closer to the new October Brexit deadline. Away from the UK, we think economic growth continues to slow 
with political uncertainty in Italy and with global trade concerns in Germany," Lobbenberg and Kumar said. 
In the UK, political uncertainty relating to Brexit has hurt demand for air travel, with low-cost carriers, as well as tour 
operators feeling the effects. The companies continue to fill their UK-based aircraft; however weaker consumer 
demand equates to weaker unit revenue.
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Faces Higher Costs, Less Demand And Brexit - HSBC
"In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Ryanair would face significant ownership and control issues. Its UK ownership 
would not count towards its EU ownership count, leaving it some 20%, we estimate, short of majority EU ownership 
and control, which is required to sustain its Irish Air Operators Certificate. Ryanair would also be highly vulnerable 
to weak consumer demand for UK outbound and also UK inbound travel," the analysts said. 
With regards to Boeing 737 Max aircraft, which was grounded following two deadly accidents, Ryanair said it has 
delayed the delivery of its first five 737 Max jets to Winter 2019. 
Lobbenberg and Kumar said delay in delivery of the more efficient aircraft will weigh slightly on Ryanair's unit costs, 
but the main threat lies in the uncertainty from planning and crewing.
"We also think there is a risk that any public difference of opinions among aviation regulators around the world 
could bring the Max aircraft into the headlines once again. This could, at least in the first instance, create some 
consumer reluctance to fly the aircraft, which could weigh on Ryanair's unit revenues," the pair said. 
The analysts also think fleet growth at Lauda is weighing on the stock. At Lauda, Ryanair plans to grow the fleet 
from 10 aircraft in summer 2018, to 23 aircraft in summer 2019 and 35 in summer 2020.
"Lauda's profitability is weak; its Airbus aircraft leased from the market will not have the ownership cost advantage 
of Ryanair’s legacy 737NG fleet. Lauda is focussing its growth in Vienna which is suffering acute excess capacity, 
with April 2019 traffic growing 26%. This is not sustainable, in our view," the pair added. 
Also reflecting the difficult times in the airline industry, Ryanair's rival easyJet on Friday last week reported a sharp 
widening to its interim loss also due to an increase in fuel costs. 
HSBC reiterated its Hold rating on easyJet and 1,100p price target on the stock. easyJet was down 4.2% at 
943.20p Wednesday.
The analysts said easyJet is in a "surprisingly good place", with improved cost guidance particularly encouraging, 
while consumer and labour engagement scores are also strong.
"We have high regard for the company's strategic position within the industry and the stock has fallen 20% in the 
last month. It is only 10% above its five year low dating from June 2016 in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Why are 
we not buyers? Given the multiple macro challenges, our 2019 pretax profit estimate sits below what was the 
company-sourced running consensus into interim results, which was endorsed by the company as a sensible 
forecast for year profits," the pair said of easyJet. 
"We are not at all confident that the company has navigated its last profit warning. Airline share prices do trade in 
line with earnings momentum and we are unsure we have passed any inflection point."

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a significant fall in its annual profit due to 
increased fuel, airport and staff costs.
For the financial year that ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 
41% from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's 
Austrian airline established by former Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda and acquired by Ryanair in December. 
Group revenue rose 6% to EUR7.69 billion from EUR7.15 billion, with an increase in both scheduled and ancillary 
revenue. 
Fuel & oil costs rose 23% to EUR2.42 billion from EUR1.90 billion, staff costs increased 28% to EUR945.0 million 
from EUR738.5 million, and airport charges rose 9% to EUR1.02 billion from EUR938.6 million, hurting profit.
"As previously guided, Ryanair, excluding Lauda, reports a full year after tax profit of EUR1.02 billion. Short-haul 
capacity growth and the absence of Easter in the fourth quarter led to a 6% fare decline, which stimulated 7% traffic 
growth to over 139 million," Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary commented.
During the year, Ryanair saw a 7% increase in traffic - meaning the number of passengers carries - to 139.1 million 
from 130.3 million. 
Load factor - a key measure for the airline industry - rose 1% to 96%. 
Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in financial 2020 to 153 million passengers. However, assuming 
revenue per pax growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for  broadly flat group profit, including Lauda. This will range from 
EUR750 million if RPP rises 2%, up to EUR950 million if RPP rises 4%.

"While first half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue 
through Summer 2019. We have zero second half visibility," the company added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday reported a significant fall in profit in a year which saw 
many EU airlines struggle due to higher oil prices and lower fares in a competitive market, and it warned of "zero" 
visibility on its results beyond the next few months.
More positively, Ryanair approved a EUR700 million share buyback which will commence later this week and run 
for the next 9 to 12 months. 
The stock was down 5.7% in London at EUR10.18 on Monday morning, leading a wider decline among travel 
stocks.
For the financial year that ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 
41% from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's

from 130.3 million. 
EXTRA: Ryanair Annual Profit Drops 40% Amid Tough Year For Airlines
Load factor - a key measure for the airline industry - rose by one percentage point to 96%. 
Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in financial 2020 to 153 million passengers. However, assuming 
revenue per passenger growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for broadly flat group profit, including Lauda. This will range 
from EUR750 million if RPP rises 2%, up to EUR950 million if RPP rises 4%. 
"While first half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue 
through Summer 2019. We have zero second half visibility," the company added.
With regards to Boeing 737 Max aircraft, which was grounded following two deadly accidents, Ryanair said it has 
delayed the delivery of its first five 737 Max jets to Winter 2019. 
"We continue to have utmost confidence in these aircraft which have 4% more seats, are 16% more fuel efficient 
and generate 40% lower noise emissions," Ryanair said. 
The delayed arrival however, will mean that the company will not see any meaningful cost benefit from the new jets 
until financial 2021.
Ryanair also noted that during the past year a number of EU airlines failed including Primera, Sky Works and 
WOW. Flybe was sold, while both Alitalia and Thomas Cook airline are currently for sale.
Also reflecting the difficult times in the airline industry, Ryanair rival easyJet PLC on Friday last week reported a 
sharp widening to its interim loss also due to an increase in fuel costs. 
In the six months to March 31, easyJet's pretax loss came in at GBP272 million compared to GBP68 million 
reported for the same period a year earlier. Revenue increased 7.3% to GBP2.34 billion in the period.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum described Ryanair's guidance as "disappointing", with investors also likely to 
be disheartened by persistent non-fuel unit cost inflation. 
Shares in the budget airline were down 4.9% at EUR10.28 on Monday. Liberum kept its Buy rating and a EUR14.50 
price target on the stock.
For the financial year ended March 31, the Irish carrier reported a pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 41% from 
EUR1.61 billion the year prior. 
Operating profit of EUR1.19 billion, down 29% year-on-year, was below consensus of EUR1.21 billion but above 
Liberum's estimate of EUR1.18 billion.
Group revenue rose 6% to EUR7.56 billion from EUR7.15 billion, with an increase in both scheduled and ancillary 
revenue. However, this was below both Liberum's revenue expectation of EUR7.59 billion and consensus of 
EUR7.69 billion. 
Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in its recently commenced financial year to 153 million 
passengers. However, assuming revenue per passenger growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for broadly flat group profit, 
including Lauda. 
This will range from EUR750 million if revenue per passenger rises 2%, and up to EUR950 million if revenue per 
passenger rises 4%. 
In addition, non-fuel unit costs are set to rise by 2% due to a stronger pound, Lauda costs, and delays to the 
delivery of new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Called "Long-Term Winner" Despite Weak Guidance
Liberum deemed this guidance "disappointing" relative to consensus, which had lay above the higher end of 
Ryanair's outlook at around EUR977 million. 
"While management's caution on average fares is typical, especially at this stage of the year, there seems to be 
clear reliance upon strong ancillary revenue to deliver overall improvements in revenue per passenger," said 
Liberum. "There may also be disappointment at non-fuel unit cost inflation persisting."
Nonetheless, the broker said Ryanair remains the "long-term winner" in the European airline space. 
A tougher market in the short-term will benefit Ryanair in the long-term as the operating environment "clears out" 
weaker competitors and aids consolidation. 
Ryanair trades on a price to earnings ratio of 11.9 times, which Liberum said is "reasonable" even allowing for likely 
consensus downgrades following Monday's results.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May is set to begin discussions with senior ministers on her proposed new "bold offer" 
to members of Parliament in a final attempt to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. The weekly meeting of the 
Cabinet on Tuesday is expected to sign off on a package of measures to be included in the forthcoming Withdrawal 
Agreement Bill aimed at winning cross-party support. However there was widespread scepticism at Westminster 
that it will fare any better than her three previous failed attempts to get the Commons to pass the deal. It comes at 
the start of what looks likely to be another torrid week for the prime minister with the Conservatives braced for a 
hammering at the hands of Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in the European elections on Thursday.

The average price tag on a home coming freshly onto the market jumped by over GBP2,800 in May – meaning 
house hunters in some areas now face record high amounts being demanded by sellers. Across Britain, the 
average asking price is GBP308,290 – GBP2,841 or 0.9% higher than in April, according to the figures from 
Rightmove. The website, whose records go back over a decade, said Wales, the Midlands and the North West of

Japan's gross domestic product climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.5% on quarter in the first quarter of 2019, the 
Cabinet Office said in a preliminary reading. That beat forecasts for a fall 0.1% and was up from the downwardly 
revised 0.4% gain in the three months prior, which was originally reported as 0.5%. On an annualized yearly basis, 
GDP was up 2.1% - again exceeding expectations for a fall of 0.2% following the downwardly revised 1.6% gain in 
the previous three months - originally 1.9%.

US President Donald Trump vowed Sunday to deny Tehran nuclear weapons just hours after threatening it would 
"be the official end of Iran" when the country's Revolutionary Guard said it was not afraid of war. "I will not let Iran 
have nuclear weapons," Trump told Fox News. "I don't want to fight. But you do have situations like Iran, you can't 
let them have nuclear weapons - you just can't let that happen," he said. Prior to the interview Trump had appeared 
to escalate the growing threat of conflict when he used social media to respond to Iran's Revolutionary Guard 
saying it was not afraid of war. "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the US 
again!" Trump wrote on Twitter, seemingly in response to comments Revolutionary Guard Corps commander 
Hossein Salami made earlier in the day.

US energy company Exxon Mobil's evacuation of its foreign staff from a major Iraqi oil field is "unacceptable and 
unjustified," Iraqi Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban said Sunday. On Saturday, the US-based firm evacuated 50 US 
employees from Iraq and flew them to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates amid escalating tensions between the US 
and Iran, according to sources in the Iraqi oil industry. Ghadhban said Sunday the evacuations were not due to 
security threats in Iraq, instead blaming "political reasons, attributed to political tensions in the region." The 50 
evacuees had worked at the West Qurna 1 oil field in Iraq's southern province of Basra.

Another seat was added on Monday to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative coalition as he 
inched closer to forming majority government two days after the federal election. The Australian Electoral 
Commission's latest figures showed Morrison's Liberal Party coalition with the Nationals was projected to win 75 
seats, just one short of a majority in the 151-member lower house of parliament.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called for fresh elections "as soon as possible" after a corruption scandal 
forced his deputy - the leader of the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) - to step down. Kurz told a press conference in 
Vienna that his conservative People's Party could no longer work in a coalition with the FPOe. "After yesterday's 
video, I must honestly say that enough is enough," he said. Kurz said he had made his position known to Austrian 
President Alexander Van der Bellen, who later said a new election was necessary to regain the trust of the Austrian 
public. The announcement comes one day after two German media outlets showed footage of FPOe leader Heinz-
Christian Strache offering government contracts in return for financial backing from a woman posing as a potential 
party donor and niece of a Russian oligarch.

Subprime lender Provident Financial received the backing of one of its prominent shareholders as it fends off the 
advances of smaller peer Non-Standard Finance. Asset manager Schroders, which holds a 15% stake in Provident, 
reiterated its view that Non-Standard Finance's offer is not in the best interest of Provident shareholders. Last week, 
Non-Standard Finance said its offer for Provident Financial has become unconditional. "We remain of the view that

the board's expectations. For the quarter ended March 31, revenue was GBP23.8 million compared to GBP24.5 
million in the first quarter last year. The company said revenue in its sales business declined as conditions in the 
London property market remains "very challenging". Moreover, Foxtons said sales volumes continue to be at record 
low levels and ongoing Brexit uncertainty is hurting consumer confidence. Revenue in its lettings business was 
marginally ahead of the prior year, continuing its progress following the initiatives the company implemented in 
2018.

Project management consultant WYG has agreed to GBP43.4 million all-cash takeover offer from Tetra Tech. The

Alphabet's Google has reportedly blocked Chinese communications company Huawei from using apps on its 
phones. Huawei is one of a number of phone manufacturers who use the Google-developed Android operating 
systems on its phones and tablets. The Verge has reported that Google has cut off Huawei's licence – meaning it 
will no longer be able to use apps like Maps and Gmail and will not have access to security updates. Existing 
customers will be able to update their phones and apps, but will not be able to update to a newer version of the 
Android operating system if one becomes available. Android said it had taken steps to "comply with the recent US 
government actions". This could be a reference to US president Donald Trump's executive order apparently aimed 
at banning Huawei's equipment from US networks and said it was subjecting the Chinese company to strict export 
controls.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.
----------
COMPANIES
----------
Ryanair Holdings reported a significant fall in profit in a year which saw many EU airlines struggle due to higher oil 
prices and lower fares in a competitive market, and it warned of "zero" visibility on its results beyond the next few 
months. More positively, Ryanair approved a EUR700 million share buyback which will commence later this week 
and run for the next 9 to 12 months. For the financial year ended March 31, the Irish airline reported pretax profit of 
EUR948.1 million, down 41% from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at 
Lauda, Ryanair's Austrian airline.Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in financial 2020 to 153 million 
passengers. However, assuming revenue per passenger growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for broadly flat group profit, 
including Lauda. This will range from EUR750 million if RPP rises 2%, up to EUR950 million if RPP rises 4%. 
----------
Softcat said it expects its annual results to be "slightly ahead" of previous expectations, as trading in the quarter to 
the end of April was strong. The FTSE 250-listed IT infrastructure provider said it continued to preform well in the 
three months to April 30, delivering "strong year-on-year growth" across all income and profit measures. 
"Performance drivers remained broad-based, with different technology areas and customer segments all showing 
growth," Softcat said. The company added that progress towards the opening of a new office in Birmingham is "well 
advanced". It expects the opening to occur early in the next financial year.

Foxtons Group said revenue declined in the first quarter as Brexit and a weak market in London took a toll on sales. 
Furthermore Mark Berry, the real estate agent's chief financial officer, will step down from Foxtons' board on June 
24 in "mutual agreement" with the company. Richard Harris has been appointed as CFO with effect from the same 
date. Foxtons said that performance in the three months ended March 31, was in line with the board's expectations. 
Group revenue came in at GBP23.8 million, down from GBP24.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Sales revenue 
amounted to GBP7.1 million, down from GBP8.2 million a year prior, while lettings revenue was GBP14.6 million, 
broadly flat on GBP14.3 million a year ago.
----------
MARKETS
----------
London shares were lower amid the trade standoff between the US and China, with travel stocks weighing on the 
FTSE 100 following disappointing annual results from Ryanair. Oil was up after OPEC indicated it may sustain 
previous production cuts. Wall Street was pointed to a lower open. 
----------

----------
ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is set to begin discussions with senior ministers on her proposed new "bold offer" 
to members of Parliament in a final attempt to get her Brexit deal through Parliament. The weekly meeting of the 
Cabinet on Tuesday is expected to sign off on a package of measures to be included in the forthcoming Withdrawal 
Agreement Bill aimed at winning cross-party support. However there was widespread scepticism at Westminster 
that it will fare any better than her three previous failed attempts to get the Commons to pass the deal. Following 
the collapse last week of cross-party talks with Labour aimed at reaching a common approach, Jeremy Corbyn said 
he had not yet seen anything new that would persuade him to support it. It comes at the start of what looks likely to 
be another torrid week for the prime minister with the Conservatives braced for a hammering at the hands of Nigel 
Farage's Brexit Party in the European elections on Thursday.
----------
Alphabet Inc's Google has confirmed it has blocked Huawei from updating some parts of its Android software used 
on Huawei phones to comply with a US government order blacklisting the Chinese firm. The tech giant said it was 
"complying with the order and reviewing the implications", but assured Huawei users that their current phones 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair Annual Profit Falls; Unveils Share Buyback
would continue to work. Last week, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively banning the 
Chinese firm from using US technology without government permission. "For users of our services, Google Play 
and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices," a 
Google spokesman said. The block is likely to prevent future updates to Android reaching Huawei devices. Key 
Google apps such as the Google Play Store, Gmail and Google Maps may also not appear on future Huawei 
devices. Instead, the Chinese firm would be reliant on the version of Android available through an open source 
licence, which is vastly more limited in its features.
----------
The average price tag on a home coming freshly onto the market jumped by over GBP2,800 in May – meaning 
house hunters in some areas now face record high amounts being demanded by sellers. Across Britain, the 
average asking price is GBP308,290 – GBP2,841 or 0.9% higher than in April, according to the figures from 
Rightmove. The website, whose records go back over a decade, said Wales, the Midlands and the North West of 
England are "bucking any Brexit blues" – with average asking prices in these areas having reached new all-time 
highs.
----------
US President Donald Trump vowed Sunday to deny Tehran nuclear weapons just hours after threatening it would 
"be the official end of Iran" when the country's Revolutionary Guard said it was not afraid of war. "I will not let Iran 
have nuclear weapons," Trump told Fox News. "I don't want to fight. But you do have situations like Iran, you can't 
let them have nuclear weapons - you just can't let that happen," he said. Prior to the interview Trump had appeared 
to escalate the growing threat of conflict when he used social media to respond to Iran's Revolutionary Guard 
saying it was not afraid of war. "If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the US 
again!" Trump wrote on Twitter, seemingly in response to comments Revolutionary Guard Corps commander 
Hossein Salami made earlier in the day.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London were seen opening higher on Monday amid mixed trading in 
Asia, ahead of another busy week of company earnings reports and politically sensitive elections to the European 
Parliament.
In early company news, Ryanair Holdings annual profit slumped 40% on higher fuel costs, Softcat said trading 
remains in line with expectations, and Provident Financial received the backing of one of its major shareholders in 
its ongoing battle with Non-Standard Finance. WYG agreed to a GBP43.4 million takeover.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open up 11.68 points at 7,360.30. The blue-chip index closed down 
4.89 points, or 0.1%, at 7,348.62 on Friday.
Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings reported a significant fall in its annual profit due to increased fuel, airport and staff 
costs.
For the financial year that ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 
41% from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's 
Austrian airline established by former Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda and acquired by Ryanair in December.
Group revenue rose 6% to EUR7.69 billion from EUR7.15 billion, with an increase in both scheduled and ancillary 
revenue.
Fuel & oil costs rose 23% to EUR2.42 billion from EUR1.90 billion, staff costs increased 28% to EUR945.0 million 
from EUR738.5 million, and airport charges rose 9% to EUR1.02 billion from EUR938.6 million, hurting profit.

Japan's gross domestic product climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.5% on quarter in the first quarter of 2019, the 
Cabinet Office said in Monday's preliminary reading.
That beat forecasts for a fall 0.1% and was up from the downwardly revised 0.4% gain in the three months prior, 
which was originally reported as 0.5%. On an annualized yearly basis, GDP was up 2.1% - again exceeding 
expectations for a fall of 0.2% following the downwardly revised 1.6% gain in the previous three months - originally 
1.9%.
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4%, S&P 500 down 
0.6% and Nasdaq Composite ending 1.0% lower.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May is preparing to make a "bold offer" to members of Parliament in a final attempt to 
get her beleaguered Brexit deal through Parliament and onto the statue book before she leaves office.
Minister will begin discussions on Monday on a package of measures to be included in the forthcoming Withdrawal 
Agreement Bill aimed at securing cross-party support. The weekly meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday will then 
consider plans for a series of "indicative votes" in the Commons to establish which proposals could command a 
majority in the House.
The move follows the final collapse on Friday of cross-party talks with Labour aimed at finding an agreed way 
forward which would allow Britain to leave the EU with a deal.
"As it becomes clearer that Prime Minister Theresa May's premiership is in its final death throes attention is shifting 
to a number of different outcomes, including but not confined to, who her successor is likely to be, the collapse of 
the government, a new election and the prospect of a possible minority Labour government," added Hewson.
The economic events calendar on Monday has eurozone current account numbers at 1000 BST.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Travel stocks were among the worst performers at the start of the week following 
disappointing results from Ryanair, as London stocks in general saw broad-based losses amid continuation of US-
China trade spat.
The FTSE 100 was down 54.06 points, or 0.7%, at 7,294.56 Monday midday. The mid-cap FTSE 250 was down 
139.54 points, or 0.7%, at 19,359.07. The AIM All-Share was down 0.1% at 958.20.
The Cboe UK 100 index was down 0.8% at 12,369.86. The Cboe UK 250 was down 0.7% at 17,393.69, though the 
Cboe UK Small Companies was flat at 11,848.70.
"News that the decision to implement auto tariffs would be delayed caused a recovery into the end of last week, but 
this morning we received a timely reminder that this could well get worse before it gets better," commented David 
Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB.
Alphabet Inc's Google confirmed it has blocked Huawei from updating some parts of its Android software used on 
Huawei phones to comply with a US government order blacklisting the Chinese firm.
The tech giant said it was "complying with the order and reviewing the implications", but assured Huawei users that 
their current phones would continue to work.
Last week, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively banning the Chinese firm from using 
US technology without government permission.

Meanwhile, the UK Government has said it is yet to make a decision on whether to allow another part of Huawei's 
business, its telecoms equipment, to be a part of new 5G networks in the UK.
Remaining in the UK, the contest to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May is hotting up, with potential leadership 
candidates setting out their stalls.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out a bid for the job, saying he had a "strong view about the sort of 
leader we need". Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has already confirmed he will stand in the race to replace 
May, which is due to officially begin within weeks.
The prime minister will set out the timetable for her exit and the leadership contest to succeed her after a crunch 
vote on the legislation for her Brexit deal in early June.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2739 at midday, broadly unchanged from USD1.2737 late Friday.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 1.2% and 1.3% respectively. 
In the US, Wall Street is on track for a downbeat start to the week. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 are both called 
down 0.1%, while the Nasdaq is pointed 0.5% lower. 
Oil was largely unchanged start of the week, quoted at USD72.62 Monday midday versus USD72.60 late Friday 
amid further deterioration in US-Iranian relations. 
The price of Brent had surpassed USD73 a barrel overnight before falling back in morning trade.
US President Donald Trump vowed Sunday to deny Tehran nuclear weapons just hours after threatening it would 
"be the official end of Iran" when the country's Revolutionary Guard said it was not afraid of war.
"If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the US again!" Trump wrote on Twitter, 
seemingly in response to comments Revolutionary Guard Corps commander Hossein Salami made earlier in the 
day.
Tensions have been escalating between the two countries since Tehran announced it would begin a partial 
withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, from which Washington pulled out of last year.
"With Donald Trump threatening the Iran's aggression towards the US would see 'the end' of the Islamic Republic, 
there was plenty reasoning behind the weekend gap higher. However, we are also seeing cracks in the OPEC+ 
story, with the Russians talking about a potential easing of the output restrictions," said Joshua Mahony, senior 
market analyst at IG.
"Saudi threats that any relaxing of the current production levels could spark a glut of oil on the market have certainly 
raised concerns amongst crude traders, with prices falling in early trade today," he added.
As well as a volatile oil price hitting travel stocks - on fears of higher fuel prices - disappointing guidance from 
budget airline Ryanair.
Irish carrier Ryanair, down 2.5% at midday, reported a 41% fall in annual profit to EUR948.1 million despite revenue 
rising 6% to EUR7.69 billion.
Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in financial 2020 to 153 million passengers. However, assuming 
revenue per passenger growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for broadly flat group profit, including Lauda. This will range 
from EUR750 million if revenue per passenger rises 2%, up to EUR950 million if revenue per passenger rises 4%. 
LONDON MARKET MIDDAY: Airline Stocks Dip; Another Setback For Huawei
"While first half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue 
through Summer 2019. We have zero second half visibility," the company added.
Ryanair's results hit other airlines in a negative read-across, with FTSE 100 constituents TUI and easyJet down 
3.7% and 1.3% respectively. 
Beleaguered travel agent Thomas Cook was down 18%, furthering Friday's 40% slide after analysts at Citigroup cut 
the stock's price target to zero following a sharply wider interim loss. 
In the FTSE 250, Merlin Entertainments slipped 6.2% after HSBC cut the Legoland owner to Reduce from Buy. 
Also hurting from a rating downgrade was Metro Bank, lowered to Sell from Hold by Investec. 
This comes following a turbulent period for the challenger bank, as it last week raised more than initially anticipated 
after being hit by macroeconomic difficulties, such as regulatory changes and a low-interest rate environment, as 
well as "company-specific factors".
In January, the lender announced it had underestimated the risk on its commercial loans and needed to raise 
capital to compensate for the shortfall.
Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings, meanwhile, motored to the top of the mid-caps as Bernstein boosted the 
luxury car maker to Outperform from Market Perform. 
IT infrastructure firm Softcat rose 1.9% as the firm said its annual results are expected to be "slightly ahead" of prior 
expectations. The FTSE 250 constituent said it continued to preform well in the three months to April 30, delivering 
"strong year-on-year growth" across all income and profit measures.

LONDON (Alliance News) - London stocks started the new week on the back foot following another knock back for 
Chinese tech giant Huawei amid an ongoing US-Sino trade saga.
Travel stocks also played a role in denting the FTSE 100's performance on Monday after some ill-received 
guidance from budget airline Ryanair knocked peers in a negative read-across. 
However, London's blue-chip index managed to avoid the sharper loss of its European peers as the pound 
remained weak ahead of the likely return of UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal in June. 
The FTSE 100 index closed down 37.74 points, or 0.5%, at 7,310.88. The FTSE 250 ended down 163.02 points, or 
0.8%, at 19,335.59, and the AIM All-Share closed down 1.68 points, or 0.2%, at 957.01.

halting supplies to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei amid a White House ban has intensified the risk-off sentiment," 
said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index. 
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Huawei Blow And Ryanair Woe Puts Pressure On FTSE
Alphabet Inc's Google confirmed it has blocked Huawei from updating some parts of its Android software used on 
Huawei phones to comply with a US government order blacklisting the Chinese firm.
Last week, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively banning the Chinese firm from using 
US technology without government permission. This came after the US increased tariffs to 25% on USD200 billion 
worth of Chinese products.
However, the dollar earner-heavy FTSE 100 posted less severe falls compared to European counterparts "thanks 
to cushioning from the pound", Cincotta noted. 
The pound was quoted at USD1.2731 at the London equities close Monday, soft compared to USD1.2737 at the 
close on Friday.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is set to begin discussions with senior ministers on her proposed new "bold offer" 
to members of Parliament in a final attempt to get her Brexit deal passed.
The weekly meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday is expected to sign off on a package of measures to be included in 
the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill aimed at winning cross-party support.
However, there was widespread scepticism at Westminster that it will fare any better than her three previous failed 
attempts to get the Commons to pass the deal - all having failed with resounding margins.
Following the collapse last week of cross-party talks with Labour aimed at reaching a common approach, Jeremy 
Corbyn said he had not yet seen anything new that would persuade him to support it.
This comes at the start of what is likely to be another torrid week for the prime minister with the Conservatives 
braced for a thrashing at the hands of Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in the European elections on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Conservative members of Parliament have begun to throw their hats in the ring for May's job as she 
prepares to set out her own departure plan. 
Health Secretary Matt Hancock refused to rule out a bid for the job, saying he had a "strong view about the sort of 
leader we need". Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has already confirmed he will stand in the race to replace 
May, which is due to officially begin within weeks.
The prime minister will set out the timetable for her exit and the leadership contest to succeed her after her Brexit 
deal goes to the Commons for a fourth time in early June.
The euro stood at USD1.1169 at the European equities close Monday, against USD1.1160 at the same time on 
Friday.
Stocks in New York were trading in the red at the London equities close, with the DJIA down 0.3%, the S&P 500 
index down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite down 1.2%. 
In London, travel firms ended the session among the worst performers after a disappointing outlook from Irish 
airline Ryanair, as the firm warned it has "zero" visibility on the second half. 
Ryanair closed down 4.6%.
The budget flier reported a 41% fall in annual profit to EUR948.1 million despite revenue rising 6% to EUR7.15 
billion.
LONDON MARKET CLOSE: Huawei Blow And Ryanair Woe Puts Pressure On FTSE
Looking ahead, the airline expects traffic to rise 8% in its recently-begun financial year to 153 million passengers. 
However, assuming revenue per passenger growth of 3%, Ryanair guided for broadly flat group profit. 
This will range from EUR750 million if revenue per passenger rises 2%, up to EUR950 million if revenue per 
passenger rises 4%. 
"While first half bookings are slightly ahead of last year, fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue 
through summer 2019. We have zero second half visibility," the company added.
Ryanair's results hit other travel stocks in a negative read-across, with FTSE 100 members TUI and easyJet 
shedding 6.2% and 3.5% respectively, while Wizz Air in the FTSE 250 declined 2.0%. 
Travel agent Thomas Cook came close to 2011's record low of 8.11 pence, finishing the session down 13% at 
10.25p as it extended last week's losses. 
In morning trade on Monday, the stock hit 8.33p per share. 
Last week, Thomas Cook posted an underlying loss before interest and tax loss of GBP245 million versus a loss of 
GBP170 million a year ago. Looking ahead, the firm said it now expects underlying Ebit in the second half to be 
behind the same period a year ago due to margin pressure.
Following the results, Citigroup cut the stock to Sell from Neutral and wiped its price target to 0p.
Back in the FTSE 100, Land Securities fell 1.6% after Liberum cut the property investor and developer to Hold from 
Buy.
A ratings downgrade saw Merlin Entertainments end as the biggest loser in the FTSE 250, sinking 6.7% after HSBC 
cut the Thorpe Park operator to Reduce from Buy. 
Elsewhere on the Main Market, Low & Bonar sank 24% on the impending departure of its chief executive and news 
that its performance in the first half of its financial year will be "materially behind" a year before.
Philip de Klerk will step down as CEO on July 1 and the company will promote Non-Executive Chair Daniel Dayan 
to executive chair on July 2. The company does not plan to seek a new CEO straight away, but will review the 
situation "later in the year".
The performance materials firm also said it has made a slower recovery than expected in its second quarter, which 
ends May 31. This was attributed to continued market weakness and "the slow recovery of customer confidence" 
within its Coated Technical Textiles unit, which creates modified fabrics for outdoor use.
In the UK corporate calendar on Tuesday, there are annual results from electronics product distributor 
Electrocomponents, car parts and bike retailer Halfords, emergency repairs firm Homeserve and food producer 
Cranswick.
There are third-quarter results from books and stationery retailer WH Smith and a trading statement from gold miner 
Fresnillo. 
In commodities, gold was quoted at USD1,276.80 an ounce at the London equities close Monday against 
USD1,275.10 at the close on Friday.
Brent oil, meanwhile, was quoted at USD72.56 a barrel at the London equities close Monday from USD72.60 late 
Friday.

----------
TUI, down 2.7%, easyJet, down 1.7%, International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 1.2%. The travel stocks 
were lower following disappointing annual results from Ryanair Holdings. The Irish carrier reported a significant fall

3.8%. 
----------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS

quarter, up 10% year-on-year, with revenue rising 6% to GBP196.0 million. It lowered its expectations for the full 
year as a result. The strock remains down 24% so far in 2019.

OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Frontier Smart Technologies Group, up 71% at 25.25p. The audio and smart home software systems producer said 
it failed to reach an agreement with Science Group in respect of a takeover offer for Frontier. At the beginning of 
May, Frontier received a proposal from Science Group for a possible takeover offer at 30p per share. Frontier said it 
"remains focussed on its strategy" and reconfirmed expectations to report sales of approximately USD36.6 million. 
Furthermore, Frontier added that between May 9 and 17, Science Group acquired 3.7 million shares, or 9.0% of the 
company's capital. Science Group, a science and technology consultancy, separately noted that the average price 
paid for the shares was 12.50 pence for a total investment of GBP460,691. Science Group was up 1.3% at 
205.70p.
----------
Echo Energy, up 20%. The oil and gas company announced a switch in focus in Argentina as well as a new chief 
executive. Echo has agreed to a new relationship with Argentina partner Compania General de Combustibles, 
which will see the two focus on Echo's Tapi Aike licence. Echo will now hold 19% of the licence and pay 19% of 
costs, "significantly" lowering the company's obligations. CGC will release USD2.1 million of cash earmarked for the 
Fraccion C, Fraccion D, and Laguna Los Capones assets to go to Tapi Aike. On the management front, Echo 
announced the promotion of Martin Hull as chief executive with immediate effect. He replaces Fiona MacAulay, who

executive and said its performance in the first half of its financial year will be "materially behind" the year before. 
Philip de Klerk will step down as CEO on July 1 and the company will move Non-Executive Chair Daniel Dayan to 
executive chair on July 2. The company does not plan to seek a new CEO straight away, but will review the 
situation "later in the year". The company said its leadership change stemmed from a need to accelerate its 
transformation programme, which began in late 2018. The firm also said it has made a slower recovery than 
expected in its second quarter, which ends May 31. This was attributed to continued market weakness and "the 
slow recovery of customer confidence" within its Coated Technical Textiles unit, which creates modified fabrics for 
outdoor use.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened mixed on Monday, with oil majors among the best 
performers in the FTSE 100 on a firm oil price and rising tensions between the US and Iran, while airlines fell after 
Ryanair reported a drop in annual profit. 
The FTSE 100 was up 7.30 points, or 0.1%, at 7,355.92. The FTSE 250 was down 19.71 points, or 0.1% at 
19,478.90. The AIM All-Share was up 0.1% at 960.10.
The Cboe UK 100 index was up 0.1% at 12,475.79. The Cboe UK 250 was down 0.1% at 17,503.40, and the Cboe 
UK Small Companies was flat at 11,850.56.
In European equities, the CAC 40 in Paris was down 0.2% and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt was down 0.1%. 
In the FTSE 100, oil majors were the best performer, tracking spot oil prices higher, quoted at USD73.20 Monday, 
up from USD72.60 at the London equities close Friday.
Royal Dutch Shell 'A' and 'B' shares were both up 0.7% and BP was up 0.6%. Shell is London's biggest company 
by market capitalisation, while BP is third.
Oil prices were higher after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih indicated there was consensus among OPEC and 
allied oil producers to continue limiting supplies.
LONDON MARKET OPEN: Oil Stocks Lift FTSE 100; Ryanair Grounds Airlines
London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler commented: "Oil has already rallied around 40% since the start of the year, 
thanks mainly to OPEC limiting supply. Investors had been growing nervous that OPEC could look to remove the 
production limits at its next meeting in June, in light of tightening global supply and elevated prices. 
"Whilst the OPEC production cuts have offered significant support to oil prices, US sanctions on Iran and 
Venezuela have also played a role. Add into the equation rising Middle Eastern tensions, as Iran retaliates to US 
measures and oil looks well supported at these levels."
At the other end of the large cap index, airline stocks were the worst performers following disappointing annual 
results from Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings. 
Ryanair shares were down 6.4%. easyJet was down 2.5% and British Airways-parent International Consolidated 
Airlines Group was down 1.5%.
Ryanair reported a significant fall in annual profit due to increased fuel, airport and staff costs, and it said it has 
"zero" visibility on its likely results beyond the first half of the current year.
For the financial year ended March 31, the Irish budget airline reported pretax profit of EUR948.1 million, down 41% 
from EUR1.61 billion the year prior. This included a pretax loss of EUR182.7 million at Lauda, Ryanair's Austrian 
airline established by former Formula 1 champion Niki Lauda and acquired by Ryanair in December.
Fuel & oil costs rose 23% to EUR2.42 billion from EUR1.90 billion, staff costs increased 28% to EUR945.0 million 
from EUR738.5 million, and airport charges rose 9% to EUR1.02 billion from EUR938.6 million, hurting profit.
In the FTSE 250, Aston Martin Lagonda was the best performer, up 4.6% after Bernstein raised the luxury sports 
car maker to Outperform from Market Perform. 
At the other end of the midcap index, Merlin Entertainments was the worst performer, down 4.8% after HSBC 
downgraded the amusement park and attractions operator to Reduce from Buy. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.2%. In China, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.9%, while the 
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is down 0.7%
Japan's gross domestic product climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.5% on quarter in the first quarter of 2019, the 
Cabinet Office said in Monday's preliminary reading.
That beat forecasts for a fall 0.1% and was up from the downwardly revised 0.4% gain in the three months prior, 
which was originally reported as 0.5%. On an annualized yearly basis, GDP was up 2.1% - again exceeding 
expectations for a fall of 0.2% following the downwardly revised 1.6% gain in the previous three months - originally 
1.9%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.2732 Monday, flat against USD1.2737 at the London equities close Friday.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is set to begin discussions with senior ministers on her proposed new "bold offer" 
to members of Parliament in a final attempt to get her Brexit deal through Parliament.

However, there was widespread scepticism at Westminster that it will fare any better than her three previous failed 
attempts to get the Commons to pass the deal.

Following the collapse last week of cross-party talks with Labour aimed at reaching a common approach, opposition 
leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had not yet seen anything new that would persuade him to support it.
"Politics will continue to hog the lime-light in the UK in the coming week, although all indications now are that 
Theresa May will eschew the series of indicative Brexit votes in Parliament that was at one stage mooted for the 
first half of this week. With the next key Brexit event now likely to be the 'second reading' vote on May's Withdrawal 
Agreement Bill in the week commencing 3 June, all eyes this week will be on the European Parliament election on 
Thursday, which looks set to see May's Conservatives humiliated," said analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets. 
The economic events calendar on Monday has eurozone current account numbers at 1000 BST.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in low-cost airline easyJet PLC rose on Friday as it kept annual expectations 
unchanged despite posting a sharp widening to its interim loss.
easyJet shares were trading up 3.6% on Friday, with the stock toppling the FTSE 100 index. 
The airline said it saw high-single-digit revenue growth in the first half of its current financial year but loss widened, 
in line with forecasts, due to an increase in fuel costs. 
"Budget airline easyJet becomes the latest travel stock to post a big loss as it reports first half results, but its shares 
are taking off regardless," AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.
He added: "This is reward for the tight control of costs which means despite lower revenue per seat, full year profit 
guidance is unchanged.
"These results were always likely to compare unfavourably with last year's which benefited from scheduling 
problems at main rival Ryanair and the collapse of Monarch Airlines. It is a tough time to be an airline in general 
with rising labour costs, excess capacity and spiralling fuel costs, not to mention the growing pressure on the whole 
concept of flying from environmental campaigners."
Mould concluded: "Against this stormy backdrop, easyJet perhaps has a clearer flight path than some of its peer 
group."
In the six months to March 31, easyJet's pretax loss came in at GBP272 million compared to GBP68 million 
reported for the same period a year earlier.
Fuel cost per seat jumped 14% in the period to GBP13.02 from GBP11.42 the year before, driven by a rise in oil 
prices.
EXTRA: easyJet Shares Take Off Despite Widened Interim Loss
easyJet's total fuel costs increased 31% in the first half to GBP602 million from GBP461 million the year prior. As a 
result, the airline's headline cost per seat increased 3.9% to GBP56.66 from GBP54.53.
Nevertheless, the company's revenue increased 7.3% to GBP2.34 billion from GBP2.18 billion the year before. 
Total revenue per seat, however, was down by 6.3% to GBP50.71 from GBP54.10. 
"easyJet has performed in line with expectations in the first half. I am pleased that despite tougher trading 
conditions, we flew more than 41 million customers, performed well operationally, with 54% fewer cancellations in 
the period and customer satisfaction with our crew is at an all-time high," said Chief Executive Johan Lundgren.  
The total revenue increase was attributed to a growth in capacity, which rose 14% year-on-year to 46.2 million, and 
a foreign exchange benefits. 
Load factor, a key measure for airlines, came in at 90.1%, down from 91.1% the year before. 
However, the company noted that its revenue was negatively impacted by the move of the Easter holiday and 
change to the IFRS 15 accounting standard.
In addition, easyJet said the issues at Gatwick Airport over Christmas caused by an errant drone cost it GBP5 
million in revenue. 
The airline said it had received one-off benefits in the corresponding period a year ago due to the bankruptcy of 
Monarch and Ryanair Holdings PLC "cancelling a large proportion of its winter 2017/8 schedule in the UK". 
Nonetheless, easyJet kept its full-year headline pretax profit expectations unchanged and in line with markets 
expectations. 
Forward bookings for the third quarter are expected to be three percentage points behind last year at 72% and flat 
year-on-year at 34% for the fourth quarter. easyJet's capacity growth in the second half is forecast at about 7%.
Revenue per seat, at constant currency, is expected to be "slightly down" in financial 2019, hurt by the "ongoing 
negative impact" of Brexit as well as a "wider macroeconomic slowdown" in Europe.  
The airline said it was prepared for the UK to leave the EU on March 29, and has 135 aircraft registered in Australia 
and is flying that fleet independently.
Full year headline cost per seat, excluding fuel at constant currency, is also expected to be down.
Meanwhile, reflecting the increase in revenue, and in line with its dividend policy, the airline hiked its interim payout 
43% to 58.6 pence from 40.9p the year before.
"Cost control remains a major priority for easyJet. Our focus is on efficiency and on innovation through data and we 
are on track to deliver more than GPB100 million in cost savings during 2019," said Lundgren. 
easyJet said it most of its savings in the first half came from the reduction in disruption events, which totalled 3,242 
compared to 4,815 a year prior. 
Lundgren added: "We have invested in the operation by doubling our standby aircraft and changed our schedules 
so that even though the external operating environment over the summer is not set to improve, we plan to alleviate 
the impact on our customers."

Ryanair Recognizes Strikes As Reason For German Passenger Compensation
Ryanair Recognizes Strikes As Reason For German Passenger 
Compensation

HAMBURG (Alliance News) - Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC has paid damages to individual 
passengers whose flights did not reach their destinations on time due to strikes, a Hamburg court said Monday.
In at least five legal proceedings, Ryanair recognized the demands of the plaintiff, a Hamburg court spokesman 
said.
Ryanair declined to comment on the proceedings.
Ryanair has previously refused to compensate passengers whose flights were cancelled due to strikes by Ryanair 
staff.
Under EU legislation for flight cancellations, an airline should pay EUR250 to each passenger, unless they are 
informed at least two weeks in advance or are offered alternative flights arriving at their destination the same day.
An airline can withhold compensation if it can show that the cancellation is "caused by extraordinary circumstances 
which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken," according to the rules.
Last year, Ryanair argued that no compensation is payable "when the union is acting unreasonably and totally 
beyond the airline's control."
Air travel legal service provider Flightright, which has submitted lawsuits on behalf of hundreds of clients, disagrees, 
saying the company has provoked strikes with years of low wages and could have avoided an escalation of the 
labour action.
Flightright legal expert Oskar de Felice said the airline's behaviour was tactical, saying Ryanair wants to prevent the 
Hamburg court from pushing the issue on to the European Court of Justice.

COLOGNE (Alliance News) - Deutsche Lufthansa AG Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr on Tuesday said the 
company has expressed its interest in the acquisition of the Condor holiday airline from the UK's Thomas Cook 
Group PLC. 
Speaking at the German air carrier's general meeting, Spohr said Lufthansa has officially conveyed a non-binding 
offer to Thomas Cook. 
Thomas Cook, with air operations in the UK, Scandinavia, Germany and Spain, has been troubled with financial 
concerns. Last week, the UK company said it has maintained a "healthy level of liquidity headroom" over the slower 
winter months and has kept its liquidity buffer on target.
The first deadline for the expressions of interest in Condor is on Tuesday. Wizz Air Holidings PLC, Ryanair Holdings 
PLC, easyJet PLC, and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA all reportedly have 
done so.
Spohr said Lufthansa is of the view that the acquisition of the long-haul route to tourist destinations from Frankfurt 
and Munich could be attractive.

CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Sainsbury Results Cheer After M&A Woe
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Sainsbury Results Cheer After 
M&A Woe

LONDON (Alliance News) - Earnings were in focus over the past week in the consumer services sector, with J 
Sainsbury posting some good figures following its failed merger with Asda the week prior and Whitbread issuing its 
first annual results since selling its Costa Coffee chain to Coca-Cola.
Grocer Sainsbury's on Wednesday reported a 42% drop in pretax profit for the 52 weeks to March 9, not helped by 
almost GBP400 million of extra charges related to the aborted Asda merger, pension costs, and an overhaul of its 
banking platform. 
Revenue was up, though, by 1.9%, and underlying pretax profit beat expectations. Sainsbury's returned 11 pence 
to shareholders, up 7.8% year-on-year and ahead of consensus. 
The announcement came a day after Kantar said the UK's grocery sector picked up some pace in the 12 weeks to 
April 21, boosted by Easter spending, with Sainsbury's reclaiming second place from Asda in terms of market 
share. 
Turning to non-food retail, clothing and homewares chain Next on Wednesday beat its own sales expectations 
thanks to warmer weather at the end of April.
Sales in the thirteen weeks April 27 climbed 4.5%, ahead of expectations of a 3.2% rise, though Next did warn not 
to expect similar performance in the rest of the year. 
Fashion and homeware retailer N Brown on Thursday sunk to an annual loss after a profit, due to almost GBP150 
million of exceptional charges, treble a year prior.

Revenue was broadly flat, with the Jacamo-owner saying performance was "solid" in the 52 weeks to March 2. 
However, it cut its annual dividend 50%, to 7.1p. 
Looking at the wider UK retail sphere, on Friday research firm BDO said good weather, the school holidays, and a 
late Easter failed to soothe the UK's suffering high streets.
High street retail sales fell 0.4% in April, BDO said, the third month of decline in 2019 already, while there has been 
next to no growth over the past 15 months. 
On Wednesday, shop price inflation was shown to have fallen to 0.4% in April from 0.9% in March by the BRC-
Nielsen Shop Price Index. The slowdown was caused by a more than doubling of the number of discounted 
products as retailers try to boost sales. 
There was also an initial public offering announced in the retail sector, with luxury retailer Watches of Switzerland 
announcing a plan to float in London.
The firm, which sells top watch brands such as Rolex, Tag Heuer, Omega, and Patek Philippe, did not provide 
many details, but did say it would offer both new shares and allow existing shareholders - primarily investment 
funds managed by an affiliate of Apollo Global Management - to sell theirs. 
On Thursday, budget airline Ryanair reported a 10% rise in April passenger numbers, including Austrian airline 
Lauda, reaching 13.0 million. 
On the same day, central and eastern Europe-focused peer Wizz Air posted 19% traffic growth, with passenger 
numbers reaching 3.3 million. 
Outside of the UK, German airline Lufthansa on Tuesday posted a significantly widened first quarter net loss, 
reaching EUR342 million from just EUR39 million a year prior. 
Lufthansa blamed the wider loss on a sharp rise in fuel costs and a deterioration in unit revenue in Europe. Overall 
revenue rose 3% to EUR7.89 billion. 
A week-long strike by SAS pilots ended on Thursday, though not before the Scandinavian airline had to cancel 
4,000 flights. 
The labour action was over concerns about scheduling, job security, and salaries, and affected around 380,000 
passengers. 
Moving into hospitality, Intercontinental Hotels Group on Friday reported subdued revenue per available room 
growth, rising 0.3% in the first quarter.
In the Americas, the figure rose 0.8%, with performance strong in the US, Mexico, and Colombia. 
Premier Inn-owner Whitbread on Tuesday posted a steep drop, 39%, in pretax profit for its year ended February 28, 
though it did rise 1.2% underlying. 
Whitbread booked GBP178 million in extra costs, much of which were due to its sale of Costa Coffee to Coca-Cola. 
Whitbread cut its annual dividend to 99.65p from 101.15p a year prior, and it also warned on weak revenue per 
room in the UK going forward. 
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Sainsbury Results Cheer After M&A Woe
Moving to restaurants, brewer and pub owner Greene King on Tuesday guided for a rise in profit in its recently 
ended year, following solid sales growth.
Greene King said sales rose 2.9% ahead of the UK pub market for its year ended April 29, with trading over Easter 
strong. Profit before tax and exceptional items for the year to be in the range of GBP244 million and GBP247 
million, slightly ahead year-on-year.
On the same day, fast-food firm McDonald's said it had a strong start to 2019, despite a slight decline in net income 
and revenue.
Revenue fell 3.6% in the first quarter of 2019 due to refranchising, while net income dipped 3.4%.

15% in the past 12 month to 37.8 million.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following stocks are the leading risers and fallers within the main London indices 
on Tuesday.
----------
FTSE 100 - WINNERS
----------
Royal Dutch Shell 'A', up 2.5%, Shell 'B', up 2.2%, BP, up 2.2%. The oil majors were tracking spot oil prices higher, 
quoted at USD74.53 a barrel Tuesday, up from USD71.70 at the London equities close Thursday. Oil prices were 
higher after the US on Monday said it will not extend waivers to eight countries that have been allowed to buy oil 
from Iran despite US sanctions that went into effect in November. The move is "intended to bring Iran's oil exports 
to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue," according to the White House. In the FTSE 250, oil 
stocks Cairn Energy, Premier Oil and Tullow Oil were up 6.5%, 6.4% and 6.3% respectively. 
----------
Centrica, up 1.4%. The 'Big Six' energy provider plans to expand its software business, to cash in on increased 
demand for more flexible grid systems, the Financial Times reported on Monday. According to Jorge Pikunic, 
Centrica's managing director of Distributed Energy & Power, Centrica is looking to expand the segment's operations 
over the next three years by "almost fivefold". The group will look to grow the business into a software supplier to 
other companies, amid plans to increase the amount of renewable energy that currently makes up the UK's 
electricity supply.
----------
FTSE 100 - LOSERS
----------
easyJet, down 3.9%, International Consolidated Airlines Group, down 2.8%. The airline stocks were lower following 
the rise in the oil price. Higher oil prices result in increased fuel costs for airline operators. In the FTSE 250, Wizz 
Air was down 2.7%, while Irish carrier Ryanair Holdings was off 3.3%. "Airline stocks are also under pressure as 
news unfolds that French pilots may walk out in protest in May over a change in legislation. The strike has the

potential to disrupt Air France and easyJet flights to and from France in May and comes at a time when airlines are 
beginning to feel the pinch of higher oil prices," said City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta. 
----------
FTSE 250 - WINNERS
----------
Travis Perkins, up 3.0%. Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised the builders' merchant to Buy from Neutral. 
----------
OTHER MAIN MARKET AND AIM - WINNERS
----------
Tekcapital, up 65%. The intellectual property investor said its portfolio company has launched a low-sodium salt 
under the name MicroSalt. The portfolio company, Salarius, develops and manufactures MicroSalt - salt crystals 
that are around 100 times smaller than table salt. These smaller grains produce a more powerful flavour, which 
means less sodium is consumed overall. In addition to the MicroSalt launch, Salarius has "secured its first customer 
to incorporate MicroSalt in their snack food business". The customer, whose name was not disclosed, is a US 
snack food maker, and the MicroSalt will be dispatched to it in May. Tekcapital owns a 97.5% stake in Salarius.
----------
Thomas Cook Group, up 17%. The travel agent's shares were higher after Sky News reported on Saturday that the 
company is in talks over a possible takeover. Sky said it learned that Thomas Cook has "brought in advisers from 
AlixPartners to work on its balance sheet and cost reduction plans, while its syndicate of more than a dozen lenders 
has hired FTI Consulting to advise on their financial exposure to Thomas Cook". Fosun, a Chinese company and 
Thomas Cook's largest shareholder, is reported to be "among those which have lodged a preliminary interest" in 
buying Thomas Cook's tour operating business. According to Sky: "Analysts also cited EQT and KKR, the two 
private equity firms which own Kuoni Group and Travelopia respectively, as logical bidders for the London-listed 
travel company".

EU Court Dismisses Lufthansa Action On Subsidy For German Airport

LUXEMBOURG (Alliance News) - An EU court on Friday dismissed a legal action by German airline Deutsche 
Lufthansa AG that contested subsidies to Frankfurt-Hahn Airport and contracts it entered into with Dublin-based 
budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC.
Lufthansa, which does not use the airport, had failed to show that its business had been negatively affected enough 
to justify its complaint, the EU's General Court ruled.
At issue are subsidies worth millions of euros paid out in previous years. Lufthansa - Europe's largest airline if all its 
subsidiaries are included - alleged unfair competition.
It challenged a 2014 decision by the European Commission to approve the subsidies, on the basis that they were 
not in breach of EU competition rules.
Hahn lies some 120 kilometres from Frankfurt, where Lufthansa has its main hub.
The 2014 decision allowed payments to Hahn airport by Fraport, which operated both Hahn and Frankfurt Airport at 
the time, as well as two German states.
Of the three, only one of the German states - Hesse - still holds a minority share in Hahn. In 2017, China's HNA 
took over 82.5% of the airport.
The commission decided in 2014 that the support for Hahn airport was either not state subsidies or was compliant 
with EU subsidy rules.
Lufthansa said it would consider whether to challenge the decision before the European Court of Justice, the bloc's 
top tribunal.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Airlines were in the spotlight this week after easyJet guided for a "significantly" widened 
interim loss and Wizz Air said its annual profit will land at the upper end of guidance. 
easyJet started off the week on Monday saying that macroeconomic and Brexit uncertainty would lead to a softer 
second half and a significantly widened interim loss.
For the six months to March-end, easyJet expects to report a headline pretax loss of around GBP275 million due to 
higher costs, fuel and foreign exchange charges. This compares to a headline loss of GBP18 million a year ago.
First-half revenue however is expected to rise 7.3% to GBP2.34 billion.
Looking ahead, the budget airline warned that the second half outlook is now even "more cautious" due to 
macroeconomic uncertainty leading to softness in both the UK and Europe.
Brexit uncertainty did not seem to affect smaller peer Wizz Air however, which on Tuesday reported further traffic 
growth in March and said annual profit would come in towards the top of its guidance.
The central and eastern Europe-focused airline said net profit for the year ended March 31 is expected to come in 
towards the upper half of the EUR270 million and EUR300 million guidance range. A year ago, Wizz Air's net profit 
amounted to EUR275 million.
This was after fourth quarter trading in line with expectations and "robust" demand across the company's key 
geographical territories, Wizz Air explained.

In March, Wizz Air passenger numbers rose 9.9% to 2.7 million. On a rolling 12 months basis, passenger numbers 
increased 17% to 34.6 million.
Meanwhile, another airline heavyweight, Ryanair Holdings, said March passenger numbers rose 9.0% to 10.9 
million. On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair's traffic was also up 9.0% to 142.1 million. 
Elsewhere, trouble continued across the retail sector with data released Friday suggesting that Mother's Day and 
warm spring weather failed to provide respite for the struggling UK high street in March.
A mere 4.8% rise in sales failed to counterbalance last March's dire 10% fall, the BDO's High Street Sales Tracker 
showed.
The latest figures closed a "disastrous" first quarter for the high street, BDO said.
Meanwhile, UK shop prices continued to rise in March, the British Retail Consortium-Nielsen Shop Price Index 
showed on Wednesday, with annual shop price inflation accelerating to 0.9% from 0.7% in February, marking the 
highest inflation rate since 2013.
Some retailers have continued to take advantage of the tough trading climate by hunting for cut-price deals.
FTSE 250 retailer JD Sports Fashion on Thursday bought Oasis singer Liam Gallagher's clothing brand Pretty 
Green out of administration for an undisclosed sum. 
JD Sports will keep the flagship store in Manchester open, but will shut down 11 other stores and 33 concessions, 
putting 97 jobs at risk.
Additionally, last month JD agreed to acquire shoe retailer Footasylum for GBP90.1 million.
Also looking to snap up businesses, Sports Direct International offered to acquire home shopping retailer Findel for 
GBP139.2 million. 
Findel however urged its shareholders to reject Sports Direct proposed takeover as it believes the offer 
"undervalues" the business.
On Monday, Findel received a letter from its second largest shareholder, Schroders Investment Management, 
supporting the company in its rejection of the offer.
Sports Direct's pursuit of taking over struggling department store chain operator Debenhams also continued with 
Sports Direct saying Monday that it has been contacted by a number of Debenhams' shareholders expressing 
support for the sports retailer's board requisition action. 
Sports Direct said Debenhams shareholders expressed concern regarding the protection of their own interests amid 
a refinancing of Debenhams and stated their support for the appointment of Sports Direct's boss Mike Ashley to 
Debenhams board as chief executive.
In March, Sports Direct called for a general meeting of Debenhams to propose Ashley's appointment to the board to 
carry out an executive role. Furthermore, Sports Direct is looking to oust all Debenhams directors bar one.
In a separate attempt to take control of Debenhams, Sports Direct has made a GBP61.4 million bid for the 
department store chain.

Women fashion retailer Bonmarche on Tuesday also found itself as the object of a takeover offer by Spectre 
Holdings Ltd, owned by Edinburgh Woollen Mill billionaire owner Philip Day.
The offer is priced at 11.445 pence per share and values the company at GBP5.7 million, a 34% discount to 
Bonmarche's GBP8.7 million market value Monday's close. 
Meanwhile, on Tuesday Superdry's co-founder and former chief executive Julian Dunkerton narrowly won a 
shareholder vote marking his return to the company's board. 
Superdry's shareholders voted in favour of two special resolutions proposed by the retailer's co-founders, which 
resulted in Dunkerton's reappointment and the appointment of Boohoo group's Peter Williams as director.
As a result of the votes, Superdry's Chair Peter Bamford, Chief Executive Euan Sutherland and Chief Financial 
Officer Ed Barker have stepped down with immediate effect, while Non-Executive Directors Dennis Millard, Minnow 
Powell, Sarah Wood and John Smith will leave their roles on July 1.
Finally, the Food retail sector saw Asda kicking out J Sainsbury taking the spot of the second biggest UK 
supermarket by market share, according to figures released by Kantar on Tuesday. 
Asda, in the 12 weeks to March 24, saw sales up by a miniscule 0.1% but reached market share of 15.4%. Over the 
same period, Sainsbury's sales dropped 1.8%, with market share down to 15.3%. 
Wm Morrison Supermarkets was the only other grocer seeing a decline in sales, dipping 0.1%, with its market share 
at 10.3%. Tesco saw sales up 0.5%, but its market share shed 0.2 percentage point to 27.4%. 
Overall, UK supermarkets saw sales up 1.4% year-on-year, the slowest rate in a year due to the later timing of 
Easter and Mother's Day.
A strong performance from its Food division helped Co-operative Group increasing annual pretax profit by 27% to 
GBP93 million. Revenue rose 14% to GBP10.2 billion the company said Friday. 
On Wednesday next week, UK biggest supermarket Tesco is out with its annual results. The grocer is expected to 
show a 22% surge in pretax profit to GBP1.6 billion.
On the same day, another retail heavyweight ASOS will publish its interim results with analysts forecasting a drop in 
profit to GBP3.5 million from GBP27.3 million a year ago.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Tuesday said its traffic grew in March, 
while smaller peer Wizz Air Holdings PLC experienced an even sharper rise.
Ryanair said March passenger numbers rose 9.0% to 10.9 million. On a rolling annual basis Ryanair's traffic was 
also up 9.0% to 142.1 million. 
The airline's load factor stood at 96% both in March and over the 12-month rolling period. 
Furthermore, Ryanair said its pilots based in Portugal voted in favour of a collective labour agreement governing 
pay and conditions for the next four years.
The agreement was negotiated between the airline and the Portuguese pilot union, SPAC, and covers all of 
Ryanair's directly employed pilots in Portugal.
Meanwhile, central and eastern Europe-focused airline Wizz Air Holdings PLC reported further traffic growth in 
March, as it said it expects its annual profit to come in towards the top of its guidance.
For the month of March, Wizz Air reported a 9.9% rise in passenger numbers to 2.7 million, while the increase was 
even greater, up 17% to 34.6 million, on a rolling 12 months basis. 
The company increased its capacity - the number of available seats - by 6.9% in March to 2.9 million and by 15% in 
the past 12 month to 37.3 million.
Load factor in March rose 2.6 percentage points to 94.1%. It was up 1.4 percentage point to 92.8% over the past 
year.
Wizz Air said it expects its annual net profit for the year ended March to come in towards the upper half of its 
guidance range of between EUR270 million and EUR300 million. A year ago, Wizz Air's net profit amounted to 
EUR275 million.
TOP NEWS: Ryanair Traffic Grows, Wizz Air Profit To Top Guidance
This was after fourth quarter trading in line with expectations and "robust" demand across the company's key 
geographical territories, Wizz Air explained. 
Wizz Air said it experienced an "excellent operational performance" in March with only one cancelled flight 
compared to 68 in March 2018. During the month, the airline expanded adding 15 new routes to  and from Poland, 
Romania, UK, Ukraine, Serbia and Moldova. 
Looking ahead, Wizz Air said it started the new year well, forecasting a 4.0% increase in revenue per available seat 
per kilometre in the first quarter. 
Wizz Air will report its annual results on May 31.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening higher on Tuesday following a strong close in 
the US overnight and gains in Asian equity markets, as investors reacted positively to US and Chinese 
manufacturing data released on Monday.
In company news, the spat between Provident Financial and Non-Standard Finance took another twist, BHP is 
lowering its iron ore guidance, Ryanair and Wizz Air issued upbeat trading statements, and womenswear retailer 
Bonmarche received a discounted takeover offer.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open up 15.02 points at 7,332.40. The blue-chip index closed up 38.19 
points, or 0.5%, at 7,317.38 on Monday.
Provident Financial said Chief Financial Officer Simon Thomas is to take up to three months leave starting on 
Friday to have a heart operation. Thomas is expected to return to work full time no later than June. The subprime 
lender said Tony Skrzypecki is to be interim CFO.
Provident Financial has been embroiled in a hostile takeover battle with John van Kuffeler's Non-Standard Finance, 
with the two companies trading barbs over the past few months. Van Kuffeler was CEO of Provident between 1991 
to 2013.
Non-Standard Finance said it has received bid acceptances from over 50% of Provident shareholders, but added 
that 90% of acceptances is required for success. 
In response, Provident reiterated its rejection of the Non-Standard Finance offer and said it continues to explore 
alternatives to maximise shareholder value.

Ryanair Holdings reported an increase in traffic for the month of March, with passenger numbers up 9% to 10.9 
million. On a rolling annual basis Ryanair's traffic was up 9% to 142.1 million. 
Smaller budget airline Wizz Air Holdings said it expects its annual profit to come in towards the top of its guidance, 
while also reporting traffic growth in March. 
Wizz Air Holdings said trading in the fourth quarter of its financial year ended on Sunday is in line with expectations. 
The central and eastern Europe-focused airline expects to deliver a net annual profit for the year in the upper half of 
its guidance range of between EUR270 million and EUR300 million. 
HSBC took a downbeat view of the airline sector, downgrading its ratings on easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air to Hold 
from Buy. 
Irish building materials firm CRH said it completed the fourth phase of its share buyback programme, returning a 
further EUR200 million of cash to shareholders. The company added that this brings total cash returned to 
shareholders under our share buyback programme to approximately EUR1 billion over the last 12 months.
CRH added that further share buybacks are "under active consideration".
Construction firm Galliford Try said it signed an agreement with Homes England to build more than 850 homes 
across the UK.
The housebuilder said the partnership will deliver housing across key sites in Redcar, Cheshire, Staffordshire and 
Dorset. The homes will be constructed as part of Homes England's initiative to build new housing at pace. 
Construction work will begin on the projects immediately with the first planning applications due to be submitted 
later in April and the first homes expected to be completed in spring 2020.
Miner BHP Group will be reviewing its 2019 production guidance following disruption caused by Cyclone Veronica 
in Australia.
The storm has not caused any major damage at Port Hedland in Western Australia, BHP said, but flooding has 
hampered the movement of trains. As a result, Port Hedland, part of BHP's iron ore arm, is operating at a reduced 
rate and will continue to do so until later in April.
BHP said an early estimate of the impact will see 2019 production fall by around 6 million to 8 million tonnes, and it 
is also reviewing unit cost guidance. A further update will be provided after further work is carried out, it said.
Spectre Holdings, a Dubai-registered company 100% owned by Edinburgh Woolen Mill owner Philip Day, has made 
a mandatory cash offer for clothing retailer Bonmarche after taking a 52.4% stake. The offer values Bonmarche at 
GBP5.7 million, against its GBP8.7 million current market value. Spectre pointed to a significant decline in 
Bonmarche's profitability and said it could offer advice and support.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index ended flat. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.7%, while the Hang Seng 
index in Hong Kong is up 0.2%.
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite 
both up 1.3%, while the S&P 500 ended 1.2% higher.
"Rebounding US manufacturing helped US shares advance at the start of the new quarter. The S&P 500 surged to 
its highest level since October while stocks across Asia also rallied on Tuesday, setting European indices up for a 
positive start," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler.

On Monday, a report from the Institute for Supply Management unexpectedly showing a faster rate of growth in US 
manufacturing activity in the month of March.
Additionally on Monday, data showed Chinese manufacturing activity unexpectedly grew for the first time in four 
months in March. A private survey also showed the manufacturing sector in the world's second-biggest economy 
returning to expansion.
"Traders are growing increasingly optimistic that the world's two largest economies are starting to stabilise, amid 
better recent data prints," Lawler said.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3065 early Tuesday, down from USD1.3118 at the London equities close Monday.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will seek to break the Brexit deadlock as she gathers her Cabinet for a marathon 
session of crisis talks in Downing Street.
The prime minister and her senior ministers will take stock after members of Parliament again failed to find a 
majority for a series of alternatives to her Brexit deal.
A call for a customs union with the EU was rejected by just three votes, while a demand for a second referendum 
was defeated by 12 and a Norway-style deal put forward by Nick Boles by 21.
To cap a dramatic day in the Commons, Boles immediately declared that he would no longer sit as a Conservative 
MP, blaming the party for refusing to compromise on a means of leaving the EU.
Cabinet will meet on Tuesday for five hours to thrash out a way forward.
In Tuesday's economic calendar, the UK's construction PMI is at 0930 BST while eurozone producer prices are at 
1000 BST and US durable goods orders are at 1330 BST.
At 0800 BST, Kantar releases its latest grocery share figures for the 12 weeks ending March 24.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum said it sees as much as a 20% downside risk to consensus forecasts following 
easyJet's downbeat outlook for the second half. 
Shares in the low-cost airline were down 7.6% at 1,033.10 pence on Monday, the worst performer in the FTSE 100 
index. 
For the six months ended March, easyJet expects to report a headline pretax loss of around GBP275 million. This 
compares to a headline loss of GBP18 million a year ago, though it would be an improvement on the GBP299 
million forecast by Liberum.
Most other metrics were in line with management guidance, with a 7.4% decline in revenue per seat at constant 
currency. 
"The outlook is the challenge, with management having less confidence on H2 (summer)," said Liberum. 
Despite the in-line first half, easyJet said it expects revenue per seat at constant currency "slightly up" in the second 
half, reflecting a weakening third quarter demand amid "many unanswered questions" surrounding Brexit.
"Given this uncertainty our outlook for the second half is now more cautious," the airline added.
The guidance assumes a resolution to Brexit uncertainty in the current financial year, Liberum commented, which 
would suggest further downside risk if the political deadlock continues. 
Liberum said it sees at 15% to 20% risks to consensus estimates for the current financial year.
Though UBS did not specify figures, the Swiss bank similarly said it sees "material downside pressure" to forecast 
consensus numbers following the warning. 
IN THE KNOW: Material Risk To easyJet Consensus After Cautious Outlook
The last time easyJet updated the market it seemed cautiously confident, said UBS, so Monday's warning comes 
as a surprise. 
UBS continued to rate the shares at Neutral, holding a 1,310p price target, though the bank sees "material" share 
price pressure. Liberum, meanwhile, kept its Hold rating with a 1,350p price target. 
Other London-listed airlines traded lower on Monday following the warning from easyJet, with British Airways owner 
International Consolidate Airlines down 1.6%, central and eastern Europe-focused Wizz Air down 3.9% and budget 
flier Ryanair down 3.5%.

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC on Friday said it continues to "stand ready" to activate its no-deal Brexit 
contingency plan which will see the suspension of some shareholders' rights. 
The FTSE 100 budget airline said that in the case of a disorderly exit of the UK from the European Union, it will 
suspend the voting rights of a "small number of shares". This will be done to shares held by non-EU shareholders, 
including UK nationals, on a last-in-first-out basis. 
For the period of suspension, the affected shareholders will not be permitted to attend, speak or vote at meeting of 
the company. 
The plan is needed to ensure easyJet's compliance with EU ownership and control requirements, to allow the airline 
to continue flying across the bloc. 
Currently, easyJet's EU ownership, excluding the UK, stands at 49.9%, below the 50% plus 1 share which will be 
required after Brexit to comply with EU rules. 
Earlier in March, airline peer Ryanair Holdings PLC implemented a similar plan among its resolutions to protect the 
company in the case of a no-deal Brexit. 
Ryanair decided that all shares held by non-EU shareholders, including UK ones after Brexit, will be treated as 
"restricted shares", meaning that they will have no entitlement to attend, speak or vote at any company meeting. 
Furthermore, Ryanair added that the prohibition on non-EU nationals to acquire shares, announced in 2002, 
continues to apply.

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC on Monday said it withdrew from the process of forming a consortium for 
the potential acquisition of Italian flag carrier Alitalia Societa Aerea Italiana Spa. 
The budget airline said it took this decision following discussions with Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane and US's 
Delta Air Lines, the other two potential members of the consortium.
Ferrovie dello Stato is a state-owned company that manages the Italian rail network, while Delta is an Atlanta, 
Georgia-based airline. 
"easyJet remains committed to Italy, as a key market for the company, where it currently carries 18.5 million 
passengers every year and employs 1400 pilots and crew, all on local contracts," the budget airline said. 
Back in February, easyJet confirmed talks for the potential acquisition of the beleaguered Italian airline.
At the end of October, easyJet submitted a proposal expressing interest in Alitalia after the Italian government was 
forced to rescue the company in 2017.
Alitalia went into government-controlled administration in 2017 and was kept afloat by Italian state loans worth 
EUR900 million. The Italian government was supposed to recoup the money by December 15, 2018 and wrap up 
bankruptcy procedures; however it decided to extend the loan to June 30, 2019.
Back in June 2018, both easyJet and fellow budget operator Ryanair Holdings PLC expresses interest in acquiring 
Alitalia, with the latter backing out following chaos caused by strikes and flights cancellations.
easyJet already flies to many destinations in Italy, including Rome, Milan and Naples.
easyjet shares were trading down 0.8% at 1,249.00 pence each.

company," it said.

LONDON (Alliance News) - JPMorgan Global Growth & Income PLC on Thursday said it underperformed against 
its benchmark in the first half of its year due to stock selection.
The investment trust posted a net asset value total return for the six months to December of minus 8.6%, lagging 
behind its benchmark - the MSCI All Countries World Index in sterling terms - which had a return of minus 5.7%.
The company's holdings in fashion retailer ASOS PLC, video game firm Electronic Arts Inc, and budget airline 
Ryanair Holdings PLC, were the largest detractors.
The company's NAV declined to 285.6 pence per share on December 31 from 318.4p per share on June 30 and 
323.7p per share year-on-year. 
Shares in JPMorgan Global Growth & Income closed down 0.3% at 306.00 pence on Thursday.
Jeroen Huysinga and Tim Woodhouse, the trust's investment managers, said: "Our high conviction stock picking 
has frequently been a key driver of the company's outperformance of its index, so it is disappointing that stock 
picking was the primary reason for underperformance in 2018."
The company declared a third interim dividend of 3.12p per share for its year ended June 30, up 2.6% from 3.04p 
for the year-ago period.
Huysinga is to depart the company, after over 10 years as its portfolio manager, in order to pursue a masters 
degree and role in the non-profit sector.
Trust Chair Nigel Wightman said: "Jeroen will continue to support the team over the course of the summer to 
ensure a smooth transition. The investment process for the company's portfolio management will remain 
unchanged. The board would like to thank Jeroen for his stewardship of the Company's portfolio during the past ten 
years and wishes him all the best for the future."

ROME (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC has breached Italian labour laws by evading social security and 
bonus payments for its airport staff, according to Italy's labour inspection agency.
"Serious violations" were documented during the course of 2014 at more than a dozen Italian airports served by the 
low-cost Irish airline, the agency said in a statement.
Ryanair was accused of having made "illicit recourse" to about 600 third-party workers to save on insurance, 
pension and bonus payments it would have had to pay to in-house staff.
The illegal conduct took place at airports in Bari, Bergamo, Pisa, Rome, Brindisi, Cagliari, Catania, Lamezia Terme, 
Milan Malpensa, Palermo, Pescara, Alghero and Trapani, according to the agency.
The airline was asked to pay EUR9.2 million in unpaid labour charges and fines, and investigators said they are 
now probing Ryanair's labour practices in the years following 2014.
Ryanair shares were trading up 0.2% in London on Wednesday at EUR12.77.

Ryanair said its February passengers totalled 9.6 million, up 13% from 8.6 million passengers a year before. 
Excluding Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion, Ryanair's passengers increased 9% to 9.3 million. 
Ryanair reported its February load factor came in at 96% in total and for the core airline, while Laudamotion had a 
load factor of 94%. Ryanair previously had reported a 95% load factor for February 2018.
Ryanair said it operated 53,000 flights in February, of which 93% arrived on time. According to the company, this 
meant that it delivered "the best punctuality of any major EU airline" for the period.
On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair's traffic was up 8.8% to 141.2 million from 129.8 million.
Wizz Air, meanwhile, posted a 14% increase in passenger traffic to 2.4 million from 2.1 million the year before. On a 
rolling annual basis, traffic rose 18% to 34.3 million from 29.1 million.
Wizz Air's load factor increased 3.0 percentage points to 94.2% from 91.2% year-on-year and its capacity increased 
to 2.5 million seats from 2.3 million.
Wizz Air said it continued to grow its network in February, with five new routes announced and the expansion of its 
fleet with a new Airbus A321, bringing its total fleet to 108 aircraft.
Shares in Ryanair were down 0.1% at EUR12.66 in London on Monday morning, while Wizz Air shares were up 
0.7% in the FTSE 250 at 3,059.60 pence.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening higher on Monday, tracking strong gains in 
Asia, amid optimism that a trade deal between the US and China is within sight. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index will open 26.37 points higher at 7,133.10. The blue chip index closed 2.00 
points, or 0.5%, at 7,106.73 Friday. 
Sentiment was given a boost after the Wall Street Journal over the weekend reported that the US and China are 
close to reaching a trade deal that could lift US tariffs on imports from China. The newspaper said China is offering 
to lower tariffs on US products in categories ranging from farms to chemicals and autos.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.0% in response. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 1.1%, while 
the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.7%.
"After months of trade tensions, the world's two largest economies are reportedly nearing a trade deal which would 
remove US tariffs on Chinese imports," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler.
"Markets are a sea of green as the new week kicks off. Trade deal optimism sent Asian markets sharply higher, 
whilst European and US futures are pointing to a strong start out of the blocks on the opening bell."
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4%, S&P 500 up 0.7% 
and Nasdaq Composite up 0.8%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3232 early Monday, marginally higher from USD1.3222 at the London equities 
close Friday. 
In political news, UK Prime Minister Theresa May was given a Brexit boost as key Tories signalled swinging behind 
her stance in exchange for movement on the Northern Irish backstop.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Higher Call On Hopes Of US -China Trade Deal
Chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Tories Graham Brady expressed optimism that a 
breakthrough on the backstop was close.
The hardline European Research Group of Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg also indicated a more conciliatory 
tone on the issue.
The ERG has drawn up "three tests" the government must pass to win backing, according to the Sunday Times.
A light economic events calendar on Monday has eurozone producer prices at 1000 GMT.
On Thursday this week, the European Central Bank will announce its latest interest rate decision. The central bank 
is widely expected to keep monetary policy unchanged. 
On Friday, there is the US jobs report for February due. 
The UK corporate calendar on Monday has full-year results from valve actuators manufacturer Rotork, speciality 
chemicals company Synthomer, engineer Senior and geotechnical contractor Keller Group. Also due are February 
traffic statistics from Ryanair.

BERLIN (Alliance News) - Europe's biggest budget airline is taking precautions in case of a no-deal Brexit by 
shifting some of its spare parts from a British central storage unit to other EU locations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC's director of maintenance and engineering told dpa that an unregulated departure by the UK 
from the EU could make moving parts around difficult because of customs restrictions, for example.
"We're concerned that it could take longer to get spare parts to airports where we need them quickly from the 
central storage in Stansted," Karsten Muehlenfeld said, referring to the London airport.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is an outspoken critic of Brexit, though he says his Irish airline, which is registered in 
the EU and not in Britain, will not be as badly affected as some British-based airlines.

ROME (Alliance News) - Low cost airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC were fined by Italy's 
antitrust regulator on Thursday for their hand-luggage restrictions.
The Italian Competition Authority said extra charges for larger carry-on bags, which the two airlines introduced last 
year, represented an unfair trade practice.
Being able to take on board a reasonably sized bag as part of the standard air fare is an "essential service" that 
should not be subject to additional fees, AGCM said.
It fined Ryanair EUR3 million and Wizz Air EUR1 million. Both companies were given 60 days to change their 
luggage policy.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday confirmed that 98% of its directly employed pilots 
based in Belgium have voted in favour of a four-year collective labour agreement governing their pay and 
conditions.
The agreement was negotiated between the budged airline and unions BeCa, CNE-CSC, and LBC-NVK.
Earlier in the day, Ryanair confirmed 98% of its directly employed pilots based in Belgium had voted in favour of a 
recognition agreement with BeCa, to cover all of Ryanair's directly employed pilots in Belgium.
The airline and BeCA were said to be progressing a collective labour agreement which they both hoped to conclude 
before the end of April. 
Ryanair has been talking with unions across Europe in regards to collective labour agreements. In January, the 
company said it is working on a recognition agreement with the SITCPLA and USO unions in Spain. In November, it 
recognised Portuguese union SNPVAC, and the same month signed a labour agreement covering all German cabin 
crews.
It has also signed similar agreements with Italian crews, and has been in talks with Greek and Swedish staff. 
In addition, on Wednesday Ryanair also said it will open a new base at Toulouse, France in October with two 
aircraft and 11 new routes.
The Irish airline said the new routes includes flights to Alicante and Valencia in Spain, Porto in Portugal, 
Luxembourg, Budapest in Hungary, Palermo in Italy, Tangier and Oujda in Morocco, and Brest, Lille and Marseille 
in France.
"We are delighted to announce a USD200 million aircraft investment at Ryanair's third French base in Toulouse 
airport, which will deliver 1 million customers per annum, create 60 Ryanair pilot and cabin crew jobs and support 
750 airport jobs," said Ryanair Chief Commercial Officer David O'Brien.
UPDATE: Belgian Ryanair Pilots Vote For Collective Labour Agreement
Ryanair shares were trading 0.4% higher on Wednesday at EUR11.95 each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Societe Generale took an upbeat view on the airline sector heading into the key 
summer season of 2019 deeming Ryanair as a stock to watch out for, but was mindful over the blue chip airline 
operator amid Brexit uncertainty. 
SocGen's Michael Kuhn and Sumit Mehrotra said 2018 proved to be a challenging year for the airline sector with 
high capacity, air traffic control issues and rising oil prices turning out to be a "toxic mix".
However, the analysts said the prospects for 2019 appear more upbeat with oil prices coming down from multi-year 
highs and capacity growth set to not be as excessive.
"Lower crude prices, still more frequencies and new city-pair additions should help support demand in 2019. But 
with our economists forecasting GDP growth easing across the eurozone this year, it is still unclear whether the 
multiplier will fall further and demand growth will slow, which would put EU airline profitability under pressure from 
the risk of capacity additions outpacing demand in 2019," Kuhn and Mehrotra said. 
As such, the analysts said investors should pick airlines that have a strong long-term track record, proven crisis 
resistance and limited Brexit risk, and that Ryanair embodies these qualities. 
SocGen upgraded the Irish carrier to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to EUR14 from EUR12.80. Ryanair 
shares were up 1.7% at EUR11.97 on Tuesday.
Kuhn and Mehrotra acknowledged that the last 18 months have been difficult for Ryanair with pilot rostering issues 
and a slew of profit warnings.
In late 2017, Ryanair came under fire over a rostering failure leading to thousands of flights being cancelled and a 
number of routes suspended - triggered a company-wide wave of unionisations. The outcome led to Ryanair having 
to pay sharply higher wages to its employees. 
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Will Soar In Peak Summer Season - SocGen
In January, the airline issued its second profit warning in four months, as it said airfares were falling more than 
expected over the winter.
However, the analysts took a positive stance on Ryanair saying its woes are now behind it. 
"After a negotiation marathon that Ryanair's management had to go through over the past year, most union issues 
have been resolved and the strike risk for Ryanair  has mostly dissipated. We think some of the new contractual 
agreements will somewhat trim Ryanair's flexibility, but we think its business model is far from being broken. We 
maintain our view that short-haul aviation is an increasingly commoditised business and that the lowest-cost 
operators will prevail in that segment in the long term," the pair said. 
In October, Ryanair also cut its annual profit guidance and was cautious over its outlook due to air-strikes higher oil 
prices and as economic uncertainties persist. 
"Even in an adverse scenario, we think Ryanair would be among the best airline stocks to hold, as industry 
consolidation would likely accelerate. Ryanair has also stated that it would reinitiate share buybacks once the 
outcome of Brexit is known (if it is not a hard Brexit)," Kuhn and Mehrotra said.
Turning to the FTSE 100, SocGen said easyJet and International Consolidated Airlines Group are prone to Brexit 
related risks. 
SocGen reiterated its Hold rating on easyJet and kept its price target at 1,270p. The stock was down 0.7% at 
1,273.50p Tuesday.
Kuhn and Mehrotra noted that easyJet has many positive qualities that an airline operator should possess, think the 
market is overestimating the company's earnings growth capabilities.
"The company is fundamentally sound, with close to GBP400 million net cash as of year-end 2018. However, 
easyJet's profile is now a more defensive than growth-oriented: its network is built on leading positions at capacity-
constrained prime airports, a strong brand, and a loyal customer base. While its cost base is not the lowest, we 
think it is probably the best in the value-for-money category," the analysts said. 
Moreover, the analysts said the biggest risk to easyJet is that a hard Brexit may trigger a short-term EU-UK air 
traffic shutdown.
"That said, we think a hard Brexit could have a 'silver lining' for easyJet in structural terms by accelerating 
consolidation across the airline industry. However, such a shakeout could take may years, putting a cap on 
earnings growth for longer. Compared with its low-cost peers Ryanair and Wizz Air, easyJet remains more 
dependent on the UK market," Kuhn and Mehrotra said. 
SocGen reiterated its Hold rating on IAG and kept its price target at 650p. The stock was down 0.8% at 644.80p 
Tuesday.
The analyst said IAG shares have recovered from the Brexit referendum outcome and has continued to deliver 
growth and margin improvement. Moreover, the British Airways and Iberia parent company is almost free of 
financial net debt.
Kuhn and Mehrotra highlighted that a hard Brexit would be detrimental for IAG as it would heighten regulatory and 
macroeconomic risks.
"Ownership remains a major challenge for IAG, as it would need to prove to regulators that BA's ownership and 
control is British, while Iberia's is Spanish. Senior EU officials have doubted that IAG's structure allows for that. The 
EU will give airlines a seven-month period to overhaul their shareholder structure, as the FT reported earlier this 
month. This is enough time, in our view, but might still trigger significant forced selling, as IAG's EU ownership 
excluding the UK might be as low as 25%," the pair said. 
IN THE KNOW: Ryanair Will Soar In Peak Summer Season - SocGen
SocGen downgraded Wizz Air to Hold from Buy saying the eastern Europe-focused airline is one of the best 
structurally positioned airlines in the sector, but its strengths seem to be adequately reflected in the share price.
The French bank cut its price target to 3,450p from 3,550p. Wizz Air shares were down 0.6% at 3,222.00p Tuesday. 
"Wizz Air remains one of the most interesting long-term stories in aviation, and the arrival of the A321neos in the 
fleet should help it to keep unit costs under control. However, at around 14.5 times 2020 price-to-earnings ratio, it is 
among the most expensive European airline stocks, and has outperformed most peers over the last 12 months," the 
analysts said.
However, Kuhn and Mehrotra said Wizz Air and Ryanir are the only carriers with strong medium-to long-term 
growth prospects in the central and eastern Europe market.
Moreover, the CEE region continues to deliver the highest growth rates in Europe, which should continue to favour 
Wizz Air, the pair added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - easyJet PLC on Thursday confirmed it is in talks with Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane 
Spa and the US's Delta Air Lines Inc in order to form a consortium to explore options regarding the future of 
beleaguered Italian airline Alitalia Societa Aerea Italiana Spa. 
Ferrovie dello Stato is a state-owned company that manages the Italian rail network, while Delta is an Atlanta, 
Georgia-based airline.  
At the end of October, easyJet submitted a proposal expressing interest in Alitalia after the Italian government was 
forced to rescue the Italian flag carrier in 2017.
Alitalia went into government-controlled administration in 2017 and was kept afloat by Italian state loans worth 
EUR900 million. The Italian government was supposed to recoup the money by December 15, 2018 and wrap up 
bankruptcy procedures; however it decided to extend the loan to June 30, 2019.
Back in June 2018, both easyJet and fellow budget operator Ryanair Holdings PLC expresses interest in acquiring 
Alitalia, with the latter backing out following chaos caused by strikes and flights cancellations.
easyJet already flies to many destinations in Italy, including Rome, Milan and Naples. 
easyJet shares were trading up 0.4% at 1,287.10 pence each.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Airlines and travel operators had a busy week as both TUI and Thomas Cook warned 
on lower margins, Ryanair swung to a loss and easyJet stepped up Brexit preparations.
In other key retail and consumer services news, Ocado reported a fire at one of its robotic warehouse, while data 
showed increases in both UK retail and grocery sales. 
Travel and airline operator TUI, in a surprise trading update, said that the out-of-the-ordinary hot weather in the 
summer resulted in later bookings, weakening margins. It also said continued weakness in Sterling made it difficult 
to improve margins.
TUI said that annual earnings for its current financial year will be "broadly stable" on last year due to "extraordinary" 
hot weather and the weakness of the pound.
For the year ending September 30, the company expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortisation to be broadly stable on the record performance in the prior year of EUR1.17 billion.
As a result of the "broadly stable" earnings guidance, the FTSE100 listed company said it will be unable to meet its 
guidance of at least 10% compound annual growth rate in underlying Ebitda at constant currency for the three years 
to 2020 financial year.
Similarly, on Thursday rival Thomas Cook also reported a year-on-year fall in first quarter gross margins due to cut 
throat competitive market in the UK and weak demand for winter holidays in the Nordics. 
The company also announced a strategic review of its airline business, which could potentially lead to a sale.
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Airlines Brace For Turbulence Ahead
"As expected, the knock-on effect from the prolonged summer heatwave and high prices in the Canaries have 
impacted customer demand for winter sun," Thomas Cook Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said.
Thomas Cook's revenue for the first quarter to end of 2018 rose 1% to GBP1.66 billion but the company's adjusted 
operating loss widened by GBP14 million to GBP60 million.
TUI shares were trading down 2.1% at 934.80 pence each on Friday, while Thomas Cook was down 16% at 
28.64p, retreating from gains made on Thursday. 
In the budget airlines sector, Ryanair announced changes to its corporate structure after posting a third-quarter loss 
and warning of lower annual profit.
The Irish airliner on Monday said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure "not dissimilar" to 
that of rival and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC.
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary will become group CEO, leading all the units, the airline said. O'Leary 
committed to further five years at the head of the company.
Ryanair said its third-quarter results to the end of 2018 were "disappointing", with the group swinging to a EUR83.6 
million pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago.
Revenue increased 9% in the third quarter to EUR1.53 billion from EUR1.41 billion on the back of higher customer 
numbers, up to 32.7 million from 30.4 million a year ago.
Looking ahead, Ryanair expects annual profit to be between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion, down up to 31% 
from comparative period, due to lower winter fares but better-than-expected cost performance in the second half. 
The company posted a profit of EUR1.45 billion for 2017 financial year.
With regards to Brexit, Ryanair - which had previously warned on the "underestimated" risk of a no-deal - said it has 
taken all the "necessary steps" to protect the company.
With Brexit just 49 days away, peer easyJet on Thursday also said it increased its EU ownership to 49% in order to 
be able to continue flying in Europe after the UK's exit from the European Union in March.
easyJet said it remains confident of its ability to continue flying whatever the outcome, as it has "undertaken 
significant preparations" since the vote of the referendum was delivered.
One of the major news in the retail sector this week was delivered by online grocer Ocado. 
Ocado on Tuesday reported a widened annual loss and a major fire at one of its warehouses. The company's 
earnings were hampered by higher operating costs in a year of major expansion that saw the online grocer ink 
several significant deals.
For the financial year to December 2, 2018, revenue rose by 9.9% to GBP1.59 billion from GBP1.45 billion a year 
prior, on the back of an increase in average number of orders a week and fees from partnerships.
However, Ocado's pretax loss came in at GBP44.4 million, widened from GBP8.3 million a year prior. Financial 
2017 results were restated after the adoption of new accounting rule IFRS15, last year the grocer had reported a 
GBP1.0 million profit.
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Airlines Brace For Turbulence Ahead
The pretax loss was significantly wider than analysts expectations, which had forecast Ocado's loss at GBP30.0 
million. 
During the year, Ocado inked deals with US retailer Kroger, Swedish supermarket group ICA, France's Groupe 
Casino and in Canada with Sobeys, as retailers lined-up to secure UK company's cutting-edge technology, which 
includes robots in warehouses.
Looking ahead, the online grocer said that, if economic conditions "remain broadly stable", it expects to achieving 
Retail revenue growth of between 10￿15% in financial 2019 as it prepares to increase its fulfilment capacity and 
grow market share in the UK.
Retail Ebitda is expected to grow, as the increased use of automated warehouses, called customer fulfillment 
centres, brings in cost savings and synergies, Ocado said.
It was at one of this warehouses in Andover, England, that a fire broke on Tuesday, just after the company 
announced its results. 
After continuing to burn overnight, Ocado said that the fire caused "substantial damage" to both the Andover 
building and its contents, as part of the roof collapsed.
"Ocado is working hard to minimise disruption for customers by increasing capacity at other facilities," it added.
Due to the presence of pressurised refrigerants on site causing risk of explosions, the area around the warehouse 
had to be evacuated on Wednesday night. 
Since then, the refrigerants have been removed from the site and the "major incident status" and evacuation have 
been lifted.
Ocado shares were trading up 2.0% at 891.20p each on Friday. On Monday, before news of the fire broke, Ocado 
shares were trading at 1000.50p. 
A wider overlook on the beleaguered retail sector led to a breath of fresh air, as UK retail sales picked up in January 
following the worst December in a decade. 
On Tuesday, the latest BRC-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor figures covering the four weeks to January 26, showed UK 
retail sales up 2.2% from the year before, as heavy discounting tempted cautious shoppers. 
This marked the highest annual growth since June and was above both the 3-month and 12-month averages of 
0.8% and 1.2% respectively. In December, total sales were flat compared to the prior year, marking the worst 
December performance since 2008.
"There was a welcome return to growth this month after December's disappointing sales figures. But while retail 
discounts helped tempt cautious consumers, there is no guarantee this momentum will continue after the sales 
have finished," Chief Executive Officer of the British Retail Consortium Helen Dickinson said.
Supermarkets also had reasons to celebrate this week, as data from Kantar Woldpanel covering the 12 weeks to 
January 27, saw UK grocery sales up 1.7% on the prior year.
However, despite reporting rising sales, all supermarkets, with the exception of Aldi, Lidl and Co-op, saw their 
market share dip on the prior year. The only grocer slipping, in sales, was Sainsbury's with sales down 0.3% during 
the period.

Grocery inflation now stands at 1.3%, Kantar reported, with prices rising since January 2017.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum reiterated its Buy rating on Ryanair Holdings saying the Irish carrier is still the 
"long-term industry winner", despite posting a third-quarter loss and warning of lower annual profit. 
The broker kept its price target at EUR14.50. Ryanair shares were down 2.5% at EUR11.15 on Monday and are 
down 31% over the past 12 months. 
Ryanair also said Monday it will make changes to its corporate structure. Under the proposed changes, a small 
senior management team led by Group CEO Michael O'Leary will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. 
Meanwhile, the airline said its third-quarter results to the end of 2018 were "disappointing", swinging to a EUR83.6 
million pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit last year, due to weaker than expected air fares.
The results included a EUR61.5 million loss resulting mostly from the acquisition of Austrian airline Lauda. 
Excluding Lauda losses, Ryanair still reported a EUR6.5 million operating loss versus a EUR126.0 million profit a 
year before, due to lower airfares.
Ryanair's third quarter revenue of EUR1.53 billion was lower than Liberum's forecast of EUR1.55 billion 
Liberum's Gerald Khoo said Ryanair's results showed a swing to an anticipated loss in the seasonally second 
weakest quarter of an airline's financial year.
The analyst said that "unsurprisingly" there was no change to the profit guidance of between EUR1.0 billion and 
EUR1.1 billion outlined at its most recent profit warning in January, when it said airfares were falling more than 
expected over the winter.
"Given the ongoing uncertainty over Brexit, and the potential impact on consumer confidence, the balance of short-
term risks remains to the downside. However, we expect attention to turn to next year, where the range of potential 
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Says Buy Ryanair Amid Share Price Weakness
outcome is much wider, but where there may be scope for optimism on more restrained industry capacity growth," 
Khoo said. 
Despite its recent woes, the Liberum analyst said Ryanair remains "the long-term winner in the European airline 
industry", due to its leading market position, extensive network, low unit costs and strong balance sheet. 
"We see tougher market conditions in the short term as positive for the stronger airlines in the long term, since this 
clears out weaker competitors and aids consolidation in the market. We would view short-term share price 
weakness as a buying opportunity," the analyst added.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London are seen opening marginally lower on Monday amid quiet 
trading in Asian markets. 
In early UK corporate news, Irish airline Ryanair announced a reorganisation, drugmaker Indivior divested its 
interests in China, and outsourcer Serco signed a big contract in Australia.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 0.52 points lower at 7,019.70. The blue chip index closed up 
51.37 points, or 0.7%, at 7,020.22 on Friday. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.5%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed up 0.2% after a half-
day session. Financial markets in China are closed on Monday for Chinese New Year's Eve and will remain closed 
for the rest of the week. Hong Kong's financial markets will be closed Tuesday to Thursday for the Lunar New Year 
holiday.
"Trading in Asia was quiet overnight as celebrations for Chinese New Year kicked off, and Chinese markets remain 
closed. We expect muted trading in Asia across the week, a sharp contrast to recent weeks which have seen US-
Sino trade headlines and China growth concerns drive movement. European and US futures are pointing to a quiet 
start with markets struggling for direction," said London Capital Gtopu's Jasper Lawler. 
The pound was marginally lower, quoted at USD1.3070 early Monday from USD1.3099 at the London equities 
close Friday.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May will invite rebel Tory members of Parliament into the heart of government on 
Monday to thrash out changes to her Brexit deal she hopes can overcome massive opposition in Brussels and 
Westminster.
Hardline eurosceptics in the European Research Group and Remain-supporting former ministers will form the 
Alternative Arrangements Working Group, which Downing Street said would meet "regularly" with Brexit Secretary 
Stephen Barclay and senior officials.
ERG deputy chairman Steve Baker, former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson and Yeovil MP Marcus Fysh 
will join forces with former education secretary Nicky Morgan and ex-cabinet office minister Damian Green to 
examine the feasibility of the so-called Malthouse Compromise.
FTSE 250 drugmaker Indivior said it is to divest its interest related to the Sai Bo Song drug in China to the Zhejiang 
Pukang Biotechnology Co for USD122.5 million.
"The divestiture of the Sai Bo Song tablet in China is consistent with Indivior's efforts to prioritize efforts on the long-
term growth opportunities with our new depot assets, Sublocade and Perseris," said Shaun Thaxter, chief executive 
officer of Indivior. "This transaction helps us focus our resources on the highest return opportunities in the regions 
we know best, while ensuring patients in China have access to an important and transformational treatment." 
Indivior also said it has signed an agreement with Alvogen Pine Brook prohibiting the US pharmaceutical company 
from distributing or selling its generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film product in the US.
Indivior had been granted a temporary restraining order by the US District Court for the District of New Jersey 
against Alvogen on January 24.
Outsourcer Serco Group said it signed a GBP560 million contract with Bupa Health Services to support the 
Australian Defence Force. The contract has up to four one-year extensions and full operational service under the 
new contract will begin on July 1. Under the contract, Serco will be responsible for providing defence support 
services across more than 50 bases in Australia. Serco will be delivering recruitment, on-boarding, training, 
workforce management and various other employee lifecycle, account management and support functions. 
Ryanair Holdings said it will make changes to its structure as the budget airline reported a swing to third-quarter 
loss and warned of lower annual profit. 
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team led by Group CEO Michael O'Leary will oversee 
the development of four airline subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. O'Leary has 
signed a new five-year contract to the lead the company.
Ryanair swung to a EUR83.6 million pretax loss in the third quarter from a EUR112.9 million profit in the 
comparative period a year ago. The company's loss included a EUR61.5 million loss resulting from the acquisition 
of Austrian airline Lauda. Excluding Lauda losses, Ryanair still reported a EUR6.5 million operating loss, versus a 
EUR126.0 million profit a year before. 
Wizz Air reported its January load factor improved by 0.4 percentage point to 88.1% and passenger numbers rose 
8.3% to 2.6 million from 2.4 million last year. The central and eastern Europe-focused airline said it expanded its 
network in January with an additional 14 routes announced in Macedonia, Romania and Albania.
Elsewhere, JPMorgan downgraded miner BHP Group to Underweight from Neutral.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it will make changes to its structure after 
swinging to a third-quarter loss and warning of lower annual profit. 
The Irish budget airline said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of 
rival International Consolidated Airliners Group PLC, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia. 
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. 
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary will become group CEO, leading all the units, the airline said. The company 
will, later this year, appoint a replacement as CEO of Ryanair DAC.
Chair David Bonderman and Senior Independent Director Kyran McLaughlin have agreed to remain on the 
company's board until summer 2020. They will leave after that date. 
"In order to ensure a smooth succession, Stan McCarthy who joined the board in May 2017, has agreed to take up 
the position of deputy chair from April 2019, and will transition to chair of the board in summer 2020," Ryanair 
added. 
Meanwhile, the airline said its third-quarter results were disappointing, with the group swinging to a EUR83.6 million 
pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago. 
The company's loss included a EUR61.5 million loss resulting from the acquisition of Austrian airline Lauda. 
Excluding Lauda losses, Ryanair reported a EUR6.5 million operating loss versus a EUR126.0 million profit a year 
before. 
Revenue rose 9% to EUR1.53 billion from EUR1.41 billion on the back of higher customer numbers, up to 32.7

O'Leary said: "While a EUR20 million loss in the third was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due 
to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and 
future traffic growth."
Ryanair load factor was unchanged compared to the prior year at 96%. 
Looking ahead, Ryanair said that, excluding an expected "heavy" loss from Lauda in its first year of operations, its 
annual profit will come in between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion due to lower winter fares but better-than-
expected cost performance in the second half. 
A year ago, Ryanair profit was EUR1.45 billion, so the decline will be as much as 31%. 
"While we have reasonable visibility of our fourth quarter bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares 
and/or slightly lower full year guidance especially if there are unexpected Brexit and/or security developments which 
adversely impact fares for close-in bookings between now and the end of March," the company added.

the week. 
Hong Kong's financial markets will be closed Tuesday to Thursday.
"Trading in Asia was quiet overnight as celebrations for Chinese New Year kicked off and Chinese markets remain 
closed. We expect muted trading in Asia across the week, a sharp contrast to recent weeks which have seen US-
Sino trade headlines and China growth concerns drive movement. European and US futures are pointing to a quiet 
start with markets struggling for direction," said London Capital Gtopu's Jasper Lawler. 
The pound was marginally lower, quoted at USD1.3070 early Monday from USD1.3099 at the London equities 
close Friday.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will invite rebel Tory members of Parliament into the heart of government on 
Monday to thrash out changes to her Brexit deal she hopes to overcome massive opposition in Brussels and 
Westminster.

On Thursday this week, the Bank of England will announce its latest interest rate decision and inflation forecasts. 
The central bank is widely expected to leave rates unchanged. 
In early UK corporate news, Ryanair Holdings swung to a third quarter loss and warned on lower annual profit.
The company swung to a EUR83.6 million pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a 
year ago. Third quarter revenue came in at EUR1.53 billion, up 9% from EUR1.41 billion the year before.
The Irish budget airline said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of 
rival International Consolidated Airliners Group PLC.
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary 
will become group CEO.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings on Monday said it will make changes to its corporate structure after 
swinging to a third-quarter loss and warning of lower annual profit.
The Irish budget airline said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of 
rival International Consolidated Airliners Group PLC, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia.
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK.
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary will become group CEO, leading all the units, the airline said. The company 
will, later this year, appoint a replacement as CEO of Ryanair DAC. O'Leary also signed a contract for another five 
years as head of the company.
Chair David Bonderman and Senior Independent Director Kyran McLaughlin have agreed to remain on the 
company's board until summer 2020. They will leave after that date.
"In order to ensure a smooth succession, Stan McCarthy who joined the board in May 2017, has agreed to take up 
the position of deputy chair from April 2019, and will transition to chair of the board in summer 2020," Ryanair 
added.
Meanwhile, the airline said its third-quarter results were disappointing, with the group swinging to a EUR83.6 million 
pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago.
LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair Chief Signs For 5 More Years Amid Restructure
The company's loss included a EUR61.5 million loss resulting from the acquisition of Austrian airline Lauda. 
Excluding Lauda losses, Ryanair reported a EUR6.5 million operating loss versus a EUR126.0 million profit a year 
before.
Revenue rose 9% to EUR1.53 billion from EUR1.41 billion on the back of higher customer numbers, up to 32.7 
million from 30.4 million a year ago.
O'Leary said: "While a EUR20 million loss in the third was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due 
to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and 
future traffic growth."
Ryanair load factor was unchanged compared to the prior year at 96%.

Japanese car maker Nissan Motor said it plans to switch production of a new SUV model from Britain to Japan, 
dealing another blow to the British government's post-Brexit economic plans. Nissan said it cancelled plans to 
produce the X-Trail model at its plant in the north-eastern English city of Sunderland, where it employs some 7,000 
people. "With X-Trail already manufactured in Japan, we can reduce our upfront investment costs," said Gianluca 
de Ficchy, Nissan Europe chairman. "We appreciate this will be disappointing for our UK team and partners," de 
Ficchy added. "While we have taken this decision for business reasons, the continued uncertainty around the UK's 
future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future," he said.

US President Donald Trump said Friday that negotiations with opposition Democrats over funding a border wall with 
Mexico have not advanced and that he may declare a national emergency in order to bypass Congress to build the 
barrier. "We're getting nowhere with the Democrats," Trump told reporters at the White House. "I think there's a 
good chance that we'll have to do that," he added, referring to declaring a national emergency. Trump did not 
definitely state whether he would declare a national emergency, which would enable him to fund a border wall 
without congressional approval but would certainly face legal challenges. Trump has agreed to open the 
government for three weeks, until February 15, to allow for negotiations with Democrats after a 35-day partial 
government shutdown, the longest in US history.

China has called on Washington and Moscow to solve their differences related to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear

the US announced that it was withdrawing from the agreement. The US said on Friday that it was withdrawing from 
the treaty with Russia, which dates to the waning years of the Cold War, amid accusations that Moscow is in 
violation of the deal.

Drugmaker Indivior said it has agreed to divest its interest related to the Sai Bo Song drug in China to Zhejiang 
Pukang Biotechnology for USD122.5 million. "The divestiture of the Sai Bo Song tablet in China is consistent with 
Indivior's efforts to prioritize efforts on the long-term growth opportunities with our new depot assets, Sublocade and 
Perseris," said Shaun Thaxter, chief executive officer of Indivior. "This transaction helps us focus our resources on 
the highest return opportunities in the regions we know best, while ensuring patients in China have access to an 
important and transformational treatment." Indivior also said it has signed an agreement with Alvogen Pine Brook 
prohibiting the US pharmaceutical company from distributing or selling its generic buprenorphine and naloxone

initially uncovered irregularities in the lender's loan book and not the company itself. Shares in the FTSE 250-listed

Interserve is closing in on a rescue deal to swap almost a half of its debt for shares in the company, Sky News

discussion for several months, is likely to involve swapping around GBP300 million of its borrowings for new shares, 
according to Sky. At the end of December, Interserve confirmed talks to swap debt for equity and said it expected to 
end 2018 with between GBP625 million and GBP650 million in net debt. At the time, the company said it would 
publish the final form of the plan in early 2019.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Monday said it will make changes to its corporate structure 
after swinging to a third-quarter loss and warning of lower annual profit.
The stock was down 4.5% early Monday at EUR10.925. Ryanair shares have lost 32% of their value over the past 
12 months.
The Irish budget airline said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of 
rival International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia.
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. 
The company said it believes the changes to its structure to be necessary to deliver cost and operating efficiencies 
as well as "enabling the group to look at other small scale merger and acquisition opportunities".
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary will become group CEO, leading all the units, the airline said. O'Leary 
committed to further five years at the head of the company.
Ryanair will, later this year, appoint a replacement as CEO of Ryanair DAC, it said. DAC stands for designated 
activity company and is the company's main operating unit.
Chair David Bonderman and Senior Independent Director Kyran McLaughlin have agreed to remain on the 
company's board until summer 2020. They will leave after that date.
"In order to ensure a smooth succession, Stan McCarthy who joined the board in May 2017, has agreed to take up 
the position of deputy chair from April 2019, and will transition to chair of the board in summer 2020," Ryanair 
added.

Meanwhile, the airline said its third-quarter results to the end of 2018 were "disappointing", with the group swinging 
to a EUR83.6 million pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago.
The results included a EUR61.5 million loss resulting mostly from the acquisition of Austrian airline Lauda. 
Excluding Lauda losses, Ryanair still reported a EUR6.5 million operating loss versus a EUR126.0 million profit a 
year before.
Ryanair bought a 75% stake in the Austrian carrier, founded by former Formula One racer Niki Lauda, in July after 
the takeover was cleared by EU competition authorities. In December, Ryanair upped its interest in Lauda to 100%. 
The company now expects Lauda to record EUR140 million of exceptional year-one start-up loss due to the "very 
late" release of schedules, low promotional fares, expensive aircraft leases and unhedged fuel.
For its second year, Ryanair is guiding for a loss from Lauda of between EUR50 million and breakeven, depending 
on peak season yields. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair as a whole reported a 9% increase in revenue in the third quarter to EUR1.53 billion from 
EUR1.41 billion on the back of higher customer numbers, up to 32.7 million from 30.4 million a year ago.
O'Leary said: "While a EUR20 million loss in the third was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due 
to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and 
future traffic growth."
Ryanair load factor, in the third quarter, was unchanged compared to the prior year at 96%.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said that, excluding the expected "heavy" loss from Lauda in its first year of operations, its 
annual profit will come in between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion due to lower winter fares but better-than-
expected cost performance in the second half.
A year ago, Ryanair profit was EUR1.45 billion, so the decline will be as much as 31%. 
"While we have reasonable visibility of our fourth quarter bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares 
and/or slightly lower full year guidance especially if there are unexpected Brexit and/or security developments which 
adversely impact fares for close-in bookings between now and the end of March," Ryanair said in its statement 
Monday.
"We do not share the recent optimistic outlook of some competitors that Summer 2019 airfares will rise. In the 
absence of further EU airline failures, and because of the recent fall in oil prices  we expect excess short haul 
capacity to continue through 2019, which will we believe lead to a weaker – not stronger – fare environment," it 
continued.
For January, the airline reported Monday that passenger numbers rose 11% to 10.3 million from 9.3 million a year 
prior, with Laudamotion contributing 300,000 new customers. 
On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair passengers in January were up 8% to 140.2 million from 129.4 million. 
During the first month of its fourth quarter, the company operated over 58,000 flights, with more than 90% arriving 
on time, excluding the delays due to air traffic control strikes, it said. 
In the past year, Ryanair suffered from prolonged strike action from both air traffic control workers and its own pilots 
and cabin crew members. 
Following the summer of strikes, Ryanair was able to sign deals with several unions across its international 
operations putting an end to the disruptions. 
EXTRA: Ryanair Swings To Loss On Lower Fares, Plans Restructuring
With regards to Brexit, Ryanair which had previously warned on the "underestimated" risk of a no-deal, said it has 
taken all the "necessary steps" to protect the company in that event. 
"We have now obtained a UK AOC to protect our 3 domestic UK routes, and we will place restrictions on the voting 
rights and share sales of non-EU shareholders for a period of time, in the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure that 
Ryanair remains at all times an EU owned and EU controlled airline, even if the UK exits the EU without a deal," the 
company explained.

LONDON (Alliance News) - The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.

COMPANIES

Ryanair Holdings said it will make changes to its corporate structure after swinging to a third-quarter loss and 
warning of lower annual profit. Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the 
development of four airline subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. Chief Executive

Indivior said it will divest its interest related to the Sai Bo Song tablet in China to Zhejiang Pukang Biotechnology for 
a maximum of USD122.5 million. Furthermore, the FTSE 250 drugmaker said it has entered into a deal with 
Alvogen Pine Brook restricting it from selling in the US its generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film 
products, competing with Indivior's opioid addiction treatment Suboxone. Suboxone accounts for around 80% of 
Indivior's revenue. Indivior had been granted a temporary restraining order by the US District Court for the District of 
New Jersey against Alvogen on January 24. The order will will remain in place until February 7, when a preliminary 
injunction hearing will take place.

Ferrexpo said it is conducting a comprehensive review of funds paid to a Ukrainian charity as part of its corporate 
social responsibility programme, after uncovering issues with the charity's accounts. The iron pellet producer 
explained its auditor Deloitte has received bank statements directly from the charity Blooming Land in order to verify 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair To Reorganise As It Reports Quarterly Loss
the use of contributions by Ferrexpo. The bank statements from the charity - which is entirely separately managed 
from Ferrexpo - revealed "as yet unexplained discrepancies". Consequently, Ferrexpo said it has decided to 
undertake a "comprehensive independent review" and is currently scoping the work. In the first half of 2018, 
Ferrexpo had contributed USD9.5 million to the medical and social services charity. It has not made any further 
donations since May 2018.
----------
Flybe Group confirmed it received a tentative proposal from former Stobart Group boss Andrew Tinkler, who offered 
a capital injection to the airline if its takeover by Connect Airways does not proceed. Flybe said that Tinkler made a 
"very preliminary, short and highly conditional outline contingency proposal" for a capital injection into the company, 
which would only take place if the sale of Flybe's operating business to Connect Airways were to be stopped. The 
proposal wasn't an offer for the entire company, Flybe said. However, the struggling airline said it "does not 
consider that the preliminary proposal offers the certainty required to secure the future of Flybe". "Accordingly, the 
board emphasizes to shareholders that it continues to regard the arrangements entered into with Connect Airways 
as being the only viable option available to the company which provides the security that the business needs to 
continue to trade successfully," Flybe said. Connect Airways is a joint venture among Stobart, Virgin Atlantic, and 
DLP Holdings, which agreed to acquire Flybe for 1 pence per share earlier in January.

Stocks in London were marginally higher amid low volatility as financial markets in China were closed for the Lunar

York.

ECONOMICS AND GENERAL
----------
Construction sector activity in the UK fell in January to its weakest level for ten months, the latest survey by IHS 
Markit showed. The UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index reading came in at 50.6 in January, down from 
52.8 recorded in December and missing consensus estimates of a score of 52.4. A PMI reading above 50 still 
suggests growth in the sector, however. The index posted above the 50-point no-change mark in each month since 
the snow-related decline seen in March 2018, but the latest expansion was the weakest seen over that ten-month 
period of growth, according to IHS Markit. IHS Markit highlighted that a number of survey respondents noted that 
Brexit uncertainty had led to hesitancy among clients and a corresponding slowdown in progress on new projects.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May will invite rebel Tory members of Parliament into the heart of government on 
Monday to thrash out changes to her Brexit deal she hopes can overcome massive opposition in Brussels and

secretary Owen Paterson and Yeovil MP Marcus Fysh will join forces with former education secretary Nicky Morgan 
and ex-cabinet office minister Damian Green to examine the feasibility of the so-called Malthouse Compromise.

Industrial producer prices in the Eurozone fell month over month in December, while their annual rate of increase 
slowed by a full percentage point, according to data released by Eurostat. Industrial producer prices fell by 0.8% in 
December after the decrease of 0.3% registered in November. Year over year, prices rose by 3.0%, slowing from 
an annual increase of 4.0% the month before. The euro area producer price index fell 2.6% month-on-month in the 
energy sector and by 0.4% for intermediate goods, while prices remained stable for non-durable consumer goods 
and increased by 0.1% for capital goods and by 0.2% for durable consumer goods. Prices in total industry excluding 
energy fell by 0.1% on the month before.

China has called on Washington and Moscow to solve their differences related to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear 
Forces Treaty. "The Chinese side opposes the US withdrawal and urges the US and Russia to properly resolve 
their differences through constructive dialogue," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on 
Saturday. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Russia will withdraw from the INF treaty, after 
the US announced that it was withdrawing from the agreement. The US said on Friday that it was withdrawing from 
the treaty with Russia, which dates to the waning years of the Cold War, amid accusations that Moscow is in 
violation of the deal.

team will oversee the development of four airline subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and 
Ryanair UK. Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary will become group CEO, leading all the units, the airline said. 
O'Leary committed to further five years at the head of the company. Meanwhile, the airline said its third-quarter 
results to the end of 2018 were "disappointing", with the group swinging to a EUR83.6 million pretax loss from a 
EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago. The results included a EUR61.5 million loss resulting 
mostly from the acquisition of Austrian airline Lauda. Excluding Lauda losses, Ryanair still reported a EUR6.5 
million operating loss versus a EUR126.0 million profit a year before. Peers easyJet and International Consolidated 
Airlines were down 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.

well. Angus, the operator of the licence, said the well has been perforated from 960 metres to 1,155 metres 
measured depth and produced in total 280 barrels. However, Angus said that "it has become apparent that a part of 
the perforated interval is producing water", which is inhibiting significant oil flow and therefore has not allowed for 
sustainable flow rates of oil. The firm is now looking to isolate the water zone.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Stock prices in London opened marginally higher on Monday after quiet trading in Asia 
overnight, while Ryanair fell after posting a loss in the third quarter and issuing a strident warning about Brexit. 
The FTSE 100 index was up 11.15 points, or 0.2%, at 7,031.37 in early trade. The FTSE 250 was 17.12 points 
higher, or 0.1%, at 18,828.49. The AIM All-Share was flat at 921.42.
The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.2% at 11,941.96, while the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 16,815.87. The Cboe UK 
Small Companies also was up 0.1%, at 11,287.85.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. 
On the London Stock Exchange, GVC Holdings was the best blue-chip performer, up 1.8% after Jefferies started

At the other end of the large cap index, miners were lower. Rio Tinto was down 1.3%, Glencore down 0.9%, 
Antofagasta down 1.0% and Anglo American down 0.7%. BHP Group was off 1.2% after being cut to Underweight

Economics.

Chinese manufacturing activity shrunk to a nearly three-year low in January as underlying trends in production 
weakened and export sales increased, according to a report that was released on Friday. Survey data from IHS 
Markit showed the headline seasonally adjusted Caixin Factory Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to 48.3 
from 49.7 in December. The reading was the lowest since February 2016. Any reading below 50 suggests 
contraction in the sector.
In the FTSE 250, William Hill was up 3.3% on Monday, after Jefferies started coverage on the bookmaker with a 
Buy rating and Shore Capital raised the stock to Buy from Hold. 
At the other end of the midcap index, Ferrexpo was the worst performer, down 6.0% after the iron pellet producer 
said it is conducting a comprehensive review of funds paid to a Ukrainian charity as part of its corporate social 
responsibility programme, after uncovering issues with the charity's accounts.
Ferrexpo explained its auditor Deloitte has received bank statements directly from the charity Blooming Land in 
order to verify the use of contributions by Ferrexpo.
The bank statements from the charity - which is entirely separately managed from Ferrexpo - revealed "as yet 
unexplained discrepancies". Consequently, Ferrexpo said it has decided to undertake a "comprehensive 
independent review" and is currently scoping the work.
In the first half of 2018, Ferrexpo had contributed USD9.5 million to the medical and social services charity. It has 
not made any further donations since May 2018.
Elsewhere, Ryanair Holdings was down 3.8%. The budget airline said it will make changes to its corporate structure 
after swinging to a third-quarter loss and warning of lower annual profit.
The Irish airline said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of rival 
International Consolidated Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia.
Meanwhile, the airline said its third-quarter results were disappointing, with the group swinging to a EUR83.6 million 
pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago.
In addition, Ryanair also raised concerns over the UK crashing out of the European Union without a trade deal. 
"The risk of a no deal Brexit remains worryingly high. While we hope that common sense will prevail, and lead to 
either a delay in Brexit, or agreement on the 21 month transition deal currently on the table, we have taken all 
necessary steps to protect Ryanair's business in a no-deal environment. We have now obtained a UK AOC to 
protect our 3 domestic UK routes, and we will place restrictions on the voting rights and share sales of non-EU 
shareholders for a period of time to ensure that Ryanair remains at all times an EU owned and EU controlled airline, 
even if the UK exits the EU without a deal," said Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary. 
Peer easyJet was the worst performer in the FTSE 100, down 1.9%. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.5% while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed up 0.2%. 
Financial markets in China are closed on Monday for Chinese New Year's Eve and will remain closed for the rest of 
the week for Chinese New Year. 
Hong Kong's financial markets were open for a half day on Monday and will be closed Tuesday to Thursday for the 
Lunar New Year holiday. The Hang Seng index ended Monday up 0.2%.
The pound was marginally lower, quoted at USD1.3084 early Monday from USD1.3099 at the London equities 
close Friday.

UK Prime Minister Theresa May will invite rebel Tory members of Parliament into the heart of government on 
Monday to thrash out changes to her Brexit deal she hopes can overcome massive opposition in Brussels and 
Westminster.
Hardline eurosceptics in the European Research Group and Remain-supporting former ministers will form the 
Alternative Arrangements Working Group, which Downing Street said would meet "regularly" with Brexit Secretary 
Stephen Barclay and senior officials.
ERG deputy chairman Steve Baker, former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson and Yeovil MP Marcus Fysh 
will join forces with former education secretary Nicky Morgan and ex-cabinet office minister Damian Green to 
examine the feasibility of the so-called Malthouse Compromise.
"There still appears little chance of the EU budging from its refusal to reopen the withdrawal agreement to drop the 
Irish border backstop. But the Political Declaration remains open for modification. And with the Government offering 
Labour MPs financial inducements to benefit their constituencies, and conducting discussions on safeguards and 
possible enhancements to workers' rights, there remains the possibility that a majority in Parliament could 
eventually be found for a deliverable Brexit," said analysts at Daiwa Capital Markets. 
The economic events calendar has UK construction PMI at 0930 GMT. There also are Italy inflation readings and 
eurozone producer prices at 1000 GMT. 
In the US earnings calendar on Monday, Google parent Alphabet will report earnings after the market close in New 
York.
