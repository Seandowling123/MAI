LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday that traffic in March fell by 200,000 passengers to 
5.2 million, expected by the firm due to the movement of Easter into April from March last year. 
The low-cost airline said traffic fell 4% to 5.2 million from 5.4 million in March. The load factor increased by 1% for 
the month to 80%. For the year to March 2014, Ryanair's load factor was 83%.
Annual traffic to March 2014 rose 3% to 81.7 million customers, a record for the company it said. 
"Ryanair traffic fell... previously guided, due to the movement of Easter into April (from March last year). Ryanair's 
load factor increased by 1% as customers continue to enjoy our lowest fares, easier to use website and recent 
improvements in customer service including allocated seating and a free second small carry-on bag," said Ryanair's 
Robin Kiely.
Looking ahead, Kiely said forward bookings for the summer months have continued to grow strongly. 
In March, the firm said it will add seven routes and increase flights on 21 existing routes in its winter 2014 schedule 
at Dublin airport, and eight new routes and increased flights on 36 other routes for its winter 2014 schedule at 
London Stansted. The firm also received a BBB+ rating from Standard & Poor's during the month, which, the airline 
said, makes it the highest rated airline in the world.
Shares in the airline were trading 0.28% lower at EUR7.7 per share in London Thursday morning.

IN THE KNOW: Liberum Raises EasyJet Price Target To 1,700p

LONDON (Alliance News) - Liberum Capital has increased easyJet's price target to 1,700.00 pence from 1,600.00p 
Wednesday following the release of an encouraging pre-close update on Tuesday.
In a trading statement on Tuesday, the airline company said that it expects a narrowed pre-tax loss of between 
GBP55 million and GBP65 million for the six months to March 31, lower than both the GBP61 million pretax loss 
posted in the same period of the previous year and the GBP70 million to GBP90 million loss that was forecast in 
January.
Subsequently, Liberum has updated its forecasts. 
The brokerage's full-year pretax profit and earnings per share estimates have been increased by approximately 3% 
for 2014, 2015, and 2016. It now expects pretax profit to come in at GBP597 million in 2014, up from the GBP580 
million previously estimated, and at GBP711 million and GBP773 million in 2015 and 2016, respectively, up from 
the previous guidance of GBP688 million and GBP754 million in each of the years.
While the broker said it sees scope for positive revenue momentum to continue, its earnings forecasts were already 
close to the top end of the consensus range. As a result, revenue estimates have only been increased marginally.
There also is the potential for further upside as jet fuel prices and exchange rates remain more favourable than 
Liberum's spot assumptions, says Gerald Khoo, an analyst at the broking house. If current levels are sustained 
through to the end of the year, there is further modest upside risk of up to 10% to the company's estimates, he 
says.
In the short-term, given the seasonal bias of the airline industry, the group's summer trading remains key, says 
Khoo. The pre-close update contained no information about forward bookings, but these will have improved since 
the last update, he says. Nevertheless, visibility is likely to remain limited, "given the importance of higher yielding 
late bookings," he adds.
IN THE KNOW: Liberum Raises EasyJet Price Target To 1,700p
Further ahead, "easyJet retains attractive long-term fundamentals, offering an unusual combination of growth, value 
creation and cash generation," says Khoo. "We expect it to continue to gain market share profitably at the expense 
of legacy network carriers, especially the second tier players that have weak hubs and which have not participated 
in industry consolidation," he says.
Liberum increases its price target, but retains its Hold recommendation.
On September 2014 estimate multiples of 14.3x price to earnings ratio, easyJet's valuation appears "reasonable 
rather than compelling in the short-term," says Khoo. However, this is more attractive than Ryanair, which appears 
to have returned to trading at a premium to the group, despite having a weaker return on invested capital.
EasyJet shares were quoted up 1.65% at 1,720.00 pence.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in low-cost airline easyJet PLC soared Tuesday after the company said it 
expects its pretax loss for the first-half to be lower than previous expectations as it revised expected revenue per 
seat higher after a milder winter reduced its de-icing costs. 
The FTSE 100-listed company was leading the blue-chip index after it said it now expects to deliver a first-half 
performance ahead of the guidance given in its interim management statement on January 23, when easyJet said it 
expected its pretax loss for the half-year to come in between GBP70 million and GBP90 million. 
easyJet's revised expectations state that the firm now expects a narrowed pre-tax loss of GBP55 million - GBP65 
million, compared to the GBP61 million pretax loss the previous year for the six months to March 31, 2014.
easyJet reduced its pretax loss expectation after better-than-forecast revenue per seat growth, and as costs 
excluding fuel rose less then it had expected thanks to the mild winter which resulted in a reduced levels of de-icing 
and disruption during the period. 
The company also said it was especially buoyed by its decision to introduce allocated seating, which has proved 
popular with other low-cost carriers, with rival Ryanair later following suit.
Revenue per seat growth at constant currency for the six months to March 31 is expected to be around 1.5%, said 
easyJet, driven partly by allocated seating, increased average sector length and several digital and revenue 
management initiatives. Previously the company said the metric would be "Very slightly up."
The uptick becomes more significant when considering that the reporting period does not include the Easter period, 
traditionally a busy time for airlines, thus boosting its expectations further. Last year Easter fell on March 31, 
resulting in GBP25 million of additional revenue in the first-half of 2013. In this financial year Easter will fall in its 
second-half on 20 April.
UPDATE: easyJet Soars As H1 Expectations Revised Higher On Milder Winter
Cost per seat growth, excluding fuel, at constant currency is expected to be around 0.5%, better than the forecast 
1.5% growth announced in January. This is due to a "benign winter with reduced levels of de-icing and disruption" 
in the three months to March 31 as well as the early delivery of a number of easyJet lean initiatives, said the 
company.
easyJet's unit fuel cost in the six months will be up to GBP8 million pounds adverse to the prior year. The impact of 
exchange rate movements will be broadly neutral compared to last year. The company's forecast for capacity 
growth for the first-half of the year remains unchanged at around 3.5%.
"easyJet has continued to execute its strategy delivering another good performance in the first half of the year. This 
performance demonstrates our continued focus on cost and progress against all our strategic priorities. It also 
demonstrates easyJet's structural advantage in the European short-haul market against both the legacy and low-
cost competition. Our strategy of offering our customers low fares to great destinations with friendly service and a 
focus on cost control ensures that we can continue to deliver sustainable growth and returns for our shareholders," 
Carolyn McCall, easyJet's Chief Executive said.
The airline has led the FTSE 100 for much of the day, now trading 5.18% higher at 1,716.48 pence per share.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Shares in easyJet PLC soared Tuesday as the low-cost airline said it expects its pretax 
loss for the first-half of its financial year to be significantly narrower than it previously expected, after the mild winter 
reduced the need for costly de-icing of its planes and reduced disruption.
The airline now expects to post a pretax loss of between GBP55 million and GBP65 million in the six months to the 
end of March, compared with the GBP61 million loss it recorded a year ago.
Airlines and travel companies tend to be loss-making over the winter period, making most of their money during the 
summer months when there are more travelers. 
Back in January, easyJet had said it expected to post a pretax loss of between GBP70 million and GBP90 million 
for the six months to the end of March. The expectation for a wider loss was mainly because Easter will fall in the 
second half of the financial year this year, having provided GBP25 million of additional revenue to its first-half 
results in fiscal 2013.
In January, Easyjet had expected cost per seat, excluding fuel and at constant currency, to rise about 1.5%, while 
revenue per seat at constant currencies was expected to be just "very slightly up". 
However, that expectation has now been reversed, with revenue per seat expected to grow 1.5% compared with a 
rise in cost per seat of 0.5%. It is still adding 3.5% more capacity than a year ago.
It cut its cost expectations because its planes needed less de-icing and there was less weather-related disruption in 
the three months to the end of March. The airline said the reduction also reflected the early delivery of the benefits 
of some of its efficiency improvement programme.
It cited its decision to allocate passengers with seats as one of the reasons for the improved seat revenue growth 
expectations, along with a number of "digital and revenue management initiatives" that it didn't detail. 
2nd UPDATE: EasyJet Soars As It Narrows Loss Forecast
The original model for most low-cost airlines was that seats weren't allocated and passengers took seats on a first-
come, first-served basis. However, that proved unpopular with customers as families and groups could end up 
being split up for the duration of the flight. eayJet trialed allocated seating in 2012, and introduced it across its fleet 
in November of that year following positive customer feedback. 
Big rival Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, initially resisted the move, but has also rolled out 
allocated seating on all flights from the start of February 2014. 
Customers pay a fee for choosing their seats on both airlines.
In its statement, easyJet said fuel costs for the first half of the financial year will be up to GBP8 million more than in 
the year-earlier period, but that the impact of exchange rate movements would be broadly neutral. 
Many companies have reported a hit from recent currency movements, particularly sterling's strength against other 
major currencies.
easyJet shares were up 3.4% at 1,686.00 pence just before the close Tuesday, one of the biggest gainers on the 
FTSE 100 and not far from the all-time high of 1,773 pence hit in February. The stock has risen 64% over the past 
12 months.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Thursday said it will add seven routes and increase flights on 21 
existing routes in its winter 2014 schedule at Dublin airport, a move that comes a day after it also increased its 
winter schedule at London Stansted.
In a statement, Europe's largest low-cost carrier said it will add routes from Dublin to Basel, Bucharest, Cologne, 
Lisbon, Marrakesh, Nice and Prague. 
It said the decision to increase its Dublin schedule was a result of the Irish government's decision to remove an air 
travel tax from April this year. 
The Irish airline Wednesday had announced eight new routes and increased flights on 36 other routes for its winter 
2014 schedule at London Stansted.
Separately Thursday, Ryanair said it had received a BBB+ rating from Standard & Poor's, which, the airline said, 
makes it the highest rated airline in the world.
Ryanair undertook the rating process as part of its plans to access capital markets to source secured and 
unsecured debt financing for its 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft order.    
"The BBB+ rating will enable us to achieve lower cost financing to ensure that we continue to have the lowest costs 
and the lowest fares in Europe," Ryanair Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Howard Millar said in a 
statement.  
Ryanair shares were down 0.8% at EUR7.172 in London Thursday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Friday said it has been granted leave to seek a High Court 
injunction against strike action at Irish airports on March 14. 
The Irish Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union plans to shut down Dublin, Cork and Shannon 
airports for four hours on March 14 to help resolve a long standing pensions-row. 
The airline said it will not allow over 13,000 of its customers to be "blackmailed by greedy SIPTU unions." 
Ryanair singled out Aer Lingus staff, saying that they receive a defined contribution pension scheme and these staff 
have already received over EUR600 million in pay-offs, pension top ups and free shares over the past 8 years. 
The news comes as Ryanair failed in an appeal on Friday against the Competition Commission's decision to force 
Ryanair to sell down its minority stake in Aer Lingus to 5% from 29.82%. 
"SIPTU's attempt to shut down air access from the country's three main airports is unlawful, unnecessary and unfair 
to passengers," Ryanair said in a statement. 
The company said it is taking legal action to protect its customers and said that if it goes ahead, the company will 
make every effort to minimise the disruption to its customers who will be contacted early next week with details of 
any rescheduling of their flights. 
Ryanair also called on the Irish Department of Transport to explain its contingency plans regarding the strike action. 
Ryanair shares closed down 2.1% at 7.34 pence Friday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Aer Lingus Group PLC Friday said it welcomes today's decision by the UK Competition 
Appeal Tribunal rejecting Ryanair's appeal against Competition Commission's decision to force Ryanair to sell down 
its minority stake. 
In August, the CC issued a report showing that Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus is anti-competitive and that it 
must sell down its 29.82% stake in Aer Lingus to 5%.
The report also limited Ryanair's ability to acquire further shares in the future. 
Ryanair appealed against the decision on a number of grounds, all of which were rejected on Friday. 
In a separate statement, Ryanair said that it has instructed its lawyers to appeal the ruling to the UK Court of 
Appeal.
“Today’s CAT judgment is a key milestone on the path toward removing Ryanair from the Aer Lingus share 
register," Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington said in a statement. 
Ryanair shares closed down 2.1% at 7.34 pence, while Aer Lingus shares closed down 1.2% at 1.68 pence Friday.

The Bank of England's monetary policy meeting is likely to be a 'non-event', with policymakers expected to pledge a 
low interest rate regime and refrain from any action that risks recovery. The nine-member rate-setting committee is 
expected to retain the interest rate at a historic low 0.50% and its quantitative easing programme unchanged at 
GBP 375 billion. The interest rate has been at the current 0.50% since March 2009, when policymakers lowered it 
by half a percentage point, and launched its asset purchase programme valued at GBP 75 billion.
----------
The European Central Bank is expected to announce Thursday its decision to hold interest rates at a record low of 
0.25% despite concerns about low levels of inflation. The ECB last trimmed borrowing costs in November, when it 
cut its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 basis points. Since then, a slew of key economic indicators have pointed to 
the eurozone economy gaining strength, helped along by a pickup in exports and corporate investment. However, 
ECB chief Mario Draghi warned this week that at 0.8% in February, consumer prices remained "way below" the 
bank's annual inflation target of just under 2%, which could create a problem in ensuring price stability.
----------
The Bank of Japan is prepared to adjust its monetary policy further if required to achieve the 2% inflation target, 
Deputy Governor Kikuo Iwata said, reiterating the central bank's policy stance. In a speech delivered at the Upper 
House Budget Committee, Iwata said that the central bank will continue to assess the risks to its economic and 
price outlook, and make necessary changes to meet the goal of hitting the price target. According to Iwata, Japan's 
economy is on steady track towards achieving the 2% inflation target.
----------
China's economic growth could be a little lower than the 7.5% target this year, and the government is focused more 
on creating jobs than strictly maintaining the strong growth momentum, Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said. Speaking 
to the media on Thursday during the annual parliament session, Lou said that he sees growth of 7.2% of 7.3% for 
this year, signaling that the 7.5% target is flexible.
----------
Economic growth in the emerging markets weakened further in February as an improvement in service sector 
activity was more than offset by a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, survey data published by Markit 
Economics and HSBC Bank revealed. The Emerging Markets Index, which gauges business activity across 
emerging market economies, dropped to 51.1 in February from 51.4 in January, marking the third successive 
decline.
----------
France's unemployment rate decreased moderately in the December quarter, after staying steady in the preceding 
two quarters, data published by statistical office Insee revealed. The ILO (International Labor Organization) 
measure of unemployment rate for metropolitan France and overseas departments decreased to a seasonally 
adjusted 10.2% in the fourth quarter from 10.3% recorded in each of the preceding three quarters. Compared to the 
fourth quarter of 2012, the jobless rate was unchanged.

Russia has refused to bow to demands from the US and Europe for direct talks with the new Ukrainian government 
but agreed to continue talks Thursday in hopes of defusing the crisis in Crimea. US Secretary of State John Kerry 
said some progress was made at talks Wednesday in Paris, where he and the foreign ministers of Germany, 
France and Britain and French President Francois Hollande met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Kerry 
characterized the talks as "very constructive" and said the focus now turns to a meeting Thursday in Rome, where 
he and Lavrov were both expected.
----------
The EU said it was freezing the assets of 18 people suspected of misappropriating Ukrainian state money including 
toppled president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled Kiev last month. Any assets the individuals have in the EU are to be 
frozen, and there are also provisions in place facilitating the recovery of the frozen funds, the EU governments said. 
EU leaders convening at an extraordinary summit later Thursday in Brussels were set to consider possible action 
against Russia over its military intervention in Ukraine, amid mounting tensions between Moscow and the West.
----------
The EU on Wednesday upped the pressure on France and Italy to reinvigorate their sputtering economies, warning 
that the wider eurozone may face trouble otherwise. Presenting the latest round of EU reviews, Economy 
Commissioner Olli Rehn noted that while the four largest economies in the crisis-battered currency bloc - Germany, 
France, Italy and Spain - "could make the largest contribution to growth in Europe," all four countries have problems 
with economic imbalances. Italy faces particular pressure because the European Commission deems that it faces

Iran will not dismantle its nuclear programme but is prepared to provide assurances that it will remain peaceful, 
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said. "Those who are calling for the dismantling of Iran's nuclear 
programme are conducting wishful thinking," Zarif said after talks with his Indonesian counterpart Marty Natalegawa 
in Jakarta. "The only way you can have assurances that Iran's programme will remain peaceful is to have it out in

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group has jumped Thursday after it said its Spanish 
airline Iberia has finally agreed, in principle, a new restructuring deal with its pilots' union SEPLA. 
The British-Spanish airline holding company said that the deal, which ends years of conflict between the airline and 
the union, will mean fundamental productivity improvements and a salary freeze until 2015 and then increases 
linked to the airline's profitability.
"This brings an end to a series of industrial relations disputes that have hampered Iberia's turnaround in recent 
years," says Liberum Capital analyst Gerald Khoo.
Despite the lack of financial details, which makes it difficult to quantify the benefits of the deal, Khoo believes that 
Iberia now has the potential to emerge with a cost base on a par with the best network carriers, which would open 
up the opportunity for a return to profitable growth. As a result, he is now more confident that Iberia will deliver its 
contribution to the company's operating profit target of EUR1.8 billion in 2015, suggesting that there "may even be 
upside risk here."
Elsewhere in the group, Khoo remains confident that British Airways will hit its targets. He has a more neutral view 
on Vueling, however, believing that its moves into non-Spanish bases, including Brussels Zaventem and Rome 
Fiuminco, have attracted counter attacks from Ryanair.
Although IAG currently trades at a premium to the other European network carriers, Khoo continues to view this as 
deserved, "given the better restructuring momentum at IAG and the stronger core market experience by British 
Airways."
Subsequently, Liberum retains its Buy recommendation, with a price target of 450.00 pence.
IAG shares are quoted up 1.0% at 434.00p, placing them amongst the biggest risers in the FTSE 100.

IAG's Iberia Gets A Deal With Pilots Union At Last

LONDON (Alliance News) - International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC Thursday said Iberia has finally reached 
agreement in principle with pilots' union SEPLA to introduce permanent structural change and improve the airline's 
viability, a deal that is key to turning around the struggling business. 
IAG was formed in 2011 when British Airways and Iberia merged under one holding company. The group added 
Spanish airline Vueling to its stable last year. However, since its formation, British Airways has been performing 
well while Iberia has lagged, weighed down by legacy issues that meant its staff costs were comparatively high in 
an airline industry that has been seeking to reduce those costs over the last decade.
IAG Chief Executive Willie Walsh had turned British Airways around partly by reducing its high staff costs. It took 
several years as pilot and cabin crew unions were resistant to the changes brought in, but paid dividends in terms 
of improved profitability. Walsh has been trying to get similar agreements at Iberia.
The Spanish airline had put forward restructuring proposals in November, which were rejected by unions, and had 
then put forward less-stringent proposals in January, which unions also rejected at that time. However, the pilots 
union has now come to an agreement in principle, meaning the airline now has to get a deal with its cabin crew and 
baggage handlers.
In its statement Thursday, IAG said the deal with Iberia's pilots union will mean fundamental productivity 
improvements and a salary freeze until 2015 and then increases linked to the airline's profitability.
Pilots had already had their salaries cut by 14%, but were facing a further 4% cut. That 4% cut has now been 
scrapped in return for the agreed productivity improvements.
IAG said the deal will facilitate the growth of Iberia and its Iberia Express operation and heralds a new positive 
working relationship between Iberia and the pilot union after years of conflict.
IAG's Iberia Gets A Deal With Pilots Union At Last
"This groundbreaking deal reduces the cost structure and provides the foundation for the airline to grow profitably. 
A strong and profitable Iberia can protect jobs in the long term and boost tourism which is a key driver in Barajas 
and Spain's economic recovery," Iberia Chairman Luis Gallego said in the statement. 
"Luis has deservedly won the respect of the industry, his colleagues and the trade unions. Permanent structural 
change was the only way to save Iberia from slow decline. This agreement marks the beginning of its future," Walsh 
said.
IAG launched Iberia Express in April 2012, moving Iberia's short- and medium-haul operations into a new entity with 
a low-cost base better able to compete with the likes of easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC. Its operating costs 
were up to 30% lower than those of Iberia, but further expansion had been threatened as unions resisted further 
cost cutting.
"This agreement also enables the growth of Iberia Express with a competitive cost base and provides promotion 
opportunities for current Iberia and Iberia Express first officers. Iberia Express will help make Iberia profitable and 
stronger, by providing short haul feed, and will provide Spanish competition to low cost carriers," Gallego said.
Iberia's struggles with its unions aren't over yet. It is still battling to get an agreement with cabin and baggage 
handler unions. The UGT union in late January threatened strike action after rejecting the revised and less-stringent 
labour deal put forward by Iberia management, although it has entered arbitration first as required under Spanish 
law. 
IAG shares were down 0.4% at 427.94 pence Thursday morning.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday that traffic grew during 
January to 4.6 million customers and that it retained its load rate during the month, as it announced revisions to its 
on-board rules for PEDs
Ryanair said customers flown in January rose by 5% to 4.6 million from the 4.3 million reported in January 2013 for 
the month. Load factor for the month remained unchanged at 71%.
On an annual basis, traffic to January 2014 rose 3% to 81.6 million, with a rolling load factor for the year of 83%.
Ryaniar's Robin Kiely attributed the passenger growth to the firms' low fares and improved website, as well as 
noting the recent introduction of allocated seating, which was implemented last Saturday (February 1 2014). 
"Further improvements will be rolled out over the coming months as Ryanair continues to lower prices and improve 
our industry leading customer service," Keily added.
Also announced today, Ryanair has relaxed its rules on the use of portable electronic devices on all of its flights. 
The airline will now allow the use of devices, such as tablets, smartphones, e-readers and MP3 players, for the 
entire duration of their flight, as long as they have been switched to 'flight mode' and all safety demonstrations have 
been observed, said Ryanair. 
Kiely said, "The IAA [Irish Aviation Authority] is one of the first regulatory authorities in the world to approve this 
measure and we wish to commend them for their initiative. We are working hard to improve our service to all 
customers and today's PED approval is the latest in a series of changes which we know our customers will love."
Ryanair shares were trading 1.13% at 7.13 pence per share Thursday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Monday kept its full-year profit guidance unchanged after it 
moved to cut costs and ramp up seat offers in response to the downturn that it had reported last autumn, and it 
raised its passenger number guidance thanks to the recent launch of new bases.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier saw its shares rise strongly after it reported that passenger numbers grew 6% in its 
fiscal third quarter and forward bookings in the current quarter are running well ahead of last year, albeit at lower 
yields, a better performance than it has reported in its last two trading updates.
The re-iterated guidance comes after the Irish airline cut its guidance twice during the autumn after warning that it 
was seeing pressure on fares. It reacted by cutting costs and ramping up its use of promotions. It said fares are still 
under pressure, but it has managed to increase passenger numbers and cut fuel costs, partly offsetting the impact.
In its statement Monday, Ryanair said it still expects its full-year net profit to be between EUR500 million and 
EUR520 million, the same guidance it had given in November. The November guidance was a reduction from the 
guidance for a profit of between EUR570 million and EUR600 million it gave in September, which itself was a cut 
from previous guidance.
It said it expects its yields to fall by about 8% in the fourth quarter, slightly better than the 10% decline it had guided 
for previously.
Ryanair reported a net loss of EUR35.2 million for the three months to end-December, compared with a profit of 
EUR18.1 million a year earlier, its largest loss for the third quarter for five years. Revenues were flat at EUR964 
million compared with EUR969 million, even though passenger numbers rose to 18.3 million from 17.3 million. It 
said the profit decline was due to a 9% fall in average fares and a weaker sterling.
"We responded to this weaker pricing environment last September with seat promotions and lower fares which 
stimulated traffic across  all markets resulting in 6% growth in the third quarter, and a 1% rise in monthly load 
factors," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement.
Ryanair Soars As It Halts The Downturn, Flybe Also Turning Around
"Ancillary revenues grew by 13%, significantly faster than traffic growth due to strong customer uptake of reserved 
seating, priority boarding, and higher credit card fees," he added.
The airline's adjusted unit costs fell 9% in the quarter.  
It said it is 90% hedged for its full-year fuel needs at a cost of USD980 per tonne, and it said it has taken advantage 
of recent oil price and dollar weakness to extend its hedge position to 90% for full-year 2015 at USD960 a tonne. It 
said the fuel hedging, combined with its euro/dollar hedging programme, will deliver fuel cost savings of about 
EUR80 million in 2015. 
"Market pricing remains soft but is no longer declining. We reacted quickly to last autumn’s weakness with a range 
of lower fares, seat promotions, and recently increased advertising and marketing spend. As a result forward 
bookings in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2015 are running significantly ahead of last year, albeit at weaker 
yields," the airline said in its outlook statement.
"We expect our strategy of lowering fares and increasing forward bookings will enable us 
to better manage close in bookings and yields as we move into summer 2014," it added.
The airline expects full-year passenger numbers to rise to 81.5 million, slightly higher than it had previously guided, 
helped by the launch of new bases in Italy and Brussels and by higher load factor, which is a measure of how full its 
planes are. 
"Advance bookings for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 are significantly higher than this year’s comparable, even 
allowing for the impact of Easter," it said.
Ryanair's shares were up 4.1% at EUR6.57 in London Monday morning.
In other airline news, Flybe Group PLC Monday said its trading in the fiscal third quarter had been in line with 
overall management expectations. The low-cost airline said UK scheduled revenue per seat was up 2.3%, while 
costs per seat, excluding fuel and restructuring costs, were down 5.2%. It said revenue from white label flying in 
Finland rose 23.7%.
Flybe is going through a major restructuring, and has targeted cost cuts of GBP40 million this year and further cost 
benefits of GBP7 million this year and GBP26 million next year. It had proposed cutting 500 jobs, but Monday said 
the figure will be about 450. However, it said it is still on track to meet its costs targets.
It said revenue under management was up 5% to GBP203.5 million in the third quarter, while group revenues was 
in line with the third quarter of its last financial year at GBP142.9 million. Sales revenues for the current fiscal fourth 
quarter are up about 3%, driven by higher passenger volumes partially offset by lower yields.
"In the short-term, Flybe's revenue will be affected as it discontinues unprofitable routes. However, the group's 
improved cost structure will, the board believes, provide Flybe with a firm foundation for future profitable growth," it 
said in a statement.  
Flybe shares were up 2.6% at 108 pence early Monday.

LONDON (Alliance News) - UK banks are still counting the cost of their product mis-selling, with Lloyds Banking 
Group Monday adding a further GBP1.93 billion to the amount it has set aside to cover claims for previous sales of 
payment protection insurance and interest rate hedging products.
The new provisions bring the amount Lloyds has set aside for PPI in the last financial year to GBP3.05 billion, and 
comes just just one week after Royal Bank of Scotland said it was setting aside a further GBP465 million to cover 
PPI claims. Lloyds' overall provision for the PPI scandal now stands at GBP9.83 billion, while the figure is GBP3.1 
billion at RBS.
Lloyds had expected PPI claims to start tailing off, but said the decline is slower than it expected.
The bank still expects to make a small pretax profit for 2013 and hopes to start paying a small dividend in the 
second half of the year, but there will be no payout for last year. 
The stock is the biggest decliner on the FTSE100 Monday.
There was better news for shareholders elsewhere, as drinks can maker Rexam announced a shareholder return 
and BBA Aviation said it is mulling one.
Rexam said it intends to return about GBP450 million to shareholders through a redeemable B share scheme and a 
share consolidation, once it receives the USD805 million cash proceeds from the proposed sale of most of its 
healthcare packaging unit to private equity, a move that will leave it focused on drinks cans.
FTSE250-listed BBA Aviation, meanwhile, said it is considering returning some cash to shareholders after it 
completed the sale of its APPH operations for USD128 million in cash, a move that disposes of most of its 
manufacturing operations, leaving it focused on airport and airline services. 
One of the biggest movers Monday morning is low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, which halted its recent run of 
profit warnings.

Europe's biggest low-cost airline kept its full-year profit guidance unchanged after it moved to cut costs and ramp 
up seat offers in response to the downturn that it had reported last autumn, and it raised its passenger number 
guidance thanks to the recent launch of new bases. 
Ryanair reported its biggest third-quarter loss for five years, but saw its shares rise strongly after it reported that 
passenger numbers grew 6% in the quarter and said forward bookings in the current quarter are running well ahead 
of last year, albeit at lower yields, a better performance than it has reported in its last two trading updates. 
In currency news, the pound is the worst performing G10 currency against the dollar at the beginning of the week, 
hitting an 11-day low, after UK manufacturing sector data came in worse than hoped.
The UK manufacturing sector expanded in January, but at a slower rate than had been expected, with the Markit 
Manufacturing PMI recording 56.7, down from 57.2 in December. Economists had expected a reading of 57.0.
Still, the new wasn't so bad for Chancellor George Osborne. While the PMI currently stands at its lowest level in 
three months, it is still well above the series average of 51.3. Companies scaled up output in response to stronger 
demand. There were reports of improved demand from the domestic market and rising levels of new business from 
overseas and the ongoing rebound in the sector led to further job creation at the start of the year, Markit said. 
In Europe, the PMI data largely exceeded expectations and continued the trend of strong German growth 
supporting weaker but improving numbers elsewhere in the eurozone.
In political news, Syrian rebels are set to take part in the second round of peace talks between the Syrian 
government and the opposition in what should be the first direct participation by an armed group in the negotiations. 
Several leaders of the Free Syrian Army will participate in the talks, scheduled to start February 10, said the 
opposition Syrian National Coalition, which participated in the first round.
Officials in the Higher Revolutionary Military Council, the FSA's governing body, said officers are currently forming a 
shortlist of six rebel officials to accompany the coalition to Geneva next week.
Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych, who was hospitalized as tensions escalated between his government and 
the opposition, is expected to return to work Monday. The presidency confirmed his release from hospital Sunday, 
four days after he was admitted with acute respiratory problems.
"After concluding the necessary treatment, the president feels well - his physical condition is satisfactory," 
Yanukovych's office said. Opposition groups have for weeks been staging violent protests in the capital Kiev and 
other parts of the country, demanding the president's resignation and early elections. 
The development came as EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said that the EU and the US are working on 
an aid package for the country, aimed at helping the country into a transitional phase, the Wall Street Journal 
reported.
Anti-government protesters have retreated from two of the key Bangkok intersections they have occupied since 
January 13 as part of their effort to paralyze the government, but vowed to keep their demonstration going. Protest 
leader Suthep Thaugsuban said the regrouping was necessary to protect demonstrators from expected attacks by 
the caretaker government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Thailand's Election Commission postponed its announcement of the country's election results on Sunday after 
voting was disrupted in more than 10% of polling stations across the country. Polling was successfully held in only 
89.2% of the country's 93,952 polling stations due to protesters blocking voting, a lack of ballots and insufficient 
election officers. A new poll is scheduled for February 23 to allow the 440,000 voters affected by the protests to cast 
their ballots.

KEY UK CORPORATE NEWS:
FTSE 100: Smith & Nephew is set to acquire medical devices company ArthroCare Corp for USD1.7 billion. The 
firm will pay USD48.25 per share for the Texas-based firm, which it said is a 20% premium over ArthroCare's 90-
day volume-weighted average share price. The medical technology company said that ArthroCare's products would 
compliment and strengthen its sports medicine business. Randgold Resources said it achieved record production in 
2013, but pretax profit fell because of the lower gold price. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Chief Executive Ross 
McEwan is set for a meeting with the Bank of England over the bank's capital position, the Sunday Telegraph 
reported. GlaxoSmithKline is expected to announce plans this week to launch late stage clinical trials on ten new 
drugs over the next two years, the Daily Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the information. The list will 
include medicines in Glaxo’s key areas of cancer and respiratory disease, the newspaper said. The news came as 
the firm said it had received Breakthrough Therapy designation for its bone marrow disorder treatment 
Promacta/Revolade from the US Food and Drug Administration.
FTSE 250: Mitie Group said it has it experienced "good" organic growth since the start of October last year, driven 
by new and expanded contracts. The company said it expects losses from the closure of its cyclical mechanical and 
electrical engineering contracting businesses to cost more in the second-half than in the first, reversing its previous 
guidance that these losses would ease. The outsourcing company said it is continuing its move to target higher 
growth and profit margin businesses, as it turns its long-term strategy towards growing its core markets of facilities 
and property management.
AIM: Shares in Ormonde Mining are up after it received formal environment impact clearance for its Barruecopardo 
tungsten project in Spain. Energy Technique is another gainer after its nine month pretax profit was up nearly five-
fold, ahead of management expectations. Nostra Terra Oil & Gas is up after it entered into a USD25 million credit 
facility with Texas Capital Bank in order to fund growth without diluting its shares, while it also said it expected to 
have its largest working interest yet at a new well in the Chisholm Trail Prospect. Shares in Alexander Mining have 
been lifted after it signed a major commercial licence, financing and consultancy agreement with hedge fund Ebullio 
Group. It will receive GBP2.5 million in cash royalties as it licenses its AmmLeach technology to Ebullio for use in 
developing a large mining portfolio in Turkey. Oxford Advanced Surface is also up after it entered a project with Sun 
Chemical Ltd, supported by a grant of GBP179,000 from the UK's innovation agency, the Technology Strategy 
Board. The two companies will work on creating a novel radiation curable coating platform than they hope will 
differentiate to ink-jet inks for packaging. Hummingbird Resources is another gainer after it received further positive 
results from its infill drilling programme at its Tuzon deposit and said it will start further drilling at the Dugbe F 
Resource imminently. Iofina is up after the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation in the US state of 
Montana gave positive feedback on the company's water rights application. Blinkx is another riser after agreeing a 
partnership with Crown Media Family Networks, which owns the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movie Channel, to 
provide targeted advertising using Crown Media's original content. Blinkx will use its AdHoc platform to place 
relevant advertising against Crown Media's content, with resulting revenue shared between the two companies. At 
the other end of the market, shares in Rurelec have dropped after the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague 
awarded it much less than hoped for under the company's Bolivian compensation claim. The court granted 
immediate compensation of USD35.5 million to Rurelec, higher than the GBP20.6 million paid to acquire its 
UK MIDDAY BRIEFING: Mis-Selling Bill Continues To Mount For UK Banks
controlling stake in Guaracachi in 2006, with a further USD5.5 million due to be paid back to Rurelec by Guaracachi 
itself. But the figure was well below a USD142.3 million estimate by the company's valuation experts and the 
USD75 million that Chief Executive Peter Ear has often mentioned. Shares in Scotgold Resources are also down 
after it said it is evaluating its options for a smaller project at the Cononish Gold and Silver Project in Scotland 
because of the continued global economic uncertainty and volatile metal prices means getting funding for mining 
projects remains difficult.

VIENNA (Alliance News) - The European markets ended the first day of the new trading week in negative territory. 
Investor sentiment was impacted by the drop in Chinese non-manufacturing data, which signaled that the economy 
is slowing amid Beijing's efforts to push through the planned reforms. The Chinese data overshadowed the 
Eurozone manufacturing data, which moved back into expansion territory.
An indicator of Chinese non-manufacturing sector activity declined in January, in another sign that the economy is 
slowing amid Beijing's efforts to push through the planned reforms. The non-manufacturing purchasing managers' 
index declined to 53.4 in January from 54.6 in December, the results of a survey by the China Federation of 
Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP) and the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks declined by 1.63%, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major UK companies, lost 1.56%.
The DAX of Germany dropped by 1.29% and the CAC 40 of France tumbled by 1.39%. The FTSE 100 of the UK 
decreased by 1.11% and the SMI of Switzerland fell by 1.03%.
In Frankfurt, RTL Group declined by 2.62%. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to ''Neutral'' from ''Buy.''
Hawesko dipped 0.20%. The stock was downgraded to ''Hold'' from ''Add'' at Commerzbank.
Evonik rose by 0.70%, after Exane BNP started the stock with an ''Outperform'' rating.
In London, Lloyds Banking Group dropped by 3.97%. The lender said it has made a further provision of 1.8 billion 
pounds for legacy PPI business. Barclays lost 2.50% and Royal Bank of Scotland sank by 1.97%.
ARM Holdings decreased by 0.53%. Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to ''Hold'' from ''Buy.''
Smith & Nephew advanced by 1.14%, after it agreed to buy US-based Arthrocare.
European Markets Pulled Back On China Concerns
Ryanair, which reported financial results, increased by 6.81%. RM, which proposed a special dividend, surged by 
14.60%.
Julius Baer tumbled by 5.93% in Zurich. The private banking group said it expects to achieve the asset transfer 
target from the integration of Merrill Lynch's International Wealth Management to be towards the lower end of the 
57 billion francs to 72 billion francs range.
The Eurozone manufacturing sector grew slightly more than initially expected in January, Markit Economics showed 
Monday.
The final results of Purchasing Managers' survey revealed that the manufacturing activity grew at the strongest rate 
since May 2011. The headline PMI has risen in each of the past four months and has signaled growth since July 
last year.
The PMI rose to 54 in January, above the flash estimate of 53.9, from December's score of 52.7. The expansion led 
by Germany, and the Greek PMI moves back into expansion territory.
German manufacturing sector growth rose to its strongest in thirty-two months in January, a survey by Markit 
Economics showed Monday. The headline Markit/BME purchasing managers' index rose to a 32-month high of 56.5 
in January from 54.3 in December. The flash result showed a reading of 56.3.
French manufacturing sector contracted less than initially estimated in January, final results of a survey by Markit 
Economics showed Monday. The final purchasing managers' index rose to a four-month high of 49.3 in January 
from 47 in December. The flash survey results published last month showed a reading of 48.8 for January.
The UK manufacturing sector continued to expand in January, reflecting improvement in output and new orders, 
survey data from Markit Economics showed Monday.
The seasonally adjusted Markit/Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply Purchasing Managers' Index fell more-
than-expected to 56.7 in January from 57.2 in December. Economists had forecast the reading to fall to 57.1 from 
December's originally estimate score of 57.3.
The average asking prices for a house in the UK was up 0.3% in January compared to the previous month, property 
tracking website Hometrack said on Monday in its monthly survey. That's slower than the 0.5% monthly increase in 
December, although it represented an expansion for the 12th consecutive month.
While the Institute for Supply Management released a report on Monday showing modest growth in US 
manufacturing activity in the month of January, the pace of growth slowed much more than economists had been 
anticipating.
The ISM said its purchasing managers index fell to 51.3 in January from a revised 56.5 in December. A reading 
above 50 indicates continued growth in the manufacturing sector, but economists had expected the index to show a 
much more modest decrease to a reading of 56.0.
Construction spending in the US showed a slight increase in the month of December, according to a report released 
by the Commerce Department on Monday, with an increase in spending on private construction more than 
offsetting a drop in spending on public construction.
The report said construction spending inched up by 0.1% to an annual rate of USD930.5 billion in December from 
the revised November estimate of USD929.9 billion. Economists had expected spending to come in unchanged 
compared to the previous month.

The Asian stocks fell across the board, as data pointing to slowing growth in China's manufacturing and services 
sectors added to concerns the global economic recovery is faltering.
In the US, futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks closed firmly in negative 
territory, as investors digested a handful of disappointing earnings reports and mixed economic data. The Dow shed 
0.9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell half a percent and the S&P 500 slid 0.7%.

DUBLIN (Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC Monday reported a third-quarter net loss of EUR35.2 million, 
compared with a profit of EUR18.1 million a year earlier. 
Its basic loss per share was 2.50 euro cents, compared with a profit of 1.25 euro cents in the prior year. Its pretax 
loss was EUR41.8 million, compared with a profit of EUR19.3 million.
Total operating revenues from continuing operations were 964.4 million euros, compared to 968.8 million euros, 
previous year. 
Load factor for the quarter was 82%, compared to 81% prior year. Traffic grew 6% to 18 million passengers. 
Revenue per passenger declined 6%, as strong ancillary revenue growth offset a 9% fall in fares. Excluding fuel, 
sector length adjusted unit costs fell by 9%.
The group attributed its third-quarter loss to a 9% decrease in average fares and a 6% increase in total operating 
expenses, offset by strong ancillary revenues and increased traffic.
Ryanair said its fiscal 2014 guidance for net profit remains unchanged in the range of 500 million euros to 520 
million euros. The company expects its fiscal 2014 traffic to rise to 81.5 million passengers, slightly higher than 
previously guided.
