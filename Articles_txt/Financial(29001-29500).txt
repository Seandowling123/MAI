Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said Tuesday that it expects the European Commission to 
block its €1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus PLC.
It claimed the decision to be made before July 4 was politically motivated and was designed to appease the Irish 
government.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he planned to challenge an EU refusal to approve the takeover at the 
EU courts.
A block would be unprecedented, he said, as it was a deal that he claimed would cut air fares and fuel surcharges, 
amounting to €100 million (US$135 million) in savings.
"This is a nakedly political decision ... looking after the narrow vested interests of the Irish government," he told 
reporters in Brussels.
He claimed that a block would make further takeovers between European airlines more difficult, such as a possible 
bid by Air One for Alitalia or a British Airways-led consortium offer for Iberia.
Only Dublin and Aer Lingus had made antitrust complaints about the deal, he said.
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said in November that he was rigorously opposed to a new airline monopoly that 
could emerge if Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus succeeded.
The two airlines control over 70 percent of the Irish short-haul market but less than 5 percent of the entire European 
market.
Ryanair says it competes directly against Aer Lingus Group PLC on only 17 out of 500 routes but analysts say that 
number is higher if cities, rather than airports, are used to define routes. Ryanair usually flies to smaller airports 
farther away from the city destination, using a shuttle bus to connect the two.

Low-fare airline Ryanair vowed Tuesday to sue EU regulators if they blocked its hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish 
airline Aer Lingus, claiming it was the victim of political bias.
The European Commission has until July 4 to block or clear the deal and has pointed to "serious competition 
concerns" with the proposed combination of Ireland's two major airlines because it could reduce customer choice 
and raise fares.
But Ryanair Holdings PLC Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he expected the EU's executive arm to refuse him 
permission to buy the former state-owned carrier, a "politically motivated" decision that he said aimed to please the 
Irish government, Aer Lingus PLC's biggest shareholder.
"This is a nakedly political decision ... It's all to do with looking after the narrow, vested interests of the Irish 
government," he told reporters in Brussels.
EU spokesman Jonathan Todd refused to confirm that the EU would block the deal, saying only that consumer 
interests were "at the foremost in the Commission mind" during its antitrust probe.
Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said O'Leary was just a sore loser whose attempt to eliminate his 
nearest rival had failed. "He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure," Mannion said.
O'Leary said only Dublin and Aer Lingus oppose the deal, claiming that the 1.48 billion euros ($1.9 billion) deal 
would neither create an EU monopoly nor harm customers because he planned to reduce Aer Lingus fares by 10 
percent in the first year and scrap fuel surcharges.
"It would be a remarkable decision, a historical unprecedented decision for the Commission to turn down a merger 
of two airlines with less than 5 percent of the EU market and to turn down a merger that for the first time in the 
history of EU airline consolidation guarantees a 100 million euros ($135 million) per annum in fare cuts," O'Leary 
said.
Ryanair threatens to sue EU if it blocks Aer Lingus takeover
"It also sends a message that it's going to be much more difficult for EU airline consolidation to proceed," he said, 
pointing to a possible takeover of Alitalia by its Italian rival Air One and British Airways PLC's potential bid for Iberia.
But regulators are more worried about customer choice because the two airlines overlap on a number of European 
routes and are each other's closest competitors for services out of Ireland. The country has few passenger ferry 
links to Britain and Continental Europe.
Together, the two would control more than 60 percent of all flights in and out of Dublin's only commercial airport.
The European Commission rarely blocks deals stopping only one since 2001 and usually seeks selloffs or changes 
to business behavior to remove antitrust concerns.
O'Leary said Ryanair had tried to soothe antitrust worries of shrinking competition by offering Aer Lingus' coveted 
slots at London Heathrow to British Airways and Air France in return for those airlines and one other starting new 
routes out of Dublin.
The Commission had previously cleared Air France and KLM to combine even though both had more than a 60 
percent share at Paris Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol airports, O'Leary said.
"It's not a principle we expect will stand up in the European court and if it was ... then Air France would not have 
been allowed to buy KLM," he said.
Growing rapidly from its Irish base into Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in 
Europe, spearheading no-frills cheap flights that forced others to do the same.
O'Leary claimed his bid for Aer Lingus opposed by nearly half of the shareholders was good news for the share 
price, as word of a possible EU regulatory refusal had sent shares slipping from 3 euros ($4.04) to a new low of 
2.39 euros ($3.22) on Tuesday morning.
"There's nobody else out there who wants to acquire a small loss-making European airline," he said.

The Dublin market took yet another tumble today with shares in C and C slumping by over 6pc.
Just after midday the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 42.31 points to 9,342.30.
Shares in C and C were down 66c to 10.07 after new figures from the UK revealed that growth in the cider market 
appears to be moderating. New Custom and Excise data reveal that UK cider clearances rose by 10pc year-on-year 
in April. This represents a slowing in the rate of growth from 23pc in March. Fears are growing that cool wet 
weather currently hitting the UK and Ireland could also have an adverse effect on the number of people drinking 
cider.
 Financial shares put in a mixed performance, with AIB down 10c to 20.70, Bank of Ireland up 15c to 15.32 and Irish 
Life and Permanent down 12c to 18.58. Anglo Irish Bank was down 1c to 15.29. Ryanair slipped into the red as the 
market awaits the EU's decision on its bid for Aer Lingus. The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, reiterated 
again today that he expects the European Commission in the coming week to block its proposed E1.48bn hostile 
acquisition. He said such a move would be "unjustified" in the case of two airlines, which between them account for 
less than 5pc of the EU air travel market. Other notable movers today included Elan, down 29c to 15.27, FBD 
Holdings, up 39c to 32.35, and Irish Continental Group, up 50c to 32.35. CRH was down 24c to 36.78 and Smurfit 
Kappa fell 15c to 18.80.

Highlight: Ryanair's O'Leary is preparing today to respond to the expected rejection from the EU of its Aer Lingus 
bid.
Body
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary is preparing today to respond to information that the European 
Commission will block the Irish low-cost air carrier's proposed E1.48bn hostile acquisition of flag carrier Aer Lingus 
tomorrow.
Ryanair said O'Leary will meet reporters in Brussels to "discuss Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus and the European 
Commission's leaked decision to block it".
Reports last week said that the commission is ready to veto the deal.
 Sources said that while Ryanair has offered remedies to alleviate the commission's antitrust concerns, the moves 
have not been sufficient. In particular, new remedies offered during the EU executive's in-depth second phase 
inquiry have not been seen as credible. One of the sources said Aer Lingus' opposition to the deal would have 
created difficulties for the tie-up from the start. The commission was set to rule on the deal by July 4, but a negative 
ruling could come tomorrow, with the commissioners holding their weekly meeting. The deadline was extended 
several times as commitments, specifically on slots at Dublin Airport and London's Heathrow Airport, have been 
offered. Ryanair's finance director, Howard Miller said that the group expects a "politically motivated" negative 
decision and that the carrier would likely challenge the commission's review of Ryanair's proposed offer in the 
courts. "The Irish government is not in favour of it (the proposed merger) and the EC competition authorities 
generally do what the governments want to do," Miller said. "It has approved other similar deals but when it comes 
to two carriers operating with less than 5 pct of the market share, they decide they're not going to approve it, so you 
can only assume it's a politically motivated decision." His comments echoed those of CEO O'Leary on May 9: "The 
EU will rule in the interests of the Irish government rather than the consumer," he said. "We hope they will approve 
(the deal) but we suspect they won't, in which case we will immediately appeal to the European Court." A verdict 
against Ryanair's lapsed bid would be "purely political", in light of the approval of Air France's tie-up with KLM and 
Ryanair's O'Leary readies response to EU
Flybe's recent takeover of BA Connect, O'Leary said at a press conference in London. Ryanair withdrew its E2.80 
per share takeover bid at the end of December last year after the commission launched an in-depth inquiry citing 
"serious competition concerns" over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines. Ryanair did not withdraw 
the notification of the deal to regulatory authorities, though, and has said it would consider making another offer if 
the European Commission approved the proposed takeover. The commission noted its concern over combining 
Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer choice and lead to higher fares. At the time, EU 
competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said: "My main priority on this case is to make sure that consumers would 
continue to enjoy a competitive choice of airline services."

Body
The European Commission said it 'refutes completely' Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary's claim it would 
make a 'nakedly political' decision on its bid for Aer Lingus.
'I can refute that (claim) completely,' EU competition spokesman Jonathan Todd said.
'The commission is under an obligation to be completely impartial and objective,' he added.
 'It is very easy to criticise a decision which has not yet been taken,' he said, noting the deadline for the inquiry is 
July 4. 'A decision will be taken at the latest by July 4, until such time I cannot make any comment of prejudge the 
commission's decision,' Todd said. O'Leary said this morning the expected veto would be 'unjustified' and a 
'nakedly political' decision. In response to O'Leary's claims that the EU leaked information regarding the process 
and decision-making of the file, Todd said the commission had not leaked any information about any ongoing 
merger investigation. 'Trying to get merger information out of the commission is as easy as trying to get blood out of 
a stone,' he told reporters here. 'If anyone here has ever obtained information from the commission regarding an 
ongoing merger inquiry I would invite you to raise your hand now... I cannot see any hands raised,' he said. Todd 
said the reason why the deal was being scrutinised was due to the fact that both airlines operate out of the same 
home base airport. He said the potential market overlap would be higher in this case, compared to other cases 
involving airlines, which operate out of different home bases

Shares in Dublin staged a late recovery today to close unchanged with modest gains in Anglo Irish Bank and Elan 
outweighing sharp falls in C and C.
The ISEQ had been down by more than 80 points during the early part of the session, however, a late rally saw the 
index close 0.31 points higher at 9,384.30.
Anglo Irish Bank led the way in a mixed financial sector, jumping 20c to 15.50, while Bank of Ireland edged up 12c 
to 15.29. Irish Life and Permanent and AIB both ended the session in the red, down 3c to 13.27 and 10c to 20.70 
respectively.
 Drinks group C and C endured a torrid time, slipping 5pc, or 52c, to 10.21, after new figures from the UK revealed 
that growth in the cider market appears to be moderating. New Custom and Excise data reveal that UK cider 
clearances rose by 10pc year-on-year in April. This represents a slowing in the rate of growth from 23pc in March. 
Fears are growing that cool wet weather currently hitting the UK and Ireland could also have an adverse effect on 
the number of people drinking cider. Today's falls mean the company's share price has now decreased by over 
10pc this week. Other notable movers included building materials giant CRH, down 26c to 36.76, FBD Holdings, up 
24c to 32.30, and insulation products manufacturer Kingspan, up 10c to 20.42. Meanwhile, Ryanair tacked on 6c to 
close at 5.00, while Siteserv jumped 3pc, or 7c, to 0.87. Irish Continental Group ended the session 10c higher at 
22.60, Veris fell 15c to 3.70 and Independent News and Media tacked on 6c to 3.67. Elsewhere, Elan was one of 
the session's star performers, jumping 2pc, or 30c, to 15.86. The gains came after Marketscope magazine named 
the stock as a top stock for the current year. Editor, Ken Kam, said he is now re-recommending the shares as his 
current favourite for the balance of 2007. "Elan has been strong on rumours Biogen - Elan's 50pc partner for its

trials. "When a stock makes a big move in a short period, there is a tremendous temptation to sell and lock in 
profits. However, when the price move is accompanied with good news, the initial bump may be the start of a major 
move up. If you are too quick on the trigger, you may miss the bigger, longer term." Shares in the company have 
soared by more than 35pc in the year so far. However, Mr Kam says he would not be surprised if the stock slips 
back a little in the near future. "I suspect that many people will decide to sell to lock in the strong recent gains. I 
would not be surprised if the stock gave back half of its recent rise. If it does, I'll be buying more."

Body
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary today said the that carrier expects the European Commission in the coming week to 
block its proposed E1.48 billion hostile acquisition of Aer Lingus.
The no-frills airline held a press conference in Brussels to respond to the recent European Commission leaks 
indicating that Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus will be prohibited.
Speaking at today's press conference, O'Leary said the prohibition is "unjustified in the case of two airlines, which 
between them account for less than 5pc of the EU air travel market.
 The airline said that the prohibition reverses 20 years of EU airline consolidation which has seen the Commission 
approve all other mergers between larger competitors including Air France/KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss and 
Lufthansa/Austrian, all with minimal remedies. O'Leary said the decision is "politically motivated, designed to 
appease the narrow interests of the Irish Government, which was the only party (other than Aer Lingus itself) to 
object to the merger. Ryanair also confirmed that it will oppose any attempt by the European Commission to require 
it to dispose of its stake in Aer Lingus. Ryanair highlighted that it owns just 25pc of Aer Lingus, and has no control 
over Aer Lingus which remains controlled and run by the Irish Government and its trade unions. Ryanair also

Highlight: Aer Lingus accused Ryanair of "lashing out".
Body
Aer Lingus today accused Ryanair of "lashing out" in an attempt to disguise its failure to take out its competitor. 
This comes after the no-frills airline held a press conference in Brussels to respond to the recent European 
Commission leaks saying that Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus will be prohibited.
In a statement issued today Dermot Mannion, chief executive, Aer Lingus, said, "Michael O'Leary has sought to 
"take out" his closest competitor and he has failed. He is now lashing out in a vain attempt to disguise that failure.
 "If the EU Commission announces a prohibition decision following its exhaustive investigation, it will represent 
another boost for Aer Lingus and for consumers. We have made tremendous strides over a relatively short time in 
successfully executing our strategy and look forward to making even more progress in the coming months. The 
environment is competitive and we will continue to fight to deliver on our excellent prospects as an independent 
company."

Insurer FBD's shares tumbled today after it issued a trading statement warning that its marketplace is becoming 
"increasingly challenging".
Its shares ended 102 cent lower tonight at 3196, with other financial shares also falling in sympathy.
A better performance by other types of share stopped the ISEQ index from falling too far. It ended the session down 
just 11.22 points at 9,384.61.
 In its statement, FBD said trading in the first six months had been 'comfortable', but cautioned that 'price 
competition remains intense and our full year gross premium written target will become increasingly challenging 
unless pricing pressure moderates'. It also warned that weak government bonds are likely to hit its profits in the full 
year. Among other fina ncial shares, AIB was down 5c to 2090, Bank of Ireland down 14c to 1516 and Anglo Irish 
Bank up 1c to 1526. Irish Life and Permanent slumped 10c to 18.80. Trading in the construction sector was 
sluggish, with Grafton dropping 18c to 1070, McInerney slipping 1c to 250, and Kingspan falling 23c to 2019. 
However, CRH rose 37c to 37.04 after data out on Monday showed that US existing home sales fell, but slightly 
less than expected by markets, suggesting that the US housing market decline is showing little sign of slowing at 
the moment. Existing home sales in the US slipped by 0.3pc in May to a 5.99 million unit annual rate, the lowest 
since June of 2003, but a sliver above the 5.97 million units expected by market analysts. Inventories of unsold 
homes last month hit their highest level since the housing slump of the early 1990s, while the median sales price 
was down 2.1pc. Drinks group C and C fell sharply, down 37c to 1073, as it continues to buy-back its own shares. 
The company will spend a total of E300 million on shares in the coming months. The buy-back programme will lend 
support to the share price against the background of the English smoking ban, which comes into effect next 
weekend. Paddy Power was another share to fall markedly in the closing stages. Shares in the bookmaker were 
down 5c to 2175 following reports at the weekend that it is set to launch a new Spanish language website. With the 
ISEQ closes at 9384.61, down 11.22
betting market in Spain worth around E22 billion per year, and estimated to almost double by 2020, the venture 
could prove to be extremely profitable for the company. The company launched a German language sportsbook last 
year. Similar ventures have been mooted in Poland, Italy and Portugal. Other notable movers included Elan, down 
1c to 1541, Kerry Group, up 25c to 2080, and DCC, down 29c to 2497. Ryanair was up 1c to 486 despite reports 
from Reuters that the EU is set to reject Ryanair's E1.48 billion bid for Aer Lingus when the European Commission 
vetoes the bid on Wednesday. Elsewhere, UTV was unchanged at 623 despite the media group missing out on UK 
media group Chrysalis, who it was rumoured to have been interested in.

The Dublin market slumped by more than 1pc in the opening minutes this morning, with shares in FBD Holdings

The EU is set to reject Ryanair's E1.48 billion bid for Aer Lingus when the European Commission vetoes the bid on 
Wednesday. 
According to a source quoted by Reuters news agency, the European Union competition authorities are to reject 
Ryanair's takeover bid, which has been on hold since December. 
The airline has already said that it is unlikely that they will get EU competition approval. However, the airline has 
vowed to challenge any EU rejection in European courts Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, on whose 
recommendation the Commission will act, has blocked only one other deal during her tenure Ryanair has already 
built up a 25pc stake in Aer Lingus. Three days after Aer Lingus floated on the Irish Stock Exchange in October 
Ryanair bought 16pc of the airline and made a E1.48 billion offer to buy the company. At the end of March the 
Commission sent a statement of objections about the bid to Ryanair, saying it is concerned the proposed deal

Body
Financial shares suffered sharp falls for the second consecutive day today, dragging the Dublin market over 1pc 
lower.
Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 105.46 points to 9,396.46.
Ireland's four main banks account for just short of half of the Dublin's share capital meaning that when they tumble 
into the red, the wider market follows.
 The banks have taken a major hit in recent sessions after Irish Life and Permanent this week said it expects new 
mortgage lending levels to drop by E800m this year. This has raised fears further about a major slowdown in the 
Irish property market and the economy in general. Anglo Irish Bank led the fallers in the sector this morning, 
slipping 32c to 15.23, while Bank of Ireland and AIB fell 20c and 31c to 15.15 and 20.95 respectively. Irish Life and 
Permanent was down 7c to 18.75. Construction stocks performed little better with Grafton down 25c to 10.85, 
Kingspan down 23c to 20.58 and McInerney fell 3c to 2.52. CRH was also lower, down 40c to 36.60, after the 
building materials giant confirmed its first foray into the Spanish do-it-yourself market through a joint venture deal 
with a small local player. The company has agreed a deal with Jelf Brico House, which has 10 DIY stores in Spain. 
Robert Eason, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers, described the deal as similar to the way it entered the 
Portuguese DIY market 12 years ago. Other notable movers this morning included pharmaceutical group Elan, 
down 14c to 15.42, drinks group C and C, down 6c to 11.34, and paper packaging firm Smurfit Kappa, down 34c to 
18.90. Ryanair also slipped into negative territory, down 3c to 5.00, while Greencore slipped 1c to 5.25. Elsewhere, 
trading in Irish Continental Group was reasonably quiet as investors wait to see what will happen next after Eamonn 
Rothwell this week increased his stake in the ferry operator. Shares in ICG were down 22c to 22.50. Meanwhile, 
Paddy Power was a notable faller, down 46c to 22.00, despite new figures this week showing that the number of 
broadband users in Ireland grew by 16pc during the second quarter of the year to 602,000. The online division 
contributed 51pc of group operating profit last year and was cited by the company as an avenue for future growth.

Body
Failure to start construction work on the new second terminal (T2) at Dublin Airport will increase the cost of the 
project by around E3m per month, it has been claimed.
The Dublin Airport Authority said the rise in costs is a real possibility unless An Bord Pleanala gives the E400m plan 
the go-ahead by the end of this month.
The new terminal is due to open in November 2009, however, Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) chief executive Declan 
Collier claims delays in planning could push this date out until March 2010 at the earliest.
 Such a delay would increase the cost of the project by E12m, he added. Planning permission for T2 was appealed 
to An Bord Pleanala by Ryanair and local residents' groups. The board says it is still considering its decision. Mr 
Collier is believed to have written to Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary asking him to withdraw his objection. 
O'Leary remains vehemently opposed to the plans which he has labelled as "gold plated". The Irish Times reports 
today that the DAA is planning on raising up to E500 million through a corporate bond to help pay for the new 
terminal.

Body
Ryanair has announced it is extending its £10 seat sale into the summer peak months of July, August and 
September in response to continuing softness in the market.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the sale of 3m seats for £10 including charges and taxes, which will cost the 
company between 25 and £45m, would stimulate late bookings and increase the airline's yields.
'Bookings are going very strongly, loads are strong but yields are lower,' he said at a news conference in London. 
'It's good for passengers but bad for profits.'
 He said the market softening is confined to the UK, and he put the blame on a doubling of BAA's charges at 
Stansted to £12 per passenger, the £5 increase in Air Passenger Duty, higher interest rates and good weather. If 
the market continues to be soft into the winter, he said the airline would move some of its aircraft from Stansted to 
its mainland European bases. O'Leary also said the company expects the European Commission to block its 
takeover of Aer Lingus in the next two weeks, and he reiterated that if that is the case, Ryanair will appeal. 'We will 
be appealing to the European courts what is clearly a political decision taken by the EU to appease the Irish 
government,' he said.

Lingus fell.
Body
The Dublin market closed in the red for the second day running today as shares in Ireland's two biggest airlines 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus hit heavy turbulence.
Shares in Ryanair fell after it today launched yet another seat sale in a bid to combat what it referred to as 
'continuing softness in the market'. The airline said that bookings and loads are still strong, however, yields are 
lower. Shares closed 18c lower at 4.98.
Those falls were mirrored in its rival, Aer Lingus. Shares in the former state airline slumped 10c to 2.53. Both 
airlines are currently awaiting news from the European Commission on whether to block Ryanair's takeover bid. 
The deadline for a decision is July 4, however, indications are that a ruling will be made as early as next week. 
Brussels chiefs are widely expected to block the deal on competition grounds.
 The sluggish performance by the airlines helped drag the overall ISEQ index of Irish shares down 47.15 points to 
9,596.26. Investors sentiment was hit by a lacklustre opening on Wall Street. US stocks were largely unchanged 
amid fresh fears over the economy following confirmation that new home construction fell in May. Although 
investors were expecting a decline in home construction, they appeared concerned about the Commerce 
Department report showing construction of new homes and apartments dropped by 2.1pc last month. The drop 
followed small gains in April and March and marked the steepest drop since January. The news had a negative 
effect on CRH, with shares in the building materials giant falling 44c to 36.50. Other construction shares faired 
markedly better, with Grafton ending the session 3c higher at 11.25, Kingspan up 22c to 20.50 and McInerney 
unchanged on 2.61. Housebuilder Abbey climbed 10c to 10.55. The financials put in a mixed performance. AIB 
managed modest gains, up 13c to 21.65, while Irish Life and Permanent tacked on 3c to 19.20. Elsewhere, Bank of 
Ireland slipped 7c to 15.92, while Anglo Irish Bank fell 20c to 16.00. Other movers included Thirdforce, down 4c to 
0.24, Norkom, down 3c to 2.00 and Kerry Group, down 21c to 20.50. Elan slipped 9c to 16.15, while IAWS slumped 
ISEQ down as Ryanair, Aer Lingus slump
20c to 16.38. Drinks group C and C was a notable faller after management confirmed it has commenced its share 
buy-back programme. The company that it has purchased 300,000 shares at E11.92. It has previously stated its 
intention to buy back up to E300m of shares in the coming months. Shares fell 37c to 11.56 today. Fencing and 
scaffolding firm Siteserv was one of few companies to make any decent headway, jumping 5c to 0.87. Elsewhere, 
Independent News and Media added on 8c to 3.63 after it confirmed this evening that it has bought 2.5 million of its 
own shares at a total cost of E9.1m. The share buy back will have the effect of lifting the stakes of existing 
shareholders very slightly. The company was quick to point out that the move was un-related to the current stand-
off between Sir Tony O'Reilly and Denis O'Brien.

Working weekWhat are your roles and responsibilities?I have responsibility for six countries, including Poland, our 
biggest central European market, as well as Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia. The 
network I am responsible for at the moment contains 51 routes operating from 17 central European airports and 
accounting for more than 4 million passengers each year. 
My daily duties include public relations as well as organisation of different promotions, but I also take part in 
negotiations with airports and authorities with regard to Ryanair's further expansion in central Europe as well as 
providing advice to other departments including advertising, new route development and regulatory.How has the 
introduction of low-cost routes affected passenger numbers in eastern Europe in recent years?Central and eastern 
Europe remains an undeveloped region in the European Union in terms of passenger numbers. According to the 
Civil Aviation Authority, UK airports handled 235 million passengers in 2006, with a UK population of about 60 
million, while in the same period in the biggest central European country, Poland, with 40 million inhabitants, there 
were only 14 million passengers handled by airports.There is huge potential in all new EU member countries for 
further growth and Ryanair will be a massive part of this expansion. Poland, thanks to Ryanair and a few other low-
fare airlines, remains the fastest-growing market in the world, showing an annual double-digit growth rate since the 
country joined the EU in May 2004.Does Ryanair view eastern Europe as an important area for growth?Absolutely. 
However, central and eastern European airports must understand that they have to compete one to another not 
only within one catchment area, but also with airports in places such as France, Italy and Spain. Future growth 
depends on whether the airports in this part of Europe will be delivering competitive conditions to those offered by 
airports in other markets, such as landing fees and fuel costs, which are still considerably higher than in western EU 
countries.Will the next 12 months be a period of growth, and if so, what effect will this have on the 
workforce?Ryanair will carry 52 million passengers to year-end March 2008, while continuing to offer the lowest 
fares in Europe, guaranteed, in addition to the best customer service. Ryanair currently employs 4,500 employees 
and remains a very lean organisation with the lowest ratio of employees per passenger in Europe. As the fleet 
grows, for example to 163 aircraft this year, employees will be added in line with growth, mainly in the areas of 
flightcrews 
and 
engineering.

Thomas Cook will list on the London Stock Exchange today with Thomas Middelhoff, its chairman, claiming the 
newly merged group is more resistant to aftershocks in the travel industry than its rival, Tui Travel.
The group has a head start on its rival, which will also list in London when the merger of Tui and First Choice is 
approved this year.
Both mergers were approved by the European Commission in the past six weeks, consolidating the big four 
European tour operators into two.
Thomas Cook, 52 per cent-owned by KarstadtQuelle, whose other divisions are Karstadt, the German department 
store, and the Quelle mail order business, will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 3.15bn, sales of nearly 
Pounds 9bn and 19m customers.
Tui Travel, also German-owned, will have a market value of Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.5bn, revenues of more than 
Pounds 12bn and 27m customers.
Today's listing marks the start of a new intensity in the rivalry between traditional tour operators struggling to make 
5 per cent margins and moving fast to chase consumers whose shift away from high-street tour packages to tailor-
made online purchases has revolutionised the sector.
These two big beasts face not just each other but also the heat of competition between low-cost carriers such as 
EasyJet and Ryanair and online tour companies, led by Expedia.
The two groups announced merger plans this year within weeks of each other after both Thomas Cook and My 
Travel spurned First Choice's auction for its mainstream tour package business.
Mr Middelhoff says buying the First Choice mainstream business had been a possibility. He now has the advantage 
of having dug deep into First Choice's books as part of due diligence into the business.
"This was an outcome of the process, but not an objective," he says.
Thomas Cook chief intends to travel lighter
While he had not anticipated the "copycat" merger of Tui and First Choice, he sees considerable differences 
between the two groups, describing his Thomas Cook group as "asset-light" compared with Tui Travel, which is 
planning to add 23 787s by 2013 to its fleet of aircraft.
"I think it's no secret that Thomas Cook has some reservations about being fully vertically integrated. The question 
is, where is it ending? To run a business model of a tour operator you don't have to be in airlines.
"They want to own the real estate. These are two very different models."
By being less vertically integrated, the Thomas Cook model, Mr Middelhoff suggests, is more resistant to external 
events such as the damage to tourism caused by terrorist incidents.
Jason Katz, the UBS managing director who brokered the deal in secret as the First Choice auction was ostensibly 
still live, questions whether the Tui/First Choice merger was genuinely intended.
"Tui/First Choice is reactive. Tui said, 'We don't need anything more in the UK. Peter Long (chief executive of First 
Choice) said, 'I hate mainstream.' I find it staggering that investors haven't questioned the rationale of the deal," Mr 
Katz says.
Mr Long would counter by extolling the virtues of vertical integration and its more advanced niche travel products 
and claiming Thomas Cook was less flexible than Tui Travel with too many holidays built round three-star seven- 
and 14-night packages.
"Ultimately, it's how can you participate in growth and not get stuck in one segment," says a senior executive of the 
Tui/First Choice team. "We have already started that with investment in niche travel. We will build on that in the 
long-haulsegment of the market."
Thomas Cook's immediate task is to announce next week where the Pounds 100m merger synergies will fall.
High-street closures and large job losses in the UK are expected. These savings will not be "dramatic", Mr 
Middelhoff says, but reflect what he calls "a reasonable strategy", adding: "We will have a continued uplift of our 
operation margin."
More long-term, Mr Middelhoff says the high-street outlet still has a role in his group in spite of the rapid growth in 
online and independent travel bookings.
"It is not about online versus offline, or internet versus bricks and mortar. It is what the consumer is demanding." 
Some travel products, he adds, are reliant on advice and recommendations from agents.
But he agrees that online bookings deliver better margins, citing MyTravel'sScandinavian business, 60 per cent of 
which comes from online bookings.
While the Tui group represents for Mr Middelhoff Thomas Cook's major opposition, the fight for the online customer 
is intensifying, especially with low-cost carriers and online travel companies, particularly Expedia.
Mr Middlehoff plans to expand Thomas Cook's internet offering and develop new markets in Asia and Russia.
On one thing, most in the industry agree - the customer will benefit.
"It is good news for the customer, " says Caroline Cartellieri, Expedia's UK managing director. "Nobody has 
sufficient pricing power to force up prices."

Tesco and Experian led London's leading shares to a lower close while Capita, Shire and Imperial Tobacco bucked 
the day's downward trend.
Wall Street didn't help as New York investors were put off by yet more weak US housing data and some 
unexpectedly lacklustre results from electronics retailer Best Buy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 35.68 points just before 10 am New York time, then rose 7.89 points above 
its opening average an hour later, before sinking back 14 points into the red to 13,599 as London closed.
A US-based company traded on both the New York and London Stock Exchanges, Carnival, did its bit for the FTSE 
100, though, arriving late in the afternoon on the gainers' board and quickly rising to sixth place. The shares ended 
at £25.34 up 23p.
Miami-based Carnival said its second-quarter profit rose more than expected on strong demand for European 
cruises. The cruise operator, which owns Cunard, said it had trimmed its full-year profit forecast because of higher 
fuel charges. It also said it had been forced to cut prices for its Caribbean cruises in the first half because of a drop 
in demand.
At the end of the day, the FTSE 100 was down 53.30 points to 6,721.40, while the other FTSE indices also fell. The 
250 was 130.30 points lower at 11,817.20. Volume was light with 1.7 billion shares traded in 370,546 deals.
Shares in Tesco retreated 4.87% to 434.50p after the UK's largest supermarket posted first-quarter results 
suggesting a slow down of like-for-like sales growth.
Sector peers Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury fell by 17.50p to 670p and by 2.5p to 581p respectively. William 
Morrison shares sank 3.75p to 301.25p. Experian was the FTSE's second-biggest decliner, losing 16.50p to close 
at 604p.
It was followed by British Airways, sucked lower in a downdraft earlier in the day when Ryanair Holdings chief 
executive Michael O'Leary told a press conference that he foresaw a 'big downturn' in the airline industry in the 
coming months, and announced that Ryanair would slash fares to compensate. BA shares lost 16.5p to close at 
424.50p, down 2.6%, while Ryanair sank 0.19 or 3.68% to 4.98.
Tuesday Closing Market: Carnival cruises in too late to save FTSE
Cadbury Schweppes was another decliner, losing 6p to close at 700.50p after unveiling its strategy for selling its 
beverages unit and refashioning itself through job cuts and plant closures. The shares rose slightly at first, but then 
fell back.
Capita Group, the London-based back-office services provider, was the day's biggest blue chip gainer, adding 
12.50p to close at 746p after Citigroup upgraded its recommendation to buy.
Shire, the Basingstoke pharmaceuticals company, was next, adding 20p to close at £12.21, followed by Imperial 
Tobacco, up 31p to £22.40.
A positive comment on the mining sector by Credit Suisse was thought to be behind a rise in the price of mining 
shares like Rio Tinto, Antofagasta, Lonmin and BHP Billiton.
Shares in ICI, which have risen sharply in recent days on bid talk, gained another 4.5p a share to close at 639p as 
investors wait to hear whether Dutch rival Akzo Nobel will increase its offer or another company bid.
Over on the second tier, Ashmore Group, Hochschild Mining and Assura Group led the decliners, while HMV was, 
for once, the day's top gainer, adding 2.75p to close at 118p.
Balfour Beatty rose 9p to 451p after Panmure Gordon upgraded its recommendation to buy from sell and raised its 
target to 500p from 425p.
The German stock market was flat, while in Paris, the CAC-40 ended the session 15.48 points lower at 6,071.67.
Sterling was stronger against both the dollar and the euro, rising to $1.9886 from $1.9836, and to 1.4816 from 
1.4781.

The Dublin market slumped heavily in the early trading today, with shares in C and C, Aer Lingus and Ryanair all 
weighing heavy.
Just after 1230 in Dublin, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 67.80 points to 9,575.61.
Drinks group C and C was a notable faller in the early stages after management at the company this week began its 
share buy-back programme. The firm said today that it has purchased 300,000 shares at E11.92. The company has 
stated its intention of buying back up to E300m of shares in the coming months. Shares were down 38c to 11.55 
today.
 The two airlines suffered modest falls, with Aer Lingus slipping 2pc, or 5c, to 2.58 and Ryanair falling 18c to 4.98. 
Elsewhere, financial shares were trading sluggishly, with AIB down 1c to 21.51, Bank of Ireland down 10c to 15.90 
and Anglo Irish Bank 8c lower at 16.12. Irish Life and Permanent was down 15c to 19.00. Other notable movers this 
morning included CRH, down 44c to 36.51, Calyx, down 15c to 1.30, Elan, down 33c to 15.91, and Paddy Power, 
down 10c to 23.10. Smurfit Kappa was one of few stocks to make any decent headway, jumping 15c to 19.38.

For three decades, Concorde was the transport of choice for high-flyers doing business between London and New 
York. When the supersonic service ended in 2003, the premium cabins of British Airways and the other major 
carriers took up the slack. But in the past 18 months, a new option has emerged for the 450,000 or so premium 
passengers a year who commute between the world's financial capitals but are not quite in the Falcon, Gulfstream 
or Global league: business-only airlines.So far, three all-premium scheduled carriers have entered the US-UK 
market. Eos Airlines, Maxjet Airways and Silverjet have different aircraft, cabin layouts, business models and 
ambitions. What they all promise customers is personal space on board and, by avoiding Heathrow and Gatwick, a 
faster, less stressful on-ground experience in the UK than the network airlines - helped by not having to share the 
boarding and deplaning with 200 or more economy passengers.The impact of Eos, Maxjet and Silverjet on the 
world's most lucrative premium air travel market is not yet causing the airline giants to lose sleep. 
Between them, the business-only operators carry just a few hundred passengers a day. Neither can they offer the 
connections and alliance benefits the major carriers can. But they all say they have a growing customer base and 
plan to expand their route network.Stansted-based Maxjet already serves Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Washington 
Dulles as well as New York. Eos, also based in Stansted, intends to launch New York to Paris next year and Luton-
based Silverjet is looking at Chicago and Miami, India and South Africa.Their arrival on the market comes as 
Europe and the USA prepare to put into effect the Open Skies agreement, which will allow carriers from either side 
of the Atlantic to offer services to and from any European Union airport. British Airways, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic 
Airways all say they are planning to launch routes to the US from continental cities in the next one to three years, 
with BA and Virgin looking at all-business class services. Recently, KLM and Swiss International Air Lines started 
their own all-business transatlantic services from airports in their home countries, operated by PrivatAir and based 
on a successful model launched in 2002 by the Swiss charter specialist and Lufthansa. PioneerPrivatAir is the 
pioneer of the all-business transatlantic sector. Originally an in-house flight department for the Latsis Group, the 
Zurich-based carrier branched into third-party VIP charter in the 1990s with three Boeing Business Jets (BBJ), 
before looking for a way of "applying the low cost model to the high yield market", says Paul de Salis, who joined 
the company from Virgin Express as head of scheduled services. It approached some of Europe's flag carriers with 
the concept of an all-business, single-aisle transatlantic service. "We discussed various models, and we finally 
settled on a partnership model with Lufthansa doing the connectivity, distribution and network, which would be hard 
No Headline In Original
for us to do as a small carrier," says de Salis.PrivatAir and Lufthansa launched their Dusseldorf to New York 
Newark service with one 48-seat BBJ1, later replacing it with an A319LR, with another A319LR flying from 
Dusseldorf to Chicago (a hub for Lufthansa's Star Alliance partner United Airlines). The BBJ was moved onto 
another new route, Munich to Newark. By this time, other carriers were getting interested and in 2005 PrivatAir 
launched Zurich to Newark with Swiss, this time using a 56-seat 737-800-based BBJ2. Later that year, a deal with 
KLM saw Amsterdam to Houston join the portfolio, with a BBJ1.Wet-leasingPrivatAir leases the aircraft, then 
effectively wet-leases them to the airlines - branded in PrivatAir colours. It provides the crew, catering and in-flight 
entertainment (hand-held modules), handles the maintenance and takes on all the operational risk. The airline 
markets the service and sells the tickets. "Selling aircraft seats is not something we have ever done. The strength of 
a global carrier is its distribution and network," says de Salis. In the past five years, PrivatAir has completed 13,000 
scheduled flights and is now making 60 Atlantic crossings a week. Ironically for PrivatAir, the more successful a 
route becomes, the more likely the airline is to replace its narrowbody service with a widebody, retaining the 
premium passengers but adding economy seats to top up revenues. However, de Salis says PrivatAir is unfazed 
about the possibility: "It's something we would be positive about. As the market grows to when the narrowbody can 
be swapped for a widebody, we can move to another route."US-owned Eos was the first all-business carrier to start 
out of the UK, launching its New York Kennedy service from Stansted in October 2005. It offers a very different 
service to its two main competitors in that its four Boeing 757-200s have just 48 flatbed seats in a "staggered" two-
plus-two configuration (Maxjet and Silverjet fly 767s with around 100 seats), giving each passenger 1.95m2 (21ft2) 
of "personal space", says Toby Joseph, executive vice president global sales. Pricier and more exclusive than its 
rivals, it is pitched firmly at the corporate market in the financial services industry. "Eighty percent of our passengers 
are corporate travellers," says Joseph. The aircraft were sourced from Mexicana and outfitted by Evergreen Air 
Center in the USA. Their average age is 12 years.Eos - whose chief executive is former American Airlines 
executive Jack Williams - now crosses the Atlantic 32 times a week with up to three departures a day. Each flight is 
70% full - "well within our business plan", says Joseph. A fifth 757 is on order and the airline is looking to add two 
more over the next 18 months, by which time it plans to be operating a Paris-New York service. LIMO SERVICEThe 
carrier makes great play of its easy connection to London's City financial centre - its regular passengers qualify for 
a limo service others are given free tickets for the Stansted Express train service - and there is a 45-minute check 
in, with passengers escorted through security to a dedicated lounge. "Stansted has been a huge factor. It means 
our boarding experience is totally different. We've taken away the crowds," says Joseph.A month after Eos 
launched, it was joined at London's third airport by Washington Dulles-based Maxjet. "We came up with the concept 
of an all-business class carrier with affordable fares," says chief executive Bill Stockbridge. Unlike Eos's emphasis 
on corporate clients used to travelling business and first class with regular airlines, Maxjet has gone after a hybrid 
business-leisure market of passengers tempted by British Airways' or Virgin Atlantic's World Traveller Plus or 
Premium Economy cabins. The airline, which posted $41 million revenues in its first year of operation and last week 
floated on London's Alternative Investment Market (AIM), has gone for a spread of routes rather than single-route 
frequency. It flies six times a week to New York Kennedy, four times each to Los Angeles and Washington DC and 
three times to Las Vegas (rising to four in September), and offers fares from $1,500. "As a low-fare, all-business-
class airline, a lot of what we are trying to do is persuade people out of economy with an extra level of service," 
says Stockbridge. Maxjet operates five 767-200ERs - each with 102 "traditional business class leather seats", 
offering a 60in (152cm) pitch and reclining to 170?. Like Eos, it offers passengers portable DVD players with in-
flight movies. Its leased aircraft are older than Eos's - "late 1980s vintage" - and have been sourced from Qantas, 
ILFC, Kuwait Airways and Air Mauritius, and converted by Alitalia Engineering & Maintenance, Shannon Aerospace 
and Evergreen. Stockbridge says the airline's aim is "slow controlled growth", with the possibility of new routes from 
Stansted, including another US West Coast city, Florida, Dubai and Johannesburg.newcomerSilverjet is the 
newcomer of the trio: it launched daily flights from London Luton to New York Newark in January 2007. It has just 
taken delivery of its second 767-200, also configured with 100 flatbed seats, and now offers morning and afternoon 
westward flights, with 19:30h and 22:00h departures back to the UK. Its business model is not very different to 
Maxjet's in that it does not directly target the corporate account market. Founder and chief executive Lawrence 
Hunt says he came up with the idea for an all-premium carrier after spending 20 years travelling the world when he 
ran small businesses in the travel and technology sectors. "When I flew, I had the choice of paying out of my own 
pocket ?500 ($986) on economy or ?4,000 ($7,890) on business," he says. "We ran through some models, looking 
at what happens when you strip out economy. We believed we could offer fares at under ?1,000 ($1,973), aiming at 
SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] and the affluent leisure market."Hunt had looked at financing and 
No Headline In Original
decided he did not want an "outsider owning 70% of my business and interfering with the design of headrests and 
cabin crew uniforms". Instead he raised ?25 million ($49 million) on the AIM in May 2006, another ?26 million from 
a further share offering, and acquired a small airline, Flyjet, to obtain an air operators certificate. With load factors 
above 60% and rising, he says he has the funds in place to "see us through to 10 aircraft in three years" and plans 
to launch services to US cities including Chicago, Miami and Los Angeles, as well as to India and South 
Africa.Small is betterLike his colleagues at Eos and Maxjet, Hunt believes using a smaller UK airport makes sense. 
"Luton has been enormously creative and supportive. It means we can offer a 30-minute check in and can take all 
the irritable things out of flying long haul," he says. Another unique selling point, the company believes, is its ratio of 
one cabin crew member to 10 passengers.All the new entrants to the market are convinced that the transatlantic 
business market is far from saturated. "There are 28 New York flights a day out of London alone," says Hunt. 
"There is still a lot of scope for growth." Joseph says that with the transatlantic premium market expanding by 10% 
a year, there is "plenty of room for new players". It is a view that the new players' established rivals seem to agree 
with. "We haven't seen any impact at all," Virgin's director of external affairs Barry Humphreys recently told Flight 
International's sister magazine Airline Business Daily. "At the moment our [premium cabin] load factor is at record 
levels."Open Skies should see an expansion of the market on the Continent too. "It's a huge opportunity for carriers 
to go into markets that have been forbidden to them," says PrivatAir's de Salis. "We are going to see a lot of 
carriers going into another carrier's hub and creaming off premium traffic in point-to-point, low capacity routes. 
We've been waiting for this to happen since we started in 2001." premier upstartsmurdo morrison londonA new type

The Dublin market ended a sluggish session virtually unchanged today as investors paused for breath following last 
week's three-day rally.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 16.21 points lower at 9,643.41. 
Having traded modestly higher for much of the session, investors backed off late in the day following a lacklustre 
opening on Wall Street.
 Today marked the introduction of free-float methodology for the calculation of indices on the Irish Stock Exchange. 
The changes had little evident effect on trading. Bank of Ireland was a notable faller in the financial sector, sinking 
20c to 15.95, while AIB fell 11c to 21.51. Irish Life and Permanent was largely unchanged, up 1c to 19.20, while 
Anglo Irish Bank fell 1c to 16.21. Shares in Anglo Irish have fallen over 10pc during the last two weeks on the back 
of a sharp rise in long term bond yields. The construction sector put in a mixed performance. Shares in CRH fell 19c 
to 36.76 despite new figures suggesting that total construction output in key European markets is likely to increase 
this year. Estimates from Euroconstruct forecast that total construction output is now expected to rise by 2.4pc this 
year and by 1.8pc in 2008. This is up from the December 2006 estimates of 2.2pc for 2007 and 1.5pc for 2008. 
Davy Stockbrokers said the forecasts confirm the continued strength of CRH's key European construction markets. 
"Construction output estimates have increased in the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Poland, all countries 
where CRH has large operations," Davy analyst, Robert Gardiner, said."With these European operations 
contributing 46pc of group operating profit, the improved construction output forecasts are a clear positive for CRH". 
Elsewhere, McInerney closed 5c higher at 2.51, while Kingspan jumped 20c to 20.45 and Grafton ended the 
session unchanged at 11.20. Housebuilder Abbey slumped 7c to 10.45. Other notable movers today included 
security software group Norkom, up 10c to 2.08, bookmaker Paddy Power, up 32c to 23.13 and airline Ryanair, up 
6c to 5.17. Elsewhere, drug maker Elan again hit fresh 5-week highs, jumping 2pc, or 40c, to 16.24. Shares in the 
company soared by over 12pc last week as investors buy in on a potential windfall from the new Alzheimer's drug 
ISEQ largely unchanged as banks slip
that it is developing with Wyeth. Meanwhile, shares in outsourcing group Newcourt moved sharply higher, up 3pc, 
or 5c, to 1.60. The company is currently waiting to find out whether it has won a E100m Government contract to 
operate up to 600 speed cameras around Ireland. Newcourt, along with its tender partner, the Australian Tenix 
Corporation, was confirmed as one of six finalists last week. The remaining six bidders now have until July 24 to 
submit their tender documents. Goodbody predicts that the contract could generate profits of up to E1m a year for 
Newcourt. Regardless of this potential contract win, Goodbody is forecasting earnings growth of 16.4pc for 
Newcourt in 2007. Leading the fallers was drinks group CandC, down 15c to 11.79, while Calyx plummeted 10pc, or 
15c, to 1.30 and IAWS fell 35c to 16.55. Iona Technologies dropped 20c to 3.80, with UTV down 25c to 5.75 and 
Independent News and Media, down 15c to 3.55. Property group Blackrock International slumped 9pc, or 5c, to 
0.51.

The honeymoon may be over US AIRLINES
The honeymoon may be over US AIRLINES

The briefest of honeymoons may already be over for the US airline industry, quite a feat for a sector without even a 
marriage to celebrate.
No sooner had the industry chalked up its first profitable year since 2000 than executives started offering gloomy 
predictions of emerging overcapacity as, forthe first time in five years, all of the major carriers operated outside of 
bankruptcy protection.
"The big surprise was that there was any surprise," says Doug Parker, chairman and chief executive of US Airways. 
The majors, reinvigorated with lower cost structures won through the courts, are no longer shrinking, while domestic 
low-cost carriers (LCCs) continue their own expansion, leaving capacity broadly flat after five years of shrinkage.
Mr Parker emerged as the US industry's defining figure over the past two years, first combining his America West 
with a bankrupt US Airways and then launching an audacious bid to create the world's largest airline by acquiring 
Delta Air Lines.
Delta fought off the bid, but the move triggered a frenzy of talks between the network carriers and set the scene for 
another push towards consolidation, either during the next cycle or when antitrust regulators signal such moves 
would win approval.
"I still think seats need to come out," says Mr Parker of the domestic market. The seats have stopped coming out, 
at least in the domestic market, and are being quickly added in the international arena as network carriers flex the 
advantage of their newly lowered costs against overseas rivals.
The majors have survived another cycle without a liquidation, and their lower cost structures have tempered the 
relentless march of the LCCs, some of whom are now suffering growing pains of their own. JetBlue's operational 
problems triggered a political debate over passenger rights, forcing the industry to fight a potentially unpopular 
battle against a so-called "bill of rights".
"The network carriers have found a cost structure and a revenue situation that appears to be sustainable," says 
Andrew Watterson at Oliver Wyman, though the pre-tax margin of just 1 per cent forecast for the industry this year 
remains paltry in terms of the capital needed for fleet replacement.
The honeymoon may be over US AIRLINES
After five years of relentless focus on cost reduction - exacerbated by a rise in fuel costs which many executives 
now view as structural - US carriers are switching more attention to the revenue side in a bid to improve profitability.
Even Southwest, for so long the poster-child of US aviation with its 60 quarters of unbroken profitability, plans its 
own "transformation", borrowing a few ideas from Ryanair and Easyjet. Southwest plans to boost non-flying sales, 
encouraging passengers to book hotels and hire cars through its website, and experimenting with assigned seating 
and inflight entertainment.
Mr Watterson notes that while US carriers have lagged behind international rivals in "customer-facing" issues - such 
as lie-flat beds on longhaul routes - they have continued to innovate on the cost side. Measures include more 
efficient flight planning to save fuel and improve utilisation and deal with chronic congestion, as well as baggage 
handling systems - the rate of lost baggage is half the level seen in Europe.
The network carriers are boosting international capa-city while keeping domestic flying flat. Routes to Europe, Latin 
America and, above all, Asia, are experiencing double-digit percentage gains in traffic and yields to offset the return 
of weakening conditions at home.
Not that the domestic market has prevented the arrival of new entrants such as Skybus, a Ryanair clone, and the 
expected arrival of Virgin America after more than a year in regulatory limbo.
The international push has been helped by some breakthroughs in the cats-cradle of international treaties which 
govern the global aviation industry, notably the open skies deal between the US and the European Union, and a 
doubling of capacity on routes to China. The arrival of longer-range aircraft is also affording the chance to tap 
markets such as India and the Middle East with direct services.
With the domestic market under control, despite the doom-mongering, and financial markets keen to underwrite 
international expansion, the biggest question mark for US airline executives remains their ability to manage labour 
relations.
Successive boom cycles have turned to bust with labour deals the industry was unable to afford. Labour groups 
have started to intensify their campaign to "share the gain" of profitability after their wage and benefit cuts in effect 
kept network carriers out of liquidation.
The head of the largest pilots' union warns that US airline passengers face a summer of cancellations and delays.
John Prater, the new president of the Air Line Pilots' Association, says carriers had cut too many staff and stretched 
working rules to the limit over the past five years, with some flight crew working 12- to 16-hour days.
"We have pilots that are far too tired to command aircraft," says Mr Prater.

From Mr Andrew Gowers.
Sir, While endorsing Michael O'Leary's sentiments about the horrors of BAA's "monopoly airports" (Letters, June 
15), am I alone in finding such criticism somewhat hypocritical coming from the head of an airline with as cavalier 
an attitude to its own customers as Ryanair frequently displays?
A recent encounter by my family with Mr O'Leary's "On-time airline" casts an ironic light on his protests against the 
poor passenger experience at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Ryanair was supposed to fly us to Treviso for 
Venice, but our plane was diverted by a storm and we landed at Trieste.
Then the fun started. The airport was closed and bleary-eyed police and customs officers had to be summoned 
from their homes to deal with us. Contrary to pre-landing assurances from the crew, there was no transport, 
accommodation or refreshments for the arriving refugees. More entertainingly still, once we were ensconced out of 
sight in the airport building, the Ryanair crew simply disappeared, never to be seen again. Thus 184 passengers 
including elderly, infirm and infants, were left to fend for themselves in the middle of nowhere through the small 
hours of the morning.
According to the Air Transport Users Council, airlines have a contractual duty to get passengers to the destination 
they paid for at no extra cost. Can anybody explain why an airline that so flagrantly and insouciantly violates its 
obligations to customers should continue to have a licence to fly?

Airline traffic at Charleroi airport returned to normal Monday after a strike left thousands of travelers stranded over 
the weekend, officials said.
Security staff at Belgium's second largest airport started their strike Friday morning, but agreed late Saturday to 
suspend labor action until Tuesday.
Unions and management are scheduled to negotiate Tuesday on the proposed privatization of security operations 
at airports. Unions object to the move from the public to the private sector.
Budget airline Ryanair, which uses Charleroi as a hub, scrapped all weekend flights out of the airport.
"Everything is back to normal and we do not anticipate problems," Ryanair spokesman David Gering told VRT 
network.

A strike at Charleroi Airport, a major hub for Ryanair, has ended and services are starting to get back to normal.
Charleroi, near Brussels, is Ryanair's Belgium destination and the airline has not yet announced when it will resume

Earlier this weekend, Ryanair warned customers that its flights to Charleroi had been cancelled.
 Security staff at Charleroi Airport walked off the job yesterday in a dispute over privatisation. Last night, they

A decision to force airlines in to the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) could see billions wiped off the

ETS will force airlines to pay to offset carbon emissions with, according to a report by Ernst and Young, a cost of 
more than E5.5 billion.
EU transport ministers have now agreed on a joint position supporting emissions trading for the airline sector, a

From Mr Michael O'Leary.
Sir, Philip Stephens ("Put an end to the Heathrow misery", June 12) correctly describes the passenger experience 
at Heathrow as a nightmare. Sadly it is no better at the other BAA monopoly airports at Gatwick and Stansted.
These appalling and badly run facilities are further depressing proof of the abject failure of the Civil Avation 
Authority's regulatory regime in the UK. Any system that rewards a monopoly by setting its income as a fixed 
percentage of its capital expenditure is bound to incentivise that monopoly to waste not millions, but billions, on 
capital expenditure in order to inflate its future income.
Mr Stephens also correctly identifies the solution. Competition. The only way the London airports can be improved 
is for the Competition Commission to force the break-up of BAA's London airport monopoly. Spin out Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted into three separately owned companies and force them to compete vigorously against each 
other. Competition will deliver more efficient investment, passenger-friendly terminal facilities, lower costs and 
improved services. Put an end to the regulatory scandal that allows the BAA monopoly at Stansted to contemplate 
wasting Pounds 4bn on a second runway and terminal, when these facilities can and should be built for less than a 
quarter of that sum.
The BAA airport monopoly has not delivered for passengers. Albania provides more efficient terminal facilities than 
the BAA monopoly. Ryanair welcomes Mr Stephens' support for our campaign to break up this overspending, 
overcharging airport monopoly.

Unions protested plans to privatize security, saying it could raise costs and cut staff.
Unions and management were expected to meet on Friday.
Charleroi is Belgium's second most important airport and is home to budget airlines like Ryanair. A strike was 
announced for mid-afternoon, but it began at dawn, leaving thousands of people stranded at the busy start of a long 
weekend. By midmorning, workers at nearby Liege airport had joined the walkout.
Brussels international airport at Zaventem was not affected and was able to accept the redirected traffic.

Airport operator Fraport AG said Thursday that traffic at its six airports in May rose a combined 3.6 percent from last 
year, with growth at its flagship facility in Frankfurt slowing to about half a percent.
The company said the softer increase at Frankfurt International Airport was expected, given that last year's figures 
were boosted by early arrivals to Germany ahead of soccer's World Cup tournament.
For the month, though, the total number of passengers flying in and out of its airports in Germany, Peru, Bulgaria 
and Turkey reached 6.36 million. Airports with big gains included Frankfurt-Hahn, a base for Ryanair, which saw 
passengers increase by 10.3 percent to 358,632 from last year and Lima Airport in Peru, which reported 603,706 
travelers, up 29.7 percent.
In Frankfurt, 4.6 million passengers flew in and out of Europe's third-busiest airport, up 0.6 percent from a year ago, 
driven in part by flights to classic vacation destinations in the Caribbean, North Africa and Turkey, along with an 
increase to flights to the U.S. which rose 7.3 percent.
The group's cargo business also rose 2.1 percent to 197,865 metric tons (218,108 tons) from last year.
Shares of Fraport were up more than 1.7 percent to €51.98 (US$69.07) in Frankfurt.

British low-cost airline easyJet unveiled a model of an "ecoJet" on Thursday, saying that, when built, the planes 
would emit half the carbon dioxide of those now in use.
Chief Executive Andy Harrison said the technology to build the aircraft already existed, and his company was in 
talks with manufacturers to get it delivered by 2015.
"This is not 'Star Trek.' This is the future," Harrison said. "If it were to be made available today, we would order 
hundreds of them for fleet replacement."
Lower speeds, the use of weight-reducing materials, and rotors fitted to the back of the plane would all act to 
improve fuel efficiency and reduce pollution cutting carbon emissions by 50 percent and nitrogen by 75 percent, 
easyJet said. The new plane would also be quieter than previous models.
The aviation industry, which accounts for about 2 percent of the world's carbon emissions, has come under 
increasing pressure from environmental campaigners, and airline companies have been racing to burnish their 
green credentials.
Some, like British Airways, offer customers the chance to fund environmental projects to offset the emissions 
created by their trip, while others such as Virgin Atlantic are investing in new forms of biofuel.
European low-cost leader Ryanair says its fleet of Boeing 737-800s have already cut carbon emissions and fuel 
consumption in half since 2000.

SAS Scandinavian, the airline partly owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, is to sell its 
stakes in a range of European airlines, including BMI British Midland, marking the end of its ambitions to become a 
pan-European carrier.
It said yesterday it would offload its 95 per cent stake in Spanair, the Spanish airline, its 20 per cent stake in BMI, 
the UK carrier, its 37.5 per cent of Air Greenland, and consider selling its ground, technical service and cargo units.
The asset disposal programme comes amid intense competitive pressures from low-cost airlines such as Ryanair, 
the effects of which were compounded by a series of damaging strikes at SAS since the beginning of the year.
"The competitive situation in aviation is changing at a rapid pace. A growing number of airlines are putting pressure 
on airfares for both leisure and business travel," said Mats Jansson, chief executive.
"SAS is to concentrate on its core business - flying to, from and within Northern Europe," he added. He emphasised 
the need for the airline and its unions to put aside their differences.
"A new co-operation model with the unions will be established. We have to abandon the strike culture that has long 
existed at SAS," he said.
The company offloaded the SAS Flight Academy in February and its Rezidor hotel business in November and said 
yesterday it was also considering the sale of SAS Ground Services, SAS Technical Services and its cargo handling 
business.
Spanair is Spain's second-largest airline by market share, but still lags well behind Iberia, the former state-owned 
flag carrier.
The sale of Spanair comes amid intensifying competition in the Euros 5.5bn (Dollars 7.3bn) Spanish market, fuelled 
by the surge in new capacity.

Marsans, the Spanish travel group, is reportedly among possible bidders for Spanair.

Body
Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus will almost certainly be blocked by the European Commission later this month, after 
Brussels found a combination of Europe's biggest low-cost airline and Ireland's flag carrier would undermine 
competition and harm consumers.
The Commission still has until July 4 to finalise its decision, but it has drafted and circulated a ruling prohibiting the 
deal.
According to several people familiar with the case, the Brussels-based watchdog on Monday presented its draft 
decision to national competition regulators, who backed the Commission's findings.
This means the Commission is now set on a course towards blocking the deal and a decision is expected to be 
announced on June 27. Until then, however, Ryanair has the theoretical chance of swaying the antitrust regulator's 
opinion, for example by offering to give up further slots to ensure competition on routes currently served by both 
carriers.
Though it is very rare for the Commission to change its mind at this late stage, some observers point out that 
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, is a more likely candidate than most to spring last-minute surprise on 
Brussels.
This would be the first merger prohibition by Brussels since December 2004, when Neelie Kroes, the EU 
competition commissioner, blocked a merger between Portugal's dominant gas and electricity suppliers.
In recent years, the Commission has become increasingly reluctant to ban mergers outright, instead preferring to 
impose tough conditions on contentious deals, such as asset disposals.
In the case of Ryanair, the no-frills carrier had offered to sell take-off and landing slots on a number of routes where 
it competes directly with Aer Lingus.
Ryanair 's move on Aer Lingus set to fail
However, both the Commission and the rival companies consulted ultimately rejected Ryanair's concessions as 
insufficient.
Even a Commission clearance decision would not have guaranteed the success of Ryanair's approach, because 
the Irish government and several other Aer Lingus shareholders -- which together account for more than 40 per 
cent of votes - remain opposed to the takeover.
Should the Commission block the deal, the decision would open the door to a second Brussels ruling forcing 
Ryanair to sell its current25 per cent holding in Aer Lingus.
Such a move would require a new investigation and any formal push to get Ryanair to sell its stake would most 
likely take several months.
A spokesman for Ryanair yesterday declined to comment on the case. However, Mr O'Leary has said repeatedly 
that he would appeal against any decision to block the Aer Lingus takeover.
The European Commission also declined to comment.

No-frills airline Ryanair carried more international passengers than any other airline last year, according to official 
figures.
Ryanair said the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) world airline passenger statistics for 2006 showed 
40,532,000 cross-border passengers flew with it during the year, nearly 2,300,000 more than its nearest rival, 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG, which carried 38,236,000 passengers.

The commercial flight simulator industry is going through one of its periodic technology shifts. Whereas previous 
cycles have emphasised performance, the driver this time is definitely cost.Electric motion bases and visual 
systems combining commercial graphics processors and liquid-crystal projectors are sweeping the market, offering 
lower purchase and operating costs. The Level D full-flight simulator (FFS) is still the industry standard, but there is 
a growing market for a lower-level, but still high-fidelity, device tailored to recurrent training.Montreal-based 
Mechtronix Systems has championed the concept of the modern "non-zero flight-time" full-motion machine. These 
lower-cost type-specific devices can be certificated to Level B for recurrent training, but offer similar standards of 
technology and fidelity to the tail-specific Level D simulators required for zero flight-time initial training. After 
delivering its first such device to Panama's Copa Airlines, Mechtronix received the "stamp of approval" of an order 
from Lufthansa Flight Training, which placed the Boeing Next Generation 737 simulator into service in Berlin in April 
following European Level B approval. 
LFT is using it for customer TUIfly.A further endorsement of the concept came in March, when market leader CAE 
launched its 5000 Series simulator aimed at the narrowbody-airliner recurrent training market and focused on the 
needs of low-cost airlines and third-party training providers. The Canadian manufacturer has so far announced 
orders for eight such devices: five 737NGs for Ryanair, a 737NG and a Bombardier Q400 for LFT and Embraer 
Phenom 100 and 3000 business-jet simulators for CAE's training joint-venture with the aircraft manufacturer.The 
CAE 5000 is a standardised device with smaller and simpler motion and visual systems to reduce footprint and 
costs, and is 20-30% cheaper than CAE's latest customised, tail-specific, 7000 Series simulator, says Marc Parent, 
group president, simulation products. The key to airline acceptance is to reduce cost without sacrificing training 
quality, Parent says, and the new Level B device runs the same software as a Level D simulator.What the industry 
is waiting for is the regulatory environment to catch up with the technology and allow airlines to get training credit for 
using the complete range of devices available, from desktop trainers to Level D simulators. New regulations would 
codify the greater training value of a modern "non-zero flight time" simulator compared with a traditional Level B 
machine. "Level B has been in existence a long time and no-one has done anything with it," says Parent. "Hopefully 
the regulations will catch up soon."Sales of these next-generation Level B machines have helped boost the market 
over the last 18 months. Manufacturer-supplied data indicates that orders for 51 full-flight simulators were placed 
last year, up from 35 last year and 24 in 2005. This year is off to a strong start, with orders for 21 simulators 
Technology shift
announced to the end of May. Like others in the air transport industry, CAE's Parent believes the market is in an 
extended up cycle based on order backlogs at Airbus and Boeing that stretch out for several years at projected 
production rates.Simulators for Airbus and Boeing types account for 43 of the orders placed last year and 18 so far 
this year, with the bulk - 29 and 11 respectively - being for Boeing aircraft. Narrowbody airliners make up the 
majority of orders as low-cost carriers in Europe and airlines in China and India continue to expand rapidly. The 
2006 total includes 21 simulators for the 737NG and 11 for the Airbus A320 family, plus five for the A320 and two 
for the 737NG this year.The year to date total includes two FFSs for the Boeing 757 - a narrowbody type now out of 
production. CAE has not identified the customer, but it could be US cargo carrier FedEx Express, which shelved an 
order with the Canadian manufacturer for two Airbus A380 simulators when it cancelled its order for the widebody 
freighter. FedEx is acquiring 90 757s to replace its Boeing 727s.747-8 freighterIn 2006 CAE sold a Boeing 747-400 
freighter FFS to US cargo carrier UPS Airlines, which has also cancelled its order for A380 freighters because of 
delays. In May, CAE announced the first sale of a simulator for the new 747-8 freighter, to Japan's Nippon Cargo 
Airlines.Boeing types - led by the new 787 - make up the bulk of 11 simulator orders in 2006 and 11 this year for 
widebodies. Boeing training subsidiary Alteon followed up its 2005 launch order with Thales for six 787 training 
suites with the 2006 purchase of three more, while CAE won its first orders for 787 FFSs - one for China Eastern 
and two each for Japan Airlines and Qantas.Delays to A380 deliveries depressed the market for simulators for the 
ultra-large airliner, with only one order placed in 2006 - by Lufthansa with Thales - and none so far this year. 
Boeing's 777 continues to do well, however, accounting for four simulator orders in 2006 and three so far this year - 
split 5:2 between CAE and Thales. Rounding out the widebody market were two FFS orders for the Airbus 
A330/A340 in 2006 and another two so far this year - all with CAE.Sales of regional airliner simulators have ebbed 
in recent years as the North American industry has stagnated, but there is resurgence in emerging markets and - 
mirroring that for the aircraft themselves - the demand is for turboprops. The eight regional airliner FFSs sold in 
2006 include three for the ATR 42/72, with another being booked this year - by Spain's Indra making one of its 
occasional civil simulator sales, this time to Spanish centre Global Training Aviation. Embraer marketCAE sold a 
Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 FFS to Lufthansa earlier this year and Embraer's E-170/190 large regional jet family 
continues to generate simulator sales: one by CAE in 2006 to Flight Training Finance for use by Panama's Copa 
Airlines, and one by FlightSafety International this year to Australian low-cost carrier Virgin Blue.Rounding out the 
regional market were two key "first of type" deals signed in 2006. Thales was selected to supply three training 
suites for the Sukhoi Superjet100, formerly the Russian Regional Jet, while CAE struck a deal to build the first FFS 
for China's large regional jet, the ARJ21, under development by AVIC I Commercial Aircraft. The Superjet100 is 
scheduled to fly this year, and the ARJ21 in 2008, and their manufacturers want the simulators ready for training 
before deliveries begin.Geographically, the market unfolded much as expected. European customers accounted for 
almost half the simulator orders in 2006, with the big buyers being low-cost carrier Ryanair (six 737NGs from CAE) 
and independent training centre FSC in Amsterdam (three A320s and four 737NGs from CAE). Lufthansa Flight 
Training ordered an A320 from CAE, the A380 from Thales and a 737NG from Mechtronix, adding the Q400 this 
year. Turkish Airlines ordered a Thales A320.China and India delivered on their promise as rapidly growing markets 
for training. Indian customers accounted for seven simulator sales in 2006 and four so far this year. CAE's haul 
includes an A320 and ATR 72-500 for Air Deccan and an A330/A340 and 777-300ER for Jet Airways. Thales 
booked two A320s and an ATR 42/72 for Kingfisher, and earlier this year announced a deal with new Indian training 
centre Rudradev Aviation for four FFSs: A320, A330, 737NG and 777-300ER.Sales to identified Chinese operators 
tallied up to six in 2006 and four so far this year. CAE sold a 777-300ER to Cathay Pacific, the 787 to China 
Eastern, an A320 to Shanghai Eastern Flight Training and an A320, A330 and 737NG to its Zuhai Flight Training 
Centre joint venture with China Southern. Thales booked two 737NGs for Sichuan Airlines. Overall, the wider Asia-
Pacific region edged ahead, with a total of nine sales in 2006 and eight (to identified customers) so far this year. 
Airlines in North and South America continued to be relatively insignificant buyers, accounting for just three 
simulator orders in 2006 (a 737NG for Continental, a 777-300ER for Air Canada and the E-170/190 for Copa, all 
with CAE) and none so far this year. But Parent says there are signs the US market is picking up.Independent 
training centres continue to account for a significant slice of simulator sales. In 2006, as well as FSC's expansion, 
Alteon ordered a 737NG and 777 from Thales (plus the extra 787 FFSs). Alpha Aviation Group secured a 737NG 
from Sim-Industries for its Bond Aviation Solutions centre in the UK and an A320 from CAE for its Clark Aviation 
centre in the Philippines, while Sabena Flight Academy ordered a 737NG FFS, also from Sim-Industries.Tallying up 
the data supplied by manufacturers gives CAE 28 FFS orders for 2006, and Thales 16. CAE says is has booked 15 
orders this year, while Thales has its Rudradev deal. The bullish market gives more opportunity for other 
Technology shift
manufacturers, and 2006 saw Canada's Mechtronix book orders for four FFSs, Sim-Industries of the Netherlands 
book two and FlightSafety make one external sale, to Alteon.The outlook is optimistic. "I think orders will continue at 
the current pace," says Parent. "Aircraft are being delivered and they require training." Narrowbody airliner 
simulators like this Thales-built Airbus A320 account for two-thirds of total ordersHydraulic motion bases are giving 
way to electric systems that are easier to install and maintain

(ANSA) - Comiso (Ragusa), June 12 - Italian airport operator Societa dall Aeroporto di Comiso (So.A.Co.) which 
manages the Pio La Torre airport in Comiso, on the southern Italian island of Sicily, appointed Pietro Ivan 
Maravigna, 43, CEO.
Ugo Costanzo, Francesco Di Blasi, Francesco Tanasi, Giuseppe Tumino, Orlando Lombardi, Clotilde Dibennardo 
and Nicola Radici were confirmed in the board of directors of the airport operator.
Ivan Maravigna graduated from the Catania University in Sicily and is a member of the international research 
society for public management IRSPM. The new CEO of So.A.Co. was municpal councillor of Catania until 2005.
According to Ivan Maravigna, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair is interested in the Comiso airport, because it is still 
present in Eastern Sicily.
Notes
Ryanair launched on September 14, 2006 flights from the Trapani/Birgi Airport on the southern Italian island of 
Sicily, to Pisa, central Italy, at prices starting from 1.99 euro ($2.65 excluding taxes, ANSA reported on March 28, 
2006. From Pisa passengers have the opportunity to fly, again with Ryanair, to 17 international destinations.)

Body
Financial shares were the big winners today as the Dublin market got itself back on track following last week's 
heavy losses.
The ISEQ plummeted by over 6pc last week, wiping around E7bn off the value of Irish shares.
Fears over inflation and rising interest rates were cited as the main reasons for the falls, while other pointed to 
continuing uncertainty over the domestic property market.
 AIB was one of the hardest hit by the slump, falling by 12pc. Investors moved back in today, however, with shares 
in the institution closing 29c higher at 21.27. Elsewhere in the sector, Bank of Ireland added on 30c to 15.60, while 
Irish Life and Permanent jumped 30c to 19.50. Anglo Irish Bank bucked the trend, slipping 3c to 16.32. The overall 
ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 96.79 points higher at 9,478.61. A string of trading updates this week could see 
the market pick up even further. Qualceram Shires, Fyffes and Independent News and Media are all due to hold 
their AGM's in the coming days, with all three likely to provide an update on trading in the year so far. Investors will 
also be keeping a close eye on technology firm Norkom, which is due to publish its full year results for 2007 later 
today. Goodbody analyst Gerry Hennigan is forecasting revenues of E24.6m, EBITDA of E3.3m and fully diluted 
earnings per share of 3.4c. Such a revenue outcome would represent growth of 36pc. Shares in the firm were down 
3c at 1.95 this evening. CRH led the way in the construction sector following reports over the weekend that the 
building materials giant is set to snap up German business Dywidag Systems International for around E1bn. The 
Munich-based firm makes steel tension supports used in the construction of coal mines. Dywidag, which is 
expected to post sales of around E700m this year, is being sold by Swedish private equity firm Industri Kapital. 
Shares in CRH were up 36c to 35.94 on the news. Other construction equities were mixed, with Grafton up 19c to 
11.31, McInerney down 4c to 2.51 and Abbey unchanged on 10.31. Kingspan slumped 76c to 20.14. Elsewhere on 
the market, drinks group C and C was a notable mover, up 21c to 11.41, while airline Ryanair jumped 14c to 4.98 
and paper packaging firm Smurfit Kappa added 21c to close at 19.02. Pharmaceutical giant continued its recent

strong run, soaring over 5pc, or 72c, to 14.62. Bookmaker Paddy Power tacked on 23c to 21.91, Siteserv fell 4c to 
0.82, while United Drug jumped 10c to 4.05. The ISEQ's newest recruit, First Derivatives, slipped back on profit 
taking following last week's successful floatation. The software provider has grown at a significant pace over recent 
times and has been tipped for big things by several analysts. Having been listed in London since April 2002, 
Goodbody said its listing in Dublin will result in "an improved profile and better liquidity for the company". Shares in 
the firm slipped 18c to 4.52 in Dublin today.

Boeing sees crucial role for airframe

Boeing expects airframe technology will play as crucial a role as new clean-burning engines in developing a 
replacement for its best-selling 737, providing a potential advantage over Airbus in the race to design the next 
generation of single-aisle aircraft.
The two rivals are developing replacements for their 737 and A320 familes, which are the workhorses of global 
airline fleets and account for half of the Dollars 3,200bn in aircraft deliveries forecast between now and 2025.
Engine manufacturers are struggling to develop new power plants to meet ever more exacting efficiency standards, 
as well as tighter emission and environmental demands. Over the past two decades, in contrast, improvements in 
engine technology have led the way in developing quieter, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
Boeing now believes the new airframe technology, using composite carbon-fibre pioneered on its 787 widebody jet, 
will be just as important as the engines. The 787 is due to enter service next year but the 737 and A320 
replacements are not expected before the middle of the next decade at theearliest.
"I think the introduction of composites has raised the ability of the airframe to make a difference . . . and really puts 
it on a par with the engine development," said Jim McNerney, chairman and chief executive of Boeing.
Boeing and its partners in the 787 programme already have an advantage over Airbus in building airframes using 
composites, which replace most of the traditional aluminium structures. The materials are lighter and more durable, 
and can be assembled faster.
Airbus plans to use composites in its proposed A350XWB widebody, but that jet it is not due to enter service until 
2013, five years after the 787.
Mr McNerney admitted in an interview with the Financial Times that the American company had yet to finalise the 
transfer of the 787 technology to developing a replacement for the 737, the world's best-selling commercial aircraft.
Boeing sees crucial role for airframe
The FT revealed last year that Boeing was working with key 737 customers including Southwest, Ryanair and Gol 
on the replacement, dubbed the 797. "I think the market knows what it wants," said Mr McNerney, pointing to a 20-
25 per cent improvement in the operating costs and environmental footprint compared with the existing 737 family.
"The technology component will be slightly different than for the 787. We haven't totally figured that out," he said.

Cadbury Schweppes and Centrica helped set a brisk pace as London leaders started the week in a bright mood, 
partly because of the 157-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial index on Wall Street last Friday.
The drinks-to-confectionary giant added 17.25p to 699.25p on reports that it is planning to sell its Butterkist popcorn 
brand, while Centrica advanced 7.25p to 366.75p after the Russian giant Gazprom reiterated its interest in a UK 
acquisition. The other likely target, BG Group, added 10p to 775p, but later fell back to 769.75p.
Broker Bridgewell says Rexam's US deal with Owen Illinois Plastic Products proves that the UK group is 
determined to be as big a global player in rigid plastic as it is in cans, but it remains neutral on the shares which 
were at the top of the loser board with a 16.5p fall to 495p, down 3.23%. Evolution Securities is another Rexam 
buyer.
Following Arun Sarin's positive US road show and 'encouraging guidance' for 2008, Lehmann Brothers is 
overweight on Vodafone, but a run of profit taking saw the shares ease 2p to 157.9p, making it the second largest 
loser of the session so far.
Deutsche Bank warns clients about the risks of being short or underweight in Enterprise Inns, 12.75p better at 
700.25p. Although it is not yet known whether the UK tax authorities will allow the pub estate to become a real 
estate investment trust, Deutsche is a buyer of the shares. It says they could bounce by between 150-200p.
Morgan Stanley recommends that investors buy Tesco on weakness. It has a target price of 490p and says while 
small, the recommended offer for Dobbies Garden Centres indicates Tesco's ability to 'sustain its UK growth 
profile'. The shares added 7.375p to 445.625p.
Dresdner Kleinwort believes there is still an upside risk on the guidance from drinks giant Diageo, up 7.75p to 
£10.5475, whose financial year ends on 30 June. It says the guidance will either be raised in the year-end trading 
statement or the results due in August will be stronger than expected.
Prices were marked sharply higher as the market opened and managed to advance further. The FTSE 100 peaked 
at 11:09am up 54.1 points at 6,559.2. At 12:42pm the FTSE 100 was 38.4 points ahead at 6,543.5.
The other key indices also moved higher with the FTSE 250 recovering last week's two heavy losses with a 42.1 
gain to 11,625.3. Volume was below average with just 821 million shares changing hands in 186,824 deals.
Monday Lunchtime Market: Deal talk puts a pop into the FTSE
Citigroup is a buyer of Ryanair, 0.09 higher at 4.965, and says the sell-off that has wiped 24% of the share value 
since disappointing traffic figures were released on 3 May has been overdone.
The broker says the group has plenty of growth opportunities in southern and eastern Europe, adding that the long-
term growth prospects and business model of the group remain strong.
Anglo-US jewellery group Signet, down 1.626p to 108.625p, suffered after negative broker comment from Lehman 
Brothers and Deutsche Bank which has downgraded the shares from buy to hold.
Following the surprise sale of the Whelan family stakes, Numis is a seller of JJB Sports, 7.75p better at 257.125p, 
despite the bid speculation triggered by the deal. It thinks the shares will approach the 275p Whelan sale price, but 
struggles 'to make the financials work' for a private take out at these levels.
Stock exchange newcomer PV Crystalox Solar, a renewable energy company, saw its shares rise from the offer 
price of 130p to 137.5p.
Wall Street is expected to be flat in early trading with the absence of any significant economic data leaving it will 
little direction beyond the increasing concern about rising global interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial index is 
expected to slip around three points to 13,654.4 in early dealing.
The Frankfurt market bounced back from last week's losses, largely because of Wall Street's positive end to last 
week. At 12:42pm the German DAX-30 was up 81.48 points to 7,671.98 with Thyssenkrupp, Lufthansa and 
Deutsche Boerse the biggest early winners.
Paris shares moved in a similar way for the same reason. At 12:18pm the French CAC-40 was 46.85 points higher 
at 5,930.14. Vallourec and Societe Generale were among the notable winners.
Sterling was softer against the US dollar, although the rate moved within narrow limits, as fears of an early hike in 
UK interest rates retreated. The pound eased to $1.9669 from $1.9674. At 1.4737 the pound was firm against the 
euro which finished last week at 1.4727.

Shares in Dublin made a positive start to the week, with the ISEQ index soaring by more than 1pc following last 
week's heavy losses.
Just before 1300, the ISEQ was up 105.56 points to 9,487.38.
Fears over inflation and rising interest rates led to almost E6bn being wiped off the value of Irish shares last week.

Body
Should, as is likely, the EU formally block Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus, then Aer Lingus would consider buying back 
the shares owned by the no-frills airline, according to industry sources.
Aer Lingus chief executive, Dermot Mannion said over the weekend that he would be prepared to sit down with 
Ryanair and listen to their suggestions.
Ryanair spent E345m acquiring its 25.5pc shareholding in Aer Lingus as it mounted an abortive bid for the airline 
last year.
 The EU's competition commission is due to deliver its verdict soon with many in the industry speculating that it will 
reject the proposal on competition grounds.

Telecoms
Vodafone became embroiled in a dispute over its capital structure and the future of its minority stake in Verizon 
Wireless, the second largest US mobile phone operator. Efficient Capital Structures, backed by John Mayo, former 
Marconi chief executive designate, succeeded in getting four resolutions on to the agenda at next month's annual 
meeting. Vodafone urged shareholders to reject the proposals. While many remain sceptical about ECS's chances 
of success, some leading investors have sparked debate about the management's overall strategy.
Gas & Water
Private equity houses and pension funds are poised to be among the bidders for Southern Water, supplier to Kent, 
Sussex and Hampshire, which has been put up for sale at Pounds 4bn.
Kelda, the owner of Yorkshire Water, confirmed it was in the running to buy Thames Water's services division, 
which is being sold by Australia's Macquarie Bank.
Severn Trent focused on its identity as a water company with a management restructuring that will see Colin 
Matthews, chief executive, replaced by Tony Wray, managing director of the water division.
Travel & Leisure
British Airways paid nearly Pounds 360,000 to cover the cost of Martin George's legal defence against allegations 
of price fixing and an investigation by the OFT, which prompted his resignation in October.
Virgin Atlantic looked to turn up the competition in the transatlantic market as it planned to launch a business-only 
service connecting European and US cities. The move followed a similar pledge last month by British Airways.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, warned profitability would rise only 5 per cent in the coming year as 
tougher trading conditions force it to cut fares.
THE WEEK - Philip Stafford
InterContinental Hotels was thrust back into the bid spotlight after it emerged that the Barclay brothers had 
increased their stake to 10 per cent.
Mike Ashley, the sportswear billionaire was poised to take control of Newcastle United after winning over the club's 
owner Freddy Shepherd. The Pounds 133m takeover appeared to be going ahead after Mr Shepherd accepted the 
100p-a-share offer from Mr Ashley, giving the founder of Sports Direct International a near-70 per cent stake.
Real Estate
Segro, formerly Slough Estates, has sold its Californian life sciences property business for Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 
1.5bn) in the final stage of its drive to shed non-core assets.
The Pounds 2bn flotation of Vector, Britain's first hotel-based real estate investment trust, was pulled because of 
rocky market conditions, even though its backers cut the launch price in the run-up to flotation. The move was a 
setback for Richard Balfour-Lynn, the property entrepreneur who staked his credibility on the venture.
Support Services
Balfour Beatty won a series of contracts in the US worth a total of Pounds 1bn, including the construction of a 
prison in New England and housing at the West Point military academy.
The news came as itsought to offset bad news from Metronet, the consortium refurbishing two-thirds of the London 
Underground.
However, the market for contracts remained buoyant as Amec and Jarvis offloaded problematic parts of their 
businesses.
Amec sold most of its construction contracts and its urban regeneration unit to Morgan Sindall for Pounds 26m, in 
effect ridding itself of its most troublesome unit. Jarvis, meanwhile, sold four lossmaking contracts relating to private 
finance initiatives to the Secondary Market Infrastructure Fund.
General Retailers
DSG International moved swiftly to appoint John Browett, the man behind the success of Tesco.com, as chief 
executive to replace the retiring John Clare. Mr Browett as yet has no firm date for his arrival.
Russell Hardy departed as chief executive of Blacks Leisure following a boardroom clash over the strategic 
direction of the outdoor leisure retailer. The weather became his bugbear as he blamed global warming for poor 
trading.
General Financial
Simon Nixon, 39-year old co-founder and chief executive of Moneysupermarket.com, has bought out his former 
partner's shares for Pounds 162m in a move that paves the way for a flotation of the price-comparison website

For summer dining perfection, barbecuing is out - at least, if you're British. Remember Brillat-Savarin's maxim: "On 
devient cuisinier mais on nait rotisseur" (one can learn to cook but one has to be born a rotisseur).
Having ruled out burnt offerings for dinner, the decision then is whether to eat in or eat out. If the former, choose a 
do-ahead, foolproof menu. The perfect summer dinner will feature a judicious mix of both hot and cold elements. 
Plunge first into a blood-red, iced gazpacho served in tumblers, topped with alternating crunchy layers of chopped 
egg white, diced green pepper, purple onion and pale cucumber divested of skin and seeds.
Consider next a salad of duck breasts, pinkly roasted, cooled, thinly sliced and splayed out on your best big white 
plate with a salad of crunchy-cooked green asparagus domed up in the middle. With the salad comes the warm 
element, a tatin of new potatoes. The scrubbed but resolutely unpeeled tubers are arranged in a cake tin, liberally 
splashed with olive oil, imprisoned beneath a thick layer of herby, salty dough and baked for an hour or so. Later, 
with a flourish and to an accompanying roll of drums, you will invert them for serving when they will be revealed in 
all their golden, fragrant, tatin-esque glory.
To conclude your perfect summer dinner, try a tiramisuofsoft summer fruits, a sinfully smooth confection in which 
mascarpone, sugar and eggs play significant parts, layered with Creme de Cassis-imbibed sponge fingers and 
speckled with the first raspberries, strawberries and currants red and black - the whole thing is a cut above the 
usual coffee and powdered chocolate combo and more grown-up than trifle.
But then again, you might yawn and decide to eat out instead. You could do worse than to invest some of your 
hard-earned Netjet flight hours and take off for a taste of chef Lionel Levy's irreverent summer cooking right on the 
water in Marseille at Une Table, Au Sud. Brace yourself for his deconstructed milkshake de bouille-abaisse: garlicky 
potatoes, fish, foaming rouille layered in a glass, to be sucked noisily through a fat straw. Bouillabaisse will never be 
quite the same again.
Alternatively, in more egalitarian vein, hop on a Ryanair to Biarritz on the Atlantic coast and settle down for dinner at 
the delicious, art nouveau Grand Hotel in neighbouring, pastel-shaded St Jean de Luz. Chef Nicolas Masse's 
tartare of tuna served in a Parmesan cone with a cucumber sorbet is a nightmare to eat tidily but it feels just right 
THE LIST SUE STYLE'S TIPS FOR THE PERFECT SUMMER DINNER
for summer at the seaside. If Brittany is more your thing, the lobster feast at the Hotel de la Plage in Sainte-Anne-
La-Palud in Finistere's Crozon peninsula is hard to equal. You'll be equipped with a huge apron and all the 
weaponry necessary to tackle this formidable crustacean, the ne plus ultra of perfect summer dining. At around

Highlight: Banks dragged the ISEQ lower in Dublin trading today.
Body
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 49.25 points lower at 9,381.82 - taking its losses for the week to almost 600 
points.
Fears over inflation and rising interest rates have weighed heavy on the minds of investors all week, leading to 
almost E6bn being wiped off the total value of Irish shares. 
Shares had been down by as much as 150 points earlier the session yesterday, however, a bright opening on Wall 
Street inspired a modest rally in Dublin.
 US stocks moved higher, helped by a narrowing of the US trade gap and soothing comments from a Federal 
Reserve official. The Commerce Department reported that the gap narrowed by 6.2pc to USD58.5bn in April, after 
widening to a six-month high of USD63.9bn in March. Comments from Chicago Federal Reserve President Michael 
Moskow, in an interview with CNBC, also helped to soothe the market. Moskow said inflation expectations are well 
contained and the current benchmark interest rate is appropriate for now. Back in Dublin, AIB was a notable faller in 
a sluggish financial sector, falling 13c to 2104, while Anglo Irish Bank slumped 28c to 1635 and Irish Life & 
Permanent slipped 7c to 1885. Bank of Ireland bucked the negative trend, tacking on 10c to 1530. Greencore was 
one of few other stocks to make any significant headway, rising 6c to 5.03, amid speculation that property 
developer Liam Carroll is ready to mount a bid for the company. The tycoon is reported to be interested in acquiring 
Greencore's large land bank in Mallow and Carlow, following the closure of the sugar industry in Ireland last year. It 
has been speculated in recent days that Mr Carroll has returned to the market for Greencore shares this week, his 
first foray since he spent E170m last summer buying up the entirety of the 21.57pc stake held for years by 
billionaire investor Dermot Desmond. Market talk speculates that Mr Carroll would likely sell off the food business 
and concentrate on developing its property assets. In the construction sector, CRH was virtually unchanged 
yesterday, down 2c to 3558, while Grafton added on 19c to 1115 and Kingspan slumped 35c to 2090. 
Housebuilders Abbey also struggled, 19c to 1031, while McInerney rose 10c to 1400. Other notable movers

included pharmaceutical group Elan, down nearly 3pc, or 35c, to 1390, business support services group DCC down 
26c to 2346, and food group IAWS down 20c to 1630. Shares in no frills airline Ryanair continued their recent 
struggle, falling 2.5pc, or 12c, to 486, while Aer Lingus was flat on 275. Food group Kerry ended the session 21c 
lower at 2065. The company confirmed yesterday that it had snapped up just over one and a half million A Ordinary 
Shares of its own stock. It said it had purchased the 1,596,400 A Ordinary Shares. The highest price paid for these 
shares was E20.90 and the lowest price paid was E20.80, it said in a note to the Iris Stock Exchange. All of these A 
Ordinary Shares repurchased will be cancelled, it said.

Body
The Dublin market's miserable week continued today amid fresh worries over interest rates.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 44.60 points lower at 9,431.07, taking its falls for the week to almost 6pc.
Major bourses around the world have been hit hard in recent days after the European Central Bank raised its 
interest rates for the eighth time since December 2005 and hinted that more can be expected before the end of the 
year.
 Leading Irish shares moved modestly higher earlier in the session, however, a slow start on Wall Street saw the 
market fall back into negative territory. Leading U.S. stocks slipped back for a third straight session after rising bond 
yields stoked concerns that an interest rate cut later in the year is less likely. With rates rising in the market, the 
Federal Reserve is expected to be less inclined to cut short-term interest rates, dealers said. Meanwhile, a dip in 
applications for unemployment benefits last week, which indicates a healthy labour market, also made a rate cut 
seem less likely. Investor sentiment in Dublin was also hit after the bank of England decided to keep rates 
unchanged at 5.5pc, but upped the risk of a further hike by the end of the year. The Royal Institute of Chartered 
Surveyors voiced concern that rates may reach 6pc by the end of the year. Inflation concerns weighed heavy on 
financial shares with Anglo Irish bank down 39c to 16.63, AIB down 1c to 21.17 and Irish Life and Permanent down 
10c to 18.87. Bank of Ireland managed slight gains, tacking on 5c to 15.20. Shares in CRH put in a sluggish 
performance, down 35c to 35.60, while Kingspan lost 8c to 21.20 and McInerney fell 3c to 2.59. Grafton ended the 
session down 13c at 10.97. Ryanair continues to be something of a turn-off for investors after it this week warned 
that profits are only likely to grow by around 5pc in the current financial year. Shares in the no frills carrier closed 3c 
lower at 4.97 last night. Aer Lingus added on 2c to 2.75. Elan was one of few major equities to make any decent 
headway, jumping 37c to 14.32, while ferries operator Irish Continental Group soared an impressive 72c to 20.80. 
Bookmaker Paddy Power also closed in the black, up 23c to 21.68, after it confirmed on Wednesday that it has 
purchased and cancelled a further 1.4pc of its outstanding share capital. This follows the two recent cancellations 
ISEQ down for third session running
totalling 2.8pc. Goodbody estimates that Paddy Power will have net cash of around E70m by the end of 2007. 
Elsewhere on the market, FBD Holdings was a notable faller, down 4p, or 162c, to 34.48 after its shares went ex-
dividend on Wednesday. Food group IAWS slipped 5pc, or 89c, to 16.60, while Independent News and Media fell 
6c to 3.60 and Qualceram Shires slumped 13c to 2.02. The bathroom furnishings firm is due to issue a trading 
update at its AGM next Tuesday.

European equities were sharply lower yesterday as concerns over higher borrowing costs in the eurozone 
encouraged profit taking in consumer industries.
The European Central Bank, as widely expected, lifted eurozone interest rates by a quarter -point to 4 per cent. 
While bank president Jean-Claude Trichet described rates as still "on the accommodative side", stocks were driven 
lower by concerns that more tightening is to come. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 slipped 1.6 per cent to 1,586.45.
Leisure industries were badly hit by expectations that higher interest rates would curb consumer spending. For a 
second day in a row, airline stocks were lower, after a study suggested the cost to the industry of joining the 
European Union's emissions trading scheme would be Euros 9.8bn-Euros 45bn between 2011 and 2022. Air 
France-KLM fell 3.7 per cent to Euros 35.40, while Lufthansa shed 3.6 per cent to Euros 20.12.
Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, was Tuesday's biggest loser after the company warned that recent interest rate 
increases in the UK would have a damaging impact on profit growth this year. The stock dipped just 0.4 per cent to 
Euros 5.02 yesterday, after a number of brokers said they considered recent share weakness a buying opportunity.
The prospect of a wider slowdown in consumer spending also hurt retailers. Swedish fashion chain H&M fell 1.6 per 
cent to Euros 430, while Spanish rival Inditex lost 3.8 per cent to Euros 44.20. Carmakers were faced with fears that 
raised borrowing costs could deter consumers from big-ticket purchases that require financing. France's Renault fell 
4 per cent to Euros 108.88, while Italy's Fiat fell 3.6 per cent to Euros 20.18.
Interest rate concerns also hit Spanish property and construction company's - sectors that have already been 
undermined this year by Spain's housing slowdown. Sacyr Vallehermoso fell 5.3 per cent to Euros 38.53 in spite of 
its announcement that it had been awarded a Euros 124m motorway maintenance contract. Rival Acciona shed 4.9 
per cent to Euros 191.45, while FCC slid 4.1 per cent to Euros 69.70.

The Dublin market managed to arrest its recent slide this morning following two black days in which over E5bn has 
been wiped off the value of Irish shares.
Just after 1100 today the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 27.85 points to 9,503.52.
Financial shares staged a slight recovery from their heavy falls this week, with AIB up 17c to 21.35, Irish Life and 
Permanent up 22c to 19.20 and Bank of Ireland up 15c to 15.30. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 9c to 16.93.
 Elan was one of the morning session's star performers, jumping 3pc, or 32c, to 14.27. Meanwhile, airline Ryanair 
tacked on 8c to 5.08, while Aer Lingus jumped 4c to 2.77 and Blackrock climbed 1c to 0.50. The news was not all 
good in Dublin, with red numbers continuing to dominate the board. CRH was one of the most notable fallers, down 
70c to 35.25, while insurance group FBD Holdings fell 4pc, or 160c, to 34.50 after it went ex-dividend yesterday. 
Kerry Group slipped 16c to 20.74, with Qualceram Shires down 13c to 2.02 and UTV down 13c to 6.00.

(ANSA) - Forli, June 7 - The passenger traffic at the Ridolfi airport in Forli, northern Italy, increased by 9.4 pct year-
on-year in 2006 to 618,521, the president of Italian airport operator SEAF which manages the Ridolfi airport, 
Massimo Bucci, said.
According to Bucci, Ridolfi registered a growth of 12.3 pct year-on-year of the passenger traffic in the first four 
months of 2007. SEAF sees a passenger traffic of 1.0 million in 2010, Bucci said.
The airport operator has signed a cooperation agreement with Italian low-cost air carrier Wind Jet, which means 
that many new flights will be launched. SEAF plans to sign a cooperation deal also with Irish low-cost airline 
Ryanair, Bucci added.

The province of Forli-Cesena has increased its stake in SEAF, which manages the Ridolfi airport in Forli, to 5.0 pct 
from previously held 2.65 pct, ANSA reported on September 15, 2006. The shares were bought via subscription for 
a 114,522 euro ($154,553) capital increase. In particular, the province bought 60,275 shares in SEAF at the price of

European airlines claimed Wednesday that European Union plan for a mandatory greenhouse gas cap and trading 
system would cripple the industry with extra costs of 4 billion euros ($5.41 billion) a year.
Groups representing low-cost airlines like Ryanair Holdings PLC joined major carriers such as British Airways and 
Lufthansa in saying the plan would diminish mobility, hurt the overall economy and cut off remote areas from tourist 
traffic, citing a report the airlines commissioned from global accounting group Ernst & Young and air transport 
consultants York Aviation.
Buying enough carbon permits to operate between 2011, when the program would begin, to 2022, will cost more 
than 45 billion euros ($61 billion), the airlines said.
"Airline profits would be reduced by over 40 billion euros ($54 billion) over the period to 2022," the report said. "The 
introduction of the EU emissions trading scheme will result in a reduction in consumer choice in terms of the range 
and frequency of air services."
European airlines said they are committed to a trading system to cut emissions. However, they said they will ask 
EU lawmakers and governments to consider a higher limit for the carbon trading cap, as the current level based on 
2004-2006 emissions does not take into account growth in the industry before the program would be initiated in 
2011.
Because of stiff competition, airlines say they would be unable to pass costs on to customers, which would in turn 
prohibit investment in new routes and technology. It could also quash up to 42,000 new jobs needed to handle 
anticipated industry growth, the airlines said.
Europeans have been flying greater numbers in recent years as low-fare, short-haul airlines pushed ticket prices 
downward.
European airlines reject EU emissions cap plan, warn of threat to profits, jobs
As more people fly, the European Union has committed itself to cutting overall levels of carbon dioxide by 20 
percent by 2020. Regulators say the cap-and-trade program would accomplish that without damaging the economy.
The trading program gives airlines a financial incentive to reduce emissions because they can sell allowances that 
they don't use. But if they fail to use low-carbon technology or increase their flights, airlines will be forced to buy 
additional allowances for carbon dioxide.
Although aviation contributes only 1.5 percent of all EU greenhouse gas emissions, the industry is growing rapidly 
by 5 percent a year by turnover.
The EU executive wants the program to cover all airlines that fly within or to Europe.
U.S. officials have warned that applying the system to non-EU airlines may be against international aviation rules.

Ireland 's Aer Lingus doubling long-haul fleet with big Airbus purchase

Aer Lingus will buy 12 Airbus jets, including the new A350 XWB, to modernize its long-haul fleet and expand 
service to the United States, the Irish airline said Wednesday.
The deal provided a welcome boost for struggling Airbus ahead of the Paris Air Show later this month. It also 
demonstrated Aer Lingus' confidence of defeating a takeover bid by Dublin-based rival Ryanair, which had pledged 
to ax the airline's trans-Atlantic services.
Aer Lingus Group PLC said it will receive six new A330-300E aircraft from 2009 to 2011, then six A350 XWB 
aircraft from 2014 to 2016. The airline which already operates an all-Airbus fleet of 30 short-haul A320s and eight 
A330s also negotiated options to buy six more A350s for delivery by 2018.
The deal has a catalog value of $2.4 billion (1.78 billion euros), but Aer Lingus said it negotiated substantial 
discounts.
Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said the airline negotiated with Airbus' U.S. rival Boeing Co. for the possible 
purchase of its new 787 long-haul jet. But he said Airbus offered "an exceptional price" and that he believed Airbus 
was "better on fuel and better on range" than the Boeing 787.
Directors of Aer Lingus, a previously state-controlled airline that was floated on the British and Irish stock 
exchanges in September, made the purchase of new long-haul aircraft its top priority for growth.
Aer Lingus already flies to New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. Later this year it plans to resume service 
to Washington and Orlando, Florida, and launch a new service to San Francisco.
Aer Lingus shut down its Washington services after the Sept. 11 attacks and canceled lucrative Orlando services in 
January 2006 because of a union dispute.
Mannion said Aer Lingus planned to open more U.S. routes by 2009, but might target new continents as well.

"We will prioritize the U.S. ... (but) we have an eye as to what's happening to the Far East and South Africa," he 
said.
Aer Lingus shares fell 2.5 percent to 2.73 euros ($3.68) Wednesday on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Wednesday's deal is subject to shareholder approval.
The announcement came as Airbus parent, European Aeronautics Defence and Space NV, prepared this week to 
introduce a large-scale restructuring plan that would require major job cuts.
Ryanair says it remains committed to acquiring Aer Lingus, although its bid has been on hold since December and 
appears unlikely to receive regulatory approval from the European Union on July 4.
Ryanair currently owns 25.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares. Those opposed to the Ryanair bid include the Irish 
government, which holds a 25 percent share, and Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that hold more than 15 
percent.

European airlines claimed Wednesday that the European Union's plan to make them join a greenhouse gas cap-
and-trade system would cripple them with extra costs of €4 billion (US$5.4 billion) a year, wiping out potential future 
profits and growth.
Citing a report they ordered from global accounting group Ernst & Young and air transport consultants York 
Aviation, groups representing low-cost airlines such as Ryanair Holdings PLC and major carriers like British Airways 
PLC and Lufthansa AG said the current plan would kill off Europe's mobility, hurting the overall economy and 
cutting off remote areas from tourist traffic.
Forcing them to buy enough carbon permits to fly all the passengers they expect from 2011 to 2022 would cost 
more than €45 billion (US$61 billion), the airlines said. This figure does not include extra costs if more permits were 
auctioned instead of given to companies for free as they are currently.
"Airline profits would be reduced by over €40 billion (US$54 billion) over the period to 2022," the report said. "The 
introduction of the EU emissions trading scheme will result in a reduction in consumer choice in terms of the range 
and frequency of air services. We expect that regions and regional airports would be particularly affected."
The European airlines said they still were committed to a trading system as the least-bad system to cut emissions. 
However, they said they would ask EU lawmakers and governments to consider a higher basic limit for the carbon 
trading cap, as the current level based on 2004-2006 emissions does not take into account fast growth in the 
industry before the program would start in 2011.
They are fiercely opposed to extra taxes, the other main policy tool that forces companies and consumers to cut 
their contribution to global warming.
Tougher competition within the sector meant they would not be able to pass on more than a third of costs to 
customers, airlines said, meaning that companies would have to absorb most of the costs themselves.
European airlines reject EU emissions cap plan, warn of threat to profits, jobs
They said this would prevent them investing in new routes and technology and would stop them hiring up to 42,000 
people in new jobs they expect to create as the sector booms.
Europeans have been taking to the skies in greater numbers in recent years as the rise of low-fare short-haul 
airlines caused ticket prices to crash, encouraging people to travel more to new vacation spots and second homes 
in parts of the bloc far away from major city hubs.
But more travel means releasing more of the carbon dioxide that causes climate change. The European Union has 
committed itself to cutting overall levels by 20 percent by 2020, claiming that a cap-and-trade program would help 
this happen without damaging the economy.
The trading program gives airlines a financial incentive to reduce emissions because they can sell allowances that 
they don't use. But if they fail to turn to low-carbon technology or increase their flights, they will be forced to buy 
additional allowances to release more carbon dioxide.
While electricity generators can turn to wind or solar and lightbulbs can become more efficient, aircraft have few 
alternatives to high-quality gasoline.
Although it only contributes 1.5 percent of all EU greenhouse gas emissions, aviation is growing rapidly by 5 
percent a year by turnover. Its emissions may also be worse for climate change because they are released high into 
the atmosphere where they may cause more damage.
The EU executive wants the program to cover all airlines that fly within or to Europe. U.S. officials have warned that 
applying the system to non-EU airlines may be against international aviation rules.

Another E2.5bn was wiped off the value of Irish shares today as the ISEQ index crashed by almost 2.5pc for the 
second consecutive day.
The ISEQ closed 240.32 points lower at 9,475.67.
The heavy losses mean that almost E5bn has been erased from the value of investors' holdings since Tuesday.
 Investors are becoming increasingly concerned about rising inflation both at home and abroad, which is likely to 
mean yet more interest rate hikes. Yesterday's Today's sell off sell-off came as European Central Bank president, 
Jean Claude Trichet, failed to signal whether the current rate hiking cycle is yet at an end. The central bank lifted its 
key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4pc, as expected. Investor sentiment in Dublin also received 
a blow from across the Atlantic as inflationary concerns again reared their ugly head in the U.S. New figures from 
the Labour Department showed that unit labour costs rose at a higher than expected rate in the first quarter. The 
readings did little to alleviate investor concerns that the inflation-wary Federal Reserve might lean toward raising 
rather than lowering rates later this year. Back in Dublin, inflation fears ensured that financial shares endured a 
torrid time. Despite the release of a positive trading update today, shares in AIB fell 61c to 2118. The bank re-
iterated previous forecasts for low double-digit percentage growth in its earnings in 2007. Elsewhere in the banking 
sector, Bank of Ireland slipped 45c to 1515, while Anglo Irish Bank lost 37c to end the session at 1702. Irish Life & 
Permanent slumped by more than 4pc, or 84c, to 1898 after new figures from the Irish Bankers Federation revealed 
a 19pc drop in the number of mortgages taken out during the first three months of the year. Insurance group FBD 
Holdings was another notable faller, down a massive 12pc, or 500c, to 3450 as its shares went ex-dividend. 
Meanwhile, drinks group C&C fell 60c to 1130. Positive passenger figures and acquisition news failed to lift Aer 
Lingus, with shares in the airline slipping 7c to 273. The former state carrier reported a 3.9pc rise in passenger 
traffic during May and confirmed that it is to purchase a total of 12 new planes. Ryanair put in another sluggish

performance after it this week warned of a marked slowdown in 2006/2007 earnings. The airline cautioned that it 
could experience its first quarterly losses in its 10-year history as a listed company in the third and fourth quarters of 
the current year. The forecast led to a massive sell-off in the company, with shares falling by over 7pc on Tuesday. 
Investors were still steering well clear today, with shares closing another 2c lower at 502. Elsewhere, paper and 
packaging firm Smurfit Kappa slumped 60c to 1889, while fencing and scaffolding firm Siteserv fell 6c to 085. CRH 
was down 55c to 3595, Kingspan lost 77c to 2108 and Elan fell 21c to 1395.

The Dublin market's miserable start to the week continued this morning with the ISEQ index falling by a further 1pc.
Just after 1000, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 112.57 points to 9,603.42.
Today's sluggish opening comes after the index slumped by 2.5pc yesterday, wiping almost E3bn off the value of 
Irish shares.
 The falls came on the back of a cautious outlook from Ryanair and concern over today's meeting of the European 
Central Bank. It is almost certain that the ECB will hike rates to 4pc - their highest level in six years. The financials 
were notable lower ahead of the meeting, with Anglo Irish Bank down 38c to 17.05, Bank of Ireland down 53c to 
15.20 and Irish Life and Permanent down 45c to 19.39. Shares in AIB fell 51c to 21.28, as investors await a trading 
statement from the institution later on today. Ryanair made a modest recovery this morning following yesterday's 
near 8pc decline, tacking on 6c to 5.10. Aer Lingus continued to struggle, however, falling 1c to 2.75, after it today 
announced a 5.2pc rise in passenger numbers during May and a 1pc increase in total load factor. FBD Holdings 
was the biggest faller, down 9pc, or 371c, to 35.75 as its shares today went ex-dividend. Elsewhere, CRH was 
down 15c to 36.35, while Irish Continental Group slipped 92c to 20.08 and Readymix fell 14c to 2.66. UTV was 
down 16c to 6.13.

European airlines were hit yesterday after a warning from Ryanair over the dangers to the sector from rising interest 
rates.
Ireland's low-cost carrier reported a better than ex-pected 33 per cent rise in full-year net profit, thanks to 17 per 
cent passenger growth. But that was where the good news ended.
The shares fell 7 per cent to Euros 5.04 after the company said profit growth this year would slow to 5 per cent, 
from 33 per cent last year, as competition and slowing consumer spending forced it to lower prices.
Howard Millar, finance chief at Ryanair, said four interest rate increases in the UK were starting to have an impact 
on the whole industry as consumers changed their spending habits.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended the session 0.6 per cent lower at 1,612.13
Concerns over slowing growth in the Irish economy hit the country's financial institutions and drove the Irish Stock 
Exchange index 2.3 per cent lower.
Allied Irish Banks shed 3.3 per cent to Euros 21.79, while Anglo Irish Bank lost 1.7 per cent to end the session at 
Euros 17.23.
Investors were particularly troubled by the slowdown in the country's housing market. CRH, building materials 
group, fell 2 per cent to Euros 36.60, while Readymix, the cement maker, fell 5 per cent to Euros 2.66.
The housing malaise spread to Europe as investors nervously awaited the market debut today of Realia, a joint 
venture between Spanish construction group FCC and mortgage lender Caja Madrid.
Realia set its final offer price on Monday at Euros 6.50 a share, below the indicative price of between Euros 7.90 
and Euros 9.70.
Changing habits hurt airlines
German drugmaker Merck rose 5.5 per cent to Euros 104.28 thanks to recent successful trial results on its cancer 
drug Erbitux and expectations that it would replace pharmaceuticals rival Altana in the blue chip Xetra Dax index.
Renault, the French carmaker, gained 0.7 per cent to Euros 113.38 after Carlos Ghosn, chief executive, said the 
company was on track to meet its 2009 targets. Deutsche Bank lifted its price target from Euros 117 to Euros 144.

Last time Michael O'Leary warned of an impending "bloodbath" in the low-cost airline industry, in 2004, it never 
materialised. This time around, the Ryanair boss's language is more tempered. But he is nevertheless gloomy 
about short-term prospects. Will his pessimism be justified?
Ryanair's results for the year to March 31, announced yesterday, were more than respectable. Net income of Euros 
401m was a third higher than last year and above analysts' forecasts.
But in spite of expecting passenger numbers to continue growing strongly, Ryanair is now warning of potential 
losses this winter. Yields - average revenue per seat sold - may drop 5 per cent in 2007-08, implying a 25 per cent 
hit to profits. Although fuel costs have fallen, higher airport charges and more cabin crew per aircraft will send unit 
costs up more than 6 per cent.
Mr O'Leary has other reasons for gloom. The European Commission appears on the verge of vetoing a Ryanair 
takeover of Aer Lingus, and may even force it to sell its 25 per cent stake in the Irish carrier. The setback will not 
affect Ryanair's plans to return money to shareholders. Nor will it affect its expansion. But it is nevertheless a 
distraction for its management at a time of increasing operational challenges.
Ryanair has the strongest business model of any European airline and a balance sheet to match. Its intention to 
meet any downturn with aggressive pricing has worked in the past and may work well in the future. Nevertheless, 
the industry headwinds are building.
Weakening demand, maturing low-cost markets and aggressive competition, allied to an unfavourable regulatory 
regime in the UK and continental Europe, is not the best mix. This is not the first time Mr O'Leary has played down 
expectations. But it may be the first time he is proved right.

Ryanair, Europe' largest low-cost airline, warned profitability would grow by only5 per cent in the coming year as 
tougher trading conditions forced it to cut fares.
The airline said falling passenger yields and rising costs could drive it into loss in the last two quartersof the year, 
when services are usually less busy.The warning sparked a sell-off in the company's shares, which closed Euros 
0.42, or 7.75 per cent, lower in Dublinat Euros 5.00.
The gloomy outlook came in spite of record results at the airline, which increased both revenues and yield per 
passenger in the year to March 31. Pre-tax profits increased by 33 per cent to Euros 451m (Dollars 610m) even 
though fuel costs have risen.
Revenues increased by 32 per cent to Euros 2.24bn aided by a 22 per cent rise in passenger numbers to 42.5m.
Ryanair said it would use part of its Euros 2.2bn cash pile to buy back up to Euros 300m of shares starting later this 
week, equivalent to approximately 3.88 per cent of its share capital at yesterday's closing price.
The airline said it remained confident it would increase passenger numbers by a further 22 per cent this year to 
more than 52m but that if current soft market conditions continued, yields per passenger could fall by up to 5 per 
cent.
Combined with a projected 6-7 per cent increase in unit costs, the fall is likely to mean profit growth of about 5 per 
cent.
However, Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JP Morgan, said the low-cost carrier model was not broken and that 
tougher conditions were "temporary wobbles".

Ryanair, Europe' largest low-cost airline, warned that profitability would grow only 5 per cent in thecoming year as 
tougher trading conditions force it to cut fares.
The airline said falling passenger yields and rising costs could even drive it into loss in the last two quarters of the 
year, when services are usually less busy.
The warning sparked a sell-off in the company's shares, which closed Euros 0.42, or 7.8 per cent, lower inDublin at 
Euros 5.00.
The gloomy outlook came despite record results atthe low-cost airline, which increased both revenues and yield per 
passenger in the year to March 31.
Pre-tax profits increased 33 per cent to Euros 451m (Pounds 305m), even though fuel costs have risen sharply. 
Revenues rose 32 per cent to Euros 2.24bn (Euros 1.69bn), aided by a 22 per cent rise in passenger numbers to 
42.5m.
Ryanair said it would use part of its Euros 2.2bn cash pile to buy back up to Euros 300m of shares, starting later 
this week.
The airline remained confident it would increase passenger numbers by a further 22 per cent this year to more than 
52m, but added that if soft conditions continued, yields per passenger could fall by up to 5 per cent.
Combined with a projected 6-7 per cent increase in unit costs, the fall is likely to mean profit growth of only about 5 
per cent, with possible losses in the September-December and January-March quarters.
However, Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JPMorgan, said that the low-cost carrier model was not broken and that 
tougher conditions were "temporary wobbles".
Strong profit growth last year was driven partly by a7 per cent rise in average fares.
Ryanair warns of falling yields and rising costs
Revenues from scheduled fares rose to Euros 1.87bn (Euros 1.43bn) while ancillary revenues from items such as 
onboard food sales rose 40 per cent to Euros 362m (Euros 259m).
But some of the gains were eaten up by a 9 per cent rise in unit costs including a 50 per cent increase in fuel costs 
to Euros 693m and higher staff costs because of the increased lengths of flights it operates.
Ryanair is awaiting the result of a European Commission review of its proposed hostile takeover of Aer Lingus

Stocks Poised to Open Lower
NEW YORK (AP) Stocks pointed toward a slightly lower opening Tuesday as Wall Street cautiously awaited data on 
the nation's service sector. Investors will be examining the Institute for Supply Management's May index on non-
manufacturing industries, scheduled to be released at 10 a.m. EDT. According to the median estimate of 
economists surveyed by Thomson Financial, the market expects the index to hold steady at 56.0, the same reading 
as in April.
Irish Airline Ryanair Posts Record Profit
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday amid higher fuel prices 
and strong competition, but offered a cautious forecast for 2007. The Dublin-based airline said net income, 
excluding exceptional items, rose 33 percent to 401.4 million euros ($541.7 million) in the 12 months through March 
31, while sales rose 32 percent to nearly 2.24 billion euros ($3.02 billion).
Chinese Stocks Rebound in Late-Day Rally
SHANGHAI, China (AP) Chinese stocks rebounded in volatile trading Tuesday following their sharpest one-day 
drop in three months as strong buying by institutions offset selling by retail investors. The benchmark Shanghai 
Composite Index gained 2.6 percent to 3,767.10 after a rollercoaster session that saw the index plunge as much as 
7.2 percent earlier in the day. It fell 8.3 percent on Monday the benchmark's sharpest decline since an 8.8-percent 
drop Feb. 27 triggered a global market sell-off.

BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) TPG Capital is embarking on its second big telecom venture in two weeks, joining with 
another private equity firm, Silver Lake, in an $8.2 billion bid for Avaya Inc. Avaya said Monday night that it has

its company to a private equity firm to arm itself with new leadership, most notably the former technical guru behind 
the iPod. The deal with Elevation Partners which agreed to invest $325 million for a 25 percent stake in Palm will

Apple Inc.'s June 29 launch of the iPhone.
Murdoch Meets With Bancroft Family
NEW YORK (AP) Rupert Murdoch stepped up his campaign to woo the family that controls Dow Jones & Co. on 
Monday, meeting with key members of the Bancroft family in person to offer assurances that The Wall Street 
Journal would continue its long tradition of excellence under his stewardship. The family had initially rebuffed 
Murdoch's $5 billion offer for the company in early May, but last Thursday they agreed to meet with him. In a 
statement, the family said they were most concerned about protecting the editorial independence and integrity of 
the Wall Street Journal.
Hyundai Grabs Lead in Auto Quality Study
DETROIT (AP) When it comes to car quality, think Korean. Hyundai Motor Co. leads in five categories in the annual 
vehicle quality study released Monday by Strategic Vision Inc., a San Diego-based market research company and

Research in Ann Arbor.

WASHINGTON (AP) There is a multibillion-dollar gap between what public companies book as expenses for their

deductions for stock options being reported to the Internal Revenue Service, is costing the Treasury billions of 
dollars, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Monday. He is proposing that the gap be closed in legislation requiring 
uniform regulations.
Oil Prices Drop As Storm Worries Ease
VIENNA, Austria (AP) Oil prices retreated Tuesday amid easing concerns about a cyclone approaching the Persian 
Gulf and on expectations that a supply report from the United States would show that its gasoline stockpiles rose 
last week. Also sending crude futures lower was news that a Nigerian opposition group had declared a one-month 
cease-fire. That could offer newly inaugurated President Umaru Yar'Adua an opening to solve the crisis that has 
roiled Africa's oil giant, a leading exporter of crude to the United States.
Factory Orders Post Weak Advance
WASHINGTON (AP) Orders to U.S. factories posted a weaker-than-expected gain in April as declines in demand 
for cars, planes and boats offset strength in business investment. The Commerce Department reported Monday 
that factory orders increased by 0.3 percent in April, the weakest showing in three months. It was less than half of 
the 0.8 percent increase that analysts had been expecting.

WASHINGTON (AP) There is a multibillion-dollar gap between what public companies book as expenses for their

uniform regulations.
Oil Prices Drop As Storm Worries Ease
VIENNA, Austria (AP) Oil prices retreated Tuesday amid easing concerns about a cyclone approaching the Persian 
Gulf and on expectations that a supply report from the United States would show that its gasoline stockpiles rose

cease-fire. That could offer newly inaugurated President Umaru Yar'Adua an opening to solve the crisis that has 
roiled Africa's oil giant, a leading exporter of crude to the United States.

U.S. Service Sector Expands
NEW YORK (AP) The nation's service sector expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in May, suggesting it could 
be a driver for broader economic growth as the automotive and housing industries slump, a research group said 
Tuesday. The Institute for Supply Management, based in Tempe, Ariz., said its index of business activity in the non-
manufacturing sector was 59.7 in May. The reading was higher than April's reading of 56 and Wall Street's 
expectation of 56.

Stocks pointed to a lower opening Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke implied the central bank 
has little reason to lower interest rates.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech by satellite to the International Monetary Fund in South Africa Tuesday 
spurred traders to sell, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up to 
new highs. Bernanke said in prepared comments that the economy will recover from its recent feeble performance, 
despite a housing slump that "appears likely to remain a drag on economic growth for somewhat longer than 
previously expected."
Bernanke's forecast of rebounding growth, as well as his comments that inflation is "ebbing" but remains 
"somewhat elevated," made it appear unlikely the Fed will lower rates anytime soon, a disappointment for investors.
After the market opens, investors will be examining the Institute for Supply Management's May index on non-
manufacturing industries, scheduled to be released at 10 a.m. EDT. According to the median estimate of 
economists surveyed by Thomson Financial, the market expects the index to hold steady at 56.0, the same reading 
as in April.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, a diverse group of industries that represents about 80 
percent of U.S. economic activity and includes retailing, banking, construction and agriculture. Investors are hoping 
the report will indicate that the service sector is still expanding. Growth that is too robust could stoke worries about 
the Fed raising interest rates later in the year, however. On Friday, the ISM's manufacturing index came in above 
expectations.
Dow futures expiring in June fell 40, or 0.29 percent, to 13,638.
S&P's 500 index futures fell 5.00, or 0.32 percent, to 1,535.30.
Nasdaq 100 index futures declined 5.75, or 0.30 percent, to 1,931.00.
On Monday, the three major indexes made small gains, with the Dow and the S&P closing at new records.
Stocks Poised to Open Lower
In takeover news, private equity firms Silver Lake and TPG Capital confirmed late Monday they made an $8.2 billion 
bid for Avaya Inc. The telecommunications company agreed to the offer, and its stock rose more than 2 percent in 
pre-market trading.
In other corporate news, Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday amid higher fuel 
prices and strong competition, but made a cautious forecast for 2007. The Irish airline's U.S. shares fell more than 4 
percent in pre-market trading.
The dollar was lower against other major currencies, while gold prices edged higher.
Crude oil futures fell 36 cents to $65.85 a barrel in preopening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, after rising more than $1 a barrel Monday.
In overseas trading, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index increased 2.6 percent after plummeting 8.3 percent 
a day earlier. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.45 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.42 percent, Germany's 
DAX index was down 0.84 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.65 percent.

news is he's still beating the drum pretty hawkishly on inflation," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris 
Private Bank.
The Institute for Supply Management's report on the service sector failed to boost stocks. The ISM's 
nonmanufacturing index came in at 59.7 in May, higher than expected and up from April's reading of 56.0. A 
reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, a diverse group of industries that represents about 80 
percent of U.S. economic activity and includes retailing, banking, construction and agriculture.
Investors want to see growth but worry that if it's too robust, it could not only prevent the Fed from lowering rates 
later in the year, but might even prompt a rate hike a move that could dampen spending.
In late morning trading, the Dow fell 51.20, or 0.37 percent, to 13,625.12.

Stocks Fall on Bernanke Remarks
Bonds slipped after Bernanke's comments, and fell further after the strong service sector data. The yield on the 
benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.97 percent from 4.93 percent late Monday. The 10-year yield has been 
trading at 9-month highs, and appears poised to break through 5 percent, a level not reached since August 2006.
The dollar fell against other major currencies, while gold prices edged lower.
In takeover news, telecommunications company Avaya Inc. said late Monday it agreed to an $8.2 billion offer by 
private equity firms Silver Lake and TPG Capital. Avaya rose 38 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $17.10.
Retail stocks took a hit after home goods seller Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. late Monday warned its fiscal first-quarter 
earnings may fall below Wall Street's expectations. The stock lost $2.22, or 5.5 percent, to $38.25.
The biggest decliner among the 30 Dow component companies was DuPont Co., downgraded by Lehman Brothers 
to an "equal weight" rating from "overweight." The chemicals company fell $1.12, or 2.1 percent, $52.07.

U.S. stocks slumped Tuesday, taking the Dow Jones industrials down more than 100 points, after comments from 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and a strong reading on the service sector suggested the central bank 
has little reason to lower interest rates.
Bernanke's speech by satellite to an international monetary conference in South Africa Tuesday spurred investors 
to sell a day after the Dow and Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up to new highs. Bernanke said the U.S. 
economy will recover from its recent feeble performance, despite a housing slump that "appears likely to remain a 
drag on economic growth for somewhat longer than previously expected."
Bernanke's forecast of rebounding growth, as well as his assessment that inflation is "ebbing" but remains 
"somewhat elevated," made it appear unlikely the Fed will lower rates anytime soon, a disappointment for Wall 
Street.
"The good news is he did say this residential real-estate morass won't leach out into the main economy. The bad 
news is he's still beating the drum pretty hawkishly on inflation," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris 
Private Bank.
While the Fed chairman's comments stalled a months-long rally, many analysts have been predicting Wall Street 
would soon start a correction before likely heading higher later this year. Before Tuesday's decline the Dow and the 
S&P 500 were both up more than 8 percent for the year to date.
The Institute for Supply Management's report on the service sector failed to boost stocks. The ISM's 
nonmanufacturing index came in at 59.7 in May, higher than expected and up from April's reading of 56.0. A 
reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, a diverse group of industries that represents about 80 
percent of U.S. economic activity.
Investors want to see growth but worry that if it is too robust, it could not only prevent the Fed from lowering rates 
later in the year, but might even prompt a rate hike a move that could dampen spending.
US stocks decline after Bernanke comments, service sector data
Wall Street sold off further after a speech by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who said he has been 
pressuring China to make its exchange rate more flexible. If the yuan is given the chance to rise in value, it could 
have a dampening effect on the U.S. dollar.
In midday trading, the Dow fell 102.16, or 0.75 percent, to 13,574.16.
Broader stock indicators also declined. The S&P 500 index lost 11.09, or 0.72 percent, to 1,528.09, and the Nasdaq 
composite index decreased 17.42, or 0.67 percent, to 2,600.87.
Bonds slipped after Bernanke's comments, and fell further after the strong service sector data. The yield on the 
benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.98 percent from 4.93 percent late Monday. The 10-year yield has been

Wall Street skidded lower Tuesday after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and a strong 
reading on the service sector suggested the central bank has little reason to lower interest rates.
Bernanke's speech by satellite to an international monetary conference in South Africa Tuesday spurred investors 
to sell a day after the Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up to new highs. Bernanke 
remarked that the economy will recover from its recent feeble performance, despite a housing slump that he said 
could drag on the economy for longer than anticipated.
His forecast for rebounding growth, as well as his assessment that inflation is "ebbing" but remains "somewhat 
elevated," made it appear unlikely the Fed will lower rates anytime soon, a disappointment for Wall Street. Behind 
the stock market's surge, driven primarily by strong takeover activity, has been a backdrop of stable interest rates 
and the possibility of a rate cut; recently, though, with bond yields creeping up, some investors fear the Fed may 
alter that climate.
"The market is hoping for slow growth and moderate inflation, and now there's concern they might have to bump up 
rates in the second half of the year," said Jim Herrick, director of equity trading at Baird & Co.
While the Fed chairman's comments stalled a months-long rally, many analysts have been predicting Wall Street 
would soon pull back before heading higher later this year. His remarks also came in a week where investors had 
few economic or corporate catalysts to provide direction.
The Institute for Supply Management issued its service sector report Tuesday. The ISM's nonmanufacturing index 
came in at 59.7 in May, higher than expected and up from April's reading of 56.0. A reading above 50 indicates 
expansion in the service sector, a diverse group of industries that represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic 
activity. Investors want to see growth but worry that if it's too robust, it could prompt a rate hike.
The Dow fell 80.86, or 0.59 percent, to 13,595.46, after earlier falling more than 100 points.

Fed Chief Expects Economy to Rebound
WASHINGTON (AP) Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke predicted Tuesday the economy will rebound from 
an anemic performance at the start of the year even if the housing slump continues. Economic growth in the first 
three months of this year nearly stalled, logging just a 0.6 percent pace. It was the worst quarterly showing in more 
than four years.
Stocks Fall After Bernanke Comments
NEW YORK (AP) Stocks slipped in early trading Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke implied 
the central bank has little reason to lower interest rates. Bernanke's speech by satellite to the International 
Monetary Fund in South Africa Tuesday spurred traders to sell a day after the Dow Jones industrial average and 
Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up to new highs. Bernanke said in prepared comments that the economy will 
recover from its recent feeble performance, despite a housing slump that "appears likely to remain a drag on 
economic growth for somewhat longer than previously expected."
Irish Airline Ryanair Posts Record Profit
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday amid higher fuel prices 
and strong competition, but offered a cautious forecast for 2007. The Dublin-based airline said net income, 
excluding exceptional items, rose 33 percent to 401.4 million euros ($541.7 million) in the 12 months through March 
31, while sales rose 32 percent to nearly 2.24 billion euros ($3.02 billion).
Chinese Stocks Rebound in Late-Day Rally
SHANGHAI, China (AP) Chinese stocks rebounded in volatile trading Tuesday following their sharpest one-day 
drop in three months as strong buying by institutions offset selling by retail investors. The benchmark Shanghai 
Composite Index gained 2.6 percent to 3,767.10 after a rollercoaster session that saw the index plunge as much as 
7.2 percent earlier in the day. It fell 8.3 percent on Monday the benchmark's sharpest decline since an 8.8-percent 
drop Feb. 27 triggered a global market sell-off.
Avaya OKs $8.2B Private Equity Buyout
AP Financial NewsBrief at 9:37 a.m. EDT; Tuesday, June 5, 2007
BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) TPG Capital is embarking on its second big telecom venture in two weeks, joining with 
another private equity firm, Silver Lake, in an $8.2 billion bid for Avaya Inc. Avaya said Monday night that it has 
agreed to the firms' offer of $17.50 in cash per share, two weeks after wireless phone company Alltel Corp. 
announced its $24.7 billion buyout by TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s GS Capital Partners.
Palm Sells 25 Pct. Stake to Private Firm
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) Faced with mounting competition in the smart-phone market, Palm Inc. is selling a quarter of 
its company to a private equity firm to arm itself with new leadership, most notably the former technical guru behind 
the iPod. The deal with Elevation Partners which agreed to invest $325 million for a 25 percent stake in Palm will 
infuse new talent in the handheld computer pioneer as it battles stiffening competition that will only get tougher with 
Apple Inc.'s June 29 launch of the iPhone.
Murdoch Meets With Bancroft Family
NEW YORK (AP) Rupert Murdoch stepped up his campaign to woo the family that controls Dow Jones & Co. on 
Monday, meeting with key members of the Bancroft family in person to offer assurances that The Wall Street 
Journal would continue its long tradition of excellence under his stewardship. The family had initially rebuffed 
Murdoch's $5 billion offer for the company in early May, but last Thursday they agreed to meet with him. In a 
statement, the family said they were most concerned about protecting the editorial independence and integrity of 
the Wall Street Journal.
Hyundai Grabs Lead in Auto Quality Study
DETROIT (AP) When it comes to car quality, think Korean. Hyundai Motor Co. leads in five categories in the annual 
vehicle quality study released Monday by Strategic Vision Inc., a San Diego-based market research company and 
consultant to automakers. Hyundai's rise in the rankings is only the latest sign of the improved overall quality and 
declining number of defects in today's cars and trucks, said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive 
Research in Ann Arbor.
Investigators Find Gap in Stock Options
WASHINGTON (AP) There is a multibillion-dollar gap between what public companies book as expenses for their 
executives' stock options and what they report to the IRS under two different sets of rules, according to Senate 
investigators and a key senator who is seeking to change the reporting system. The discrepancy, with far greater 
deductions for stock options being reported to the Internal Revenue Service, is costing the Treasury billions of 
dollars, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Monday. He is proposing that the gap be closed in legislation requiring 
uniform regulations.
Oil Prices Drop As Storm Worries Ease
VIENNA, Austria (AP) Oil prices retreated Tuesday amid easing concerns about a cyclone approaching the Persian 
Gulf and on expectations that a supply report from the United States would show that its gasoline stockpiles rose 
last week. Also sending crude futures lower was news that a Nigerian opposition group had declared a one-month 
cease-fire. That could offer newly inaugurated President Umaru Yar'Adua an opening to solve the crisis that has 
roiled Africa's oil giant, a leading exporter of crude to the United States.

Fed Chief Expects Economy to Rebound
WASHINGTON (AP) Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke predicted Tuesday the economy will rebound from 
an anemic performance at the start of the year even if the housing slump continues. Economic growth in the first 
three months of this year nearly stalled, logging just a 0.6 percent pace. It was the worst quarterly showing in more 
than four years.
Stock Prices Slip in Early Trading
NEW YORK (AP) Stock prices are lower in early trading after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke implied the 
central bank has little reason to lower interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 36.57 at 13,639.85, 
while the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 6.89 to 2,611.40 and the Standard & Poor's 500 is off 3.97 at 1,535,21.
Irish Airline Ryanair Posts Record Profit
DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday amid higher fuel prices 
and strong competition, but offered a cautious forecast for 2007. The Dublin-based airline said net income, 
excluding exceptional items, rose 33 percent to 401.4 million euros ($541.7 million) in the 12 months through March 
31, while sales rose 32 percent to nearly 2.24 billion euros ($3.02 billion).
Chinese Stocks Rebound in Late-Day Rally
SHANGHAI, China (AP) Chinese stocks rebounded in volatile trading Tuesday following their sharpest one-day 
drop in three months as strong buying by institutions offset selling by retail investors. The benchmark Shanghai 
Composite Index gained 2.6 percent to 3,767.10 after a rollercoaster session that saw the index plunge as much as 
7.2 percent earlier in the day. It fell 8.3 percent on Monday the benchmark's sharpest decline since an 8.8-percent 
drop Feb. 27 triggered a global market sell-off.
Avaya OKs $8.2B Private Equity Buyout

Palm Sells 25 Pct. Stake to Private Firm
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) Faced with mounting competition in the smart-phone market, Palm Inc. is selling a quarter of 
its company to a private equity firm to arm itself with new leadership, most notably the former technical guru behind 
the iPod. The deal with Elevation Partners which agreed to invest $325 million for a 25 percent stake in Palm will 
infuse new talent in the handheld computer pioneer as it battles stiffening competition that will only get tougher with 
Apple Inc.'s June 29 launch of the iPhone.
Murdoch Meets With Bancroft Family
NEW YORK (AP) Rupert Murdoch stepped up his campaign to woo the family that controls Dow Jones & Co. on 
Monday, meeting with key members of the Bancroft family in person to offer assurances that The Wall Street 
Journal would continue its long tradition of excellence under his stewardship. The family had initially rebuffed 
Murdoch's $5 billion offer for the company in early May, but last Thursday they agreed to meet with him. In a 
statement, the family said they were most concerned about protecting the editorial independence and integrity of 
the Wall Street Journal.
Hyundai Grabs Lead in Auto Quality Study
DETROIT (AP) When it comes to car quality, think Korean. Hyundai Motor Co. leads in five categories in the annual 
vehicle quality study released Monday by Strategic Vision Inc., a San Diego-based market research company and 
consultant to automakers. Hyundai's rise in the rankings is only the latest sign of the improved overall quality and 
declining number of defects in today's cars and trucks, said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive 
Research in Ann Arbor.
Investigators Find Gap in Stock Options
WASHINGTON (AP) There is a multibillion-dollar gap between what public companies book as expenses for their 
executives' stock options and what they report to the IRS under two different sets of rules, according to Senate 
investigators and a key senator who is seeking to change the reporting system. The discrepancy, with far greater 
deductions for stock options being reported to the Internal Revenue Service, is costing the Treasury billions of 
dollars, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Monday. He is proposing that the gap be closed in legislation requiring 
uniform regulations.
Oil Prices Drop As Storm Worries Ease
VIENNA, Austria (AP) Oil prices retreated Tuesday amid easing concerns about a cyclone approaching the Persian 
Gulf and on expectations that a supply report from the United States would show that its gasoline stockpiles rose 
last week. Also sending crude futures lower was news that a Nigerian opposition group had declared a one-month 
cease-fire. That could offer newly inaugurated President Umaru Yar'Adua an opening to solve the crisis that has 
roiled Africa's oil giant, a leading exporter of crude to the United States.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said Tuesday that annual profit rose 42 percent despite 
higher fuel prices and strong competition but offered a cautious forecast for this year.
The Dublin-based company said net income rose to €435.6 million (US$586.4 million) in the 12 months through 
March 31 from €306.7 million a year earlier. Excluding exceptional items, earnings rose 33 percent to €401.4 million 
(US$541.7 million).
Sales rose 32 percent to nearly €2.24 billion (US$3.02 billion).
But Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he didn't expect such strong gains in 2007, with overall profit growth 
slowing to 5 percent as average ticket prices fall by 5 percent.
"Forward bookings and yields continue to be soft and Ryanair continues to respond with aggressive price 
promotions. ... Ryanair will lead and win every fare war in Europe, because Ryanair has the lowest costs and the 
lowest fares," O'Leary said in a statement.
He said Ryanair expected most of its fiscal 2007 profits to be generated from April to September, while the airline 
could suffer "small losses" in the period from October to March 2008.
Ryanair shares fell 6.8 percent to €5.05 (US$6.82) on the Irish Stock Exchange, reflecting O'Leary's downbeat 
assessment, the rising percentage of empty seats on Ryanair's growing network and a lower overall market.
The airline said its average ticket price was 7 percent higher than in 2005, while the value of its related sales for 
travel insurance, car and hotel booking, baggage-checking charges, food and beverages rose 40 percent to €362.1 
million (US$488.7 million).
But fuel costs rose 50 percent to €693.3 million (US$935.7 million), representing 39 percent of total operating 
expenses, up from 35 percent in fiscal 2005.
Budget airline Ryanair says 2006 profit rose 42 percent, offers cautious forecast for 2007
And airport and handling charges always a sore point for Ryanair, which seeks out far-flung airports willing to 
charge less increased 27 percent to €273.6 million (US$369.3 million).
Ryanair said it sold 82 percent of its seats in fiscal 2006, down one percentage point.
The airline also said Tuesday that it carried nearly 4.15 million passengers last month, 17 percent more than in May 
2006, because of its expansion of services, particularly into Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean and Morocco. 
However, the percentage of sold seats declined to 80 percent from 82 percent.
Ryanair's cash reserves rose 8.7 percent over the year to €2.2 billion (US$2.97 billion) even though, from October 
to December, it spent €344.9 million (US$465.5 million) acquiring a 25.2 percent stake in its Dublin-based rival, Aer 
Lingus PLC.
O'Leary and deputy chief executive Frank Millar both said they expect European Union competition authorities to 
reject Ryanair's takeover plans, which have been on hold since December. The EU verdict is expected by July 4.
The Irish government which retained a 25 percent Aer Lingus stake in September when it floated the previously 
state-controlled airline opposes the Ryanair approach, as do employee-controlled trusts holding about 20 percent of 
shares.
"It's very much a long shot, very much unlikely, that we will get EU competition approval," Millar told Irish 
broadcaster RTE.
But O'Leary vowed to challenge any EU rejection.
Given what he called the EU's "significant inaccuracies and omissions" in its initial assessments of a merged 
Ryanair-Aer Lingus operation, he said legal action "has a high prospect of success."

U.S. Service Sector Expands
NEW YORK (AP) The nation's service sector expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in May, suggesting it could 
be a driver for broader economic growth as the automotive and housing industries slump, a research group said 
Tuesday. The Institute for Supply Management, based in Tempe, Ariz., said its index of business activity in the non-
manufacturing sector was 59.7 in May. The reading was higher than April's reading of 56 and Wall Street's 
expectation of 56.
Stocks Fall After Bernanke Comments
NEW YORK (AP) Stocks dipped Tuesday after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and a 
strong reading on the U.S. service sector suggested the central bank has little reason to lower interest rates. 
Bernanke's speech by satellite to the International Monetary Fund in South Africa Tuesday spurred traders to sell a 
day after the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up to new highs. Bernanke said 
in prepared comments that the economy will recover from its recent feeble performance, despite a housing slump 
that "appears likely to remain a drag on economic growth for somewhat longer than previously expected."

Stocks pointed toward a lower opening Tuesday as Wall Street cautiously awaited data on the nation's service 
sector.
Investors will be examining the Institute for Supply Management's May index on non-manufacturing industries, 
scheduled to be released at 10 a.m. EDT. According to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Thomson 
Financial, the market expects the index to hold steady at 56.0, the same reading as in April.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, a diverse group of industries that represents about 80 
percent of U.S. economic activity and includes retailing, banking, construction and agriculture. Investors are hoping 
the report will indicate that the service sector is still expanding. Growth that is too robust could stoke worries about 
the Federal Reserve raising interest rates later in the year, however. On Friday, the ISM's manufacturing index 
came in above expectations.
Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech by satellite to the International Monetary Fund in South Africa 
Tuesday gave investors little incentive to buy. He said in prepared comments that the economy will recover from its 
recent feeble performance, despite a housing slump that "appears likely to remain a drag on economic growth for 
somewhat longer than previously expected."
Bernanke's forecast of rebounding growth, as well as a reiteration that inflation remains "somewhat elevated," made 
it appear unlikely the Fed will lower rates anytime soon.
Dow Jones industrial futures expiring in June fell 33, or 0.24 percent, to 13,645.
Standard & Poor's 500 index futures fell 3.10, or 0.20 percent, to 1,537.20.
Nasdaq 100 index futures declined 5.00, or 0.26 percent, to 1,931.75.
On Monday, the three major indexes made small gains, with the Dow and the S&P closing at new records.
Stocks point lower opening ahead of service sector data
In takeover news, private equity firms Silver Lake and TPG Capital confirmed late Monday they made an $8.2 billion 
bid for Avaya Inc. The telecommunications company agreed to the offer, and its stock rose 2.6 percent in pre-
market trading.
In other corporate news, Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday amid higher fuel 
prices and strong competition, but made a cautious forecast for 2007. The Irish airline's U.S. shares fell nearly 4 
percent in pre-market trading.
The dollar was lower against other major currencies, while gold prices edged higher.
Crude oil futures fell 40 cents to $65.81 a barrel in preopening electronic trading on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, after rising more than $1 a barrel Monday.
In overseas trading, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index increased 2.6 percent after plummeting 8.3 percent 
a day earlier. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.45 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.12 percent, Germany's 
DAX index was down 0.36 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.52 percent.

Gap Seen in Companies Reporting Options
WASHINGTON (AP) There is a multibillion-dollar gap between what public companies book as expenses for their 
executives' stock options and what they report to the IRS under two different sets of rules, according to Senate 
investigators and a key senator who is seeking to change the reporting system. The discrepancy, with far greater 
deductions for stock options being reported to the Internal Revenue Service, is costing the Treasury billions of 
dollars, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Monday. He is proposing that the gap be closed in legislation requiring 
uniform regulations.

Wall Street skidded lower Tuesday after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and a strong 
reading on the U.S. service sector suggested the central bank has little reason to lower interest rates.
Bernanke's speech by satellite to an international monetary conference in South Africa Tuesday spurred investors 
to sell a day after the Dow and Standard & Poor's 500 index edged up to new highs. Bernanke remarked that the 
U.S. economy will recover from its recent feeble performance, despite a housing slump that he said could drag on 
the economy for longer than anticipated.
Bernanke's forecast of rebounding growth, as well as his assessment that inflation is "ebbing" but remains 
"somewhat elevated," made it appear unlikely the Federal Reserve will lower rates anytime soon, a disappointment 
for Wall Street. Behind the stock market's surge, driven primarily by strong takeover activity, has been a backdrop 
of stable interest rates and the possibility of a rate cut; recently, though, with bond yields creeping up, some 
investors fear the Fed may alter that climate.
"The market is hoping for slow growth and moderate inflation, and now there's concern they might have to bump up 
rates in the second half of the year," said Jim Herrick, director of equity trading at Baird & Co.
While the Fed chairman's comments stalled a months-long rally, many analysts have been predicting Wall Street 
would soon pull back before heading higher later this year. Before Tuesday's decline, the Dow and the S&P 500 
had risen more than 8 percent since the beginning of the year.
A robust report on the service sector from the Institute for Supply Management failed to boost stocks. The ISM's 
nonmanufacturing index came in at 59.7 in May, higher than expected and up from April's reading of 56.0. A 
reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, a diverse group of industries that represents about 80 
percent of U.S. economic activity. Investors want to see growth but worry that if it's too robust, it could prompt a rate 
hike.
The Dow fell 80.86, or 0.59 percent, to 13,595.46, after earlier falling more than 100 points.

Broader indexes also retreated. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.23, or 0.53 percent, to 1,530.95, while the 
Nasdaq composite index shed 7.06, or 0.27 percent, to 2,611.23.
Bonds slipped after Bernanke's comments and the strong service sector data.
"The good news is he did say this residential real-estate morass won't leach out into the main economy. The bad 
news is he's still beating the drum pretty hawkishly on inflation," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris 
Private Bank.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.98 percent from 4.93 percent late Monday. The 10-
year yield is trading at 9-month highs, and appears poised to break through 5 percent, a level not reached since 
August 2006.
Stocks sold off further after a midday speech by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who said he has been 
pressuring China to make its exchange rate more flexible. If the yuan is given the chance to rise in value, it could 
have a dampening effect on the U.S. dollar.
The dollar fell against other major currencies, while gold prices edged lower.
In takeover news, telecommunications company Avaya Inc. said late Monday it agreed to an $8.2 billion (euro6.06 
billion) offer by private equity firms Silver Lake and TPG Capital. Avaya rose 31 cents to $17.03.
Retail stocks took a hit after home goods seller Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. late Monday warned its fiscal first-quarter 
earnings may fall below analyst estimates. The stock lost $2.20, or 5.4 percent, to $38.27.
The biggest decliner among the 30 Dow component companies was DuPont Co., downgraded by Lehman Brothers 
to an "equal weight" rating from "overweight." The chemicals company fell 95 cents to $52.24.
In other corporate news, Ryanair Holdings PLC reported a record full-year 2006 profit despite higher fuel prices and 
tough competition, but made a cautious forecast for 2007. The Irish airline's U.S. shares fell $1.69, or 4.2 percent, 
to $38.66.
Google Inc. rose $11.77, or 2.3 percent, to an all-time high of $518.84. The search leader signed an agreement with 
Salesforce.com Inc. to cooperate on online advertising.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated 
volume was 2.86 billion shares, compared with 2.69 billion Monday.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 6.84, or 0.80 percent, at 848.25.
Crude oil futures for July delivery fell 60 cents to $65.61 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Irish budget airline Ryanair posts record 2006 profit, offers cautious forecast for 2007
Irish budget airline Ryanair posts record 2006 profit, offers cautious forecast

Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday amid higher fuel prices and strong competition, 
but offered a cautious forecast for 2007.
The Dublin-based airline said net income, excluding exceptional items, rose 33 percent to 401.4 million euros 
($541.7 million) in the 12 months through March 31, while sales rose 32 percent to nearly 2.24 billion euros ($3.02 
billion).
But chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expected to post less stellar growth in 2007, with overall profit growth 
slowing to 5 percent, mirroring the percentage drop for an average ticket.
Ryanair shares fell 7.01 percent to 5.04 euros ($6.78) on the Irish Stock Exchange Tuesday, reflecting O'Leary's 
downbeat assessment and the rising percentage of empty seats on Ryanair's growing network.
"Forward bookings and yields continue to be soft and Ryanair continues to respond with aggressive price 
promotions. ... Ryanair will lead and win every fare war in Europe, because Ryanair has the lowest costs and the 
lowest fares," O'Leary said in a statement.
O'Leary said Ryanair expected most of its fiscal 2007 profits to be generated from April to September, while the 
airline could suffer "small losses" in the October 2007-March 2008 period.
Ryanair said its average ticket price rose 7 percent in the last year, while sales of "ancillary" products insurance, car 
and hotel booking, baggage-checking charges, food and beverages rose 40 percent to 362.1 million euros ($488.7 
million).
Offsetting some of those gains, fuel costs rose 50 percent to 693.3 million euros ($935.7 million), representing 39 
percent of total operating expenses, up from 35 percent in fiscal 2005.
Irish budget airline Ryanair posts record 2006 profit, offers cautious forecast for 2007
Airport and handling charges always a sore point for Ryanair, which seeks out far-flung airports willing to charge 
less increased by 27 percent to 273.6 million euros ($369.3 million).
Ryanair said it sold 82 percent of its seats in fiscal 2006, down one point, reflecting its rapidly expanding route 
network.
Ryanair's strong financial position versus other European budget carriers is underscored by its growing cash 
reserves. These rose 8.7 percent over the year to 2.2 billion euros ($2.97 billion), even though Ryanair spent 344.9 
million euros ($465.5 million) to acquire a 25.2 percent stake in its Dublin-based rival, Aer Lingus.
O'Leary and deputy chief executive, Frank Millar, both said they expect European Union competition authorities to 
reject Ryanair's takeover bid. The EU verdict is expected by July 4.
The Irish government which retained a 25 percent Aer Lingus stake in September when it floated the previously 
state-controlled airline on the Irish and British stock exchanges opposes Ryanair, as do employee-controlled trusts 
accounting for about 20 percent of shareholders.
"It's very much a long shot, very much unlikely, that we will get EU competition approval," Millar told Irish 
broadcaster RTE.
But O'Leary vowed to challenge any EU rejection in European courts.
He said, given what he called the EU's "significant inaccuracies and omissions" in its initial assessments of a 
merged Ryanair-Aer Lingus operation, that legal action "has a high prospect of success."
Ryanair, which was founded in 1985, employs 4,500 people and operates 487 routes from 20 European bases 
operating an all-Boeing network. It carried 42.5 million passengers last year and expects to carry more than 52 
million this year.

Irish budget airline Ryanair posts record 2006 profit, offers cautious forecast for 2007
Irish budget airline Ryanair posts record 2006 profit, offers cautious forecast

Ryanair Holdings PLC posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday despite higher fuel prices and strong 
competition, but offered a cautious forecast for 2007.
The Dublin-based airline said net income, excluding exceptional items, rose 33 percent to €401.4 million (US$541.7 
million) in the 12 months through March 31, while sales rose 32 percent to nearly €2.24 billion (US$3.02 billion).
But chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expected to post less stellar growth in 2007, with overall profit growth 
slowing to 5 percent as average ticket prices fall by 5 percent.
"Forward bookings and yields continue to be soft and Ryanair continues to respond with aggressive price 
promotions. ... Ryanair will lead and win every fare war in Europe, because Ryanair has the lowest costs and the 
lowest fares," O'Leary said in a statement.
O'Leary said Ryanair expected most of its fiscal 2007 profits to be generated from April to September, while the 
airline could suffer "small losses" in the October 2007-March 2008 period.
Ryanair said its average ticket price rose 7 percent in the last year, while sales of "ancillary" products insurance, car 
and hotel booking, baggage-checking charges, food and beverages rose 40 percent to €362.1 million (US$488.7 
million).
Offsetting some of those gains, fuel costs rose 50 percent to €693.3 million (US$935.7 million), representing 39 
percent of total operating expenses, up from 35 percent in fiscal 2005.
Airport and handling charges always a sore point for Ryanair, which seeks out far-flung airports willing to charge 
less increased by 27 percent to €273.6 million (US$369.3 million).
Ryanair said it sold 82 percent of its seats in fiscal 2006, down one point, reflecting its rapidly expanding route 
network.

Ryanair's strong financial position versus other European budget carriers is underscored by its growing cash 
reserves. These rose 8.7 percent over the year to €2.2 billion (US$2.97 billion) even though, from October to 
December, Ryanair spent €344.9 million (US$465.5 million) acquiring a 25.2 percent stake in its Dublin-based rival, 
Aer Lingus.
O'Leary and deputy chief executive, Frank Millar, both said they expect European Union competition authorities to 
reject Ryanair's takeover bid, which has been on hold since December. The EU verdict is expected by July 4.
The Irish government which retained a 25 percent Aer Lingus stake in September when it floated the previously 
state-controled airline on the Irish and British stock exchanges opposes the Ryanair approach, as do employee-
controlled trusts accounting for about 20 percent more shareholders.
"It's very much a long shot, very much unlikely, that we will get EU competition approval," Millar told Irish 
broadcaster RTE.
But O'Leary vowed to challenge any EU rejection in European courts.
He said, given what he called the EU's "significant inaccuracies and omissions" in its initial assessments of a 
merged Ryanair-Aer Lingus operation, that legal action "has a high prospect of success."
Ryanair, which was founded in 1985, employs 4,500 people and operates 487 routes from 20 European bases 
operating an all-Boeing network. It carried 42.5 million passengers last year and expects to carry more than 52 
million this year.

Body
US stock prices are lower in early trading after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke implied the central bank 
has little reason to lower interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average is down 36.57 at 13,639.85, while the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 6.89 to 
2,611.40 and the Standard and Poor's 500 is off 3.97 at 1,535,21.
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech by satellite to the International Monetary Fund in South Africa Tuesday 
spurred traders to sell, a day after the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard and Poor's 500 index edged up 
to new highs. Bernanke said in prepared comments that the economy will recover from its recent feeble 
performance, despite a housing slump that 'appears likely to remain a drag on economic growth for somewhat 
longer than previously expected.'
 Bernanke's forecast of rebounding growth, as well as his comments that inflation is 'ebbing' but remains 'somewhat 
elevated,' made it appear unlikely the Fed will lower rates anytime soon, a disappointment for investors. After the 
market opens, investors will be examining the Institute for Supply Management's May index on non-manufacturing 
industries, scheduled to be released at 10 a.m. EDT. According to the median estimate of economists surveyed by 
Thomson Financial, the market expects the index to hold steady at 56.0, the same reading as in April. A reading 
above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector, a diverse group of industries that represents about 80 percent 
of U.S. economic activity and includes retailing, banking, construction and agriculture. Investors are hoping the 
report will indicate that the service sector is still expanding. Growth that is too robust could stoke worries about the 
Fed raising interest rates later in the year, however. On Friday, the ISM's manufacturing index came in above 
expectations. On Monday, the three major indexes made small gains, with the Dow and the S and P closing at new 
records. In takeover news, private equity firms Silver Lake and TPG Capital confirmed late Monday they made an 
dollar 8.2 billion bid for Avaya Inc. The telecommunications company agreed to the offer, and its stock rose more 
than 2 percent in pre-market trading. In other corporate news, Ryanair posted a record full-year 2006 profit Tuesday

gold prices edged higher. Crude oil futures fell 36 cents to USD65.85 a barrel in preopening electronic trading on

Around E2.5 billion was wiped off the value of Irish shares today as investors braced themselves for tomorrow's 
European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on interest rates.
The overall ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 2.5pc, or 247.45 points, lower at 9,715.99.
The ECB is all but certain to raise rates to 4pc at its governing council meeting. Markets will, however, be more 
interested in any hints of further rate hikes to follow for the rest of the year.
 A rate hike this week is firmly expected after ECB president, Jean Claude Trichet, said after the May 10 meeting in 
Dublin that the Central Bank had adopted a stance of 'strong vigilance' on inflation risks - wording that the central 
bank has repeatedly used to signal an upcoming rate hike. Uncertainty over interest rates weighed heavy on 
investor sentiment in Dublin today, with financial shares the hardest hit. Investors were also shaken by a negative 
opening on Wall Street after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and a strong reading on the 
U.S. service sector suggested the central bank has little reason to lower interest rates. Bernanke said the U.S. 
economy will recover from its recent feeble performance, despite a housing slump that 'appears likely to remain a 
drag on economic growth for somewhat longer than previously expected.' Bernanke's forecast of rebounding 
growth, as well as his assessment that inflation is 'ebbing' but remains 'somewhat elevated,' made it appear unlikely 
the Fed will lower rates anytime soon, a disappointment for Wall Street. Shares in Irish Life and Permanent 
plummeted by over 3pc, or 72c, to 19.82, while Anglo Irish Bank fell 12c to 17.39 and Bank of Ireland slipped 36c to 
15.60.AIB, Ireland's largest financial institution, closed 75c lower at 21.79 ahead of the release of a pre-close 
trading update tomorrow. The bank indicated at its AGM last month that it was expecting 'low double digit growth in 
earnings per share'. Shares in Ryanair continued their recent struggle after the airline posted record profits but 
predicted a bumpy ride over the months to come. The airline said profits are likely to grow by around 5pc this year - 
the slowest rate in four years - as the company slashes ticket prices to attract passengers. Chief Executive, Michael 
O'Leary said it could even incur a loss in the second half of the year. The cautious outlook also had a detrimental

effect on Aer Lingus, with shares in the former state carrier falling 5c to 2.80. Elsewhere on the market, drinks group 
C and C fell 59c to 11.90, while ferries operator Irish Continental Group slipped 92c to 20.08 and bookmaker Paddy 
Power fell 72c to 21.51. Meanwhile, cement maker Readymix lost 5pc, or 14c, to close at 2.66 after it announced 
that it is in talks to sell off selective parts of its concrete products business. Positive equities were few and far 
between, however, Trinity Biotech managed to climb 3pc, or 7c, to 2.10, while Smurfit Kappa added on 25c to 19.50 
and tropical fruits distributor Fyffes tacked on 1c to 0.93.

Body
Ryanair has re-iterated that it will take legal action if the European Commission rules that it must sell its 25pc stake 
in Aer Lingus.
The European Union competition authorities are widely expected to reject Ryanair's takeover bid, which has been 
on hold since December. The EU verdict is expected by July 4.
Speculation has grown over recent days that the Commission could even rule that Ryanair must sell its stake.
 The Irish government - which retained a 25pc Aer Lingus stake in September when it floated the previously state-
controlled airline on the Irish and British stock exchanges - opposes the Ryanair approach, as do employee-
controlled trusts accounting for about 20pc more shareholders. "It's very much a long shot, very much unlikely, that 
we will get EU competition approval," Ryanair said today. However, the airline has again vowed to challenge any 
EU rejection in European courts. That legal action "has a high prospect of success," the airline claims. "Any failure 
by the European Commission to approve this merger will be an entirely political decision to put the narrow political 
interests of the Irish Government before those of European competition and European consumers," Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said in London today. The comments came as the airline today announced record full 
year profits for 2006, but warned that only modest profit growth is expected in the current year. Full year net profit 
soared 33pc to E401m, around E11m ahead of previous guidance, on revenue up 32pc to E2.24bn. Passenger 
traffic grew by 22pc to 42.5m while yields, reflecting average fares, rose 7pc. Shares in the airline were down 6pc or 
36c to 5.05 in Dublin today.

The Dublin market slumped by over 1.5pc this morning on the back of sharp falls in no frills airline Ryanair.
Just before midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 154.02 points to 9,809.42.
Ryanair was the biggest loser, falling 6pc, or 36c, to 5.05 after it today posted record profits for 2006, but warned 
that profit growth is likely to fall in the current year due to a softening in the market.
 The airline said it expects profits to grow by just 5pc in 2007, while average yields (the amount of money it pockets 
from each passenger) are likely to be softer. It said this morning that profit after tax but before one-off items rose to 
E401.4m in the 12 months to the end of March 2007 compared to E301.5m a year earlier and the E393.5m average 
forecast by analysts. Shares in Aer Lingus also continued their recent slump, slipping 5c to 2.80 amid concerns 
about a slowdown in the airline sector. Elsewhere on the market, financial shares made a sluggish start to the 
session, with Anglo Irish Bank falling 27c to 17.24, AIB down 40c to 22.14 and Irish Life and Permanent down 3pc, 
or 63c, to 19.91. Bank of Ireland fell 15c to 16.80. In the construction sector, CRH was down 30c to 37.05, while 
Grafton fell 11c to 11.73 and Kingspan slipped 25c to trade at 22.00. McInerney bucked the negative trend, adding 
on 3c to 2.72. Other notable movers this morning included C and C, down 3pc, or 31c, to 12.10, Irish Continental 
Group, down 85c to 20.15, and Elan, down 21c to 14.44. Origin Enterprises, the IAWS subsidiary which joined the 
Irish Stock Exchange this morning, was unchanged at 3.80.

No-frills airline Ryanair turned in record profits of 401 million for the year to 31 May, one-third more than last year 
and 11 million ahead of previous guidance.
But chief executive Michael O'Leary warns that soft market conditions in the current year will see discounted fares, 
reduced yields and profit growth limited to 5%.
'This remains an extremely volatile and cyclical business, but over time the price leaders such as Southwest in the 
US and Ryanair in Europe have repeatedly demonstrated that during periods of adverse trading conditions, the 
lowest fare and lowest cost carrier makes the greatest gains,' he said.
As the price gap widened between Ryanair and its competitors, O'Leary says the figures are a tribute to Ryanair's 
low fare model. In fact fares increased by 7% last year largely driven, he says, by competitor fare increases and fuel 
surcharges.
Another factor was the checked baggage fees designed to encourage passengers to travel with carry-on luggage 
only.
'Ancillary revenue grew 40% thanks to a better passenger spend, increased penetration and the growth of excess 
baggage revenues,' he said in a statement accompanying the figures.
Forward bookings and yields are soft and Ryanair is investing in promotions offering £20 off all return fares with a 
money back guarantee for customers getting cheaper offers.
Although he is confident that traffic will grow 22% to over 52 million passengers this year, if trading continues to be 
soft, yields will fall by up to 5% and profit growth limited to 5%.
Ryanair (RYA) shares fell 4.57% to 5.12 in early trading, down 0.245.
From next month the company is to use up to 300 million of its 2.2 billion cash in hand in a share buy-back 
programme which at the current share price of 5.2 equates to around 3.63% of the issued share capital, he adds.
Despite the doubling of UK airport departure taxes, Europe's largest low-cost airline increased traffic by 22% to 42.5 
million against 34.8 million and revenue by 32% to 2.24 billion from 1.69 billion. Unit costs increased 9% mainly due 
to a 50% increase in fuel costs to 693 billion, but the margin after tax was still 18%.
Ryanair profits fly to record, but growth this year may be cut to 5%
The fall in the oil price and the weakness of the US dollar has allowed Ryanair to hedge 90% of its fuel bill through 
to 2008 for 10% less a barrel than it paid last year. This will help offset increased airport charges, particularly at 
Dublin and Stansted, which doubled on 1 April.
During the year the Irish airline bought 30 new aircraft raising its fleet to 133, started 153 new routes, opened new 
bases at Marseille, Madrid and Bremen and acquired a 25.2% stake in Aer Lingus.
A further 30 aircraft will be delivered this year, five old ones have been sold and three new bases will be opened, 
two of them at Bristol and Dusseldorf-Niederrhein.
O'Leary says the six-month long European Commission review of Ryanair's proposed offer for Aer Lingus is difficult 
to understand as it involves two Irish airlines with bases in Dublin which together account for less than 5% of 
European Union traffic.
The uncertain outlook makes broker Collins Stewart advise either avoiding or holding the shares although it makes 
the point that the share buy-back should provide them with a softer landing.
'It wouldn't be the first time Michael O'Leary has managed market expectations downwards only to go on to surpass 
them and we think he has good reason to do this now', said analyst Andrew Fitchie.
Clearly Ryanair is still pursuing Aer Lingus and painting a poorer picture of the low cost air travel market will lead to 
a lower price and less ammunition for those opposed to the takeover, he adds.

Full year profits at Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, surged 33pc but it warned it expected growth to fall to about 5pc in 
the current year due to weaker ticket prices.
Profit after tax but before one-off items rose to E401.4m in the 12 months to the end of March compared to E301.5 
million a year earlier and the E393.5 million average expected by a host of market analysts.
Ryanair, which had cash reserves of E2.2bn at the end of March, also said it planned to buy back and cancel 
E300m worth of its own shares from about June 7.
 Net profit climbed to E435.6m in the 12 months to the end of March, the airline said. Ryanair has benefited from its 
decision to start charging customers for every bag that they check in, and for services such as priority boarding. 
However, Ryanair warned that profit growth would slow in the current year. "We expect profit growth over the 
coming year to be more modest and to rise by approximately 5pc," Ryanair said. "We believe that the company and 
our shareholders should remain cautious and conservative," it said. The firm added that it is winning the price war 
among low-cost airlines.

Ryanair hit out at the negative publicity surrounding aviation's contribution to carbon dioxide emissions as the Irish 
low-cost carrier firmed options to buy a further 27 Boeing 737-800s.The deal will take Ryanair's overall fleet to 262 
aircraft by 2012 and is a further step towards its goal of transporting 87 million passengers a year.Ryanair deputy

global carbon dioxide emissions could be contributing to the softening in demand the airline has experienced in

interest rates, taxes and airport charges are the main drivers behind the softening in demand, but concedes: "I am 
concerned about the continued media hysteria. There's a little bit of an agenda out there. It is impacting at the 
edges."

BriefingNASA gives 8 June Shuttle flight go-aheadLAUNCH NASA's 30-31 May Flight Readiness Review (FRR) 
last week approved the 19:38 local time launch on 8 June of Space Shuttle Atlantis for its STS-117 mission to the 
International Space Station. During the 11-day mission three spacewalks will see a 17,000kg (37,500lb) segment of 
the station's girder-like truss structure installed and the deployment of a set of solar arrays. The arrays will increase 
the ISS's power capability for the new European and Japanese space agencies' science modules to be delivered at 
year-end and early in 2008. Atlantis will transport new ISS crew member Clayton Anderson to the station. 
He will replace current NASA ISS crew member Sunita Williams, who will return on Atlantis. The first FRR for STS-
117 was held on 27-28 February. A hail storm on 26 February damaged Atlantis's external fuel tank and delayed 
the planned mid-March launch.Flight hiresAPPOINTMENTS Flight has made a series of appointments as part of an 
expansion of its Washington DC office. Stephen Trimble has been promoted to Americas managing editor and 
takes overall responsibility for Flight's coverage of North and South America. Mark Rockwell has joined the team as 
senior editor, while Megan Kuhn takes on the role of reporter from 25 June.Ryanair incidentCLARIFICATION Last 
week we reported information circulated by the US National Transportation Safety Board regarding an incident 
involving a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 on 13 May (Flight International 29 May-4 June). We are happy to clarify that the 
aircraft did not suffer a loss of its electronic flight instrument displays. Ryanair says one of the three separate sets of 
air speed and altitude indicators in the cockpit indicated an error and as a precaution the crew returned to London 
Stansted. Contrary to our report, the UK Air Accidents Investigation Board does not intend to investigate the 
incident, but Ryanair has reported the matter to the Irish Aviation Authority as is normal in such cases.

Highlight: The Dublin market closed in a holiday mood following a week of mixed fortunes.
Body
The Dublin market closed in a holiday mood following a week of mixed fortunes for investors with some of the 
index's top companies reporting mostly upbeat performances.
At the closing bell, the ISEQ index of top Irish shares was up 108.58 points to 9,963.44.
There was precious little on the economic front to cheer the market on Friday with the prospect of major job cuts at 
Dell, weakening manufacturing sector growth, rising unemployment and prediction of a slowdown in job creation 
this year and next.
 Nevertheless, while trading volumes were down about a quarter as the market geared up for the Bank Holiday 
weekend, investors snapped up key shares across a range of sectors. Among the big gainers was AIB with shares 
up 4c to E22.46 as investors sought out bargains following the slight decline in the stock over the last two weeks or 
so. And investors were largely unperturbed by the latest Private Sector Credit figures from the Central Bank. These 
show that Irish private sector credit growth continued to slow down in April. Although the rate of growth at 22.2pc on 
a yearly basis remains exceptionally high compared to the rest of the euro-area, which enjoys an average growth 
rate of around 10pc, the latest reading is the lowest in three years. Unsurprisingly, given the slowdown in the 
property sector, mortgage credit growth also slowed in April, with the annual rate falling from 22pc in March to 21pc 
in April. Bank of Ireland shares faded slightly after Thursday's strong full-year profit and loan book figures. 
Goodbody Stockbrokers' analyst, Eamonn Hughes, said the broker is leaving its headline pre-tax profit and 
earnings per share figures for full-year 2008 unchanged at E1,928m and 161.8 cent, respectively. This implies 
earnings per share growth of 12pc in the current period, which fits within the company guidance of 'low double digit 
earnings growth,' he said. Shares edged down 3c to E15.98. Shares in drinks group, C and C topped the 
leaderboard with a gain of 28c to E12.65 amid prospects that the group's increased cider production will see record 
sales of its blockbuster Magners brand in the UK and Bulmers in Ireland. Shares in Greencore slipped after 
Thursday's strong showing on the back of surprisingly good half-year figures for the food group. The slippage came 
ISEQ closes week in top form
despite an upgrade for the stock's potential full-year 2007 earnings per share by a significant 10pc from 
Goodbodys. Shares dipped 2c to E4.85. Ryanair was a major winner with shares up 8c to E5.40 after it announced 
eight new routes from Shannon starting in November. Investors are largely supportive of Mr O'Leary's strategy of 
weathering through the current downturn in no-frills airline seat growth regardless and the continuation of the 
strategy of growth. Among the construction shares, CRH jumped E1.36 to E37.46 following news from the US - a 
market where it makes just over half of its entire earnings - showed a continuation of trends seen in 2005 with the 
downturn in the domestic house building sector balanced off by growth in non-residential and infrastructure. Still in 
the construction sector, Grafton shares dropped 4c to E11.75. Goodbody analyst, Robert Eason, noted that data 
released yesterday by the Bank of England showed that the pace of mortgage approvals in the UK was flat year on 
year in April at 107,000, down from 112,000 in March and behind consensus of 110,000 indicating a levelling out in 
the property market where Grafton has a significant exposure.

Shares on the Dublin market were marginally up this morning buoyed by the construction sector. 
At 11.30am, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 46.22 to 9901.08. 
Financial shares were mainly mixed. Bank of Ireland dropped 6c to 15.95 while AIB rose 7c to 22.49. Anglo Irish 
Bank fell 16c to 17.47 and Irish Life and Permanent slipped 1c to 20.51. 
 Shares in the construction sector put in a solid performance with the exception of Grafton, which slipped 1c 11.74. 
and McInerney rose 3c to 2.68. Kingspan was up 3c to 22.40. CRH climbed 45c 36.55 as US construction spending 
unexpectedly rose for a third consecutive month in April. The value of construction put in place rose 0.1pc month-
on-month (mom) although total spend was down 2pc on April 2006. Robert Gardiner, analyst at Davy Stockbrokers 
said, "the continued strength of US non-residential construction markets is a clear positive for CRH. The group 
derives 85pc of its US materials sales from non-residential and infrastructure projects and it is currently the number-
one producer of asphalt in the US." Elsewhere, shares at Ryanair climbed 12c to 5.44 and Kerry Group rose 29c to 
22.04. Other notable movers include Fyffes, up 8c to 0.93; DCC, up 4c to 25.74, Irish Continental, up 35c to 20.6.

 Low-cost US domestic carrier Virgin America has secured final regulatory clearance to commence commercial 
operation in the US. The US Department of Transportation has deemed the carrier's revised plan, which was filed in 
January, to be in compliance with laws that limit foreign control of domestic carriers in the US. 
The decision came after the carrier made numerous concessions, including replacing its chief executive to allay 
concerns about the foreign ownership stake of London-based Virgin Group. 
The carrier, based in California, is expected to start service this summer with flights from San Francisco 
International Airport to John F Kennedy International Airport in New York. The German regional court of Bad 
Kreuznach has rejected claims by the German flag carrier Lufthansa that Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair's deal to 
operate from Frankfurt Hahn contravened state-aid rules. The court held that there were no legal grounds for 
Lufthansa's claims.  
Lufthansa lodged its claim with the court and sent a similar complaint to the European Commission about the time 
Ryanair began expanding its commercial relationship with the airport and planned to base up to 18 aircraft there. 
Lufthansa may appeal the decision in the appellate court of the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. n

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary hit the proverbial nail on the head when he suggested that European airlines have to 
waiver the notion of profits and prepare for a fares war in the months ahead. 
We may not be hearing the P word for a while, but the other worrying thing for aviation industry is the A word, or the 
lack of it. Aircraft slots are filling up fast and fears are growing about whether these aircraft will meet the increasing 
demand from airlines. 
Another challenge comes from the president of the International Air Travel Association (Iata), who called on 
manufacturers to start building aircraft with zero carbon emissions. How far this challenge fits in with manufacturers' 
plans is debatable, but they are definitely upping the ante in the production of aircraft. 
Looking at Russia, this market is at an interesting turning point in the production of aircraft. Local player United 
Aircraft Corporation has a joint venture with Airbus to convert narrowbody aircraft and it is believed that this venture 
could extend to the production of narrowbody aircraft. 
Elsewhere in Russia, Sukhoi can aggressively focus on its Superjet 100 project now that it has secured (EURO)100 
million ($135 million) of funding from the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. The programme 
looks set to be an answer to Russia's problems with secondary aircraft from the West. 
The Superjet 100 programme is also giving regional aircraft manufacturers a lot to think about, as revealed at the 
recent Airfinance Journal Regional Aircraft Roundtable. 
There is a lot of talk within this community about the number of aircraft with just minimal seat variations, which 
makes the potential lack of aircraft in the world seem hard to contemplate. The challenge for regional aircraft 
manufacturers is the development of certain regional airports in growing markets such as China, India and Russia. 
But the increasing investment in these secondary airports could bode well for regional aircraft manufacturers. 
China has also made its intentions clear: to make a widebody aircraft to rival the likes of Boeing and Airbus. It is an 
interesting time for the region considering the latest challenge from Iata. Could China produce the first zero carbon 
emissions aircraft? This would certainly lead to sustainable aviation and is something Airfinance Journal is watching 
closely. We are launching the Centre for Sustainable Aviation, a think tank for policy makers, airlines and 
manufacturers. The project will be available online shortly. 
Minding your Ps and... As
Aircraft that are in production will receive support from a variety of banks, particularly those that are centralizing 
their aviation activities in London. These banks have the benefit of a world network and it will not be long before 
more Japanese and Spanish operating leases originate from the City of London. 
London can also bring banks closer to the leasing community, which remains as hot as ever. Some of them are 
doing a series of public and private placements over the next 36 months in order to prepare for the downturn. 
US airlines are also turning over a new leaf by emerging from bankruptcy protection. Airline restructuring plans 
have paid off well and these airlines are poised for profit. 
Hopefully, some of these tidings will filter through to Europe, where airlines are focusing on profit. 
The corporate aircraft market is also moving from strength to strength and is reporting an expanding clientele. But 
like all aircraft, corporate jets will not escape the attentions of those with an interest in aviation policy.

Ryanair said profit jumped 33% to (EURO)401.4 million (£272 million) but that profit growth would slow to 5% for 
the financial year because of increased air passenger duty and airport price increases.   The no frills airline warned 
shareholders to be cautious. Ryanair also said it might be prepared to sell some Aer Lingus Heathrow slots so that 
the European Commission will allow Ryanair's take over bid of the Irish national carrier. Ryanair has also offered to 
sell slots at Dublin airport too in order to overcome the Commission's opposition to the bid.

The Dublin market closed marginally higher today despite a sluggish performance by Bank of Ireland.
Shares in the bank closed almost 3pc, or 45c, lower on profit taking after it this morning posted a 28pc rise in pre-
tax profits to almost E2bn. The results were in line with expectations, however, the lack of an upgrade for the year 
ahead left some analysts underwhelemed.
The group has forecasted earnings per share growth of low-double digit for the 12 months to March 2008.
 "We had expected to upgrade our numbers by a few percent following the results, but this seems very unlikely 
now," Davy's Scott Rankin said. Other shares in the financial sector were mixed with AIB down 8c to 22.43, Anglo 
Irish Bank, up 10c to 17.54, and Irish Life and Permanent down 21c to 20.53. Shares in Ryanair put in a better 
performance, jumping 12c to 5.32. The airline said today that it has bought 27 more Boeing 737-800's valued at 
USD1.9bn. Ryanair is due to publish its full year results on Tuesday. Shares in CRH soared 82c to 36.18 after data 
showed strong cement growth in two of its developing markets. Cement output in Ukraine grew by around 14pc in 
April, leaving year to date growth at 30pc, following growth of 13pc last year. CRH is currently the number three 
cement player in the country and recently announced a E210m investment to upgrade its plant and reduce C02 
emissions. Turkey has also witnessed strong growth in the opening months of the year. Figures released this week 
show that cement output grew by 31.5pc during January and February. Elsewhere in the construction sector, 
Grafton was down 13c to 11.79, while McInerney added 1c to 2.67 and Kingspan jumped 22c to 22.15. 
Housebuilder Abbey closed 10c higher at 10.70. Greencore was one of the days star performers, jumping 13c to 
14.87, after it posted a 31pc rise in profits for the first six months of the year. The results beat expectations by 
around 10pc. Other notable movers included drinks group C and C, up 17c to 12.37, ferries operator Irish 
Continental Group, up 20c to 20.25, and former state airline Aer Lingus, down 8c to 2.85. Insurance group FBD 
Holdings slowed 45c higher at 39.20, while media group UTV climbed 12c to 6.27 and paper packaging group 
Smurfit Kappa fell 29c to 18.99. The overall ISEQ index of Irish closed 6.81 points higher at 9,854.86, buoyed by a 
ISEQ up 6 points as BoI weighs heavy
positive start to the session on Wall Street. Leading US stocks plodded higher as investors reacted warmly to 
another batch of acquisitions, but the mood was muted by a weak reading of the nation's gross domestic product. 
The latest estimate of first-quarter GDP came in at 0.6pc, the Commerce Department said, lower than the average 
economist estimate of 0.8pc and the 1.3pc projected in April. The GDP number was the worst in more than four 
years. "There is slight discomfort among some investors about the stock market surging to record highs amid a 
weak economy," said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors.

Ryanair today said it is closing three routes and cutting back six others to make way for eight new services.
The no frills airline said it will close three routes in November, from Shannon to Bournemouth, Lodz in Poland, and 
Rome.
It also said services between Shannon and Biarritz, Carcassonne, Milan, Murcia, Nantes and Venice will switch to a 
summer-only basis, between April and October, to accommodate the eight new routes from the airport in west 
Ireland.
 The new destinations from Shannon include Birmingham, Dublin, Fuerteventura, Kaunas in Lithuania, Leeds, 
Luton, Riga in Latvia and Tenerife. From November, Ryanair will also increase the frequency of its Edinburgh 
service to daily and Manchester to six times a week. Ryanair said the expansion includes its first domestic route 
from Shannon, to Dublin, and brings the number of destinations offered from the airport to 31. Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary said the airline expects its expanded operation at Shannon to attract 1.7 million 
passengers annually. 'This will deliver a visitor spend of E250m and support 1,700 jobs in the West,' he said. 'In the 
space of just two years, Ryanair has delivered dramatic tourism and economic growth for Shannon and the West as 
promised.'

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said Thursday that it ordered 27 Boeing 737-800s valued

All of the new single-aisle Boeing Co. aircraft will be fitted with technology that reduces fuel burn and carbon dioxide

The list price does not necessarily denote the amount Ryanair will pay, as airlines often negotiate discounts on

"The combination of the lowest per-seat operating cost and the reliability of these Boeing 737-800s will benefit 
millions of additional passengers in the coming five years," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar.
The order brings Ryanair's total firm orders for Boeing 737-800s to 308 and total fleet size including planned

The EU is expected to reject Ryanair's E1.48bn bid for Aer Lingus on competition grounds.
According to a source quoted by Reuters news agency, the EC's competition department has prepared a proposed 
decision to present to the full Commission before a July 4 deadline.
This comes after a market test found Ryanair's latest proposed remedies for competition problems were insufficient.
 Ryanair has already built up a 25pc stake in Aer Lingus. Three days after Aer Lingus floated on the Irish Stock 
Exchange in October Ryanair bought 16pc of the airline and made a E1.48 billion offer to buy the company. At the 
end of March the Commission sent a statement of objections about the bid to Ryanair, saying it is concerned the 
proposed deal would damage competition.

The Nasdaq 100 finished higher Wednesday, as gains by Joy Global Inc., Garmin Ltd., and Biogen Idec Inc. helped 
reverse a decline in the index earlier in the trading session.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 
18.29 points to 1,918.08. The broader Nasdaq composite rose 20.53 points to 2,592.59.
Joy Global shares advanced $4.95, or 9.7 percent, to $55.76 following the company's second-quarter earnings 
report. The heavy equipment maker reported sales and earnings that missed analyst expectations, but investors 
focused Joy Global's higher second-quarter orders.

ISEQ down as Ryanair slump continues

Highlight: Shares in Ryanair slumped by over 2pc today.
Body
Shares in Ryanair slumped by over 2pc today amid speculation that the European Commission is set to reject its 
bid for rival airline Aer Lingus.
The Commission's competition department is reported to have prepared a proposed decision to present to the full 
Commission before a July 4 deadline.
Ryanair made an E1.48 billion bid to buy the former state airline back in October, just days after it floated on the 
Irish Stock Exchange. Shares in Ryanair, which owns a 25pc stake in Aer Lingus, fell 15c to 5.19 on the news. Aer 
Lingus ended the session flat on 2.94.
 The overall ISEQ index of Irish also closed sharply lower, down 71.77 points to 9,848.05. The falls came on the 
back of a 6pc plunge in China's stock market and a slow start on Wall Street. Leading Chinese shares plummeted 
after the government confirmed plans to triple the stamp duty on stock trading. Meanwhile, U.S. investors held back 
ahead of the release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting. Market watchers were hoping that the Fed 
minutes would indicate that policy makers were beginning to lean towards a rate cut by the end of the year. 
Financial shares were some of the worst hit in Dublin with AIB down 16c to 22.51, Anglo Irish Bank down 5c to 
17.44 and Irish Life and Permanent down 26c to 20.74. Bank of Ireland closed 13c lower at 16.47 ahead of the 
release of its full year results tomorrow. CRH led the fallers in the construction sector after its shares were 
downgraded to neutral versus buy by UBS. Grafton slipped 11c to 11.92, while fell 25c to 21.93 and McInerney 
closed unchanged on 2.66. Other notable movers included bookmaker Paddy Power, down 10c to 22.21, food 
group IAWS, down 14c to 18.27, and insurance group FBD Holdings, up 45c to 38.75. Dairy group Donegal 
Creameries added on 5c to 6.95, concrete maker Readymix tacked on 1c to 2.73 and media group UTV jumped 
12c to 6.27. Shares in Glencar Mining made modest progress, jumping 5c to 0.17. The exploration company this 
week reported pre-tax losses of E1.4m for last year, compared with a loss of E700,000 a year earlier. Elsewhere, 
drug maker Elan fell 10c to 14.01 on profit taking after the company said on Tuesday that two U.S. Food and Drug 
ISEQ down as Ryanair slump continues
Administration advisory committees will review its Tysabri multiple sclerosis drug for use in the treatment of Crohn's 
disease. The review will take place at a meeting on July 31. Meanwhile, Trinity Biotech's recent strong run 
continued, climbing 6c to 2.01. The diagnostics firm this week entered into an agreement with the Clinton 
Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI). Trinity Biotech, along with CHAI's Procurement Consortium members, will 
offer its Unigold and Capillus rapid HIV test kits to UNITAID-eligible countries at discounted prices, Goodbody 
analyst, Ian Hunter, said. The agreement might result going forward in significant growth in the volumes of the test 
kits supplied by the company's Irish facilities to developing countries, he added.

Budget airline Air Berlin PLC's first-quarter loss widened, reflecting its acquisition last year of domestic rival airline 
dba, the company said Wednesday.
The Berlin-based company, the third-biggest discount carrier in Europe behind Ryanair and easyJet, lost 41.3 
million euros ($55.8 million) in the first three months of 2007, compared with a loss of 31.1 million euros a year 
earlier.
The company said ongoing costs to integrate dba were a factor.
However, the acquisition of dba in August 2006 helped increase sales by more than 66 percent to 373.1 million 
euros ($504 million), lifted in part by an 11.7 percent increase in passengers on domestic and international routes to 
nearly 4.2 million.
Chief Financial Officer Ulf Huettmeyer said the company remained on the right track.
"Air Berlin has managed to stay on track despite the traditionally weak first quarter in the aviation sector," he said.
Air Berlin operates hundreds of flights from Germany to airports in Europe and North Africa.
Shares of Air Berlin fell 4.4 percent to 17.56 euros ($23.64) Wednesday.

The Dublin market tumbled by almost 1pc today following a slump in Chinese shares earlier this morning.
Chinese share prices in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed sharply lower after the government took further measures 
to cool market by raising the stamp duty on stock trading. 
The sharp falls had a knock-on effect on major bourses around the world.
 Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 88.27 points to 9,831.55. CRH led the fallers, down 
72c to 35.21, after it was downgraded to neutral versus buy by UBS. Elsewhere in the construction sector, Grafton

Body
The Dublin market closed virtually unchanged for the second session running today after the ECB hinted that 
further rate hikes are on the cards.
German Bundesbank chief Axel Weber said that the current cycle of interest rate hikes 'has not reached its end'.
The ECB is expected to raise interest rates to 4pc at its June meeting, while many economists expect at least one 
more rate rise before the end of the year. 'Although we expect this to represent the peak, risks around this forecast 
still lie to the upside,' Goodbody economist, Dermot O'Leary, said.
 The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 7.77 points lower at 9,919.82. The sluggish close came despite sharp gains 
in Anglo Irish Bank and a positive start across the Atlantic. Shares in the institution rose by almost 2.5pc, or 40c, to 
17.50. Other financial shares were mixed, with AIB down 23c to 22.64, Irish Life and Permanent up 6c to 20.23 and 
Bank of Ireland, which is due to publish its full year results on Thursday, down 10c to 16.56. Elsewhere on the 
market, construction shares put in a lacklustre performance with CRH down 23c to 35.96, McInerney down 3c to 
2.66 and Kingspan down 15c to 22.10. Grafton edged 1c higher to 12.03, while housebuilder Abbey was 
unchanged at 10.60. Aer Lingus recovered slightly from its recent rocky patch, climbing 4c to 2.94. The former state 
airline today announced its winter schedule. It is to operate daily direct flights from Shannon to New York and 
Boston again this winter, combined with new flights out of Dublin. Meanwhile, rival airline Ryanair slipped 8c to 5.35 
as investors await its annual results next week. Shares in support services group Newcourt closed unchanged at 
1.70 despite telling shareholders at its AGM today that it had made a positive start to the year. The firm said trading 
for the first four months to the end of April had been significantly ahead compared with the corresponding period 
last year and in line with current market expectations for the 2007 full year. Trading reflects an increased 
contribution from its existing businesses and also acquisitions made during 2006. Other notable movers included 
drug maker Elan, up 4c to 14.22, concrete maker Readymix, up 2c to 2.72, and ferries operator Irish Continental 
Group, up 5c to 20.05. Bookmaker Paddy Power slipped 10c to 22.30, while Total Produce fell 5c to 0.75. 
ECB rate hike hint leaves ISEQ flat
Elsewhere, Blackrock International was also unchanged at 0.51 after it this week confirmed that it has invested 
E14.65m to acquire additional properties in Ireland and the UK. These latest acquisitions bring the total gross value 
of Blackrock's portfolio to E430m, an increase of almost 120pc since listing 12 months ago. Across the Atlantic, 
merger and acquisition talk buoyed sentiment, while investors also focused on US consumer confidence, which 
bounced back unexpectedly in May despite higher gasoline prices that could raise shoppers' worries about inflation. 
The New York-based Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 108.0 in May, up from a 
revised 106.3 in April. Analysts had expected the reading to fall to 104.5. The May reading was the highest since 
March, when the index was at 108.2. The figures reinforced market expectations that the US Federal Reserve will 
not be cutting interest rates any time soon.

UK investigators are studying another incident involving loss of electronic flight instrument displays, this time 
affecting a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 earlier this month. The incident occurred on 13 May after the 737 departed 
London Stansted bound for Stockholm.In a preliminary statement the US National Transportation Safety Board says 
the aircraft experienced a "partial, temporary loss" of flight displays following departure. It returned to Stansted after 
the crew declared a "pan-pan" call. None of the 176 occupants was injured.The NTSB identifies the jet involved as 
EI-DCX, a two-year old example which is owned by the Irish budget carrier. UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch 
investigators have opened an inquiry.The AAIB last year recommended Boeing develop an operating procedure to 
enable crews to cope with electrical problems on 737 aircraft after a battery busbar power failure on an EasyJet 
737-300 led to a gradual loss of instrumentation, including the electronic attitude director indicator and standby 
attitude indicator.In the March 2005 incident during the flight from Nice to London Luton, the EasyJet crew did not 
have a checklist for the situation, but correctly deduced that the main attitude display was being compromised by a 
loss of cooling, and restored it by switching to an alternative cooling system.

Dublin airport disruption averted as baggage handlers agree to new basement work place
Dublin airport disruption averted as baggage handlers agree to new 
basement work place

Baggage handlers at Dublin International Airport agreed Monday to work in a newly built section of terminal, ending 
a standoff that had threatened to disrupt operations at Ireland's major airport.
The breakthrough followed daylong talks between managers of the Aer Lingus airline and leaders of Ireland's 
largest labor union, the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union or SIPTU.
About 400 SIPTU-represented baggage handlers had refused since April to move into the new basement level of 
the airport's lone terminal. Aer Lingus, which shares the jam-packed airport with its rival Ryanair, has developed the 
new lower level to handle departures to Britain and the United States.
SIPTU had demanded that each employee receive an extra €1,000 (US$1,350) a year to compensate for what it 
described as a noisier, hotter and more cramped work space.
But the government's Health and Safety Authority said it had no concerns about the new facility, undercutting the 
union claims.
The union dropped its demands after Aer Lingus managers, led by Chief Executive Dermot Mannion, pledged to set 
up a formal review of all health and safety issues at the new basement site.
"An agreement was reached after a commitment from management to address a number of issues of concern to 
the baggage handlers," said Noel Maguire, manager of SIPTU's Aer Lingus branch.
The deal means the terminal extension, known as Area 14, would open Monday night. Aer Lingus, which currently 
has 34 check-in desks on the main departures level, has set up 25 more desks in the new basement section to 
handle British and U.S. flights, or up to 11,000 passengers a day.
Earlier, Aer Lingus Group PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC both called the baggage handlers' threat an attempt to 
hold them and the traveling public to ransom.
Dublin airport disruption averted as baggage handlers agree to new basement work place
The dispute came to a head Monday after Aer Lingus mailed the protesting baggage handlers a letter over the 
weekend that threatened to begin docking their pay if they refused to report for duty in the new location. SIPTU 
warned this threat, if enforced, could trigger wildcat strike action.
Aer Lingus commercial director Enda Corneille dismissed SIPTU's demands as "a very cynical claim for a thousand 
euros per head increase in salary, and a number of promotions. We are saying enough is enough."
Ryanair, which refuses to negotiate with unions and encourages customers not to check bags, said air travelers 
were "being forced to endure more queues and Third World overcrowding because Dublin airport is a SIPTU-
controlled monopoly."

Managers of the airline Aer Lingus and Ireland's largest labor union opened talks Monday designed to defuse a 
strike threat by baggage handlers.
Aer Lingus Group PLC and its Dublin-based rival, Ryanair Holdings PLC, both called the baggage handlers' threat 
an attempt to hold them and the traveling public to ransom.
The union leaders are demanding annual pay rises of €1,000 (US$1,350) each for more than 400 baggage 
handlers to begin work in a new basement baggage-handling area.
Leaders of the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, known as SIPTU, said baggage handlers 
were being threatened with suspensions without pay unless they begin working immediately in the new basement 
departures area for Aer Lingus flights to Britain and the United States.
The basement area, part of a €15 million (US$20 million) expansion at Dublin's overcrowded airport, was supposed 
to have opened fully in April to relieve overcrowding on the terminal's existing departures floor.
But union chiefs complained that the new work area was smaller, noisier and hotter than the handlers' current work 
place.
SIPTU spokesman Noel Maguire warned Aer Lingus not to dock pay from any workers, a threat contained in a letter 
to the baggage handlers over the weekend.
"If they do, I don't control the outcome, and I don't believe the company can either," Maguire said.
Aer Lingus commercial director Enda Corneille said the company was being "held to ransom." He dismissed the 
union's complaints, saying the company was fully compliant with health and safety laws.
Aer Lingus airline, Ireland's major union in talks to prevent baggage handlers' strike
Aer Lingus, he said, had "been landed with a very cynical claim for a thousand euros per head increase in salary, 
and a number of promotions. We are saying enough is enough."
The Dublin Airport Authority said bags at the airport were being processed normally Monday at the old baggage-
handling site and no flights had been disrupted.
Ryanair, which refuses to negotiate with unions and encourages customers not to check bags, accused SIPTU of 
standing in the way of fixing the myriad problems at Dublin's jam-packed airport.
"Irish passengers are being forced to endure more queues and Third World overcrowding because Dublin airport is 
a SIPTU-controled monopoly," Ryanair charged in a statement.
Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard accused SIPTU of "treating the traveling public with utter contempt."

Shares in Dublin closed slightly higher this evening in line with the rest of Europe in lacklustre holiday trade, with 
Bank of Ireland leading the gainers.
There was little movement as a public holiday in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland and other European financial 
markets kept trading activity to a minimum.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 13.18 points higher at 9927.59.
 Bank of Ireland was the shining light in the financial sector, up 15c to 16.67, as investors await its full year results 
on Thursday. Goodbody Stockbrokers is forecasting pre-tax profits for the full year of E1.706m - up 23pc on the 
previous year. It expects growth rates in its Retail Ireland business of 23pc and growth in Wholesale of 24pc. 
Meanwhile, it is also forecasting earnings per share of 145.4 cent. This would represent growth of almost 23pc. Irish 
Life and Permanent also moved 5c higher to 20.68 ahead of its investor day in London tomorrow. "With only an 
AGM statement a week ago and a full trading statement in three weeks time (June 23), it is unlikely there will be 
much in the way of trading commentary," Goodbody analyst, Eamonn Hughes, said. Anglo Irish Bank put in a 
sluggish performance, falling 5c to 17.10, while AIB closed unchanged at 22.66. McInerney led the way in the 
construction sector, tacking on 10c to 14.00, while Grafton slipped 6c to 12.02 and Kingspan closed flat at 22.25. 
Building materials group CRH added on 1c to 36.20. Tropical fruit distributor Fyffes made a marginal recovery from 
last week's near 11pc slump, climbing 2c to 0.89. The company said last week that it was slashing its profit forecast 
for the full year to E15m, down from its previous prediction of E20m. The main blame was placed on rising fuel 
prices, with analysts warning that there is a danger this could also affect profits in 2008. Drug maker Elan was on of 
the session's biggest fallers, down 51c to 14.18, on profit taking after shares in the company soared by almost 25pc 
last week. Investors were reacting news that the group has finally started phase three clinical trials of its drug for 
Alzheimer's Disease. Meanwhile, it has also been confirmed that Elan and its U.S. partner Biogen Idec have been 
asked to present to an FDA advisory committee on 31 July in support of their application to have Tysabri

recommended for the treatment of Crohn's Disease. No frills airline Ryanair was a notable gainer, up 9c to 5.44. 
Shares in the airline have fallen sharply in recent weeks amid fears over its June figures. Ryanair is due to release 
its full year results next Tuesday. Elsewhere in the airline sector, Aer Lingus was down 5c to 2.90, hit by a row over 
the refusal of up to 350 baggage loaders to relocate to a new check-in area in the basement at Dublin Airport. Other 
notable movers yesterday included United Drug, up 6c to 4.21, Paddy Power, down 7c to 22.40, Irish Continental 
Group, down 30c to 20.50.

Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by turnover, increased its operating profit strongly last year and raised its 
profitability targets for the next three years.
Three years after Air France's takeover of KLM, the Dutch flag-carrier, the group said the first phaseof the merger 
was over and it revealed plans for a "deeper integration" of the strategic functions of the two airlines.
It also announced a three-year Euros 1.4bn (Dollars 1.8bn) cost-cutting programme.
It is maintaining the two separate brands and separate flying operations but said it still expected to achieve 
synergies from the merger of Euros 1bn a year by March 2011, Euros 557m in cost savings and Euros 443m in 
increased revenues.
It had reached Euros 525m by March 2007.
Operating profit rose by 32.5 per cent in the 12 months to the end of March from Euros 936m to Euros 1.24bn while 
turnover rose by 7.6 per cent from Euros 21.5bn to Euros 23bn.
The group announced a60 per cent increase in the dividend from 30 to 48 cents per share.
Jean-Cyril Spinetta, Air France-KLM chief executive, forecast an improvement in operating profit in the year to the 
end of March 2008.
In contrast to recent reports from leading low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet of "softer" market 
conditions, Air-France KLM said there was a "positive trend" in forward passenger bookings, although cargo 
operations were under pressure and had made a loss in the last quarter.
The company said it had placed significant orders for short-haul aircraft with Airbus and for long-haul jets with 
Boeing, largely to replace ageing aircraft.
Deeper integration for Air France -KLM
It said it was also ordering two more A380s, takingits total order from 10 to 12 as part of the settlement of its claim 
against Airbus for penalty payments for the late delivery of the superjumbos.
The settlement has been reflected in lower prices agreed by Airbus both for the two A380s and for some of the 
short-haul aircraft.
It is acquiring 30 A320 family jets, 18 directly from Airbus and 12 via aircraft lessors.
Mr Spinetta said thegroup had hoped to order new generation short-haul jets planned by both Airbus and Boeing in 
the nextdecade.
It has also ordered 18 Boeing 777s, 13 777-300ER passenger jets and five 777-200 freighters, for delivery between 
2009 and 2012 to replace the last 18 747-400 jumbo jets in the Air France fleet.
The eight-member strategic management committee set up in 2004 with equalrepresentation from both airlines is 
being replaced by a 12-member group level executive committee.
Group executives responsible for functions ranging from finance and strategy to networks and marketing, 
commercial, fleet and purchasing and information technology are being appointed.

The City of Derry Airport has been closed by the aviation authority over safety fears.
The closure follows an inspection by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority last week which identified a number of 
problems, including unsuitable temporary repairs to a section of the airport where planes are parked.
Runway drainage was also found to be poor and the airport was found to be lacking an effective bird control plan.
 Ryanair has responded to the suspension of flights by cancelling all its services to and from the airport, while 
British Airways has rescheduled its services to operate instead through Belfast International. The City of Derry 
Airport says it is confident that agreement can be reached to ensure its operational status as soon as possible 
during talks in London later today.

British Airways joins consortium for Iberia bid

British Airways PLC teamed up with a U.S. private equity firm considering a bid for Spain's Iberia SA on Tuesday, 
underlining the carrier's desire to be part of the consolidation taking place in the European airline sector.
BA, the biggest shareholder in Iberia with a 10 percent stake, said it was joining the group compromising TPG 
Capital, Vista Capital de Expansion, Inversiones Ibersuizas and Quercus Equity "to investigate a possible 
consortium offer for Iberia."
TPG, formerly Texas Pacific Group, signed the Spanish partners up to its consortium after making a €3.41 billion 
(US$4.6 billion) preliminary offer for Iberia at the end of March.
BA's decision to join the group is key to its potential success because it holds the right of first refusal over offers for 
a further 30 percent of Iberia.
BA said it will work with TPG to carry out due diligence on Iberia over the next two to three months before deciding 
whether to make a formal offer.
The consortium is making plans as the European airline sector prepares for more access to routes under the long 
awaited "open skies" accord between the United States and the European Union.
The deal, due to come into force on March 30, 2008, will allow airlines to fly from anywhere in the 27-nation 
European Union to any point in the United States, meaning more competition for the four carriers currently allowed 
to fly between the U.S. and London's Heathrow Airport, one of the world's busiest.
British-based airlines British Airways PLC and Virgin Atlantic had enjoyed a joint monopoly along with U.S.-based 
AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines over the lucrative trans-Atlantic routes.
A successful bid for the Spanish carrier would allow BA, which manages flights between the U.K. and Spain with 
Iberia, to hold to Iberia's U.S. landing slots. It would also retain interest in Iberia's profitable Latin American network.
Even without the impetus of Open Skies, the European airline sector has been on a consolidation path.
British Airways joins consortium for Iberia bid
Irish airline Aer Lingus PLC last year fended off a €1.48 billion hostile takeover offer from low-cost airline Ryanair 
Holdings PLC. The Irish government, which owns a quarter of the country's national carrier, fiercely opposed the 
offer and fewer than 1 percent of Aer Lingus shareholders had accepted the Ryanair offer. But Ryanair has said it 
hopes to renew its bid when a European Union probe wraps up.
In Italy, the government has taken a different tack with its national carrier, Alitalia, trying to sell its a controlling 
share or its entire 49.9 percent stake in the airline. Three bidders are in contention and must present binding offers 
by July 2.

Domhnal Slattery made his first fortune in aviation finance, though he remains coy on exactly how many tens of 
millions of euros he received by selling his advisory business, IAMG, to Royal Bank of Scotland in 2001.
The Irish entrepreneur believes he has found a way to make a second fortune by making the glamorous world of 
private jet travel available to the "mass affluent" of Europe.
He says that private jet travel is poised to make the next big leap, with the new generation of cheaper very light jets 
(VLJs) coming on to the market. He is aiming to have the advantages of a first mover in Europe through his start-up 
company JetBird.
Across Europe and the US new ventures are emerging - often called air taxi or air limousine services - to take 
advantage of the arrival of the VLJs. "The economic model for (private) jet travel is about to change because of the 
dramatically reduced costs per seat mile these aircraft offer," Jack Pelton, chief executive of Cessna Aircraft, a 
subsidiary of Textron of the US, said last year.
Advances in small jet engines and avionics and higher volume production rates are set to lower dramatically the 
costs of aircraft acquisition and operation. "This change in economics will allow today's air charter and fractional 
operators to lower their costs and attract a whole new market to their services," he said.
Ireland has been at the forefront of the revolution in commercial aviation wrought by the low cost carriers led by 
Ryanair, and Mr Slattery believes that JetBird can "revolutionise the executive travel market" in a similar manner.
Yesterday the company announced the appointment of Stefan Vilner as chief executive. He was formerly chief 
commercial officer of Sterling Airlines, the Scandinavian low cost carrier, and chairman of the European low fares 
airline association.
Mr Slattery says the JetBird business model will use the operating principles of the low cost commercial carriers in 
order to lower significantly the prices for premium private jet travel.
The group is aiming to develop the first low cost, on-demand private jet service in Europe. It is due to start in April 
2009, when the first aircraft will be delivered. It is currently planning to locate its first two hubs at London Stansted 
Low cost private air travel enterprise spreads its wings JETBIRD
and Cologne/Bonn airports rather than in Switzerland. As the fleet grows, bases will also be developed in 
Switzerland, France, and Italy. According to data from Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control organisation, 
most business aviation traffic in Europe is concentrated roughly along a London/Rome axis, taking in Paris, 
Geneva, Cannes and Milan along the way.
JetBird will have a contained network of around 75 cities for the early years of its operations, although it will be able 
to operate to and from more than 800 European destinations, with flights typically of 60-90 minutes duration.
The group has decided to seek its air operators certificate (AOC) in Ireland, so that it will be regulated by the Irish 
aviation authorities, which have great experience of the low cost carrier model through the growth of Ryanair.
Mr Slattery believes he will be able to offer a traditional private jet premium service but at a much lower price, 
comparable to current business class travel, and costing less than 50 per cent of existing branded private jet 
services.
If NetJets Europe, by a wide margin the biggest operator of private jets in Europe, charges Euros 5,000 an hour, 
JetBird will charge Euros 2,500, says Mr Slattery.
The group will be the launch customer in Europe for the all-new Embraer Phenom 100, which is due to enter 
service from mid-2008. It has placed a firm order for 50, with options for another 50, and is due to take the first 
delivery in April 2009. The Phenom 100, which has a catalogue price of Dollars 2.98m at January 2005 prices, will 
seat four passengers and have a range of 1,160 nautical miles (2,148kms).
Mr Slattery says that JetBird will take up all 100 orders and options over a period of five years, and he expects to 
reach agreement with a leading US lessor on operating lease finance for the first 25 by September.
JetBird has also reached an agreement in principle with Canada's CAE, a leading supplier of full flight aircraft 
simulators, for the provision of pilots and training services. CAE has formed a joint venture with Embraer to support 
the introduction of the Phenom jets.
The start-up financing for JetBird has come from Claret Capital, a Dublin-based private investment company, of 
which Mr Slattery is chairman and managing partner and which has been formed to manage the private wealth of 
four Irish families including the Slatterys.

JetBird, the Dublin group aiming to be the first pan-European low-cost operator of executive jets, is negotiating to 
locate its first operating bases at London Stansted and Cologne/Bonn.
The group, founded by Domhnal Slattery, the Irish entrepreneur and financier, is expected to announce today that it 
has recruited its first chief executive in Stefan Vilner, chief commercial officer of Sterling Airlines, the Scandinavian 
low-cost carrier.
The appointment is the latest indication of JetBird's intent to transform the European private jet market by 
introducing a much lower cost air taxi service. It aims to lead its operations from several hubs across Europe to a 
network of about 75 airports. It plans later hubs in France, Italy and Switzerland as it seeks to bring lessons from 
the operating models of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet to the private jet market.
Mr Slattery, formerly managing director of the structured asset finance business of Royal Bank of Scotland, believes 
he will be able to offer traditional private jet premium service at a much lower price, comparable to business class 
travel and costing less than 50 per cent of existing branded private jet services.
Several start-up operators in the US and Europe are seeking to exploit the cheaper very light jets (VLJs) coming on 
to the market from aircraft makers including Embraer, of Brazil, and Cessna and Eclipse, of the US.
According to Cessna, the economic model for private jet travel is changing because of the much reduced costs 
offered by such aircraft. Advances in small jet engines and avionics and higher volume production rates are 
lowering the costs of both aircraft acquisition and operation.
London Executive Aviation, one of the leading UK private jet charter operators, has placed the largest European 
order for the Cessna Mustang.
Patrick Margetson-Rushmore, LEA chief executive, said the group expected to be able to cut the entry price of jet 
chartering by up to25 per cent via the use of the new class of VLJs, which would "increase the cross over of jet 
chartering from business use to leisure".
JetBird targets Stansted base
Air Partner, the world's leading air charter broker, will announce today that it is increasing its investment in the 
booming business jet sector in London, through the development of a "high security private jet enclave" with 
hangars and maintenance facilities at Biggin Hill airport, 14 miles south of the City of London.
David Savile, chief executive of Air Partner, said that Biggin Hill was London's last remaining non-slot regulated 
airport and was much closer to the financial centre than the rival business aviation airport in Farnborough, 
Hampshire.

Just after 1100, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 80.01 points to 9,747.93.
Shares in Elan soared by an impressive 13pc, or 1.58c, to 13.28 after it said it will conduct joint trials on the drug 
with its partner, global biotech firm, Wyeth.
 The company said the decision to initiate a Phase 3 clinical program of their lead immunotherapeutic candidate, 
Bapineuzumab (AAB-001), was based on the seriousness of the disease and the totality of what the companies 
have learned from their immunotherapy programs, including a scheduled Interim look at data from an ongoing 
Phase 2 study, which remains blinded. The drug will be used for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate 
Alzheimer's. No conclusion about the Phase 2 study can be drawn until the study is completed and the final data 
are analysed and released in 2008. Elsewhere on the market, shares in Aer Lingus were up 5c to 3.00, while CRH 
jumped 30c to 34.80 and Irish Continental Group added on 50c to 21.50. Ryanair was up 6c to 5.35, while Paddy 
Power tacked on 13c to 21.70.

Virgin America yesterday won its 17-month battle to launch domestic US airline services, although the carrier faces 
a tougher market and the challenge of replacing its chief executive.
The US transportation department gave its formal approval to the SanFrancisco-based carrier, reversing its earlier 
opposition after the company agreed to distance itself from Sir Richard Branson and the Virgin Group - which 
retains a 25 per cent stake - and make other changes to its business model to meet foreign investment rules.
The fledgling carrier's plans had become mired in domestic and international disputes over aviation reform, and its 
delayed launch comes at a time when airline executives have expressed concern about overcapacity and softening 
demand in a US market recovering from five years of heavy losses.
Virgin America is one of three start-ups this year. Skybus, which is modelled on European low-cost carrier Ryanair, 
will launch services from its Ohio base next week - using some aircraft leased from Virgin America - while 
ExpressJet recently started its own flights to under-served cities.
The Virgin America model focuses on larger cities, with initial flights from San Francisco to New York, adding Los 
Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas and Washington DC in its first year, with a further 25 cities being considered in its 
first five years. The airline has ordered 33 Airbus A319s, and has already received nine of the aircraft.
While Virgin America's financial backers have remained with the project in spite of the delays, the airline faces the 
challenge of replacing Fred Reid as chief executive within six months. The former Delta Air Lines and Lufthansa 
executive was recruited by Sir Richard in 2004 to head the project, but was viewed by regulators as being 
"beholden" to the UK entrepreneur and overseas investors.
Ron Reber, chief executive of SkyWest, a US regional carrier, is viewed by analysts as one possible replacement 
for Mr Reid, although the airline declined to comment on its succession plan.

Some airlines and tour operators are taking their customers for a ride by not being fully upfront about the total cost 
of their deals.
Holiday and travel suppliers are supposed to include all fixed non-optional costs, such as taxes and fuel 
supplements, in their advertisements. But the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said in February that many in the 
industry were ignoring this requirement.
In an example cited by the OFT, the price of a flight from the UK to Barcelona advertised at Pounds 19.99 was 
more than doubled when all fixed non-optional costs were included.
Leaving information about fixed non-optional costs - including credit card or debit card fees if consumers have no 
other way of paying - is misleading, says the OFT.
The industry was given three months to clean up its act by ensuring that all fixed non-optional costs were clearly 
spelt out in advertisements.
But as the deadline passed last week, a minority of airlines, tour agents and operators had not heeded this warning.
The OFT and the Association of British Travel Agents are now taking action against the "minority" who are ignoring 
the advertising code, but will not name and shame them until they have been issued with enforcement orders.
However,Travelsupermarket.com, a price comparison website, found variation in the way big airlines are advertising 
their deals.
Ryanair and EasyJet did not include credit or debit card charges in their ads in last weekend's papers but BMI Baby 
and Flybe did, according to the website. Monarch said conditions applied but its advertisement did not make it clear 
where these could be viewed. This research has now been forwarded to the OFT.

Highlight: Shares in Irish Life and Permanent soared by over 4pc today as the ISEQ index moved higher.
Body
Shares in Irish Life and Permanent soared by over 4pc today after Ireland's largest mortgage lender issued a 
positive trading update.
The institution told its AGM in Dublin this morning that it is still forecasting low to mid-teens growth in pre-tax 
operating profit this year, despite fears over a continuing slowdown in the Irish property market.
Shares in the company have fallen sharply during recent months as rising interest rates and uncertainty over stamp 
duty has raised uncertainty about the market. However, today's update was welcomed by investors with shares 
jumping 90c to 20.40.
 The gains helped lift the overall market higher, with the Iseq index closing 89.91 points higher at 9,667.92. Shares 
closed firmer, reflecting a strong showing on Wall Street boosted by better-than-expected U.S. consumer sentiment 
data. The preliminary Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment for May came in at 88.7. Wall 
Street had expected the reading would be unchanged from April at 87.1. Back in Dublin, pharmaceutical group Elan 
ended the week on a positive note, with shares soaring an impressive 5pc, or 57c, to 11.70. Meanwhile, Bank of 
Ireland added on 26c to 16.50 and Anglo Irish Bank jumped 12c to 16.52. AIB closed marginally higher, up 5c to 
22.40. Grafton led the way in the construction sector, tacking on 16c to 11.66, while CRH added on 6c to 34.46 and 
Kingspan jumped 12c to 21.20. Housebuilder McInerney closed 3c higher at 14.00. Irish Continental Group turned 
in an impressive performance, climbing 50c to 21.00, after it was confirmed that One51 and the Doyle Group are 
almost finished due diligence on the company and will make a formal offer soon. The consortium, which owns 
20.5pc of ICG's equity , said discussions are continuing with the independent directors (of ICG) in order to progress 
its possible offer for ICG for 'not less than E20.75 per share'. This is the highest price at which the two shipping 
companies bought ICG shares, and under ISEQ rules they will have to offer the remaining shareholders at least this 
amount. The consortium said a further announcement will be made in due course. Other notable movers included 
Smurfit Kappa, up 84c to 20.88, Paddy Power, up 18c to 21.57, and Kerry, up 56c to 22.18. Elsewhere, Ryanair's 
ISEQ closes 1pc higher on IL&P, Elan
miserable week continued, with shares falling 2pc. Shares have taken a tumble in recent days after it announced 
plans to give-away one million free seats on its website. The offer is expected to cost the airline millions of euros as 
it shoulders the cost of taxes, charges and credit card booking fees. A rush for the flights caused the airline's 
website to crash on Thursday. Analysts say the move could rebound on Ryanair if passengers are unable to log on 
or find any free flights, while others might book, but not bother to travel because they had paid nothing. This would 
mean that Ryanair will lose out on ancillary revenue. Shares in Ryanair ended the session 10c lower at 5.30 this 
evening, taking its losses for the week to 4.5pc.

Ryanair's miserable week on the Dublin market continued this morning, with shares falling almost 2pc.
Shares tumbled again today following reports that the airline's website crashed yesterday as internet users

Shares in European airlines, in euro terms, have soared 82 per cent in the past two years, propelled by resilient 
passenger demand and rising yields. There are signs, though, of clouds on the horizon.
Demand for Ryanair and EasyJet flights seems to have softened after hefty price increases. And budget carrier 
Vueling has warned about yields in its domestic Spanish market.
It is not only the low-cost airlines that are affected. British Airways has already warned of lower demand from US 
leisure travellers. And, as crude prices have risen again, neither BA nor Air France have fully replaced previous fuel 
surcharges, suggesting they are nervous of discouraging passengers with higher prices. It seems likely that, after 
two years, airlines' ability to pump up prices without affecting demand is finally coming to an end.
There are other reasons to believe the cycle may be at a peak. Almost without exception, airlines have increased 
capacity. Network carriers in the US, facing a slowdown in demand and ferocious competition, are taking aircraft out 
of their domestic market and putting those with the range to fly long-haul on to the Atlantic route. Meanwhile, buyers 
are circling Spain's Iberia and Alitalia, while all-business-class operators Silverjet and Maxjet are planning to raise 
new equity. With profits already higher than at any previous cyclical peak, airlines are clearly hoping to take 
advantage of the historically rich valuations that these imply.
As JPMorgan points out, 25 years of industry history says that a third year of rising yields does not happen. 
Earnings growth over the past two years has not exactly been easy to achieve, as BA, which reports its latest 
earnings today, can testify. But all the signs are that it will be a lot harder going forward.

Highlight: The scramble to take up Ryanair on its offer for a million free seats overloaded the airline's Website.
Body
The scramble to take up Ryanair on its offer for a million free seats on dozens of its routes overloaded the airline's 
Website for a period yesterday.
Analysts said the move could rebound on Ryanair if passengers were unable to log on or find any free flights, while 
others might book, but not bother to travel because they had paid nothing.
The offer is expected to cost the airline millions of euros as it shoulders the cost of taxes, charges and credit card 
booking fees. Ryanair has previously advertised "free seats" - but these did not include such add-on costs.
 The Irish carrier expects to recoup some of these costs through ancillary services such as car hire and hotel 
bookings through its site and from in-flight sales, such as food and drink, duty free goods and scratchcards. 
Ryanair's move is seen as a pre-emptive move to take market share and comes as no-frills airline experience a fall-
off in bookings as capacity increases and competition intensifies.

Irish airline Aer Lingus PLC said Thursday it has introduced six new European routes to its winter schedule and 25 
new flights a week from Dublin and Cork on existing routes.
Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, which last year attempted to buy Aer Lingus, announced new routes of its 
own, saying it was adding nine new routes from Milan.
Aer Lingus said that from the end of October, new services from Dublin to Helsinki, Finland; Bucharest, Romania; 
Agadir, Morocco and Funchal, Spain will come into operation, in addition to the restarting of services from Dublin to 
Copenhagen and Cork, Ireland to Munich, Germany.
Ryanair said that the nine new routes from Milan to locations including Alghero and Cagliari in Sardinia; Bari, Italy; 
Gothenburg, Sweden and Porto, Portugal would start in December.
Aer Lingus was the target of a €1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) hostile takeover offer last year by Ryanair. The Irish 
government, which owns a quarter of the country's national carrier, fiercely opposed the offer and fewer than 1 
percent of Aer Lingus shareholders had accepted the Ryanair offer.
Earlier this month, the European Commission extended until July 4 its deadline to rule on Ryanair's bid. Europe's 
largest no-frills airline had withdrawn the takeover offer in December when the EU's executive arm launched its 
investigation, but has said it hopes to renew its bid when the EU probe wraps up.

Shares in Ryanair made a partial recovery from yesterday's heavy losses this morning, as the ISEQ index edged 
towards the 9600 level.
Just before 1130, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 33.56 points to 9,597.99.
Having plummeted almost 5pc yesterday, Ryanair made a steady start to the session today, climbing 11c to 5.42. 
The stock was hit by a tentative forecast from its deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley, that average passenger 
yields could fall by as much as 10pc in June as a result of its recent free seat give-away.
 Aer Lingus also opened strongly, climbing 4c to 2.95 after it today added six new routes to its winter schedule and 
twenty-five new flights a week from Dublin and Cork on existing routes. Elsewhere, Boundary Capital continued its 
impressive first week on the market, climbing 4c to 1.23. Shares in the investment firm have now risen almost 25pc 
since they joined the Dublin market on Tuesday. In the financial sector, AIB was down 7c to 22.33, while Bank of 
Ireland fell 3c to 16.27. Irish Life and Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank were both in the black, adding on 4c to 19.54 
and 9c to 16.45 respectively. Other notable movers included DCC, up 28c to 24.89, Grafton, up 23c to 11.55, and

Boundary Capital's impressive start to life on the Dublin market continued today as it took its gains for the week to 
over 20pc.
Shares in the investment company, which floated at E1 on Tuesday, closed 3c higher at 1.22.
Those gains helped lift the ISEQ index of Irish shares 13.58 points higher to 9,578.01.
 The market had risen as high as 9,635.00 earlier in the session, before falling back on mixed economic news from 
the U.S. Wall Street was trading lower after the Labour Department reported first-time claims for unemployment fell 
last week for the fifth straight week. This suggested the employment market is stronger than many economists 
anticipated - good news for consumer spending, but worrisome for investors hoping for an interest rate cut later in 
the year. Leading U.S. stocks were also hit by a bigger-than-expected decline in leading economic indicators, which 
bolsters the argument for a rate cut. Back in Dublin, the financials put in a mixed performance, with AIB up 8c to 
22.40, Bank of Ireland down 6c to 16.23 and Anglo Irish Bank up 4c to 16.40. Shares in Irish Life and Permanent 
rose a tentative 3c to 19.53 as investors look for an update on trading so far this year at tomorrow's AGM. Ryanair 
made a modest recovery from its sharp falls earlier in the week, rising 4c to 5.35. Shares in the airline plummeted 
almost 5pc on Wednesday following a tentative forecast from its deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley, that 
average passenger yields could fall by as much as 10pc in June as a result of its recent free seat give-away. Aer 
Lingus also edged higher, up 4c to 2.95 after it confirmed the addition of six new routes to its winter schedule and 
twenty-five new flights a week from Dublin and Cork on existing routes. In the construction sector, CRH led the way, 
climbing 27c to 34.86, while Kingspan added on 15c to 21.08 and Grafton tacked on 18c to 11.50. McInerney 
slipped 12c to 13.97. Other notable movers included DCC, up 24c to 24.85, Irish Continental, down 15c to 20.50, 
and Paddy Power, down 21c to 21.39. Smurfit Kappa tacked on 30c to 19.88. Elsewhere, Bulmers manufacturer C

week after it announced the sale of its soft drinks division to Britvic for just under E250m. Rumours also persist that 
ISEQ up 13pts as Boundary keeps climbing
C and C is also looking to sell off its spirits and liqueurs business to allow it to concentrate solely on developing its 
cider brands. Analysts have predicted that this streamlining of the business could make it a more attractive takeover 
target. Meanwhile, shares in dairy group Glanbia fell 5c to 3.79 after it's positive trading update on Wednesday. The 
company said it is on course to meet market expectations for the full year after a particularly strong first half. 
Investors were left slightly concerned after management cautioned that the current upward swing increases the 
chances of a correction in the future. Goodbody said it was leaving its forecasts for Glanbia unchanged, but said 
that, if anything, it feels that there is upside on its 13pc earnings per share forecast.

European shares lost ground Wednesday as airlines stocks came under pressure and investors eyed mixed 
earnings from Credit Agricole and Vivendi.
The U.K. FTSE 100 index closed down 0.1 percent at 6,559.50, the German DAX Xetra 30 index lost 0.3 percent to 
7,481.25 and the French CAC-40 index declined 0.2 percent to 6,017.91.
Pointing out that European equity markets have been trading strongly recently, Mike Lenhoff at Brewin Dolphin 
Securities said, "I think we're marking a bit of time. The markets have had a good run and are hesitant to move 
higher at this stage."
Air France-KLM fell 2.1 percent after UBS downgraded the company to neutral from buy, saying there's not enough 
upside left. EasyJet and Ryanair shares declined more than 1.8 percent.
Chipmakers Infineon Technologies and STMicroelectronics came under pressure after U.S. peer Applied Materials 
posted a weak outlook Tuesday. Infineon shares lost 3.2 percent and STMicro shares slipped 1.8 percent.
Automakers were mostly higher, with Volkswagen up 1.8 percent and Porsche rising 2.3 percent. Both have risen 
recently amid reports that Porsche is looking to buy Volkswagen.
France's Credit Agricole lost 4.1 percent after reporting a 92 percent increase in first-quarter net income, driven by 
gains from Italian investments. But after excluding those gains, its profit didn't meet estimates, according to analysts 
at J.P. Morgan.
Arcelor Mittal, the world's largest steelmaker, saw its shares slip 1 percent after recent gains. The firm posted a 41 
percent increase in first-quarter profit and said higher prices would boost earnings in the second quarter.
Telefonica, Europe's second-largest telecommunications company, lost 0.4 percent after it posted an 8 percent rise 
in quarterly profit, fueled by strong demand for broadband services in Spain and the recent acquisition of Britain's 
O2.

The U.K.'s biggest listed property company, Land Securities, lost 4.1 percent after it joined other U.K. property 
companies in warning that growth is slowing across some segments of the property-investment market.
Zurich Financial Services gained 2.1 percent after it posted a 71 percent rise in first-quarter net income, above 
analyst forecasts, after all of its businesses recorded strong growth.
And Vivendi shares rose 1.1 percent after reporting first-quarter adjusted net income rose 23 percent.
Shares in Swiss private banking group Julius Baer rose 4.4 percent amid speculation that Deutsche Bank is 
interested in buying the group. Deutsche Bank shares lost 0.8 percent.
Nokia shares rose 1 percent after Deutsche Bank raised the mobile phone giant's price target and kept a buy rating, 
citing the company's market share prediction and expectations for "healthy" average selling prices.

Body
Shares in Ryanair slumped by over 5pc today after the airline indicated that average yields could fall by as much as 
10pc in June.
Investors pulled back after Ryanair's deputy Chief executive, Michael Cawley, indicated that yields are likely to be 
hit by its new one million free seat give-away, announced this morning. The airline is offering to pay all taxes, fees 
and charges on one million flights across Europe. 
With passengers not paying anything for the flights, Cawley admitted that it will suffer a net loss from the promotion, 
with yields likely to soften during the month of June.
 The news came as bad news for investors after the airline announced earlier this month that yields fell 2pc year on 
year during April to 83pc. Since then, shares in Ryanair have fallen by more than 15pc. Shares closed 29c lower at 
5.30 last night. Dolmen analyst, Stuart Draper, said Ryanair's share price is very sensitive to movements in yields, 
but said he is still recommending the stock to investors. He added that the expected fall in yields is by no means a 
sign of weakness in Ryanair, and predicted that The share price will recover from its recent dip over the coming 
weeks". The overall Dublin market was also slipped into the red. The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 45.44 points 
lower at 9,564.43. Financial shares were mixed with Anglo Irish Bank down 9c to 16.36, AIB unchanged on 22.40, 
Bank of Ireland up 24c to 16.30 and Irish Life and Permanent down 50c to 19.50 ahead of its AGM on Friday. The 
market's newest recruit, Boundary Capital, was one of few major gainers, jumping 5pc, or 6c, to 1.19. Shares in the 
investment group have soared an impressive 18pc since it made its debut on the Irish Stock Exchange on Tuesday. 
The one euro per share placing is believed to have been over-subscribed three times. Elsewhere, shares in CRH 
fell 31c to 34.59 following the release of a mixed reading on the U.S. housing sector. Commerce Department data 
showed that housing starts in the U.S. fell to their lowest level in 17 years during April. Grafton and McInerney were 
also in the red, down 8c to 11.32 and 9c to 14.09 respectively, while Kingspan bucked the trend, climbing 47c to

5c to 19.58. Fencing and scaffolding group Siteserv fell 5c to 0.91. Meanwhile, business support services group 
DCC continued its recent struggle, falling 49c to 24.61. The company said on Monday that pre-tax profits rose 
almost 17pc to E61.8m last year. However, investors would appear to have been left disappointed by the group's 
forecast for high single-digit percentage growth in operating profits during the current financial year.

A German court has thrown out a challenge by Lufthansa against Ryanair's operation at Frankfurt Hahn airport.
Ryanair said the regional court of Bad Kreuznach had rejected claims by the German flag carrier that the Irish 
airline's deal to operate from the airport near Frankfurt contravened state aid rules.
A spokesman for the court said there were no legal grounds for Lufthansa's demands.
 Ryanair claimed Lufthansa has consistently tried to block competition from the Dublin-based carrier at Hahn, 
including attempting to stop it using the name of the airport when Ryanair opened its second continental base there 
in 2002. It said Lufthansa lodged its claim with the court and sent a similar complaint to the European Commission 
around the time Ryanair said it was expanding its partnership with Hahn and planned to base up to 18 aircraft there. 
Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs and company secretary, Jim Callaghan, said: 'We are delighted with today's 
ruling of the court in Bad Kreuznach, which dismissed all of Lufthansa's spurious claims regarding Ryanair's 
commercial deal with Frankfurt Hahn. 'This latest legal action by Lufthansa shows how desperate they are to block 
competition from Ryanair.' A Lufthansa spokesman said it may appeal against the decision in the appellate court of 
the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Ryanair will increase its fleet of Barcelona based aircraft's to 9 from 7 to facilitate new routes to Billund, Bratislava, 
Fez, Granada, Graz, Hamburg, Malta, Marrakesh and Wroclaw, the company said in a statement.
The new routes will commence in October.
 Ryanair said the expansion means it will deliver 5 million passengers per year at Barcelona Girona. Michael 
O'Leary said Ryanair intends to be Spain's leading carrier within five years. Meanwhile, a German court has thrown 
out a challenge by Lufthansa against Ryanair operation at Frankfurt Hahn airport. Ryanair said the regional court of

Highlight: Ryanair has stepped up its fight against softening yields in the airline sector.
Body
Ryanair has stepped up its fight against softening yields in the airline sector by offering to pay all taxes, fees and 
charges on one million flights across Europe.
The moves comes just one week after the no-frills airline put more than 10 million seats up for sale at between E10 
and E20.
It has also said last week that it will pay double the difference to anyone booking with Ryanair, but who finds a lower 
fare with another airline.
 Of the one million free seats launched today, 150,000 will be available on Irish routes. With passengers not paying 
anything for the flights, the airline admitted that it will suffer a net loss from the promotion. However, it hopes to re-
coup some of those losses by charging extra for baggage, priority check-in and ancillary items such as food and 
drink on board. The free seats will be available on the Ryanair website until midnight on Monday. Billed by the 
airline itself as "a war on high fares", the give-away is more likely to be an attempt by the airline to create demand 
by flooding the market with cheap tickets. Ryanair, like many other major airlines, has recently reported a fall in seat 
occupancy. Traffic statistics for April showed that Ryanair's load factor - the number of seats filled - fell to 83pc, 
down from 85pc in April 2006. Following the release of those figures, the airline's chief executive, Micheal O'Leary, 
admitted that seats were becoming harder to fill. He said higher charges at Dublin Airport and at airports in the UK 
have had an impact on load factors and "given rise to a softer yield environment". "We expect this weakness in load 
factors and softer yields to continue through the first and second quarters of 2007," Mr O'Leary said last week. 
Other airlines such as Easyjet and Aer Lingus have also both admitted to falling yields over recent months.

Body
Shares in drinks group C and C moved sharply higher for the second consecutive session today after it this week 
confirmed the sale of its soft drinks arm.
The cider manufacturer announced on Monday that it has agreed a deal to sell the division to Britvic for just under 
E250m. Reports suggest that C and C is also planning to sell off its liqueurs and spirits distribution business, 
leaving it free to focus on cider.
Shares in the company closed 2pc, or 25c, higher at 12.65 in Dublin, taking its gains for the week so far to over 5pc.
 Those gains helped the overall market modestly higher, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares ending the session 
35.75 points higher at 9,609.87. A positive opening on Wall Street lifted investor sentiment, where mild U.S. inflation 
figures pushed the Dow Jones industrials index over the 13,400 mark for the first time. Investors were encouraged 
to continue buying after the Labour Department reported prices paid by consumers rose less than expected in April, 
and indicated that inflation may be easing as the economy continues to cool. This raised hopes that the Federal 
Reserve might cut interest rates later this year. Construction shares were boosted by news of a major takeover deal 
in the sector. It was confirmed that British sand and gravel maker Hanson has been bought by Germany's largest 
cement maker Heidelberg for £8bn. Davy analyst Barry Dixon said the deal was "positive for valuation levels in the 
sector". Shares in CRH soared by over 2pc on the news, up 85c to 34.90, while Kingspan jumped 11c to 20.51. 
McInerney and Grafton both slipped into the red, down 2c to 14.18 and 3c to 11.25 respectively. The financials put 
in a lacklustre performance, with Anglo Irish Bank down 8c to 16.42, Bank of Ireland down 5c to 16.02 and AIB 
unchanged at 22.40. Irish Life and Permanent managed to make slight headway, tacking on 31c to 20.01 ahead of 
its AGM in Dublin on Friday where it is expected to give a trading update for the year so far. Shares in business 
support services group DCC fell lower, down 22c to 25.05. The falls came despite the firm this week posting a 17pc 
rise in profits for the past year to E161.8m. Management at the company also said that it could spend as much as 
E1bn on acquisitions over the coming years if the sale of its 49pc stake in Manor Park Homebuilders goes ahead as 
C&C up again as ISEQ closes higher
planned. Other notable movers included pharmaceutical group Elan, down 27c to 10.75, food group Kerry, down 
22c to 21.58, and bookmaker Paddy Power, up 27c to 21.06. No frills airline Ryanair was up 2c to 5.60, while 
United Drug added on 3c to 4.13 and fencing and scaffolding firm Siteserv tacked on 4c to 0.96. Glanbia was up 
over 1.5pc, or 5c, to 3.80 ahead of its AGM in Kilkenny tomorrow. Shareholders will be looking for an idea of how 
well it has performed in the opening months of the year.

Flybe is considering a foray into continental Europe using the Bombardier Q400 options it placed last week as part 
of a major new order for the type. The rapidly expanding UK carrier has also revealed that it is evaluating the 
Q400X stretch variant of the 78-seat turboprop.Last week Flybe placed a firm order for 15 Bombardier Q400s, plus 
15 options, for delivery over the next two years. This order builds on the airline's existing Q400 commitments, taking 
it to a total of 60 of the type.The aircraft on firm order are to replace some Embraer ERJ-145s that Flybe acquired 
with its purchase of BA Connect. 
Flybe chief commercial officer Mike Rutter says that the 15 additional options may be used to "press ahead with the 
airline's sub-strategy of overseas expansion", with the launch of operations in markets such as France, Scandinavia 
and Spain. Before the BA Connect acquisition, Flybe was considering opening up to five bases in either France or 
Spain. In the chosen market, it was planning to station up to 20 aircraft for deployment on mainly domestic routes."I 
think that we wouldn't be seeking to stay with one [country]," says Rutter. "Our plan would be to initially do one, but 
then to add one per year after that. If you look at what EasyJet and Ryanair have done, it's no more aggressive 
than that."Another option for the carrier is further expansion in the UK market, although Rutter says that such a 
move would require a "structural change" such as the freeing of a carrier's slot portfolio.Rutter says that Flybe will 
take a decision on the offshoot operations around 2009-10, firming the options around the same time. "At the end of 
this we will have a fleet which will be in the region of 71 or 72 Q400s and 16-20 Embraer 195s," he 
says.Meanwhile, Rutter says the airline has had talks with Bombardier about the Q400X, adding that "the concept 
of a 90-seat version of the Q400 is appealing".Flybe is aiming to phase out its Bombardier Q300s, BAe 146s and 
ERJ-145s, leaving it with an E-195 and Q400 fleet by the second quarter of 2009.

The dismal performance of Sports Direct International continued yesterday, with the sportswear retailer closing at 
another low. The shares, which listed at 300p in February, ended 3.5 per cent lower at 206 1/2p, unsettled by 
Friday's profits warning from US rival Foot Locker.
Traders said the shares had also been depressed by a lukewarm research report last week from Merrill Lynch, one 
of the banks that sponsored its flotation.
In the note, Merrill initiated coverage with a "neutral" rating, cut its profit forecasts by 7.5 per cent and said it had 
been unable to obtain any clarification or transparency from management on the dynamics of current trading.
The FTSE 100 fell 10.2 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 6,555.5, dragged down by a weak performance from the mining 
sector. The FTSE 250 struggled to gain 3.8 points to reach 12,037.6.
Market turnover was poor. Although 3.1bn shares changed hands, this was inflated by heavy trading in three Irish 
stocks, Petroceltic, unchanged at 15p, Waterford Wedgwood preference shares, steady at Euros 0.04, and Ryanair, 
unmoved at Euros 5.50. This was caused by investors "rolling over" derivative positions to avoid paying Irish stamp 
duty.
Lonmin was among the biggest fallers in the mining sector, down 3.4 per cent to Pounds 37.90 after UBS removed 
the stock from its "buy" list and advised clients to switch into rival Aquarius Platinum, up 0.5 per cent to Pounds 
15.67. Rumoured takeover target Rio Tinto shed 3.5 per cent to Pounds 35.25, while Antofagasta slipped 2.9 per 
cent to 536 1/2p and Anglo American lost 2.1 per cent to Pounds 28.74.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, advanced2 per cent to 908p after UBS upgraded it to "buy". Setting a 
Pounds 10.50 target price, analyst Polo Tang said the recent flurry of deals in the media sector - in particular 
Thomson's sale of its education business - had set new valuation benchmarks for all of Pearson's assets.
"If we valued Pearson's education assets at 19x 2008 ebitda (the same multiple paid for Thomson's education 
business), this would imply a valuation of Pounds 12.30," it said.
Sports Direct's fall continues with new post-flotation low
ITV eased 0.7 per cent to 118.7p in spite of talk that it could be a takeover target for RTL. Any deal would require 
the backing of BSkyB, up 1 per cent to 632p. The satellite broadcaster is ITV's biggest shareholder with a 17.9 per 
cent holding
Analysts also pointed out that a deal would run into regulatory problems unless RTL could find a buyer for Channel 
5
Nonetheless, traders believe it should be possible to structure a bid to get round these problems.
Hanson moved up 2 per cent to Pounds 10.57 on talk HeidelbergCement could offer as much as Pounds 11 a 
share for the UK aggregates group.
Britvic, the soft drinks company that makes Tango, was the best performer in the FTSE 250. Its shares rose 4.5 per 
cent to 371p on renewed hopes of a bid from Permira, the private equity group and 14 per cent shareholder.
A deal to buy the soft drinks business of C&C Group, up 3.5 per cent to Euros 12.4, for Euros 249m also helped the 
shares.
Abbot Group, the oilfield services company, added 3.9 per cent to 278 1/4p on hopes it could be a takeover target 
for US rival Nabors.
In a note on Friday, Cazenove upgraded its rating on Abbot to "outperform" on the grounds that it was one of the 
few companies that would give Nabors the international footprint it desires.
"Abbot's premium valuation may be considered a barrier to M&A. In our view this is wrong: we show that an 
acquisition of Abbot at a 30 per cent premium could still be earnings enhancing for Nabors," Cazenove said, setting 
a fair value of 320p.
SThree, the IT recruitment consultant, improved 2.8 per cent to 511 1/2p after Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander 
upgraded its top of the range 2008 estimates by 8 per cent, citing the number of vacancies on IT job websites.
Findel, the home shopping and educational supplies group, rose 1 per cent to 674p on talk that Thursday's results 
could help its shares, which are down 10 per cent in the past three months.
Intercontinental Hotels Group added 1 per cent to Pounds 12.63 after Ellerman, the investment vehicle of the 
Barclay Brothers, declared an increased holding of9.1 per cent.

WROCLAW, Poland Until a couple of months ago, I didn't even know how to pronounce the name of this city in 
southwest Poland. Nor did Poland appear on the list of countries I intended someday to visit.
Yet here I am, very surprised. Wroclaw (pronounced VROH-slav) turns out to be one of the jewels of Europe. With 
its medieval center highlighted by a vast town square, a 13th-century cathedral and 30-odd cultural festivals each 
year, Wroclaw is a tourist's delight particularly since there are practically no lines to get into anything. Even the 
food, quite good, belies the reputation of Polish cuisine for being heavy and greasy. I'm staying in a small old hotel, 
tastefully restored, its restaurant in a vaulted medieval cellar and it costs only $80 to fly here from London.
A whole new Europe is opening up to travelers thanks to the continuing expansion of the continent's low-cost 
airlines. Led by Dublin-based Ryanair and London-based easyJet, a flock of new airlines are now flying to literally 
dozens of once hard-to-get-to European cities. Ryanair alone says it has increased the number of smaller cities it 
serves by roughly 35 percent in the past two years, most recently adding Zadar, Croatia, and Maribor, Slovenia.
In France, there's the ancient walled town of Carcassonne in the Pyrenees. Striking beaches and craggy hills mark 
the town of Olbia in northern Sardinia. Split, Croatia, sits on the Dalmatian coast and dates back to ancient Roman 
times. Girona, Spain, offers gastronomic adventures rivaling those of Barcelona.
These locations also offer better value, certainly compared to European capitals this summer, where the weak 
dollar makes visiting an expensive proposition. Near the ancient hill town of Bergamo, Italy, $300 buys a room in a 
lakeside villa during the peak months of summer. The same rate gets only a basic room in Rome. Bergamo is an 
hour's drive from Milan, but when I saw this town, with its nearby lakes and mountains, any temptation to go to 
Milan quickly faded.
A dearth of tourists also adds to the charm. Right now, Americans are a scarce commodity on the planes of 
discounters, particularly more obscure ones like Wizz Air (Hungarian), TUIfly (German) and Cimber Air (Danish). At 
these small towns, you can get in and out of the airport in minutes, just the way travel used to be decades ago.
The new way to do Europe: Discount air routes to vibrant but little-known cities
Another upside is being able to take an easy side-trip from a major hub. Visitors to London, for example, can see 
Wroclaw, too, by taking a two-hour flight on Ryanair. Before the airline added the route, the same trip would have 
taken at least five hours, including a transfer in Warsaw.
But be prepared for inconveniences that are so often part of these airlines keeping costs down. Discounters often 
use outlying airports instead of major hubs Paris Beauvais Tille Airport, for example, versus Charles de Gaulle. 
Some, like Ryanair, have tighter restrictions on how much baggage you can check before paying an excess charge. 
The infrastructure in some destinations has yet to catch up with the tourism influx; arrivals at Bergamo airport have 
more than quintupled since 2002, to 4.6 million last year, but new hotels there haven't opened as quickly.
The boom in low-cost carriers has already reshaped travel in Europe though the market has so far been mostly 
Europeans taking holidays and planning bachelor parties. Large carriers like British Airways have been forced to 
drop prices on popular routes. This week marks the start of a round of summer sales for many carriers, with one-
way flights being offered for $20.
I took three recent side trips Girona, Spain; Wroclaw, Poland and Olbia in Sardinia, Italy. Visiting these places is a 
very different experience than going to London or Paris. While you typically arrive in capitals armed with 
guidebooks, recommendations from friends and stacks of information from the Internet, not much has yet been 
written about outlying destinations like these. It can be more fun this way you're not weighed down by the obligation 
to cross famous buildings off a master list you've prepared. Here's how I did it:
GIRONA, SPAIN
What Spanish city, not far from the French border, has cutting-edge restaurants, a wonderful Old Town of medieval 
stone buildings, winding alleys and ramparts; and a lively night life spurred by its universities? Barcelona, 
population 1.6 million, isn't the only answer to this question. There's also little Girona, population 90,000, a stone's 
throw from Girona Airport. It's also about 60 miles from Barcelona, so discount airlines pitch Girona as a low-cost 
flight alternative. On Ryanair alone, you can fly to Girona from 36 cities, including London.
Try doing this in Barcelona or any other touristy medieval town in Europe: In Girona, I climbed the stone steps to 
the top of the ancient city wall and walked a good distance, taking in the panoramic views. I was the only person 
there, without even having to buy a ticket for the privilege. Barcelona's famous walking street, La Rambla, has a 
counterpart in Girona, but you're more likely to be sharing Girona's La Rambla paved with cobblestones and 
adjacent to a scenic river with university students, not with tourists.
There's a 15th-century cathedral on top of a steep hill that boasts of the widest nave in the world, and there's an old 
Jewish quarter steeped in history, since Jews were an important contributor to life in Girona until they were expelled 
from the country by the Catholic kings of Spain during the 15th-century Spanish Inquisition.
Girona currently has about 22 hotels, with roughly 1,000 beds total. More hotels are on the way. When I interviewed 
the director of promotion for the city, she bragged that Girona would be getting a new hotel this autumn. A Hilton? A 
Marriott? No, she sheepishly admitted, it will have 10 rooms.
There's a big bonus to Girona, and it's a 30-minute bus or train ride away. The town is Figueres, and the bonus is 
one of the world's best little-known museums, the Dali Museum. Figueres is Dali's home town, and this extensive 
museum captures all the wit and playfulness of the artist. I laughed the entire way through, beginning with the 
fuchsia-colored building with its sculptures of huge eggs on the roof and loaves of bread, and continuing with the 
1940s Cadillac with a white convertible roof in the courtyard that rains on the inside when fed with coins.
Although Barcelona is known for its food, no restaurant there gets more than one star from the Michelin Guide to 
Spain. But Girona has a two-star, El Celler de Can Roca. When I ate lunch here, I had a meal made up of many 
innovative courses with a complex mix of ingredients such as fresh sea urchin roe with seaweed and gelatin.
A restaurant's wine list is usually a source of big profits, but the list here offers something I've hardly ever seen: The 
cheaper, everyday wines sell at a normal markup, maybe three times retail. But the prized wines, including older 
The new way to do Europe: Discount air routes to vibrant but little-known cities
vintages, are priced at about what you'd find at a wine store. Why lose out on what could be hundreds of dollars of 
markup on just one bottle? "That's our policy," says Josep Roca, who runs the dining room. "We want to turn our 
customers on to beautiful wines."
WROCLAW, POLAND
The tourist booklet at my hotel calls Wroclaw a "mini-Prague, only without the scamming taxis, neon strip club signs 
and similar absurdities." For once it isn't hyperbole (although it's an insult to Prague, the Czech capital). Both 
Wroclaw and Prague threw off the Soviet yoke at about the same time. Both are lovely medieval cities with historic 
buildings, an abundance of old churches, cobblestone alleys, and bridges spanning beautiful rivers.
The difference is that Wroclaw is 10 years behind. It doesn't have fancy boutiques and a wide range of bars and 
restaurants yet. "The brand name is still not created," Mayor Rafal Dutkiewicz concedes. "The pronunciation of 
Wroclaw is difficult. Americans are not interested in Poland in general."
This lovely city is a walk through history Czech, Tartar, Russian, German and finally, when the entire German 
population was forcibly expelled after World War II, Polish. Some of the central square, laid out in the 13th century, 
was leveled by bombs in 1945 when the city was still known by the German version of its name Breslau. The 
buildings were so faithfully reconstructed it's impossible to tell the old from the new. My advice is to get there before 
the world learns how to say VROH-slav.
Instead of hordes of tourists, I was able to meet people who actually live there. One day at a food market, for 
instance, I saw local white asparagus, a great delicacy in Europe. I quickly headed for a popular Polish restaurant 
on the town square to see if I could order some. The waiter said they weren't part of Polish cuisine, but gave me 
directions to an Italian restaurant. For a few dollars, I had a big plate of white asparagus that would have cost a 
small fortune in Rome or Paris where I could hardly imagine a waiter directing a potential customer to another 
restaurant.
Wroclaw is so untrendy that it takes a while to adjust to the fact that buildings are renovated to keep them standing, 
not to impress tourists with flashy new designs inside old shells. When I walked into the Art Hotel, where I stayed, I 
was initially so put off by the small, gloomy lobby that I almost walked out to find another. But my room was clean 
and comfortable and the bathroom modern. I realized the renovation had none of the glitz you see in restored 
boutique hotels in more fashionable cities perfectly capturing the spirit of Wroclaw.
Speaking from his elegant office in the Gothic city hall, the mayor and his project director, Igor Chilimonczyk, laid 
out ambitious plans to make Wroclaw a center for upscale, cultural tourism this despite the hordes of budget 
travelers flying in from Britain, some of them far more interested in Polish beer than in museums. "We don't want to 
be another Barcelona," says Mr. Chilimonczyk. That might be wishful thinking: late one night in Wroclaw, I saw 
several groups of British men staggering down the street.
Still, I found myself genuinely thrilled to be, for once, in a medieval city where there's no "must-see" except for the 
cathedral. That meant walking down narrow alleys and into courtyards because they looked intriguing, not because 
my guidebook told me to.
OLBIA, ITALY
The elite who vacation in Porto Cervo on Costa Smeralda (Emerald Coast) are more apt to come in by yacht. But 
on easyJet, about $120 can get you to the nearby town of Olbia, gateway to this stunning stretch of coast in the 
north of Sardinia, Italy.
It's a strange combination budget travelers mixing it up with the likes of European royalty and rock stars like Peter 
Gabriel (who has a house in Porto Cervo). At this glamorous coastal town your lunch bill can exceed your air fare. A 
five-minute drive from my hotel into town cost an outrageous $30 each way by taxi. On top of that, the English-
speaking driver I hired at the airport charged almost $70 an hour.
The new way to do Europe: Discount air routes to vibrant but little-known cities
But if you're willing to forgo staying in the center of things, life needn't be that expensive. My hotel, the Grand Hotel 
of Porto Cervo, spread out on a slope above a rocky beach, offered every amenity, from tennis courts to three 
swimming pools. Even in summer, excepting the peak month of August, a double room can be had for $180 a night.
And meals can be a good value if you know where to go. My driver took me to a local restaurant called Idea Food 
Piccola where, in typical Italian fashion, our lunch took 90 minutes. As I sat on the veranda of an old house, smiling 
waitresses brought out heaping platters of perfectly prepared, straight-from-the-Mediterranean seafood. The cost: 
$20.
The Emerald Coast was developed into a yachting haven in the 1960s by a consortium led by the Aga Khan, and 
the stunning beauty of the area can't be ignored. Buildings had to be low density and adhere to strict architectural 
codes low-rise with red-tile roofs and buff-colored walls. They all blend in rather than compete with the dramatic 
scenery of craggy hills plunging down to dramatic inlets, beaches and bright blue water. Just taking a walk looking 
at the lush green hills carpeted with wildflowers and the wild olive trees was a thrill.
The taxi driver who took me on a three-hour tour of the countryside and villages between Olbia and Porto Cervo 
kept criticizing the Costa Smeralda. "This isn't the real Sardinia," he said. "This is Disneyland. To see the real 
Sardinia, you have to go into the hills." To make his point, he drove me to the house he was building. I could hardly 
believe my eyes. It was set in a field blazing with wildflowers. Half a mile away, was a village on the slopes of a hill, 
topped with a small medieval castle.
This setting backed up his thesis that the focus of the wealthy foreign tourists on the sea was misplaced. Here, just 
half an hour from an area where oceanfront land sells for a small fortune, a taxi driver can afford to buy one of the 
most beautiful plots of land I had ever seen.
Trip Planner
GIRONA, SPAIN
 Getting There: Girona's Airport is a major hub for Ryanair and is served by several other low-cost airlines.
 Where to Stay: AC Palau de Bellavista Hotel is the newest and nicest in town (http://www.activereservations.com); 
rates start at about $175.
 Where to Eat: El Celler de Can Roca, a Michelin two-star restaurant, stands out for the reasonable prices of its 
higher-class wines. Menu prices are the same for both lunch and dinner, with the $105 fixed-price menu 
concentrating on innovative dishes. I found the fixed-price menu's reliance on emulsions (almost all the dishes 
could be eaten with a spoon) off-putting and would recommend choosing a la carte. (http://www.cellercanroca.com).
WROCLAW, POLAND
 Getting There: Ryanair flies to Copernicus Airport Wroclaw from eight European cities, including London. The 
central historic core is compact enough, and the walks beautiful enough, so that the only taxi you'll need to take is 
from airport to hotel.
 Where to Stay: The Art Hotel, in a renovated historic building, is pleasant and comfortable, with a good breakfast 
buffet (http://www.arthotel.pl); rates from about $130. For a modern hotel, try Sofitel Wroclaw (           
http://www.sofitel-wroclaw.com). Rates start at around $200.
 Where to Eat: There are two excellent Polish restaurants right on the main square, called Market Square. Gospoda 
Wroclawska, where I ate pigs' blood baked in an apple, also has delicious shelled crayfish and roast pork (Tel: 48-
71-342-7460). Karczma Lwowska serves the food of Lviv, once part of Poland but now in Ukraine (Tel: 48-71-343-
9887). Both are about $30 a person for three courses and a beer.
OLBIA, SARDINIA
The new way to do Europe: Discount air routes to vibrant but little-known cities
 Getting There: The main low-cost carrier to Olbia Costa Smeralda airport is easyJet, flying from Switzerland, 
London and Berlin. Once there, taxis are so costly it's preferable to rent a car to get to the nearby Costa Smeralda 
(Emerald Coast). The Web site Ciaosardinia.com, sponsored by the Olbia airport authority, has car and hotel 
package deals.
 Where to Stay: I visited several hotels on the Costa Smeralda, but found the Grand Hotel Porto Cervo one of the 
nicest and the best value (http://www.grandhotelinportocervo.com). Rates are from $178 a night but are usually 
higher in August.
 Where to Eat: Idea Food Piccola Ristorazione in Olbia is great for seafood lovers (Tel: 39-340-715-0559). Around 
$20 a person. Orange, the restaurant at the Grand Hotel Porto Cervo, is deservedly popular. About $75 a person.

Airport operator Fraport AG said Monday that the number of passengers using Frankfurt International Airport dipped 
in April because of the early Easter holiday.
The airport said some 4.4 million passengers flew in and out of the airport, the third-busiest in Europe, down 0.3 
percent. The decline came because the Easter holiday was in late March this year.
The company said that traffic at the six airports it operators rose 3 percent to 5.59 million, thanks in part to weekend 
travelers on short holiday breaks.
Its low-cost airport, Frankfurt-Hahn, which is used by Ryanair, posted a 17.2 percent jump in passengers with 
364,646 flying in and out. At Antalya Airport in Turkey, Fraport-owned International Terminal One registered 
260,646 passengers, an increase of 7.2 percent.
Passenger traffic at Lima Airport, in Peru, soared by 22.7 percent to 571,197 passengers while on the Bulgarian 
Black Sea coast, Varna Airport reported a 3.7 percent drop to 27,883 passengers, and Bourgas Airport welcomed 
almost 3,200 passengers.
Cargo activity at Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Hahn, Antalya, Lima, Bourgas and Varna airports together slipped 2.4 percent 
to 199,371 metric tons (219,769 tons).

Highlight: Shares in cider manufacturer C and C soared by more than 3pc today.
Body
Shares in cider manufacturer C and C soared by more than 3pc today after the firm confirmed the sale of its soft 
drinks arm.
The company said this morning that it has entered into agreement to the division, including its Irish distribution 
business, to Britvic for E249.2m. Davy said the price was "well above what was anticipated". 
The sale means that around 93pc of its total revenue will now come from its cider business, with the balance 
accounted for by its international spirits and liqueurs business.
 The news was welcomed by the market. By 1030, shares in C and C were up 38c to 12.36. Those gains were not 
enough to lift the overall market, however, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares plummeting 86.71 points to 9,498.01. 
Bank of Ireland led the fallers, down 25c to 16.15, while other financial shares were mixed. AIB added on 19c to 
22.35, Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 14c to 16.45, while Irish Life and Permanent fell 41c to 19.49 ahead of its AGM 
on Friday. The institution is expected to release a more detailed trading update than usual at the meeting. Davy 
said this is likely because the share price has come under pressure since early March when it became apparent 
that the Irish mortgage market was slowing rapidly. "In the year so far, the stock is down 5pc, making it the second 
worst-performing life stock in Europe," Davy analyst, Scott Rankin, said. "The market feels that the marked 
slowdown in the mortgage market is going to impact earnings momentum. We expect management to acknowledge 
the mortgage market slowdown in their statement but probably make reference to an expect pick-up following the 
general election. We also think they will highlight the offsetting momentum on the life side and consequently 
reiterate guidance." Shares in business support services group DCC were down 1c to 25.31 despite the firm this 
morning posting a near 17pc rise in profits for last year to E161.8m. The rise in profits came on the back of a 17.7pc 
rise in revenue to E4.046bn. The company said that the growth momentum achieved in the first half of the year had 
been maintained in the more significant second half. Elsewhere today, pharmaceutical group Elan was down more 
than 2pc, or 26c, to 10.82, while no frills airline Ryanair fell 1c to 5.58 and fencing and scaffolding group Siteserv 
ISEQ plummets despite 3pc jump in C&C
fell 3c to 0.94. In the construction sector, CRH recovered from last week's modest falls, jumping 48c to 34.25, 
despite reports over the weekend that its Polish materials business has been fined E0.5m for interfering with 
evidence that Polish authorities are gathering on potential price fixing in the cement market. Meanwhile, Grafton 
was down 10c to 11.40, while Kingspan added on 5c to 20.10 and McInerney edged up 10c to 14.30. Investors kept 
faith with the sector, despite the latest Ulster Bank construction industry purchasing managers' index showing that 
growth in the Irish building sector fell to its lowest level in three and a half years during April.

Tourism chiefs face guilt trip on green issues

The tourism industry has never had it so good but its senior executives are feeling strangely guilty about their 
success and fearful of a green backlash.
The industry is expected to expand by 4.3 per cent a year over the next decade and managers are fretting over 
climate change. They worry that flying is seen as the most polluting activity and are falling over themselves to 
champion schemes that allow the travelling public to go on clocking up air miles.
"There is a real conundrum with how we grow in a way we feel good about," said Andrew Cosslett, the chief 
executive of InterContinental Hotels Group. "We need to find ways of making people feel very good about how they 
feel about these things."
Mr Cosslett was in Lisbon at the weekend, along with other hotel, airline and hospitality chief executives attending 
the annual global travel and tourism summit.
Some wanted to rally governments to provide the infrastructure to meet the demand of the emerging middle classes 
of China, India and Mexico, who are readying themselves for global travel.
Others were worried about fuel prices, security, visa problems, technological innovation and the armies of 
hospitality staff needed to cope with demand which, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council, will this 
year generate about Dollars 7bn of economic activity.
But no one could escape the dark shadow of climate change, even though they wished it. "We look at climate 
change as an image issue," said Armin Meier, chief executive of Kuoni Travel, the luxury tour operator.
Maurice Flanagan, vice-chairman of Emirates Airline, was quite happy to share his trenchant view that global 
warming was "an argument".
Tourism chiefs face guilt trip on green issues
He said he was taken aback at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year at the way that airlines were being 
"demonised as the cause of all this".
Mr Flanagan said more worrying than the apparent threat to the planet was the real threat to the existence of low-
cost carriers such as EasyJet and Ryanair.
"If extremists get their way, thousands and thousands of jobs in travel and tourism will be lost."
EasyJet itself was more philosophical. "The debate is over," said Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, its founder. Airlines had 
to replace their fleets with modern fuel-efficient engines, he said, "But the replacement process is slow."
Airlines, hotels and othersectors in the industry will in the next couple of weeks pool resources in a public campaign 
in the UK to demonstrate that they are taking climate change seriously.
They have given up trying to argue the technical niceties of aviation's contribution to carbon emissions. Whether it 
is 2, 3 or 5 per cent, aviation has to do something, they have concluded.
For all the talk, practical meaningful solutions were little in evidence. It fell to James Russell of the Clinton Global 
Initiative to tell the industry what was expected of it.
"Don't be an Exxon," he told the airlines, "Work out what you can do to drive down energy consumption. Travel 
agents should push hotels for carbon disclosure."
He added: "The message to chief executives is that perceptions are changing and you've got between 12 and 24 
months to get on that route."
Exactly how much and for how long is arguable. "It's flavour of the month," said Charles Petruccelli, the president of 
global travel services at American Express. "The problem will realise its way beyond the industry soon."

Sceptics not ready for take-off THE BIG STORY
Sceptics not ready for take-off THE BIG STORY

Body
Extravagant reaction to the recent "open skies" agreement between the EU and the US promised all the usual 
benefits of enhanced competition: more choice, tumbling fares and the launch of new direct routes which would 
save business travellers the tedium of waiting forconnections.
But will it prove to be a false dawn? The deal may look exciting for consumers at first glance but sceptical 
responses from the business travel sector suggest its impact will to be less dramatic and certainly less immediate 
than some commentators predicted.
In the short term, fares may fall at times and on days when demand is lowest.
As more airlines compete on key routes, corporate travel managers may find their hands strengthened when 
negotiating discounts and the range of restricted business class fares - such as those with advance purchase 
requirements - may widen.
But when it comes to the opening of non-stop routes, how many will produce enough traffic to justify investment in 
marketing, aircraft and possibly expensive slots?
The agreement, which takes effect next March, replaces bilateral air treaties between individual EU member 
countries and Washington. As a result any EU-based airline will be able to operate to any airport in the US and any 
US-based carrier will be allowed to fly to any destination in the EU.
The most contentious effect is to open London's Heathrow to more transatlantic flights.
The Bermuda 2 bilateral between London and Washington limited the number of airlines allowed to use the airport 
to two from each side: British Airways and Virgin Atlantic from the UK and American and United Airlines from the 
US.
At least five airlines have said that they plan - or are considering - taking advantage of the agreement: UK carrier 
bmi, which is seeking closer links with its Star Alliance partner United, is determined to fulfil its long-standing desire 
to operate transatlantic flights from Heathrow.
Sceptics not ready for take-off THE BIG STORY
It has promised to unveil details of its first service from the airport soon. Continental, which has asked the US 
Department of Transportation for blanket permission to launch new routes to European cities, wants to start 
services to Heathrow from its Houston hub before summer next year.
Delta is seeking slots to enable it to fly there from New York and Atlanta, starting next spring. Virgin Atlantic is 
conducting a study of six potential routes to New York - from Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan, Amsterdam and Zurich 
- to see if they would sustain a challenge on incumbent carriers. A spokesman says: "It would be a substantial 
investment. We'd need to lease planes. But it is a real possibility."
And low-cost Ryanair has signalled its intention to set up aseparate long-haul carrier which would fly from its 
European bases to secondary US airports.
In support of open skies, bmi compared published, non-discounted, unrestricted business class fares from London 
on BA and Virgin to various US destinations with those from Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Stockholm.
All the fares from the French, Dutch and Swedish airports were more than 40 per cent cheaper. Some of those from 
Frankfurt were more than 50 per cent lower and one from Stockholm - to Chicago - was 60.17 per cent less.
Nigel Turner, bmi's chief executive, says it was "scandalous" that under Bermuda 2, travellers from London had 
been forced to pay so much more.
Will the new agreement end this disparity?
Probably not, thinks the UK Civil Aviation Authority. It has estimated that overall, the agreement could bring down 
transatlantic prices by an average of 10 per cent in real terms over five years.
Optimists may point to the impact of recent liberalisation on routes between the UK and India. Before deregulation, 
demand for non-stop flights clearly outstripped supply.
The loosening of constraints on competition in 2004 and 2005 has prompted a huge increase in flights and a wider 
range of reduced fares for travellers prepared to accept less flexibility.
Mike Platt, group industry affairs director of UK-based travel management company HRG, says: "The situation on 
US routes is not as extreme as it was to India but flights are very, very busy. Some people are not getting the flights 
they want. I think in the longer term we will see airlines merging to take advantage of slots. In the short term we 
won't see any sudden fare reductions. There might be some off-peak deals but on peak departures any extra 
capacity will just go to meet unsatisfied demand."
Similar scepticism is expressed by Andrew Waller, executive vice-president in the UK for Carlson Wagonlit Travel.
"I doubt an open skies agreement initially will bring much significant change to the majority of business travellers," 
he says.
"Competition is already intense on key routes from key airports. Short term, there may be more choice as additional 
airlines such as bmi come on to routes. However we don't anticipate seeing any significant shifts in market share 
and we certainly don't see any dramatic change in Heathrow prices for business class. The most obvious impact is 
likely to be in the form of potential airline mergers and acquisitions and the subsequent effect of these will take 
some time to filter through."
Philip Carlisle, chief executive of the UK's Guild of Travel Management Companies, says competition that forced 
down business class fares from Heathrow would be welcome.
But he acknowledges that a major obstacle may be a shortage of suitable slots, which change hands for huge 
amounts of money on the so-called "grey market".
Sceptics not ready for take-off THE BIG STORY
With that proviso, fares might drop if one or more of the business class-only carriers operating to the US from 
London were to startservices from the airport. None of those airlines - Eos, Maxjet, which fly from Stansted and 
Silverjet, which operates from Luton - has expressed any burning interest in the idea. However Eos says it is "glad 
the option exists".
Peter Sijbers, global commodity manager for Philips, based at Eindhoven in the Netherlands, says: "So-called open 
skies is exactly the way to describe it. In theory it could foster competition, particularly in the high yield business and 
first-class cabins. But if some other associated issues are not resolved - slot allocation and capacity at certain key 
European airports such as Frankfurt, Paris and particularly London - the outcome will be zero.
"I don't see anything in the agreement which facilitates the more liberal allocation of slots. And I don't see any other 
airports in Europe with enough traffic to attract new flights to and from the US. It would be great to be able to fly to 
more gateways in the US but I don't think I'm being unduly cynical when I say 'wait and see'.
"Potentially it could open doors but for now it's not even half a solution."

Ryanair is reported to have offered to sell Aer Lingus landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport in order to get 
approval from the European Commission for its proposed takeover of the airline. 
A report on the Reuters news agency quoted sources saying that Ryanair was willing to sell slots at Dublin and 
Heathrow to British Airways and CityJet
The Commission extended its inquiry into Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus until July 4. 
 The original deadline was May 11. It was then extended to June 13 Ryanair withdrew its E1.48bn hostile takeover 
bid in December last year after the commission launched the in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' 
over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines. Ryanair built up a 25.2pc stake in Aer Lingus before 
launching its bid. The deal has faced oppositions from other shareholders - including the Irish government - and 
unions. Last week, its chief executive Michael O' Leary said the airline will appeal if the EU opposes its hostile 
takeover bid for Aer Lingus when it concludes its inquiry in July.

Remember there is seldom such a thing as a free lunch. So how does a lowcost airline make money when you pay 
just for the tax when you fly?
 Not everyone on a flight is paying the same fare. While you may have booked a discounted fare and possibly paid 
just the tax and no "fare" at all, others have booked late and much more expensively. The game is filling otherwise 
empty seats and making the money elsewhere through other charges and "ancillary" earnings, most importantly 
commission on bookings of hotels, hire cars and travel insurance. Here is how Ryanair and EasyJet compare: 
Ryanair extra charges Paying by credit card - Visa Pounds 2.50 each way Travel insurance - from Pounds 6.50 
Baggage - various charges (inc Pounds 5 for each piece of luggage checkedin) Inflight sales Cup of coffee -

undisclosed): Hotel reservations, car hires, travel insurance EasyJet extra charges Paying by credit card - Pounds 
4.95 per booking, plus 1.95 per cent of bill Travel insurance - varies depending on length Baggage - various

Even the airlines themselves are not quite sure what is going on in the European travel market.
There are almost as many reasons being offered for the weaker conditions reported in the past week as there are 
carriers. But they seem to be agreed on one thing: it suddenly became harder to fill their seats in April.
While it is too early to make a trend out of one month's data, some are concerned that airline stocks may have 
peaked after a bull run that has lasted almost two-and-a-half years, and have taken some profits.
EasyJet, the leading UK low-cost carrier, has been warning since February that it expected pressure on its yields or 
average fares in the summer because of tough competition, as well as suffering from the effects of comparison with 
a strong summer last year.
Investors may have been waiting for a trend to form, but they suddenly took fright this week when the airline 
reported that it had only filled 83.1 per cent of its seats in April compared with 86.4 per cent in the same month a 
year ago.
Passenger volumes still rose by 10 per cent year-on-year, but that failed to keep pace with the airline's increase in 
capacity.
Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, theorised that the weakness in demand could be due to several factors, 
ranging from the recent doubling of air passenger duty in the UK, from Pounds 5 to Pounds 10 each, to the slightly 
earlier timing of Easter this year, which meant the school holidays started in March rather than in April.
He suggested, too, that highly vocal lobbying by environmental groups about the impact of aviation on climate 
change might have affected travel choices.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of rival Ryanair, dismissed such a suggestion as "a load of nonsense . . . there is 
no sign of the loonies discouraging people from flying".
Riddle of soft European travel market spawns many theories
He added: "There is no evidence of people travelling less.Actually they are travelling more. And I don't see fewer 
kiwi fruits and kumquats (dependent on air cargo) being sold in Sainsbury's either."
He preferred to attribute the weakness tohigher air passenger duty and airport charges and nervousness about 
rising interest rates.
Air Berlin, the German low-cost carrier, also reported lower loads in April. It filled 74.9 per cent of its seats, down 
from77.8 per cent a year ago.
It blamed the weather. It said the prolonged spell of unseasonably warm weather in northern Europe last month 
contrasted with prolonged periods of rain in Mediterranean countries. This affected the normally high level of short-
term April bookings away from Germany.
Coming on top of the news from airlines were surprise figures from BAA, which operates seven airports in the UK 
including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, the biggest airport in Europe for low-cost carriers.
Passenger numbers in April at its seven UK airports fell 1.6 per cent year-on-year, including a2.2 per cent fall at its 
three London airports.
Only two weeks ago BAA issued a forecast for a rise of 2.4 per cent at the London airports for the 12 months to the 
end of March 2008.
BAA suggested the fall last month reflected "some economic uncertainty" over higher interest rates, higher inflation 
and airfare increases.
Last week British Airways warned that it was facing "weak" demand in the non-premium segment of the market, 
"especially on the Atlantic", and BAA reported that its North Atlantic traffic had dipped by 2.1 per cent, possibly a 
sign that US travellers are being put off travelling to Europe by the weakness of the dollar.
There have been warnings, too, from carriers in the US about changes in the domestic market. Several US airline 
executives have reported creeping overcapacity, seen as a threat to the industry's fragile recovery from five years 
of losses.
Gary Kelly, chief executive of Southwest Airlines, the leading US low-cost carrier, said the current environment was 
reminiscent of 2001, when a slowing economy started to erode carriers' pricing power.
In Europe, Ryanair and EasyJet are not waiting for one month to become a trend and have piled into the market 
with discounted fares and promotions.
Cut-price seat sales are common practice at Ryanair, but they are unusual on this scale in the peak summer 
months.

Iberia airlines said Friday it swung to a net profit in the first three months of the year, helped by rising revenue and 
cost cuts.
Spain's largest airline by sales, currently the object of a preliminary €3.41 billion (US$4.61 billion) bid from private 
equity firm TPG, posted first-quarter net profit of €12.2 million (US$16.5 million), compared to a loss of €45 million a 
year earlier. Revenue rose 8.5 percent to €1.31 billion (US$1.77 billion).
Operating costs widened 2.4 percent in the first quarter to €1.30 billion (US$1.76 billion).
Iberia said that unit costs, based on available seats per kilometer, dropped 0.6 percent.
Iberia is currently reducing domestic flights and focusing on long-haul routes and the introduction of a new business 
service to capture a larger slice of these lucrative market segments. The company has also implemented drastic 
measures to lower labor and operational costs in recent months.
Iberia's profitability has been under intense pressure from low-fare airlines easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC 
after both companies increased operations in Spain in recent months.
Fuel costs, which represent more than 20 percent of total operating costs, on unit cost terms dropped 1.4 percent 
due to improvements on fuel consumption efficiency from its fleet renewal.
Total fuel costs jumped more than 45 percent in the first quarter of 2006 to €257.6 million (US$348.46 million), amid 
global volatility on crude oil prices.
Iberia said it has hedged 50 percent of its fuel consumption for 2007 at a median price of US$61.50 (€45.46) a 
barrel.
Operating profit, which excludes one-off items, stood at €13.1 million (US$17.72 million), compared with a net loss 
of €63.5 million a year earlier.

Iberia's shares have gained more than 38 percent so far this year, bolstered by takeover speculation. As well as 
TPG, rival private equity company Apax Partners is attempting to put together a consortium to bid Iberia, although it 
has not yet disclosed an offer.
Iberia shares were up 1.3 percent to €3.82 (US$5.17), above TPG's nonbinding bid of €3.60 (US$4.87) per share.

The Dublin market managed to drag itself out of the red as investors sought out bargains.
ISEQ up 72.75 points to 9,584.72.
The four days of trading saw a string of mostly positive corporate quarterly, full year and six months results, trading 
updates and AGM statements that nevertheless failed to excite buying as Irish investors fretted over domestic and 
global economics.
 Decisions from central banks in the UK, UK and from the ECB worried about the effects of rising global inflation 
and some volatile trading on Wall Street helped to put the brakes on the previous week's share index rise. The 300-
plus points lost from the ISEQ during the week was also the result of a 'correction' in what analysts say was some 
over zealous buying of key blue chips, most notably CRH but also C and C and Kingspan. Yesterday, Grafton 
delivered an up-beat assessment of trading to its AGM for the first four months of this year, saying that its UK 
merchanting division continued the trend of last year thanks to a strong UK economy and a still buoyant housing 
market. At home, the group said it noted a moderation in demand in the residential construction market and 
increased activity in the residential RMI market in a very favourable economic environment. Grafton shares gained 
122c to E11.50. Elsewhere in the sector, CRH continued its decline with the stock down 13c to E33.77, Kingspan 
dropped 25c to E20.05 and McInerney declined by 5c to E14.18. Meanwhile, Blackrock International Land has 
entered into a 50:50 joint venture to acquire a newly constructed high specification office building in Brussels for a 
total outlay of E47.1m. Shares in the property firm edged up 1c to E0.50. Shares in no-frills airline, Ryanair, were 
among the best performing stocks, up 9c to E5.59. It colourful chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said that he 
expects to double its number of passengers to 100m in five years time. Ryanair also pointed out it expects to 
double its number of bases from 20 to about 40. Ryanair launched a price war on Wednesday against its rivals, 
selling 10m seats for between £10 and £20 in its largest ever promotion. The main banks put in a mixed 
performance with AIB shares down 9c to E22.16 while Bank of Ireland managed to climb 45c to E15.40, Anglo Irish

jumped 10c to E16.35 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 60c to E19.90. Anglo Irish shares were badly hit on 
Thursday as its interim results showed another period of record profits but disappointed on its pipeline loans. The 
stock rebounded yesterday after Goodbodys analyst, Robert Eason, upgraded its earnings per share forecast by 
2pc to 3pc. 'We are now forecasting 07 earnings per share of 124.7 cent (a 33pc year on year gain) and full year 08 
earnings of 152.7 cent (a 22pc rise),' he said. Elsewhere, reports suggest that Independent News and Media may 
be running the rule over the Racing Post, the daily title put up for sale by Trinity Mirror. INM is understood to be on 
the prowl for acquisitions, buoyed by the expected inflow of E350-375m over the summer, following a successful 
completion of the APN take-private deal. Indo shares rose 18c to E3.80.

Companies should attribute as much importance to declaring their impact on the environment as they should to 
their financial statements, the minister for climate change said yesterday.
Ian Pearson urged all large businesses to sign up urgently to a common standard for reporting greenhouse gas 
emissions, known as the Carbon Disclosure Project.
The level of carbon dioxide emissions would become as significant as trading statements or the balance sheet 
because investors increasingly wanted more reliable information about a company's carbon "footprint", he said at a 
meeting with business representatives in New York.
"Proper financial reporting is a no-brainer. Carbon reporting must be the same."
However, Mr Pearson warned executives they could not expect to use carbon reporting simply as a way of 
burnishing their environmental credentials.
"This is not a box-ticking exercise. 'Green wash' is of no use to institutional investors when making financial 
decisions," he said.
Mr Pearson's suggestion that businesses should worry about climate change as much as their profits is likely to 
raise eyebrows in boardrooms.
The minister rose to fame early this year with an outspoken attack on Ryanair's scepticism about aviation's 
contribution to global warming, labelling the low-cost airline the "unacceptable face of capitalism".
The Carbon Disclosure Project works on behalf of global institutional investors with assets worth Dollars 41,000bn 
(Pounds 20,600bn) providing a mechanism for business to measure and declare its carbon emissions.
Only 55 per cent of the FTSE 100 provided quantified emissions data, fewer than half of them to the required 
standard.

Investors did not trust EasyJet when it denied it would follow rival Ryanair and issue a profit warning in 2004. They 
were vindicated when a profit warning ensued. No wonder investors are taking the low-cost airline's latest 
reassurances about its business with a pinch of salt.
Downbeat comments from many of Europe's low-cost carriers has savaged share prices across the sector in the 
past week. EasyJet has been badly hit. Its stock has fallen 17 per cent. Much of the decline happened yesterday, 
when it said current trading was a little softer than envisaged.
Yet EasyJet has stressed that it still expects to lift pre-tax profits by at least 40 per cent this year - a target in place 
since November.
When a company's shares fall this rapidly, the market is signalling that it expects a full-blown profit warning before 
long. That is forgivable given EasyJet's history. Investors saw 25 per cent wiped off the company's market value 
three years ago when it eventually admitted it was experiencing similar challenges to Ryanair. EasyJet has been 
under new management since December 2005, but the team seems to have inherited the old credibility problem.
The reality is that the airline industry is cyclical and a downturn is probably due about now, according to research by 
JPMorgan. EasyJet flagged six months ago that it would encounter headwinds later in 2007. And it always faced 
demanding comparisons against the impressive performance it turned in last year. Up to now, investors have 
ignored these signs that the business might slow, preferring to buy the shares on momentum.
The penny has now dropped that conditions are deteriorating and it is echoing loudly round the stock market. 
Whether or not EasyJet ends up issuing the rumoured profit warning, an avalanche of good news from the sector 
looks unlikely this year. Against that backdrop, it is hard to see the sector's upward momentum of the past two 
years continuing. If momentum is not travelling upwards, that probably means it will go the other way.

Ryanair yesterday launched its "latest price war across Europe", offering up to 3.5m seats at Pounds 10 one-way 
including tax in a drive to fill its seats in the face of a softer market.
The price battle has already been joined by EasyJet, where Andy Harrison, chief executive of Ryanair's closest low-
cost rival, said yesterday the group had reduced many of its lead-in fares and increased promotional activity in 
order to "sustain high load factors in weaker market conditions".
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the third largest short-haul carrier in Europe after Air France-KLM and 
the Lufthansa group - admitted the offensive would depress airline yields and air fares across Europe.
Ryanair mounts regular discounted fare promotions, but Mr O'Leary said this would be its biggest seat sale, with 
10m seats on offer for the next four months at one-way prices from Pounds 10 to Pounds 20 including taxes. About 
3.5m seats, or 16 per cent of capacity, would be available for Pounds 10 including taxes. "People will just be flying 
for Gordon Brown's air passenger duty," he said.
APD on short-haul economy fares in the UK was doubled to Pounds 10 per departing passenger in February. 
Ryanair is also falling into line with a recent instruction from the Office of Fair Trading to quote fares inclusive of 
taxes and charges.
The EasyJet share price dropped sharply for the second successive day yesterday in response to the reports 
byseveral airlines of a softermarket, declining by 5.3 per cent, or 33 1/2p, to close at 598p. The price fell by 7.1 per 
cent on Tuesday and has fallen by 18 per cent in three weeks from the all-time high of 732p.
EasyJet has been one of the biggest casualties among airline stocks, but the Ryanair share price has fallen by 14 
per cent in the past two-and-a-half weeks.
The two carriers have warned that yields, or average fares, were expected to continue to fall during the summer 
months in the face of tough competition.

Low-cost airline easyJet reported a narrower first-half loss on Wednesday, but its shares fell after it added that its 
passenger numbers were being hit by higher taxes, rising interest rates and environmental concerns.
EasyJet said its first-half net loss narrowed to 12.7 million pounds (€18.6 million; US$25.3 million), less than half the 
28.9 million pound loss for the same period a year ago.
Revenue rose 14 percent to 719 million pounds (€1.055 billion US1.4 billion), while passenger numbers rose 11 
percent, the company said.
"We continue to see pressure on yields in the summer against high comparatives from last year and due to 
continued competition," said Chief Executive Andy Harrison.
"Maybe a little is due to air passenger duty, maybe people are feeling the increase in interest rates, maybe at the 
margins some people are not flying due to the environmental debate," he said.
The British government doubled the air passenger duty in February in a bid to tackle climate change.
EasyJet and fellow budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC have both reported a negative impact on yields from the 
new tax. EasyJet on Tuesday released passenger statistics for April showing passenger growth of 10 percent, but a 
3.3 percent fall in its load factor.
The passenger statistics have troubled analysts, who say they throw doubt over easyJet's forecast of a 40 percent 
to 50 percent increase in full-year profits.
The carrier's shares fell 4.6 percent to 602.5 pence (US$11.99; €8.84) on the London Stock Exchange.
Andrew Fitchie, an analyst at Collins Stewart, said that Wednesday's announcement made it clear that necessary 
updates to easyJet's fleet were not on the "short-term horizon."
"The stock is likely to be dead money until the short-term outlook clarifies," he added.

Ryanair, Europe's fastest-growing airline that pioneered the practice of offering "free flights plus tax," announced 
Wednesday it has begun selling all of its tickets with required taxes and fees included in the advertised price.
The change followed European Union regulators' complaints about deceptive trading practices. They singled out 
Ryanair, although many of the airlines' competitors, including its domestic rival Aer Lingus, had followed suit with 
similar policies.
The new Ryanair policy means that the Web site's front-page price quotes now include required government 
charges. But they do not include possible additional charges, such as Ryanair's fees for using credit or debit cards, 
checking luggage or advance check-in.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary revealed the decision as he announced what he called a "price war" with other 
airlines. He noted Ryanair was hoping to reverse its recent decline in the percentage of sold seats per flight, known 
in the industry as "load factor."
Ryanair shares slid last week after the company said its average passenger load had fallen by 2 points to 82 
percent in the first quarter of 2007. This meant an average of 18 out of every 100 available tickets went unsold.
To woo business, O'Leary said Ryanair would offer customers who could find a cheaper identical flight on another 
airline a refund equal to double the difference. The offer runs through June 12.
"Ryanair already delivers Europe's best punctuality, the fewest lost bags and a no-fuel-surcharge guarantee. Now, 
we guarantee that Ryanair won't be beaten on fares either," O'Leary said.
O'Leary's price blitz also involves 10 million seats starting at 10 pounds ($20) for its British-based customers and 
prices starting at 10 euros ($13.50) elsewhere in Europe. The offer, for flights throughout the summer, runs for as 
long as supplies last.
Ryanair spokeswoman Lorna Farren said the lowest price available on some of those routes could be higher, 
perhaps double the headline figure.

Ryanair's offers on its British Web site Wednesday indicated the promotion's best deal ranged from 10 pounds up to

Ryanair shares closed unchanged at 5.42 euros ($7.33) amid broadly negative trading on the Irish Stock Exchange.

Ryanair, Europe's fastest-growing airline that pioneered the practice of offering "free flights plus tax," announced 
Wednesday it has begun selling all of its tickets with required taxes and fees included in the advertised price.
The move followed European Union regulators' complaints about deceptive trading practices. They had singled out 
Ryanair, although many of the airlines' competitors, including its Irish domestic rival Aer Lingus, have followed suit 
with similar policies.
The new Ryanair policy means that the Web site's front-page price quotes now include required government 
charges. But they do not include potentially optional charges, such as Ryanair's fees for using credit or debit cards, 
checking luggage or advance check-in.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary revealed the move as he announced what he called a "price war" with other 
airlines. He noted Ryanair was hoping to reverse its recent decline in the percentage of sold seats per flight, known 
in the industry as "load factor."
Ryanair shares slid last week after the airline surprised analysts by saying its average passenger "load" had fallen 
by 2 points to 82 percent in the first quarter of 2007. This meant an average of 18 out of every 100 available tickets 
went unsold.
To woo business, O'Leary said Ryanair would offer customers who could find a cheaper identical flight on another 
airline a refund equal to double the difference. The offer runs through June 12.
"Ryanair already delivers Europe's best punctuality, the fewest lost bags and a no-fuel-surcharge guarantee. Now, 
we guarantee that Ryanair won't be beaten on fares either," O'Leary said.
O'Leary's price blitz also involves 10 million seats "from" 10 pounds (€15, US$20) for its British-based customers 
and "from" €10 (US$13.50) elsewhere in Europe. The offer, for flights throughout the summer, runs for as long as 
supplies last.

Highlight: Ryanair will appeal if the EU opposes its takeover bid for Aer Lingus
Body
Ryanair will appeal if the EU opposes its hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus when it concludes its inquiry in July, 
chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
'The EU will rule in the interests of the Irish government rather than the consumer,' he said. 'We hope they will 
approve (the deal) but we suspect they won't, in which case we will immediately appeal to the European Court.'
A verdict against Ryanair's lapsed bid would be 'purely political', in light of the approval of Air France's tie-up with 
KLM and Flybe's recent takeover of BA Connect, O'Leary said at a press conference in London. Aer Lingus today 
announced it is increasing its fuel surcharges to E100 from E70 for a return trip across the Atlantic. Ryanair had 
promised to scrap these charges in its offer document submitted to the EU, he added. O'Leary's comments came 
as the airline launched a price promotion, with 10 million seats across Europe on sale for prices from £10 each 
including taxes, in response to the recent softening in passenger yields. 'We're launching our latest price war across 
Europe,' O'Leary said. The market 'over-reacted' to the softening of yields and the recent two percentage point 
decline in the airline's load factor to 83 pct in April, he said. 'We are still growing capacity and responding 
aggressively with lower fares and price promotions,' he said. The low-cost airline is also quoting prices inclusive of 
tax on its website for the first time, and says it will pay double the difference in fares if passengers find a cheaper 
fare on the same route with any other airline.

The EasyJet share price fell sharply yesterday as investors reacted with concern to the airline's repeated warning 
that it was still seeing pressure on fare levels in the summer months due to continued competition.
The share price fell by 48 1/2p or 7.1 per cent to close at 631 1/2p, even though the leading UK low-cost carrier left 
its profit guidance for the current financial yearto the end of September unchanged.
However, Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive,said that the airline's revenues per seat had fallen in April from 
the high level of a year ago.
EasyJet reported thatit had only filled 83.1 per cent of its seats in April, down from 86.4 per cent a year ago.
Passenger numbers in April were 10 per cent higher year-on-year, but EasyJet is still addinga signficant amountof 
capacity and has beentaking delivery of a new 156-seat A319 jet fromAirbus on average every12 days.
Overall capacity is growing by about 15 per cent in the current financial year.
Mr Harrison said that EasyJet, which reports its first-half results today, still expected pre-tax profits to grow in the 
full year to September by 40-50 per cent from the Pounds 129.1m achieved last year.
For investors with long memories there mighthave been a disturbing similarity in yesterday's announcement to 
events three years ago, when EasyJet, then under a different management team, sought to reassure nervous 
investors about its own performance in the wake of warnings by Ryanair of problems it was facing.
Within two months EasyJet had issued two profit warnings.
Yesterday's share price decline has also come from a very high level.
The share price more than doubled in 12 months from 309 1/2p in late April last year to an all-time peak of 732p 
three weeks ago, but has since fallen by 13.7 per cent from the peak.

Investor concerns grew yesterday that airlines could be reaching the top of the trading cycle, as EasyJet and Air 
Berlin, the UK and German low-cost carriers, both warned yesterday that they had faced greater difficulty in April 
filling seats.
EasyJet said that its load factor, the share of seats filled, had fallen by 3.3 percentage points from 86.4 to 83.1 per 
cent, while Air Berlin reported that its load factor had fallen from 77.8 per cent to 74.9 per cent.
The German carrier blamed the fall on the weather and the prolonged spell of unseasonably warm weather in 
northern Europe last month, which had contrasted with prolonged periods of rain in the Mediterranean countries. 
This had weakened the normally high level of short-term April bookings from Germany to the sun.
The share prices of both airlines fell, however, as yesterday's announcements appeared to confirm statements last 
week from both Ryanair and British Airways about a growing softness in leisure markets.
Airline yields or average fares have been in overall decline for decades, although the fall has traditionally been 
reversed temporarily in the strongest years of the trading cycle. By the end of March the yield trend for the three 
leading European network carriers had been positive for two years, prompting some aviation analysts to warn of 
leaner times ahead.
Airline share prices have enjoyed a strong run inthe past year, but Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JPMorgan, told 
investors in January "to think very hard" about how much longer they wanted to hold the shares of highly cyclical 
network airlines. "Negative yield trends will reassert themselves, probably this year," he said.
The Ryanair share price has fallen sharply since the Irish carrier issued a surprise warning last Thursday that tax 
rises in the UK and higher airport charges were hitting its yields and were undermining its ability to fill its seats.
The Ryanair share price, which reached an all-time high of Euros 6.33 three weeks ago, fell further yesterday to 
close 15 cents or 2.7 per cent lower at Euros 5.42.
Fears for air industry grow as carriers fail to fill seats
British Airways also warned last week, that it was facing "weak" demand in the non-premium segment of the market 
"especially on the Atlantic" although premium traffic, where the airline generates most of its profits remained 
"positive".

* Standard Life is expected to announce solid results on the back of strong life assurance and pension sales when it 
reveals its figures for the first quarter.
The consensus of 11 analysts' forecasts is that worldwide insurance sales will jump 31 per centfrom the year-
agoquarter to Pounds 3,664m, while sales of its UK life and pension products will rise 36 per cent to Pounds 
2,889m.
Last week, Cazenove placed an outperform rating on the business. Cazenove now values the shares at 370p, but 
predicts they could rise to 412p "on a blue-sky" view and possibly higher if the group became the object of a 
takeover. "Recent meetings with management suggest that strong operational momentumwill continue, both attop 
and bottom lines," Cazenove said.
Standard Life shares fell 2p to close at 334.75p on Friday.
WEDNESDAY
* EasyJet's half-year results will be closely watched by shareholders and analysts concerned about the effect of tax 
rises in the UK and higher airport charges on the number of people choosing to use the budget airline.
Analysts are expecting the company to report a45 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits on the back of significant 
capacity growth. Earnings per share are expected to increase by 6 per cent.
Andrew Fitchie, an analyst at Collins Stewart, said in a recent note: "Upgrades are necessary to sustain the shares 
at current levels."
Concern was raised last week when Ryanair, EasyJet's Irish rival, revealed a decline in the proportion of seats it 
filled on its planes from 85 to 83 per cent, which it blamed on the doubling of air passenger duty and other charges. 
As such, there is thought to be a chance easyJet could fail to impress because of the imposition of these costs.* 
Sage, the accounting software business, is expected to make a respectable showing with its first-half results.
Companies Diary
Analysts' consensus forecast for pre-tax profits is Pounds 122m (Pounds 113.7m) and revenues are expected tobe 
Pounds 586m (Pounds 455.9m).
Growth is expected tobe driven by recent acquisitions and organic growth in the businessand healthcare software 
market.
Analysts are expected to seek an update on the integration of Sage's Emdeon acquisition, which forms the core of 
its healthcare business.
Mark Bryan, analyst at Deutsche Bank, says Sage's last update on April12 suggests that the numbers will be in line 
with expectations.
THURSDAY
* 3i is expected to report full-year results that will benefit from a bumper period for asset realisations from the sale, 
flotation or refinancing of portfolio companies.
Morgan Stanley has lifted its net asset value forecast by 7 per cent to 900p a share to reflect the strong market for 
disposals. "Near term realisation environment supports momentum," Morgan Stanley said, adding that it also took a 
positive view on opportunities for 3i to expand geographically, especially in Asia, and to raise income generated 
from managing third-party funds.
However, potential challenges include "portfolio seasoning", and competition for mid-market size deals and 
infrastructure assets.
Meanwhile, Dresdner Kleinwort, which estimates NAV at the top of analysts' forecast range at 915p, says the full-
year could represent a "cyclical high" with realised gains of Pounds 780m.
But it also forecasts investment for the year up 36 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn, a number flattered by 3i's investment 
in utility AWG, noting that fresh capital commitments are the "growth engine for the future".

Brothers' fast-track to success is being hot in the pursuit of words
Brothers' fast-track to success is being hot in the pursuit of words

Andy and Mike Mindel's introduction to entrepreneurship was the corporate equivalent of being given the keys to 
their father's car and driving into a motorway pile-up.
The brothers had only recently graduated when they were put in charge of Arrowfile, a photograph storage business 
in which Maurice Mindel, their dad, had invested most of his working life.
This was a decade ago when dotcoms were all the rage. Internet picture sharing sites rapidly made Arrowfile's 
business model redundant and sales plummeted.
Andy and Mike managed to sell the company but the trauma of ditching their dad's business clearly still leaves 
some scars.
"We know what it is like to have to sell a business, we just don't want to go through that again," says Andy, who as 
a child spent every weekend working for his dad.
"The business was actually dying for some time. It needed a lot of investment. Mike and I had to make a choice."
The experience has shaped the brothers' much more positive experience in creating what is a world-beating 
internet business from their north London home.
Wordtracker, their company, made a profit of Pounds 492,000 on a Pounds 1.3m turnover last year.
It pinpoints the best words to use to attract people to a website by developing complex software tools that can 
analyse the most popular phrases keyed into internet search engines.
For example, people looking for a budget airline might tend to enter the words "cheap flights" in a Google search, 
making this phrase a much better bet than, say, "low-cost fares" to get people to go to Ryanair's website.
In spite of the fate of Arrowfile, the Mindelbrothers' father has been a solid support for his sons, providing the 
Pounds 20,000 they needed to get the business off the ground in return for a third share of the company.
Brothers' fast-track to success is being hot in the pursuit of words
"He has inspired the entrepreneurial spirit in us," says Andy, who has taken the chief executive's role in the new 
company while his elder brother focuses on the technology. "He has made us believe that we could do it."
The idea for Wordtracker came to the brothers while they were still running Arrowfile and were trying to attract 
people to their corporate website.
Their good fortune was to be seen as the first to market in the US after speaking to some key people in the 
American technology industry.
"When we go out to the States, we are treated like rock stars," Mike says, noting that at American trade shows they 
are pestered for autographs and mobbed by the business press, while back in London they remain relatively 
unknown.
The US now accounts for about 85 per cent of their sales and a Google search on Wordtracker throws up more 
than half a million mentions of the business.
Given the adulation that the men receive on the other side of the Atlantic it is perhaps a surprise that they choose to 
remain in the UK and not up sticks to Silicon Valley.
"We like being back in London because it keeps us real," Mike says. "We work with people who tell you when you 
are being a twat. It is much better than playing the fame game."
They also have "the best pub in the world" around the corner from their Kentish Town office.
Given the growth of search companies such as Google, it is also surprising that the Mindel brothers have not turned 
Wordtracker into a much larger company during the nine years it has been trading.
"We didn't want to get too big and impersonal," Mike says. "One of the things we enjoy is our Wordtracker culture. 
People thrive here. They don't feel like a cog in a machine."
Working at Wordtracker certainly has its perks, not least a company policy that ensures none of the 15 employees 
needs to work longer than a four-day week. Several of them use the time to run their own consultancy businesses, 
the brothers admit.
"We encourage people to have their own outside interests because we often benefit from that," Mike says, noting 
that it was during one of these days off recently that a senior programmer hit upon a new data mining technique that 
helped Wordtracker become "700 per cent" more productive at spotting search trends.
The brothers are planning a significant expansion of Wordtracker over the next few years by starting to mine the 
data gathered on web users' behaviour by internet service providers (ISPs).
Unlike the data they have been using, which just shows what searches took place, the ISP information shows what 
websites people go to after doing a search.
The new opportunities created by this kind of information should enable Wordtracker to increase turnover from 
about Pounds 2m this year to Pounds 20m in 2011 and double its work force to 30 people.
However, the brothers still seem reluctant to make Wordtracker too big.
"Making a mistake is not a travesty when you are this size, making a high profit margin is," Mike says.

The European Commission on Friday extended until July 4 its deadline to rule on Ryanair Holdings PLC's €1.48 
billion (US$1.9 billion) hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus PLC.
It said it needed another 15 days to examine an offer likely put forward by Ryanair to make changes to the deal in 
the hopes of winning regulatory approval. These commitments usually involve selling off units or changing the way 
a company does business to eliminate antitrust concerns.
Regulators launched their in-depth probe in December, saying they saw "serious competition concerns" with the 
proposed combination of Ireland's two major airlines because it could reduce customer choice and raise fares.
Europe's largest no-frills airline had withdrawn the takeover offer in December when the EU's executive arm 
launched its investigation, but said Feb. 5 it hoped to renew its bid when the EU probe wraps up.
Ryanair's bid already looked troubled before that when it sought to build on its 25 percent stake. Investors opposed 
to a buyout control more than 46 percent of shares.
The Irish government, which owns a quarter of the country's national carrier, is fiercely opposed and fewer than 1 
percent of Aer Lingus shareholders had accepted the Ryanair offer.

The European Commission on Friday extended until July 4 its deadline to rule on Ryanair Holdings PLC's 1.48 
billion euros ($1.9 billion) hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus PLC.
It said it needed another 15 days to examine an offer likely put forward by Ryanair to make changes to the deal in 
the hopes of winning regulatory approval. These commitments usually involve selling off units or changing the way 
a company does business to eliminate antitrust concerns.
Regulators began investigating in December, saying they saw "serious competition concerns" with the proposed 
combination of Ireland's two major airlines because it could reduce customer choice and raise fares.

The Nasdaq 100 rose slightly Friday, after media reports saying Microsoft Corp. wants to buy Yahoo Inc. sent 
shares of the search-engine operator climbing.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 
5.6 points to 1,901.24. The broader Nasdaq composite advanced 8.74 points to 2,574.20.
Yahoo gained $5.20, or 18.5 percent, to $33.38. Analysts said a deal between the two companies would better

Ryanair shares fell more than 5 per cent yesterday as Europe's leading low-cost airline issued a surprise warning 
that tax rises in the UK and higher airport charges were hitting its yields and undermining its ability to fill its seats.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said "softer market conditions" could continue throughout the vital summer traffic 
months from April to September.
The shares fell 32 cents to Euros 5.80. Ryanair, which was floated in 1997, reached an all-time high of Euros 6.33 
two weeks ago.
The statement contributed to a 2.2 per cent drop in the price of EasyJet, its UK rival, whose shares dropped 16p to 
700p.
British Airwayswarned yesterday that it was facing "weak" demand in the non-premium segment, "especially on the 
Atlantic", though premium traffic, where it generates most of its profits, remained "positive". BA shares fell 7 1/2p, or 
1.4 per cent, to 511 1/2p.
The Ryanair statement follows warnings by US airline executives of softening demand and creeping overcapacity in 
the domestic US market that are seen as a threat to a fragile recovery from five years of losses.
Mr O'Leary said the UK's doubling of air passenger duty on departing passengers, the doubling of airport charges at 
Stansted, its biggest base, and higher airport charges in Dublin had had an impact on passenger loads and had led 
to a "softer yield environment". Ryanair said it filled 83 per cent of its seats in April, down from 85 per cent a year 
ago, a fall which Mr O'Leary also attributed in part to the airline's 21 per cent growth in capacity. It added 27 new 
aircraft to its fleet during the winter and has opened operating bases in Marseilles, Madrid and Bremen.

The original deadline was May 11. It was then extended to June 13.
 Brussels extends deadlines by 15 working days when parties offer commitments in a bid to remove competition

bid in December last year after the commission launched the in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns'

European shares ended higher Thursday after better-than-expected U.S. economic data, strong profits from 
Unilever and Royal Dutch Shell and a court ruling on takeover target ABN Amro gave markets the impetus to claw 
their way back into positive territory.
The French CAC-40 index broke though 6,000 level for the first time since December 2000 ahead of the weekend's 
elections, closing up 0.2 percent at 6,004.28. The German DAX Xetra 30 index increased 0.3 percent to 7,479.40 
and the U.K. FTSE 100 index rose 0.8 percent to 6,537.80
U.S. shares managed to open in positive territory, giving investors hope that the index will continue its recent 
record-breaking run, after productivity of the U.S. non-farm business sector rose at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the 
first quarter.
Shares of Royal Dutch Shell rose 1.9 percent after it said that its first-quarter profit rose nearly 6 percent, with 
improving profit in its gas and power, oil products and chemicals units offsetting declining profits at its largest arm, 
exploration and production.
Unilever gained 3.9 percent after it posted an unexpected rise in first-quarter profit, as cost savings and strong 
sales volumes outweighed currency effects and higher raw material prices.
Swiss banking group UBS slipped 3.2 percent after first-quarter net profit declined 7 percent, missing analyst 
forecasts, as it also announced the closure of its Dillon Read Capital Management hedge fund. Morgan Stanley 
downgraded UBS to underweight from equal-weight, saying the decision to close the hedge fund could lead to 
"organizational turbulence."
Automaker BMW reversed early losses, closing up 1 percent after its first-quarter profit slumped 38 percent amid 
high start-up expenses for new models, rising raw materials costs and the adverse impact of exchange rates.
Ryanair fell 5.2 percent and hurt the airline sector when it said that weakness in load factors and softer yields will 
continue through the first and second quarters. Rival easyJet lost 2.2 percent.
European shares end higher
Shares of ABN Amro closed 1.9 percent higher after a Dutch judge blocked the sale of its LaSalle unit to Bank of 
America prompting hopes that a bid with a better value from a consortium led by the Royal Bank of Scotland will 
trump an agreed offer by Barclays.
Barclays climbed 3 percent. RBS shares edged 0.7 percent lower, Fortis ended 1.2 percent lower, while Banco 
Santander Central Hispano rose 1.1 percent.
Dutch supermarket chain Ahold rose 3.2 percent in Amsterdam, after it agreed to sell its U.S. Foodservices 
business to private equity firms for $7US.1 billion (€5.23 billion).
Prudential shares rose 5.6 percent after a news report that an unidentified major shareholder asked the insurance 
firm to address whether a breakup of the group would improve its value.
Hanson closed 20 percent higher after Heidelberg Cement said it may buy the U.K. construction materials firm. 
Heidelberg Cement shares tacked on 1.2 percent.
Sweden's SSAB declined 5.3 percent after it said that it has agreed to buy tube maker Ipsco for $7US.7 billion

Shares of European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc sank Thursday despite an upgrade from UBS Investment 
Research, after the company warned of softer fare trends.
The Irish company's U.S.-listed stock fell $2.48, or 5.2 percent, to $44.92 in afternoon trading after ranging between 
$23.68 and $49.72 over the past year.
Ryanair said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects weakness in occupancy levels 
and softer yields through the second quarter, due to higher airport charges. Yield is an industry measurement that 
tracks fare trends.
Ryanair said its April occupancy fell to 83 percent from 85 percent, mostly due to the effects of increased capacity.
The outlook offset an upgrade from UBS analyst Tim Marshall to "Buy." In a research report, Marshall wrote that he 
expects other analysts to boost their earnings estimates for Ryanair following recent guidance from the company.
He also cited expectations of strong revenue in Europe.

Ultra-cheap is the low-cost carriers' mantra for all seasons
Ultra-cheap is the low-cost carriers' mantra for all seasons

The US airline industry is reinventing itself.
As the line between the traditional network carriers and the incumbent low-cost rivals begins to blur, one ambitious 
new entrant believes it can carve out a niche.
However, while demand remains buoyant and the industry looks to build on its first period of consistent profitability 
in five years, executives are already looking nervously over their shoulders, warning over the past week that 
looming overcapacity threatens to undermine the pricing discipline which has driven the financial recovery.
Ohio-based Skybus is the largest of three entrants to the domestic market expected this year - arousing curiosity 
and angst in equal measure in rivals' boardrooms.
With solid financial backing from high-profile investors and local businesses, Skybus is effectively importing the 
business model pursued with ruthless efficiency by Ryanair in Europe to the land which - through Southwest - 
invented the global low-cost airline phenomenon.
Ultra-low fares and the lowest costs in the industry is the simple mantra evoked by Bill Diffenderffer, the Skybus 
chief executive who like other industry veterans in his team aims to succeed where dozens of other US start-ups 
have failed.
"We think there's pent-up demand," he said, after last week, when he announced the airline's first routes and a fare 
structure offering 10 seats on every flight at Dollars 10 each way, with services scheduled to start on May 22.
The basis of the Skybus concept has circulated in the US industry for months: use low fares to stimulate new 
demand, avoid competition by flying unserved routes to secondary destinations, minimising costs through 
outsourcing and adept use of new technology.
Moreover, revenues will be maximised by charging for services deemed "core" by rivals, boosted by advertising 
inside and outside its aircraft and a slug of non-flying business, such as hotel bookings through its website.
Ultra-cheap is the low-cost carriers' mantra for all seasons
These are measures long established in Europe byIreland-based Ryanair. But US executives are more sceptical 
about their application to the mature US domestic market.
"Passengers won't pay for everything," argues David Neeleman, founder and chief executive of JetBlue, which 
seeks to combine low fares with amenities such as leather seats and live television. Gary Kelly, Southwest's chief 
executive, says he won't "nickel and dime" passengers by charging for baggage or telephone booking.
Mr Diffenderffer says that Southwest and others have let costs spiral, and argues that overcapacity is only a 
function of the higher price point and "narrow price band" at which rivals operate. Skybus sold 60,000 tickets on its 
first day, and he believes the majority were discretionary travellers unable to afford fares at other carriers.
Skybus is targeting routes without non-stop competition from its Columbus base, serving a metro area with a 
population of 1.6m, and 6.7m within a 100-mile drive. "We don't try to fight anyone head-on," says Mr Diffenderffer. 
However, such a nugget will not have escaped the attention of Southwest, JetBlue, AirTran and others, which 
continue to grow annual capacity at more than 10 per cent and remain hungry for "underserved" markets.
Mr Diffenderffer, a former executive at IBM and System-One, a travel distributor, insists that Skybus will maintain a 
competitive advantage, flying its Airbus A319s - it has 65 on order - more than 14 hours a day. Most of its flight 
attendants are part-time, and its non-unionised pilots are eligible for two-thirds of the company's stock options, 
keeping cash compensation costs down at a time when labour expenses in the industry are on the rise.
Executing the claimed cost advantage will be one of two key tests for Skybus, the other being its solid belief that 
there is untapped demand in a US market at a time when network carriers prefer to expand more profitable 
international routes.
The initial Skybus fleet of 13-14 leased aircraft includes planes earmarked for Virgin America, another start-up 
whose launch has been delayed by long-running efforts to secure regulatory clearance. ExpressJet, which operates 
regional services for network carriers, recently launched its own-brand airline, flying unserved routes with strong 
business demand, rather than passengers currently priced out of the market.
More than 150 US airlines have come and gone since deregulation in 1978, and Skybus is viewed as one of the 
boldest ventures to date. "We think the low-cost business is better than it was three years ago," says Mr 
Diffenderffer.

The merger merry-go-round that is Europe's travel industry is set for another important turn this week, as the 
European Commission prepares to announce its regulatory assessment of theproposed tie-up between Thomas 
Cook and MyTravel on Friday.
The Brussels antitrust watchdog must decide whether to clear the deal or launch an in-depth probe that will prolong 
the legal uncertainty for investors and executives by another four to five months.
Though the companies are confident they will win backing from Brussels eventually, people familiar with the case 
say it is still unclear whether the Commission will wave the deal through at this early stage.
What complicates the picture for the Commission's antitrust department is that Thomas Cook and MyTravel are not 
alone in their quest for scale. Tui and First Choice have also announced a merger plan, notifying their deal to 
Brussels less than two weeks after their rivals. This means the Commission is looking at a market in which four 
leading groups will suddenly shrink to two - a development that at first glance must give rise to very serious 
competition concerns.
Recent history is not encouraging. When MyTravel (at the time the company called itself Airtours) and First Choice 
tried to merge in 1999, the Commission blocked the deal, arguing the tie-up would create a dominant position in the 
UK market for short-haul foreign package holidays.
Though the ruling was later overturned in court, the Commission's eventual defeat did nothing to detract from the 
fact that at the time Brussels saw travel as a market prone to cause competition problems.
In their defence, Thomas Cook and MyTravel argue that the tour operator market has undergone a revolution since 
the 1999 ruling. Most importantly, they say the relentless rise of low-cost airlines and the abundance of travel 
offerings on the internet has made the travel industry much more competitive - as demonstrated by the 
comparatively low margins of tour operators.
Commission's holiday ruling on the horizon
They believe that the Commission should not look at the four big operators inisolation but expand its definition of 
the market to include the new competitors. At the very least, they claim Brussels should acknowledge that online 
travel providers such as Expedia and no-frills airlines like Ryanair would act as a massive competitive constraint on 
the remaining two or three groups.
It is an argument certain to feature prominently in the submissions by Tui and First Choice, who will stress that even 
two remaining groups could not act in a manner that undermines competition and harms consumers.
But should the Commission ultimately decide that the market can withstand one merger but not two, Thomas Cook 
and MyTravel have a clear advantage over their rivals. For a start, the Tui/First Choice tie-up comfortably outweighs 
the rival merger in terms of sales, customers, staff and aircraft.
More important, however, is the time factor. Because they were first to notify their deal to Brussels, the Commission 
must - in theory at least - treat their tie-up as a four-to-three merger, while Tui and First Choice would be asking the 
regulator to clear a deal that cuts the number of tour operators to just two.
According to people in the Tui/First Choice camp, correspondence sent by the Commission to third parties seeking 
their views on the industry appears to relateto the two mergers at the same time.
This could indicate that the regulator is, at the very least, keen to understand how the Thomas Cook/MyTravel deal 
would play out in a market of just two integrated tour operators.
But the rules are clear, and they force the Commission to stick with the principle of "first-come-first-served".
Twelve days is all that separates the two mergers, yet they could prove crucial in the end.

No-frills airline Ryanair today opened three new routes from Dublin to Alicante , Bydgoszcz and Gdansk. 
Alicante becomes Ryanair's 12th Spanish route from Dublin while the addition of Bydgoszcz and Gdansk brings 
Ryanair's Polish routes from Dublin to eight.
Speaking today, Ryanair's head of communications, Peter Sherrard said, "In the coming year over 130,000 
passengers will enjoy Ryanair's lowest fares and best punctuality on these 3 new routes, saving over E6m 
compared to the high fares charged by Aer Lingus. Irish tourism has benefited enormously from the 43 new low fare 
routes that Ryanair has launched from Dublin in the past year."

Body
A sluggish Dublin market closed modestly higher this evening, with gains in Kingspan and CRH outweighing falls in 
Smurfit Kappa.
Although the Irish Stock Exchange remained open for business today there was no electronic trading. The ISEXetra 
trading system was unavailable as the system is operated from Frankfurt, where markets were closed for the May 
Day holiday.
Trading was extremely light, with just over 3 million shares changing hands.
 The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 18.52 points higher at 9,489.00. Kingspan and CRH were two of the 
session's biggest gainers, jumping 25c to 20.85 and 15c to 32.40 respectively, while elsewhere in the building 
sector, Grafton added 10c to 11.00 and McInerney tacked on 10c to close at 14.00. AIB and Bank of Ireland both 
led the way among the financial, climbing 4c to 22.33 and 10c to 15.85 respectively. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 5c to 
16.50 as investors await the release of its interim results next week. Davy Stockbrokers said it is looking for profit 
before tax growth of 48pc to E557m for the six months to the end of March. Shares in Anglo Irish are up 4pc so far 
this year, which is in line with its European peers. Davy analyst, Scott Rankin, said it remains the one Irish financial 
that has not been affected by negative newsflow on the domestic housing market and rising rates. However, it 
warned that any evidence that the slowdown is feeding into the commercial market could change this. Elsewhere in 
the sector, Irish Life and Permanent closed unchanged on 19.50, despite suggestions that Irish Nationwide could be 
put up for sale in the next ten days. Irish Life has been mentioned in the past as a potential buyer has previously 
said that if the building society was put up for sale, it would take a look. Smurfit Kappa was on the of the days 
biggest fallers, slipping 7c to 20.03. Shares in the company fell on profit taking after two of the brokers that 
managed its flotation last week gave glowing assessments of the stock's prospects. Goldman Sachs said Smurfit 
Kappa is "the best placed in the paper packaging sector to benefit from price increases for corrugated boxes", while 
Davy placed a price target of E23.50 on the shares. Brokers had been barred from commenting on the shares until 
ISEQ closes higher on Kingspan, CRH
the 30-day blackout period following the initial public offering expired last Tuesday. Other notable movers today 
included food group Kerry, up 16c to 22.10, no frills airline Ryanair, up 3c to 6.10, and diagnostics firm Trinity 
Biotech, up 5c to 1.95. Donegal Creameries was down 10c to 7.00, while Blackrock International fell 1c to 0.46 after 
it earlier this week confirmed that it has formed a new joint venture with Applecross Properties Limited to develop its 
8.82 acre site in Edinburgh. It is anticipated that the project will have a gross development value in excess of 
E117m. Elsewhere, banana group Fyffes was up 3c to 1.03, while Independent News and Media tacked on 2c to 
end the day at 3.45.

Body
It is believed that the European Commission has laid the legal groundwork to force Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair to 
dispose of a portion or the entirety of its 25.17% holding in Irish carrier Aer Lingus. 
The EC is set to decide by June 13 whether Ryanair can take over Aer Lingus. If it does block the merger, the EU 
would be poised to take the next step and order the disposal of holdings. 
The EC claims Ryanair purchased 19% of Aer Lingus shares in the 10 days prior to launching its takeover bid; 
5.17% thereafter. 
The main objection is that Ryanair would lock up the Irish air market if it acquired the partly state-owned carrier, 
leading to higher prices for travellers.   It is likely that Ryanair will appeal such a decision to the European Court of 
Justice, which would have the final say.

Highlight: Sharp falls in leading construction and financial shares dragged the Dublin market over 1pc lower today.
Body
Sharp falls in leading construction and financial shares dragged the Dublin market over 1pc lower today.
Investor sentiment was hit by the news that house prices in Ireland fell for the first time in more than five years 
during March. Figures released today showed that the average cost of buying a house in Ireland was down 0.6pc 
last month versus the previous month.
The news raised fears that the current slowdown in U.S. housing is spreading across the Atlantic. House prices in 
Ireland have not fallen since January 2002.
 Shares were also hit by confidence surveys out of France and Italy that came in well above forecasts, leaving a 
eurozone interest rate hike to 4.0pc in June all but a certainty, with a strong chance of a further hike after that. 
Howard Archer at Global Insight said there is now 'significant speculation' that the ECB will raise rates beyond 
4.0pc. On top of that, the news that the U.S. dollar had fallen to an all-time low against the euro came as bad news 
to several Irish firms. A weak dollar is seen as bad news for companies such as CRH and AIB who do a lot of 
business in the U.S. These firms will lose in the long-term as they report their financial results in euro. The 
greenback suffered a torrid time today after U.S. first quarter GDP figures came in well below expectations. The 
euro surged to a new all-time record high of 1.3682 against the dollar before dropping back slightly. Shares in CRH 
were hit hardest, down 43c to 31.86. The building materials group derives 51pc of its revenue from the U.S. 
Meanwhile, shares in Ireland's largest bank AIB fell 51c to 22.35. It owns a 24pc stake in the American bank 
MandT. Those falls were reminiscent of the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares ending the session 
130.62 points lower at 9,470.62. Other financial shares also ended the week on a negative note, with Bank of 
Ireland down 42c to 15.74, Anglo Irish Bank down 11c to 16.44 and Irish Life and Permanent down 17c to 19.35. In 
the construction sector Grafton closed 46c lower at 10.68, while Kingspan fell 24c to 20.55 and McInerney slipped 
10c to 14.25. Housebuilder Abbey ended the day almost 3pc, or 28c, lower at 11.05. Other notable movers included 
drinks group CandC, up 3c to 12.60, no frills airline Ryanair, down 6c to 6.16, media group UTV, up 15c to 6.25, 
ISEQ dragged 1.5pc lower by CRH , AIB
and food group IAWS, up 10c to 18.02. Aer Lingus was down 3c to 3.10, while Independent News and Media 
slipped 3c to 3.47. Elsewhere on the market, diagnostics company Trinity Biotech continued to bask in the glow of 
its impressive first quarter earnings figures, released on Thursday. Shares in the company rose by over 4pc for the 
second session running after it said that profits during the three months to end of March rose 135pc to USD2.71m. 
The results came in well-ahead of expectations. The company said that prospects for the remainder of 2007 were 
excellent. Shares were up 8c to 2.00 today. Elan ended a miserable week in negative territory, down 20c to 10.28. 
The pharmaceutical company earlier this week said that losses during the first quarter of the year had more than 
doubled to USD92m.

Body
Trinity Biotech was the main mover on the Dublin market today after it posted an impressive trading update for the 
first quarter.
Shares in the diagnostics firm soared by more than 11pc, or 20c, to 1.92, after it said that profits during the three 
months to the end of March rose 135pc to USD2.71m.
The company also said that revenues during the period were up 49pc to USD36.7m, compared to USD36.7m in the 
first quarter last year. The company said that prospects for the remainder of 2007 were excellent. Trinity Biotech 
develops, acquires, manufactures and markets over 500 diagnostic products for the point-of-care and clinical 
laboratory segments of the diagnostic market. The broad line of test kits are used to detect infectious diseases, 
sexually transmitted diseases, blood coagulation disorders, and auto-immune diseases. 
 When its Q1 figures are broken down, they show that revenues from its European operations rose by 65pc to 
USD11.4m, while revenues from the US were up 38pc to almost USD17m. In Asia and Africa, revenues increased 
by 51pc to USD8.3m. Trinity's strong performance helped the overall ISEQ to recover from heavy falls during the 
previous two days. The index ended the session 58.66 points higher at 9,601.24. Investor sentiment remained high 
throughout the day in Dublin, despite a sluggish opening on Wall Street. U.S. stocks were little changed as strong 
profit reports from names like Apple and 3M failed to galvanise the markets a day after the Dow Jones industrials 
crossed the 13,000 mark. Investors often tread water and reassess valuations after stocks push through technical 
or psychological barriers, dealers said. Back in Dublin, shares in Smurfit Kappa made decent headway, adding on 
65c to 20.35, after the Packaging Corporation of America confirmed a USD40 per tonne increase in containerboard 
prices from next month. Davy said this will result in even further tightening in Europe, which is positive for Smurfit 
Kappa. In the financial sector Anglo Irish Bank was the star performer, climbing 19c to 16.55, while AIB added on 
2c to 22.86. Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent both slipped into the red, however, down 11c to 16.16

and Abbey flat at 11.33. Ryanair turned in a sluggish performance, down 2c to 6.22, despite it confirming a total of 
seven new routes from its base in Bremen. Shares in Aer Lingus were up 3c to 3.13. Drinks group CandC was up 
17c to 12.57 after new custom and excise data revealed a re-acceleration of growth in cider clearances in the UK 
after a slowdown in December and January. Other notable movers included Irish Continental Group, up 35c to 
21.00, Qualceram Shires, up 3c to 2.10, and Readymix, up 11c to 2.97. United Drug added on 5c to 4.00, while

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it was expanding its route network for its newest hub in Bremen, northwest 
Germany.
Europe's largest no-frills airline said it planned to open seven new routes in mid-September, taking the total number 
of routes to 18, just weeks after opening services in Bremen.
New twice-weekly services would link Bremen with Alghero in Sardinia and Trapani in Sicily; three-times weekly 
with the Slovak capital of Bratislava, Malta and Stockholm; four-times weekly with Italy's financial capital, Milan; and 
daily with Paris.
It said this would mean basing a third Boeing 737-800 in Bremen.
Sean Coyle, Ryanair's director of scheduled revenue, said the expansion plan would mean "even more choice and 
even more low fares for German consumers who want to escape from the high fares and fuel surcharges of 
Lufthansa."

These 7 new routes will start in September, when Ryanair will add a third brand new Boeing 737-800 to the base, 
bringing the airline's total investment in Bremen to over USD220 million. Announcing the new routes, Sean Coyle, 
Ryanair's director of scheduled revenue said, "Ryanair's Bremen base has been a tremendous success from day 
one and our E220m investment in the airport will deliver over 1 million passengers in the coming year, sustaining 
1,000 jobs and generating a visitor spend of over E150m. Today's package of 7 additional routes means even more

Shares in Irish Life and Permanent slumped by over 3pc this morning as the Dublin market made a disappointing 
start to the session.
Just before 1100, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 41.34 points to 9,532.05.
Irish banks and other quoted equities with links to the property market were again hit by fears over the Spanish 
property market..
 Spain's overpriced property stocks came crashing down yesterday, with panic selling in the real estate sector 
signalling the end of a 10-year-old construction boom. The sell-off dragged down related industries such as 
construction and banking and caused a 2.7pc drop in the Ibex 35 index of leading shares. The fall also rippled 
through other European markets as investors worried about its knock-on effects. Financial shares in Dublin were 
also hit by a series of ratings changes by Moody's. AIB and Bank of Ireland, both had their rating upgraded from 
Aa3 to Aa2, while Anglo Irish Bank was re-rated to A1 from a previous rating of A2. Irish Life and Permanent was 
moved from a rating of A1 to Aa3. Shares in Irish Life and Permanent were down 65c to 19.85, while AIB slipped 8c

Shares in Elan plummeted by almost 6pc today after the pharmaceutical group posted a disappointing trading 
update for the first quarter.
Elan said that losses widened during the first three months of the year to USD92m, up from USD32m in the same 
quarter in 2006. The company blamed the rise on the costs of developing it's key Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's 
drugs. The loss came despite a rise in revenues to USD176m from USD134.3m. 
It said global sales of the Tysabri MS treatment, developed with U.S. partner Biogen Idec, were USD48.4 million in 
the first quarter, with 9,100 patients being treated with it by mid April. Davy Stockbrokers described the performance 
as "solid if unspectacular". The update was given the cold shoulder by investors, with shares closing 67c lower at 
10.56 this evening.
 The performance was indicative of the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares closing 128.10 points 
lower at 9,573.39. Shares in Blackrock International also fell sharply, down 4pc, 2c, to 0.47 after a leading 
stockbroker this week lowered its price target for the property company. Goodbody Stockbrokers shaved 14pc off 
its target after Blackrock indicated that it could take up to seven years to realise the full potential of five 
development sites. The company's portfolio has been valued at around E105m, however, they could be worth 
around E230m if redeveloped, Goodbody said. The broker said its previous target of 63c had been based on 
expectations that the development work would be finished within three years. That target has now been cut to 54c. 
Financial shares also weighed heavy on the market, with Anglo Irish Bank down 25c to 16.40, Bank of Ireland down 
27c to 16.08 and Irish Life and Permanent down 24c to 20.49. AIB was also in the red, down 16c to 22.80. In the 
construction sector, CRH was a notable faller, down 44c to 31.85, while Kingspan slipped 45c to 20.20. 
Housebuilder McInerney fell 15c to 15.10, while Grafton lost 34c to 11.17 and Abbey dropped 22c to 11.50.

Arklow for E2m. The site is expected to be placed on the market this week, with a closing deadline of June 7. 
Goodbody estimates that the re-development valued of the site could be worth approximately E22m. Shares in the 
company closed 2c higher at 2.07 today. Other notable movers included bookmaker Paddy Power, down 28c to 
19.95, no-frills airline Ryanair, down 11c to 6.20, and media group UTV, down 15c to 6.20. Drinks group CandC 
was also in the red, down 6c to 12.29, while insurance group FBD Holdings fell 40c to 40.60. Having traded sharply 
lower for virtually all of the session, the performance of Irish shares was not helped by a slow start on Wall Street. 
U.S. stocks turned mixed as disappointing housing and consumer confidence data countered another batch of 
stronger-than-expected Q1 corporate earnings. The National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing 
homes in March had their biggest one-month decline since January 1989. Meanwhile the Conference Board 
reported consumer confidence fell more than expected in April due to higher gas prices and broader economic 
concerns.

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair looks set to become launch customer for OnAir's airborne mobile telephony system by 
dispensing with a commercial trial of the service. Speaking at Aircraft Interiors Expo 2007 in Hamburg last week, 
OnAir chief commercial officer Graham Lake said that although Air France remained the first carrier scheduled to 
test the service on an Airbus A318, the timescale had slipped and the six-month pilot was not now due to start until 
summer. Air France will operate the system on a new aircraft with the equipment factory-fitted and will, if satisfied, 
seek a retrofit solution for a fleet roll-out centred on the carrier's A318 fleet initially. 
The first three months will test data-only applications - SMS and email via BlackBerry - with a full service including 
voice to be tested from September onwards.Ryanair, meanwhile, wants to start retrofitting its whole 200-aircraft 
fleet of Boeing aircraft from September, and start operating the full, dual complement of data and voice services by 
year-end on a number of aircraft operating out of London Stansted.Airlines BMI and TAP also plan trials on Airbus 
aircraft, but these have been hampered by aircraft availability. OnAir's Lake says it is discussing with the airlines an 
appropriate C check window in which to fit the equipment and that three-month trials on both aircraft are expected 
to start during the last quarter of 2007."Both airlines continue to be actively engaged in implementing the 
programme," says Lake, who adds that aviation safety regulator EASA is expected to issue certification by the end 
of May.Both OnAir and rival service provider Aeromobile report good progress in regulatory roaming approval, with 
Aeromobile's marketing director David Coiley reporting that consent has been secured from 30 countries. Qantas 
last week started testing the Aeromobile data services on one of the airline's Boeing 767-200s with passengers on 
some domestic flights able to send and receive emails and text messages using their own mobile devices.Over the 
next three months passengers travelling on this aircraft will be permitted to use a mobile phone or other mobile 
devices such as a BlackBerry to send and receive messages.However, US Federal Communication Commission 
officials earlier this month suspended moves towards lifting the country's ban on the in-flight use of cellphones, 
citing "insufficient technical information" on whether their use on board aircraft "may cause harmful interference to 
terrestrial networks".

JetBlue is examining the potential for in-flight text messaging, highlighting efforts by US carriers to exploit on-board 
communications as a way to boost revenues and differentiate their service.
David Neeleman, JetBlue founder and chief executive, shares the misgivings of many US airline executives about 
the on-board use of mobile phones for voice calls, but said text communications could prove attractive.
JetBlue was the first US carrier to offer live television on its aircraft, and bought additional radio spectrum in a 
federal auction this year which could be applied to launch the US first in-flight texting service.
European carriers are at the forefront of introducing mobile phone technology, with Air France-KLM due to start a 
six-month trial on short-haul routes, while Ryanair has announced plans to equip all of its aircraft to allow mobile 
phone use.
Southwest Airlines, the largest domestic carrier in the US, last week said it was exploring in-flight wireless access 
as part of its own shift away from a "no-frills" business model. This comes at a time when network carriers such as 
Delta are narrowing the expense gap with low-cost rivals after restructuring under bankruptcy protection.
JetBlue's assessment comes as the carrier seeks to rebuild its popular following among travellers after a series of 
delays and cancellations in February prompted Congressional hearings into airline service standards.
Mr Neeleman, who apologised again at a House hearing last week, has received plaudits for accepting 
responsibility for the problems, which will see the carrier report a first-quarter loss today.
JetBlue responded with a passenger "bill of rights" offering a sliding scale of payments and refunds for delays 
deemed to be in the carrier's control. But Mr Neeleman and fellow airline CEOs have rejected calls for a federally-
mandated passenger charter, arguing the proposals would add to delays and compromise operations.

Tony Fernandes, chief executive of AirAsia, the leading Asian low-cost airline, is planning return fares for routes 
between Europe and Malaysia at Pounds 130-Pounds 170 (Dollars 260-Dollars 340) when he launches the world's 
first low-cost long-haul scheduled carrier since Freddie Laker's UK ill-fated Skytrain and the US Peoplexpress 
ventures 30 years ago.
The pioneering venture, which will be followed closely by global network carriers fearful of the threat such start-ups 
could pose to their traditional businesses, was aiming at fares 50 per cent to 60 per cent below the lowest offered 
by other airlines, Mr Fernandes told the Financial Times yesterday.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, the leading European low-cost short-haul carrier, said two weeks ago 
that he was considering launching a similar venture between Europe and the US in three to four years.
"Someone will do the Pacific to North Asia and Europe to the US," said Mr Fernandes, "and passengers will be able 
to connect themselves to local short-haulairlines. You don't need formal links."
Plans for the long-haul business were announced yesterday in Kuala Lumpur with the start planned for late this 
year or 2008, depending on the availability of leased aircraft.
For its long-term development, the venture said it had chosen the Airbus A330-300 in preference to the Boeing 777. 
It said it was placing a firm order to buy 10 A330-300s with options on a further five. Deliveries would start in the 
fourth quarter of 2008.
Mr Fernandes, a former music industry executive who started Asia's first short-haul low-cost carrier in 2001, said 
the long-haul venture could be flying 10mpassengers a year within five years with a fleet of 26 aircraft.
AirAsia to take off in low-cost, long-haul flights TRANSPORT FT INTERVIEW Kevin Done talks to Tony 
Fernandes, whose aim is to fly 10m passengers within five yea....
The airline, which will be based in the Malaysian capital, would develop a network of medium and long-haul routes 
to China, India, the Middle East, Australia, Japan, Korea and Europe, including London Stansted, Europe's biggest 
centre for low-cost operations.
The duration of flights would be in the range of four and 12 hours with an average of about seven hours. "Medium-
haul in Asia is the sweet spot," said Mr Fernandes.
The launch route is expected to be to Australia with Europe to follow within six months.
The airline would offer a single-class product with many of the classic features of established short-haul low-cost 
carriers, including food and drinks purchased on board and pay-for-use in-flight entertainment.
Mr Fernandes said that Dollars 20m had already been raised in a first funding round with himself and three other 
AirAsia executives included as investors. Credit Suisse was working on a second funding round through a private 
placement.
Where possible, the venture would use cheaper secondary airports, and preferably locations already well-served by 
regional low-cost carriers, such as London Stansted, so that long-haul travellers could make their own connections 
by local short-haul carriers.
"We will strive to make Malaysia the world's biggest low-cost hub," he said.

A sluggish Dublin market ended the session unchanged today despite sharp gains in bathroom furnishings firm 
Qualceram Shires.
Shares in the company were up almost 3pc, or 5c, to 2.05 after it confirmed that it has completed the acquisition of 
the freehold of the group's facility at South Quay, Arklow, Co Wicklow from the Arklow Harbour Commissioners for 
E2m. It intends to sell the entire site and relocate to a new, custom-built manufacturing and international distribution 
centre. The site is expected to be put on the market by tender this week.
However, those gains failed to inspire the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares closing 2.19 points 
lower at 9,701.49.
 Financial shares threw up something of a mixed bag. AIB led the way, up 21c to 22.91, while Anglo Irish Bank 
tacked on 31c to 16.72. Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank were both slightly lower, down 2c to 16.53 and 1c to 
20.79 respectively. Elsewhere, Elan was up 37c to 11.22 ahead of its first quarter earnings report, due out 
tomorrow. Davy said it was looking for global Tysabri revenues of USD56m, with 70pc of this accruing in the US 
(USD39m). "This would represent a near doubling of the fourth quarter 2006 outturn," Davy analyst Jack Gorman 
said. Investors will be particularly keen for an update on sales of its multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. CRH was the 
biggest faller in the construction sector, down 17c to 32.29, while Kingspan fell 14c to 20.65 and McInerney slipped 
3c to 15.25. Grafton bucked the trend, climbing 7c to 11.52. Other notable movers included drinks group C and C, 
down 24c to 12.35, scaffolding and fencing group Siteserv, down 15c to 0.92, and banana group Fyffes, down 4c to 
1.06. Elsewhere, no frills airline Ryanair fell 2c to 6.31, Aer Lingus tacked on 3c to 3.20 and Iona Technologies 
jumped 5c to 4.20. Shares in Paddy Power were 17c to 20.23. The bookmaker announced last week that it had 
signed a five-year deal with Amalgamted Racing (Turf TV) for live pictures from 31 race courses in the UK. Davy 
said the contract will give Paddy Power "a competitive edge" over its UK counterparts. TURF TV has been set up in 
conjunction with 31 race courses that are unhappy with the revenues that they have been receiving from SIS for live

pictures. SIS, which is part owned by William Hill and Ladbrokes, has had a monopoly position over the television 
rights up to now. None of the major UK bookmakers has as yet signed up with TURF TV, making Paddy Power the 
largest operator to date to do so. "This may mean additional incremental revenues for Power as customers may be 
enticed into Paddy Power shops to view races that are not available elsewhere," Davy's David Jennings said. 
Across the pond, Wall Street was higher as investors became enthusiastic about earnings reports and new 
takeover activity, but nervous about extending the Dow Jones' record-breaking run. Investors have so far stopped 
short of propelling the Dow industrials past the 13,000 mark.

The Dublin market soared by over 1pc today on the back of sharp gains in the likes of Smurfit Kappa, Aer Lingus 
and Donegal Creameries.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 101.91 points higher at 9,703.68, bringing an end to three days of 
consecutive losses.
Shares in Smurfit Kappa ended the session over 2pc, or 44c, higher at 20.09, while Aer Lingus closed 7c higher at 
3.17 after it announced an 8pc rise in passengers numbers during March. The airline said it carried a total of 
731,000 people during the month, up from 677,000 in the same period last year. The performance was helped by 
short haul traffic that rose 11.9pc. In the year to March, total passengers numbers rose by 6pc to 1,952,000.
 Donegal Creameries also made decent headway after it posted a 15pc rise in pre-tax profits to E4.1 m. Shares in 
Donegal Creameries rose by over 5pc early in the session before falling back to close 5c higher at 6.85. The 
company said the increase in profits was mainly the result of gains from property. Turnover during the year was up 
6.2pc from E111.7 m in 2005 to E118.6 m in 2006. Financial shares were also mainly higher. AIB was up an 
impressive 46c to 22.47, while bank of Ireland added on 20c to 16.55 and Anglo Irish Bank jumped 10c to 16.40. 
Shares in Irish Life & Permanent bucked the trend, falling 25c to 20.80. Elsewhere, construction shares put in a 
similar performance, with CRH leading the way, up 61c to 32.40. Shares in Grafton were up 18c to 11.35, while 
Kingspan tacked on 5c to 20.79 and McInerney added on 11c to 15.28. Other notable risers included no-frills airline 
Ryanair, up 6c to 6.32, United Drug, up 10c to 4.10, and drinks group C&C, up 7c to 12.60. However, the market 
was not without its fallers. Shares in Calyx were down 6pc, or 8c, to 1.33 on profit taking after the IT systems 
provider this week posted a 29pc increase in full-year pretax profit to E2.2m. The company also confirmed that it 
has formed an independent sub-committee of the board to consider last month's bid approach from chief executive 
and company founder Maurice Healy. Meanwhile, software provider IONA Technologies was down 20c to 4.15, 
while bookmaker Paddy Power fell 30c to 20.15. Elsewhere today, shares in FBD Holdings ended the week in 
ISEQ soars 1pc on Smurfit, AL & Donegal
buoyant fashion, jumping 95c to 41.25. Shares in the insurance group have soared this week after it confirmed that 
shareholders will share a E177m pay-back from the firm's reserves. The deal will see shareholders receive over E5 
per share as FBD reaffirms its commitment to maximise shareholder value. The company had previously indicated 
that it would return capital to shareholders if it failed to find suitable avenues in which to reinvest the money. 
"Following its assessment of the group's capital requirements in the context of its ambitious growth plans, the board 
has determined that E177m of capital will not be required to pursue those plans," Chairman Michael Berkery said. 
The money will be paid on June 27 to those shareholders registered as of June 8.

Southwest seeks new sources of passenger revenue AVIATION
Southwest seeks new sources of passenger revenue AVIATION

Body
Southwest Airlines, which provided the template for low-cost carriers, yesterday announced a three-year 
transformation plan to deal with the "permanent" increase in fuel prices.
Dallas-based Southwest is the largest and most efficient US passenger carrier. Its plan to find new revenue sources 
could widen the competitive gap which network carriers such as Delta and United have closed after years of 
restructuring.
Southwest yesterday reported its 64th straight quarter of profitability, a record unmatched in the industry, but will 
experiment with measures which could alter the "keeping it simple" business model emulated by carriers such as 
Ryanair and Easyjet in Europe, and AirAsia. The airline, which insisted that it was not interested in a leveraged buy-
out, is losing the edge it had over rivals as fuel hedging contracts start to unwind.
Southwest was one of the few carriers able to buy protection during the ramp-up in fuel prices in 2004, which have 
pushed up unit costs at the airline by a third over the past three years. The plans outlined by Gary Kelly, chief 
executive, borrow heavily from measures introduced by Ryanair and others, driving more non-flying revenue such 
as hotel bookings from its website, and charging passengers for a broader array of services, including the potential 
for in-flight wireless access.
Southwest's efficiency and ability to set prices in the US market reflects a strategy which eliminates many of the 
complexities of rivals. It uses a single aircraft type, with no assigned seating or on-board food, except peanuts.
Mr Kelly said a business operating almost 500 aircraft and carrying 21m passengers last year had "hidden assets" 
which would allow it to boost average revenues. These include carrying more cargo, looking at the potential of 
international flights and alliances with other carriers,and providing in-flight internet services.
The efforts to create a more competitive Southwest - which continues to expand into more of the network carrier's 
core domestic markets - comes as its rivals recover from the heavy losses suffered since 2001, most of them after a 
bankruptcy process which eliminated more than 120,000 jobs. While the industry expects to move into profit this 
Southwest seeks new sources of passenger revenue AVIATION
year, after effectively breaking even in 2006, executives warned this week that overcapacity could threaten their 
ability to sustain higher earnings and rebuild battered balance sheets.
Mr Kelly declined to comment on LBO speculation but said he opposed any move which would leverage 
Southwest's balance sheet up to the levels of rivals.

The bidding battle that has finally broken out for Alliance Boots saw the shares add 8.08% which sent them straight 
to the top of the FTSE 100 leader board with an 84.75p gain to £11.3425.
It was a long way ahead of the next biggest riser, Standard Chartered, the best of the banks with 49p rise to £15.19, 
up 3.33%.
Although the £10.90-a-share offer from the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts consortium has been recommended to 
shareholders by the health to pharmaceutical group, few dealers think that's the end of the story which is why 
nearly 80 million Alliance Boots shares went through the market, making it the second most active stock after 
Vodafone, up 2.6p to 142.9p, with 212 million.
As the Standard Chartered price rises suggests, the other takeover race for ABN Amro has stimulated the banking 
sector. Barclays added 21p to 759p and HBOS 11p to £10.79. The Royal Bank of Scotland, 4p better at £20.18, is 
seeing ANB Amro on Monday.
Sentiment was helped by Wall Street on hopes that the Dow Jones industrial index will continue its six-day winning 
streak.
Trading was brisk at the opening in London, but prices didn't take off until around 10.30 am when shares started 
moving towards a 12:15 pm high of 6,497.9, up 57.3 points. At 1:11 pm the FTSE 100 was 51.1 points up to 
6,491.7.
The other key indices moved higher with the FTSE 250 going 90.9 points better to 11,889.4. Trading was below 
average with 167,353 deals involving 1.16 billion shares.
Only 12 of the leading 100 shares went down, led by Intercontinental Hotels, 22p lower at £12.33. WPP fell 1.5p to 
769.5p after disappointing revenue news, while Shell A shares lost a penny to £17.37.
Air Lingus, 0.0575 or 1.85% better at 3.1575, is rated a buy by broker Collins Stewart. If the European regulatory 
authorities block the bid from Ryanair, as has been suggested, the broker feels that the low-cost airline would not 
sell its stake which effectively blocks a bid from anywhere else. Ryanair shares added 0.062 to 6.323.
Despite 'highly impressive' first-half figures from WH Smith, up 5p to 448.75p, broker Bridgewell is unenthusiastic 
on the shares and has put out a neutral note.
Friday Lunchtime Market: FTSE boosted as bid battles come into the open
Evolution Securities sees Aviva, 10.25p higher at 774.25p, as a buy ahead of the new business figures due on 
Tuesday which may be good enough to trigger a re-rating of the shares, it says.
In the FTSE 250, vague talk of a management buy out at EMI boosted the shares a halfpenny to 237.25p with 8.2 
million changing hands. Biggest FTSE 250 mover was PartyGaming, 3.25p up to 55.25p, which with 40 million 
shares changing hands was also the most active.
Continuing takeover talk regarding Societe Generale and Vallourec helped drive shares higher in Paris where at 
12:59 pm the French CAC-40 was 78.8 points up to 5,907.84.
The recovery of shares in Asian markets was the reason behind the increase in Frankfurt share prices where SAP 
and Siemens were the fast risers of the morning. At 1:09 pm the German DAX 30 was 104.14 points higher at 
7,346.88.
In international currency markets the pound was little changed in terms of the US dollar, moving from the overnight 
$2.0040 to $2.0038 although it did drop briefly below the $2-mark ahead of the retail sales figure announcement. It 
was firmer against the euro at 1.4727 against 1.4707.

Ryanair was one of few bright spots on the Dublin market today, with shares soaring over 2pc.
The airline announced earlier this week that it was closing three routes from Stockholm and replacing them with 
three new destinations. Ryanair will no longer fly to Brussels, Kaunas and Gdansk. However, new routes have been 
added to Alghero (Sardinia), Marseilles and Venice.
The news was welcomed by the market, with shares in Ryanair closing 13c higher at 6.25.
 Those gains had little impact on the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares closing 31 points lower at 
9,601.77. Investor sentiment had been hit earlier in the day by a slump in Chinese stocks keeping many dealers in 
a cautious mood. However, a string of strong earnings reports from the US offered a little more confidence ahead of 
the close, dealers said. In Dublin, the financial weighed heavy on the market, with AIB down 11c to 22.01, Anglo 
Irish Bank down 7c to 16.30 and Irish Life and Permanent down 20c to 21.05. Bank of Ireland managed to buck the 
negative trend, tacking on 2c to 16.35. In the construction sector, CRH was another notable faller, down 39c to

among the builders, adding on 2c to 15.17. Shares in Iona Technologies plummeted over 4pc, or 20c, to 4.15 as it 
prepares to release its first quarter results on Tuesday. Earlier this month, the IT company confirmed the purchase 
of US technology firm Logicblaze. Drinks group C and C's recent resurgence continued yesterday as the recent 
spell of hot weather looks like lasting into the weekend. Shares were up 21c to 12.53. Elsewhere, shares in 
bookmaker Paddy Power, which have rocketed over 20pc during the last six weeks, fell 18c to 20.45. Amarin was a 
big mover, jumping 15c to 2.55, after Goodbody Stockbrokers said shares in the Dublin-based drug development 
firm have the potential to more than double in value on the back of two major drugs trials for its Huntingtons disease 
treatment. It warned, however, that it is a high-risk stock dependent on a 'binary decision' on its Miraxion drug. 
Goodbody has put a price target of USD7.50 on the share. Analyst, Gavin Lyng, has raised his recommendation on 
the firm's shares from 'Add' to 'Buy' saying that he currently puts the value of Amarin in the USD 7.95 to USD12.97

range (mid-point USD10.46), which is considerably higher than USD3.24 it is currently priced at. In an 18-page 
report, he noted that Miraxion has completed two Phase III trials in the US without set back. The trials were 
designed with a Special Protocol Assessment in place, meaning that it received special status as a potentially 
important advancement in the treatment of the debilitating disease. Mr Lyng also noted that there is currently no 
treatment on the market targeting Huntington's. 'We believe that the risk is to the upside that the drug will be 
approved for the treatment of a sub-sector of HD patients,' he added. 'Our price target of USD5.70 represents the 
weighted combination of the minimum potential upside (USD7.95 at 0.7 probability) and downside (USD0.50 at 0.3 
probability) to the stock in its binary situation. Although this is around 90pc ahead of the current price, it would only 
have the stock trading at 16.1 times full-year 08 earnings, a considerable discount to peers with drugs on the 
market, who are trading at an average of about 30 times full-year 08 earnings,' he said.

Body
The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) today posted pre-tax profits of E13.7m for 2006, up 2.3pc on the previous year.
It said turnover rose by 5.2pc during the year to E134.4m, up from E127.7m in 2005.
The IAA is a commercial semi-state body responsible for the provision of air traffic control services in Irish-
controlled airspace.
 Its revenue primarily comes from charging aircraft that use Irish airspace, the majority of which do not land at Irish 
airports, but instead transit through Irish airspace between Europe and North America. The amount of traffic coming 
in to land at Irish airports grew by 4pc in 2006 to 251,235, the IAA said. Traffic into Dublin increased by 5.3pc on 
2005 to 181,220 aircraft movements, while Shannon was up 3.6pc to 35,590 and Cork rose by 3.3pc to 34,425 
movements. The body said North Atlantic traffic rose by 5.4pc to 391,273 movements during the year on the back 
of a weaker dollar and increased competition amongst air carriers. These are aircraft which fly over Irish-controlled 
airspace en route between Europe and North America and do not touch down at Irish airports. In October 2006 the 
IAA took full control of a new block of airspace known as the North Oceanic Transition Area (NOTA), comprising 
95,000 square kilometres, located to the North West of Ireland. This substantially increased the IAA share of air 
traffic transiting between Europe and North America to 379,791 movements, or an average of 1,040 aircraft every 
day. The Irish aircraft register and numbers continue to grow with a total of 1,046 aircraft on the register in 2006, up 
from 877 in 2005. In particular, heavy commercial aircraft rose from 341 in 2005 to 433 in 2006. Currently, the main 
carriers are Ryanair (135 aircraft), Aer Lingus (36 aircraft), CityJet (25 aircraft), Aer Arann (14 aircraft) and Air 
Contractors (20 aircraft). Aircraft on leases accounted for 201 aircraft. Helicopters also showed growth with 140 on 
the register at the end of 2006 compared with 56 in 2000.

Highlight: Shares in FBD Holdings soared by more than 5pc today
Body
Shares in FBD Holdings soared by almost 6pc today after the insurance group confirmed last night that 
shareholders will share a E177m pay-back from the firm's reserves.
The deal will see shareholders receive over E5 per share as FBD reaffirms its commitment to maximise shareholder 
value. 
The company had previously indicated that it would return capital to shareholders if it failed to find suitable avenues 
in which to reinvest the money. The money will be paid on June 27 to those shareholders registered as of June 8.
 The market reacted positively to the news, with shares in FBD closing 223c higher at 40.25. However, those 
impressive gains failed to lift the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares falling 66.72 points to 9,632.81. 
Sharp falls in construction and financial shares were the main reason for the drop. CRH was the biggest faller in the 
building sector, down 22c to 32.18, while Grafton slipped 18c to 32.18 and Kingspan shed 13c to end the session at 
20.97. McInerney tacked on 1c to 15.16. The banks also turned in a sluggish performance. Bank of Ireland and AIB 
both slipped 23c to 16.40 and 22.12 respectively, while Anglo Irish lost 22c to 16.37. Irish Life and Permanent fell 
30c to 21.22. Independent News and Media was another notable faller, down 4pc, or 14c, 3.53. The newspaper 
publisher this week upped its offer for Australian publishing group APN from AUD6.10 per share to AUD6.20 per 
share. IN and M has teamed-up with private equity groups Providence Equity Partners and Carlyle Group to make 
the bid. The consortium said the latest bid will be their final offer. Elsewhere, Paddy Power was in the red, down 
33c to 20.63, on profit taking following its recent strong run. The bookmaker last month posted a 52pc rise in pre-tax 
profits for 2006. No frills airline Ryanair was down 5c to 6.12, while Aer Lingus fell 2c to 3.12 and drinks group C 
and C fell 15c to 12.32. Donegal Creameries was lower again, down 25c to 6.80, as it prepares to publish its full 
year results on Friday. Meanwhile, shares in pharmaceutical group Elan were down 1c to 10.95 as the market 
awaits the release of the company's first quarter results on Tuesday. Goodbody is forecasting a fully diluted loss per 
share of 12c per share from revenue of USD170.5m. Investors will be particularly keen to see how sales of its

multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri are progressing. "We have pencilled in total worldwide Q1 Tysabri sales of 
USD46.7m," Goodbody analyst Ian Hunter said. "Under our current model, to allow for a ramp up of sales to a full 
year total of USD468.8m, we are looking for around 8,100 patients to have been on the drug by the end of March, 
rising to 9,800 by the end of April." The other driver for the stock, at present, is the progress of AAB-001 for the 
treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. A second interim look at the Phase II data is due in "mid" 2007.

How far can budget airlines go? This is no longer just a metaphorical question, with the UK subsidiary of Zoom 
Airlines and Ryanair both working on transatlantic services.
Budget airlines' shareholders need not reach for the sick-bag yet. EasyJet, for one, has said it prefers to 
concentrate on building on its own successful model in Europe. Even Ryanair's Michael O'Leary concedes it would 
be madness to lump short-haul and long-haul operations together.
The sceptical view is that the elements that have made the short-haul model so successful - rapid turnrounds, 
cheap airports, limited legroom - are diluted the further you fly your fleet. That will put pressure on new services to 
cut costs by operating more efficient aircraft - such as Boeing's forthcoming, but heavily demanded, 787 - to ever 
more remote airfields. Of course, they used to scoff that visitors to Vienna would never disembark in Bratislava - 
and Mr O'Leary pulled that off.
But transatlantic economy fares are already cheap because existing carriers subsidise them with profit earnt from 
business passengers. That should give them the ability to fight back against budget competition - always assuming 
that passengers themselves don't demand a profit-threatening discount for flying for seven hours in the back row 
with BudgetAir Atlantic.

From Mr David Pincott.
Sir, I was interested to read that Ryanair will be chucking us across the Atlantic on a no-frills basis soon ("Ryanair 
set to launch low-fare flights to US within four years", April 10), but more interested to see that your correspondent 
described it as "Europe's leading low-cost airline".
As a spin-doctor-type person I have always encouraged others in my trade not to use words universally hated by 
journalists in press releases, such as "leverage" (virtually compulsory in every US press release), "revolutionise" 
and "leading", the latter two on the basis that press releases and editorial are not advertisements. On the basis of 
fairness, can we now expect to see Network Rail described as "Britain's leading network infrastructure operator", 
British Gas as "Britain's leading gas people" or the Institute of Directors as "leading leaders" ?

Body
The Dublin market ended a volatile session largely unchanged today thanks to a strong opening on Wall Street.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the day 3.51 points lower at 9,699.53, well off session lows.
Financial and construction shares had weighed heavy on the market, however, sentiment was given a lift by news 
that the Dow Jones was close to record highs. U.S. investors were buoyed by a rise in home construction data, 
while mild consumer inflation eased fears over the health of the overall economy.
 Back in Dublin, CRH was the main drag on the market after it said its public tender offer for Swiss peer Getaz 
Romang had been successful and that is now in control of 96.79pc of the company's share capital. In accordance 
with the Swiss takeover rules, the offer will be reopened for a further ten trading days to allow shareholders who 
have not yet accepted the offer to do so. Completion of the offer, which is subject to certain conditions, is expected 
on 18 May 2007. Elsewhere in the construction sector, Kingspan was down 5c to 21.10, while Grafton edged up 2c 
to 11.55 and McInerney added on 1c to 15.15. In the financial sector shares in AIB were unchanged on 22.35 after 
M&T Bank, the US bank in which it has a shareholding of just under 25pc, posted a 13pc slump in profits during the 
first quarter. The New York-based bank said this was due to weak demand for mortgages. Net income at M and T 
fell to USD176 million, or USD1.57 per share, from USD203 million, or USD1.77 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on 
average expected profit of USD1.57 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Meanwhile, Shares in Bank of 
Ireland slipped into the red, down 7c to 16.63, while Anglo Irish closed 1c lower at 16.59 and Irish Life and 
Permanent shed 8c to 21.52. Irish Continental Group was one of few shares to make any decent progress, climbing 
10c to 20.80. The Irish Ferries owner confirmed today that the consortium comprising Doyle Group and One Fifty 
One Capital now holds 5,015,330 units in the company, representing 21.33pc. The company said that the 
consortium had begun due diligence after entering into a formal offer process with the company. The due diligence 
is expected to take up to four weeks to complete. Earlier this month, ICG had said it was in talks with the

consortium regarding a possible offer for ICG of not less than E20 a share. Other notable movers included 
scaffolding and fencing firm Siteserv, up 4c to 1.01, no-frills airline Ryanair, up 9c to 6.17, drinks group C and C, 
down 7c t o12.47, and paper firm Smurfit Kappa, up 48c to 19.63. Elsewhere, food group Kerry tacked on 30c to 
22.75, while support services group DCC jumped 15c to 26.45. Shares in Donegal Creameries fell over 3pc, or 25c,

When he steps down as Ryanair chief executive in three years' time, Michael O'Leary's parting gift to shareholders 
of the business he has turned into Europe's leading low-cost carrier will be a transatlantic no-frills airline.As we 
revealed last week on flightglobal.com, the venture, which Ryanair will launch at the turn of the decade, will be a 
budget airline with a difference - a no-frills service offering one-way fares from $12, but with a premium cabin for 
business travellers. It will be run independently of Ryanair - with a separate name and management - and connect 
the airline's 23 European bases with half a dozen secondary airports in the USA.O'Leary rules himself out as the 
venture's chief executive - he says he is too identified with the cost-paring Ryanair to market an airline pitched 
partly at business executives. But the company's track record means the plans are being taken seriously by 
manufacturers, airports and rival airlines.Ryanair will order 40 to 50 of one narrowbody type, and - although the 
services will not interline with Ryanair's European network - the company will tap into the markets around its 23 
bases and the 70 million passengers it plans to be carrying by 2009."It will be relatively straightforward for us to do 
a deal for 40 to 50 long-haul aircraft and connect these European bases transatlantically, and there would be no-
one to touch us," vowed O'Leary, who has a reputation as the most outspoken airline boss, speaking to Flight 
International at the airline's Dublin head office last week.So can Ryanair succeed when others, including most 
famously Freddie Laker's Skytrain service, have failed (see box below)? O'Leary has dismissed the idea of Ryanair 
entering the long-haul market in the past. 
But the introduction of open skies has changed his mind (see box right). The agreement will give Ryanair carte 
blanche to deal directly with US airports and cities keen to lure tourists and business people. O'Leary says he is 
"already receiving offers from US airports".Although Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst with ABN-AMRO, suggests 
O'Leary's proposals may be "mischief-making" timed to coincide with an imminent competition policy ruling into its 
bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus, he says such a venture would be "negative news for network carriers, with hubbing 
carriers Air France and Lufthansa most obviously threatened".He adds: "Network airlines have high overheads, 
restricted working practices and high social costs. New start-up carriers can benefit from substantial labour and 
overhead cost advantages and point-to-point operations simplify things." As with Ryanair's European services, 
O'Leary expects ancillary sales to be a big economy-class revenue earner. "With movies, food and drink, duty-free 
and merchandising, we could make an average of $50 per passenger," he says.Crucial to Ryanair's plans is 
acquiring aircraft "during the downturn". Ryanair is an all-Boeing 737 operator and struck mouth-watering deals with 
Ryanair sets out long-haul plans
Seattle after 9/11. O'Leary expects prices to drop soon after the current orders surge. However, Lobbenberg has 
doubts about O'Leary's ability to acquire the aircraft he needs. "Notwithstanding his clout with Boeing, it is not clear 
how easy it will be to source 787s at the turn of the decade, let alone A350s since they don't get delivered until 
2014," he says.O'Leary revealed his plans after Canadian carrier Zoom Airlines said it would launch a low-fare 
service between London and New York in June. Several all-business class airlines, including Eos, Maxjet and 
Silverjet, have also entered the market in recent years.The plans are unconnected to Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus. 
While Ryanair has promised to retain its rival Irish operator's Airbus A330-based long-haul operation, it says its 
focus would be on "significantly reducing the costs and fares of its short-haul operations".

Ryanair operational flight data monitoring shows the airline has eliminated unstabilised approaches after a run of 
four high-risk incidents between July 2005 and June 2006. The rushed approaches to airports at Rome Ciampino, 
Italy, Stockholm Skavsta, Sweden, and two Irish airports, Cork and Knock, were all the subject of investigations, but 
revised crew standard operating procedures and an awareness campaign appear to have stopped this type of 
occurrence, the airline reports. Ryanair's chief pilot Capt Ray Conway says a series of internal measures has 
resulted in a dramatic decline in rushed approaches. The carrier's operational flight data monitoring (OFDM) system 
has recorded no unstabilised approaches since a warning from the airline's board on 25 September last year. 
The board, worried by details emerging from the incident investigations, issued an unprecedented warning in a 
letter to pilots saying that crews who failed to go around if the aircraft was not fully stabilised as the aircraft passed 
500ft (152m) on final approach would face demotion at the first event and dismissal on the second. The letter also 
reminded pilots that go-arounds were considered a "no-blame" decision, and exceptional circumstances such as 
turbulence, windshear or technical problems would be taken into account.The letter was not the only measure 
employed, Conway says, although the OFDM graph of approach incidents dived to zero immediately it was issued 
and has not risen again. The standard operating procedure (SOP) requiring stabilisation by 500ft has also been 
simplified: now, if the aircraft is not within defined speed and profile parameters at 500ft as monitored by the pilot 
not flying, the pilot not flying is to call "500ft go around". The measure, says Conway, was adopted because of 
recognition that, in some incidents, the misjudgement by the pilot flying had been caused by "task saturation", 
making the pilot "less able to judge the situation critically".OFDM has had a generally beneficial effect on operations 
quality assurance at Ryanair since it was adopted fleet-wide in May 2004, says Conway. He uses downloads from 
OFDM in safety "roadshows" each year at Ryanair's bases, and at these he takes de-identified examples of recent 
occurrences in which "exceedences" beyond SOP parameters have occurred and runs cockpit simulations of them 
for the pilots to discuss. They are popular with pilots, he says, pointing out that in the past 12 months 1,100 of 
Ryanair's 1,375 flightcrew attended a safety roadshow.

Freddie Laker tried it with Skytrain (1977-82) and failed. So did PEOPLExpress in the 1980s. Why should anyone 
else - Michael O'Leary, for example - succeed in making low-cost, no-frills scheduled transatlantic services work 
when companies like that couldn't?
That that was then and this is now. Then Laker had to fight governments and get laws changed to be allowed on to 
the North Atlantic, before facing a recession just after buying 10 McDonnell Douglas DC-10s for dollars when the 
pound was rock bottom against the US dollar and interest rates were high.PEOPLExpress was an amazing outfit 
while it remained a relatively small, simple domestic carrier in the USA. Its troubles began when it started growing 
fast and getting transatlantic ambitions big time - meaning it acquired Boeing 747s. And, of course, secondary 
airports were not allowed to be international gateways then.Now the European/US "open skies" deal has cleared 
almost all the artificial barriers to entry. When/if O'Leary decides the time has come for a transatlantic no-frills 
venture he will not make the same mistakes. But what would his relationship be with an airline that could draw on 
Ryanair synergies by sharing bases while not sharing its name, directors, employees or aeroplanes? If O'Leary 
holds shares, would he be able to resist heading the carrier?See Headlines P6

Shares in AIB soared by more than 3pc today after it announced it is to raise between E100m and E150m to buy 
property in Poland.
AIB Capital Markets said the capital raised will be leveraged to provide a fund worth around E600m for investment

 Shares are had traded modestly higher for virtually all of the day and were further boosted by a strong opening on

shares also moved higher. Bank of Ireland jumped 32c to 16.70, while Anglo Irish added on 40c to 16.60 and Irish 
Life and Permanent tacked on 10c to 21.60. Construction shares were mixed. Kingspan closed 5c lower at 21.15, 
while Grafton added on 4c to 11.53 and McInerney jumped 3c to 15.14. Shares in CRH slumped 41c to 32.79 after 
the building materials group today confirmed its first investment in Turkey and another deal in the US. CRH has 
acquired 50pc of Turkish firm Denizli Cement and has also exercised an option to buy out the remaining 50pc stake 
in Florida-based Paver Systems. The two deals are valued at E225m and "underline the ongoing appetite within 
CRH to continue an active acquisition programme," Davy analyst Joe Gill said. He predicts that both deals will add 
about 0.5pc to earnings per share in a full year. Other notable movers included drinks group C and C, up 32c to 
12.54, as the recent spell of good weather continues. Meanwhile, former state airline Aer Lingus eased up 2c to 
3.14, while Ryanair added on 8c to 6.08 and pharmaceutical group Elan jumped 4c to 10.86. Meanwhile, shares in 
ISEQ closes up as shares in AIB soar 3pc
property services company Veris ended the session over 5pc higher, or up 5c, at 4.15. Shares moved upwards after 
UK-based property group company Erinaceous Group, which competes with Veris in both the Irish and UK markets, 
announced that it had "received preliminary approaches which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the 
company". The identity of the bidder was not disclosed. Goodbody said a deal "would mark the latest chapter in the 
ongoing consolidation of the Facilities Management and Property Management sectors in both countries. "Veris has 
played an active role in this process, purchasing a total of seven companies in two separate deals since its IPO in 
September 2005," Goodbody's Phillip O'Sullivan said. Veris, which was formerly known as Irish Estates, last month 
posted a 77pc rise in pre-tax profits to E2.7 million.

Low-cost airlines set to tackle long-haul carriers
Low-cost airlines set to tackle long-haul carriers

Long-haul network airlines are being challenged in unprecedented fashion by new aviation business models.
An upstart breed of low-cost carriers has made inroads into the traditional airlines' short-haul markets, capturing a 
growing share and forcing legacy carriers to restructure their operationsdrastically to survive.
In the long-haul sector the attack has taken longer tomaterialise, but challengers are stepping forward. It is a 
development that could drive the aviation industry into an era of wrenching change.
The gauntlet has been thrown down first in the business-class segment, where legacy carriers make the lion's 
share of profits.
Eos Airlines and Maxjet began flying 18 months ago in the London-New York market. They have been followed this 
year by Silverjet, a UK start-up on the route, and L'Avion, which flies between Paris and New York.
The London-New York route is the test bed for the latest aviation experiments, because it is the world's busiest and 
most lucrative long-haul market with more than 4m passengers a year.
For several years, airlines have shied away from trying to make the low-cost business model work on long-haul 
routes.
Analysts have argued thatpassengers need costly in-flight service "frills" for routes that take many hours. And some 
of the key operating factors in the short-haul model, such as quick airport turnrounds, are much tougher to achieve 
in long-haul. Equally, bargain basement fares are already available from the legacy carriers themselves.
Conventional wisdom is set to be challenged, however, notably by two of the world's most successful low-cost 
aviation entrepreneurs - Tony Fernandes, chief executive of Malaysia's Air Asia, and Michael O'Leary, chief 
executive of Ireland's Ryanair.
Mr O'Leary says his transatlantic assault could be launched in three to four years. Mr Fernandes hopes his AirAsia 
X could take off this year.
Low-cost airlines set to tackle long-haul carriers
Both entrepreneurs insist they will set up separate companies to run the budget long-haul operations. Mr O'Leary 
said last week: "The minute you put a long-haul business on top of a short-haul operation, you kill it."
There is still scepticism that economy long-haul carriers can be viable, however.
Lawrence Hunt, founder ofSilverjet, said: "Long-haul already has budget fares - Pounds 18 per passenger per hour 
is already the average of the lowest (transatlantic) economy fares, which is slightly lower than Ryanair's average on 
short-haul routesin Europe.
"If he is going to be offering Pounds 7 seats, he is going to be offering Pounds 7 service, which is untenable on 
long-haul flights lasting several hours."

Shares in Aer Lingus slipped back today amid speculation that the European Commission could make Ryanair sell 
some or even all of its stake in the flag carrier.
Reports suggest that if Brussels block Ryanair's plans to takeover Aer Lingus it already has the legal groundwork in 
place to force the sale. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 2c to 3.12 on the news, while Ryanair ended the session 1c lower 
at 6.00.
However, modest gains elsewhere were enough to lift the overall ISEQ index of Irish shares. The Dublin market 
closed 47.99 points higher at 9,600.87.
 Trading early on had been sluggish, however, the market was given a lift in the afternoon by a steady start on Wall 
Street. Financial shares were the main catalyst for those gains, with AIB up 17c to 21.67 and Bank of Ireland up 26c 
to 16.38. Elsewhere in the sector, Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 1c to 16.20, while Irish Life and Permanent soared 
44c to 21.49. In the construction sector shares were divided with CRH slumping 40c to 33.20 on profit taking 
following sharp gains in the previous session. Grafton and McInerney also slipped into the red, down 1c to 11.49 
and 4c to 15.11. AGI Therapeutics had a particularly strong session, rising over 5pc, or 10c, to 1.90, presumably on 
the news this week that it has received FDA approval to file for Phase III testing of its new Irritable Bowel Syndrome 
drug. On Wednesday the gastrointestinal drug products company announced net losses of E4.3m for 2006. Other 
notable movers included paper-based packaging firm Smurfit Kappa, up 47c to 18.90, pharmaceutical group Elan, 
up 24c to 10.82, and food group Kerry, up 22c to 22.40. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power was up 31c to 20.86 
after it this week confirmed a deal to sponsor Eircom League side St Patrick's Athletic over the next four years. 
Drinks group C&C climbed 15c to 12.22. Among the fallers, recruitment group CPL Resources slipped 5c to 8.00, 
while clinical research group ICON dropped 40c to 32.60. Meanwhile, Irish Continental Group added on 5c to 20.80 
after it was confirmed that the One51/Doyle Group consortium had raised its stake in the Irish Ferries operator to 
over 20pc. The duo are planning to make a takeover bid for ICG. Both companies bought shares yesterday at a 
ISEQ closes up despite dip in airlines
price of E20.75. This means that any offer they make will have to be at least at this level. They had previously said 
that any offer would be made at E20 per share. Across the Atlantic, stocks on Wall Street waffled early on as a slide 
in consumer confidence heightened investor concerns about the economy but the government's wholesale inflation 
report eased some fears of higher interest rates. However, analysts said investors remain hesitant about making big 
moves ahead of next week's spate of first-quarter financial results, which they are anticipating will indicate slowing 
corporate growth. The Dow Jones industrial average has shown gains in nine of the last 10 sessions, and a 
disappointing earnings season could reverse that upward trend.

Ryanair is being sued for E2m by Spanish rivals Iberia over a bungled publicity stunt.
The budget airline promised free flight vouchers to anyone who turned up at Barcelona's Plaza de Catalunya with 
placards criticising the Spanish airline.
Thousands arrived but the crowd turned hostile when the 500 vouchers Ryanair had printed ran out.
 Yesterday, Sinead Finn, Ryanair's head of sales and marketing for Europe, slammed the legal moves as "absurd". 
She said it was "Iberia's final tactic to keep protecting its control of the Spanish market. "They are trying to block 
competition in Spain. They are scared of the competition." She said it was not Ryanair who wrote the placards 
criticising Iberia but the "Spanish consumers". A source at Iberia confirmed the lawsuit had been filed. He added: "It 
has nothing to do with being scared. It has everything to do with competition airlines acting within the law." The 
Catalan Consumer Affairs Agency began an investigation into last September's Ryanair stunt after receiving more 
than 150 complaints. Finn had to be rushed into a police station by armed officers for her own protection after being 
surrounded by the angry mob. Staff at Ryanair's Spanish PR company, Ulled, frantically handed out photocopies of 
vouchers in a vain attempt to placate them.

The European Commission could force Ryanair to sell some or all of its 25pc stake in Aer Lingus if Brussels 
decides to veto its takeover bid, the Reuters news agency reports. 
Reuters, quoting a confidential charge sheet, says the Commission has already "laid the legal groundwork" to force 
the sale.
"People familiar with the statement of objections (SO) say it concludes that low-cost Ryanair would lock up the Irish 
air market if it acquired the partly state-owned peer, leading to higher prices for travellers," the agency reports.
 The commission is due to deliver is verdict on the E1.48bn bid by June 13. Speaking to Businessworld yesterday, 
Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said it would be "extraordinary" if the EU blocked its plans to buy Aer 
Lingus as other large European airlines have recently merged. O'Leary claims this would constitute "one rule flag 
carriers trying to merge and another for low cost carriers". He pointed to the merger of Air France and KLM in 2004 
as an example of how two large European airlines had been allowed to come together. Ryanair would likely appeal 
such a decision in the European Appeal Court, but would it would not look to sell its 25pc stake, he added.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, will launch low-fare transatlantic services within four years - a move that 
could pose a serious competitive threat to the established European and US long-haul carriers.
Ryanair said such an operation would be run separately from its European short-haul business but would fly from 
some of its existing European bases to secondary airports in the US.
The launch of such a venture has been made possible by the recent "open skies" accord between the US and the 
European Union to liberalise trans- atlantic air services.
The treaty will come into operation from March 31 2008 and will for the first time enable an EU airline to fly from any 
point in the EU to any point in the US.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, revealed his plan to aviation magazine Flight International, one day after 
the UK subsidiary of Zoom Airlines, a small Canadian carrier, announced the June launch of the first low-fare long-
haul service between London and New York. One-way fares will start from Pounds 129 including taxes and 
charges.
Several low-cost short-haul airlines are also making moves into long-haul markets includingVirgin Blue in Australia, 
which is planning transpacific services to the US. Malaysia's Air Asia is planning AirAsia X, a separate long-haul 
carrier, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Europe, China and the US, while Germany's Air Berlin is venturing into long-
haul via its recent acquisition of German charter carrier LTU.
Oasis Hong Kong Airlines began low-fare flights between Hong Kong and London last October and is adding trans-
pacific services this year.
The potential shake-up of the budget end of long-haul follows parallel moves to transform the business-class sector 
in the past two years, with the pioneering launch of several start-up all-business-class carriers across the North 
Atlantic led by EosAirlines, Maxjet and Silverjet.
Ryanair set to launch low-fare flights to US within four years
EasyJet, Ryanair's leading European rival, yesterday ruled out a move into long-haul operations. "We are 
completely committed to the short-haul, point-to-point low-cost model," said Toby Nicol, communications director.
Mr O'Leary said transatlantic fares could start from as little as Euros 10 one way. The new airline would have a 
"premium class" cabin. However, Mr Nicol said that "the sort of fares being talked of are cloud cuckoo land. You 
cannot even fly Ryanair in Europe for Euros 10."

Financial shares were back in positive territory today as the Dublin market recovered from yesterday's falls.
Just after 1300, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 21.74 points to 9,574.62.
The index was hit yesterday by strong hints from the European Central Bank that it will raise interest rates in June 
and by new figures which showed that inflation in Ireland increased to 5.1pc in March, up from 4.8pc in February. 
Financial and construction shares were hit hardest by the news.
 The banking sector managed a modest recovery today, with AIB jumping 18c to 21.68, Bank of Ireland up 12c to 
16.24 and Irish Life and Permanent up 5c to 21.10. However, trading amongst building stocks remained sluggish 
with just Kingspan making any headway, climbing 19c to 21.23. Other notable movers today included AGI

The European Commission said it is 'premature' to comment on its in-depth inquiry into low-cost air carrier 
Ryanair's proposed merger with Aer Lingus.
'This merger has been notified to the European Commission. The Commission has started an in-depth investigation 
and has set a deadline of 13th June for taking a final decision. So any comments at this stage, on both (sides), are 
completely premature,' a spokeswoman said.
The response comes a day after reports cited Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary as saying he expects EU 
regulators to block the merger, but remains willing to challenge such a ruling in the courts.
 Ryanair withdrew its E1.48 billion hostile takeover bid in December last year after the commission launched an in-
depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines. 
Ryanair built up a 25.2pc stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid. The deal has faced oppositions from other 
shareholders - including the Government - and unions.

Budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC is considering launching a separate airline that would fly long-haul between 
Europe and the United States around the turn of the decade.
Ryanair on Thursday confirmed comments made in an interview by Chief Executive Michael O'Leary that he has 
already had speculative approaches from U.S. airports about setting up a service.
More competition is expected on trans-Atlantic routes after the European Union approved an aviation deal with the 
United States last month to open up the restricted routes to new rivals.
The "Open Skies" deal, which takes effect from the end of March 2008, will allow airlines to fly from anywhere in the 
EU to any point in the U.S., shedding limitations that also discourage them from charging what they like or 
combining with other carriers.
O'Leary told trade magazine Flight International that the new airline could fly to five or six U.S. cities from European 
bases and offer one-way fares as low as $12US (€8.94). It would serve secondary U.S. airports such as Baltimore 
and Providence in Rhode Island and would also have "premium class" seating.
"By mid-2009, we will be carrying 70 million passengers at 23 bases across Europe," he told the magazine. "It will 
be relatively straightforward for us to do a deal for 40 to 50 long-haul aircraft and connect these bases trans-
Atlantically."
Ryanair is not the only airline to speculate on joining the trans-Atlantic route to the U.S. Zoom Airlines Ltd., the U.K. 
unit of Canada's Zoom Airlines Inc., said separately it plans to start what it describes as low-cost flights between 
London's Gatwick Airport and New York beginning June 21.
Zoom airline said one-way fares will start from 129 pounds ($254US.90; €189.90) including taxes and charges. It 
will offer economy and premium economy services with designated seating and a meals service.

Shares in the Dublin market were slightly down this lunchtime on sharp falls from Paddy Power and Kerry Group. 
At midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 31 points at 9526.20. 
Financial shares put in a mixed performance. Bank of Ireland fell 3c to 16.17 and AIB dropped 3c to 21.61. Anglo 
Irish Bank rose 9c to 16.09 and Irish Life and Permanent jumped 8c to 21.08.

division of Budelpack International, based in Hamont, Northern Belgium. According to Jack Gorman, analyst at 
Davy Stockbrokers, "United Drug's latest acquisition is more significant in strategic rather than financial terms. Its 
first deal in continental Europe opens a new bridgehead for expansion - ideally suited to the asset-backed nature of 
the specialist packaging segment."

Highlight: Ryanair has flown a plane full of journalists around Europe today to show them the kind of terminals it 
likes.
Body
Ryanair today took its campaign against DAA plans to spend hundreds of million of euro on the new second 
terminal at Dublin Airport to new heights.
The airline flew a group of journalists to two airports in Germany to show them cheaper ways of building new 
terminals.
They were shown plans for a new terminal at Frankfurt Kahn Airport which will accomodate 15 million passengers 
and cost just E50m.
 The new terminal proposed by the DAA in Dublin would accomodate the same number, but cost up to 20 times as 
much, Ryanair says. The DAA has claimed that the new terminal will cost E609m, however, O'Leary says the actual 
bill will rise is E842m once the redundancy cost of the airport's Pier C is taken into consideration. Ryanair Chief 
Executive, Michael O'Leary, remains vehemenently opposed to what he calls"gold-plated" plans for the airport 
extension and has urged the DAA to "go back to the drawing board". O'Leary told reporters on the flight that the 
DAA's plans are "grossly inefficient" and "a waste of hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers money". He called on 
An Bord Pleanala to overturn the planning permission already granted by Fingal County Council on the basis that 
the terminal facility not only fails to comply with the Local Area Plan but it is also a further example of very poor 
planning by the DAA. Meanwhile, Mr O'Leary said it would be "extraordinary" if the European Commission blocked 
its plans to buy Aer Lingus as other large European airlines have recently merged. The EU is widely tipped to reject 
any possible merger between Ireland's two biggest airlines, however, O'Leary claims this would constitute "one rule 
flag carriers trying to merge and another for low cost carriers". Ryanair would likely appeal such a decision in the 
European Appeal Court, but would it would not look to sell its 25pc stake, he added.

Zoom to launch low-cost flights to New York

The first low fare transatlantic service since Freddie Laker's ill-fated Skytrain in the late 1970s is being planned by 
Hugh and John Boyle, the Scottish travel entrepreneurs.
Zoom Airlines will operate flights between London and New York, offering one-way fares starting from Pounds 129.
The brothers, veterans of the UK travel sector, launched the airline as a Canadian carrier based in Ottawa in 2002, 
and have focused to date largelyon developing leisure routes between Britain and Can-ada.
Subject to receiving licences from the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport, Zoom plans to start 
daily flights from June 21 between London Gatwick and New York JFK airports.
Existing transatlantic airlines are already facing new rivals in their most lucrative business class cabins with the 
launch in the last two years of several all-business class carriers between London and New York led by Eos 
Airlines, Maxjet and Silverjet.
Zoom is aiming to compete against the established carriers by undercutting their economy prices and removing 
restrictions, such as the need for staying over a Saturday night, which are needed to buy most of the lowest fares 
currently offered.
Such restrictions also used to be commonplace in Europe to gain the cheapest fares on short-haul flights, but the 
revolution in short-haul flying led by low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet have long since forced the 
traditional carriers to back down.

Body
No-frills Irish airline, Ryanair, plans to offer cut-price flights to US cities by 2011, its chief executive, Michael 
O'Leary said.
It will take advantage of the recently agreed open-skies deal between Europe and the US launching a transatlantic 
service "by the turn of the decade", Mr O'Leary said.
The airline will serve five or six destinations through secondary airports, such as Long Island in New York, Rhode 
Island in New England and Baltimore. Mr O'Leary said he expects the cheapest fare to be USD12 (E10) for US 
passengers flying to Europe.
 Several US airports have already approached the carrier about the plan, he said. The service will be run by a 
separate company with its own board of management but still under the control and ownership of Ryanair, he 
added.

Body
Ryanair has flown a group of journalists to airports in Germany to point out what it maintains is a far cheaper way of 
building new terminals than currently being undertaken by the Dublin Airport Authority.
Ryanair claims Frankfurt-Hann Airport and Bremen Airport in Germany proves that a terminal can be built for less 
than one-tenth of the cost of the one planned by the DAA.
Ryanair said it remains opposed to current "gold-plated" plans for the second terminal at Dublin airport.
 The airline said the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is "wasting money" by spending E609 million on the new 
terminal, when similar passenger facilities - such as the ones pointed out to journalists in Germany today - are far 
cheaper. The budget carrier also claims that current plans will lead to passenger charges doubling at Dublin Airport 
from E5.50 currently to around E11.

Body
The news that United Drug had made its first foray into continental Europe sent shares in the healthcare and 
pharmaceutical distributor soaring by more than 3pc today.
The company confirmed the acquisition of the pharma and healthcare packaging unit of Belgium-based Budelpack 
International, sending shares 13c higher to 4.05.
Those gains helped the overall ISEQ index of Irish shares up 26.17 points to 9,557.89.
 Financial shares also moved tentatively higher in the run-up to the European Central Bank's interest rate decision 
tomorrow. AIB added on 14c to 21.24, while Bank of Ireland jumped 17c to 16.22 and Irish Life and Permanent 
climbed 12c to 21.07. Anglo Irish Bank ended the session 12c higher at 15.96. The ECB is all but certain to keep 
rates unchanged at its meeting in Frankfurt, but is likely to confirm that it is on course for a further rate hike in the 
months ahead, economists said. The next rate hike is most likely to come in June, but a May tightening move is not 
completely ruled out, they said. The ECB raised its main refinancing rate to 3.75pc from 3.50pc at its last monetary 
policy meeting on March 8, the seventh quarter point rise in rates since the start of the current tightening cycle in 
Dec 2005. The ECB has never moved rates at two consecutive meetings, so there is unlikely to be any serious 
consideration of a move this week, economists said. ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet''s language at the March 8 
meeting suggests that rates are now near their peak. Trichet described rates as "moderate" after the March move, 
whereas he had previously described them as "low". In the construction sector, shares in CRH were up 20c to 
33.49, while Grafton moved up 5c to 11.67 and Kingspan tacked on 18c to 20.88. McInerney was also in the black, 
up 7c to 15.24. Other notable movers included diagnostics firm Trinity Biotech, up 11c to 1.81, no-frills airline 
Ryanair, up 5c to 6.06, and food group Kerry, up 39c to 22.36. IONA Technologies also made good progress after it 
announced the purchase of US technology firm Logicblaze for an undisclosed sum on Tuesday. It said the deal 
would earn it cash within 12 months. Shares in the software company soared by over 7pc early in the session, 
before settling at 4.40, up 20c on the day. Elsewhere, shares in IAWS were up 29c to 18.00 after Swiss foodstuffs 
ISEQ closes higher as United Drug soars
maker Hiestand, in which IAWS owns a 33pc stake, this week reported a 14.8pc rise in sales to E315m profits of 
E51.8m for 2006. Goodbody said the results were in line with its expectations. The firm said that the strong 
momentum had continued into the opening months of this year, with sales up 46.4pc in the first quarter. Meanwhile, 
DCC was a notable faller, down 22c to 26.33, amid reports that offers for housebuilding firm Manor Park, in which 
DCC owns a 49pc stake, are below the mooted E700m-E750m price range. Seven parties are believed to have 
submitted bids for the company, with the highest offer believed to be over E600m. Every E50m that Manor Park is 
sold for is worth 24c per share to DCC, according to Davy Stockbrokers. The business support services group is 
due to release its full year results around the middle of May, with analysts forecasting double digit divisional profit 
growth during the second half of the year.

Body
Ryanair has accused Spanish airline Iberia of blocking competition in its core Spanish market after the carrier filed a 
E2m suit against the Irish no frills airline following a Barcelona publicity campaign.
In a statement, Ryanair dismissed the action as 'Iberia's latest tactic to contribute to protect its dominance in the 
Spanish market.'
Ryanair added it expects to continue growing in Spain regardless and sees itself transporting E9m passengers to 
and from Spanish destinations in 2007.
 Iberia's suit, filed with a Madrid trade court, follows a publicity stunt carried out by Ryanair in September 2006, 
offering free tickets to people who carried placards stating why they would prefer to fly Ryanair over Iberia. 'Ryanair 
did not write the placards, Spanish consumers did, who were clearly expressing their preference for one airline over 
another,' Ryanair said.

Irish Life and Permanent and Independent News and Media were the star performers today as the Dublin market 
returned from the Easter break with a bang.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares soared by more than 1pc, or 113.48 points, to close at 9,531.72.
Shares in Irish Life and Permanent jumped an impressive 71c to 20.95 after it earlier this week confirmed the 
launch of a new low cost personal loans company called Bluecubeloans. The new lender will provide unsecured 
personal loans of up to E35,000 from 7.9pc APR (variable) to customers throughout the Republic of Ireland. The 
new loans channel will operate separately from Permanent TSB and is intended to compliment existing product 
offerings from the group.
 Elsewhere in the financial sector, AIB was also modestly higher, up 26c to 21.46, while Bank of Ireland added on 
15c to 116.15 and Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 3c to close at 15.85. Independent News and Media was another 
notable gainer, climbing 10c to 3.69, following reports at the end of last week that business tycoon Denis O'Brien is 
set to double his stake in company in a move that will cost him over E130 million. Mr O'Brien has placed an order to 
buy 5pc of the group. The Digicel owner already owns 5.06pc of the company led by rival Sir Anthony O'Reilly, 
following two similar raids on the stock early this year and early last year. The latest order of just over 38 million 
shares was placed with Goodbody Stockbrokers at the beginning of last week. In the construction sector, Kingspan 
was the biggest gainer, up 41c to 20.70. Elsewhere, CRH added on 34c to 33.29, while McInerney climbed 19c to 
15.19 and Grafton jumped 29c to 11.62. Other notable movers included food group Kerry, up 3c to 21.50, no frills 
airline Ryanair, up 4cto 6.01, and Irish Continental Group, up 50c to 20.75. Aer Lingus added on 2c to 3.17, 
however, fencing and scaffolding firm Siteserv ended the session 5c lower at 1.01. Meanwhile, shares in 
pharmaceutical group Elan shot up by more than 5pc, or 55c, to 10.90 after it announced a spate of changes to its 
board, while drinks group CandC added on 10c to 11.82 as speculation continued to circulate that it is a takeover 
target for international brewers. The sharp gains in Dublin came despite a lacklustre start on Wall Street as leading

U.S. stocks lacked direction amid an empty economic data calendar. Whether the strong trading continues on this 
side of the Atlantic for the rest of the week will depend on what the European Central Bank has to say about interest 
rates at its meeting on Thursday. The central bank is widely expected to hold its key interest rates steady at 3.75pc, 
but will likely pave the way for further monetary tightening in the coming months, analysts said. Goodbody 
economist, Deirdre Ryan, said "we are likely to be reminded that rates are still 'on the accommodative side', and as 
recent hawkish comments from council members have stressed, the ECB still feels there is more to do".

This weekend - one of the busiest periods on the flying calendar - is likely to see thousands of airline seats standing 
empty, going by the usual numbers of last-minute cancellations or would-be travellers turning up too late for their 
flights.
For airlines, these empty seats can translate into windfalls running into millions of pounds as they pocket 
government taxes and other passenger charges. But passengers who miss a flight, for whatever reason, are being 
advised to reclaim taxes and surcharges on otherwise non-refundable tickets.
The recent doubling of air passenger duty (APD) - or UK departure tax - to Pounds 40 for long-haul economy flights 
has made it all the more worthwhile to claim refunds for these and other extras on unused tickets. Such refunds on 
cancelled or missed flights can be worth as much as Pounds 150 on a transatlantic flight costing as little as Pounds 
200.
"A lot of people do not think to reclaim," says Simon Evans, chief executive of the Air Transport Users Council 
(AUC). "But thousands have successfully claimed and most carriers will refund (at least) government taxes."
The AUC says there is no law requiring airlines to rebate any so-called TFCs - taxes, fees and charges - on non-
refundable tickets. But in practice even the low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet say they will refund both 
air passenger duty and overseas government taxes.
And some traditional airlines will go even further. BA will refund "anything that's separated out of the fare." This 
includes fuel surcharges and passenger service as well as insurance and security charges. "BA has decided that 
passengers should only have to pay these charges if they actually travel," says a spokesperson.
Even so, airlines do not advertise or automatically make these refunds, so non-fliers do need to put in a claim. And 
the real catch is that, in most cases, an administrative charge is also levied, which at worst wipes out any refund or 
Passport to a sunny refund AIRLINE CHARGES: Passengers who miss a flight are entitled to reclaim taxes, 
writes Steve Lodge
makes reclaiming barely worth the bother. "Often the refundable extras will be Pounds 20 but the administrative 
charge will also be Pounds 20," says Evans at the AUC.
For example Ryanair refunds passenger duty and the equivalent overseas departure tax but charges a Pounds 15 
administration fee. On a return domestic flight, with passenger duty of Pounds 10 each way, that refund would 
therefore be worth just Pounds 5. To make matters worse, Ryanair refund seekers also have to send their claims by 
post to its head office in Dublin.
By contrast Easyjet makes no charge for refunding the same government taxes, and on a flight to Morocco this 
would be worth Pounds 40. "You are talking a lot of money now - particularly for families - and a large percentage of 
the ticket price since APD (departure tax) has doubled," says an Easyjet spokeswoman.
The biggest refunds are likely to be had on unused long-haul tickets. BA says that at present as much as Pounds 
157 of TFCs would be refundable on a return from London to Los Angeles, including Pounds 40 passenger duty, a 
Pounds 70 fuel surcharge (Pounds 35 each way) and a Pounds 5 insurance surcharge. The administration fee on 
an e-ticket is Pounds 15, or Pounds 30 for a telephone or postal rebate - costs that would still return more than 
Pounds 100 to someone who did not travel.
Virgin Atlantic said it would not charge any administration fee and refunds could also be worth more than Pounds 
100 on a transatlantic or other long-haul flight.
But there can be other catches to getting refunds. If a ticket is booked through a travel agent rather than direct then 
refunds may have to be applied for through that agent - which at worst could mean two administration fees. Airlines 
may also refuse to pay any refund on return tickets where one part of the journey is taken.
The Consumers Association suggests that high administration fees should be challenged by disappointed refund 
seekers.
If you paid for your flight by credit card (so long as the purchase price was Pounds 100 or more), the card firm may 
be able to offer some help in getting money back, including paying compensation itself.
Some travel agents also point out that regardless of the ability to reclaim TFCs, air travellers should not just assume 
that nothing can be done with a non-refundable ticket. Their advice is to contact the travel agent concerned (or 
airline, if booked directly) as soon as it is known a ticket will not be used. Ryanair and Easyjet allow passengers to 
change their flights for fees of Pounds 25 and Pounds 17.50 respectively, which may make more financial sense 
than simply claiming back the tax.
Alternatively, travel insurance policies could offer financial compensation for unused tickets in some circumstances. 
Travel policies may cover cancellation due to the illness or death of a close relative or one of your party, as well as 
your own illness, redundancy or a domestic disaster. If you miss your flight due to significant transport problems 
getting to the airport, you may also be covered.

C and C led the Dublin market higher today in light trading ahead of the market's four-day closure for the Easter 
weekend.
Shares in the Bulmers cider manufacturer jumped almost 4pc, or 40c to 11.72, as it continues to benefit from recent 
figures which placed its UK cider brand Magners among the top 20 brands in the UK. The recent good weather and 
forecasts for more sunshine over the long holiday weekend also helped lift the share price.
The performance of C&C was similar to that of the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares closing 55.06 
points higher at 9,412.53.
 Investor sentiment was boosted by a strong performance in London where investors breathed a sigh of relief 
following the Bank of England's decision to keep its interest rates unchanged at 5.25pc. Even a mixed performance 
by leading financial shares failed to knock the good feeling on the market floor, with AIB down a sluggish 6c to 
21.20 and Bank of Ireland down 5c to 16.00. Irish Life and Permanent moved slightly higher, up 4c to 20.24, while 
Anglo Irish Bank was the sector's star performer, up 30c to 15.82. In the construction sector, CRH was in the black, 
jumping 44c to 32.95, while Kingspan added on an impressive 44c to close at 20.29. Grafton and McInerney both 
slipped slightly, down 4c to 11.33 and 19c to 15.00, while housebuilder Abbey ended the session 3c lower at 11.55. 
Ryanair was 5c higher at 5.87 after it said on Wednesday that passenger numbers during March were up 26pc on 
the previous year to almost 3.8 million. The passenger growth was 0.5pc ahead of the consensus forecast. The no-
frills airline said its load factor was down 1pc to 78pc during the month, however, this was in line with forecasts as a 
result of new capacity added in recent months. Other notable movers included bookmaker Paddy Power, up 41c to 
21.00, despite reports that Ladbrokes had bought five new outlets in the Roscommon area. Recruitment company

Body
C and C led the Dublin market higher today in light trading ahead of the market's four-day closure for the Easter 
weekend.
Shares in the Bulmers cider manufacturer jumped almost 4pc, or 40c to 11.72, as it continues to benefit from recent 
figures which placed its UK cider brand Magners among the top 20 brands in the UK. The recent good weather and 
forecasts for more sunshine over the long holiday weekend also helped lift the share price.
The performance of C and C was similar to that of the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares closing 
60.77 points higher at 9,418.24.
 Investor sentiment was boosted by a strong performance in London where investors breathed a sigh of relief 
following the Bank of England's decision to keep its interest rates unchanged at 5.25pc. Even a mixed performance 
by leading financial shares failed to knock the good feeling on the market floor, with AIB down a sluggish 6c to 
21.20 and Bank of Ireland down 5c to 16.00. Irish Life and Permanent moved slightly higher, up 4c to 20.24, while 
Anglo Irish Bank was the sector's star performer, up 30c to 15.82. In the construction sector, CRH was in the black, 
jumping 44c to 32.95, while Kingspan added on an impressive 44c to close at 20.29. Grafton and McInerney both 
slipped slightly, down 4c to 11.33 and 19c to 15.00, while housebuilder Abbey ended the session 3c lower at 11.55. 
Ryanair was 5c higher at 5.87 after it said on Wednesday that passenger numbers during March were up 26pc on 
the previous year to almost 3.8 million. The passenger growth was 0.5pc ahead of the consensus forecast. The no-
frills airline said its load factor was down 1pc to 78pc during the month, however, this was in line with forecasts as a 
result of new capacity added in recent months. Other notable movers included bookmaker Paddy Power, up 41c to 
21.00, despite reports that Ladbrokes had bought five new outlets in the Roscommon area. Recruitment company 
CPL Resources made impressive headway, rising 50c to 8.00, while former state airline Aer Lingus slipped 2c to 
3.15. Food group IAWS tacked on 23c to 17.48, pharmaceutical group Elan jumped 13c to 10.35 and Drugs

An unfair cop in this case for BA MUDLARK - CLAY HARRIS
An unfair cop in this case for BA MUDLARK - CLAY HARRIS

Body
Mudlark is not a "fly-the-flag" sort when it comes to choosing airlines, so, therefore, not a particular partisan of 
British Airways.
The corporate arrogance of 20 years ago, especially as manifested in attitudes towards British Caledonian and 
Laker Airways, was compounded by its stingy attitude on frequent-flyer miles except on full fares.
So other airlines were rewarded with loyalty, and habits are hard to break.
But BA's latest bad publicity - as loss-leader for luggage in 2006 European league tables - has a certain injustice 
about it.
Even though most media accounts gave the ranking some context, damning headlines do their damage.
Why do the league tables need to be deconstructed?
The rules by which they are drawn up always put BA at a disadvantage: 2006, from August on, was a year in which 
UK airports - especially Heathrow - had to operate under conditions unlike others in Europe and BA's UK rivals 
either are not members of the Association of European Airlines, the body that compiles the rankings, or refused to 
submit figures.
Blame for lost luggage is attributed by "last-carrier responsibility". A hub-based airline such as BA can end up taking 
the rap for delays caused by short connections on inter-line transfers.
BA says its record for luggage checked in for direct flights is comparable with all other airlines.
New security rules introduced overnight in August also hit BA disproportionately hard. Until then, its 2006 lost- 
luggage figures were in line with the AEA average.
An unfair cop in this case for BA MUDLARK - CLAY HARRIS
But even after the initial shambles of August, curbs on liquids and the UK's strictly enforced limit of one carry-on 
mean that BA is carrying 25 per cent more checked bags than before. More scope for delay or loss, especially on 
transfer.
The European Union's harmonisation in November of rules about carried-on liquids went only so far.
Other European airports - sensibly, in Mudlark's view - still allow more than one carry-on bag. This helps to 
minimise the amount of luggage checked in, and potentially lost or delayed, and avoids John Reid minutes wasted 
at the baggage carrousel. Unless, that is, the passenger is transferring in the UK, where all but one will have to be 
checked in during transfer, and the last carrier becomes responsible.
Anyone swayed by lost-luggage figures, moreover, might want to compare BA's with those of other UK airlines. But 
Ryanair and EasyJet are not AEA members and BMI British Midland and Virgin Atlantic refused to supply theirs.
BA's response has been exemplary, accepting the blame, apologising - again - to passengers, and saying matters 
should improve when Heathrow Terminal 5 opens in March 2008.
If you're flying this weekend, travel light.

British Airways PLC lost more luggage than any other major European airline last year, according to statistics 
released Wednesday.
Britain's Air Transport Users Council said that for every 1,000 passengers on the British carrier, 23 bags went 
astray the worst performance among 24 airlines who are members of the Association of European Airlines.
Across all the airlines, around 5.6 million bags went missing in 2006, an average of 15.7 bags per 1,000 
passengers.
Among those airlines which had worse-than-average figures were Germany's Lufthansa AG, Air France-KLM and 
Alitalia SpA.
About 85 percent of the bags were returned to passengers within 48 hours, the council said, but it added that some 
"never get returned at all."
The council said that the overall European figure could be much worse, because airlines such as Virgin Atlantic 
Airways Ltd. and bmi PLC do not provide luggage data. Also, budget airlines such as Ryanair Holdings PLC and 
easyJet PLC are not members of the Association of European airlines.
"We can only speculate on what the total might be for all airlines worldwide," said AUC chairman Tina Tietjen.
"Complaints to the council show that instances of mishandled baggage can cause passengers considerable stress, 
inconvenience and expense," she added. "They also show that passengers often struggle to get reasonable redress 
from airlines after the event."
BA's operations director Geoff Want said that the airline was dealing with a 25 percent increase in the number of 
checked in bags at Heathrow since last August's terror threat.
British Airways lost the most baggage among major European carriers in 2006
"The volumes of hold baggage going through Heathrow, the change in security procedures and some baggage 
system failures within Terminal 4 has not helped our performance, but we accept that overall the levels of service 
we offered to our customers has not been up to an acceptable standard," Want said.

Shares in Ireland's largest drugs wholesaler United Drug fell over 1pc today despite the company issuing a trading 
statement showing that the business is in good shape.
The firm said in a statement to the Irish Stock Exchange that its performance during the first half of 2007 was "in-
line with expectations". It added that it expects to show double-digit profit growth in its full year.
The company said the run-up to the new drug pricing regime in Ireland, which took effect from March 1, saw a 
slowdown in volume growth but that this will pick up again for the rest of the year. It added that it has achieved 
continued strong revenue growth in each of its four divisions.
 Goodbody analyst, Ian Hunter, said that although the statement was not expected to drive changes to its forecasts, 
it 'gives comfort that the transition into the new Irish drug pricing regime has gone smoothly'. Shares in United Drug 
closed 4c lower at 3.88 in Dublin last night. That performance was indicative of the market as a whole, with the 
ISEQ index of Irish shares ending today's session 43.51 points lower at 9,357.47. The sluggish trade was not 
helped by a volatile start to the session on Wall Street, with leading U.S. shares yo-yoing amid caution ahead of a 
key U.S. jobs report for March, due out tomorrow. Back in Dublin, financial shares continued their sluggish week, 
with AIB down 21c to 21.19, Bank of Ireland down 6c to 16.04 and Anglo Irish Bank down 16c to 15.60. Irish Life 
and Permanent slipped 25c to 20.40. Shares in building materials group CRH were down 12c to 32.47 despite 
figures released this week by the US National Association of Realtors, showing that the index of pending existing 
home sales in February rose 0.7pc month-on-month, compared to a consensus forecast decline of -0.5pc. 'This 
index is seen as a good leading indicator as it records contract signings, not closings which are usually a month or 
two later,' Goodbody said. Around 30pc of CRH's US sales are reported to come from the residential sector. Other 
shares in the construction sector were largely lower with Grafton down 5c to 11.33, McInerney down 4c to 15.36 
and Kingspan unchanged at 20.04. Housebuilder Abbey closed 6c higher at 11.66. Elsewhere, Elan was again in 
the black, up 5c to 10.25, after the United States Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday granted Fast Track

38.17. Even a near 4pc rise in both the shares of Paddy Power and Smurfit Kappa failed to lift the overall market. 
Shares in the bookmaker closed 55c higher at 20.80, while the paper and packaging firm was up 55c to 19.65.

The potential of offering in-flight telephone services to airlines has prompted broker Merrill Lynch to include 
Inmarsat in its list of favourite European stocks.
Shares of the telecommunications satellite company added 3p to 407.5p with 1.4 million going through the market, 
but on Tuesday they jumped over 5% valuing the company at around £1.86 billion.
Merrill Lynch is a buyer of the shares on which it has a target price of 455p, and in an 11-page research report 
highlights the companys continuing solid momentum in its core business and the potential income it stands to 
generate from in-flight telephone services.
The broker mentions Inmarsats recent acquisition of an option to buy one of the largest distributors of its services, 
US-based Stratos Global, in 2009.
Even without taking into account synergies, we expect the deal to be double-digit earnings-per-share accretive from 
2010 and beyond, the research report said.
From its base in London, Inmarsat operates 10 geostationary satellites that provide mobile phone, fax and data 
communication services to end users around the globe. 
Its customers include national governments and the United Nations, the BBC, CNN and ship owners, other 
broadcasters, airlines, banks and financial institutions. One customer is the US Army, another is NATO.
Later this year the company will introduce a hand-held satellite telephone, aimed at an existing market that Inmarsat 
expects to grab a 10% share of by 2010, says company spokesman John Warehand.
Hand-held satellite phones are used by emergency services, oil and gas companies, utilities and other 
organisations and businesses needing telephone services in areas not served by terrestrial mobile networks.
The in-flight mobile phone service business is awaiting regulatory approval which is expected later this year, 
Warehand said.
Ryanair and Emirates airlines are set to launch the new service which will allow passengers to use their regular 
mobile phones to make phone calls while in the air, according to Warehand. 
This could represent an additional $100 million a year opportunity for Inmarsat, Merrill Lynch said in its report.
Inmarsat shares head for sky as Merrill Lynch recommends stock
Last week the London Development Agency said it would invest £12 million in supporting an Inmarsat bid to win a 
£600 million satellite development contract from the European Space Agency where it is competing against Paris-
based Eutelsat.
Under ESA rules, the company is required to obtain some government funding, Warehand says. The company has 
already received commitments of funding from the South East of England Development Agency and the East of 
England Development Agency. The contract winner will be announced in July.
Last year, Inmarsats pre-tax profit fell 6% to $89.8 million compared with 2005 when demand for its satellite 
communications services was high following the Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina.
The US Army in Iraq was a good customer in 2005, but last year the Americans had less need of satellite services 
as they began to establish their own permanent networks, Inmarsat says. Revenue in 2006 climbed 1.8% to $500.1 
million from $491.1 million, the company reported in February.
Among Inmarsats largest shareholders, with about 9% each, are BlackRock Investment Management (UK), Legal & 
General Investment Managers and Lansdowne Partners. F&C Asset Management has around 6% while Prudential 
Assurance and KDDI each has around 5%.
Inmarsat began in 1979 as an Intergovernmental organization (IGO) providing communications services to the 
worlds maritime industry, which it continues to supply with a free distress and safety system. It was taken private in 
1999, and floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2005.

British Airways lost more bags per passenger last year than any other large airline in Europe, according to a report 
from the Association of European Airlines.
The Air Transport Users Council (AUC) in the UK called for the publication of "name and shame" league tables for 
airlines around the world in order to lead a drive for improved performance. It said European Union-wide league 
tables published by the European Commission "would be a good place to start".
The AEA statistics show that BA lost 23 bags per 1,000 passengers last year compared with 21 at TAP Air 
Portugal, 18.1 at Lufthansa and 16.6 at Air France.
Tina Tietjen, who chairs the AUC, said the rising number of complaints to the council showed that mishandled 
baggage could cause passengers "considerable stress, inconvenience and expense. They also show that 
passengers often struggle to get reasonable redress from airlines after the event.
"When passengers hand over their suitcases at check-in they should be able to expect to see them at the other 
end."
Geoff Want, BA operations director, apologised to customers and accepted the overall level of service had "not 
been up to an accept-able standard".
BA has suffered particular problems at its London Heathrow base in recent months after much tighter security 
regulations were imposed last August in response to an alleged plot to blow up airliners across the Atlantic using 
liquid explosives.
Mr Want said the number of bags BA was handling at Heathrow had risen by 25 per cent since August, and this had 
been reflected in more lost bags in the second half of the year. The airline was also hit by baggage-system failures 
at Heathrow in the busy Christmas period.
The AEA report is based on statistics from 24 airlines. Its membership does not include the low-cost carriers such 
as Ryanair and EasyJet and some member airlines such as Virgin Atlantic and BMI do not providestatistics.

Body
The ISEQ index closed sharply higher today on the back of sharp gains in pharmaceutical group Elan.
Shares in Elan were up 30c to 10.20 after the United States Food and Drug Administration granted Fast Track 
designation to an investigational Alzheimer's drug that it is developing in collaboration with Transition Therapeutics 
Inc. AZD-103/ELND005 is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase I clinical studies, and the companies 
anticipate starting Phase II clinical studies around the end of 2007. Transition Therapeutics is a Canadian 
biopharmaceutical company.
The news gave a lift to Elan's share price which had been hit on Monday by the news that its Multiple Sclerosis 
drug Tysabri will not be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK. The National Institute for Health 
ruled that the use of Tysabri was not a cost effective use of NHS resources. This follows on from the Scottish 
Medicines Consortium decision last year that on economic grounds Tysabri should not be used for treatment on the 
NHS. Dolmen Stockbrokers said the UK is the second largest market for Tysabri in Europe and may have 
accounted for up to 8pc of the drugs' target market.
 The sharp gains in Elan helped the overall ISEQ index of Irish shares up 60.41 points to 9,400.98. Trading in the 
financial sector was mixed, with Bank of Ireland up 10c to 16.10, Anglo Irish Bank down 16c to 15.76 and AIB down 
12c to 21.45. Shares in Irish Life and Permanent jumped 10c to 20.65. CRH was the star performer among 
construction shares, climbing 56c to 32.59, while Kingspan tacked on 24c to 20.03 and McInerney ended the 
session 10c higher at 15.60. Grafton was up 13c to 11.76. Other notable movers included drinks group CandC, 
down 13c to 11.30, no-frills airline Ryanair, up 13c to 6.02, and bookmaker Paddy Power, down 45c to 20.15. 
Meanwhile, shares in United Drug were up 2c to 3.92. The pharmaceutical wholesaler is due to issue a trading 
update for the first half of 2007 tomorrow. Goodbody said it expects "little data" to be released, other than an 
indication that the first half trading is in-line with management's expectations. "We are forecasting that the company 
will report a 17.7pc increase in adjusted earnings per share over H1 2006 to 11c from a 12.3pc increase in revenue 
Elan soars 3pc on FDA Alzheimer's ruling
to E794.9m," Goodbody analyst Ian Hunter said. "Trading conditions should not have been unduly affected by the 
impact of the first phase of the Irish drug pricing review, which saw the price of patented drugs for which there is 
already a generic equivalent on the market, cut by 20pc on March 1." Elsewhere, the Dublin market also received a 
boost from a positive opening in the U.S. following the release of reassuring US pending home sales data. The 
National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of existing homes increased at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 0.7pc to 109.3 in February, up from a reading of 108.5 in January. The index was 8.5pc below its 
level of a year earlier, but stronger than the market had been expecting. Traders said the data reassured investors 
that the US housing sector, while weak, is not being pummelled by the struggling subprime mortgage sector.

Simulation Graham Warwick / Washington DCCanadian flight simulator manufacturer CAE has launched a new 
product aimed at the narrowbody airliner market and focused on recurrent and third-party training. The 5000-series 
full-flight simulator is a standardised device for the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, as well as business jets, with 
smaller and simpler visual, motion and interface systems to reduce footprint and life-cycle costs.Training schools 
exemplify the market, says Marc Parent, group president, simulation products, because they want a standard 
simulator that is not "tail-specific". The company has also announced the 7000 - a "refresh" of its customised, tail-
specific Level D simulator aimed at the widebody market.The new simulator comes in two models with list prices of 
$8C-11 million ($7-9.5 million): the 5200 aimed at recurrent training and upgradable to the more expensive 5400 
Level D device suitable for initial training. Cost-reducing features include electric motion and PC-based visual 
system with liquid-crystal-on-silicon projectors. 
"The device has a smaller footprint - where a training centre can fit six traditional simulators it can get nine 5000s," 
say Parent.Although the simulator does not use aircraft parts, it uses the same software models as CAE's Level D 
simulators. With narrowbodies forecast to account for 60% of deliveries over the next 20 years, target customers 
include repeat buyers of simulators for high-volume aircraft and smaller airlines moving to in-house training.Launch 
customers are CAE's own global training network Lufthansa Flight Training, which has ordered an A320 machine 
and Ryanair, for five 737 simulators.

Butcher? Baker? Candlestick maker? Which are the best professions for providing advisers with potentially lucrative 
streams of business? Each week, our Business Class feature will provide a snapshot guide to how various 
occupations can provide financial planning opportunities. Andrew Michael reports.
Flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.Douglas Adams
With more people taking to the skies than ever before, air transport is a flourishing industry. At its heart is, of 
course, the role played by commercial airline pilots. With decent earnings potential and financial planning needs 
specific to a responsible profession, UK pilots can provide a rich seam of business for IFAs with high-flying clients.
BUSINESS BACKGROUND
Why advise pilots?
&#61548; Air travel has never been more popular and pilots are more in demand than ever before. A recent 
YouGov survey carried out for the British Air Transport Association (www.bata.uk.com) confirmed the widespread 
popularity of air travel in the UK. The majority of the population travel by air at least once each year and most of us 
are flying more than we used to just five years ago. Also, 74% of the population have flown in the last five years, 
with 72% of those flying at least once a year.
&#61548; It is estimated around 10,000 professional pilots work in the UK. Over 75% of Britains pilots and flight 
engineers belong to the British Air Line Pilots Association (BALPA). BALPA is among the worlds largest flight crew 
associations and aims to protect and improve the professional status, pay and conditions of its members. 
Membership stands currently at more than 9,000.
&#61548; According to Prospects (www.prospects.ac.uk), the UKs official graduate careers website, pilots salaries 
vary according to experience as well as the type of aircraft being flown. Pilots and first officers are paid more for 
flying jet aircraft than for flying turboprop planes. With information collected in January 2007, Prospects says that at 
EasyJet, the salary of a fully qualified captain is £73,792 while Ryanair can pay an experienced captain up to 
£100,000. Pilots are employed by approximately 200 different companies in the UK.
&#61548; UK airports handled 235 million passengers in 2006, an increase of nearly 3% on 2005, according to 
recent figures from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The total tonnage of freight and mail carried from UK airports 
in 2006 was 2.5 million tonnes. BUSINESS BRAINS

A chance to hear from IFA companies who provide advice to professionals in this weeks spotlight.
BALPA Financial Services, Middlesex
BALPA Financial Services (BFS) is an IFA which is wholly-owned by the British Air Line Pilots Association.
BFS is based in Hayes but provides national coverage to BALPA members. Throughout 2007, BFS is planning to 
run a number of pre-retirement planning and pension drawdown workshops.
Aircrew and their families have specialist needs, says BFS. Assisting our clients to plan for their futures normally 
requires us to consider all aspects of their financial well being. We ensure that we highlight any protection needs, 
investment or tax saving opportunities that exist. Loss of earnings through ill-health is probably the most important 
area for air crew to protect against. We offer a specialist Loss of Flying Licence policy which can be used where 
there is no cover, or to complement any existing cover. BFS offers two types of Loss of Flying Licence cover, one 
for qualified commercial pilots and the other for trainees.
Collingwood Mourton Associates, Cheltenham
One of my clients is a self-employed pilot whose business involves flying chartered-style requests, says Christopher 
Morris, investment adviser and financial planner at Collingwood Mourton Associates.
Life and critical illness products can load heavily against this sort of profession, and that makes it expensive for the 
client to take out a policy. But given the job, it is imperative that the individual understands that he needs to have 
some kind of cover. Not taking indemnity commission upfront speeds the process and allows the situation to be 
reviewed.
Income patterns can also be spiky in this line of business and that can have an impact on the pensions and 
mortgage advice which is offered. It is also important to follow where the earnings are coming from. Cash payments 
might be fine for the client in this line of business but they need to be tallied when aggregating income streams over 
the year.
REGIONAL BUSINESS FLYING HIGH
The growth in air travel from regional airports means that it is not just southern or London-based IFAs who are able 
to capitalise by adding pilots to their books.
Traffic at the UKs regional airports grew by 4% to 98 million passengers in 2006 according to the CAA. Among the 
10 largest regional airports, the fastest growing were Liverpool, up by 600,000 passengers from the previous year, 
then Nottingham East Midlands, which saw passengers numbers rise by 500,000 over the same period. 
Manchester Airport still handles the most passengers outside London.
Landings and take-offs by commercial aircrafts at UK airports grew by 2% from 2005 to 2.4 million last year. At the 
UKs regional airports landings and take-offs reached 1.4 million, an increase of 1% on 2005.

Shares in AIB slumped almost 3pc today as the Dublin market started the week in a negative fashion.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the session 34.73 points lower at 9,340.57.
The financials were the biggest fallers, with AIB down a disappointing 61c to 21.59 and Bank of Ireland 15c lower at 
16.00. Anglo Irish Bank slipped 10c to 15.90, while Irish Life and Permanent remained unchanged on 20.55.
 Elsewhere, shares in the construction sector were also largely lower. Grafton fell 16c to 11.19, while Kingspan lost 
5c to 19.80 and McInerney dropped 15c to 15.50. Building materials firm CRH made modest headway, up 6c to 
32.03, while Abbey was up 1c to 11.51. Elsewhere, other notable movers included Elan, up 30c to 9.90 and Paddy 
Power, up 80c to 20.60. No frills airline Ryanair was a notable gainer, up 6c to 5.89, while fellow airline Aer Lingus 
added on 5c to 3.10. The airlines made their way back up, having been hit by rising oil prices last week on the back 
of rising tensions between the West and Iran. Shares in drinks group C and C were up 6c to 11.43 on reports that it 
is to target Munich in Germany with its Magners cider. "If correct, it would mean that its two target Continental cities 
are Barcelona in Spain and Munich," Goodbody analyst Liam Igoe said. "Germany has a strong beer / lager 
tradition, which would lend itself to Magners, which sees itself as an alternative to beer/lager as much as being a 
cider drink. Structurally, however, the German market is very regional and if they do launch in Munich, it will be a 
challenge to take it to the next step of rolling out the brand throughout Germany." Meanwhile, United Drug was 
down 10c to 3.90 as investors awaited a trading update from the pharmaceutical group tomorrow. Shares in Irish 
Continental Group slumped almost 2pc ahead of the upcoming key shareholder vote on whether to accept a E470m 
takeover bid from the company's management. The overall Dublin market traded in the red for virtually all of the 
day, however, it did manage a slight recovery late on thanks to a pick-up in trading on Wall Street. Stocks across 
the Atlantic had opened markedly lower after data showed that U.S. manufacturing had been more sluggish than 
expected during March, a further sign that the economy continues to grow at a slower pace. Stocks pulled back 
initially after the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index slipped more than economists 
ISEQ down as financials weigh heavy
projected in March. The index moved to a reading of 50.9 last month, compared to an expected reading of 52.0. 
Wall Street has traded nervously the past few weeks on concerns about rising inflation and the overall health of the 
economy. On Friday, the major indexes finished the first quarter lower - with the Dow Jones industrials down 108 
points in their feeblest performance since the second quarter of 2005.

Highlight: As the airline industry continues with lacklustre profits, cutting costs could make or break some carriers. 
Geoff Hearn reports.
Body
The airline industry has been in crisis since 2001, says Giovanni Bisignani, director-general and chief executive 
officer of the International Air Transport Association (Iata). It has avoided financial disaster by restructuring its costs. 
Bisignani adds that labour productivity has improved by 33% during the period, sales and distribution costs have 
been cut by 10% and total non-fuel costs have fallen 13%. All this has been achieved while absorbing an extra fuel 
cost of $72 billion. But George Williams, a reader in Airline Economics at Cranfield University, is cautious about the 
scope for future cost cutting. "Most airlines have done the easy things and it will be extremely difficult for the 
industry to continue making the level of savings it has achieved in recent years," he says. Much of the progress that 
has been made in recent years has been in the reduction of indirect costs. Iata is aiming to cut $6.5 billion from 
industry costs by improving ticketing processes. Direct costs are often more of a challenge. Aircraft financing, 
insurance costs, fuel bills, maintenance, crew costs, landing and navigation fees, handling and catering costs are all 
areas where airlines are striving to obtain savings, but with different levels of success. 
Paying for the aircraft Despite the complex structures behind aircraft financing, the costs are usually relatively 
transparent to the airline. This transparency means it is the focus of tough negotiations when aircraft are bought 
and sold. But, as many lessors have found to their cost, an airline facing financial difficulties can also be in a 
position to renegotiate lease rates if the demand for aircraft is weak. The impact of aircraft utilization (productivity) 
on capital cost is often underestimated or even overlooked. However, much of the success of low-cost carriers has 
derived from the ability of such airlines to maximize utilization and drive down the (fixed) capital cost per flight hour. 
EasyJet and Ryanair typically operate their aircraft for 11 hours a day, which is close to double the productivity 
achieved by some of their competitors. 
Keeping fuel bills in check Although fuel prices have returned from their record levels, fuel bills are still historically 
high and fuel efficiency is still a cornerstone of any cost cutting plan. There is much interest in the fuel-saving 
capability of winglets (both installed and retrofitted). Older less fuel-efficient aircraft are losing their value. Airlines 
are increasingly turning to innovative methods to reduce fuel consumption. 
Finding a cheap place to land Airports are often effective monopolies, making it difficult for airlines to negotiate 
lower costs. The recent bidding war for BAA is an indication of just how attractive the airport business can be. Low-
cost carriers such as Ryanair have got round this to some extent by using secondary airports. The use of these less 
SHRED OR DREAD
convenient destinations has its problems from a marketing perspective, but has another benefit in the battle to cut 
costs. Secondary airports are less congested, enabling faster aircraft turn-rounds. This allows improved utilization - 
effectively lowering capital cost as described above. 
The use of shortcuts Inefficiencies in the air traffic management system are among the biggest bugbears of airlines. 
Long detours and holding patterns add hugely to fuel bills, but at least some service providers are beginning to 
deliver on reducing delays and providing more direct services. 
Expensive drivers Aircraft manufacturers make much of how their aircraft help improve crew productivity. Airbus, in 
particular, claims the ability of crews to swap between types within the Airbus family (cross crew qualification) 
provides the potential for significant cost savings. In reality, the ability to maximize crew productivity and keep 
salaries and benefits in check is crucial to the cost structure of all airlines. The regular conflicts between crew 
unions and airline management are testament to the importance of this expense. 
Checking costs Maintenance is not only a very large contributor to cost, but also it is arguably the most 
unpredictable. Heavy checks on older aircraft, in particular, often spring nasty surprises on budgets. The labour-
intensive nature of heavy maintenance means there is an opportunity, at least for long-haul carriers, of reducing 
heavy maintenance costs by outsourcing work to regions with lower manpower costs. For example, a 747 heavy 
check in China costs about $3 million. The equivalent cost in Europe is about $5.5 million. The airframe 
manufacturers have different approaches to the most cost-effective way of supporting the airlines. Boeing's 
approach is to provide more inclusive services on a flight-hour basis. Airbus has tried a more tailored approach, 
arguing that different airline strategies require different support approaches - otherwise the operator ends up paying 
unnecessary costs for services he can do in-house. Providing maintenance on a flight-hour basis is an established 
feature of the engine business, where original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) were quick to spot that there was 
a lucrative after-sales market. Despite the perception that they have cornered the engine-overhaul business, the 
OEMs insist that costs have come down in real terms over the past decade. The main driver for these claimed 
reductions is an improvement in reliability and shop-visit rates, which have derived from the manufacturers' 
involvement in the overhaul business. David Stewart, principal at Aerostrategy, is not completely convinced. "It is 
not as simple as that. Engine reliability is up but so is the average cost of the overhaul [because new engines are 
more complex] and so is average utilization. At the same time, the manufacturers are inexorably escalating the 
price of parts, and engine overhaul is 65% material cost. So, yes, engine MROs work very hard at keeping costs 
down but our view is that total overhaul costs to the airlines are probably increasing." Some airlines still hold out 
hope that Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) parts will provide some competition in the engine after-sales 
business. As Stewart points out, PMA parts still only represent 2% to 3% of annual material spend and this is going 
to increase. The recent entry of Pratt & Whitney into the CFM56 market might well be a catalyst for an increased 
role for PMA. One way that airlines can save money in maintenance is by reducing spares investment by 
participating in pooling or inventory support schemes where access to spares is assured by payments on a flight-
hour basis. Modern aircraft are characterized by components that are very reliable, but which have high capital 
costs. One airline executive told Airfinance Journal: "It makes no sense for an airline to stock a component that 
might cost $400,000 and which only fails every 30,000 hours, leaving it on the shelf for five years or so." 
Catering The provision of catering has traditionally been seen as a cost, particularly in the premium market. But no-
frills operators have changed this perception by turning it into a revenue stream. The British Airways/Gate Gourmet 
debacle is a warning of what can go wrong if cost cutting (and outsourcing) is badly handled. Despite the difficulties 
of further cost cutting, the airlines will need to achieve more efficiency gains if the return to profitability in 2007 
forecast by Iata is to be realized. n

The founders of TPG, led by David Bonderman, cemented their reputation for being smart, contrarian investors 
when they bought Continental Airlines, the ailing US carrier that fell into bankruptcy in the early 1990s, writes Peter 
Smith in London.
Their Dollars 66m equity investment in Continental was converted into almost Dollars 700m, a massive return for a 
buy-out deal.
Iberia is one of at least three international airlines now being stalked by TPG.
The US buy-out group is part of a team that has tabled an ADollars 11.1bn (USDollars 8.9bn) recommended bid for 
Australia's Qantas and it is one of several groups interested in Alitalia, the Italian carrier.
Apart from Continental, TPG scored another home run in the US with the buy-out of America West, another ailing 
carrier that had also fallen into bankruptcy.
Both companies were turned round and sold in more favourable markets.
Mr Bonderman also has board experience at a European airline and is chairman of Ryanair, the fast-growing Irish 
budget carrier.
TPG has a long tradition of undertaking complex and counter-cyclical investments sometimes with a splash of 
daring, traits that will be useful if it meets resistance from labour unions at Iberia.

Ryanair, the Irish low-cost airline, has reacted angrily to a leaked antitrust opinion that its proposed merger with Aer 
Lingus, its former state-owned rival, would be anti-competitive.
A European Commission opinion obtained by Bloomberg, the news agency, said the tie-up was "likely to 
significantly impede effective competition" by "eliminating the most credible potential entrant" on 37 routes to and 
from Dublin. The airlines would have 80 per cent of the market, it said.
Ryanair, however, termed the findings "bizarre" and "politically motivated".
The company said: "They also fly in the face of the wave of national consolidations which have and continue to take 
place across Europe."
Ryanair said the competition authorities have approved big deals such as the Euros 3.8bn (Pounds 2.6bn) Air 
France takeover of KLM and the Lufthansa takeovers of Swiss and Austrian airlines.
"It appears that yet again the European Commission has one set of rules for flag carrier airlines and a different, 
unique set of rules for efficient low-fare airlines like Ryanair."
The Commission declined to comment, as did Aer Lingus. Ryanair has a 25 per cent stake in the airline that will 
cause a headache if it cannot complete a takeover. It accused the Irish government, which also holds 25 per cent, 
of putting pressure on the Commission.
Ryanair's original Euros 1.5bn bid expired in December when the Commission said it would investigate. It will have 
the right to a hearing before the Commission takes a final decision in June. Brussels could veto the deal or call for 
disposals or other amendments.

Although privatised six years ago, Iberia is still closely associated with the state in the minds of most Spaniards, 
partly because of the lingering public service mentality of its work force.
But while the airline is still synonymous with tardiness, poor service and summer strikes, most analysts recognise 
the progress made in recent years in implanting a corporate culture.
This has given it the agility to respond to competition from budget carriers and soaring fuel costs, they say, and 
makes it especially attractive to a financial sponsor, either alone or together with a trade buyer.
"Iberia has come a long way, but there is still a lot that can be done to improve efficiency and profitability," says 
Luisa Alemany from the Esade business school in Barcelona.
"A private equity buyer might have the tools to complete the transition and so add value to the company more 
quickly."
The company's performance has improved steadily over the years, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation is expected to grow 40 per cent over the next three years, according to Merrill Lynch.
The inauguration last year of a high-capacity terminal at Madrid's Barajas airport has helped Iberia consolidate the 
Spanish capital as Europe's most important hub for Latin American traffic. Two years ago it overtook Air-France-
KLM as the leading carrier between the two markets, and today claims market share of about 20 per cent. It has 
also opened routes to South Africa and the Middle East.
Long-haul business last year accounted for 41 per cent of total revenues, compared with 34 per cent in 2004.
There was a corresponding reduction in the weight of domestic business, where Iberia has been under attack from 
local start-ups such as Vueling, and aggressive expansion by low-costcarriers.
Iberia 's long haul on to the deal table The carrier has become an attractive target, say Mark Mulligan and 
Kevin Done
Both Ryanair and EasyJet have been quick to capitalise on the expansion at Barajas, recently setting up Madrid 
bases to expand their range of European routes and offer some domestic services. Iberia's response has been to 
help finance Catair, a Barcelona-based carrier, and plan more cuts to its domestic routes.
A takeover bid led by TPG of the US would need strong support from Spanish interests, which would need to hold 
at least 51 per cent of the Iberia equity so as not to jeopardise its status as a Spanish national carrier.
International aviation is still governed by an arcane web of regulations stemming from the 1944 Chicago 
Convention, which essentially ties an airline's traffic rights to its national ownership, ties that are laid downin 
bilateral state-to-state treaties.
Reform is slowly under way, but the risk of losing traffic rights lay behind the complicated structure of the deal in 
early 2004 in which Air France effectivelytook over KLM, the first acquisition of a European flag carrier by a rival 
airline.
The same issue explains why Germany's Lufthansa has still not formally taken control of Swiss International Air 
Lines in spite of the announcement of the deal in early 2005.
The successful precedents set by the Air France-KLM and Lufthansa-Swiss deals suggest, however, that the 
hurdles can be overcome to allow eventual takeovers by any of the big three European carriers Air France-KLM, 
Lufthansa or British Airways.
With its existing stake of 10 per cent, two members on the Iberia board and rights of first refusal on a further 30 per 
cent, BA has first shout to join a TPG-led bid.

BAA faces two competition referrals

The future of BAA, the UK airports group taken over last year by a consortium led by Spain's Ferrovial, was plunged 
into uncertainty yesterday with the launch of two parallel investigations by the Competition Commission.
The Office of Fair Trading said it had decided to refer the supply of airport services by BAA in the UK to the 
commission for an investigation that could last up to two years and lead to the BAA London airports monopoly being 
broken up.
The probe was welcomed by BAA's leading airline customers, many of which, including British Airways, Ryanair 
and EasyJet, have already called for the break-up of the group and for separate ownership of the three leading 
London airports - Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
Separately the Civil Aviation Authority, the economic regulator for BAA's three London airports, yesterday made its 
mandatory referral to the Competition Commission, triggering a six-month investigation of its proposals for the next 
five-year price cap regime for the charges to be levied on airlines at Heathrow and Gatwick from April next year.
The CAA is proposing a reduction in the financial returns allowed to BAA, and the airports group has already 
warned that such a cut would make "unviable" some of its ambitious planned investments in new terminals at 
Heathrow, most importantly the Pounds 1.5bn Heathrow East project to replace the existing Terminals 1 and 2.
The OFT said that its Competition Commission referral was made under its power to investigate markets "in which it 
appears competition is prevented, restricted or distorted".
John Fingleton, OFT chief executive, said last Dec-ember that the office believed the current airport market 
structure did "not deliver best value forair passengers" and greater competition could bring significant benefits for 
passengers.
"There is evidence of poor quality and high charges - BAA's investment plans, which are of great importance to the 
UK, have raised significant concerns among its customers. These are signs of a market not working well for 
consumers," he said.
BAA faces two competition referrals
BAA controls seven airports in the UK, which handled 145m passengers in the year to March 2006. It accounts for 
about 63 per cent of all UK air passengers and owns the three leading London airports, three Scottish airports - 
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen - as well as Southampton.
It handled 92 per cent of all the passengers using London airports in 2005, and 86 per cent of passenger volumes 
in Scotland.
Remedies following an investigation by the Competition Commission could include the divestment of airports, 
airport runways or terminals.
The twin referrals to the Competition Commission come less than a year after BAA, the world's leading airports 
group, passed into non-UK ownership with its Pounds 10.1bn acquisition by a consortium led by Ferrovial, the 
Spanish construction, infrastructure and services group.
Stephen Nelson, BAA chief executive, said yesterday the "fundamental problem" for passengers was "lack of 
capacity, not the structure of BAA".
BAA was planning "nothing less than the transformation of Britain's biggest airports", he said, including a Pounds 
9.3bn capital spending plan for the three London airports. "Putting BAA in the dock for a complex set of problems - 
with deep legacy causes - will not help solve them," said Mr Nelson.
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost carrier and the biggest operator at Stansted, welcomed the probe and said: 
"The BAA monopoly should now be broken up to allow competition, improved services, lower airport costs and the 
development of sensible cost-efficient facilities, where the current BAA monopoly and ineffective regulator (the 
CAA) have clearly failed."

Body
The ownership of London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports was thrown into doubt Friday with the announcement 
that airports operator BAA PLC will be subject to a competition inquiry after airlines complained about the 
company's dominance.
The Office of Fair Trading said it was referring the investigation into BAA, owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, to 
the more powerful Competition Commission after its own three-month probe received scores of complaints from 
airlines, consumers and organizations.
The Competition Commission has the power to order BAA to sell off one or more of the seven airports it operates 
around Britain, including Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
The Office of Fair Trading said it believes the London airports may serve consumers better under separate 
ownership BAA's airports currently handle around 90 percent of passenger flights made in southeast England and 
63 percent of all flights to and from Britain.
The inquiry, expected to take up to two years, will focus on BAA's ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted 
and whether it distorts competition to the detriment of passengers. It will also examine BAA's ownership of both 
Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.
The referral to the Competition Commission came as industry regulator the Civil Aviation Authority detailed 
measures to penalize BAA if service levels at Heathrow and Gatwick are not met.
The Civil Aviation Authority said it plans to impose greater financial penalties on BAA when passenger services fall 
short, and incremental bonuses for the company if passenger service across each airport is above agreed 
standards.
BAA was heavily criticized for its response to last summer's terrorist alert, when tighter security controls led to long 
delays at Heathrow and Gatwick. Heathrow particularly is subject to persistent delays because it is operating close 
to capacity a new fifth Terminal that will help ease congestion is still a year away from completion.
Airports operator BAA faces full investigation by UK competition watchdog
BAA said Friday that a "strong and united" company was needed to ensure the long-term investments can be made 
to improve British airports.
"Our analysis is that the fundamental problems for passengers is lack of capacity, not the structure of BAA," he 
said.
Complaints about BAA's airports management have been led by low-cost airlines Ryanair Holdings PLC and 
easyJet PLC.
Ryanair, which is based at London's Stansted airport, said the decision to refer the investigation to the Competition 
Commission was "good news for consumers."

Ireland 's Ryanair accuses EU of bias over report it opposes Aer Lingus takeover

Ryanair Holdings PLC accused the European Union competition authority of bias Friday after reports suggested it 
was opposed to Ryanair's hope of acquiring rival Irish airline Aer Lingus.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest no-frills airline, shelved its takeover plans in December when the European 
Commission's antitrust unit said it was launching a detailed investigation into whether a combined Ryanair-Aer 
Lingus airline would produce an Irish monopoly. But Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has stressed a new 
bid would be launched if the EU cleared the way.
Ryanair cited leaks of a 265-page report by the EU Competition Commission that calls a Ryanair-Aer Lingus merger 
"likely to significantly impede effective competition" by "eliminating the most credible potential entrant" on 37 Dublin 
routes.
EU Competition spokesman Jonathan Todd refused to comment on whether the report was accurate. He said the 
authority would reveal its verdict by a June 13 deadline.
But Ryanair accused the EU of seeking to support the Irish government, which privatized Aer Lingus in September 
and opposes the October takeover bid by Ryanair.
Ryanair said the EU's reported position was "clearly designed to appease the political interests of the Irish 
government, rather than advancing the interests of Irish consumers and visitors."
Ryanair owns 25.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares and will need to gain 50 percent to seize control of its Dublin-
based rival. But the government and employee share-ownership trusts hold more than 40 percent of shares and say 
they won't sell to Ryanair at any price.
Ryanair also accused the EU of hypocrisy, given its approval of other mergers involving former state carriers, such 
as Air France's takeover of KLM Dutch Airlines and Lufthansa's acquisition of Austrian Airlines and Swiss Air. It said 
Ireland 's Ryanair accuses EU of bias over report it opposes Aer Lingus takeover
U.S. airlines would increasingly be targeting Ireland because of the recently concluded deal for an EU-U.S. "open 
skies" agreement.
"It is clear that the EU Competition Commission is applying a different and unique standard to the Ryanair-Aer 
Lingus offer which flies in the face of all previous decisions and runs contrary to the wave of mergers and takeovers 
which is now in train following EU-US open skies," Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard said.
Any future Ryanair bid would likely cost more than O'Leary's October offer of €2.80 (US$3.75) a share, which had 
been a 27 percent premium over the IPO price.
Aer Lingus shares have surged since the "open skies" deal and Ireland's own bilateral deal with the United States, 
which has cleared the way for Aer Lingus to open new routes this autumn to Washington, San Francisco and 
Orlando, Florida.
Aer Lingus shares fell €0.20, or 6.2 percent, to close Friday at €3.05 (US$4.69) on the Irish Stock Exchange. They 
reached a record high of €3.35 (US$4.49) earlier this week.

Highlight: Ryanair welcomed the UK OFT decision to refer the BAA "monopoly" to the Competition Commission
Body
No- frills airline Ryanair today welcomed the UK Office of Fair Trading's decision to refer the BAA "monopoly" to the 
Competition Commission. 
This comes after the UK's Office of Fair Trading referred the BAA, to the Competition Commission.
The OFT said today that the case for a wide-ranging investigation into BAA by the Commission was "now 
warranted" following pressure from airlines, consumers and other organisations
 The carrier says that "the BAA monopoly should now be broken up to allow competition, improved services, lower 
airport costs and the development of sensible cost efficient facilities where the current BAA monopoly and 
ineffective regulator (the CAA) have clearly failed." Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's head of 
communications said, "This referral is good news for consumers. Ryanair has long called on the CAA to take action 
to end monopoly abuse by the BAA, which has resulted in inadequate facilities and excessive passenger charges at 
the London airports in particular. Let's face it, Heathrow is a mess, passengers continue to be stuck in long security 
queues at Stansted and Gatwick's development is being held back by this over charging monopoly. "Ryanair calls 
on the Competition Commission to break up the BAA airport monopoly which has failed over 20 years to meet the 
needs of passengers. By spinning out Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted into separately owned companies, which 
are then forced to compete against each other, improved terminal facilities and lower cost terminal and car parking 
charges will evolve in much the same way that competition between the airlines - led by Ryanair - has lowered air 
fares and delivered enormous growth at the UK airports. "Regulation by the CAA has clearly failed, it's time to allow 
competition between the London airports to deliver better facilities and lower costs for British passengers and 
British business".

Body
Shares in Aer Lingus slumped over 6pc today as oil prices remained above USD68 per barrel on ongoing tensions 
between Iran and the West.
Prices of crude oil have soared in recent days amid a political standoff between Britain and Iran over the detainment 
of 15 marines and sailors. This has raised fears of interruptions to the oil supply through Iran, which in turn has sent 
shares in major airlines sharply lower.
Shares in Aer Lingus ended the session 20c lower at 3.05, while Ryanair slipped 7c to 5.83.
 Those falls were enough to drag the ISEQ into the red, with the overall index ending the day 35.33 points lower at 
9,375.30, but well-off session lows. Shares made a modest recovery in late afternoon trade, buoyed by a positive 
opening on Wall Street as investors were encouraged by a rise in consumer spending and incomes and growth in 
Chicago-area manufacturing. A report from the U.S. Commerce Department showed that both consumer spending 
and personal incomes rose 0.6pc last month. This appeared to lift investor sentiment, which has been dogged by 
concerns about a slowing economy. The increases were double what Wall Street had expected. However, the data 
also showed that core inflation rose that month at the fastest rate since August - which could make some investors 
pause, as quickening inflation could compel the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Back in Dublin, the 
financials threw up something of a mixed bag with Irish Life and Permanent up 30c to 20.55, AIB down 5c to 22.20 
and Bank of Ireland down 10c to 16.15. Anglo Irish Bank ended the session 13c lower at 16.00. Shares in CRH 
were up 18c to 32.09 after it this week announced a E210m investment in Ukraine. The money will be used to 
convert its current cement plant from a wet to dry process. Dry process cement production is estimated to be 30-
40pc cheaper than the wet process. Elsewhere in the construction sector, Grafton fell 5c to 11.30, while McInerney 
tacked on 15c to 15.65 and Kingspan fell 15c to 19.85. Drinks group CandC was up 2c to 11.37 after it this week 
launched its marketing campaign for Magners in Barcelona. The company is trying to find out whether its cider has 
a future in the market and is set to invest up to E5m over the next 12 months to trial the product. "The intensive 
ISEQ down as Aer Lingus shares slump 6pc
advertising is the start of CandC's efforts to determine whether or not there is long term demand for Magners in 
Spain outside the traditional resorts, where the product is mainly sold to Irish and British tourists," Goodbody said. 
CandC will also trial the product in two other continental areas later in the year. Goodbody has predicted that the 
Portuguese market will be tried given the "geographic logistics". Elan slumped 42c to 9.60 as it confirmed that it will 
report its first quarter 2007 financial results on April 24. Other notable movers included bookmaker Paddy Power, 
down 18c to 19.80, paper and packaging group Smurfit Kappa, up 19c to 18.70, and business support services 
group DCC, up 32c to 26.40.

Ryanair has reacted angrily to leaks that the EU has drawn up a list of 'charges' against Ryairair's bid for Aer 
Lingus.
EU competition officials there have drawn up a series of objections to the plan, which they will now put to the airline.
Ryanair said that these findings "run contrary to the European Commission's stated policy of supporting airline 
consolidation, are not supported by evidence, and are bizarre from a Commission which has previously approved 
mergers between Air France and KLM, Lufthansa and Austrian, and Lufthansa and Swiss Airlines."
 "These findings fly in the face of these EU airline precedents, and are clearly designed to appease the political 
interests of the Irish Government, rather than advancing the interests of Irish consumers and visitors," a Ryanair 
statement said. Ryanair will now be given an opportunity to respond to the charges, listed in a statement of 
objections, and to have a closed hearing before a Commission hearing officer. The E1.48bn bid for Aer Lingus 
lapsed automatically when authorities decided to conduct an in-depth investigation, but the company has said it 
intends to make a second offer. The European Commission, regulatory arm of the European Union, has until June 
13th to decide whether the proposed bid is compatible with EU merger laws, whether it would be anti-competitive or 
if any problems may be resolved through possible changes in the transaction.

Just after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 115.32 points to 9,295.31. The ISEQ closed up more

The Dublin market roared back to life today having languished in the red for the five previous sessions.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 140.99 points higher at 9,410.63 on the back of sharp gains in the financial 
sector.
Irish Life and Permanent was the star performer, jumping 61c to 20.26, while AIB and Bank of Ireland both closed 
comfortably higher, up 44c to 22.26 and 36c to 16.26 respectively. Shares in Anglo Irish Bank also made modest 
progress, jumping18c to 16.13.
 The overall market also received additional support from a positive opening on Wall Street. Investor sentiment in 
the U.S. was bolstered by a report showing that the economy grew at a slightly speedier pace in the last three 
months of 2006 than previously thought. The Commerce Department estimated the economy grew at a 2.5pc 
annualised rate between October and December, faster than the 2.2pc earlier estimated. Meanwhile, figures from 
the Labour Department showed that initial claims for U.S. state unemployment fell 10,000 to 308,000 in the week 
ending March 24, against analyst forecasts for a moderate rise. Back in Dublin, CRH led the way in the construction 
sector, adding on 48c to 31.93, after it today confirmed that it has invested a total of E210m to upgrade its cement 
plant in Western Ukraine. Grafton and Kingspan also made modest progress, tacking on 8c to 11.35 and 23c to 
20.00 respectively. Shares in McInerney were unchanged at 15.50, while housebuilder Abbey jumped 12c to 11.77. 
Elsewhere, pharmaceutical group Elan moved higher, up 23c to 10.03, while drinks group CandC slipped 11c to

DCC down 11c to 26.08 and no-frills airline Ryanair up 5c to 5.90. Bathroom fittings firm Qualceram Shires ended 
the session 9c lower at 2.06 despite today posting a return to profit during 2006. The company said it recorded pre-
tax profits of E3.9m compared to a loss the previous year of E5.1m. The results were 'broadly in line' with those 
forecast by Goodbody and ahead of predictions from Davy. 'The group's operating margin, at 4.0pc, was in line with 
our forecasts, as operating expenses of E28.8m were broadly in line with our expectations and slightly ahead of full

levels achieved prior to full year 2005, where the UK division was a drag on the group's performance.' Shares in 
Fyffes were unchanged on 1.12 despite Goodbody saying it was looking for 'a slight uptick in operating profits' in 
the year ahead. In a research note published today, analyst Liam Igoe mentioned that the company's operating

Highlight: Financial shares in Dublin took a tumble today on interest rate hike fears.
Body
Financial shares in Dublin took a tumble today after figures showed that the eurozone money supply rose to a 
record high in February, increasing the chances of further interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank.
The euro zone's M3 money supply is monitored by the ECB and seen as a guiding indicator of inflation. The figures 
were up 10pc year on year during February - the fastest growth rate since the introduction of the single currency 
and well ahead of market expectations.
The news had a negative effect on Ireland's banks, with AIB the biggest faller, down 22c to 22.22 and Bank of 
Ireland down 18c to 16.08. Anglo Irish Bank fell 9c to 16.17, while Irish Life and Permanent shed 8c to close at 
19.70.
 The sharp falls in the sector weighed heavy on the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares closing 
109.00 points lower at 9,269.64. Investor sentiment was also knocked by renewed fears of further interest rate 
hikes in the U.S. after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke issued a stark warning about inflation. He said that 
while core inflation slowed 'modestly' in the second half of 2006, recent readings remain 'uncomfortably high.' 
Stocks had rallied last week after interpreting language from the Fed as opening the way to the possibility of a 
reduction in interest rates. But concerns about stubborn inflation could upend investors' hopes for a reduction in 
rates, even if the U.S. economy continues to cool. Back in Dublin, trading in the construction sector was mainly 
lower, with Grafton down 24c to 11.27, McInerney down 12c to 15.58 and Kingspan down 11c to 19.98. However, 
CRH did manage modest gains, tacking on 11c to 31.50. Housebuilder Abbey was down 15c to 11.65. Other 
notable movers included drinks group CandC, down 19c to 11.29, food group IAWS, down 44c to 17.20, and 
bookmaker Paddy Power, down 2c to 19.70. Pharmaceutical group Elan was one of few major stocks to closed in 
the black, jumping 20c to 10.00. Both major airlines slipped back, with Aer Lingus falling 5c to 3.20 and Ryanair 
down 5c to 5.78, while media group UTV was unchanged at 6.15. Shares in bathroom fittings firm Qualceram 
Shires were notably lower as investors await the firm's full year results for 2006, due out tomorrow. In the interim

statement, issued in September, the company cited tough market conditions and high-energy prices as a negative 
drag on performance. Goodbody is forecasting a 3.4pc rise in turnover to E99.1m and earnings per share of 13.5c, 
up from 3.3c in 2005. However, analyst Dan Cavanagh cautioned that although this performance looks impressive, 
it should be noted that 2005 was a particularly poor year for the company.

Body
Air Berlin, Europe's third largest budget carrier, is to expand into the long-haul passenger business with the 
takeover of its loss-making German competitor LTU for about Euros 340m (Dollars 54m) including debt.
The group's second big decision since floating on the Frankfurt stock exchange last May is a sign chief executive 
and part-owner Joachim Hunold sees chances for Air Berlin as the industry consolidates.
It also shows Mr Hunold does not intend to copy bigger rivals Ryanair and Easyjet, focused on Europe: the LTU 
deal adds routes to New York and Las Vegas to a service he describes as "low-cost with frills".
Mr Hunold said AirBerlin's European network could feed passengers to LTU, with its hub in Dusseldorf and which 
flies to 79 cities worldwide. The link could save Euros 70-Euros 100m by 2008.
"We're becoming something in between a low-cost and a network carrier," Mr Hunold said of a group that started in 
charter and now says 60 per cent of clients book seat-only, compared with 40 per cent for LTU.
The possibility of cost cuts from the deal cheered investors, even though Air Berlin said it would dilute their holdings 
by issuing Euros 250m in new shares and a convertible bond to pay for the trans-action.
Air Berlin stock was trading 2.2 per cent higher at Euros 16.56 late yesterday in a flat market. The stock is up 40 per 
cent since last year's IPO.
The Berlin-based airline in August bought airline DBA from entrepreneur Hans Rudolf Wohrl, giving it vital landing 
rights at Munich airport, Germany's second biggest facility after Frankfurt.
That deal helped Air Berlin raise sales by 30 per cent to Euros 1.57bn last year. Operating earnings reached Euros 
64.1m.
Air Berlin buys LTU and heads for New York AIRLINES
Mr Wohrl bought loss-making DBA from its founder British Airways in 2003. He bought LTU three years later with 
an eye on merging the two - only to sell both assets in stages to rival Air Berlin.
In early March, he talked about merging LTU with Condor, a charter airline controlled by German retailer 
KarstadtQuelle. He said he opted for Air Berlin as it reacted quickly to the offer.
Air Berlin said it would offer joint flights with Condor, cancelling a code-sharing agreement with Tuifly, a charter and 
seat-only carrier owned by German tourism company Tui.
Tuifly said it would "not tolerate a possible monopoly" of Air Berlin, LTU and its ally, Condor. The German cartel 
office still has to approve both transactions.

Budget carrier Air Berlin PLC said Tuesday it bought German charter airline LTU for €140 million (US$186 million) 
in cash and will take a 49 percent stake in Switzerland's Belair Airlines AG as it moves to expand its business.
The acquisition of Duesseldorf-based LTU makes Air Berlin the fourth-largest airline for European traffic behind 
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Air France/KLM and Lufthansa, the company said.
"With the takeover of LTU we're following the wishes of the market," Air Berlin Chief Executive Joachim Hunold said 
in a statement. "Many of our customers ... have for years said we should offer long-haul flights we can now do that."
Air Berlin will assume between €190 million and €200 million (US$252 million and US$265 million) of LTU's debt. 
LTU will remain a legally independent company within the Air Berlin group, with its own management, and will retain 
its own name "in the foreseeable future," Air Berlin said.
The company did not disclose financial terms of its agreement to take the stake in Belair Airlines, a unit of the 
Hotelplan group.
"Air Berlin aims to increase its activities in the Swiss market," the company said.
Both deals are subject to regulatory approval.
Separately, the Berlin-based airline confirmed that it earned €50.1 million (US$66.46 million) in 2006 compared to a 
loss of €115.9 million in 2005.
Chief Financial Officer Ulf Huettmeyer said last year's results were not hampered by foreign exchange losses or 
taxes, as they were in 2005.
Sales rose nearly 30 percent to €1.57 billion (US$2.08 billion), driven in part from its acquisition of budget airline 
dba last year. Without the inclusion of dba, sales increased 16 percent to €1.4 billion (US$1.86 billion), Huettmeyer 
said.

Air Berlin also said it was changing its code share partner with the beginning of this summer's flight plan, with 
Condor replacing TUIfly. Condor, which belongs to the Thomas Cook travel group, operates 36 aircraft and carried 
7.8 million passengers in 2006.
The three companies Air Berlin, LTU and Condor will coordinate their flight plans and cross-sell tickets.
"Advantages for customers will arise from a broader service offering," Air Berlin said. "The three companies' aircraft 
will, for example, not anymore fly to the same destinations in parallel but at different days of the week."
Shares of Air Berlin rose 2 percent to €16.53 (US$21.97) in Frankfurt.
Commerzbank said the LTU deal significantly strengthens Air Berlin's presence in Duesseldorf and noted that the 
enlarged scale will allow cost savings, especially on items such as airport fees and catering. Dresdner Kleinwort 
said the acquisition came as a surprise but the synergies looked promising.

Highlight: Ryanair has slammed the decision to increase air traffic control fees by 12pc over the next 5 years.
Body
Ryanair has slammed the decision by the aviation regulator to allow the Irish Aviation Authority to increase air traffic 
control fees by an estimated 12pc over the next 5 years.
The airline, which itself has recently been criticised for hiking baggage fees by as much as 33pc, said this further 
increase in passenger costs will have a detrimental effect on the Irish economy.
It claims the increase in air traffic control fees will damage Irish tourism and make Ireland a more expensive 
destination for overseas visitors.
 In a statement today, the no-frills carrier said the decision had been taken by the regulator without consultation 
between the IAA and the user airlines who must pay for its services. "Like all the other ineffective regulators in this 
country, the Aviation Regulator has again signed off on unnecessary facilities and rewarded an inefficient state 
monopoly with big price increases while ignoring the views and inputs of the users who will have to pay for this 
regulatory failure," Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said. "Given the enormous increase in traffic which 
lower fares are delivering in Ireland at present, the cost per passenger should be falling, not rising. The Aviation 
Regulator is allowing both the airport and the ATC monopolies to build unnecessary gold-plated facilities and to pay 
for these with inflation busting price increases." Earlier this month, Ryanair was found to have raised its fees for 
checking in baggage by a third. The Consumers' Association of Ireland described the move as scandalous and 
accused Ryanair of extracting money from the public without them knowing it.

The Dublin market fell slightly lower this morning as sharp falls in Trinity Biotech countered a good start to the week 
for shares in Aer Lingus.
Just before midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 24.04 points to 9,488.82.
Shares in Trinity Biotech slumped almost 8pc in early trading today, as the diagnostics company awaits the FDA 
approval for its A1C test used in glucose control for diabetics. Shares were down 14c to 1.67.
 Those falls outweighed the strong start made by Aer Lingus, with the airline jumping 8c to 3.35 after the EU last 
week approved the new Open Skies agreement between the EU and the US. In the financial sector, AIB fell 14c to 
18.71, while Bank of Ireland slipped 18c to 16.48. Anglo Irish Bank made modest progress, up 10c to 16.35,

Financial shares weighed heavy on the Dublin market today as the ISEQ ended what had been a positive week on 
a low note.
AIB and Irish Life and Permanent were two biggest fallers in the sector, down 20c to 22.92 and 64c to 19.76 
respectively, while Bank of Ireland lost 17c to 16.63. Anglo Irish Bank managed to buck the trend, adding on 1c to 
16.26.
Those falls outweighed sharp gains in the likes of Aer Lingus and Elan, and dragged the overall ISEQ index of Irish 
shares 31.74 points lower to 9,512.86
 However, the index was still up more than 250 points on the week. Shares in Aer Lingus were again higher after 
EU Ministers approved the "Open Skies" agreement between Europe and the US on Thursday. The decision means 
that Aer Lingus and other airlines are now free to fly direct from anywhere in Europe to any destination in North 
America. The agreement was considered key to the former state airline's future growth plans. Aer Lingus 
responded almost immediately to the decision by announcing that it is to open three new routes to the US by the 
end of the year. The three new Aer Lingus routes are to San Francisco, Orlando and Washington, with the San 
Francisco service expected to start in October. Shares in the airline soared 12c to 3.27. Elsewhere, shares in 
pharmaceutical group Elan made steady progress, climbing 15c to 9.95, while FBD Holdings added on 45c to 38.20 
and Paddy Power tacked on 5c to 19.85. Trading was mixed in the construction sector, with Kingspan the most 
notable gainer, up 20c to 20.05. CRH dropped 11c to 31.82. Both McInerney and Grafton were also in the red,

a particularly poor year for the company. Shares in the firm were closed unchanged at 2.15. Ryanair was another 
notable mover, down 9c to 6.05, after it this week announced a new five-year hotel partnership with Expedia. 
Meanwhile, food group Kerry fell 5c to 20.80, with IAWS up 11c to 17.61 and housebuilder Abbey remained flat at

Michael O'Leary puts his feet up on his desk in his Dublin airport office and delivers his considered verdict on the 
job done by the European Union: "It has been the role of bureaucrats through the centuries to mess up markets," he 
says.
The Ryanair chief executive embodies the ambivalence shown by Europeans towards the EU. On the one hand 
they regard it as an infuriating bureaucracy; on the other hand they admit grudgingly that they do not want their 
country to leave.
If anyone should love the EU, it is Mr O'Leary. Brussels made possible his company's astonishing rise by breaking 
open cosy national aviation markets in the 1990s. Ryanair now challenges British Airways' claim to be the "world's 
favourite airline".
He admits that exposing national carriers to competition was a big achievement. "If the EU didn't exist, people 
would still be paying Euros 600 (Dollars 800, Pounds 405) for a one-hour flight, all across Europe." Such is the 
extent of this revolution that the combined cost to the Financial Times of Ryanair flights for researching this page - 
from Brussels to Carcassonne to Dublin to Brussels and from London to Riga return - came to Euros 296.58, taxes 
included.
Mr O'Leary has benefited personally from the liberalisation of air travel, lavishly extending his Gigginstown 
Georgian manor house and building stables for his horses. So what is his problem? "Now they're trying to re-
regulate - they haven't followed through on the principles of deregulation," he maintains.
He says Brussels wants to regulate airports - reducing competition - and that EU passenger compensation rules are 
"lunatic". He has described as "evil" attempts by the authorities to crack down on state aid to local airports, 
including the support given to lure Ryanair to the run-down Belgian steel town of Charleroi.
The European Commission of Jose Manuel Barroso is "hopeless" and he says he would vote No to a revival of the 
EU constitution, which he regards as "bloody nonsense".
Nevertheless, he adds: "I would be one of the strongest advocates of Ireland not leaving the EU." Membership gave 
Ireland new-found self-respect and allowed it to escape a history dominated by its troubled relations with Britain.
Brussels is accorded a reluctant embrace
He sees the EU having the same effect in the former Soviet satellites in central and eastern Europe, a group of 
mainly liberal countries that he expects will play a vital role in putting the bureaucrats to work in helping business 
succeed.

Nicola Horlick, the high-profile fund manager, left Societe Generale in 2004 to launch the boutique Bramdean Asset 
Management, which is primarily a fund of funds specialist. Two of her early recruits were Andrew Green and Rachel 
Durkin, with whom she had worked at Societe Generale.
Mr Green and Ms Durkin launched the Specialist UK Equity fund in October 2005, and since then it has beaten its 
benchmark by a wide margin. Mr Green says so far it has only been operating with Pounds 1m in seed money, 
acting as "a shop window for our skills". But Bramdean is about to start marketing the fund and increasing its assets 
under management now that it has established a convincing performance record. It will target independent financial 
advisers and institutional investors.
The fund has achieved a return of 31.4 per cent since its inception, compared with 22.7 per cent for the FTSE All-
Share index. The returns are more volatile than usual for a fund of its kind, since the strategy is based on "finding a 
maximum of 30 stocks that really excite us", says Ms Durkin.
Mr Green worked at Charterhouse Securities and Morley Fund Management before joining Societe Generale in 
1996. Ms Durkin joined Societe Generale in 1999 after graduating from Cambridge University.
Their investment approach is based on bottom-up analysis. They avoid taking bets on a particular sector. Mr Green 
says the portfolio has a slight bias towards growth stocks, where the share price includes a premium based on 
market expectations of rapid earnings growth.
"We've been big fans of EasyJet," says Mr Green. "We met the management, and we think there's a lot of growth 
left in low-cost airlines in Europe. But the only two business models that work are EasyJet and Ryanair." He says 
this is because the smaller low-cost carriers do not have the same economies of scale, meaning they have 
disadvantages such as a slower turnround of aircraft at airports. He says Easyjet - in which the fund still holds 
shares - should be able to expand at a rate of about15 per cent a year, compared with 5 per cent a year for the 
entire European low-cost airline sector.
Bramdean takes the field
Another successful investment has been Carphone Warehouse, which the fund has held since the company was 
launched in 2005. Ms Durkin says: "It has fantastic growth opportunities across Europe; it consistently exceeds 
expectations; and it is opening new shops". She believes press coverage of problems with its free broadband offer 
"missed the point".
A less successful investment has been Wolfson Microelectronics, which designs chips that convert digital data to 
audio such as music or mobile phone chatter. The company failed to penetrate the top tier of the mobile phone 
market, dominated by groups such as Nokia and Motorola. The fund sold its shares at a loss.
For retail investors, the fund's minimum investment is Pounds 25,000. There is no upfront fee. The annual 
management charge is a below-average 1.25 per cent. But there is a 20 per cent performance fee for returns in

Shares in British Airways rose slightly in London today after the announcement that a proposed deregulation accord 
with between the US and European governments has been agreed.
BA (BAY) and Virgin Atlantic called the deal a missed opportunity because they say it benefits US carriers but not 
European ones by failing to open up US markets to them.
(The deal) doesnt open up US markets so that European and British carriers can operate from one city to another, 
Paul Charles, a Virgin Atlantic executive, told the BBC today.
Crucially for BA, the effective date of the new accord has been pushed back by five months, to 30 March 2008, in 
part to give the airline time to prepare. BA gets about 60% of its revenue from trans-Atlantic flights.
Although the so-called open skies deal will remove protection British Airways has enjoyed for years on its trans-
Atlantic routes, the company benefited from some good news yesterday when chancellor Gordon Brown failed to 
levy a tax on airline tickets as some observers thought he might.
Shares in Dublin-based Ryanair Holdings (RYA), Europes largest discount airline, were also up today, by 2.3% to 
6.19p a share at 1:15 pm., while shares of its rival, Aer Lingus (AERL), climbed 0.085p or 2.7% to 3.2425p. The 
deal is seen as benefiting lean, no-frills carriers like Ryanair.
European transport ministers in Brussels had been expected to approve the open skies accord. It is aimed at 
sparking competition and encouraging mergers by allowing EU-member country airlines to make US flights from 
any of the unions airports, not just from airports in their home country, as had been the case. The signing of the 
deal is seen as good news for travellers, who are expected to benefit as more choice on routes causes fares to fall.
Most importantly for British Airways and Virgin, the deal also ends an arrangement that restricts travel between the 
US and Heathrow airport Europes busiest to BA, Virgin, American and United.
BA chief executive Willie Walsh, a critic of the open skies plan, today said the deal would deliver short term gains 
for the subsidised American aviation industry and said the UK government must stand by its promise to withdraw 
traffic rights to US carriers if the US does not deliver further liberalisation of its markets by 2010.
Nothing short of an open aviation area by 2010 will be acceptable, Walsh said in a statement, adding that he 
wanted talks on this second stage of the accord to begin immediately.
UK airline shares stay aloft as EU governments approve Open Skies
Aer Lingus took an opposing view.
'Aer Lingus has hailed todays ratification of the open skies agreement in Brussels, and has confirmed plans to 
commence three new long haul services to the US before the end of the year, it said in a statement.
It said its four new destinations would be San Francisco, Orlando and Washington Dulles, with the San Francisco 
route scheduled to begin in October.
Aer Lingus has waited a long time for this momentous day and to be able to fully exploit the potential to significantly 
grow long haul traffic between Ireland and the US, Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion said.

Body
Shares in Irish drinks group C and C soared more than 8pc today as investors breathed a sigh of relief after British 
Chancellor Gordon Brown announced that there would be no major rise in tax on cider in the UK.
It had been widely expected that Brown would raise the amount of tax paid on C and C's flagship product in the UK 
Budget, however, it he only raised prices by one pence. The news helped lift C and C's share price by 69c to 11.44.
Those gains outweighed falls in the financial sector and pushed the overall ISEQ index of Irish shares up 51.03 
points to 9,412.28.
 Bank of Ireland was hit hardest, down 45c to 16.70, after it issued a disappointing pre-close trading statement. The 
banks' forecast of underlying earnings per share of 144.4 for the full year to the end of March cent left investors 
somewhat underwhelmed. Goodbody said the forecast was marginally behind its estimate of 145.2 cent. The group 
will announce annual results at the end of May. Irish Life and Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank both fell into 
negative territory, down 40c to 19.70 and 5c to 16.12 respectively, while AIB bucked the trend, tacking on 16c to 
22.56. The shares slipped into the red ahead of this evening's interest rate decision in the US. The Federal Reserve 
is fully expected to leave interest rates unchanged, however, all attention is on the accompanying statement which 
could signal where interest rates are headed. Stocks on Wall Street fluctuated ahead of the decision with investors 
eager to learn whether the central bank will reveal a shift in its assessment of the US economy. The Fed has 
remained vigilant about the threat of inflation, which it has said remains stubbornly high. However, a softening 
economy could quell the threat of inflation and, some investors are hoping, open the way for a rate cut. The Fed left 
interest rates unchanged at its last five meetings after a string of 17 straight increases that began in 2004. Back in 
Dublin, CRH led the way in the construction sector, jumping 45c to 30.99, while Kingspan added on 50c to 19.41 
and McInerney climbed 57c to 15.12. Grafton ended the day 12c higher at 11.72. Aer Lingus was again in the black 
after the UK Government said on Tuesday that it would not oppose a new deal to open up flying rights between 
Europe and the US. The 'open Skies' agreement is seen as key to Aer Lingus' long term growth plans. Shares in 
ISEQ up 51pts as C&C shares soar 8pc
the former state airline closed 4c higher at 3.14. Meanwhile, shares in Ryanair were not affected by ongoing 
controversy surrounding its decision to increase baggage charges by 33pc, jumping an impressive 23c to 6.16. 
Shares in Irish Continental Group were down 5c to 20.10 after it was confirmed that Cork-based shipping company 
Doyle Group had bought a 1.3pc stake in the Irish Ferries parent. The shares have been the subject of frantic 
buying in recent days after it was confirmed last week that management at the firm had agreed a buy-out deal at a 
cost of E18.50 per share. Other notable movers included food group IAWS, up 25c to 17.32 and bookmaker Paddy 
Power, up 35c to 19.65.

A surge in shares in Aer Lingus amid hopes that the airline can benefit from a new Open Skies deal between the 
EU and US helped push the Dublin market out of the red.
At teh close, the ISEQ wasup 38.61 points to 9,361.25.
Shares in the airline jumped by almost 4pc or 11c to E3.10 after reports that British negotiators had signalled that 
they will not block a landmark EU Open Skies deal with the US that could open the way for Aer Lingus to greatly 
expand its services to the world's biggest market.
 The Irish airline has already jumped the gun slightly, saying that it plans to open a potentially very lucrative Ireland 
-San Francisco route immediately a deal is signed. Shares in Ryanair gained in tandem, with the stock up 25c to 
E5.90. Still in the transport sector, Irish Continental Group also helped lift the ISEQ in an otherwise lacklustre day's 
trading as investors continue to snap up the shares following the purchase by Philip Lynch's One51 investment 
group of 1.3 million shares in the ferries group. One51 bought the shares at E19.25 and E19.50 last Thursday and 
Friday. According to market sources, One51 clearly believes that another, better offer by ICG's chief executive, 
Philip Rothwell 's management team is a strong possibility. Even if it does not materialise, according to Stuart 
Draper of Dolmen Securities, 'the presence of a 19pc per annum 'junk bond' as part of Rothwell's offer adds upside 
to the shares'. The other strategic rational of the investment seems to be the fact that Dublin Port and One51 have 
a 50/50 joint venture in a new container and ro-ro terminal at Greenore, halfway between Dublin and Belfast. ICG 
shares jumped 30c to E20.15. Banks put in a decidedly mixed performance on the day with AIB shares up 8c to 
E22.45, Bank of Ireland declined 18c to E17.08, Anglo Irish fell by 15c to E16.15 and Irish Life and Permanent 
slumped by 22c to E20.18. Bank of Ireland is due to release its pre-close trading statement for its full year to the 
end of March this morning. Goodbody are forecasting 22pc earnings per share growth in the year to 145.2 cent on 
pre-tax profit growth of 22pc to E1,702m. The sector, while staging a partial recovery from last week's sharp fall, 
has yet to recover its previous sparkle with investors wary of another shock to the system from either the US

economy of from rising competition in the sector at home. Goodbody's chief economist, Dermot O'Leary, pointed 
out that this week's Federal Reserve meeting could see the US central bank giving equity and bond markets a 
much needed boost after a week of turmoil in the financial word triggered by a crisis in the sub-prime market in the 
US. Construction stocks put in a mixed performance with market leader, CRH, down 1c to E30.30 losing some 25 
cents in the course of the day as investors took profits. Grafton gained 1c to E11.55, Kingspan edged up 20c to 
E19.10 while McInerney rose by 5c to E14.75. Elsewhere, shares in outsourcing firm, Newcourt, gained 10c to

The Consumers Association has slammed what it called 'scandalous' charges for airline baggage handling.
The Irish Examiner reported this morning that over the weekend, Ryanair raised its baggage prices by 33pc to E12 
while Aer Lingus has imposed a 25pc hike in its online baggage charge to E5 and BMIbaby a 24pc rise.
Association chairman Michael Kilcoyne said the extra cost was one further example of the way in which the 
travelling public was being ripped off.
 He said the increases were huge when one considered the annual rate of increase in inflation was running at 5pc. 
Aer Lingus today defended its price hike, claiming that its Checked Baggage Charges are still amongst the lowest in 
the no-frills market. It said it has not recieved any negative feedback from customers since their introduction back in 
January. Ryanair has also defended its increase. The airline claims that it added its charges on 1 March this year 
and not over the weekend, as reported.

Raymond James upgrades Southwest Airlines on expectations of growing ancillary revenue

Shares of Southwest Airlines Co. moved higher Friday, after Raymond James upgraded its stock on expectations of 
growing revenue from sales of items other than airplane seats.
The Dallas-based low-cost carrier's shares added 10 cents to $14.99 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. It bucked an overall downward trend for airline stocks, as the Amex Airline Index dropped 1.1 percent 
due to rising crude oil prices and the effects of an East Coast snowstorm.
Raymond James analyst James D. Parker upgraded Southwest to "Outperform" from "Market Perform," writing in a 
research report that the company has great potential in marketing ancillary services, such as car rentals and hotels. 
It could also begin onboard sales of tickets for theater shows, museums or other items.
Such ancillary sales make up only about 2 percent of Southwest's revenue, compared with 15 percent for Europe's 
largest low-fare carrier, Ryanair, Parker wrote.
"Ancillary sales, we believe, are on the verge of becoming pervasive in the airline industry because it enables 
airlines to diversify their revenue bases away from the commodity pricing of airline seats and to take advantage of 
the leverage they have to sell higher margin items to captive audiences," he wrote.
Parker also cited Southwest's recent stock decline, saying it looks like a good company with its shares "on sale" 
after a 17 percent decline over the past nine months.

Airline stocks slipped Friday, as an East Coast snowstorm forced hundreds of cancellations.
Crude oil prices rose, offsetting a Raymond James upgrade of Southwest Airlines Co.
The Amex Airline Index fell nearly 1 percent, with nine of 11 components declining. A barrel of oil gained 21 cents to 
$57.76 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Jet fuel is one of an airline's top costs.
A late winter snowstorm forced cancellations across the Northeast. Among those grounding flights were JetBlue 
Airways Corp. and American Airlines. Most of the cancellations were in the New York area.
JetBlue shares slipped 16 cents to $11.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and American Airlines' parent, AMR Corp., 
fell 38 cents to $32.21 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The index's biggest gainer in early afternoon trading was Southwest, which added 10 cents at $15 on the NYSE.
Raymond James analyst James D. Parker upgraded the stock to "Outperform" from "Market Perform," saying the 
company has great potential in marketing ancillary services, such as car rentals, hotels and onboard sale of food, 
tickets for theater shows and other items.
Those sales, outside revenue from the actual plane ticket, make up only about 2 percent of Southwest's revenue, 
compared with 15 percent for Europe's largest low-fare carrier, Ryanair, Parker wrote in a report.
"Ancillary sales, we believe, are on the verge of becoming pervasive in the airline industry because it enables 
airlines to diversify their revenue bases away from the commodity pricing of airline seats and to take advantage of 
the leverage they have to sell higher margin items to captive audiences," he wrote.

The Dublin market was unchanged this morning as modest gains in C and C and Ryanair were wiped out by falls in 
the financial sector.
Just after 11.00, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 6.03 points to 9,170.92.
Drinks group C and C and Ryanair were the notable gainers early in the session, up 40c to 10.20 and 12c to 5.64 
respectively.
 However, those gains were outweighed by a sluggish start from the financials. AIB was the biggest faller, down 38c 
to 21.78, while Bank of Ireland fell 8c to 16.75 and Anglo Irish Bank slipped 2c to 16.05. Irish Life and Permanent 
was down 33c to 19.68. Elsewhere, food group IAWS was up 30c to 17.00, while CRH added on 17c to 30.04 and 
Smurfit Kappa fell 31c to 18.48.

Body
Shares in Dublin made a marginal recovery this morning following yesterday's massive falls which saw a total of 
E4.8bn wiped off the value of Irish equities.
Just after 1000, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 85.66 points to 9,146.60.
Yesterday's falls came after Wall St shares tumbled more than 2pc on Tuesday night, after fears spread across the 
whole financial sector over figures showing the sub-prime loans market in real trouble from defaulting borrowers.
 The latest blow to Irish and world markets came just over a week after a similar magnitude of decline in equities 
sparked by comments from Alan Greenspan, the former US Federal Reserve Chairman, that there was a real risk of 
a recession in the US and by a sharp correction in the Chinese stock market. The early morning charge today was 
led by the market's newest member - Smurfit Kappa. Shares in the paper and packaging firm climbed 45c to 18.00 
after it made its return to the stock market on Wednesday following a five-year hiatus. Elsewhere, shares in Paddy 
Power were up 34c to 19.00 as the bookies continue to enjoy favourable horse racing results at Cheltenham. In the 
financial sector, AIB was up 10c to 22.04, while Bank of Ireland added on 28c to 16.08. Anglo Irish Bank jumped 1c 
to 15.87, with Irish Life and Permanent up 35c to 20.34. Other notable movers included Ryanair, up 12c to 5.50, 
Grafton, up 34c to 11.53, and CRH, up 21c to 29.52.

Body
As much as E3 billion was wiped off the value of Irish equities this morning after a very weak session on Wall Street 
overnight amid fears on the US financial sector.
Just after 1000, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down almost 2.8pc, or 255.45 points, to 9,186.70. 
US indexes plunged overnight, with the Dow Jones sliding by more than 240 points, its second-biggest drop in 
almost four years, as troubles piled up for sub-prime lenders.
 All three major stock indexes on Wall Street were knocked down about 2pc. The repercussions continued in 
morning trade in Asia. The region's biggest bourse, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, saw its Nikkei 225 stock index 
close down 501.95 points at 16,676.89, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended the session 496.21 points 
lower at 18,836.93. Back in Dublin, it was the financials which bore the brunt of the falls, with AIB falling over 4.5pc, 
or 109c, to 22.31 and Irish Life and Permanent down over 3pc, or 72c, to 20.33. Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish 
Bank also slipped into the red, down 47c to 16.73 and 49c to 15.77 respectively. Construction shares fared little 
better in early deals. CRH was the biggest faller, down 102c to 30.08, while Grafton slipped 32c to 11.55, Kingspan 
fell 25c to 19.20 and McInerney lost 35c to 15.20. Other notable movers included recruitment group CPL 
Resources, down 33c to 7.20, pharmaceutical group Elan, down 30c to 9.40, and Ryanair, down 9c to 5.53. Smurfit 
Kappa, which joined the ISEQ today, was unchanged at 17.40.

Aer Lingus falls to a loss over pension and fuel costs, Ryanair bid
Aer Lingus falls to a loss over pension and fuel costs, Ryanair bid

Aer Lingus PLC, the target of a hostile bid by Ryanair last year, fell into the red in 2006 because of a pension fund 
shortfall, higher fuel prices and the cost of repelling the takeover, according to results published Tuesday.
Aer Lingus, which found itself under siege by Ryanair almost immediately after listing on the Irish and British stock 
exchanges in September, reported a net loss of €69.9 million (US$92 million) for the year ending Dec. 31, 
compared with a profit of €88.9 million in 2005.
Exceptional expenses included a €104 million (US$137 million) payment to top up the employees' pension fund and 
€16 million (US$21 million) to lawyers, stockbrokers and other advisers hired to thwart Ryanair's bid. Fuel costs 
also rose by 75 percent to €234 million (US$308 million).
Sales rose 11.3 percent to more than €1.1 billion (US$1.45 billion).
Finance Director Greg O'Sullivan said Aer Lingus was determined to expand its services to the United States in the 
coming year. The airline now flies to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles, but 
O'Sullivan said the next targets would be San Francisco and resuming service to Washington and Orlando, Florida.
Aer Lingus shut down its Washington services after the Sept. 11 attacks and canceled lucrative Orlando services in 
January 2006 because of a union dispute.
Aer Lingus is also planning an online ticket booking agreement with U.S. low-fare carrier Jet Blue Corp. that will let 
customers make one booking between Ireland and the U.S. and onto a Jet Blue flight to 51 places in Mexico, the 
U.S. and the Caribbean.
O'Sullivan said Aer Lingus was not depending on the framework deal announced this month between European 
Union and U.S. aviation authorities to open up trans-Atlantic competition. He said the Irish government was 
confident of negotiating a bilateral deal with U.S. aviation authorities even if the draft "open skies" deal wasn't 
ratified in Brussels and Washington.
Aer Lingus falls to a loss over pension and fuel costs, Ryanair bid
Aer Lingus carried more than 8.6 million passengers in 2006, up 7.3 percent. But the number of seats filled per 
flight fell to an average of 77.6 percent, off 3.8 percentage points, reflecting spotty sales on its route linking Dublin 
with the Gulf emirate of Dubai the first non-U.S. long-haul route Aer Lingus attempted.
The average short-haul fare rose 3.9 percent to €91 (US$120), the average long-haul fare 6.9 percent to €281 
(US$370).
Ryanair Holdings PLC remains publicly committed to taking over its Dublin-based rival if EU competition authorities 
approve of a merger, a decision expected in May or June. Ryanair has built up a 25.2 percent stake in Aer Lingus 
shares since launching its surprise bid Oct. 5 and says it wants to slash the carrier's 3,600-strong work force.
However, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has conceded that the chances of a takeover are slim, given 
that shareholders who have about 45 percent of Aer Lingus have rebuffed the bid. Those include the Irish 
government, which retained a 25 percent stake, trusts controlled by Aer Lingus pilots and other employees, and 
telecom tycoon Denis O'Brien.
O'Sullivan rejected accusations that the government sold off its majority stake in Aer Lingus too cheaply at €2.20 
(US$2.89) a share. The shares were trading above €3 (US$4) within two weeks of the Sept. 27 IPO following the 
Ryanair bid of €2.80 (US$3.69) a share.
"In any IPO pricing there's a discount, and the aviation sector has performed strongly since the IPO," he said.
Aer Lingus shares ended down 2 percent at €2.85 (US$3.75) on the Irish Stock Exchange.

Airport operator Fraport AG said Tuesday that February traffic increased at most of its airports, led by its biggest, 
Frankfurt International.
The company said that last month, 3.56 million passengers flew in and out of Europe's third-busiest airport after 
Heathrow and Charles de Gaulle an increase of 3.8 percent compared to February 2006. The airport, which is 
central hub for travelers going elsewhere in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Americas, reported 36,971 
takeoffs and landings, up 2.6 percent from a year ago.
Fraport said the increase in passengers was the result of more European traffic and intercontinental traffic, 
particularly on routes to North America and Asia.
Fraport said that its eight airports combined had 4.83 million passengers in February, up 8.6 percent. Frankfurt-
Hahn, a low-cost hub for Ryanair and others reported 262,602 passengers, up 16.8 percent from last year while 
309,096 passengers flew in and out of Hanover Airport, a rise of 1.9 percent. Passenger traffic was down half a 
percent at Fraport's Saarbruecken Airport to 18,158 passengers.
The Lima Airport in Peru counted 539,138 passengers, up 24.6 percent from last year, while its International 
Terminal One at Antalya Airport in Turkey saw a threefold increase in passengers to 134,129.
Its two Bulgarian airports, Bourgas and Varna, reported 578 passengers and 12,209, respectively.
Shares of Fraport rose 1.4 percent to €57.11 (US$75.13) in Frankfurt trading.

Body
Shares on the Dublin market tumbled over one percent today on the back of sharp falls in IAWS and Ryanair.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the session 98.62 points lower at 9,442.15.
Investor sentiment was hit by a negative start on Wall Street, with US stocks falling after retail sales came in weaker 
than anticipated, leading investors to brace for a wilting economy.
 Shares in food group IAWS were the day's biggest faller, down 47c to 17.15, on profit taking after it posted a 
13.3pc rise in profits to E56.04 million for the six months to the end of January earlier this week. Meanwhile, shares 
in Ryanair were down 8c to 5.68 after the airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, admitted on Monday that its 
proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus is 'rather unlikely' to succeed. Aer Lingus also closed in the red, down 5c to 2.85 
after it became the latest Irish firm to announce its full year results. The former state airline today announced a 
6.6pc drop in operating profits for 2006 to E76 million, but forecast double digit profit growth for 2007. The figures 
came in ahead of market consensus forecasts and were in-line with those predicted by Aer Lingus at the time of its 
IPO in October last year. Financial shares, which have performed strongly over the past month, slipped back with 
AIB down 16c to 23.40, Bank of Ireland down 21c to 17.20 and Anglo Irish Bank down 1c to 16.31. Irish Life and 
Permanent fell 50c to 21.05. Irish banks have performed strongly of late on the back of positive news-flow. Davy 
said Ireland's banking sector has been the best performing in Europe over the past month thanks to strong trading 
updates from AIB and Anglo Irish Bank. Meanwhile, as the Cheltenham festival got underway, bookmaker Paddy 
Power fell 32c to 18.75 on profit taking following last week's sharp gains. Shares in Independent News and Media 
were down 3c to 5.55 despite the release of figures in the UK showing that it's titles there maintained their 
circulation during February despite a general decline in the newspaper market. The latest audited sales data from 
ABC show that the UK version of the Independent enjoyed another year-on-year rise in circulation during February, 
up 0.3pc from January to 264,182. Those figures mark a 10.6pc rise on the sales recorded in December 2006. The 
ISEQ down 1pc on IAWS & Ryanair
rise takes the Independent's share of the quality newspaper market in the UK to 12.2pc - its highest level since 
October 1995. The recent deluge of trading updates shows no sign of a let up with several more firms set to publish 
their full year results in the coming days. Outsourcing group Newcourt is due to release its numbers on Tuesday 
next. Goodbody analyst Phillip O'Sullivan said he is expecting see solid progress across all areas of the business, 
with revenues up by around 55pc to E101.3 million and operating profits up 50pc to E9 million. He said the strong 
performance would be driven by "continued economic resilience, regulatory changes and cross selling benefits 
arising from seven acquisitions made during the year". Shares in Newcourt closed 3c lower at 1.75 in Dublin 
yesterday. Tullow Oil, Fyffes and Getmobile are also due to release their full year results before the end of March.

Body
The market has reacted favourably to the first set of results from Aer Lingus since its flotation on the stock market 
last October, despite the airline posting a drop in profits.
The airline this morning confirmed that operating profits during the 12-months to the end of December 2006 were 
down 6.6pc to E76 million.
However, shares in Aer Lingus were up 3c to 2.93 in Dublin this lunchtime.
 The drop in profits came despite an 11.3pc increase in total revenues to E1.115 billion. Aer Lingus said the figure 
was still better than it had signalled at the time of its flotation. Dolmen analyst Stuart Draper said the operating profit 
of E76 million was 4pc ahead of market consensus forecasts of E73 million. However, NCB analyst John Sheehan 
said the company's first results since its IPO were slightly below what he had been expecting. "The group's balance 
sheet is strong but the planned growth in fleet will need to convert into bottom-line earnings advances to drive the 
stock from here," he said. The airline itself has maintained its previous profit guidance for 2007 of double-digit 
growth in operating profit. It blamed the drop in profits during 2006 on high fuel costs and the effects of the terrorist 
alerts in the UK last summer. The airline also said it spent E16 million on advisors to defend itself against a hostile 
takeover bid from Ryanair. Operating costs at Aer Lingus rose by a massive 12.9pc to E1.039 billion in 2006. 
Industrial unrest at home and investment in its long-haul fleet also took their toll, the airline said. During the coming 
year, the airline said it will look to further increase profits from ancillary products such as excess baggage charges, 
car hire and sales on board its planes. Ancillary revenues grew by 34pc to E63.4 million during 2006, while ancillary 
revenues per customer increased by 25pc to E7.35. The airline said it has also availed of weaknesses in oil prices 
to increase its fuel hedging for 2007.

At 1330, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 76.71 points to 9,464.06.
Shares in Ryanair were down 13c to 5.65. The airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, yesterday told a German 
newspaper that its proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus is 'rather unlikely' to succeed.
 Meanwhile, shares in Aer Lingus kept their head above water, up 1c to 2.95, despite the recently-floated airline 
today posting a 6.6pc drop in profits for 2006 to E76 million. Elsewhere, shares in the financial sector struggled with 
AIB down 16c to 23.40, Bank of Ireland down 11c to 17.30 and Anglo Irish Bank 2c lower at 16.30. Irish Life and 
Permanent fell 45c to 21.10. Other notable movers included C and C, down 8c to 9.91, Elan, down 12c to 9.61, and 
CRH, down 37c to 31.24.

Irish airline Aer Lingus said its underlying operating profit fell by 6.6% last year as soaring fuel prices, a terrorist plot 
to blow up planes and costs associated with its IPO weighed on revenues.
The company will continue efforts to reduce costs and improve efficiency to win market share in an increasingly 
competitive environment, chief executive Dermot Mannion said in a statement.
Aer Lingus (AERL) has been fighting off a takeover effort by rival Ryanair Holdings, Dublins other major carrier, 
which happens to be Europes largest discount airline.
Aer Lingus, which first sold its shares to the public in September, said it plans to use the money from its IPO to buy 
new planes and resolve a long-standing pension funding issue with its staff.
In addition to our continuing focus on cost reduction in 2007, following a period of static capacity, we are investing 
in our long haul fleet, enabling us to expand our transatlantic services, Mannion said.
In this regard, we welcome the recent EU announcement that a draft Open Skies agreement has been reached with 
the US.
Ryanairs 1.48-billion hostile takeover attempt was withdrawn in December, pending a European Commission ruling 
on whether it would significantly reduce competition. Aer Lingus officials have repeatedly said they can serve the 
Aer Lingus shareholders interests best by remaining independent.
After taxes and other expenses, the Dublin-based carrier reported a loss in 2006 of 69.9 million, or 20 cents a 
share, compared with a profit last time of 88.9 million, or 31 cents.
Revenue rose to 1.12 billion from 921.3 billion in 2005, Aer Lingus said.
Underlying operating profit including 7.3 million for employee profit sharing fell to 76 million in 2006 from 81.4 million 
in 2005.
Passenger revenue grew by 9.7% to 997.9 million while passenger numbers rose 7.3% to 8.6 million. Average short 
haul and long haul fares rose, to 90.99 and 280.90 respectively, from 87.55 and 262.89.
Aer Lingus shares were little changed in London at midday at 2.915p each. At this price the airline has a market 
value of 1.55 billion.

Body
A sluggish Dublin market ended the day modestly lower today as falls in Aer Lingus and Ryanair outweighed gains 
in the financial sector.
Irish shares had traded in the black for much of the day, however, investor sentiment was knocked by a slow start 
on Wall Street.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the day 27.15 points lower at 9,540.77, well off session highs of 9,767.42.
 Shares in Aer Lingus were down 4c to 2.90 as the market prepared itself for the airline's full year results, due out 
tomorrow. Shares were knocked today by the news that long-haul passenger numbers and the key passenger load 
factor both fell in February. The airline reported that its long-haul numbers declined by 4.2pc to 68,000 while its 
short-haul numbers increased by 8.9pc to 548,000. Its crucial load factor for the entire airline was down 0.1pc in the 
month to 71.9pc while for the year to the end of February the factor is down 2pc to 68.9pc. Meanwhile, shares in 
Ryanair also took a tumble, down 19c to 5.78, after chief executive Michael O'Leary told a German magazine that 
its proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus is now 'rather unlikely' to succeed. Ryanair withdrew its E1.48 billion hostile 
takeover bid in December last year after the European Commission launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious 
competition concerns' over the proposed merger. 'We'll wait and see what conditions the Commission demands and 
then rethink this,' O'Leary said. He also said Ryanair is in talks with six airports in Germany to expand its flight 
network in the country and will likely start flying from southern Germany within the next two years. Those falls 
outweighed gains in the banking sector, where AIB was up 16c to 23.56, Bank of Ireland was up 3c to 17.41 and 
Irish Life and Permanent up 25c to 21.55. Anglo Irish Bank closed unchanged on 16.35. Shares in CandC ended 
the day 8c higher at 10.00 after the latest UK off-trade data from Neilsen showed that Magners' share in February 
was 3.5 times its level in the same month a year earlier. The cider's volumes in the UK during the month were up 
300pc year on year, with year on year growth in the overall cider market up 18pc. Magners' share of off-trade cider 
volumes in February was 6.7pc. Irish Continental Group closed 5c lower at 19.10 after it was confirmed that 
ISEQ down 27pts as airlines weigh heavy
Schroders has sold a total of 275,000 shares in the Irish Ferries owner at E19.21 each, cutting its stake to 0.957pc 
from 2.127pc. The asset management company now holds 225,000 shares in Irish Continental. The ferry company 
last week received a possible offer approach from its senior management team of E18.50 per share. Other notable 
movers included CRH, down 66c to 31.50, McInerney, up 27c to 15.67, and Paddy Power, down 43c to 19.07. 
Shares in food group IAWS fell 76c to 17.62 after it today announced a 13.3pc rise in profits to E56.04 million for 
the six months to the end of January. Meanwhile, shares in Irish travel software group Datalex added on 4c to 0.74 
despite the firm posting a drop in pre-tax profits to USD1.11m for 2006. Datalex took the number of Irish companies 
that have posted full year results for 2006 over recent weeks to 19. Of these, Davy Stockbrokers said that 16 have 
beat analyst forecasts, while only three have fallen short. "So far the 2006 outcome has, in aggregate, been more 
than 25pc up on 2005 and over 3pc ahead of final analyst estimates," Davy said. "These trend are carrying through 
to upgrades for 2007 and 2008. In aggregate, earnings estimates for these years have been upgraded by 3.9pc and 
3.4pc respectively."

Body
Ryanair's proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus is 'rather unlikely' to succeed, chief executive Michael O'Leary said in 
an interview with Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
Ryanair withdrew its E1.48 billion hostile takeover bid in December last year after the European Commission 
launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest 
airlines.
The Commission last month extended the deadline for its inquiry to June 13.
 'We'll wait and see what conditions the Commission demands and then rethink this,' O'Leary said 'But we don't 
think that anything will happen before the elections in Ireland,' he said. O'Leary's remarks appear to contrast with 
comments by Ryanair deputy chief executive Howard Millar last month in which he said there is 'a very good 
possibility' of a fresh bid for the Irish flag-carrier either immediately or in the next year if it gets the green light from 
the EU. O'Leary also said Ryanair is in talks with six airports in Germany to expand its flight network in the country 
and will likely start flying from southern Germany within the next two years. Two of the six German airports are in 
the southern part of the country, from where Ryanair could offer domestic flights to Berlin and Bremen, O'Leary 
said. He also said the company's request to receive access to Munich airport's Terminal 2, which is used only by 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG and its partner airlines, was denied in writing. The airport replied with 'two words: Go 
away,' O'Leary told the newspaper. 'But eventually they are going to realise that real growth lies with the budget 
airlines, and they will let us in.'

The Irish Hotels Federation has taken over E600,000 worth of bookings since it agreed an online partnership with 
Ryanair in January.
The short-term deal has seen a booking facility for the hotels group positioned on the Ryanair website over the last

The Federation said that over 2,700 bookings have been made via the facility during that time.
 The airline is currently looking to agree a permanent online partnership with an international hotel provider. It said

The sound of helicopter blades will be as familiar as the thunder of hooves at Cheltenham next week for the 
prestige event in horseracing, the four-day National Hunt festival.
Event organisers expect that, with good weather, more than 650 helicopter landings will bring in race-goers from 
far-flung destinations such as London, Ireland and Cornwall or from hotels around the Cotswolds, surpassing last 
year's total.
The festival, which boosts the wider economy by Pounds 50m, is all but certain to overtake Silverstone's Formula 1 
race as the premier sporting event for flying in spectators by helicopter.
Road links to the motor-racing circuit are being improved while Cheltenham's train and taxi services continue in a 
hopeless struggle to cope with the 230,000 spectators descending on the Gloucestershire town. About 70,000 will 
attend Friday's Gold Cup.
Footballers are among racegoers paying upwards of Pounds 750 a seat to be deposited on a field north of the 
racecourse. John Terry, the England captain, took a chopper-load of his Chelsea team-mates for a day out last 
year.
"Fearless" Freddie Williams, a bookmaker carjacked last year en route from the racecourse to his hotel and robbed 
of Pounds 100,000, is avoiding a recurrence by hiring a helicopter.
"We have seen a vast increase in helicopter use in the last couple of years," says Angela Goldsmith of Helicopter & 
Aviation Services, the racecourse's air traffic control. "At peak time we could be taking three helicopters a minute."
Helicopter services prove a winner at Cheltenham Traffic congestion has encouraged racegoers to choose a 
quicker means of travel, writes Roger Blitz
Most helicopters arrive before the start of each day's first race. Others are slotted in between races so as not to 
frighten the horses. If the ground is dry and they are not likely to sink into the mud, there is parking for about 110 
helicopters.
A popular way of getting to Cheltenham is via a helicopter shuttle for those frustrated in previous years by traffic 
between their hotels and the racecourse. Some 10,000 beds are filled each night in and around Cheltenham during 
the festival.
Last year 30,000 cars, 2,000 coaches and 50 stretch limos descended on Cheltenham, clogging the road network. 
Taxi services in Birmingham, Bristol and the east Midlands home in on Cheltenham with passengers picked up from 
the extra flights laid on by Ryanair from Ireland.
Severn Aviation, based at Gloucestershire Airport and set up this year by Peter Saunders, the food entrepreneur, 
has 125 helicopter landings to make for thefestival.
It sees a market in high net worth individuals wanting to fast-track their journeys to events such as the Grand 
National, the Goodwood festival, Royal Ascot and other race meetings, as well as polo tournaments and Cowes 
Week.
"But there is no single event quite as big as Cheltenham," says Gary Hodge of Severn Aviation.
PremiAir, one of a group of operators flying race-goers the 50 minutes from London, said the growth in the use of 
helicopters for sporting events correlated with increasing road congestion.
Robin Taylor-Hunt of PremiAir says high net worth individuals using helicopters to get to events were predominantly 
the owners of private companies.
"People from listed companies have this fear about how it is being perceived, unlike huge US companies who 
regularly fly people around in helicopters," Mr Taylor-Hunt says.
Those flying in from London tend to like to doso in style, he adds.
"You would be hiring the whole helicopter for the day for your friends. Some of the larger helicopters haveminibars."

Ryanair has upped the stakes in its battle with the Dublin Airport Authority over the proposed new terminal at Dublin 
Airport and said it will boycott it if the project goes ahead.
Ryanair told the DAA that, should its takeover attempt of Aer Lingus be successful, no Aer Lingus passengers will 
use the new facilities either.
Ryanair yesterday said it remains opposed to current "gold-plated" plans for the second terminal at Dublin airport.
 The airline said the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is "wasting money" by spending E609 million on the new 
terminal, when similar passenger facilities have been built elsewhere in Europe for a tenth of the cost. The budget 
carrier also claims that current plans will lead to passenger charges doubling at Dublin Airport from E5.50 currently 
to around E11.

Shares in Irish Continental Group soared almost 22pc today on the back of impressive 2006 results and news of a 
management buyout offer.
Those sharp gains were mirrored in the financial sector after the European Central Bank raised interest rates to 
3.75pc but hinted that they may not go much higher.
The momentum of those shares was enough to take the Dublin market back above the 9,500 level as its recovery 
from last week's worldwide equities slump continued.
 The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 243.46 points higher at 9,548.84. Shares in Irish Ferries owner ICG closed a 
massive 390c higher at 19.50 in Dublin, with just over 1.5 million shares changing hands after it said that pre-tax 
profits rose 30.3pc to E59.7 million last year. It attributed the strong performance in 2006 to lower costs and an 
increase in freight revenue. The company also announced that it had received a proposal from its chief executive 
and other senior members of its management team to buy out the company. An agreement has been reached 
between the two parties on an E18.50 per share offer, valuing the company at E471 million. The directors involved 
in the buy-out plan include chief executive Eamonn Rothwell, Gearoid O'Dea, Tony Kelly, John Reilly and Tom 
Corcoran. AIB was one of the star performers in the banking sector, jumping 76c to 23.04, while Bank of Ireland 
closed 40c higher at 17.40 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 13c to 20.73. Anglo Irish Bank closed an 
impressive 94c higher at 16.35 after it today forecast a massive 40pc surge in earnings per share in the first half of 
this year. Financial shares were buoyed by the words of ECB president Jean Claude Trichet after today's meeting 
in Frankfurt. Trichet altered some key catch phrases in his statements on monetary policy, saying that interest rates 
were 'moderate', instead of 'low', as they were previously described. However, he kept his view that policy remains 
'accommodative', that inflation risks remain to the upside, and that these would be monitored carefully. While the 
comments suggest more rate hikes may come, they also indicate that they may not go much higher than 4.0pc. 
'Describing ECB rates as 'moderate' 'is a give-away that rate policy is now reaching a cusp,' said David Brown at 
ISEQ closes up 243pts as ICG soars 22pc
Bear Stearns. Elsewhere in Dublin, shares in Kerry Group made good progress, up 74c to 21.45, while Ryanair 
jumped 16c to 5.81 and C&C added 24c to 10.22. Other notable movers included Aer Lingus, up 2c to 2.92, IAWS, 
up 53c to 17.82, and Paddy Power, up 1.10 to 19.80. Shares in the construction sector moved higher, with CRH up 
34c to 32.31, Grafton up 27c to 12.10 and McInerney up 13c to 15.48. Kingspan bucked the trend, slipping 2c to 
19.50. Investor sentiment in Dublin was boosted by solid gains on Wall Street and a recovery in bourses across 
Europe. All attention will now turn to tomorrow's US payrolls data, which are expected to show a 100,000 increase 
in February despite an ADP forecast for only 57,000.

Ryanair today said it remains opposed to current "gold-plated" plans for the second terminal at Dublin airport.
The airline said the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) is "wasting money" by spending E609 million on the new 
terminal, when similar passenger facilities have been built elsewhere in Europe for a tenth of the cost.
The budget carrier also claims that current plans will lead to passenger charges doubling at Dublin Airport from 
E5.50 currently to around E11.
 "The DAA monopoly should not be allowed to waste E609m building a 15 million passenger facility when Frankfurt 
Hahn can build a similar 15 million passenger terminal for just E60m," Ryanir said in a statement. "There would be 
no need for any increase in passenger charges at Dublin Airport if the DAA built a low cost efficient terminal, which 
is what its major airline users have already confirmed that they want to see developed. At a time when Aer Lingus, 
for example, is trying to reduce unit costs, the DAA is proposing to double them at Dublin Airport." The airline's 
outspoken chief executive, Michael O'Leary has warned that the DAA should not be trusted to build cost efficient 
terminals. "It is vital that the mess which the DAA have created at Cork Airport is not repeated at Dublin. In Cork, 
the DAA wasted E200m building a new terminal for just 3m passengers. This was 10 times more than the E20m 
which Cork's terminal should have cost. Now Cork Airport is stuck with a E200m debt, which it can never repay," he 
said. "Cork airport's terminal proves yet again that the DAA monopoly cannot be trusted to build cost efficient 
terminal facilities. It also proves that the Aviation Regulator is hopelessly unable to control the DAA monopoly. He's 
just a poodle, who rolls over every time the DAA wants to put up charges."

Body
The resurgence on the Dublin market continued today with AIB and Paddy Power leading the ISEQ over 100 points 
higher after both posted impressive trading updates earlier in the week.
The sharp rises in Dublin came despite speculation that the European Central Bank may signal further interest-rate 
increases when it meets tomorrow.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 120.36 points higher at 9,305.58.
 Investors in Dublin came off the sidelines to buy stocks that had languished last week. Less nervous dealers also 
moved in for shares in those firms which have recently issued buoyant trading updates. Few results have caught 
the eye more than AIB's. Tuesday's numbers revealed that the bank racked up profits of just over E2.6bn in 2006 - 
the biggest ever profit by an Irish commercial institution. Shares in the bank were up 43c to 22.28. Elsewhere in the 
financial sector, Bank of Ireland was up 27c to 17.0o, while Anglo Irish Bank added on 18c to 15.45. Shares in Irish 
Life and Permanent were up 10c to 20.60 after it last week posted operating profits of E529m for 2006, up 26pc on 
the previous year. Bookmaker Paddy Power was also a notable riser, up 54c to 18.34 after it this week posted 
pretax profits of E47.60m for last year, up 52pc on 2005 and comfortably ahead of analysts' expectations of 35pc 
growth. In the construction sector, shares in CRH closed 33c higher at 31.83 after it posted a 25pc rise in 2006 
profits to E1.6bn on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Grafton added on 3c to 5c to 11.83, with McInerney up 10c to 15.35 and 
Kingspan up 16c to 19.50. Housebuilder Abbey added on 17c to 11.55. Other notable movers included former state 
airline Aer Lingus, up 3c to 2.90, pharmaceutical group Elan, up 27c to 9.77, and food company Kerry Group, up 
27c to 20.72. No frills airline Ryanair made steady progress, jumping 13c to 5.65, while United Drug climbed 2c to 
3.90. Whether the resurgence witnessed on the ISEQ during the last two sessions continues will much depend on 
what the ECB says and does at its meeting in Frankfurt. Analysts are all but certain that the Bank will lift borrowing 
costs to 3.75pc from 3.5pc tomorrow, therefore, attention will focus on ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet's 
accompanying press conference for clues on the rate outlook in the coming months. 'The statement accompanying 
AIB & Paddy Power lead ISEQ up 120 pts
the decision and Mr Trichet's comments in the post meeting press conference will be gone through with a fine-tooth 
comb for any clues regarding the timing and extent of any further interest rate hikes,' said Howard Archer at Global 
Insight. Many in the market are expecting Trichet to drop hints that at least one further rate rise will be forthcoming 
in the coming months, possibly in June. Any comments suggesting the euro zone monetary policy remains 
accommodative, or concerns about medium-term inflationary pressures despite the recent benign euro zone 
inflation data will point to rates moving higher.

Tony Ryan, founder of Ryanair, has made a profits of E375,000 from the sale of shares in the airline.
In a note to the Irish Stock Exchange today, Mr Ryanair said he exercised 100,000 share options at E1.85 per 
share and sold them at a price of E5.60 per share.
While Mr Ryanair is still a director of the Irish airline, he has little day-to-day involvement in its running.
 However, he has not given up the business and is busy replicating Ryanair's highly successful model in the 
Americas. His Mexican airline Aerobus got off to a flying start last month, filling 85pc of its seats during its first two

Spirit Airlines to cut airfares, but charge for baggage, coffee, soda

Spirit Airlines said Tuesday it will take the unusual step of charging for all checked baggage and for drinks such as 
coffee and soda on flights starting in June, while also cutting fares by up to 40 percent.
The Miramar-based low-cost carrier that flies domestically and to Latin America and the Caribbean said it is cutting 
fares from 10 to 40 percent systemwide, and on last-minute fares as well.
Spirit also will charge for each checked bag for flights taking place June 20 or after, according to its Web site. 
Customers will still be allowed one carry-on bag for free, but one or two checked bags will cost $5 each if 
passengers make flight reservations on the carrier's Web site. The fee will be $10 each for one or two bags if 
passengers don't use the Web site for reservations. The charge is $100 for the third bag and on.
The airline currently allows one checked bag for free and $10 for a second checked bag.
Also starting June 20, soft drinks, juices, coffee and tea which are now free will cost $1. Water will still be free.
Most large U.S. carriers allow a carry-on bag and up to two or three checked bags at no additional charge per 
passenger. However, U.K.-based Ryanair charges a fee for each item of checked baggage, according to its Web 
site. Air Canada offers customers the option of saving $5 if they don't check any baggage.
With drinks, carriers usually charge for alcoholic beverages on domestic flights. But sodas, coffee and juice are 
usually free.
Bob Harrell, a travel consultant in New York, said airlines that cater to leisure travel such as Spirit often adjust fares, 
raising or lowering them 25 percent or more from one week to another in some cases. But airlines also are seeking 
ways to offset baggage handling costs, and lowering prices may be a way for Spirit to justify the move to charge for 
checked bags, Harrell said
"The baggage and the soda changes are new," said Harrell, of Harrell Associates. "If they're not exclusively new, 
then it's certainly unusual."
Spirit Airlines to cut airfares, but charge for baggage, coffee, soda
However, Harrell added that while it's possible that the major airlines would be looking at the success or failure of 
Spirit's changes, "You wouldn't see a lemming type of match from the larger carriers."
The move also reflects a strategy where services for baggage handling and beverages are "a la carte," or pay-as-
you-go, said Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst with R.W. Mann & Co. Inc. in Port Washington, N.Y.
At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Naomi Berger waited for a return flight to New York's Laguardia 
Airport. She said the airline told her of the $10 charge for a second checked bag by e-mail, and that she was OK 
with the extra charge because she paid $85 for her round trip ticket from New York to visit a relative in Miami Beach 
with her daughter and husband.
"If they keep the fares down, people use them," said Berger, who lives on Long Island.
But her husband, Robert Berger, was more critical of the charges. He said airlines are more interested in just 
getting travelers to their destinations and making short-term profits, rather than building a customer base by 
providing good service.
"Only an airline with no pride would charge you for a cup of soda," said Robert Berger, who is in the 
telecommunications business. "We'll pay them for the $10 for baggage and $1 for soda because we're still ahead of 
the game" on ticket prices, he said.
Spirit also plans to eliminate first-class service and free alcoholic drinks. The former first-class seats will be called 
"Big Front Seats" and sell at premium prices.
The airline is offering 1 cent fares, plus fees and taxes, to and from select cities in March, April and May. Customers 
have until Wednesday to book those flights.
Spirit, which is privately owned, offers service to 33 cities in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Spirit has hubs in Detroit and Fort Lauderdale. Its competitors include JetBlue, Northwest Airlines and Southwest 
Airlines.

CRH and AIB led the Dublin market over 1pc higher today as investors were encouraged by a recovery on world 
markets and moved to recoup some of the massive losses suffered in last week's sharp pullback.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 100.60 points higher at 9185.22, having languished in the previous five 
turbulent sessions.
Shares in the market's two heavy weights, AIB and CRH, moved sharply higher after they both posted strong profits 
for 2006.
 Ireland's largest bank AIB said that pre-tax profits during the year jumped 53pc to E2.615 billion - the biggest profit 
figure ever announced by an Irish commercial institution. The results were 3pc ahead of those forecast by Davy 
Stockbrokers. Shares closed 36c higher at 22.03. Meanwhile, building materials group CRH closed up 74c to 31.74 
on the back of its 25pc jump in full year profits. Elsewhere, Bank of Ireland was up 5c to 16.88, while Anglo Irish 
Bank climbed 8c to 15.28 and Irish Life and Permanent added on an impressive 29c to 20.63. In the construction 
sector, Grafton was up 60c to 11.80, while McInerney tacked on 15c to 15.30. Kingspan, which posted a 37pc rise 
in pre-tax profits to E1.46 billion during 2006 on Monday, closed 20c higher at 19.40, recovering some of the 
previous day's sharp losses. The building materials firm said it was benefiting from its increased focus on energy 
friendly products and European and Canadian businesses. However, the strong earnings were brushed off by 
investors as analysts raised concerns about the effects of rising raw materials prices and a slowdown in Irish 
house-building. Davy responded to the sharp falls in the share price on Monday by saying that the Kingspan story is 
every bit as strong as it was heading into the results. Bookmaker Paddy Power made steady progress, closing 70c 
higher at 17.85 after it announced a 52pc rise in profits to E47.6m during 2006, also on Monday. The bookies 
coffers were boosted during the year by a surge in internet betting and by favourable sporting results, particularly 
last summer's football World Cup. Clinical research group ICON ended the day 110c higher at 31.70 after it told 
investors in the US that it expects revenues to grow by USD1 billion by 2010. The firm said both organic growth and 
ISEQ up 100pts on AIB and CRH
acquisitions would drive growth. In the airline sector, no frills carrier Ryanair closed 7c higher at 5.56, while Aer 
Lingus jumped 8c to 2.88. Other notable movers included Kerry Group, up 6c to 20.37, drinks group C&C, up 42c to 
10.10, and IAWS, up 25c to 17.35. FBD Holdings, which is due to release its full year results tomorrow closed 45c 
higher at 40.05. Among the fallers, Trinity Biotech was down 4c to 5.22 after it reported revenues for 2006 up 
20.4pc to USD118.7m. The results came in short of Davy's forecast of a 24pc rise to USD121.8m. The diagnostics 
company said profit after tax, before an inventory write off, was up 42pc on the year to USD7.5m in the year.

Paddy Power has lived up to its punter-friendly image by announcing a 56 per cent jump in its total dividend.
That came on the back of a 58 per cent rise in pre- tax profits for the year to December 31.
Results at the Irish bookmaker were well ahead of brokers' forecasts.
Pre-tax profits rose from Euros 31.3m to Euros 49.7m on sales up 36 per cent at Euros 219m (Pounds 149m).
The results were helped by the company's decision to allow tax-free betting in its Irish shops and the continued 
strong performance of its online betting and gaming business.
The bookie's shop outlets saw an 18 per cent increase in money staked while there was a 23 per cent increase 
from those using the telephone betting service.
In the online business, the amounts staked increased 60 per cent with half of the business derived from the UK.
A total of 30 per cent of online revenues now come from online gaming rather than traditional sports betting.
Patrick Kennedy, chief executive, said the company was "positioned well for continued success in 2007 and 
beyond".
He said he was looking at acquiring licences in the Madrid area in Spain and the Basque region, where authorities 
are relaxing betting laws.
He was also closely following the Irish government's move to relax its gambling laws, after comments by Michael 
McDowell, the justice minister, last August that Dublin was considering moves to allow casinos in Ireland.
Mr Kennedy said he was also disappointed that Gold Cup victor War of Attrition, the horse owned by Michael 
O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, had pulled out of this month's Cheltenham premier national hunt race.
Paddy Power keeps backing winners and beats forecasts
However, Mr Kennedy announced the company was offering 6-to-1 odds that the week-long festival will beat last 
year's record 10 wins by Irish owners out of the 24 races.
A final dividend of 22.7 cents lifts the full-year pay-out to 32.2 cents to be paid from earnings per share of 81 cents, 
against 54 cents last time.
Shares in Paddy Power fell 1 cent to close at Euros 17.15.

No-frills airline, Ryanair, is to challenge in the courts a decision to bring in slot co-ordination into Dublin Airport.
Slot co-ordination, which give airlines allocated set times to operate services,replaces the previous system of 
airlines agreeing times among themselves.
The decision to make Dublin Airport coordinated was announced by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) 
last month.
 The CAR wants to introduce slot coordination from March 25 until late October to prevent more delays for 
passengers using Dublin Airport. If airlines do not keep to their landing and take-off slots they risk losing them 
altogether.

Sharp falls in Kingspan dragged the Dublin market lower today as last week's slump in global markets continued.
Shares in the building products company fell 7pc, or 140c, to 1920, despite the firm today posting a 37pc rise in full 
year pretax profit to E185.2 m.
Other shares in the construction sector also took a battering, with building materials group CRH down 79c to 30.70, 
Grafton down 46c to 11.34 and McInerney down 61c to 15.15. Housebuilder Abbey ended the day 55c lower at 
11.25.
 The sector weighed heavy on the overall market, with the ISEQ index of Irish shares closing 171.47 points lower at 
9,084.62. Share prices closed lower as nervousness over last week's plunge in global equities persisted, but came 
well off earlier lows as stocks on Wall Street opened higher. Investors remained jittery about a strengthening yen 
which climbed to three-month highs against the Euro and the U.S. Dollar. Financial shares also slipped into the red, 
with AIB falling 52c to 21.17, Bank of Ireland down 25c to 16.80 and Anglo Irish Bank down 20c to 15.20. 
Meanwhile, shares in Irish Life and Permanent fell further, down 32c to 20.34, despite the firm last week posting an 
18pc rise in profits in 2006 and forecasting further growth for the year ahead. Other notable fallers included drinks 
group CandC, down 40c to 9.65, food company Kerry Group, down 19c to 20.31, and exploration company Tullow 
Oil, down 27c to 5.18. No Frills airline Ryanair ended the session 16c lower at 5.49 after it confirmed that it has 
applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the Commission for Aviation Regulation's recent decision to impose 
full slot co-ordination at Dublin Airport. "By needlessly imposing co-ordination at Dublin Airport, the Regulator is 
allowing the monopoly airport operator to restrict capacity and increase prices. This is exactly what this Regulator is 
supposed to prevent,' said the airline. Shares in concrete firm Readymix restricted losses to 4c, down to 2.84, after 
it announced a strong set of results on Friday last. The group made profits of E42.6m for last year, up 32pc on 
2005. The impressive figures prompted Goodbody to raise their forecasts for Readymix and upgrade the shares 
ISEQ down 170 points on Kingspan
from "reduce" to "add". Analyst, Peter Gunne, said this was predominantly driven by margin improvement across 
the business. "For 2007, we have raised our earnings by 29pc to 18.5c, from 14.3c previously. For 2008, we have 
moved from 14.8c to 20.2c, up 36pc," he said. "We believe the impressive improvement in operating margin seen 
during 2006 (up 48pc to 8pc), will be sustained this year, as management continues to focus on operational 
efficiency. Also the shift in Irish construction from housebuilding towards infrastructure will benefit the group, as 
increased demand for aggregates will be stimulated." Elsewhere, Aer Lingus shed 5cto 2.80 as it prepares to 
release its full year results next week, while Irish Continental Group slipped 55c to 15.25. Trinity Biotech fell 8c to 
1.84.

Body
No- frills airline Ryanair, today confirmed that it had applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the 
Commission for Aviation Regulation's (CAR's) recent decision to impose full slot co-ordination at Dublin Airport. 
"This is the second time that Ryanair has been forced to resort to the courts to prevent this Regulator from limiting 
growth and promoting inefficiency at Dublin Airport," the airline said. 
Last year, Ryanair had a similar decision by the CAR overturned by the High Court where the Court found that the 
CAR had failed to follow the required steps proscribed by the European Regulation on slot coordination. 
 Commenting today, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs, Jim Callaghan, said, "This is a further indication that the 
CAR is not serious about regulating the Dublin Airport monopoly. The fact that Dublin Airport already has two 
runways and is only handling 20 million passengers per annum whereas Gatwick is handling 40 million on one 
runway makes this latest decision a complete nonsense. "DAA and its predecessor, Aer Rianta, have been 
attempting for the past 7 years to get full coordination at Dublin Airport because it restricts capacity so that they can 
build further gold plated facilities and massively increase prices for consumers. Prices in Dublin Airport are set to 
double if the DAA is allowed to pursue its E2 billion investment and sadly this ineffective Regulator shows no 
appetite for regulating this inefficient, high cost monopoly. Airlines are either ignored or forced to resort to legal 
action. "The mess in Cork airport and the DAA's plans to waste another E750 million white elephant second 
terminal in Dublin are clear indications that airport regulation has failed in Ireland."

From Mr Adam Goldthorp.
Sir, I totally agree with John Gapper's article "Be blunt if you want but keep it cheap" (February 26) until the final 
paragraph. Michael O'Leary and Ryanair do keep fares to a minimum but hit you with a series of charges. The cut-
price fare that attracted you bears little relation to price finally paid.
First, tax is added, perhaps acceptable but other budget airlines are less subtle. Next, a charge is automatically 
added for travel insurance. Last you are quizzed about how many bags you would like to check in. A charge is paid 
for each bag. If you arrive at the airport with more bags than stated you will pay a higher price for checking. 
Furthermore, any amendments to your booking will also incur charges.
A perk we had until recently was to check in online and be treated like royalty. You boarded before women and 
children. I was naive to think Mr O'Leary would miss this trick; booking a flight today I pay for the honour. I was 
alarmed to learn that some US airlines charge for aisle seating. Currently, Ryanair offers free seating, but following 
its policy of charging for everything, this could be next.
All said and done, the final price is still cheap, and all budget airlines should be commended for the way they 
change our flying habits, making destinations more accessible. However, navigating the maze of questions and 
charges puts me off Ryanair.

New proposals to end industrial unrest at Aer Lingus are due out today from the Labour Court.
Industrial action at the airline was put on hold to allow the court to look at the issues behind the unrest.
The airline also agreed to posptone the introduction of new contracts that cut overtime and holiday pay for staff.
 Aer Lingus says that the changes are needed to help it compete with low cost carriers such as Ryanair. However, 
unions reply that the changes break promises before the privatisation of the airline that the terms and conditions of

EU delays  Ryanair-Aer  Lingus bid ruling  until June  
The European Commission  (EC) has extended to June 13  its self-imposed deadline to  rule on Ryanair Holdings'  
$1.9 billion hostile takeover of  Irish carrier Aer Lingus. No  reason for the ruling has been  disclosed. The decision 
was to  have been handed down on  May 11.  
The EC has undertaken an  antitrust investigation into the  deal, citing serious competition  concerns with the 
acquisition. Ryanair had initially  withdrawn its takeover bid in  December, when the EC first  launched its 
investigation, but  recently expressed an interest  in renewing its bid once the  EC investigation concluded.  
US Airways chief  executive jailed  for one day  
Doug Parker, the chief executive  officer of US Airways, has  been ordered to spend 24  hours in jail after pleading  
guilty to intoxicated driving in  the US state of Arizona in  January. He was also ordered  to pay $1,646.25 in fines, 
and  to attend a doctor's appointment  to determine whether he  has an alcohol problem.  
Delta closer  toward  bankruptcy exit  
In a major step toward Delta  Air Lines' exit from bankruptcy  protection, the United States  Bankruptcy Court for 
the  Southern District of New York  has approved a disclosure statement  that will be sent to creditors  of Delta Air 
Lines Inc  along with the company's reorganization  plan. The carrier  plans to exit bankruptcy as soon  as late-
April . 
The decision allows the carrier  to start soliciting votes for  its plan to emerge as a standalone  company worth 
between  $9.4 billion and $12 billion.  The carrier's creditors' committee  has approved the terms of  the $2.5 billion 
in financing  that Delta has secured to  emerge from bankruptcy protection.  The court has also  granted Delta Air 
Lines  authorization to proceed with  the purchase of 30 CRJ900  aircraft from Bombardier  Aerospace. The deal is 
valued  at more than $1 billion; if all  options are exercised. 
AirTran denied list of MidWest shareholders  
The commercial division of the New York County Supreme Court has dismissed an injunction filed by AirTran to 
obtain a list of Midwest Airlines' shareholders. The carrier is the target of a hostile takeover by AirTran. The court's 
Legal news in brief
decision rests on the lack of jurisdiction - it concludes that AirTran does not do business in New York State, which 
would otherwise make it privy to regulations that would require such disclosure.  
AirTran counsel has stated that the decision is a technicality, and the carrier plans to pursue the matter 
either through appeal or a different venue.  
PIA ordered to recall 'dull' and 'over-weight' women crew  
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered that Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC), parent of 
Pakistani flag-carrier Pakistan International Airlines, recall immediately 73 of its women crew members suspended 
for being "overweight" and of "dull appearance". The court called the carrier's conduct "derogatory" and "insulting", 
insofar as it forced the women to retire because of their having "dull and poor appearance, scars on the face, gap in 
front teeth and the age factor affecting their looks".  
Bankruptcy court orders return of Varig slots  
The Commercial Bankruptcy and Reorganization Court of Rio de Janeiro has ordered Brazilian civil aviation 
regulator Anac to return a number of Brazilian flag-carrier Varig's slots at São Paulo Congonhas Airport. The 
decision was handed down one day after Anac cancelled the slots. Anac had cancelled 119 of Varig's routes 
involving 22 slots at Congonhas because of underutilization of some routes, despite the carrier being granted a full 
operational license. Varig says it intends boosting operations on the routes in conjunction with its fleet renewal, 
which is in progress. The court stressed that Anac is free to redistribute routes that Varig is not interested 
in operating.  
FAA proposes pilot retirement age of 65  
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has introduced proposed regulatory amendments that would 
allow commercial airline pilots to operate flights until the age of 65, rather than the mandatory retirement age of 
60. The amendments would nevertheless require that at least one member of a flight crew be under 60. The FAA's 
proposal mirrors a rule adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Since the international 
standard changed, foreign pilots have been able to fly in the US up to age 65.

ING Wholesale, a division of ING Group, has closed the fourth tranche of a euro-denominated aircraft financing for 
nine 737-8AS-passenger aircraft, equipped with CFM engines, for Ryanair, the European low-fare airline. The 
financing was successfully closed on January 23, coinciding with the first aircraft delivery. 
Eight additional aircraft will be delivered to Ryanair through March 2007. The financing, arranged by ING 
Wholesale's New York-based structured export finance group, is structured as a series of loans guaranteed by Ex-
Im Bank to finance 85% of the net purchase price of the aircraft. ING Wholesale is the sole arranger and lender. 
ING Wholesale arranged three previous Ex-Im Bank tranches for Ryanair, which were used to finance 17 737-800-
passenger aircraft, which were delivered between September 2005 and March 2006. 
Terina Golfinos, head of ING Wholesale's structured export finance for the Americas, says: "ING is delighted to 
continue its close collaboration with Ryanair on its multitranche Ex-Im Bank-guaranteed aircraft financing, which 
allows the airline to continue its strategic and rapid expansion as Europe's largest and most successful low-fare 
carrier." 
James Dempsey, Ryanair's treasurer, adds: "We look forward to building on the strong foundations laid by ING 
Wholesale's structured export finance department as we continue our fleet purchase programme with Boeing over 
the coming years."

Highlight: Nearly a year after their first interview with Airfinance Journal, the chief executive officers of SkyEurope 
and Wizz Air speak to Natasha Yazdabadi about growth in the central and east European market and the 
challenges ahead.
Body
It has been nine months since Airfinance Journal first spoke to Jozsef Varadi, chief executive officer of Wizz Air, 
and Christian Mandl, chief executive officer of SkyEurope, and neither man has any major apprehensions when it 
comes to their low-cost business models in the central and east European market. 
SkyEurope has its primary base in Slovakia where it is the largest national carrier. In 2006, Slovakia reached an 
economic growth rate of 8.2%, the highest among members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) and the third highest in the EU (just behind Estonia and Latvia). It is no surprise that Mandl 
maintains a bullish attitude towards the low-cost carrier market in the region. 
"There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic on the revenue side. We have chosen a region, which is enjoying very 
strong economic growth at the moment. There have been some changes in the environment worldwide. Fuel prices 
went down for European carriers and the euro has strengthened against the dollar. There are a lot of reasons to be 
optimistic on the cost side as well," says Mandl. 
Alain Skowronek, SkyEurope's chairman, adds: "We have a 50% market share in Slovakia and have discovered 
that it has been a real advantage having our first base here. Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic in 
January 1993, Slovakia was the only country in the world with no airlines. 
"There was a gap in the market where the Slovaks were not able to fly directly from their own capital [Bratislava]. 
They were forced to fly one hour away out of Vienna. We saw a chance to not only serve the Slovak market but 
also transform Bratislava into a secondary airport to Vienna. We are the largest airline at Bratislava Airport." Varadi 
is also upbeat about the low-cost carrier market in the region and is pleased with the way central and east 
Europeans are responding to cheap flights. 
"We are still as bullish as we were a year ago. The region is being very receptive to our business model. We are 
seeing that people, who have never travelled on a plane before and who have previously chosen another mode of 
transportation, such as coach, train and driving, have now converted to flying. The aviation sector in the region is 
driven by the development of the low-cost carrier industry." 
The bold and the bullish
Internet 
How do other low-cost carriers, such as easyJet and Ryanair, feel about central and eastern Europe? A spokesman 
at easyJet says: "We are committed to the area and while demand is strong, internet and credit card penetration 
needs to develop further to support additional expansion." Although Skowronek and Mandl would agree, they are 
still one step ahead and have a solution for the slower development of internet transactions in central and eastern 
Europe. 
A SkyEurope passenger can book at ticket through a call centre and then make a cash deposit into the airline's 
account. This transaction is faster than a credit card transaction, because payment is made in real time. SkyEurope 
has also introduced a method by which the passengers can pay with their mobile phones and receive confirmation 
of their flight as well. 
Skowronek says: "We are selling 90% [of flights] via internet in western Europe compared to roughly 60% in central 
and eastern Europe. However, we have a competitive advantage with our call centre and other payment facilities." 
Varadi is not as sceptical about internet usage in the region and explains that it is a misconception that the internet 
is not widely used. Although he agrees it is not as highly used as in western Europe, Varadi says that 20% to 25% 
of homes in central and eastern Europe are equipped with the internet. 
"People may not use the internet much in their homes," he says, "but those who have the internet at work can figure 
out ways to purchase their tickets "We are selling 90% [of flights] via internet in western Europe compared to 
roughly 60% in central and eastern Europe. However, we have a competitive advantage with our call centre and 
other payment facilities" there. Interestingly what we are seeing is the booking profile on the eastern market is very 
concentrated on the work hours as opposed to the rest of Europe, who are booking more in the evening." 
Varadi says Wizz Air's main competition remains thenon-flying transport industries - coaches and trains
 Competition 
Varadi and Mandl refused to acknowledge each other as competition nine months ago - both claimed they were the 
largest carrier in central and eastern Europe in May 2006. Nothing has really changed - yet. However, with the 
steady growth of these airlines and the increasing number of routes they will undertake, their paths are bound to 
clash eventually. So far the airlines only compete on two major routes and, according to Mandl, only in the summer. 
The routes are from Budapest to Bulgaria, Croatia and Greece. 
Mandl says: "There is little overlap between our networks. I have to credit Wizz Air, because they are bigger than us 
in Poland, but we have a strong presence in Slovakia. We are the largest low-cost carrier in the Czech Republic 
and Austria. According to The Hungarian Statistical Office, we are larger in Budapest than Wizz Air." 
Varadi also says that Wizz Air is the largest low-cost airline in Hungary with 28% market share. When contacted, 
The Hungarian Statistical Office was unable to provide statistics for 2006. However in 2005 Wizz Air carried 61,313 
more passengers than SkyEurope in Budapest. In the whole of Hungary in 2005, easyJet was the most successful 
low-cost carrier with passenger traffic of 695,870, followed by Wizz Air and then SkyEurope. 
Varadi says Wizz Air's main competition remains the non-flying transport industries - coaches and trains. Earlier this 
year Ernst & Young named the airline, which has carried more than six million passengers since its launch in 2004, 
Innovator of the Year in Hungary. 
Low cost or not 
When it comes to successful low-cost carrier business models, Varadi believes that Wizz Air is unique. "We are an 
airline that believes in delivering business at the lowest possible cost," he says. "I think easyJet has penetrated the 
central and eastern European market to an extent, but they find it difficult to cover their costs in this market." 
Mandl holds the business models of Ryanair and easyJet in high regard. He says: "The business model of Ryanair 
is to fly to secondary airports and easyJet's is to fly to convenient airports. They are both successful low-cost 
The bold and the bullish
carriers. Ryanair has lower costs than easyJet, but easyJet has higher revenues. At the end of the day what really 
matters is the margin you are able to achieve. SkyEurope's cost structure is already lower than easyJet's. However, 
easyJet benefits from being on a larger scale than us with 100 fuel-efficient aircraft." 
Growing fleet 
Boeing estimates that central and east European markets will require 510 new aircraft worth $37 billion over the 
next 20 years. Single-aisle aircraft account for 77% of all commercial jetliners delivered to the region's airlines. Only 
14% of aircraft delivered will be twin-aisle and 9% will be small regional jets. 
"The central and eastern European market is growing strongly," says Samantha Solomon, spokeswoman for 
Boeing. Low-cost carriers have gained a strong foothold in this market. Lower costs for labour and maintenance, 
together with a high skills base and labour availability make this an attractive base to operate the low-cost airline 
business model. The increasing migration of labour between central and eastern Europe and western Europe 
creates an additional impetus for low-cost air travel in addition to the traditional sources of business and VFR 
[visiting friends and relatives] travel." 
SkyEurope plans to reduce its costs by 5% through the renewal of its fleet. The carrier is also aiming for a unified 
fleet of 32 737s by 2010. 
Skowronek says: "We are fanatical about lowering our costs. Operating new aircraft enables you to fly more hours, 
resulting in higher productivity. Maintenance for new aircraft is 15% lower than for old aircraft. New aircraft also 
burn 12% less fuel than older aircraft." 
SkyEurope Airlines leased its first Boeing aircraft in 2000. The airline placed an order for up to 32 Boeing next-
generation 737s in 2005. The order comprised 16 firm orders (of which 12 were ordered through GE Commercial 
Aviation Services and four directly from Boeing) and 16 purchase rights. The carrier converted purchase rights for 
five Boeing 737-700NGs into orders in June 2006. The airline has 21 aircraft on order. Eight 737NG aircraft have 
been delivered, with further deliveries continuing through 2008. 
Privately owned Wizz Air has a unified Airbus fleet with plans for 53 A320 aircraft by 2012. Chris Buckley, executive 
vice-president of Europe and Latin America at Airbus, is excited by the growth of aviation in central and eastern 
Europe. He says: "From our perspective Wizz Air is doing pretty well. On record they have the lowest cost base, 
which they share with Ryanair. They have a great niche market and a great future ahead of them." 
View from the banks 
Bank of Scotland closed the predelivery payment facility of five 737-700s for SkyEurope Airlines in February. This 
was the first time that the listed airline has tapped the bank market. The bank says: "SkyEurope had a successful 
IPO and they have more capital going. We are comfortable with their management and their strategic plan. As an 
asset finance team we are comfortable with their choice of Boeing 737-700 aircraft. There are plenty of airlines who 
will buy or lease these workhorses." 
Not all banks would agree that low-cost carriers have a bright future. A Hamburg-based bank's spokesman says: "I 
doubt whether these new low-cost carriers can survive in the next five years, because they have a lot of 
competition. I have a problem with the low-cost carrier models in general. They have to pay fuel surcharges, landing 
fees and pilot salaries. They can only offset provisional costs such as travel agents by the ability to book via the 
internet. They are not necessarily low cost, but low share." 
Another German bank spokesman says that Wizz Air and SkyEurope are still quite young and they "are not as 
developed as easyJet and Ryanair, but they could be regarded as competition one day. The question is, which of 
the low-cost carriers will survive? Compared to the bigger western local carriers, they are less likely to survive". 
Obstacles 
The bold and the bullish
Varadi, Mandl and Skowronek are not blind to the obstacles ahead of them in the next decade. Varadi points out 
that the biggest challenges are those that will also affect his competition. "For example," he says, "potential stricter 
regulations on certain areas [the environment] and macroeconomic factors such as fuel price or exchange rate 
development." 
Skowronek identifies two main obstacles in the next two years. "These are credit card penetration and the fact that 
several airports are not privatized. Firstly, we have to find new ways of collecting money but we still have to be 
creative if we want to stimulate impulse buying. Secondly, Prague airport only has one runway. Bratislava airport's 
terminal is also a little congested. We need an adequate infrastructure to be able to offer the service we want to." 
Breaking barriers 
Looking to the future, SkyEurope plans to enter the Russian market. However, authorization to fly into the non-EU 
country is still linked to bilateral agreements between countries. Skowronek says: "We are interested in the Russian 
market. We are working on attaining the authorization to operate our flights there. It is a regulatory issue that we are 
trying to address." 
Wizz Air will concentrate solely on the central and east European market. The carrier is also applying to fly to 
Croatia, subject to regulatory discretion. "We have plans to open up markets beyond the European Union, but it is 
too early to reveal any plans," says Varadi. Wizz Air is expecting a growth rate of 40% to 50% in the next three to 
five years.

 Talks between Aeroflot and Boeing appear to have been put on hold. Aeroflot has asked the Russian government 
for permission to purchase 22 787 aircraft but so far it has not been granted. The value of the order is about $2.5 
billion. BAE Systems' operating profits have increased to £1.05 billion ($2.06 billion) for the year 2006. Company 
sales increased in 2006 by 9% to £13.7 billion ($26.83 billion) from £12.5 billion ($24.48 billion) in 2005. The Indian 
government has approved the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. 
The new merged airline will simply be known as Indian. The merger process will begin on April 1 and take two years 
to complete. The European Commission has extended the deadline for Ryanair's bid to take over Aer Lingus from 
May 11 to June 13. Ryanair made an offer for the Irish national airline last year. Ryanair's offer price per share is 
Eu2.80 ($3.67), valuing Aer Lingus at Eu1.48 billion. There appears to be opposition at the highest government 
level to the proposed takeover of Qantas by Airline Partners Australia.Major shareholders opposed to the bid could 
stop any takeover if they gain enough support, which is increasing. Another major shareholder, UBS Global Asset 
Management, also believes the bid undervalues the company. The Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) is in talks with 
Eads, parent company of Airbus, with a view to purchase up to 10% of Eads. The QIA is a $40 billion investment  
fund. JAL will purchase Embraer  regional jets for operation by   J-Air, the group's 100%-  owned regional airline 
subsidiary.  The airline group will  order 10 Embraer 170s and  take out an option on a further  five aircraft. The 
aircraft  will be delivered starting in  2008. British Airways has ordered four A320s as replacements for aircraft the 
airline recently retired. The airline has 14 A320s on firm order. SR Technics and Vueling Airlines of Spain have 
signed a maintenance contract for the CFM56 engines that power the airline's 16 A320s. The contract is for 12 
years, with a further possible extension of another six or 12 years. The contract will also cover any future A320 
aircraft delivered to the airline. Eastern Airways has begun using the Jetstream 41 simulator at the airline's base 
at Humberside Airport in the UK. The simulator is a joint venture with Pan Am International Flight Academy and will 
enable the airline to train pilots in-house and offer simulator training to other Jetstream 41 operators around the 
world. Boeing has confirmed an order for an additional 787 from Polish airline LOT, bringing the total number 
of orders for this aircraft to eight. The value of the aircraft is$153  million. LOT is due to receive its first 787 
Dreamliner in 2008.Air New Zealand has ordered a further four 787-9 Dreamliners, taking its total orders for the 
type to eight. The value of the order is about $700 million. The airline will receive its first 787 in 2010. Boeing 
delivered the first 737-700ER aircraft to All Nippon Airways. The Japanese carrier plans to introduce the model in 
March on the new service to Guangzhou in China on ANA BusinessJet. Russian national airline Aeroflot is to retire 
its remaining fleet of Tu-134 aircraft from service. Many of the aircraft have been in service for more than 30 years 
and will be replaced by A320s and the new Sukhoi RRJ aircraft. Dragon Aviation Leasing Company, based in 
New in brief
Beijing, arranged for AerDragon Aviation Partners the delivery of an A320-200 and leased the aircraft immediately 
on delivery to JuneYao Airlines of Shanghai. This is the first aircraft for the new leasing company, a joint venture 
between China Aviation Supplies Import and Export Group Corporation, AerCap and Calyon AirFinance. Eads, 
parent company of Airbus, has sold its 2.12% shareholding in Embraer for Eu124 million ($164 million). The sale 
had been planned because recent changes in the shareholder structure made the shareholding a pure financial 
investment. Eads is to concentrate on core matters and projects that will bring further growth opportunities. 
Giancarlo Cimoli has been replaced as chief executive officer of Alitalia ahead of the shareholders' meeting 
scheduled for February 22. The Italian treasury has named Barardino Libonari as chairman of the shareholders' 
meeting. There has been no announcement of who will be the new chief executive. Korean Air will become a 
shareholder in oil refiner SOil Corp as part of a 2.4 trillion- won ($2.5 billion) deal to secure a stable supply of jet 
fuel. The agreement gives the airline part of a fuel supplier as the price of jet kerosene has soared 60% in the last 
two years. UPS will cancel the order for ten A380 freighters. The order is worth around $2.8 billion at list prices. The 
decision to cancel came after UPS discovered Airbus planned to divert development work on the freighter version of 
the A380 to concentrate on its passenger model. Emirates Airline has signed an agreement with GE Commercial 
Aviation Service (GECAS) to lease an additional five 777-300ERs. The aircraft are due for delivery in the second 
half of 2008. British Airways has told its check-in staff to use discretion over the two bags rule, but has decided not 
to drop excess baggage fees. Passengers can check-in bags that weigh 32kgs in total but from September 30 that 
limit goes down to 23kgs per passenger. The airline is planning to add up to £240 on return longhaul flights if 
passengers check in an extra bag.

Fears of a strike at Aer Lingus faded Wednesday after the airline and Ireland's largest labor union both accepted a 
court investigation into their showdown.
The SIPTU union, which represents about 1,800 Aer Lingus workers, chiefly ground crew, withdrew its threat to 
shut down Aer Lingus operations Sunday over the company's plans to introduce a new contract of employment for 
all 3,300 workers Thursday.
Aer Lingus chiefs agreed to postpone any changes to employees' working hours, overtime and holiday time as part 
of the deal with the Labour Court, which has the power to impose solutions on industrial disputes.
Aer Lingus says it needs to impose new, tougher rules on its employees immediately to become more competitive, 
notably with Dublin-based rival Ryanair, Europe's biggest and most cut-throat budget carrier. Ryanair refuses to 
recognize unions.
But SIPTU, the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, said Aer Lingus had no right to change 
employees' benefits and work conditions without negotiations first.
The union that represents most Aer Lingus pilots and cabin crew, IMPACT, is not involved in the strike threat. But it 
will be involved in the Labour Court hearings, which are expected to run Thursday-Saturday and reach a verdict 
Monday.
Aer Lingus, which the government floated on the Irish and British stock exchanges in September, is under pressure 
to cut costs and remain sufficiently profitable for shareholders.
Ryanair on Oct. 5 launched a hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus, has built a 25.2 percent stake in its rival, and says 
if its takeover succeeds it will slash staff and introduce Ryanair-style operations.
That bid is on hold pending an investigation by European Union competition authorities into whether a merged Aer 
Lingus-Ryanair operation would produce an Irish air monopoly.
Labor union calls off strike threat at Irish airline Aer Lingus
The government, which opposes the Ryanair bid, has a 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus employees and 
retirees who control more than 15 percent of Aer Lingus shares are also resisting the bid.

Body
The Dublin market recovered slightly in late morning trade today, however, by midday the ISEQ was still down 1pc 
on the session.
Having fallen over 3.5pc yesterday the ISEQ index again opened lower this morning, with shares down as further 
2.5pc by 0900.
At midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares had made a modest recovery, but was still 92.12 points lower at 9444.11, 
off session lows of 9,281.94.
 The weak opening came after Wall Street shares suffered their worst falls since the 9/11 attacks in 2001 overnight. 
The sharp dip came amid growing unease in global equity markets over prospects for the US and Chinese 
economies. A slump in China's stock market stoked fears around the world yesterday that the rapidly-growing 
economy may be forced to slow down by government intervention on rates and borrowing. A further catalyst for the 
fall came from the US, with negative comments from former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan. He warned 
the world's biggest economy may fall into recession by the end of the year, saying the US budget deficit remained a 
major hurdle for economic growth. Dermot O'Leary, chief analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers, said that the ISEQ 
will be 'attached to the global rollercoaster' for a while yet and that we yesterday may not be the end of the slump. 
The main fallers in Dublin this morning were AIB, down 58c to 22.22, CRH, down 65c to 31.80, and Kingspan, down 
79c to 20.63. Irish Life and Permanent was down a disappointing 65c to 21.25, despite today announcing a 26pc 
rise in operating profit during 2006. Cider maker C and C was also lower, down 110c to 10.67 after it released a 
trading statement saying that profits for 2006 are expected to be "significantly reduced" due to capital expenditure 
associated with cider capacity expansion and investment in working capital. Despite the turbulence elsewhere, no 
frills airline Ryanair was still flying high, up 10c to 5.78.

Inmarsat, the satellite communications company, yesterday revealed a 6 per cent fall in profits as military use of its 
satellite phones declined in the Middle East.
But it said growth would be boosted next year by new services such as broadband internet access, handheld 
satellite phones and providing in-flight mobile telephony to airline passengers.
The London-based group, which provides satellite phone and internet services to the US army, ship owners, 
broadcasters and aid workers, said pre-tax profits for 2006 were Dollars 89.8m, down from Dollars 95.5m in 2005.
Inmarsat's performance was boosted in 2005 by demand from rescue and aid work in the aftermath of the Asian 
tsunami and Hurricane Katrina. Use of Inmarsat's satellites by the US army in Iraq has also been declining since 
2003, as the military has set up its own more permanent networks in the region.
But Andrew Sukawaty, chief executive, said he expected a boost in 2007 from services to new lightweight 
broadband satellite receivers, and from last year's launch of handheld satellite phone services. Inmarsat is also to 
provide the satellite backbone for airlines such as Ryanair and Emirates, which will begin allowing passengers to 
make mobile phone calls on flights.
Inmarsat shares closed down more than 5 per cent at 389 3/4p.

Aer Lingus and Ireland's largest labor union opened negotiations Tuesday aimed at averting a strike this weekend 
over the airline's plans to cut staff benefits and overtime.
Aer Lingus has warned customers to prepare for potential flight delays Wednesday, the day before a strike vote by 
the SIPTU union comes into effect.
SIPTU says it will strike for a 24-hour period Sunday if Aer Lingus does not withdraw plans to introduce tougher 
rules for working hours, overtime and holiday time. Aer Lingus has already applied the new rules to new recruits.
Negotiators from both sides agreed to hold talks in Ireland's Labour Court, which has the power to impose solutions 
on industrial disputes.
The Aer Lingus chief executive, Dermot Mannion, said the airline must aggressively prune staff costs to become 
more competitive, notably with Dublin-based budget rival Ryanair. He rejected union accusations the new work 
rules were unreasonable or were being imposed too quickly.
"Our agenda of change in work practice issues has been clear for a long period of time. We need to move forward 
with this with extreme urgency," he said outside the court.
SIPTU national secretary Michael Halpenny said members might mount lower-level protests before Sunday, 
including refusal to do overtime or remain on standby.
"The company will have been the ones who pull the trigger on this. If they fire ahead, we will have to protect 
ourselves," Halpenny said.
SIPTU, the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, represents about 1,800 of Aer Lingus' 3,300-
strong workforce, mostly ground crew.
The union that represents most Aer Lingus pilots and cabin crew, IMPACT, is not involved in the strike threat.

Spanish airline Iberia's fourth-quarter losses widened slightly amid continued pressures from higher operating and 
fuel costs, the company said Tuesday.
Spain's largest airline by sales said its fourth-quarter net loss stood at €9.4 million (US$12.37 million), compared to 
a loss of €5.8 million a year earlier.
For the whole of 2006, Iberia reported a net profit of €56.7 million (US$74.62 million), down from a net profit of 
€395.8 million a year earlier. Results for 2005 had been bolstered by the sale of its stake in travel reservations 
company Amadeus Global Travel Distribution.
Iberia said operating costs widened 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter to €1.33 billion (US$1.75 billion), with fuel costs 
widening close to 20 percent to €317.8 million (US$418.22 million).
Iberia has faced intense competition from low-cost airlines easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC after both 
companies increased operations in Spain. It is now focusing on long-haul routes and the introduction of a new 
business service to capture a larger slice of these lucrative market segments.
Iberia said fourth-quarter revenue rose 7.8 percent to €1.37 billion (US$1.8 billion). For the whole of 2006, revenue 
rose more than 10 percent to €5.46 billion (US$7.19 billion).
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rentals, or Ebitdar Iberia's preferred measure 
of profitability were 36 percent higher at €214.7 million (US$282.55 million).
For the full year, Ebitdar rose 13 percent to €790.6 million (US$1.04 billion).
Shares were down 4.5 percent at €3.17 (US$4.17).

No frills airline Ryanair today said that it is to launch 50 new routes in the coming months, which will create 5,000 
new jobs across Europe. 
The airline today welcomed the arrival of ten brand new aircraft that it will receive over the next 2 months. 
These aircraft deliveries, worth USD700 million will bring Europe's lowest fares to even more passengers. The 
aircraft will result in 50 new routes that will create 5,000 new jobs. 
 Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's head of communications, said, "Ryanair's USD700 million investment 
will create 5,000 jobs across Europe as we expand our existing bases at Barcelona Girona, East Midlands, London 
Stansted and launch our second German base in Bremen. "Ryanair is starting 50 new routes all over Europe in the 
coming months, thanks to these aircraft, bringing even lower fares to European consumers. These new routes will 
provide a massive boost to local economies all over Europe with increased visitor numbers and massive savings for 
passengers. "Ryanair's no fuel surcharge guarantee is widening the gap between our low fares and the high prices 
of our fuel surcharging competitors. This is driving demand and attracting millions of additional passengers to

Aer Lingus said it had agreed to attend exploratory talks with SIPTU in the Labour Court today in an attempt to

SIPTU has threatened the action to try to halt the airline's planned introduction on March 1 of new terms and

 The union said the action will be followed by an ongoing overtime ban and work-to-rule and that further stoppages

staff costs to become more competitive, notably with Dublin-based budget rival Ryanair, according to a report in the

Body
The Dublin market ended its record-breaking week with a whimper today, with shares in Irish Life and Permanent 
and CRH leading the fallers.
Having touched on an all time record high above 10,000 earlier in the week the ISEQ index closed 24.35 points 
lower at 9,910.36.
A cautious opening by Wall Street failed to lift sluggish trading in Dublin. Stocks in the U.S. were under pressure, 
with investor sentiment hit by rising oil prices and sharp falls in software giant Microsoft.
 Irish Life and Permanent was the day's biggest faller here, down 50c to 22.30, as it prepares to release its full year 
results for 2006 on Wednesday. Elsewhere in the sector, AIB was down 4c to 23.46, while Bank of Ireland added on 
1c to 18.50 and Anglo Irish Bank jumped 10c to 16.60. In the construction sector, CRH was a notable faller, down 
15c to 33.30, after the building materials group confirmed the appointment of Kieran McGowan as its new chairman. 
He will succeed present chairman Pat Molloy. Elsewhere, Grafton - due to publish its full year results on Thursday - 
was up 6c to 12.69. Dolmen is forecasting operating profit of E240 million and earnings per share of 75c. Such a 
performance would represent year on year increases of 11pc and 13pc. Dolmen analyst, Stuart Draper, said the 
growth has been driven primarily by "continued buoyancy in the group's Irish merchanting chains, Chadwicks and 
Heiton Buckley, combined with some year on year recovery at the group's UK operations". Meanwhile, Kingspan 
and McInerney both closed in the black, up 17c to 21.10 and 8c to 16.75 respectively. Shares in Aer Lingus were up 
again following reports that Ryanair is set to increase its bid in the former state airline and confirmation from the EU 
that it has extended the deadline for its examination of Ryanair's bid from May 11 to June 13. Although its previous 
bid has lapsed, Ryanair remains confident that it will win approval from the EU and has said it will renew its bid if 
clearance is given. Shares in Aer Lingus closed 2c higher at 2.87 last night, while Ryanair fell 5c to 12.35.

The European Commission on Thursday extended until June 13 its deadline to rule on Ryanair Holdings PLC's 
€1.48 billion (US$1.9 billion) hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus PLC.
It refused to say why.
"Ryanair and the Commission have both agreed that it would be useful for the inquiry to have extra time," EU 
spokesman Jonathan Todd told reporters.
Regulators set an initial deadline of May 11 when they launched an in-depth investigation into the deal, saying they 
saw "serious competition concerns" with the proposed combination of Ireland's two major airlines because it could 
reduce customer choice and raise fares.
Europe's largest no-frills airline had withdrawn the takeover offer in December when the EU's executive arm 
launched its investigation, but said Feb. 5 it hoped to renew its bid when the EU probe wraps up.
Ryanair's bid already looked troubled before that when it sought to build on its 25 percent stake. Investors opposed 
to a buyout control more than 46 percent of shares.
The Irish government, which owns a quarter of the country's national carrier, is fiercely opposed and less 1 percent 
of Aer Lingus shareholders had accepted the Ryanair offer.
The Commission can demand companies sell off units or change the way they do business before it grants the 
approval need to close the deal.
It could force the airlines to give up takeoff and landing slots at their Dublin hub. Regulators demanded that Air 
France SA and the Netherlands' KLM give up slots at their home airports of Paris and Amsterdam when they 
merged in 2004. Lufthansa AG and Swiss also had to make similar concessions last year.

Ryanair has denied reports that it is preparing to raise its bid for Aer Lingus by 15pc.
The airline said there was "no truth" in a report in The Business magazine which quoted a source at Ryanair as 
saying that chief executive, Michael O'Leary, is "considering increasing his offer significantly".
The report said that a figure of E3.10 had been mooted, which O'Leary hoped would be enough to get the 50.1pc 
stake needed to take control of the Irish flag carrier.
 In a statement today, Ryanair said: "There is no truth to the article in The Business Magazine this morning. Neither 
Ryanair, nor any of its representatives have made any statements to this magazine". Ryanair bid E2.80 per share 
last year for Aer Lingus, a 27pc premium to the share price at the time of E2.20, valuing the airline at E1.48bn. The 
European Commission launched an inquiry in December into the now-aborted initial offer, citing 'serious 
competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines. Its decision has been postponed 
from May 11 until June 13 because it needs more time to consider the evidence, Ryanair said today. The company 
said in a statement it is confident that the transaction will be cleared by the European Commission as it is a 'pro-
competitive and pro-consumer deal, which will bring lower fares, greater efficiency, new aircraft and more choice for 
consumers around Europe'. It recently said if the ruling goes in its favour, there is a 'very good possibility' it will bid 
again either immediately or in the next year. Ryanair built up a 25.2pc stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid, 
which is opposed by the Irish government, Aer Lingus's employees trust and Irish businessman Denis O'Brien, who 
together hold 40.1pc.

Ryanair today said it was confident that the EU Commission will allow it to take over Aer Lingus on competition 
grounds.
The deadline for making a decision on the transaction was extended today by the European Commission, with the 
agreement of Ryanair, from 11 May 2007 to 13 June 2007.
"Ryanair is confident, as it has been throughout the process, that this transaction will be cleared by the European 
Commission as it is a pro-competitive and pro-consumer deal, which will bring lower fares, greater efficiency, new 
aircraft and more choice for consumers around Europe. It will enable Ryanair to take on the traditional/national 
airlines, who continue to fleece European consumers with high fares and unjustified fuel surcharges," a statement 
from Ryanair said.

The European Commission today said the deadline for its inquiry into low-cost carrier Ryanair's proposed 
acquisition of Aer Lingus is extended to June 13.
The original deadline was May 11. It was extended following agreement between the commission and the 
companies. No reason was given.
In December, The EC opened a Phase 2 inquiry, which will give the Commission 90 days to decide if the take-over 
would significantly impede competition within the European Economic Area.
 Ryanair has said it would make a new offer for Aer Lingus if the commission cleared the deal.

Body
The ISEQ index of Irish shares broke through the 10,000 mark today for the first ever time before falling back late in 
the session.
Shares have soared over the last three weeks on the back of numerous strong trading updates from some of the 
market's biggest firms. 
Indeed, today's gains mean that the ISEQ has now soared approximately 9pc since the end of January.
 The ISEQ ended the day 27.90 points higher at a new record closing high of 9,981.08. The index had climbed as 
high as 10,028.47 earlier in the session. Shares in Dublin are expected to rise even further in the coming weeks 
with the likes of Kerry, McInerney, United Drug, Irish Life and Permanent and Paddy Power all due to release 
results. Investor sentiment in Dublin was boosted by a positive opening on Wall Street thanks to easier oil prices 
and strong results from Wal-Mart. However, the majority of market players were holding steady ahead of several 
key events tomorrow. These include a rate decision in Japan, the release of Bank of England and Federal Reserve 
meeting minutes and U.S. CPI inflation data. The star performer today in Dublin was CRH, up 90c to 34.05. The 
building materials group received a boost after Vulcan Materials, the biggest producer of highway construction 
materials in the US, announced the purchase of Florida Rock Industries for USD4.6 billion. Goodbody said the deal 
"validates CRH's strategic approach to America". CRH is due to unveil its full year results on March 6. Elsewhere in 
the construction sector, McInerney, which his due to release its results for 2006 on Monday, was up 20c to 16.70, 
while Grafton jumped 2c to 12.78. Shares in Kingspan closed 14c higher at 20.85 as it prepares to publish its full 
year results at the beginning of March. Amongst the financials, Anglo Irish was the only bank to close in the black, 
up 3c to 16.48, with Irish Life and Permanent down 10c to 22.60 and Bank of Ireland down 4c to 18.45. AIB ended 
the day unchanged at 23.95. Ryanair closed 9c higher at 12.45 after the airline's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, 
said that he is likely to retire in the next two or three years. He said airline will need "more conservative leadership"

The recent Ryanair mishaps on some landing approaches for landing (Flight International, 6-12 February) reveal 
unprofessional behaviour rather than decisions taken because of pilots' fatigue.A professional airline pilot increases 
the safety margins when hit by fatigue rather than taking short cuts to shorten the flight time, especially in the final-
approach procedures.Ryanair's approach incidents reveal a gung-ho mentality encouraged by operators through 
their flight managers or chief pilots to shorten flight times. I suggest that the chief pilots be demoted together with 
the guilty pilots.I think Michael Walton's judgement (Flight International, 13-19 February) on Ryanair's four events 
due to unpredictable coincidences is not correct.My military and commercial experience has led me to be wary of 
too many coincidences in flight operations and have convinced me that "pushy" airline policies are bound to create 
more than a few "coincidences".I wonder if the UK Civil Aviation Authority's commissioned report took in 
consideration the pilots' contracts and salaries to analyse them as to see if there are, or were, special incentives or 
"rewards" for going beyond their commercial duty (operating safely, economically - on time - and as comfortably as 
possible for passengers).Low-cost carriers economically survive by operating strictly on time. 
This puts pressure on pilots when the weather is bad. Orlando GiacichWeston super Mare, Somerset, UK

It was not the most auspicious start to launch an airline in the same week as the September 11 terrorist attacks on 
the US but SkyEurope, central Europe's first low-cost carrier, has firmly established itself as the region's largest. 
Founded with Dollars 2m seed fund capital and initially operating a single domestic route, the Slovak-based airline 
operates 79 routes in 19 countries and carried almost 3m passengers in 2006.
But while passenger numbers grew 48 per cent in the past year, it has been a bumpy ride financially and the airline 
has yet to make a profit, reporting a loss of Euros 57.3m for the past fiscal year, double that of the previous year.
At SkyEurope's modest two-storey headquarters on the motorway close to Bratislava airport, Christian Mandl, its 
32-year-old Belgian co-founder and chief executive, insists the airline is on track to climb out of the red.
"In the first few years, it was logical to focus on growth to achieve critical mass but now it's time to slow down 
slightly and deliver profitability to shareholders," says Mr Mandl.
That profitability will come from boosting the load factor, which at 76 per cent last year lags larger competitors, 
easyJet and Ryanair, while new aircraft with better fuel efficiency will cut costs. "Every new route requires at least 
one year to become profitable. If more than half of your routes are new it is difficult for existing ones to 
compensate," says Mr Mandl.
Unlike other carriers, SkyEurope avoids secondary airports.
"The central Europe market is not mature enough to focus purely on the leisure or business sector. Corporate 
customers would not accept remote airports and focusing on leisure passengers would expose us to seasonality 
effects," says Mr Mandl.
In a region where credit card use and internet penetration has yet to reach western levels, SkyEurope has adapted 
its payment methods accordingly. Passengers can book flights at travel agencies and pay for them in banks.
Domestic carrier looks to the east SkyEurope, central Europe's first low-cost airline, has firmly established itself 
as the region's largest
Faced with mostly small individual markets, the airline established bases in Bratislava, Budapest, Krakow, Warsaw 
and Prague, adding Vienna next month.
SkyEurope launched a flotation in Vienna and Warsaw in September 2005, followed a year later by a second public 
offering after which the US-based private equity firm York Capital became the largest shareholder. A rights issue 
prompted 91 per cent of existing shareholders to subscribe, which reflects confidence in the company, says Mr 
Mandl.
This year the share price has doubled on media speculation of a takeover, with Niki Lauda, the former Formula 1 
racing driver, and Ronny Pecik, an Austrian businessman, who has reportedly acquired a minority stake - and even 
Air Berlin - linked to such a move.
Analyst Jan Prochazka of Cyrrus says investors are eagerly awaiting the latest quarter results, which will be the 
airline's "last chance" to prove reasons for optimism and that losses are not deepening.
Nevertheless, SkyEurope's strongest competition is from buses and trains. Central Europeans fly an average 0.3 
times a year, seven times less than their western counterparts. That however offers strong growth potential, 
particularly with higher-than-EU-average GDP, argues Mr Mandl.
Although a central European airline, Bratislava was a good base after Czechoslovakia's 1993 split stripped Slovakia 
of a national carrier. It now accounts for 50 per cent of air traffic at Bratislava airport.
The government's decision to cancel the airport's privatisation set back plans to increase its capacity, benefiting 
SkyEurope by preventing other low-cost carriers from expanding, suggests one analyst.
SkyEurope's domestic flights have linked eastern Slovakia with Bratislava and region-wide mobilised leisure 
passengers and workers while boosting foreign direct investment and tourism, says Mr Mandl.
Meanwhile, SkyEurope has its sights set further east, to Russia, Ukraine and Turkey.
"Russia has strong economic ties with central Europe and once it joins the World Trade Organisation there will be 
opportunities to develop the low-cost model. Why compete with established players in the UK when there are large 
virgin markets crying out for low-cost services?" says Mr Mandl.

Being involved in aviation on a day-to-day basis, although not connected to Ryanair, I am surprised by the fact that 
incidents (not accidents ) are not reported with the same accuracy for all operators. Judging by press reports, 
Ryanair seems to have a terrible record of incidents. From inside the profession, I can tell you that more serious 
incidents take place in other companies - or should I say in others countries? The UK/Irish authorities seem more 
willing to communicate, which is the proper attitude. But the lack of communication and investigation by other 
authorities covers other's mistakes or faults and therefore presents certain operators as being safe compared with 
others. It presents a false picture and deceives consumers. J P GhosezBrussels, Belgium

Sharp gains in Elan failed to inspire a sluggish Dublin market today as the ISEQ turned lower on profit taking after

Just after 1300, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 9.01 points to 9,924.24.
Pharmaceutical group Elan was up 25c to 11.10 after it's American Tysabri partner yesterday released initial uptake 
figures for the Multiple Sclerosis drug. Biogen Idec said that nearly 10,000 patients have been prescribed Tysabri 
since its reintroduction last June. Despite lingering safety concerns and strict health monitoring required for 
patients, the company remains bullish on the drug's potential. CEO James Mullen said Biogen Idec and Elan 
"continue to believe Tysabri will eclipse all of the other MS therapies over time."
 However, those gains were outweighed by a sluggish performance by construction shares. CRH slipped 16c to

The Dublin market's recent strong run shows no sign of coming to an end, with shares soaring to a new record 
closing high today.
The ISEQ index jumped 1pc on the back of sharp gains in pharmaceutical company Elan and clinical research 
group ICON. Financial and construction shares also moved notably higher.
Investor sentiment here was also buoyed by a strong finish to the session in London and a positive opening on Wall 
Street.
 The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 98.36 points higher at 9,933.25 - an all time record trading and closing high. 
ICON was the day's biggest gainer, up 100c to 33.00 after it posted strong fourth quarter and full year figures earlier 
in the week. The group said that net income rose 65pc to USD11.4 million, or 39c, a share in the fourth quarter of 
last year, up from USD7 million, or 24c, as share a year ago. The company said the rise was the result of a strong 
backlog of orders and a 22pc rise in new business. Meanwhile, full year revenue was USD455.6 million, a 33pc 
increase on the previous year. Shares in Elan were given a boost by a trading update from its U.S. Partner Biogen 
Idec, which showed a twofold rise in earnings per share for the fourth quarter of last year. For Elan shareholders, 
the main points of interest in the release were the much awaited number of patients on Tysabri in the U.S. and in 
Europe. Biogen Idec executives said today that nearly 10,000 patients have been prescribed Tysabri since its 
reintroduction last June. Despite lingering safety concerns and strict health monitoring required for patients, the 
company remains bullish on the drug's potential. CEO James Mullen said Biogen Idec and Elan "continue to believe 
Tysabri will eclipse all of the other MS therapies over time." He added that the company expects Tysabri to become 
available in 15 European Union countries by the end of this year. The drug is now primarily available in the U.S., 
Germany and Sweden. Financial shares were also higher, with Bank of Ireland up 17c to 18.37, Anglo Irish Bank up 
22c to 16.55 and Irish Life and Permanent up 15c to 22.35. AIB closed 23c higher at 22.63. Elsewhere, CRH was 
again in the black, up 25c to 33.45, amid continued takeover speculation in the sector. Other construction shares

CRH led the Dublin market to a fresh record closing high today after it received an upgrade from Davy 
Stockbrokers.
Shares in the building materials firm soared 114c to end the day at 33.15. The sharp rise came after Davy lifted its 
forecasts for CRH. The broker said that it is one of the poorest performing stocks in the building materials sector 
year-to-date and currently offers "excellent earnings growth prospects".
"We believe there is plenty of scope for earnings upgrades, probably starting with the group's full-year results 
announcement on March 6th. Earnings are also likely to benefit from continuing acquisition spend."
 Other construction shares were also higher, with Grafton up 13c to 12.88, Kingspan up 15c to 20.65 and 
McInerney up 25c to 15.80. The strong performance of the sector helped lift the ISEQ index of Irish shares 124.29 
points higher to an all-time record high of 9,834.89. The index was also lifted by modest gains in the financial 
sector, with Bank of Ireland up 23c to 18.08, AIB up 28c to 23.40 and Anglo Irish Bank up 28c to 16.33. Irish Life 
and Permanent was up 17c to 22.05. Shares in clinical research group ICON fell back late in the day on profit taking 
after it announced an impressive set of results for the fourth quarter of 2006. Shares had been trading around 5pc 
higher for much of the day, however, investors began to pocket gains towards the end of the session. The group 
announced on Tuesday that net income rose 65pc to USD11.4 million, or 39c, a share in the fourth quarter, up from 
USD7 million, or 24c, as share a year ago. The company said the rise was the result of a strong backlog of orders 
and a 22pc rise in new business. Meanwhile, full year revenue was USD455.6 million, a 33pc increase on the 
previous year. Ryanair slipped into the red on profit taking as it began its first day on the Nasdaq 100 index. Shares 
in the airline jumped more than 3pc on Tuesday after it announced the listing. The airline hopes the move will raise 
its investor profile. "The index is made up of the 100 biggest non-financial firms listed on the exchange, and 
Ryanair's inclusion means that investment managers running funds that track the index will buy the stock in order to 
maintain a balanced portfolio," Dolmen Stockbrokers said. Shares were down 14c to 12.45 in Dublin today. 
CRH leads ISEQ to all-time record close
Elsewhere, business support services group DCC was up 33c to 27.30 after it was confirmed that housebuilding 
firm Manor Park, in which DCC owns a 49pc stake, is up for sale. Reports suggest that the company could be sold 
for as much as E750 million. Other notable movers included Paddy Power, up 31c to 18.45, Kerry Group, up 15c to

highs, while over on Wall Street, stocks rallied early on after the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke

hopes the move will raise its investor profile. "The index is made up of the 100 biggest non-financial firms listed on 
the exchange, and Ryanair's inclusion means that investment managers running funds that track the index will buy 
the stock in order to maintain a balanced portfolio," Dolmen Stockbrokers said. Shares were down 9c to 12.50 in 
Dublin today. Elsewhere, other notable movers included business support services group DCC, up 33c to 27.30, 
amid press speculation that housebuilding firm Manor Park is set to be sold off. DCC owns a 49pc share in the firm. 
Reports suggest that the company could be sold for as much as E750 million. Paddy Power was up 33c to 18.40, 
while Irish Continental Group fell 3c to 16.01 and CPL Resources added on 11c to 7.85.

Denis O'Brien, the Irish telecommunications entrepreneur, is to raise a Dollars 1.4bn bond to buy out the minority 
shareholders in his 78 per cent-owned Digicel telecoms company, in a deal that values the Caribbean-based mobile 
operator at Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.2bn).
According to New York bankers involved in the deal, the Irishman will receive Dollars 1.87bn for his stake, 
reinvesting between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.1bn in a new company, which he will own outright.
The new company, which like Digicel will be registered in Bermuda, will have total debts of Dollars 2.7bn.
Digicel is being advised by Citigroup, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse,and Lehman Brothers. Mr O'Brien is being 
personally advised by Rothschild, the UK bank.
The main minority shareholders are Denis O'Brien senior, the entrepreneur's father; Leslie Buckley, Digicel vice-
chairman; Seamus Lynch, former chief executive; and Lucy Gaffney and PJ Mara, two fellow directors.
There have been reports that Mr O'Brien was preparing to conduct an initial public offering of Digicel on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Those plans have now been dropped.
Bankers say Mr O'Brien has for the moment also dropped all plans to buy a mobile virtual operator in the US.
Mr O'Brien started his business career as personal assistant to Tony Ryan, founder of GPA, the aircraft leasing 
company and the no-frills airline Ryanair. He made Euros 240m (Pounds 161m) when he sold Esat Telecom, 
Ireland's second mobile operator, to BT in 2000.
Using Jamaica as a beach-head, Digicel was set up in 2000 taking on the incumbent Cable and Wireless.
It is now the leading operator, with 4.1m customers across the region, including in El Salvador where it launched 
last year.

Pelle Tornberg, who helped create the freesheet phenomenon by building Metro International from a small Swedish 
group to the publisher of the world's largest newspaper title, is leaving his post as chief executive of the company 
just as it reports its first profit.
"I said that when we had truly established the company I should resign. It's a matter of self-discipline," he told the 
Financial Times yesterday. "We had reached a critical mass where we could truly start to capitalise on our pan-
European platform."
Mr Tornberg, who also led the listing of Modern Times Group, will remain a non-executive director of other 
companies in the portfolio of Kinnevik, the Swedish family-controlled investment group.
A search for his successor began yesterday, with Mr Tornberg saying the group would be "open minded" about 
internal and external candidates but cautioning that the group may have to look beyond the newspaper industry for 
talent.
Few newspaper executives had experience outside their home markets, he said. "We see ourselves as the Ryanair 
of the newspaper industry. If that's the case, we shouldn't be recruiting from Aeroflot," he added.
News of Mr Tornberg's resignation came as the group announced 16 per cent growth in full-year sales, a reduction 
in its debt and its first profit since it was founded in 1995. Its shares rose 7.5 per cent to SKr10.75.
Net profits of Dollars 13m, up from a loss of Dollars 7m in 2005, were largely due to aDollars 12.3m profit booked 
when it sold its operations in Finland, but Mr Tornberg argued they represented a "landmark".
Metro International's search for profit, after stumbles in markets such as Poland, where it was forced to close its 
title, has slowed its rate of new launches.
Tornberg quits Metro as it goes into the black MEDIA
Mr Tornberg said international expansion remained more of a priority than paying dividends. Although Germany 
was still "a white spot on the map of Europe" for the group, opportunities in North America, Asia, Russia and online 
were morepressing.
"Germany should be done when the timing is right. We could do that today but there are many other interesting 
opportunities to expand in the US. We could launch in another couple of cities in Canada; Asia has been very 
healthy; andRussia, where we're in St Petersburg, is also of interest," he said.
Mr Tornberg suggested he was now looking for new entrepreneurial challenges. "I've launched two listed 
companies in my life - Modern Times Group and Metro International.
"To launch Metro in 21 countries is not something you do only on Monday and Tuesday."

Michael O'Leary said he would step down as Ryanair chief executive in the next couple of years, by which time the 
company would have become "an establishment airline".
In an interview with Irish radio, he said: "I think I will have gone from Ryanair in the next couple of years. I think it 
will be another two or three years. Partly because when we become the largest airline it will have to change."
He added: "It can't be my sort of (company) - some people call it Robin Hood, some people call it jumped- up 
Paddy, running around shouting at governments and others.
"We'll need to change the way the business is run when we become the big establishment airline and that will need 
different management skills to the ones I possess."
Mr O'Leary's maverick management style has been closely identified with the success of Ryanair, which was 
founded in 1985 by Christy Ryan to fly from his Waterford base to London.
It was after Mr O'Leary took over as chief executive in 1994 that the airline began its rapid expansion.
This is the first time Mr O'Leary has publicly indicated he intends stepping down in two years. However, brokers 
noted that over the past couple of years he has been reducing his personal shareholding in the company, which this 
week joined the Nasdaq 100 with a market value of more than Pounds 7bn.
Mr O'Leary put himself at the centre of a political row in Ireland last year when Ryanair launched an unsuccessful 
hostile bid for Aer Lingus, the former state-owned airline in which the Irish government retains a 25 per cent stake.
Ryanair also owns about 25 per cent and indicated last week it may make another bid for its rival next year.

One of the reasons the bid was thwarted was the position taken by the employee share ownership trust, which 
owns 12.6 per cent of Aer Lingus.
It sided with existing management in rejecting the offer. The pension funds of two pilot groups, which together own 
4 per cent, also opposed the bid.
Union members at Aer Lingus voted on Monday to take industrial action.

Aer Lingus is planning to open its first base outside Ireland, according to reports.
The plan, which is similar to the expansion strategy of its main rival, Ryanair, is part of a move that will allow the 
airline to establish 15 new European routes between destinations outside Ireland. 
The airline has already shortlisted three airports for its first foreign hub, according to the Irish Independent.
 The report says the airline hopes to introduce new work practices so these plans can go ahead, but strike action by 
staff opposed to the new working conditions is likely before the end of this month. The changes include provisions 
which allow Aer Lingus to employ people at foreign bases, on "local market rates", or to relocate existing 
employees.

Body
The Dublin market recovered from a sluggish start today to close modestly higher as shares in Ryanair soared to an 
all time high after it announced it is to join the Nasdaq.
Sharp gains in Elan and ICON also helped outweigh losses in the financial sector.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 30.87 points higher at 9,710.60.
 Ryanair was notably higher after it announced that it is to be included on the Nasdaq 100 index from the start of 
trading tomorrow. Ryanair will replace American Power Conversion which manufactures power products. Ryanair 
has a market capitalisation of USD5.6 billion, which will be used in the Nasdaq-100 index weighting, the airline said. 
Howard Millar, Ryanair's Chief Financial Officer said the listing will bring "greater visibility and wider appeal to both 
institutional and private investors worldwide". Shares in the airline jumped 31c to 12.59. "Inclusion in the Nasdaq 
100 is likely to provide further technical support for the stock," NCB analyst John Sheehan said in a research note. 
"This should complement an already attractive investment case founded upon continued delivery of it business plan 
i.e. new routes, new bases, growing ancillary revenues and tight cost control." Elan was also higher, up 5c to 10.23, 
after the pharmaceutical group denied reports it is to invest USD100 million in substantial expansion in North 
America. The group was reacting to report in the San Francisco Business Times which recently suggested the 
company was looking to lease an additional 185,000sq ft - covering two new buildings - from its landlord, 
Chamberlain Associates. Shares in the group were up as it prepares to release its fourth year results next Tuesday. 
Davy has predicted that revenues will rise by 7pc year-on-year to USD150.6m, mainly through its Multiple Sclerosis 
drug Tysabri. Meanwhile, ICON was the day's star performer, with shares closing 166c higher at 32.00 after it 
announced a 46pc rise in revenues for the fourth quarter of last year and a 33pc rise in revenues for the full year. 
Those gains outweighed modest falls in financial shares, with Bank of Ireland down 5c to 17.85 and AIB down 4c to 
23.06. Anglo Irish Bank closed 1c higher at 16.05, while Irish Life and Permanent bucked the trend, up 23c to

after it announced the E40 million sale of a site at Sandyford Industrial Estate in Dublin earlier in the week. DCC is 
also said to be considering the sale of its 49pc stake in the homebuilder Manor Park. Joe Moran, the 70-year-old 
businessman who controls the firm, has said that he would be willing to sell the whole company for E700 million. 
Bookmaker Paddy Power was up 12c to 18.14, while bathroom firm Qualceram Shires fell 11c to 2.28 and drinks 
group C and C lost 20c to 11.65.

I refer to your editorial and report about safety at low-cost carrier Ryanair (Flight International, 6-12 February). The 
UK Civil Aviation Authority commissioned a report into human factors and low-cost operations some years ago that 
offered nothing to show any increased risk. The Cork incident reveals remarkable similarities with a similar incident 
that occurred just three months earlier at Bristol and was reported in the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch 
Bulletin 11/2006, although it received little press attention. Furthermore, the four Ryanair events all have very 
different causal factors. Might it be that we see pattern in coincidence? I have no wish to be an apologist for 
Ryanair, but unsafe practices in aviation are not equally visible across the industry. Some airlines manage to bury 
bad news while others are hung out to dry.Norman MacLeodSt Neots, Cambridgeshire, UK

Having closed at record highs no less than four times last week, shares on the Dublin market slipped back today, 
with the financials weighing heavy.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 39.02 points lower at 9,679.73.
AIB was a notable faller in the financial sector, down 22c to 23.03, as investors await earnings releases from some

are all due to publish results this week, while Depfa announced a 45pc increase in fourth quarter profits to E142 
million this morning. The numbers will give an update on the state of play of the European financial market, analysts 
said.
 Elsewhere in the sector, Bank of Ireland was down 5c to 17.90, while Anglo Irish fell 6c to 16.06. Irish Life and 
Permanent was down 25c to 21.65. Meanwhile, CandC's recent modest recovery was checked, with shares in the 
Bulmers owner falling 15c to 11.85. Shares in Independent News and Media were up 3c to 3.33 after it was 
confirmed that the group stood to pocket over E350 million from reducing its stake in Australia's APN from 42pc to 
35pc. The windfall comes after it was announced that a consortium led by Independent had agreed a E2.3bn deal 
to buy the just-under 60pc of APN that the Irish group didn't already own. Elsewhere, Aer Lingus was down 5c to 
2.80 after it announced it is to cut its fuel surcharges on long-haul flights to reflect the recent fall in oil costs. The 
airline said it would cut the fuel charges it levied last year by 25pc. Ryanair slipped 5c to 12.28 on profit taking after 
its sharp gains last week. Shares in the no-frills airline soared after it announced a shock 30pc rise in profits for its 
third quarter to the end of December. In the construction sector, CRH was down 22c to 32.00, while Grafton lost 2c 
to 12.75. McInerney was unchanged at 15.55, with Kingspan down 15c to 20.35. Elan was down 2c to 10.18 amid 
reports on the west coast of the US that it is planning a USD100 million expansion in South San Francisco. It is also 
claimed that Elan will be looking to add an additional 500 staff. Goodbody analyst Ian Hunter said: "If correct, these

actions hint of a company confident in the progress of at least one of its drugs". "Elan does have a range of 
products coming through the pipeline, but we believe they are too early in the development process to warrant such 
up front spend. Expansion of the drug delivery and subsequent contract manufacturing business from the current 
base in Ireland into the US is also a possibility. However, with Tysabri already launched and being produced by 
Biogen Idec, we believe that if this reported expansion is on-going, then it could signal company confidence in 
potential AAB-001 progress." Other notable movers included Paddy Power, up 17c to 18.02, DCC, up 40c to 26.60, 
ICON, up 133c to 30.34, and Tullow Oil, up 5c to 6.20. The falls in Dublin were in line with those on Wall Street, 
with sliding oil prices and lower technology stocks weighing on sentiment. Investors in the U.S. are also awaiting a 
stream of key economic data later this week. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is set to speak before 
Congress on Wednesday, while Government data due on Friday will shed new light on wholesale inflation and the

Tiger Airways, the Singapore-based low-cost airline, plans to enter the domestic Australian market with the 
establishment of a new carrier to compete directly with the local duopoly of Qantas and Virgin Blue.
Tony Davis, chief executive, said the move was a further step in Tiger's strategy to establish a pan-Asian low-cost 
aviation group using a common brand and common business model.
Tiger, which is 49 per cent owned by Singapore Airlines, is moving into a liberal Australian domestic aviation 
regime, which places no restrictions on the foreign ownership of domestic airlines.
Temasek, the Singapore government investment group, owns 11 per cent of Tiger.
Irelandia Investments, the investment vehicle of the Ryan family that founded Ryanair, holds 16 per cent. Indigo 
Partners, a US investment fund part owned by Texas Pacific Group founder David Bonderman, owns 24 per cent.
Tiger has previously announced plans for a commercial partnership with SEAir, a small Philippines operator of 
turboprop aircraft, which will lease two Airbus A320 jets from the Singapore carrier for the development of a low-
cost airline business using the Tiger brand.
It is following the path pioneered by Malaysia's Air-Asia, the leading low-cost carrier in the Asia-Pacific region, 
which also expanded by setting up partner airlines in Thailand and Indonesia using a common brand.
The low-cost airline market in Australia is divided between Virgin Blue and by Jetstar, a subsidiary of Qantas, which 
started flying domestically in May 2004 and has its headquarters in Melbourne.

No-frills airline, Ryanair said it intends to sue the Aviation regulator for a second time for 'unlawfully imposing full 
slot co-ordination at Dublin Airport'.
A Ryanair statement said that there is no runway congestion at Dublin Airport and no need for slot co-ordination.
'The introduction of slot co-ordination will limit competition and drive up prices. Dublin Airport is a two-runway 
airport, which caters for just 20 million passengers a year and there is ample room for growth. With just one runway, 
London Gatwick presently caters for twice as many,' Jim Callaghan, Head of Regulatory Affairs at Ryanair said.
 'The Commission's decision to slot co-ordinate Dublin Airport makes even less sense this time than the last time 
around. There is more check-in capacity this year with 25 additional check-in desks and 14 more stands coming on 
stream in winter 2007 with Pier D. Runway capacity is also clearly not being fully utilised as Dublin already has two 
runways and yet handles only half the 40 million traffic of the one runway Gatwick airport,' he said.

Singapore's low-cost carrier Tiger Airways has launched a major expansion bid in Australia, with plans to fly 
domestic services on Outback routes that could kick off a price war with the country's existing airlines.
Tiger has lodged applications with the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority for 
the necessary regulatory approvals, and Chief Executive Officer Tony Davis held talks on Friday with Transport 
Minister Mark Vaile to brief him on the plans.
Davis said Tiger services could begin by the end of 2007 if regulatory approval is given.
"We are looking to expand to be a nationwide business," Davis told Dow Jones Newswires. "We hope to be 
operating a fleet of five Airbus A-320s by the end of this year on domestic operations."
Australia currently has just two major domestic operators national carrier Qantas Airways, which operates full-fare 
services and a low-cost offshoot, Jetstar; and Virgin Blue, the Australian branch of British mogul Richard Branson's 
budget airline and competition is fierce.
Tiger, which is 49 percent owned by national carrier Singapore Airlines and 11 percent owned by state-owned 
investment company Temasek Holdings, has run services between the island state and northern Australian city of 
Darwin since 2005.
The company, which also has as big shareholders U.S. aviation investment company Indigo Partners LLC and a 
company connected to the European airline Ryanair, will start services from Singapore to the southwestern 
Australian city of Perth in March.
Elsewhere in Asia, Tiger this year added destinations in Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia to its roster, which 
includes four destinations in China and Macau, and five holiday destinations in Thailand.
Singapore's Tiger Airways hopes to fly Australian domestic routes by end-2007
In Australia, Tiger will focus on destinations that bigger airlines had dismissed as unsustainable, Davis said. The 
route network would be finalized in coming weeks.
"We will be looking at some smaller airports, some regional airports ... to see if we can't help develop some of the 
smaller and secondary airports as alternatives to the existing infrastructure," Davis said.
Tiger would aggressively pursue its low-cost strategy, and was unconcerned its competitors could respond by 
slashing their fares to try to force Tiger out.
"I think you're going to see single digit fares plus the taxes across Australia once Tiger starts operating," Davis said. 
"We're committed to bringing in a completely different level of pricing to Australia."
"It will be up to the competition as to how they will respond," he said.
Vaile said Tiger would have to create an Australian company before it could start operating and must meet stringent 
safety requirements.
"I welcome the promise of increased competition a new entrant would provide to the domestic market particularly 
for consumers, the tourism industry and the economy," Vaile said in a statement.

The Dublin market soared more than 100 points today to close at a record high for the fourth time in the last five 
sessions.
CRH led the way after it completed the purchase of a cement plant in China, while a strong opening on Wall Street 
also gave investor sentiment a boost.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 106.92 points higher at 9,718.75.
 Building materials group CRH was the star performer in the construction sector, up an impressive 75c to 32.14, 
while Kingspan jumped 40c to 20.60 and McInerney added on 10c to 15.60. Elsewhere, Housebuilder Abbey was a 
notable riser, up 34c to 11.99. Grafton closed 32c higher at 12.80 after Goodbody Stockbrokers increased its full-
year share price target for the building materials group to E14, up from its previous E13 target. The brokers said the 
upgrade was the result of the group's strong track record and the possibility of acquisition-led expansion. The 
company is also expecting to see earnings per share (EPS) growth of 12pc at Grafton this year and 10pc in 2008. 
Goodbody's EPS forecasts for Grafton for 2007 are unchanged at 85.4c, but its forecast for 2008 has been 
increased by 4pc to 93.7c. In the financial sector, AIB made the biggest jump, up 35c to 16.16, while Bank of 
Ireland made steady progress, tacking on 25c to close at 17.92. Anglo Irish Bank moved a modest 8c higher to 
16.16, with Irish Life and Permanent ending the day unchanged on 21.55. Shares in Independent News and Media 
paused for breath, down 1c to 3.29, having soared by more than 5pc in the last week. The rise in came after 
businessman Denis O'Brien increased his stake in the firm from 3pc to 5pc. Mr O'Brien is reported to have spent 
around E50 million on the stake, meaning that he now holds a total of 38.6 million shares. Ryanair again made a 
notable jump, up 21c to 12.40, after it announced a shock 30pc jump in profits for the three months to the end of 
December 2006. Meanwhile, shares in Aer Lingus slumped 5c to 2.85 after the former state airline announced a 
3.7pc fall in its load factor during January (the number of seats filled per flight). However, the airline said it had 
ISEQ up 106pts to all-time record high
carried 591,000 extra passengers in the month compared to the same month in 2006. It said this was the result of 
more people taking short-haul flights, offsetting a decline in long-haul passengers. Short-haul routes accounted for 
518,000 of the passengers, with the remaining 73,000 thousand travelling to long-haul destinations such as New 
York, Boston and Dubai. However, the load factor came in at 69.9pc with long-haul down 2.4 percentage points at 
73pc and the load factor on short haul flights down 4.2 percentage points at 67.4pc. Other notable movers included 
bathroom furnishings firm Qualceram Shires, up 9c to 2.39, C and C, up 10c to 12.00, and Irish Continental Group, 
up 19c to 15.80. Elan fell 13c to 10.22, with Donegal Creameries down 5c to 6.55 and IAWS up 5c to 18.60.

Shoppers' online rights need to be updated to take advantage of the internet market, the European Commission 
said yesterday.
Meglena Kuneva, the consumer protection commissioner, said only 6 per cent of online purchases were cross-
border transactions. "Can you imagine how many lost opportunities there are for businesses, especially for small 
and medium-sized businesses?"
She proposed a number of solutions in a green paper that kicks off six months of consultations yesterday.
Ms Kuneva wants the EU's 27 member states to open up the worldwide web by harmonising basic conditions such 
as rights to refunds and cooling-off periods during which buyers could return goods. She said common standards 
could be done by agreement rather than a new directive to replace the eight that are up to 20 years old.
There are plenty of other barriers, such as payment problems and language. Yet a Commission survey showed that 
worries about a lack of protection ranked higher than language.
A spokeswoman for Ms Kuneva said only a handful of companies such as Ryanair, the low-cost airline, had 
successfully built a pan-European booking network on line.
"Without one set of standards across the bloc, innovative businesses will not expand across borders and attract 
customers."
Not all businesses are in favour of common standards. The BDI, the German industry federation, is worried about 
an idea in the green paper to reverse the burden of proof for faulty goods in the customer's favour. Producers could 
also face greater liabilities.
Call for online shopper rights
Jim Murray, director-general of the Bureau of European consumers, said the move should lead to improved 
consumer rights. But he added: "We hope, too, that the review will draw attention to the extent to which the acquis 
(law) is enforced (or not) by the member states at national level."

BAA responded defiantly yesterday to an Office of Fair Trading proposal to refer it to the Competition Commission 
for investigation and rejected calls from airlines for a break-up of its monopoly at London's three main airports.
Stephen Nelson, chief executive, said the airports group, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial, had "no intention" of 
selling any of its seven UK airports.
Mr Nelson rejected the OFT's invitation to undertake to address the competition concerns raised in the initial market 
study by the office, which BAA said was a "weak basis" for a reference for a full-scale investigation.
BAA's airports handled 145m passengers in the year to March last year, accounting for 63 per cent of the UK total. 
It owns Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, serving London; Glasgow, Edinbugh and Aberdeen in Scotland; and 
Southampton.
It accounted for 92 per cent of all passengers using London airports in 2005, and for 86 per cent of passenger 
volumes in Scotland.
John Fingleton, OFT chief executive, said in December the office believed that greater competition could bring 
significant benefits for passengers.
There was "evidence of poor quality and high charges - BAA's investment plans, which are of great importance to 
the UK, have raised significant concerns among its customers. These are signs of a marketnot working well for -
consumers".
Mr Nelson said he was "concerned at the OFT's narrow focus on the structure of BAA". The real problem for 
passengers was a "lack of capacity, not the structure of BAA", he said. "This shortfall is the result of a complex 
interplay of political, planning and environmental issues, all of which need examination.
"There is a great opportunity over the coming years to deliver dramatic improvements for passengers . . . but this 
requires a regulatory system that encourages investment. I do not believe the current regulatory model in the south-
east fits this purpose."
Airports operator rejects market inquiry
BAA said it accepted that the airport market deserved study but believed the OFT had adopted an "uncritical 
approach" to many of the issues raised in its initial study. It had not set out a "compelling case that BAA's airports 
can compete more significantly, and serve the consumer interest better, under separate ownership".
BAA said it believed strongly that separate -ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would not address the 
core problems facing airports in thesouth-east.
The consultation period over the OFT's initial report ended yesterday and it is expected to call on the Competition 
Commission to begin a detailed investigation into BAA within weeks.
BMI British Midland, Heathrow's second biggest airline, yesterday followed several other carriers including British 
Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair in calling for an end to BAA's monopoly ownership of Britain's three busiest airports.

Ryanair has been criticised by the Irish Aviation Authority for continuing to land at a British airport despite heavy 
fog.
Reports this morning say 15 Ryanair jets landed at Stansted on the night of April 24th last year despite the fact that 
most other aircraft diverted elsewhere.
Visibility was within safety regulations for 11 of the landings, but reports this morning say the IAA has found that 
four of the landings breached these regulations.
 The authority has reportedly described the case as a "critical safety issue".

Body
Irish shares closed modestly higher this evening at a new record closing high after the ECB signalled that a rate 
hike in March is likely despite today's no change announcement.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 22.18 points higher at 9,611.83, having been as high as 9,649.49 earlier in 
the session.
The ECB, as widely expected, left rates unchanged at today's council meeting, keeping its main refinancing rate at 
3.50pc.
 However, in the his post-meeting press conference, ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said the ECB must 
exercise strong vigilance on inflation risks in the euro zone. Trichet's reintroduction of the term 'strong vigilance' into 
his statement was widely seen as confirmation that the ECB is preparing to raise rates again at its next monetary 
policy meeting on March 8. Trichet indicated last month that he was comfortable with market expectations for a 
March rate hike. In his statement, Trichet also said that 'acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability 
in the medium term remains warranted'. He said ECB monetary policy continues to be accommodative and that 
interest rates are still at 'low levels'. The news had a mixed effect on financial shares in Dublin, with AIB and Irish 
Life and Permanent both falling, down 10c to 22.90 and 15c to 21.45 respectively. Shares in Bank of Ireland 
climbed 11c to 17.61 after it earlier this week announced a 26pc rise in sales at its life and pensions subsidiary. The 
company attributed the sales of E441 million to strong growth in its lump-sum investment business. Elsewhere, 
Anglo Irish Bank was unchanged at 16.08. Construction shares were also mixed, with CRH and Grafton both down, 
17c to 31.38 and 6c to 12.60 respectively. Kingspan ended the day 14c lower at 12.20, with McInerney up a 
marginal 5c to 15.48. One of the days star performers was Ryanair, up 13c to 12.18, as shares in the airline 
continue to be buoyed by the 30pc rise in profits for the third quarter announced earlier this week. Meanwhile, 
business support services group DCC tacked on an impressive 109c to 25.94. Shares in IAWS fell 20c to 18.50 
after it moved to distance itself from reports that it is looking to up its stake in Swiss bakery company Hiestand. 
ISEQ up 22 points despite ECB hike hints
IAWS currently owns a 33pc stake in the firm. Elsewhere, ICON ended the day 99c lower at 29.01, as it prepares to 
release its results for the fourth quarter of 2006 next Thursday. Goodbody Stockbrokers is forecasting a 48.1pc 
increase in adjusted earnings per share over the same period in 2005 to USD0.36. "This will be driven by a 38.5pc 
increase in net revenue over the same period last year to USD122 million, coupled with a 60 book value per share 
improvement in operating margins," Goodbody's Ian Hunter said. Bookmaker Paddy Power closed 5c lower at 
17.75, while FBD Holdings jumped 30c to 40.90, Aer Lingus tacked on 2c to 2.90 and Donegal Creameries added

EasyJet expects pre-tax profits to rise by between 40 and 50 per cent for the full year following a steady 
improvement in its first-quarter revenue figures, writes Toby Shelley.
The low-cost airline yesterday predicted passenger revenues per seat would continue to improve in the second 
quarter after a 4 per cent increase in the first quarter.
Ancillary revenues from sales of insurance, car hire and other services were also picking up momentum.
Ancillary revenues increased 22 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter with further acceleration expected. By 
contrast, passenger revenue per seat was up 2.3 per cent.
In the first quarter, passenger numbers were up 9.8 percent at 8.1m, largely due to increased capacity in 
Switzerland and Italy. The load factor declined by 0.5 per cent to 81.7 per cent.
Earlier in the week, rival Ryanair said that passenger numbers had increased 19 per cent in the third quarter, while 
passenger revenues rose 28 per cent helped by a 7 per cent increase in average fares.
Despite the profits forecast from EasyJet, its share price fell 15p to 675p yesterday.
Analysts at Collins Stewart said in a note that EasyJet's valuation now looked stretched in comparison with Ryanair.
Oriel Securities, however, suggested that pressure on yields at the airline could be less than expected.

The Dublin market closed marginally lower today, following four consecutive days of gains.
Shares had traded slightly higher for much of the day, however, the ISEQ turned negative late on ahead of the 
European Central Bank's rate verdict and ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet's press conference tomorrow.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the day 10.07 points lower at 9,589.65.
 While the majority of analysts are predicting that the ECB will leave rates unchanged at 3.50pc, the market moved 
to protect itself from a potential rude awakening in President Trichet's post meeting speech. Many economists are 
forecasting a quarter point hike in March and another probably in June, taking the benchmark rate up to 4.00pc. 
Another record breaking session on Wall Street failed to lift investor sentiment in Dublin, with U.S. stocks higher in 
early deals following forecast-busting results from network equipment maker Cisco Systems and reassuring 
economic data. A stronger-than-expected productivity reading and weaker-than-forecast labour costs gave 
investors fresh signs the economy is holding up and keeping inflation largely in check. Back in Dublin, financial 
shares weighed heavy on the market, with AIB down 11c to 22.95, Anglo Irish Bank down 8c to 16.07 and Irish Life 
and Permanent down 1c to 21.49. Bank of Ireland fell 2c to 17.60 despite its insurance arm, Bank of Ireland Life, 
announcing a 26pc rise in new business sales to E441.3m. Ryanair's good week continued after it announced a 
shock 30pc rise in third quarter profits, a 33pc jump in passenger traffic for January and the opening of its 19th 
European base in Dusseldorf. The airline continued to grab the headlines today after its chief executive, Michael 
O'Leary, sent a memo to pilots threatening dismissal for mistakes. Shares in the no-frills airline closed 6c higher at 
12.04. Meanwhile, Aer Lingus lost 4c to 2.88 on profit taking after it announced a "strategic alliance" with American 
budget airline JetBlue on Tuesday. Shares in clinical research services company ICON fell 40c to 30.00 as it 
prepares to release its fourth quarter results next week. Davy Stockbrokers is forecasting a 39pc rise in revenue 
growth to USD122.7 million and a 62pc jump in earnings per share to 39c. Davy analyst, Jack Gorman, said strong 
organic growth in the clinical division, coupled with the labs' transition to profitability was the main driver of growth.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, is intensifying the competitive battle in the German aviation market by 
opening a third German base at Dusseldorf Weeze.
The airport is located about 70 km north-west of Dusseldorf near the Dutch border. It was a Royal Air Force base 
until 1999 and began civilian operations in 2003.
The expansion in Germany is taking the Irish operator into increasing competition with Lufthansa and its low- cost 
subsidiary Germanwings, Air Berlin and EasyJet. Germanwings has its main base at Cologne-Bonn airport with 
further bases in Stuttgart, Berlin and Hamburg and is seeking to develop a broad presence in its home market to 
counter the expansion by foreign carriers. These are led by Ryanair and EasyJet, the UK no-frills operator, which 
already has bases in Berlin and Dortmund.
Ryanair's Dusseldorf Weeze base, its 19th in Europe, will be launched in June and will follow shortly after the 
opening of a second German base at Bremen in northern Germany in April.
The Irish low-cost carrier is moving rapidly to establish a network of operating bases in the big European markets 
with to date five in the UK, three in Italy, three in Germany, two in Spain, and three in Ireland. It also has single 
bases in France, Belgium and Sweden, the broadest geographic spread of any European airline.
Ryanair has its most important operating base in continental Europe at Frankfurt-Hahn, a former US fighter base 
located 90 km west of Frankfurt. It is aiming to increase the number of aircraft based at Hahn, from six to 18 by 
2012.
The airline said that it would initially locate two aircraft at Weeze with a network of 10 routes adding Alghero 
(Sardinia), Alicante, Palma and Venice to the six existing routes to London Stansted, Glasgow Prestwick, Rome 
Ciampino, Stockholm Skavsta, Shannon and Barcelona-Gerona.

Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has sent a memo to pilots threatening dismissal for mistakes.
The memo said pilots will be demoted the first time they make a dangerous approach, and sacked for a second 
offence.
The warning follows several potentially serious incidents involving a Ryanair aircraft approaching an airport too fast 
or at the wrong height and being forced to abort landing.
 All Ryanair staff are under pressure to meet turnaround times of only 25 minutes, the tightest in the industry, and 
pilot unions say this can lead to mistakes. The memo said that a new disciplinary procedure is being introduced in 
response to a series of "high energy approach incidents over the past two years", according to a report in The 
Times today. "From 25th September 2006, any event involving any of our aircraft passing the 500ft landing-gate 
incorrectly configured or at excessive speed ... - and which does not perform a go-around - will automatically lead to 
both crew members being demoted in the case of their first transgression of this policy," the memo said.

The Dublin market closed at a fresh record high today for the second day running, on the back of modest gains in 
AIB and Ryanair.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended the day 31.93 points higher at 9,599.72, having climbed as high as 9,603.23 
earlier in the session.
Gains were capped somewhat by a sluggish start across the Atlantic. Stocks on Wall Street drifted into the red as 
crude oil prices firmed on a cold weather snap and amid caution ahead of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech 
last night.
 AIB was one of the days biggest movers, tacking on 27c to close at 23.12. Ireland's biggest is due to publish its 
results for the full year at the beginning of next month. The current consensus forecast is for 2006 earnings per 
share growth of 22pc to E1.78, well ahead of previous forecasts. Ryanair closed in the black for the second 
consecutive day, up 4c to 12.02, after it announced a shock 30pc rise in third quarter profits and a 33pc rise in 
passengers for January on Monday. The results confounded analyst expectations for a fall. Europe's biggest low-
cost carrier said profit after tax rose to E47.7 million in the three months to end December from E36.8 million in the 
same period of 2005. Forecasts had been for a fall of more than 60pc. Meanwhile, Ryanair is reported to be 
considering distributing around E300 million to shareholders in the form of a share buyback program or special 
dividend. The airline has already announced a two for one share split, which will come into effect on February 26. 
Elsewhere, shares in Aer Lingus added on 7c to 2.92 after it announced plans to form a "strategic alliance" with 
American budget airline JetBlue. The deal marks the world's first tie-up between two international low-cost carriers 
and will allow customers to make just one booking meaning they can travel from Ireland to the US with Aer Lingus 
and then onto a direct Jet Blue flight to destinations in the US, Mexico and the Carribean. In the construction sector, 
CRH ended a rather sluggish day down 1c to 31.59, while Grafton added on 5c to 12.45. McInerney slipped 1c to 
15.35, with Kingspan falling a disappointing 30c to 20.25. Shares in Anglo Irish Bank also took a tumble, down 12c 
ISEQ jumps 31 points on Ryanair & AIB
to 16.18, while Irish Life and Permanent fell 12c to 21.35. Bank of Ireland ended the session 11c higher at 17.68. 
Other notable movers included drinks group C&C, up 9c to 11.89, pharmaceutical group Elan, down 19c to 9.93, 
fruit firm Fyffes, up 3c to 1.14, and Independent News & Media, up 1c to 3.09. Shares in the Irish Continental Group 
were down 5c to 15.75 on profit taking, after the one of the group's subsidiaries opened a new container terminal at 
the Port of Belfast. The new container has increased container handling capacity at the Port by 40pc. Elsewhere, 
Qualceram Shires fell 12c to 2.36, while Paddy Power added on 1c to 17.76.

Ryanair has become the subject of a second "serious incident" report in the last two months by the Irish Air 
Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU). The investigations are probing approaches at two Irish airports that were 
mishandled by the aircraft's flightcrews.The AAIU describes the most recent incident, which took place during a 4 
June 2006 approach to Cork airport, as a "human factors event", and criticises the captain for poor crew resource 
management (CRM) while observing that the far less experienced co-pilot - who was the pilot not flying - "did 
endeavour to comply with CRM principles as trained", but "his inputs had little effect". Ryanair says that the captain 
of the Boeing 737-800 involved has been demoted for failure to follow company standard operating procedures 
(SOP). Having briefed the first officer for an instrument landing system approach to runway 17 at Cork in weather 
conditions the AAIU describes as "excellent, with only one other item of visual flight rules traffic in the Cork circuit", 
the captain then instructed him to request a visual approach, which Cork approved. Late on the approach, the 
captain recognised he was too high to make a safe landing and asked the co-pilot - who had suggested a go-
around - to request a right-hand orbit to lose height. Cork air traffic control cleared the orbit, but during the 
manoeuvre the captain allowed the aircraft to drop to 553ft (168m) altitude - only 51ft above the airfield elevation - 
as the aircraft was passing above the Bishopstown area of Cork city (see diagram). The lowest radio altimeter 
reading during the turn was 425ft above ground level, reveals the report, and early in the orbit the 30?
 maximum bank angle for normal operations was exceeded by nearly 2?. According to the flight data recorder, 
when the aircraft intercepted the runway extended centreline for its final approach it was following a 1-1.5? 
glideslope instead of the ILS's 3?. The co-pilot reported that all four visual precision approach path indicator lights 
were showing red, and the captain initiated a climb to put the aircraft on to a safer approach path. The aircraft's low 
height over the town provoked 16 formal protests by residents, the report says.The AAIU observes that since 
Ryanair is already acting on recommendations in the recently published report on a mishandled approach at Knock 
last March (Flight International, 12-18 December 2006), similarities between the two occurrences mean the AAIU's 
latest report does not contain any additional requirements.

Seven months after full details of alleged breaches of safety regulations by Irish-registered aircraft operating into 
London Stansted airport were passed to the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), the agency says it has not yet completed 
its investigation nor taken any action.The UK Civil Aviation Authority, which confirms it passed the details of the 
alleged events to the IAA, says it would normally have expected an outcome by now.The issue under investigation 
is regulatory: a number of landings on 24 April 2006 at Stansted airport were allegedly carried out when it was too 
foggy for pilots to have complied with their company minimum descent height and runway visual range (RVR) 
criteria.At the time Stansted's weather minima were higher that normal because the airport operator BAA was 
carrying out maintenance on the runway lighting, so reduced lighting was available despite the poor visibility. The 
CAA says this information was made available to airlines and crews via the notices to airmen (NOTAMS) system 
and by Stansted air traffic control.Investigators have to decide whether - if minima were breached - it happened 
because pilots ignored the revised minima or were simply unaware of them. Aircraft from some other airlines 
diverted to alternate airports. 
The landing aircraft involved were Ryanair Boeing 737-800s, the IAA confirms. The carrier's chief pilot Capt Ray 
Conway says that if there were any breaches of RVR minima it was unintentional on the part of the pilots. 
Stansted's first NOTAM on the subject did not emphasise that the runway lighting downgrade affected the RVR 
minima, according to Conway.Because the IAA is responsible for the regulation and safety oversight of Irish-
registered aircraft - even if they are operating overseas - the CAA says that after it had ascertained that the airport 
had complied with all the safety regulations pertinent to the situation, it handed details of the aircraft operations to 
the IAA for further action. The IAA says it has almost finished its investigation, but has not yet sent the draft to 
Ryanair for its response. Conway comments that he doubts this will become a public document because it is not an 
accident or incident report.

Ryanair has had another "serious" approach incident. So what? It happens to other carriers.But questions need to 
be asked. Why does an airline with such a high-quality training organisation, and a pilot selection system that does 
not allow dummies into its flightdeck, end up with a string of approach incidents like these?The Rome Fiumicino go-
around was the most worrying, but it is easier to understand how the situation developed because the pilots began 
their first approach in a very high workload situation, dodging thunderstorms and coping with a runway change. The 
Skavsta and Knock approaches were rushed by the pilots, but since the circumstances were not particularly 
demanding, their actions are more difficult to comprehend. The most recent incident - at Cork - was an unforced 
piece of undisciplined flying by the captain. Carrying out an orbit to lose height on approach on a brilliant day is a 
valid manoeuvre. Forgetting about altitude and height above ground level is just slack.Ryanair chief pilot Ray 
Conway ensures his crews see flight-data monitoring video replays of incidents like the one at Knock. The airline's 
standard operating procedures are sound.So why? We said it before: the Irish Aviation Authority needs to 
commission a report on the human factors of low-cost operations to find out if there is a connection.See AIR

Navigation DAVID LEARMOUNT / LONDONEleven airlines are taking part in trials of equipment that will enable air 
traffic control surveillance in non-radar airspace.Imminent in-service trials of automatic dependent surveillance - 
broadcast (ADS-B) equipment in a fleet of more than 200 commercial airliners is expected to earn European 
Aviation Safety Agency certification for the on-board installations by the end of the year, according to Eurocontrol, 
which is co-ordinating the operation. It will also enable air navigation service providers (ANSP) in both radar-
covered and non-radar areas to test their ADS-B ground stations and prepare procedures for using ADS-B for 
aircraft surveillance, says Eurocontrol.The participating airlines have modified their aircraft to take part in the trials 
which, when the equipment is certificated, will enable them to receive radar-like ATC service in areas - like the 
Mediterranean and some provincial airport terminal areas - where radar is not provided. Where radar cover exists, 
ADS-B provides an accurate back-up surveillance system with a much faster update rate than radar, Eurocontrol 
points out. 
It expects "ADS-B out" - the ground systems - to be operational in continental European airspace next year.The 
airlines equipped with "ADS-B in" - the on-board systems - that are taking part in the trials and certification include 
Aegean Airways, Air Europa, Airbus Transport International, British Airways, CCM Airlines, Cyprus Airways, 
Hapagfly, Lufthansa, Niki, Ryanair and Scandinavian Airlines. Eurocontrol's manager of its Cascade programme, 
which includes the ADS-B trials as well as the implementation of other forms of datalinking services, says: "The 
response to our call [to the airlines] for interest exceeded our expectations. It shows that airlines are willing to invest 
if the objectives and the benefits are clear." ADS-B will also provide pilots with traffic situational awareness displays 
with greater clarity and accuracy than airborne collision avoidance systems can give (Flight International, 23-29 
January).Meanwhile, Eurocontrol's programme to deal with the increasingly serious shortage of secondary 
surveillance radar (SSR) transponder "squawk" codes is also being prepared for implementation in 2008. Known as 
the centralised SSR code assignment and management system (CCAMS), the idea is to make more efficient use of 
the available 4,096 codes by abandoning the inefficient system of allocating batches of specific codes to nations. 
Instead, individual codes would be allocated via a central server at Eurocontrol's Central Flow Management Unit to 
each flight as its flight plan is activated.

Ryanair goes from strength to strength. A few days after British Airways announced that operating profits fell 27 per 
cent year on year in its third quarter from October to December, the Irish low-cost carrier unveiled a 16 per cent 
increase in profitability over the same period.
Ryanair's strength continues to be its combination of cost control and pricing flexibility. Since it breaks even at lower 
loads, Ryanair can price up to its rivals when they raise prices and price down when necessary to gain market 
share. This meant it was able to raise average fares by 7 per cent over the quarter. The flow-through from 
increased revenues to profits was somewhat hampered by higher fuel costs - Ryanair's hedging policies have not 
been the most prescient - but operating margins were still an impressive 14 per cent.
It remains difficult to tell whether Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, was serious. The bid has lapsed 
but can be re-tabled later in the year. Meanwhile, Ryanair is sitting on a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus as well as 
Euros 300m of net cash. Shareholders must hope the Aer Lingus battle does not distract Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair's chief executive, from an earlier commitment to hand them back some money in the form of a special 
dividend or share buyback.
While waiting, investors can take comfort from Ryanair's continued momentum. The low-cost airlines are still 
increasing market share in Europe, a trend that should continue well into the next decade. The valuation of 
Ryanair's shares, at about 25 times the company's guidance for 2007 earnings, certainly seems to assume growth 
at current rates for the foreseeable future, if not forever. Even if a premium to its peers is justified by Ryanair's 
growth outlook as well as its superior business model, such heights are not for the faint-hearted.

Rising airfares helped Ryanair, Europe's leading low cost airline, increase profits sharply in its third quarter and 
raise its profit forecasts for the full year.
The results were achieved despite a big jump in its fuel bill, and were well ahead both of Ryanair's own previous 
guidance and market expectations.
The Ryanair share price closed 76c or 6.8 per cent higher at Euros 11.98, the highest since the carrier was floated 
in 1997.
The share price has risen by 55 per cent in the last12 months.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, told financial analysts that the airline was considering a Euros 300m 
(Dollars 388m) to Euros 400m special dividend or share buy-back with a decision likely in early June when it 
disclosed its annual results.
Net profit for the full year to the end of March was forecast yesterday to rise by around 29 per cent to Euros 390m.
Mr O'Leary said average fares had risen by 7 per cent in the third quarter, in sharp contrast to the warning the 
airline gave last summer that average fares were likely to fall by 5-10 per cent in its winter months from October to 
March.
Based on bookings received so far, yields, or average fares, in the current final quarter would also be unchanged 
from last year.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair's performance had been helped by the fuel surcharges still being levied by many 
competing airlines.
The surcharges have allowed the Irish carrier to raise its own fares while maintaining a price gap with the 
competition and still filling more than 80 per cent of its seats despite the addition of new aircraft and the opening of 
new routes and bases.
Higher fares help Ryanair profits soar TRAVEL & LEISURE
In contrast to its popular advertising messages and regular free seat sales, the airline's average fares have been 
rising for three years.
Ryanair, the world's most profitable airline measured by net profit margin, will also tap a new source of earnings in 
the next two years from aircraft sales, as it takes advantage of the deeply discounted prices it pays Boeing for new 
aircraft and of the very strong market for selling second hand aircraft.
Ryanair profits have also been helped this year by the introduction of charges for checked-in baggage.
The airline also continues to be successful in increasing ancillary earnings - such as commission income from hotel 
bookings, car rental and travel insurance via its website.
The group increased its pre-tax profits in the third quarter by 26 per cent from Euros 40.6m to Euros 51.2m and 
inthe first nine months by36.5 per cent from Euros 310.1m to Euros 423.4m.
Net profit in the quarter rose by 30 per cent from Euros 36.8m to Euros 47.7m, while turnover increased by 33per 
cent from Euros 370.7m to Euros 492.8m.

European energy providers were the main focus yesterday but equity markets remained flat as profit-taking in the 
banking sector offset gains for oil groups.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended the session 0.04 per cent higher at 1,538.32.
Endesa, the Spanish power generator, fell 2.4 per cent to Euros 38.10 after German rival Eon submitted its final bid 
at Euros 38.75 a share, a discount to Friday's closing price of Euros 39.04 but up from its previous Euros 34.50-a-
share offer.
"Eon's bid is high enough to be perceived as a winning bid," said Lueder Schumacher at Dresdner Kleinwort. 
"Although some Endesa shareholders might have been hoping for more, it should still get approval from the Endesa 
board."
Endesa's board discusses the Euros 41bn deal today.
The withdrawal of Gas Natural's offer last week removed many perceived obstacles to Eon's success but 
stakebuilding in Endesa by Acciona, the Spanish builder, could provide some opposition to the deal.
Acciona holds 21 per cent of Endesa. The group said last week it would sell if Eon won majority acceptance. Eon's 
shares slipped 0.4 per cent to Euros 108.97, while Acciona gained 0.3 per cent to Euros 155.45.
The Eurofirst 300's biggest faller was Norway's Renewable Energy, (REC) after Good Energies Investments, its 
biggest shareholder, sold12.5 per cent of the solar power group to Orkla, the Norwegian conglomerate, at a large 
discount to Friday's closing price. The sale was part of a three-way deal that involved Orkla signing a long-term 
silicon supply contract with Q-Cells, the German solar panel maker, and a sale by Good Energies of a further 17.9 
per cent of REC to Q-Cells. After the transaction, Good Energies will hold 49.55 per cent of the German group and 
4 per cent of REC.
"The announcement is negative for REC," said Adrien Bommelaer at Credit Suisse. "This downplays hopes of a bid 
from Orkla for the remaining REC shares."
Endesa falls following Eon bid EUROPE
REC fell 11.3 per cent to NKr141, while Orkla added 3.6 per cent to NKr402.
Credit Suisse said the deal was positive for Q-Cells, as it was securing a big stake in its main supplier of silicon. Q-
Cells reported that full-year operating profit more than doubled, beating expectations, after an 80 per cent rise in 
sales. Shares gained 18.5 per cent to Euros 49.40.
Ryanair, the Irish airline, climbed 6.8 per cent to Euros 11.98 after announcing a surprise 30 per cent rise in third-
quarter net profit. The group raised its full-year profit targets, forecasting savings in fuel costs after hedging.
Credit Suisse, the investment bank led the financial sector lower after ING encouraged investors to take profit 
following the stock's 16 per cent rise in three months. SEB, the Swedish Bank, fell 1.9 per cent to SKr230.50 after

Ryanair Holdings PLC announced 16 new routes Tuesday and declared the airport it uses near Duesseldorf, 
northwest Germany, to be its 19th base.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the no-frills airline would launch four new routes from Duesseldorf in 
June, linking northwest Germany with Alghero, Sardinia; Alicante and Palma, Spain; and Venice, Italy.
"We look forward to offering the 35 million German and Dutch consumers who live within two hours of our new 
Duesseldorf Weeze base unbeatable low fares for less than half the price of Lufthansa or Air Berlin," O'Leary said.
Ryanair already operates six routes from Duesseldorf Weeze, including to London and Rome.
The airline said it was opening a dozen other new routes from March to June that would bring four new destinations 
into the Ryanair network: Palma Alicante in Spain, Maastricht in the Netherlands, and Zadar, Croatia.
Ryanair also announced it was shutting down two underperforming routes: London Stansted-Deauville, France, and 
Girona, Spain-Marrakech, Morocco.

No-frills airline Ryanair, today announced its 19th European base in Dusseldorf Weeze. 
From June 2007, the carrier said that it will invest E140 million in two new aircraft and 10 routes. 
Ryanair said that it will deliver 1 million passengers in its first full year, rising to 2 million p.a. from 2008. 
 These 2 million passengers will create 2,000 local jobs and enable passengers to fly for a fraction of the high fares 
charged at Dusseldorf International airport. Michael O'Leary, CEO said, "Ryanair's 19th base will revolutionise 
travel in the Dusseldorf area by offering passengers real low fares to 10 exciting European destinations. Attempts 
by Dusseldorf International airport and its high fare airlines to prevent competition from Ryanair at Dusseldorf

In addition to the Cork incident, Ryanair has been - or in one case, is - the subject of three other investigations into 
unstabilised approaches since July 2005. It is also one of the airlines involved in an unfinished probe to discover 
whether landings were made at London Stansted airport, UK in weather conditions that were below minimum. In 
addition to the just-released Cork approach incident report, the Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) has 
recently reported on a serious approach incident at Knock on 23 March last year, plus another at Skavsta airport, 
Stockholm on 21 July 2005. The Italian accident investigation agency ANSV is also in the process of investigating a 
near-disastrous unstabilised approach at Rome Fiumicino in stormy weather on 7 September 2005.

Lean operation?"Seven FAT employees have enrolled at UND and in the following weeks will begin a concentrated 
flight training programme designed specifically to meet the needs of FAT." (From a University of North Dakota 
Aerospace Foundation press releasewhy does Far Eastern Air Transport have such an unfortunate acronym?
 Would it be too much of a FEAT to change it?) In denial?Shy and retiring Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has 
positively and absolutely revoked his claim to this year's Total Aviation Person award:"I'm not a cloud bunny. I'm not 
an aerosexual. I don't like aeroplanes. I never wanted to be a pilot like those other platoons of goons who populate 
the air industry." Methinks the gentleman doth protest too muchOne good turnFamed American aviator Bob Hoover 
celebrated his 85th birthday at the Living Legends of Aviation awards in Los Angeles where he became recipient of 
the 2006 Legends Freedom of Flight trophy. The ever-spritely Hoover, who during the Second World War escaped 
from captivity in Germany in a stolen Focke-Wulf FW.190, is best known for his spectacular flying displays in the 
Aero Commander and long association with the Reno Air Races. This night, however, he recounted the value of his 
special friendship with Chuck Yeager, first man to fly faster than sound. "Chuck and I were trying to trying to find out 
how much we could handle physiologically. We'd go through this pressure chamber at Wright Field to test a new 
pressure suit at different altitudes. I was at 65,000ft and all of a sudden I had a failure that caught me between 
breaths without oxygen and I couldn't do anything but wave my arms. Chuck was by the porthole and saw me, and 
got me back on line with pressure - but it was as close as you could go without being wiped out."Gesturing to 
Yeager, who was sitting beside him on the stage, Hoover said later while flying chase on Yeager's X-1, "Chuck had 
a decompression failure and lost heat and pressure. Above 40,000ft ice built up inside the cabin and the windshield, 
and the visibility out of the X-1 wasn't very good anyway. I knew he'd be iced up within seconds and in a serious 
situation. I was chase and he had to follow my contrail to the lake bed - once he was out of fuel it was easy for me 
to catch up. It worked and he got back, and I talked him down - 100ft - 50ft -25ft -7ft - hold it! He made a beautiful 
landing and when he sat it down I said "now we're even!"

Emissions scheme under scrutiny New critical load factor benchmark would favour operators with high seat 
densities legacy carriers may be badly hitEurope's adoption of a critical load factor benchmark in its move to include 
aviation in its existing emissions trading scheme is coming under increasing scrutiny, as legacy carriers look set to 
lose out under existing plans.The European Commission moved late last year to impose extra charges on foreign 
and domestic carriers flying between European airports from 2011, and a year later on all flights arriving at or 
departing from European Union airports.The EC envisages that allocation of tradeable carbon credits will be based 
on a mix of auctioning and free allocation using the benchmark of passenger and cargo kilometres in tonne-
kilometres - termed revenue tonne-kilometres or RTKs. An individual airline will be granted its allowance based on 
traffic recorded two years before the trading period, scheduled to start in 2011.Speaking last week at the 
Sustainable Aviation 2007 conference in Brussels, Jasper Faber, a senior researcher at CE Delft, the Dutch 
consultancy that conducted the impact assessment of inclusion in the EC's emissions trading scheme, admitted that 
"the benchmark is coming under a lot of scrutiny".Switching the allocation benchmark from RTKs to available seat 
kilometres (ASK), for example, could take the pressure off struggling traditional carriers, as the RTK measure 
undoubtedly favours low-cost carriers, running efficient higher seat density fleets at higher load factors.Europe's 
member states are commissioning their own studies on how different airline business models would be 
affected.Increasing the one-year wait on applying Europe's emission trading regime on all airlines by another year, 
restricting the provisions exclusively to departing airlines and even increasing the maximum take-off weight of 
eligible aircraft could be further areas of revision, suggest experts. While Faber says these issues are coming under 
scrutiny from the aviation sector and from governments, he says airlines would be wise to prepare a strategic 
response through lowering emissions by making technical adjustments to the fleet and taking additional operational 
measures.He admits that some airlines will lose out. 
Citing Ireland, where national carrier Aer Lingus and low-cost pioneer Ryanair dominate, he says: "Where there is 
one major inefficient airline and one major efficient airline there will be movement, but at the end of the day it would 
be best to leave it to the market to decide."Professor Peter Morrell at Cranfield Univeristy's Air Transport 
Department agrees that the use of RTKs will favour those airlines with higher load factors and operating aircraft with 
higher seat densities. However, he says while the emission regime will provide financial incentives for airlines to 
No Headline In Original
apply new technologies, the degree to which airlines can invest to reduce emissions is limited, forcing them to buy 
permits. "The emissions trading scheme does not provide a clear long-term price signal while airlines have to plan 
fleet changes based on longer-term assumptions," he says.

Ryanair Holdings PLC reported a 30 percent increase in third-quarter earnings Monday and raised its profit forecast 
for the full year because of better-than-expected sales and lower fuel prices.
Europe's largest no-frills airline also said it hoped to renew its bid in May to take over its Dublin-based rival Aer 
Lingus, presuming European Union competition authorities give their conditional approval by then. Shares in 
Ryanair and Aer Lingus both surged on the news.
Ryanair withdrew its hostile bid in December when EU authorities expanded their investigation into whether a 
merged operation would produce an Irish monopoly.
For the three months ended Dec. 31, Ryanair's net profit rose 30 percent to €47.7 million (US$61.8 million) and 
sales rose 33 percent to €492.8 million (US$638.4 million).
The number of passengers rose 19 percent to 10.3 million, reflecting Ryanair's expansion that meant 21 percent 
more seats were on sale compared to the same period in 2005. Profits per passenger rose 12 percent, partly 
because of the March 2006 introduction of extra fees for checked baggage.
Ryanair said it expects fourth-quarter net profit to be flat, an improvement on its earlier forecast of a 5 percent 
decline. The airline also said it expects full-year profit to rise 29 percent to €390 million (US$505 million), up from its 
previous forecast of 16 percent.
Shares in Ryanair rose 6.1 percent to €11.90 (US$15.42) on the Irish Stock Exchange. Aer Lingus shares rose 5.4 
percent to €2.95 (US$3.82) their highest mark since Ryanair's bid, launched Oct. 5 at €2.80 (US$3.63) a share, was 
withdrawn Dec. 20.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary noted that the carrier's strong performance was happening as other 
airlines were struggling to cope with high fuel costs.
He said fuel costs represented 40 percent of the airline's operating cost, but were under control thanks to a string of 
advance supply contracts that locked in prices.
Ryanair reports strong 3rd-quarter earnings, raises full-year forecast
"We took advantage of the recent oil price weakness to extend our hedging position for fiscal 2008," O'Leary said, 
noting that these fuel-delivery contracts involved half of Ryanair's needs for the April-September period and 90 
percent for the October-March 2008 period.
Ryanair, which began in 1985 with a single route linking southeast Ireland and London, has grown into a cut-throat 
colossus operating 440 routes in 24 countries, often utilizing out-of-the-way airports to minimize costs.
O'Leary said Ryanair plans to open a new hub in Bremen, northwest Germany, in April, and will announce details of 
another hub in continental Europe this month.
O'Leary said Ryanair planned to retain its 25.2 percent stake in Aer Lingus even if the EU shoots down its takeover 
hopes, or if it fails to secure majority support from Aer Lingus shareholders.
Ryanair spent €342.2 million (US$442.9 million) acquiring its Aer Lingus stake after the Irish government in 
September sold off most of its holding in the previously state-controlled airline.
A loose alliance of Aer Lingus shareholders including the government, Aer Lingus pilots and an employee trust 
oppose Ryanair's takeover bid and hold more than 45 percent, complicating O'Leary's attempt to take a controlling 
stake. He has pledged to slash the Aer Lingus payroll and introduce other cost cuts if he prevails.
Despite its spending on Aer Lingus, Ryanair said its cash reserves have grown by 2.4 percent to nearly €2.02 billion 
(US$2.62 billion).

Ryanair Holdings PLC reported a 30 percent increase in third-quarter earnings Monday and raised its full-year

The number of passengers rose 19 percent to 10.3 million, reflecting Ryanair's expansion that produced 21 percent 
more seats for sale compared to the same period in 2005. Profits per passenger rose 12 percent, partly because of

Ryanair said it expects fourth-quarter net profit to be flat, an improvement on its earlier forecast of a 5 percent 
decline. The airline also said it expects full-year profit to rise 29 percent to 390 million euros ($505 million), up from

Shares in Ryanair reached a record of 12.15 euros ($15.75) on the Irish Stock Exchange before falling back to 
close at 11.98 euros ($15.52), still up 6.8 percent.
Aer Lingus shares also jumped to a three-month high amid renewed optimism of an eventual new Ryanair bid, but 
settled just 5 cents (6.5 U.S. cents) higher at 2.85 euros ($3.69) still above Ryanair's withdrawn offer of 2.80 euros

He said fuel costs represented 40 percent of the airline's operating cost, but were predictable thanks to a string of 
advance supply contracts that locked in prices, although not in the current prevailing $55-$60 range.
Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said Ryanair had secured fuel-delivery contracts for about half of its needs for 
the April-September period at $61 a barrel, and 90 percent for the October-March 2008 period at approximately $65 
a barrel. Most of Ryanair's current supply was bought in advance for $73 a barrel, which seemed cheap at the time.

The number of passengers rose 19 percent to 10.3 million, reflecting Ryanair's expansion that produced 21 percent 
more seats for sale compared to the same period in 2005. Profits per passenger rose 12 percent, partly because of 
the March 2006 introduction of charges ranging from €4 to €10 (US$5.25 to US$13) for each piece of checked-in 
baggage.
Ryanair said it expects fourth-quarter net profit to be flat, an improvement on its earlier forecast of a 5 percent 
decline. The airline also said it expects full-year profit to rise 29 percent to €390 million (US$505 million), up from its 
previous forecast of 16 percent.
Shares in Ryanair reached a record of €12.15 (US$15.75) on the Irish Stock Exchange before falling back to close 
at €11.98 (US$15.52), still up 6.8 percent.
Aer Lingus shares also jumped to a three-month high amid renewed optimism of an eventual new Ryanair bid, but 
settled just 5 cents (6.5 U.S. cents) higher at €2.85 (US$3.69) still above Ryanair's withdrawn offer of €2.80 
(US$3.63) a share.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary noted that the carrier's strong performance was happening as other 
airlines were struggling to cope with high fuel costs.
Ryanair shares hit new high after strong 3rd-quarter profit, optimistic 2007 forecast
He said fuel costs represented 40 percent of the airline's operating cost, but were predictable thanks to a string of 
advance supply contracts that locked in prices, although not in the current prevailing US$55-US$60 range.
Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said Ryanair had secured fuel-delivery contracts for about half of its needs for 
the April-September period at US$61 a barrel, and 90 percent for the October-March 2008 period at approximately 
US$65 a barrel. Most of Ryanair's current supply was bought in advance for US$73, which seemed cheap at the 
time.
Ryanair, which began in 1985 with a single route linking southeast Ireland and London, has grown into a cut-throat 
colossus operating 440 routes in 24 countries, often utilizing out-of-the-way airports to minimize costs.
O'Leary said Ryanair plans to open a new hub in Bremen, northwest Germany, in April, and will announce details of 
another hub in continental Europe this month.
O'Leary said Ryanair planned to retain its 25.2 percent stake in Aer Lingus even if the EU shoots down its takeover 
hopes, or if it fails to secure majority support from Aer Lingus shareholders.
Ryanair spent €342.2 million (US$442.9 million) acquiring its Aer Lingus stake after the Irish government in 
September sold off most of its holding in the previously state-controlled airline.
A loose alliance of Aer Lingus shareholders including the government, Aer Lingus pilots and an employee trust 
oppose Ryanair's takeover bid and hold more than 45 percent, complicating O'Leary's attempt to take a controlling 
stake. He has pledged to slash the Aer Lingus payroll and introduce other cost cuts if he prevails.
Despite its spending on Aer Lingus, Ryanair said its cash reserves have grown by 2.4 percent to nearly €2.02 billion 
(US$2.62 billion).

Shares on the Dublin market soared to a record closing high today, on the back of sharp gains in Ryanair, CRH and 
Paddy Power.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 77.40 points higher at 9,567.79, having been as high as 9,563.16 earlier in 
the session.
Ryanair was the star of the session, up 77c to 11.99, after the no frills airline announced a surprise 30pc rise in third 
quarter profits and a 33pc rise in passengers for January.
 Shares in CRH were also notably in the black, up 36c to 31.65, after three of its peers in the US announced 
quarterly results last week, which pointed to a buoyant outlook for US aggregate pricing in 2007. Dolmen 
Stockbrokers said this could provide the scope for some positive earnings surprises from CRH this year. Elsewhere 
in the construction sector, Kingspan was up 45c to 20.45, while McInerney jumped 6c to 15.36 and Grafton added 
on 5c to 12.35. Bookmaker Paddy Power was another major gainer, climbing 42c to 17.70, as it continues to enjoy 
a run of positive sporting results. Gains in Dublin were capped somewhat by mixed trading on Wall Street as rising 
oil prices dampened a flurry of M&A activity. Shares in Anglo Irish Bank were unchanged at 16.20 despite becoming 
the third organisation in the country to use the new Asset Covered Securities (ACS) vehicle for raising funds with a 
target of E5 billion. Both AIB and Bank of Ireland have used the method of raising capital since new legislation 
allowed its use in Ireland two years ago, raising some E9 billion. Anglo Irish, which raised E540 million last week 
through the issue of new equity, says using ACS funding will save money and provide a better funding structure for 
its future capital demands. Meanwhile, AIB was up 15c to 22.85, as it prepares to publish its results for the full year 
to the end of December on March 6. The current consensus forecast is for 2006 earnings per share growth of 22pc 
to E1.78. Dolmen said the performance was 'driven by particularly strong growth from the group's Capital Market's 
and Polish divisions'. 'Even though the group's year-end trading statement in December only gave an 'in-line' 
ISEQ jumps 77 points on Ryanair & CRH
update, it did so the same time last year, only for the guidance to be beaten three months later when the full year 
results were announced,' Dolmen said in its Weekly Outlook. Irish Life and Permanent fell a disappointing 75c to 
21.35, while Bank of Ireland was down 10c to 17.50. United Drug was up 1c to 4.07 after it last week announced 
the purchase of UK specialist medical equipment distributor Pyramed Limited for E8.5 million. The deal marked 
United Drug's sixth UK acquisition. Dolmen says that the firm's balance sheet 'provides the scope for several further 
deals in 2007'. Elsewhere, the strong trading in Ryanair helped to lift Aer Lingus, up 5c to 2.85, while Kerry Group 
added on 30c to 20.30 and Tullow Oil jumped 4c to 6.19. CandC fell 5c to 11.77.

Highlight: Ryanair led the Dublin market to new record trading highs after it announced a 30pc rise in Q3 profits.
Body
Ryanair led the Dublin market to new record trading highs today after it announced a surprise 30pc rise in third 
quarter profits. 
Early in the session, the ISEQ index of Irish shares hit 9,542.97 before retreating back slightly.
Just before midday, the index was up 49.55 points to 9,539.94.
 The no-frills airline also ramped up its full-year profit goal while predicting big fuel-cost savings for the following 
year. Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said profit after tax rose to E47.7 million in the three months to end 
December from E36.8 million in the same period of 2005, against analyst expectations that they would fall by over 
60pc. The company said it had hedged much of its fuel requirements for its 2007/2008 business year at 10pc less 
than it is currently paying, meaning savings on fuel costs for the coming year of E60 million. Aer Lingus was another 
notable riser, up 7c to 2.87. AIB was a major gainer in the banking sector, up 13c to 22.83, while Bank of Ireland 
jumped 12c to 17.57. Anglo Irish Bank was up 5c to 16.25. However, Irish Life and Permanent bucked the trend, 
falling a sharp 80c to 21.30. Elsewhere, Irish Continental Group was up 12c to 15.95, C and C fell 17c to 11.65, 
CRH added on 31c to 31.60 and Kingspan tacked on 30c to 20.25.
