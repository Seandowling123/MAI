LONDON (Thomson Financial) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it carried 17 pct more passengers in 
May than in the same month last year, although its aircraft were not as full.
The Dublin-based carrier said 4,145,574 people travelled with it during the month, up from 3,556,113 in May last 
year.
However, the load factor - a measure of how full its aircraft were - declined by two percentage points to 80 pct as 
the airline expanded its fleet.
Ryanair last week announced an order for 27 more Boeing Co 737-800 jets worth 1.9 bln usd, taking its total firm 
orders for 737-800 jets to 308 and total fleet size, including planned disposals, to 262 by 2012.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Shares in easyJet PLC and Ryanair PLC have been upgraded by ABN Amro on 
valuation grounds, as part of a review of the low cost airline sector, dealers said.
ABN Amro upgraded easyJet to 'buy' from 'hold' with a target price of 640 pence, noting that shares in the firm have 
fallen by 20 pct over the past month.
The revenue outlook is weaker than it previously thought and data is expected to remain soggy over the coming 
months but the broker sees greater upside than downside risk to company guidance on full year profits.
Meanwhile, ABN Amro raised Ryanair to 'hold' from 'sell' with a target price of 5.50 eur from 5.00 eur, noting that 
the shares have fallen 12 pct over the past month.
Ryanair has less opportunity to cut costs than easyJet, said ABN Amro, with greater exposure to rising Stansted 
charges, although the prospect of cash returns to shareholders continues to underpin the share price.
ABN Amro downgraded Air Berlin from 'buy' to 'hold', with a target price of 18 eur from 25 eur, as it said it sees 
greater downside than upside risk to its full year guidance.
The broker added, however, that it continues to see Air Berlin as a viable business model and an opportunity to 
benefit from consolidation within Germany.

OUTLOOK Ryanair set for FY profit rise despite yield softness
OUTLOOK Ryanair set for FY profit rise despite yield softness

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is expected to see its full year net profit 
increase by some 20 pct to around 395 mln eur when it unveils its annual results on Tuesday.
The Irish carrier, which last week said it was buying 27 more Boeing 737-800 jets worth 1.9 bln usd, is also 
expected to 'slightly improve on its guidance for FY07,' according to UBS analyst, Tim Marshall.
However, the key to earnings next year is likely to be the firm's comments on the current revenue environment. 
Ryanair has been reducing prices on seats in the busier summer months and is talking about softness in yield, 
which will be the key point of interest for investors.
In a bid to combat this, Ryanair last month said it would open its 20th European base at Bristol International Airport 
in southwest England. The carrier said it would launch 13 new routes from the airport by the year-end including 
Bratislava in Slovakia, Budapest, Derry and Knock in Ireland, Dinard in France, Katowice, Poznan, Rzeszow and 
Wroclaw in Poland, Milan, Porto in Portugal, Riga in Latvia and Salzburg in Austria.
The no-frills carrier is also expected to update the market on its plans to take over Irish carrier Aer Lingus Group 
PLC.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary last month said he would appeal if the EU opposes its bid for Aer Lingus 
when it concludes its inquiry in July.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings said it is closing three routes and cutting back six 
others to make way for eight new services.
Ryanair said it will close three routes in November, from Shannon to Bournemouth, Lodz in Poland, and Rome.
It also said services between Shannon and Biarritz, Carcassonne, Milan, Murcia, Nantes and Venice will switch to a 
summer-only basis, between April and October ,to accommodate the eight new routes from the airport in west 
Ireland.
The new destinations from Shannon include Birmingham, Dublin, Fuerteventura, Kaunas in Lithuania, Leeds, Luton, 
Riga in Latvia and Tenerife.
From November, Ryanair will also increase the frequency of its Edinburgh service to daily and Manchester to six 
times a week.
Ryanair said the expansion includes its first domestic route from Shannon, to Dublin, and brings the number of 
destinations offered from the airport to 31.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline expects its expanded operation at Shannon to attract 1.7 
million passengers annually.
'This will deliver a visitor spend of 250 mln eur and support 1,700 jobs in the West,' he said. 'In the space of just two 
years, Ryanair has delivered dramatic tourism and economic growth for Shannon and the West as promised.'

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - British Airways, Ryanair and Air France-KLM have all had their price targets cut by 
Citigroup and earnings forecasts lowered, in separate notes on the carriers, dealers said.
In a note to clients, Citigroup repeated its 'buy' stance on British Airways but trimmed its target price to 5.80 stg 
from 6.00, as it lowered earnings forecasts, citing higher interest costs.
The broker cut its full-year 2008 EPS estimate on BA to 52.9 pence from 55.5 pence, and for 2009 estimates to 
58.1 pence from 60 pence, assuming BA pays a 350 mln stg fine following the price-fixing investigations.
Citigroup also reiterated its 'buy' stance on Ryanair and cut its target price to 6.30 eur from 7.20, as it also lowered 
earnings forecasts on a softer pricing outlook.
The broker said it still sees a strong underlying business and fundamentals at Ryanair and advises buying on 
current share price weakness.
Elsewhere Citigroup also cut is target price on Air France-KLM to 38.20 eur from 39.40 and maintained its 'hold' 
stance as it cited fuel prices for lowering earnings forecasts.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings said it is buying 27 more Boeing Co 737-800 jets 
worth 1.9 bln usd.
The Dublin-based carrier said the deal brings its total firm orders for 737-800 jets to 308 and total fleet size, 
including planned disposals, to 262 by 2012.
Ryanair, which along with other airlines has faced criticism for adding to carbon emissions with increased numbers 
of flights, said the new aircraft will be fitted with Boeing blended winglets, which will further reduce fuel burn and 
CO2 emissions.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Nasdaq 100 fell Wednesday, dragged down by Ryanair Holdings plc, Marvell Technology 
Group Ltd. and Qualcomm Inc.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell 
1.78 points to 1,898.01. The broader Nasdaq composite declined 2.8 points to 2,569.34.
Shares of Ryanair, an Irish discount airline, fell $1.45, or 3.5 percent, to $39.58, as oil prices rose.
Marvell Technology Group, a chipmaker, gave up 42 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $15.51.
Qualcomm lost 99 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $43.15. Late during Tuesday's trading session, the company said a 
federal jury in Santa Ana, Calif., found that its products violated three patents owned by wireless technology rival 
Broadcom Corp.
On the rising side, Joy Global Inc. advanced $3.64, or 7.2 percent, to $54.45 after the company impressed 
investors with higher second-quarter orders, despite missing sales and profit expectations.
Biogen Idec Inc. climbed $2.66, or 5.4 percent, to $51.87 after the biotechnology company said it will buy back 
about 16 percent of outstanding shares, totaling $3 billion.
VeriSign Inc. added $1.51, or 5.4 percent, to $29.45. During Tuesday's trading day, the company said Chief 
Executive Stratton Sclavos resigned for undisclosed reasons.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Nasdaq 100 finished higher Wednesday, as gains by Joy Global Inc., Garmin Ltd., and 
Biogen Idec Inc. helped reverse a decline in the index earlier in the trading session.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 
18.29 points to 1,918.08. The broader Nasdaq composite rose 20.53 points to 2,592.59.
Joy Global shares advanced $4.95, or 9.7 percent, to $55.76 following the company's second-quarter earnings 
report. The heavy equipment maker reported sales and earnings that missed analyst expectations, but investors 
focused Joy Global's higher second-quarter orders.
Shares of Garmin, which makes navigation devices that use global positioning system technology, rose $4.52, or 
7.5 percent, to $64.98. Earlier in the session, shares hit a new 52-week high of $65.
Biogen shares climbed $2.92, or 5.9 percent, to $52.13 after the biotechnology company authorized a buyback of 
about 16 percent of the company's outstanding shares.
On the losing side, Qualcomm Inc. lost $1.32, or 3 percent, to $42.82. A federal jury on Tuesday found that 
Qualcomm's chips for cell phones violated three patents owned by rival Broadcom Corp.
Ryanair Holdings, an Irish discount airline, fell $1.03, or 2.5 percent, to $40, as oil prices rose.
Marvell Technology Group shares lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.57, following many other chip makers lower.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Shares in Ryanair IE have been given a reduced price target of 6.6 eur from 7.2 by 
HSBC, but the broker has reiterated its 'overweight' recommendation, as it believes there are reasons to be 
positive.
In a note this morning, HSBC said it believes recent yield fears for the airline business have been overstated and 
have created a buying opportunity, it feels falling yields rarely signal falling margins.
The broker added that, although it has lowered its price target, this still leaves a 22 pct upside potential and the 
broker remains positive on the stock.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings said it is opening its 20th European base at 
Bristol International Airport in southwest England.

Bratislava in Slovakia, Budapest, Derry and Knock in Ireland, Dinard in France, Katowice, Poznan, Rzeszow and 
Wroclaw in Poland, Milan, Porto in Portugal, Riga in Latvia and Salzburg in Austria.
Ryanair said the move will increase the number of its routes from Bristol to 16 and should result in a doubling of the 
airline's passenger numbers at the airport to 2 mln in 2009 from around 1 mln in 2008.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - JetBird, the Dublin group aiming to be the first pan-European low-cost operator of 
executive jets, is negotiating to locate its first operating bases at London, Stansted, and Cologne/Bonn, according to 
a report in The Financial Times.
The group, founded by Dómhnal Slattery, the Irish entrepreneur and financier, is expected to announce today that it 
has recruited its first chief executive in Stefan Vilner, chief commercial officer of Sterling Airlines, the Scandinavian 
low-cost carrier, said the report.
The FT said the appointment is the latest indication of JetBird's intent to transform the European private jet market 
by introducing a much lower cost air taxi service. It aims to lead its operations from several hubs across Europe to a 
network of about 75 airports.
The report said JetBird plans later hubs in France, Italy and Switzerland as it seeks to bring lessons from the 
operating models of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet to the private jet market.

The group, founded by Dómhnal Slattery, the Irish entrepreneur and financier, is expected to announce today that it 
has recruited its first chief executive in Stefan Vilner, chief commercial officer of Sterling Airlines, the Scandinavian 
low-cost carrier, said the report.
The FT said the appointment is the latest indication of JetBird's intent to transform the European private jet market 
by introducing a much lower cost air taxi service. It aims to lead its operations from several hubs across Europe to a 
network of about 75 airports.
The report said JetBird plans later hubs in France, Italy and Switzerland as it seeks to bring lessons from the 
operating models of low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet to the private jet market.

NEW YORK (AP) - A strong earnings report from Intuit Inc. boosted the Nasdaq 100 Friday, although drug maker 
Sepracor Inc., also a component of the index, fell due to possible cuts to government reimbursements for one of its 
products.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 
11.86 points to 1,896.54 in midday trading. The broader Nasdaq composite advanced 5.05 points to 2,544.43.
Intuit rose $3.58, or 12.9 percent, to $31.29 after the personal finance software maker beat analyst projections for 
third-quarter profit, saying it cracked $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time.
Akamai Technologies Inc. added $1.22, or 2.8 percent, to $44.43 after a Citigroup analyst said the stock's recent 
fall presents a good chance to buy shares.
Shares of search engine and Web portal operator Yahoo Inc. climbed 76 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $29.34.
On the declining side, Sepracor fell $7.70, or 14.7 percent, to $44.60. A Goldman Sachs analyst said a report on 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Web site indicates changes to reimbursement for Sepracor's asthma 
drug Xopenex, which could lower the selling price of the drug as soon as July 1.
Ryanair Holdings PLC fell 99 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $40.80.
Juniper Networks Inc. gave up 45 cents to $23.24 after a Citigroup analyst cut his rating on the stock to 'Hold' from 
'Buy,' saying the stock is overpriced.

OUTLOOK BA set to post lower FY pretax profits after turbulent year

(Updates outlook first published on 14th May, to add details on BA's efforts to bid for Iberia)
LONDON (Thomson Financial) - British Airways PLC is expected to draw a line under a turbulent year tomorrow 
when it reports an 8 pct drop in FY pretax profits, analysts said.
Forecasts for pretax income for the year to end of March stretch from 468 mln stg to 692 mln stg, with a consensus 
of 548 mln stg, according to 14 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.
The disparity in the numbers is partly due to the write-down on the sale of BA Connect, which has not been stripped 
out of some forecasts, Collins Stewart said.
But the airline was also hit by a number of extraordinary items during the year, including security disruption in 
August, fog in December and a threatened cabin crew strike in January.
At its investor day in March, management said BA is on target to meet forecasts, so the focus will likely be on 
adjusting the exceptionals to a clean underlying profits base and an update on the trading environment, Collins 
Stewart said.
BA's low-cost rivals easyJet and Ryanair warned of softening yields last month, so investors will be looking at yield 
and cost development in the last quarter, and guidance to the revenue outlook.
'It's not entirely clear whether the 'weaker market conditions' have been self inflicted by the low cost sector, due to 
unprecedented levels of new capacity,' Collins Stewart said. 'However, with BA's most recent traffic update referring 
to continued softness in long-haul non-premium, traffic outlook will be a key focus.'
There will also be interest in the premium business sector and the transatlantic routes, which are believed to be 
significant cost drivers for the airline, Barclays Wealth said in a note.
With less than a year to go before the opening of Heathrow's Terminal 5, which will be dedicated to BA, the market 
will also be looking for guidance on the costs of the move and the expected benefits in terms of cost savings and 
revenue from 2008-09, it added.
News of a bid for Iberia could also coincide with today's results. BA, which owns a 10 pct stake in the Spanish 
carrier, is thought to be considering a joint offer with private equity firm Texas Pacific Group.
OUTLOOK BA set to post lower FY pretax profits after turbulent year
However, BA is understood to be pushing for the inclusion of Apax Partners, another private equity firm, in the TPG-
led consortium, a move which could upset TPG and put its involvement in doubt.

MILAN (Thomson Financial) - Italy's infrastructure minister Antonio Di Pietro said the bids for Alitalia SpA from Italy 
AP Holding, which owns the Air One airline, and a Texas Pacific consortium are 'highly competitive'.
Yesterday, the government cleared all three remaining bidders in the privatisation of the government's stake for the 
next stage of filing binding offers, after access to Alitalia data.
'I have personally examined the offers and there are at least two which are highly competitive, both of which can be 
improved upon,' said Di Pietro.
'From one side there is Air One, from the other an international fund that in the last 10-15 years has restructuring 
big companies,' he said, without specifically citing Texas Pacific.
Texas Pacific has turned around US airlines, is a major shareholder in Ryanair Holdings PLC, and is trying to 
acquire Qantas.
Texas Pacific's consortium includes the US distressed company fund Matlin Patterson and Mediobanca SpA.
Di Pietro made no mention of the third bidder the consortium of Unicredito Italiano SpA and Aeroflot Russia Airline.
Di Pietro said the 'game for Alitalia is still all to play for' and the contenders can improve their offers.
'What interests the government is a business plan that includes a re-launch of the company, including a vision of 
the market, but an airline which is also an Italian flag carrier,' he said.
'This is not to say that the operation has to be done by a bidder with an Italian passport,' he said, referring to the 
bidders' origins.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - British Airways PLC is expected to draw a line under a turbulent year on Friday 
when it reports an 8 pct drop in FY pretax profits, analysts said.
Forecasts for pretax income for the year to end of March range from 468 mln stg to 692 mln stg, with a consensus 
of 548 mln stg, according to 14 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.
The disparity in the numbers is partly due to the write-down on the sale of BA Connect, which has not been stripped 
out of some forecasts, Collins Stewart said.
But the airline was also hit by a number of extraordinary items during the year, including security disruption in 
August, fog in December and a threatened cabin crew strike in January.
At its investor day in March, management said BA is on target to meet forecasts, so the focus will likely be on 
adjusting the exceptionals to a clean underlying profits base and an update on the trading environment, Collins 
Stewart said.
BA's low-cost rivals easyJet and Ryanair warned of softening yields last month, so investors will be looking at yield 
and cost development in the last quarter, and guidance to the revenue outlook.
'It's not entirely clear whether the 'weaker market conditions' have been self inflicted by the low cost sector, due to 
unprecedented levels of new capacity,' Collins Stewart said. 'However, with BA's most recent traffic update referring 
to continued softness in long-haul non-premium, traffic outlook will be a key focus.'
There will also be interest in the premium business sector and the transatlantic routes, which are believed to be 
significant cost drivers for the airline, Barclays Wealth said in a note.
With less than a year to go before the opening of Heathrow's Terminal 5, which will be dedicated to BA, the market 
will also be looking for guidance on the costs of the move and the expected benefits in terms of cost savings and 
revenue from 2008-09, it added.
News of a bid for Iberia could also coincide with the results. BA has already ruled out increasing its investment in 
the Spanish carrier, but press reports say a joint bid with Texas Pacific Group and Spanish risk capital groups could 
be imminent.

resolved during the first-phase inquiry.

inquiries last one month, but are extended by two weeks when companies offer remedies or when a national

may be submitted as a candidate for the EU's simplified merger procedure, a reduced regulatory process. 
The commission is entitled to transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.

The commission opens in-depth probes, lasting up to four months, if competition concerns cannot be 
resolved during the first-phase inquiry.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Shares in easyJet were upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' with a raised target of 733 
pence from 703 at Deutsche Bank on valuation grounds, dealers said.
Deutsche Bank said it has had a detailed look at the summer 2007 short-haul capacity environment and sees 
market capacity growth of 10 pct.
It argued that competition is largely being driven by Ryanair and Spanair's capacity growth with little evidence of 
other carriers growing irrationally.
It thinks the market has overcooked and overlooked the critical issue -- a stiff comparable period from good trading 
last summer, and for these reasons it believes market fears of sustained yield declines are overplayed.

PRESS COMMENT
FT
Thomson Financial UK at a glance share guide
THE LEX COLUMN: ABN Amro (ABN shareholders should not view Bank of America's legal threats as the decisive 
factor in the bid battle); Allianz (Allianz can learn from its buy-back mistake without hurting shareholders); Mining 
M&A (the message to mining executives is that getting together, and reaping synergies, is the way to be rewarded); 
Toyota (Wringing more savings out of suppliers is tough, although Japanese steelmakers' fear of unsolicited 
takeover bids gives carmakers some fresh leverage); South Africa (in the foreseeable future, South Africa makes an 
unlikely tiger economy. Buy pessimists have been proved wrong before) -- Markets: Standard Chartered (vague talk 
of a 21 stg a share bid from China or the Middle East); Enterprise Inns (rumours of stake-building by a property 
investor); WPP (talk firm is looking at a large acquisition in the US); Ladbrokes (talk of a 480 pence a share offer 
from Apax Partners)
Express
SHARE WHISPER: Osmetech (talk co. could be a 60 mln stg bid target) - Market Report: FKI (private equity bid 
talk); The Restaurant Group (talk co. could be taken private); Landore Resources (talk of a positive drilling update)
Mail
Market Report: Schroders (talk activist fund manager David Herro is becoming a trifle impatient with the board's 
'inactivity'); Ladbrokes (talk of a 500 pence-plus cash offer from Apax Partners)
Independent
THE INVESTMENT COLUMN: Savills (Buy); N Brown (Buy); Prodesse Investments (Buy for income) -- Market 
Report: Ladbrokes (talk of 440 pence a share bid from Apax Partners)
Guardian
Market Forces: Ladbrokes (talk of 440 pence a share bid from Apax Partners)
Times
Rumour of the day: Could there be another round of profit warnings from the personal insolvency sector? - Tempus: 
N Brown (buy); C&C Group (worth buying); Fenner (should be held) - Large Caps: Enterprise Inns (REIT 
conversion talk); Ladbrokes (Apax bid gossip)
Telegraph
QUESTOR: N Brown (keep buying); Lloyds TSB (Buy); Sage (hold)

to close up overnight as the Fed chose to keep interest rates unchanged, while investors will today be looking to the 
Bank of England for its own interest rate decision, dealers said.

OUTLOOK easyJet set for H1 growth despite Air Passenger Duty concerns

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - No-frills airline easyJet is widely tipped to see its year-on-year H1 2007 pretax 
profits rise by around 45 pct on the back of significant capacity growth, when it unveils its interim results today.
The airline's EPS is expected to increase by 6 pct, with its shares currently trading 15 pct above the level many 
analysts believe is a fair value for the carrier.
In a note, Andrew Fitchie, a research analyst at Collins Stewart said 'upgrades are necessary to sustain the shares 
at current levels.'
easyJet's Irish rival Ryanair Holdings PLC recently revealed its load factor -- how full its planes were -- declined by 
two percentage points on the back of the doubling of air passenger duty and other charges. As such, there is 
thought to be a chance easyJet could fail to impress.
'There has been no hint before now of widespread demand softness, but following Ryanair's comments there is 
scope for disappointment,' said Fitchie.
Douglas McNeill, a transport sector equity analyst at stockbroker Corporate Synergy told Thomson Financial News 
'suspicions are growing that the recent rise in air passenger duty is affecting customer behaviour across the 
industry to a greater extent than was expected.'
UBS transport analyst Tim Marshall, however, believes easyJet is more than capable of reporting year-on-year 
pretax profit growth of beyond 65 pct since it added a range of new routes to its portfolio last year.
'The current company guidance is for PBT to increase by 40 pct to 50 pct compared to last year but we think this 
now looks too cautious despite the higher capacity growth in the second half of the year,' wrote Marshall in a 
research note.

Ryanair 's O'Leary says he will appeal if EU blocks its bid for Aer Lingus

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings PLC will appeal if the EU opposes its hostile takeover bid for 
Irish carrier Aer Lingus when it concludes its inquiry in July, chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
'The EU will rule in the interests of the Irish government rather than the consumer,' he said. 'We hope they will 
approve (the deal) but we suspect they won't, in which case we will immediately appeal to the European Court.'
A verdict against Ryanair's lapsed bid would be 'purely political', in light of the approval of Air France's tie-up with 
KLM and Flybe's recent takeover of BA Connect, O'Leary said at a press conference in London.
Aer Lingus today announced it is increasing its fuel surcharges to 100 eur from 70 eur for a return trip across the 
Atlantic. Ryanair had promised to scrap these charges in its offer document submitted to the EU, he added.
O'Leary's comments came as the airline launched a price promotion, with 10 mln seats across Europe on sale for 
prices from 10 stg each including taxes, in response to the recent softening in passenger yields.
'We're launching our latest price war across Europe,' O'Leary said.
The market 'over-reacted' to the softening of yields and the recent two percentage point decline in the airline's load 
factor to 83 pct in April, he said.
'We are still growing capacity and responding aggressively with lower fares and price promotions,' he said.
The low-cost airline is also quoting prices inclusive of tax on its website for the first time, and says it will pay double 
the difference in fares if passengers find a cheaper fare on the same route with any other airline.

OUTLOOK easyJet set for H1 growth despite Air Passenger Duty concerns
OUTLOOK easyJet set for H1 growth despite Air Passenger Duty concerns
AFX - Asia

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - No-frills airline easyJet is widely tipped to see its year-on-year H1 2007 pretax 
profits rise by around 45 pct on the back of significant capacity growth, when it unveils its interim results on 
Wednesday.
The airline's EPS is expected to increase by 6 pct, with its shares currently trading 15 pct above the level many 
analysts believe is a fair value for the carrier.
In a note, Andrew Fitchie, a research analyst at Collins Stewart said 'upgrades are necessary to sustain the shares 
at current levels.'
easyJet's Irish rival Ryanair Holdings PLC last week revealed its load factor -- how full its planes were -- declined by 
two percentage points on the back of the doubling of air passenger duty and other charges. As such, there is 
thought to be a chance easyJet could fail to impress.
'There has been no hint before now of widespread demand softness, but following Ryanair's comments there is 
scope for disappointment,' said Fitchie.
Douglas McNeill, a transport sector equity analyst at stockbroker Corporate Synergy told Thomson Financial News 
'suspicions are growing that the recent rise in air passenger duty is affecting customer behaviour across the 
industry to a greater extent than was expected.'
UBS transport analyst Tim Marshall, however, believes easyJet is more than capable of reporting year-on-year 
pretax profit growth of beyond 65 pct since it added a range of new routes to its portfolio last year.
'The current company guidance is for PBT to increase by 40 pct to 50 pct compared to last year but we think this 
now looks too cautious despite the higher capacity growth in the second half of the year,' wrote Marshall in a 
research note.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - No-frills airline easyJet is widely tipped to see its year-on-year H1 2007 pretax 
profits rise by around 45 pct on the back of significant capacity growth, when it unveils its interim results on 
Wednesday.
The airline's EPS is expected to increase by 6 pct, with its shares currently trading 15 pct above the level many 
analysts believe is a fair value for the carrier.
In a note, Andrew Fitchie, a research analyst at Collins Stewart said 'upgrades are necessary to sustain the shares 
at current levels.'
easyJet's Irish rival Ryanair Holdings PLC last week revealed its load factor -- how full its planes were -- declined by 
two percentage points on the back of the doubling of air passenger duty and other charges. As such, there is 
thought to be a chance easyJet could fail to impress.
'There has been no hint before now of widespread demand softness, but following Ryanair's comments there is 
scope for disappointment,' said Fitchie.
Douglas McNeill, a transport sector equity analyst at stockbroker Corporate Synergy told Thomson Financial News 
'suspicions are growing that the recent rise in air passenger duty is affecting customer behaviour across the 
industry to a greater extent than was expected.'
UBS transport analyst Tim Marshall, however, believes easyJet is more than capable of reporting year-on-year 
pretax profit growth of beyond 65 pct since it added a range of new routes to its portfolio last year.
'The current company guidance is for PBT to increase by 40 pct to 50 pct compared to last year but we think this 
now looks too cautious despite the higher capacity growth in the second half of the year,' wrote Marshall in a 
research note.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Nasdaq 100 rose slightly Friday, after media reports saying Microsoft Corp. wants to buy 
Yahoo Inc. sent shares of the search-engine operator climbing.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 
5.6 points to 1,901.24. The broader Nasdaq composite advanced 8.74 points to 2,574.20.
Yahoo gained $5.20, or 18.5 percent, to $33.38. Analysts said a deal between the two companies would better 
position the combined entity to battle Google Inc. for online advertising dollars.
Akamai Technologies Inc., which makes technology that allows companies to deliver online ads, advanced $1.55, 
or 3.5 percent, to $45.92 on excitement related to the deal.
On the declining side, Ryanair Holdings plc shed $1.72, or 3.9 percent, to $42.70, a second day of declines after 
the Irish low-cost carrier warned of softer fare trends. In addition, the European Commission on Friday extended its 
deadline to rule on the company's proposed 1.48 billion euro ($1.9 billion) hostile takeover bid for fellow Irish airline 
Aer Lingus PLC.
Sears Holdings Corp. gave up $6.68, or 3.6 percent, to $181.64 after the operator of Sears and Kmart stores gave 
a first-quarter forecast below analyst expectations.
Starbucks Corp. fell 87 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $30.75 on concerns of slowing growth following the coffee seller's 
second-quarter report.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Nasdaq 100 finished slightly higher Friday, helped by a rally in shares of Yahoo Inc. on 
reports that Microsoft Corp. sought to restart acquisition talks with the search engine operator.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, 
edged up .06 to 1,895.70. The broader Nasdaq composite rose 6.69 points to end at 2,572.15.
Yahoo gained $2.80, or 9.9 percent, to close at $30.98. Analysts said a deal between the two companies would 
better position the combined entity to battle Google Inc. for online advertising dollars. However, just after the market 
closed, the Wall Street Journal reported that talks between the companies over a possible combination are no 
longer active.
Akamai Technologies Inc., which makes technology that allows companies to deliver online ads, advanced $1.71, 
or 3.9 percent, to $46.08 on excitement related to the potential deal.
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. climbed nearly 3 percent as Lehman Brothers initiated coverage on the chip maker 
with an upbeat rating. Shares rose 50 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $17.60.
On the declining side, Ryanair Holdings PLC shed $3.15, or 7.1 percent, to $41.27, completing a second day of 
declines after the Irish low-cost carrier warned of soft airfare trends. The European Commission on Friday also 
extended its deadline to rule on the company's proposed 1.48 billion euro ($1.9 billion) hostile takeover bid for 
fellow Irish airline Aer Lingus PLC.
Sears Holdings Corp. gave up $8.56, or 4.6 percent, to $179.76 after the operator of Sears and Kmart stores issued

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission said the deadline for its inquiry into low-cost carrier 
Ryanair Holdings PLC's proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus Group PLC is extended to July 4.
The original deadline was May 11. It was then extended to June 13.
The commission extends deadlines by 15 working days when parties offer commitments in a bid to remove 
competition concerns more than 55 days after the launch of an in-depth inquiry.
Ryanair withdrew its 1.48 bln eur hostile takeover bid in December last year after the commission launched the in-
depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines.
Ryanair built up a 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid.
The deal has faced oppositions from other shareholders -- including the Irish government -- and unions.

SYDNEY (XFN-ASIA) - Singapore Airlines-backed budget carrier Tiger Airways will base itself in Melbourne when it 
enters the Australian aviation market, the Victoria state government said.
'Melbourne will host Tiger Airways' new Australian head office, facilities for aircraft maintenance and crew training, 
and its start-up fleet,' Victorian Premier Steve Bracks said in a statement.
He said it would generate up to a thousand jobs.
Tiger announced in February that it was seeking clearance from Canberra to begin operating in Australia before the 
end of this year.
In Singapore, the company said it 'went through a thorough and detailed selection process and chose Melbourne.
'The Air Operator's Certificate process is on track and we are now talking to a variety of cities about destination 
opportunities so that we can start planning our route network,' Tiger Airways chief executive Tony Davis said in a 
statement.
Davis added that the carrier is talking to a number of cities about the possibility of a second base in Australia.
During the first year of operations in Australia, the airline expects to carry about 2 mln passengers.
The airline's entry into the Melbourne market should boost tourism and put 'an end to the inflated fares being 
charged by the current airline duopoly,' the statement said, without mentioning the airlines refered to.
Currently the dominant player in the domestic market is Qantas Airways -- which has set up its own budget arm 
Jetstar -- and Virgin Blue.
Tiger Airways currently operates four flights a week from Darwin to Singapore and daily between Perth and 
Singapore.
In March, the local unit Tiger Airways Australia Pty Ltd was incorporated in Australia's Northern Territory state.

percent stake.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Nasdaq 100 rose Thursday, boosted in part by Monster Worldwide Inc., after the job Web 
site operator said its employment index showed a slight gain in online recruiting in April.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 
5.91 points to 1,895.64. The broader Nasdaq composite advanced 7.62 points to 2,565.46.
Monster shares rose $3.80, or 8.6 percent, to $47.83.
Patterson-UTI Energy shares added $1.46, or 6 percent, to $25.92, after the provider of onshore drilling services 
beat analysts' first-quarter earnings expectations.
Expeditors International of Washington Inc. shares rose $2.23, or 5.2 percent, to $45.13, a day after the company 
reported a sharply higher first-quarter profit, despite weaker freight demand in the transportation sector.
On the declining side, IAC/InterActiveCorp. fell $2.49, or 6.5 percent, to $36.10, following the company's first-
quarter report.
Ryanair Holdings plc shares fell $2.98, or 6.3 percent, to $44.42, after the Irish discount airline operator reported 
fewer filled seats, or a lower load factor, in April.
Wynn Resorts Ltd. shares lost $3.42, or 3.2 percent, to $103.63 after quarterly results from rivals MGM Mirage and 
Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. missed analyst expectations.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Nasdaq 100 rose Thursday, boosted by an upgrade of Symantec Corp. and cheery 
quarterly reports from Expeditors International of Washington Inc. and Patterson-UTI Energy Inc.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, rose 
6.43 points to 1,896.16. The broader Nasdaq composite advanced 8.44 points to 2,566.28.
Symantec, a security software maker, climbed $1.55, or 8.5 percent, to $19.71 after Jefferies & Co. analyst 
Katherine Egbert upgraded the stock to 'Buy' from 'Hold.'
Expeditors International of Washington added $2.73, or 6.4 percent, to $45.63 after reporting first-quarter income 
rose 13 percent, meeting analyst expectations, despite a difficult year-ago comparison.
Patterson-UTI Energy picked up $1.54, or 6.3 percent, to $26 after the provider of onshore drilling services beat 
first-quarter analyst earnings expectations despite a 27 percent decline in profit.
On the declining side, IAC/InterActiveCorp. fell $2.50, or 6.5 percent, to $36.09, as investors expressed 
disappointment with a first-quarter report from the owner of Citysearch and Ticketmaster.
Ryanair Holdings plc fell $2.42, or 5.1 percent, to $44.98 after the Irish discount airline operator in a filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission reported fewer filled seats, or a lower load factor, in April. The company said 
that's partially due to higher charges at U.K. airports, and said the softness will continue through the first and 
second quarters.
Wynn Resorts Ltd. shares lost $3.15, or 2.9 percent, to $103.90 after rivals MGM Mirage and Trump Entertainment 
Resorts Inc. missed analyst expectations with quarterly results.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - UBS raised its price target for easyJet to 900 pence from 800, and for Ryan Air to 
7.50 eur from 6.50, with the broker saying that the no-frills airlines' results should be catalysts for both stocks, 
dealers said.
In a note to clients, UBS said that each has relatively underperformed in the last two months, but with benign 
capacity growth in short-haul European operations it expects revenue to continue to be strong.
Easyjet's first-half results are due on May 9, and Ryanair's full-year results will be released on June 5.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings today faced criticism from UK lawmakers for 
refusing to attend a parliamentary hearing on passengers' experiences of air travel.
The chairman of the Commons transport select committee, Gwyneth Dunwoody, said the Dublin-based carrier had 
declined her invitation to attend the meeting in Parliament.
'We asked Ryanair to join us this afternoon and got an extraordinary reply, 'no way',' she said. 'We therefore take 
great pleasure in making this known to the public.'
Ryanair also faced criticism from airlines represented at the meeting, which included Virgin Atlantic, British Airways 
PLC, Easyjet PLC, Flybe and business airline Silverjet PLC.
Virgin Atlantic said it believed it was 'widely recognised that Ryanair had come in for a great deal of criticism for 
customer service' and that it was getting 'caught up' in regulation imposed as a result, although it did not cite 
examples.
'Regulation is not free, it costs money and at the end of the day customers pay for that,' said Virgin's director of 
external affairs and route development Barry Humphreys. 'It seems unfair that our passengers should end up 
paying for regulation caused by another airline.'
Ryanair was unrepentant about missing the hearing, saying in a statement that it 'had far better things to do than 
waste time at a House of Commons Committee'.
'(The committee) is itself wasting time talking about passengers attitudes to air travel at a time when Gordon Brown 
is busy stealing an additional 1 bln stg from UK passengers and visitors this year,' it said.
The company also defended it customer service record, telling Thomson Financial News that it has the best 
punctuality, fewest lost bags and least cancellations in the industry.

MILAN (Thomson Financial) - Alitalia SpA said it welcomed yesterday's EU commission ruling on public service 
obligations (PSO) on flights between Sardinia and Italy's mainland, enabling it to restart flights.
Alitalia filed its applications under PSO rules too late to fly on the 16 routes between the three Sardinian airports 
and the mainland, and has since code-shared with Italy's Meridiana.
'The (EU) conditions no longer make it possible for carriers in possession of the requisite qualifications to be 
excluded from such links, also providing protection from abusive competition,' it said.
Alitalia officials said they could not say which of the 16 routes it would like to apply for, though noted that pre-PSO, 
Alitalia had flown to Cagliari, Meridiana to Olbia, and AirOne to Alghero.
Alitalia said the commission's decision keeps PSO obligations, but allows whatever operators meeting their terms to 
fly the routes.
Yesterday, easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC welcomed the EU's ruling, saying they hoped to start flights to 
Sardinia.
Last year, easyjet had planned to start flights to Olbia from Milan but was stopped by the Italian air regulator, while 
Ryanair was already flying Rome to Alghero but had to stop its slights.
The Italian government has until August 1, 2007 to bring its current decree into line with the commission ruling.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Shares in Iberia Lineas Aereas De Espana have been downgraded to 'neutral' 
from 'overweight' at HSBC, but with a higher target price of 4.15 eur from 3.65, as part of a wider review of the 
European airlines sector, dealers said.
In a note to clients, HSBC said the supply-demand balance still looks good, but noted that a peak will come at some 
stage.
HSBC added therefore that a selective approach to stock-picking is needed at this point in the cycle.
The broker maintained its 'neutral' stance on British Airways and Air France-KLM but raised its target prices by 14 
pct to 570 pence, and 21 pct to 40 eur, respectively.
HSBC also reiterated its 'overweight' recommendation on Ryanair, Lufthansa and Easyjet.

in France.
Ryanair now has 29 bases and serves 44 destinations in 25 countries.

BRUSSELS (Thomson Financial) - The European Commission said it is 'premature' to comment on its in-depth 
inquiry into low-cost air carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC's proposed merger with Irish carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
'This merger has been notified to the European Commission. The Commission has started an in-depth investigation 
and has set a deadline of 13th June for taking a final decision. So any comments at this stage, on both (sides), are 
completely premature,' a spokeswoman told reporters here.
The response comes a day after reports cited Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary as saying he expects EU 
regulators to block the merger, but remains willing to challenge such a ruling in the courts.
Ryanair withdrew its 1.48 bln eur hostile takeover bid in December last year after the commission launched an in-
depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines.
Ryanair built up a 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid.
The deal has faced oppositions from other shareholders -- including the Irish government -- and unions.

LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings may start a no-frills transatlantic airline by the turn of the decade, 
according to the carrier's chief executive Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary told Flight International that the recently agreed open-skies deal had made the creation of a new airline 
possible. He said the new carrier would likely serve secondary US airports such as Baltimore, Providence in Rhode 
Island and New York Long Island Islip Macarthur with ticket prices starting at around 12 usd.
O'Leary told Flight International that he has already had speculative approaches from some US airports, adding that 
he is confident the venture would succeed.
'By mid 2009, we will be carrying 70 million passengers at 23 bases across Europe,' O'Leary told Flight 
International. 'It will be relatively straightforward for us to do a deal for 40 to 50 long-haul aircraft and connect these 
bases transatlantically. There would be no one to touch us.'
Flight International claims Ryanair's new operation would operate a fleet of 50 Airbus A350s or Beoing 787s, and 
would have a premium class pitched against the likes of British Airways and Virgin Atlantic.
The report says the new airline would be run separately from Ryanair, with its own executives and board, and a 
different name. There would be no cross-ticketing or connecting luggage, O'Leary added.
The venture is being pursued independently of attempts to take over fellow Irish carrier Aer Lingus, according to 
Flight International.

multiples

MILAN (Thomson Financial) - Italy's energy and telecom cable firm Prysmian SpA is expected to be valued at 
between 1.9-3.0 bln eur in its upcoming initial public offering, analysts said, comparing the firm to French peer 
Nexans.
Goldman Sachs bought the cable firm from Pirelli & C SpA in 2005 for 1.3 bln eur including debt, renamed it 
Prysmian and is expected to start selling shares in the IPO next week, they said.
'We are in the syndicate which is to sell the shares. Nexans is a close comparison,' said one analyst, who asked not 
to be named.
Valuations of Prysmian will include comparisons with the Dutch company Draka, which is more involved in telecom 
cables, rather than energy, and General Cable of the US, which is similar to Prysmian, he said.
A Milan analyst said applying Nexans' enterprise value (EV)/EBITDA multiple of nine times, based on 2006 
earnings, would give Prysmian an enterprise value of 3.4 bln eur, before deducting net debt.
Taking Prysmian's published end-2006 net debt of 879 mln eur, this would give a market capitalisation of around 
2.5 bln, he said.
Using a price/earnings multiple of 22 times, also based on 2006 earnings, gives a market capitalisation of 1.9 bln, 
he said.
However, analysts said Prysmian's valuation could rise based on prospects for growth in the cable sector, and 
because its margins have risen.
In February, Prysmian reported a sharp rise in 2006 results, including a net profit of 91 mln eur, up from 3 mln in 
2005, EBIT of 258 mln against 117 mln a year earlier, and EBITDA of 371 mln against 219 mln.
Sales were up 34 pct to 5.007 bln eur.
Analysts said telecom cables have recovered from the weakness in the sector in the early part of the decade, while 
energy cables are gaining because of expansion in that sector.
FOCUS Italy 's Prysmian valued 1.9-3.0 bln eur in IPO based on Nexans multiples
'Energy is the strongest growth area because of infrastructure pressure. There is a favourable environment for 
growth. Long-term, it is more questionable,' said Societe Generale's Gerard Moore.
Moore, who follows Nexans, said the French company trades on an EV/EBIT multiple of 11 times.
Using Moore's multiple and Prysmian's 2006 earnings would give the Italian firm an enterprise value of 2.838 bln 
eur and a 2 bln market capitalisation.
Analysts could not say if Prysmian would justify a higher or lower multiple than Nexans, though he noted the similar 
size and margins of the two firms.
Moore said he did not see Nexans' investors switching out of that firm to obtain stakes in Prysmian and cited trends 
in other sectors to justify this.
'If you look at Ryanair and easyjet, and software firms, it has not been the case that one takes investment away 
from the other,' he said.
Looking at Prysmian's valuation, one Milan analyst noted reports that the valuation could rise to 3 bln eur, and 
pointed out that Pirelli recently announced the sale of various warrants and other instruments linked to Prysmian to 
Goldman Sachs for 246 mln eur.
This warrant sale suggests a valuation of Prysmian of between twice Goldman's purchase price of 1.3 bln eur and 3 
bln, he said.
However, he said it is unclear what the basis for the warrant valuation is and what the impact of factors such as 
volatility and any dividend payments might be.
Prysmian's IPO has been cleared by the Milan bourse, while stock market regulator Consob is expected to rule 
today, market sources said.

MADRID (Thomson Financial) - Ryanair Holdings has accused Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA of blocking 
competition in its core Spanish market after the carrier filed a 2 mln eur suit against the Irish no frills airline following 
a Barcelona publicity campaign.
In a statement, Ryanair dismissed the action as 'Iberia's latest tactic to contribute to protect its dominance in the 
Spanish market.'
Ryanair added it expects to continue growing in Spain regardless and sees itself transporting 9 mln passengers to 
and from Spanish destinations in 2007.
Iberia's suit, filed with a Madrid trade court, follows a publicity stunt carried out by Ryanair in September 2006, 
offering free tickets to people who carried placards stating why they would prefer to fly Ryanair over Iberia.
'Ryanair did not write the placards, Spanish consumers did, who were clearly expressing their preference for one 
airline over another,' Ryanair said.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in European Airlines were rerated at Deutsche Bank this morning as the broker focuses 
on valuations that provide some downside protection, dealers said.
Deutsche Bank said that it is raising Air France from 'hold' to 'buy' and raising British Airways from 'sell' to 'hold'.
It maintains a 'hold' on Lufthansa, and with limited valuation support outside bid multiples it downgrades Alitalia to 
'sell'.
It maintains a 'buy' rating on Air Berlin, easyJet and Vueling, and raises Ryanair from 'sell' to 'hold', principally 
reflecting the good trading environment and a more positive view from the broker generally on the logic of applying 
seat-only principles to long-haul travel.
Deutsche Bank said that it is now moving back to a generally positive stance, and it sees the key risks to be: an 
uncertain macro environment, fuel prices, a big rise in carbon prices and the capital cost to the industry generally of 
fleet renewals.

LONDON (AFX) - London shares were higher midafternoon, as investors breathed a sigh of relief following the 
BoE's decision to keep rates unchanged, and shrugged off a lower start on trading on Wall Street, dealers said.
By 3.10 pm, the FTSE 100 index was 22.0 points higher at 6,386.5, with the broader FTSE indices mixed.
Volume was moderate ahead of the 4-day break, with 1.75 bln shares changing hands in 323,373 deals.
Wall Street dipped in early trading Thursday, pausing after its recent gains and before Friday's release of key 
employment figures used to gauge the overall economy.
Investors traded cautiously since the stock market is closed on Friday for the Easter holiday. The pullback followed 
three straight days of gains.
There was little reaction to a US Labor Department report that first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose to 
their highest weekly level since March 3. Instead, Wall Street remained focused on the federal government's March 
jobs report -- released on a day where there is no trading, which sets up Monday as a possibly critical day for 
stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.37 to 12,521.68, with the broader stock indicators also weaker with the 
Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 2.26 at 1,437.11, and the Nasdaq composite index shedding 1.40 to 
2,457.29.
On the data front, ahead of tomorrow's report, jobless claims are seen rebounding to 315,000 in the latest week, 
after having fallen to 308,000 in the prior week.
Rising oil prices could also weigh on US sentiment, with the crude oil price hovering back up around 64.5 usd a 
barrel after yesterday's disappointing data on oil stockpiles in the US.
In London, shares recovered earlier losses after the BoE decided to leave interest rates at 5.25 pct, as expected.
On the corporate front, in the absence of any real news, broker comment provided the main corporate interest.
London shares firmer midafternoon, DJIA dips at open, BoE leaves rates unchanged
On the upside, Old Mutual was one of the top FTSE 100 gainers, up 3.8 pence at 170.3 after Citigroup hiked its 
rating to 'buy' from 'hold' with a raised price target of 188 pence, up from 187.
Citigroup said it feels the company's risk/reward profile is now starting to look more attractive.
Meanwhile, British Airways added 2-1/2 pence at 509-1/2, extending gains following yesterday's solid March traffic 
numbers and aided by news of an upgrade to 'hold' from 'sell' by Deutsche Bank in a European airlines review.
Deutsche Bank also made a similar hike in rating for Ryanair as it focused on valuations that provide some 
downside protection.
InterContinental Hotels also found support too, up 6 pence at 1,284 after JP Morgan hiked its target price to 1,420 
pence from 1,073 and reiterated its 'overweight' stance on the firm.
The broker said, in its view, InterContinental's highly attractive operating model, valuation discount to peers, strong 
pipeline and value release potential from the final tranche of asset sales should continue to drive outperformance in 
2007.
Oil & gas plays also offered support, with BP up 4-1/2 pence at 552-1/2, Royal Dutch Shell 12 higher at 1,687 and 
BG Group 2-1/2 ahead at 730-1/2, tracking oil price strength.
On the downside, Scottish & Newcastle were among the fallers, with a fall of 4 pence to 602, as brokers 
downgraded the stock, citing bid uncertainties following recent speculation.
Dresdner Kleinwort this morning downgraded the brewer to 'reduce' from 'hold' and ING cut its stance to 'sell' from 
'hold'.
DK told clients that numerous names have been touted as potential bidders for S&N in the last week, but the broker 
thinks all seem highly unlikely.
Similarly, ING said it feels the market has been overly optimistic about a possible deal.
Staying on the M&A front, J Sainsbury gave back some of yesterday's late rally, shedding 1 pence at 561 as some 
of the froth evaporated on talk of the KKR pull-out.
People close to the situation believe that KKR has decided to withdraw from the CVC-led consortium because it 
feels it already has its hands full with its current bid for fellow retailer Alliance Boots PLC.
CVC was also linked in market rumours yesterday to a possible private equity buyout of Ladbrokes, the Daily 
Express market report noted, sending shares in the bookmaker 14-1/2 pence higher at 420-1/2 today.
Vodafone was on the back foot, 0.7 pence lower at 136, after announcing it is buying only 52 pct of Indian mobile 
operator Hutchison Essar but will have an 'economic interest' in 67 pct as it insisted the 11.1 bln usd deal is 
compliant with Indian foreign investment rules.
On the second line, with little else of excitement, Southern Cross Healthcare added 17 pence at 497 on news of an 
increase in price target by Morgan Stanley to 570 pence from 475.
The US broker reiterated its 'overweight' stance on Southern Cross and raised its estimates.
And among the mid-cap fallers, Mitchells & Butlers slipped 14 pence at 779-1/2 on the back of a downgrade to 
'neutral' from 'buy' at Merrill Lynch on valuation grounds following a rally in the share price.
In a note to clients, Merrill said it downgraded the stock as Mitchells has exceeded its former 750 pence target 
price, adding that it cannot get to 880 pence per share on a 12-month view.
London shares firmer midafternoon, DJIA dips at open, BoE leaves rates unchanged
Finally, SSL International slipped 1-1/4 pence to 424-3/4, following a surge in its share price yesterday on bid 
rumours, prompting Evolution Securities to repeat its 'reduce' stance and 365 pence target price.

LONDON (AFX) - London shares were higher midafternoon, as investors breathed a sigh of relief following the 
BoE's decision to keep rates unchanged, and shrugged off a lower start on trading on Wall Street, dealers said.
By 3.10 pm, the FTSE 100 index was 22.0 points higher at 6,386.5, with the broader FTSE indices mixed.
Volume was moderate ahead of the 4-day break, with 1.75 bln shares changing hands in 323,373 deals.
Wall Street dipped in early trading Thursday, pausing after its recent gains and before Friday's release of key 
employment figures used to gauge the overall economy.
Investors traded cautiously since the stock market is closed on Friday for the Easter holiday. The pullback followed 
three straight days of gains.
There was little reaction to a US Labor Department report that first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose to 
their highest weekly level since March 3. Instead, Wall Street remained focused on the federal government's March 
jobs report -- released on a day where there is no trading, which sets up Monday as a possibly critical day for 
stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.37 to 12,521.68, with the broader stock indicators also weaker with the 
Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 2.26 at 1,437.11, and the Nasdaq composite index shedding 1.40 to 
2,457.29.
On the data front, ahead of tomorrow's report, jobless claims are seen rebounding to 315,000 in the latest week, 
after having fallen to 308,000 in the prior week.
Rising oil prices could also weigh on US sentiment, with the crude oil price hovering back up around 64.5 usd a 
barrel after yesterday's disappointing data on oil stockpiles in the US.
In London, shares recovered earlier losses after the BoE decided to leave interest rates at 5.25 pct, as expected.
On the corporate front, in the absence of any real news, broker comment provided the main corporate interest.

On the upside, Old Mutual was one of the top FTSE 100 gainers, up 3.8 pence at 170.3 after Citigroup hiked its 
rating to 'buy' from 'hold' with a raised price target of 188 pence, up from 187.
Citigroup said it feels the company's risk/reward profile is now starting to look more attractive.
Meanwhile, British Airways added 2-1/2 pence at 509-1/2, extending gains following yesterday's solid March traffic 
numbers and aided by news of an upgrade to 'hold' from 'sell' by Deutsche Bank in a European airlines review.
Deutsche Bank also made a similar hike in rating for Ryanair as it focused on valuations that provide some 
downside protection.
InterContinental Hotels also found support too, up 6 pence at 1,284 after JP Morgan hiked its target price to 1,420 
pence from 1,073 and reiterated its 'overweight' stance on the firm.
The broker said, in its view, InterContinental's highly attractive operating model, valuation discount to peers, strong 
pipeline and value release potential from the final tranche of asset sales should continue to drive outperformance in 
2007.
Oil & gas plays also offered support, with BP up 4-1/2 pence at 552-1/2, Royal Dutch Shell 12 higher at 1,687 and 
BG Group 2-1/2 ahead at 730-1/2, tracking oil price strength.
On the downside, Scottish & Newcastle were among the fallers, with a fall of 4 pence to 602, as brokers 
downgraded the stock, citing bid uncertainties following recent speculation.
Dresdner Kleinwort this morning downgraded the brewer to 'reduce' from 'hold' and ING cut its stance to 'sell' from 
'hold'.
DK told clients that numerous names have been touted as potential bidders for S&N in the last week, but the broker 
thinks all seem highly unlikely.
Similarly, ING said it feels the market has been overly optimistic about a possible deal.
Staying on the M&A front, J Sainsbury gave back some of yesterday's late rally, shedding 1 pence at 561 as some 
of the froth evaporated on talk of the KKR pull-out.
People close to the situation believe that KKR has decided to withdraw from the CVC-led consortium because it 
feels it already has its hands full with its current bid for fellow retailer Alliance Boots PLC.
CVC was also linked in market rumours yesterday to a possible private equity buyout of Ladbrokes, the Daily 
Express market report noted, sending shares in the bookmaker 14-1/2 pence higher at 420-1/2 today.
Vodafone was on the back foot, 0.7 pence lower at 136, after announcing it is buying only 52 pct of Indian mobile 
operator Hutchison Essar but will have an 'economic interest' in 67 pct as it insisted the 11.1 bln usd deal is

LONDON (AFX) - London shares crept higher at midday as investors breathed a sigh of relief following the BoE's 
decision to keep rates unchanged, and shrugging off an expected lower start on Wall Street, dealers said.
At 12.05 pm, the FTSE 100 index was 11.0 points higher at 6,375.7, having recovered from a 14-point decline in 
midmorning deals, with the broader FTSE indices mixed.
Volume was average, with 1.05 bln shares changing hands in 182,367 deals.
Looking ahead to Wall Street, US stocks are expected to open lower ahead of tomorrow's key jobs report and with 
investors winding down ahead of the long Easter weekend.
Spread bettors IG Index expect the DJIA to open around 12 points lower at 12,515, consolidating after three 
consecutive sessions of gains. The DJIA closed 19.70 points higher yesterday at 12,530.00.
On the data front, ahead of tomorrow's report, jobless claims are seen rebounding to 315,000 in the latest week 
after having fallen to 308,000 in the prior week.

downgraded the stock, citing bid uncertainties following recent speculation.

Apart from the BoE decision elsewhere on the economic front, UK house prices saw the Halifax survey show an 
above-expectations rise in March.
Halifax said house prices rose by 1.0 pct on a seasonally adjusted basis in March, well above analysts' 
expectations of a much more modest 0.5 pct gain.
Investors also had UK February industrial production numbers to digest, with UK manufacturers suffering their worst 
month in over a year, according to official figures.
London shares gain midday as BoE keeps rates unchanged; Wall Street seen lower
The Office for National Statistics reported that manufacturing output, which accounts for 14.7 pct of the UK 
economy, fell by 0.6 pct in February from the previous month, in contrast to analysts' expectations for a 0.3 pct rise. 
February's performance was the worst since October 2005, when output fell a monthly 0.7 pct.

and aided by news of an upgrade to 'hold' from 'sell' by Deutsche Bank in a European airlines review.
Deutsche Bank also made a similar hike in rating for Ryanair as it focused on valuations that provide some 
downside protection.
London shares gain midday as BoE keeps rates unchanged; Wall Street seen lower
InterContinental Hotels also found support too, up 16 pence at 1,294 after JP Morgan hiked its target price to 1,420 
pence from 1,073 and reiterated its 'overweight' stance on the firm.
The broker said, in its view, InterContinental's highly attractive operating model, valuation discount to peers, strong 
pipeline and value release potential from the final tranche of asset sales should continue to drive outperformance in 
2007.
Oil & gas plays also offered support, with BP up 5-1/2 pence at 553-1/2, Royal Dutch Shell 11 higher at 1,686 and 
BG Group 3-1/2 ahead at 731-1/2, tracking oil price strength.
On the downside, Scottish & Newcastle were among the fallers, with a fall of 8 pence to 598, as brokers 
downgraded the stock, citing bid uncertainties following recent speculation.
Dresdner Kleinwort this morning downgraded the brewer to 'reduce' from 'hold' and ING cut its stance to 'sell' from 
'hold'.
DK told clients that numerous names have been touted as potential bidders for S&N in the last week, but the broker 
thinks all seem highly unlikely.
Similarly, ING said it feels the market has been overly optimistic about a possible deal.
Staying on the M&A front, J Sainsbury gave back some of yesterday's late rally, shedding 3-1/2 pence at 557-1/2 as 
some of the froth evaporated on talk of the KKR pull-out.
People close to the situation believe that KKR has decided to withdraw from the CVC-led consortium because it 
feels it already has its hands full with its current bid for fellow retailer Alliance Boots PLC.
CVC was also linked in market rumours yesterday to a possible private equity buyout of Ladbrokes, the Daily 
Express market report noted, sending shares in the bookmaker 14-1/2 pence higher at 420-1/2 today.
Vodafone was on the back foot, 1/2 pence lower at 136, after announcing it is buying only 52 pct of Indian mobile 
operator Hutchison Essar but will have an 'economic interest' in 67 pct as it insisted the 11.1 bln usd deal is 
compliant with Indian foreign investment rules.
On the second line, with little else of excitement, Southern Cross Healthcare were a top FTSE 250 leader, adding 
17 pence at 497 on news of an increase in price target by Morgan Stanley to 570 pence from 475.
The US broker reiterated its 'overweight' stance on Southern Cross and raised its estimates.
And among the mid-cap fallers, Mitchells & Butlers slipped 9 pence at 784-1/2 on the back of a downgrade to 
'neutral' from 'buy' at Merrill Lynch on valuation grounds following a rally in the share price.
In a note to clients, Merrill said it downgraded the stock as Mitchells has exceeded its former 750 pence target 
price, adding that it cannot get to 880 pence per share on a 12-month view.
Finally, SSL International slipped 1-1/4 pence to 424-3/4, following a surge in its share price yesterday on bid 
rumours, prompting Evolution Securities to repeat its 'reduce' stance and 365 pence target price.
Apart from the BoE decision elsewhere on the economic front, UK house prices saw the Halifax survey show an 
above-expectations rise in March.
Halifax said house prices rose by 1.0 pct on a seasonally adjusted basis in March, well above analysts' 
expectations of a much more modest 0.5 pct gain.
Investors also had UK February industrial production numbers to digest, with UK manufacturers suffering their worst 
month in over a year, according to official figures.
London shares gain midday as BoE keeps rates unchanged; Wall Street seen lower
The Office for National Statistics reported that manufacturing output, which accounts for 14.7 pct of the UK 
economy, fell by 0.6 pct in February from the previous month, in contrast to analysts' expectations for a 0.3 pct rise. 
February's performance was the worst since October 2005, when output fell a monthly 0.7 pct.

FRANKFURT (AFX) - German shares are expected to open little changed as analysts said mixed results on foreign 
indices have left the DAX without any definite direction.
The DJIA and Nasdaq closed higher on Friday, picking up most momentum after close of German exchanges, but 
the Nikkei 225 ended lower this morning.
Pre-bourse trade shows a fairly tight grouping with only DaimlerChrysler and Fresenius Medical Care as clear 
gainers.
At 8.11 am, brokerage Lang & Schwarz forecast the DAX 30 index to open about 5 points lower at 6,912. The DAX 
closed 19.95 points, or 0.28 pct, higher on Friday at 6,917.03.

FRANKFURT (AFX) - German shares are expected to open little changed as analysts said mixed results on foreign 
indices have left the DAX without any definite direction.
The DJIA and Nasdaq closed higher on Friday, picking up most momentum after close of German exchanges, but 
the Nikkei 225 ended lower this morning.
Pre-bourse trade shows a fairly tight grouping with only DaimlerChrysler and Fresenius Medical Care as clear 
gainers.
At 8.11 am, brokerage Lang & Schwarz forecast the DAX 30 index to open about 5 points lower at 6,912. The DAX 
closed 19.95 points, or 0.28 pct, higher on Friday at 6,917.03.

ROUNDUP BAA's supply of UK airport services referred to Competition Commission
ROUNDUP BAA's supply of UK airport services referred to Competition 
Commission

LONDON (AFX) - The UK's Office of Fair Trading said it referred the supply of airport services by BAA, a unit of 
Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA, to the Competition Commission following a period of public consultation.
It follows an announcement by the UK Civil Aviation Authority that it has submitted its tariffs to the Competition 
Commission.
The OFT decision follows its proposal last December to refer BAA to the Competition Commission. It first 
announced it was conducting a market study into the sector last June.
BAA, the operator of seven UK airports, said it welcomed the Competition Commission's review of the UK airport 
market and airport charges.
'Our analysis is that the fundamental problem for passengers is lack of capacity, not the structure of BAA,' said chief 
executive Stephen Nelson.
'Putting BAA in the dock for a complex set of problems -- with deep legacy causes -- will not help solve them,' he 
added.
The OFT said the majority of over 60 responses received from airlines, consumers and other organisations during 
its consultation supported referral of BAA to the commission.
The probe could potentially result in BAA having to sell one of its three main airports in the South East of England, 
where its airports handle 90 pct of passenger trips.
The CAA, which sets maximum airport charges and other price controls for BAA's Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and 
Manchester airports, also announced that it submitted its proposed price controls for Heathrow and Gatwick airports 
to the commission.
This is a key stage in the CAA's periodic review of price controls for these airports, which started in December 
2005, and culminates in new price controls for April 2008-2013.
The CAA's recommendations 'largely confirm the CAA's initial proposals', said Harry Bush, CAA group director, 
economic regulation.
ROUNDUP BAA's supply of UK airport services referred to Competition Commission
The authority said the indicative ranges for the maximum rate of increase in airport charges and its 
recommendations for the cost of capital remain the same as its initial proposals last December.
However, JP Morgan said the proposed tariffs are at the top end of the range initially proposed.
Budget airline easyJet called the CAA's recommendations 'a bad deal for air travellers, but great for BAA's new 
owners.'
'The CAA's proposal to allow BAA to increase charges above inflation at Gatwick every year -- instead of 
demanding real price cuts - is a step backwards and unwinds much of the good work of the CAA over the last few 
years,' easyJet said in a statement.
The main changes since CAA's initial proposal reflect a greater emphasis on the quality of services, such as a 
reduction in queuing time in security, and incremental bonuses for BAA if passenger services are significantly 
above agreed standards. However, they also include greater financial penalties on BAA where passenger service 
falls short.
'The CAA's proposals to increase the penalties for poor performance and to introduce rewards for improving 
performance are intended to sharpen further BAA's focus on the passenger,' it said in a statement.
The aviation authority also placed renewed emphasis on the airline operator's timely investment. It will pay bonuses 
to reward the completion of key projects but also plans to issue penalties if certain milestones are not met, although 
any penalties would likely be imposed in the following five-year pricing period.
The CAA proposes that BAA receive maximum bonuses worth 1.8 pct of airport charges if service quality standards 
are met, but also plans maximum rebates worth 4.5 pct of charges at Heathrow and about 4 pct of charges at 
Gatwick if they are not.
The CAA, which said it did not know about the OFT's plans until late last night, said it was difficult to speculate 
about the impact of the OFT's referral. However, its recommendations are 'relatively robust to a number of 
outcomes', said Bush at a news briefing.
'The price control recommendations are based on the current ownership structure of Heathrow, Gatwick and 
Stansted, and are likely to be robust to any future change in ownership,' the CAA also said in a report.
Low-cost airline Ryanair PLC said it welcomed the decisions, stating: 'The BAA monopoly should now be broken up 
to allow competition, improved services, lower airport costs and the development of sensible cost-efficient facilities 
where the current BAA monopoly and ineffective regulator (the CAA) have clearly failed.'
The CAA is required to set maximum limits on charges at BAA's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted and Manchester 
airports. It previously extended the price control period for Stansted and Manchester to March 2009.
At 2.03 pm, shares in Ferrovial were up 0.80 eur, or 1.07 pct, at 75.95, while the Ibex-35 index was up 10.9 points 
at 14,617.0.

VIENNA (AFX) - Shares in SkyEurope Holding AG crashed this afternoon after the company chief executive said he 
had no plans to payout a dividend to shareholders, dealers said.
At 2.58 pm, shares in SkyEurope were down 5.36 pct at 4.20 eur, while the ATX Prime was broadly flat, down 0.06 
pct or 1.42 points at 2,369.01.
Dealers said investors, who are largely foreign funds, reacted bearishly to the news, especially considering fellow 
low-cost carrier Ryanair had said last year it was looking into a number of options for returning 'a couple of hundred 
million euros' to shareholders by the end of 2007.
Speaking at the airline's annual general meeting this morning, Christian Mandl said SkyEurope would reinvest 
future profits rather than issue a dividend as low-cost airlines don't typically payout to shareholders.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Nasdaq composite recovered from an earlier dip to end slightly higher Monday, lifting its top 
100 stocks, which were helped by an upgrade for Dell Inc.
The Nasdaq 100, which includes 100 of the largest nonfinancial securities traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market,

months.
Among the index's decliners, Irish discount airline operator Ryanair Holdings PLC lost 92 cents, or 2 percent, to

UK BUDGET Government 'open to changing the definition' of new air tax

LONDON (AFX) - The UK government is 'open to changing the definition' of Air Passenger Duty (APD), according 
to the Treasury's full report on the 2007 Budget speech, which was made earlier today by the Chancellor Gordon 
Brown.
'The aviation industry has suggested to government that the way in which Air Passenger Duty defines different 
classes of travel may not always send the appropriate environmental signal and may cause market distortions, for 
example for 'business class only' flights and 'premium economy'-type seats,' the report said.
'The government is open to introducing changes to the definition, but only if it can be done on a broadly revenue 
neutral basis. The government will discuss further with industry how this can be achieved,' it added.
A Treasury spokeswoman this afternoon told AFX News that 'no timeframe has yet been placed on the discussions 
which will take place between the government and the [aviation] industry about the possible change of the definition 
of APD'.
In his pre-budget report in December 2006, Brown said APD rates would increase from Feb 1 2007.
Short-haul passengers in the lowest class of travel must now pay 10 stg, up from 5 stg, and in other classes they 
have to pay pay 20 stg, up from 10 stg. Long-haul passengers in the lowest class of travel now pay 40 stg, up from 
20 stg, and in others they pay 80 stg, up from 40 stg.
Low-cost airlines claim long-haul customers are being unfairly penalised because such airlines offer the opportunity 
to have a service, slightly above economy class, with extra leg room, which has proved popular with tall people. 
Passengers who opt for this service now have to stump up the 80 stg tax.
Brown has said the extra tax is designed to combat global warming, but some airlines, including low-cost-carriers 
Ryanair and easyJet, have described it as just another way of raising revenue for the Treasury.
The full 2007 budget report report stands by Brown's initial claims that APD will deliver substantial climate change 
savings, however.
'The government believes that air passenger duty plays a valuable role in ensuring that passengers understand and 
acknowledge the environmental costs of their actions,' the report said.
UK BUDGET Government 'open to changing the definition' of new air tax
'The resultant behaviour change can deliver significant climate change benefits: the decision announced in the 
2006 Pre-Budget Report to increase the rates of air passenger duty from 1 Feb 2007 will deliver climate change 
savings equivalent to around 0.75 MtC [million tonnes of carbon] per year by 2010-11.'

have to pay pay 20 stg, up from 10 stg. Long-haul passengers in the lowest class of travel now pay 40 stg, up from 
20 stg, and in others they pay 80 stg, up from 40 stg.
Low-cost airlines claim long-haul customers are being unfairly penalised because such airlines offer the opportunity 
to have a service, slightly above economy class, with extra leg room, which has proved popular with tall people. 
Passengers who opt for this service now have to stump up the 80 stg tax.
Brown has said the extra tax is designed to combat global warming, but some airlines, including low-cost-carriers 
Ryanair and easyJet, have described it as just another way of raising revenue for the Treasury.
The full 2007 budget report report stands by Brown's initial claims that APD will deliver substantial climate change 
savings, however.
'The government believes that air passenger duty plays a valuable role in ensuring that passengers understand and 
acknowledge the environmental costs of their actions,' the report said.
UK BUDGET Government 'open to changing the definition' of new air tax
'The resultant behaviour change can deliver significant climate change benefits: the decision announced in the 
2006 Pre-Budget Report to increase the rates of air passenger duty from 1 Feb 2007 will deliver climate change 
savings equivalent to around 0.75 MtC [million tonnes of carbon] per year by 2010-11.'

MADRID (AFX) - Shares in Vueling Airlines SA are set to rise in opening deals after Iberian Equities analysts 
initiated coverage of the no-frills airline with a 'buy' rating and 53.80 eur per share target price, dealers said.
The analysts noted Spain is now a 'big opportunity' for low-cost flyers, who represent just 33 pct of international 
passenger traffic and 5 pct of domestic traffic.
'We believe these market shares will rise further,' they said, adding Spain is increasingly attracting higher numbers 
of tourists who stay for shorter periods and spend less than they did previously.
Tourists also tend to book their own reservations instead of using package tours, which bodes well for the low-cost 
market, they noted.
'There is plenty of room for Vueling to grow... Iberia and Spanair do not have the appropriate cost structures to 
compete aggressively for any length of time, while Ryanair and Clickair each have their own limitations,' they said.
Spanish flag carrier Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA is also pulling back from the domestic market, analysts 
highlighted.
Vueling shares closed yesterday at 40.08 eur each.

NEW YORK (AP) - Shares of Southwest Airlines Co. moved higher Friday, after Raymond James upgraded its 
stock on expectations of growing revenue from sales of items other than airplane seats.
The Dallas-based low-cost carrier's shares added 10 cents to $14.99 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. It bucked an overall downward trend for airline stocks, as the Amex Airline Index dropped 1.1 percent 
due to rising crude oil prices and the effects of an East Coast snowstorm.
Raymond James analyst James D. Parker upgraded Southwest to 'Outperform' from 'Market Perform,' writing in a 
research report that the company has great potential in marketing ancillary services, such as car rentals and hotels. 
It could also begin onboard sales of tickets for theater shows, museums or other items.
Such ancillary sales make up only about 2 percent of Southwest's revenue, compared with 15 percent for Europe's 
largest low-fare carrier, Ryanair, Parker wrote.
'Ancillary sales, we believe, are on the verge of becoming pervasive in the airline industry because it enables 
airlines to diversify their revenue bases away from the commodity pricing of airline seats and to take advantage of 
the leverage they have to sell higher margin items to captive audiences,' he wrote.
Parker also cited Southwest's recent stock decline, saying it looks like a good company with its shares 'on sale' 
after a 17 percent decline over the past nine months.

NEW YORK (AP) - Airline stocks slipped Friday, as an East Coast snowstorm forced hundreds of cancellations.
Crude oil prices rose, offsetting a Raymond James upgrade of Southwest Airlines Co.
The Amex Airline Index fell nearly 1 percent, with nine of 11 components declining. A barrel of oil gained 21 cents to 
$57.76 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Jet fuel is one of an airline's top costs.
A late winter snowstorm forced cancellations across the Northeast. Among those grounding flights were JetBlue 
Airways Corp. and American Airlines. Most of the cancellations were in the New York area.
JetBlue shares slipped 16 cents to $11.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and American Airlines' parent, AMR Corp., 
fell 38 cents to $32.21 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The index's biggest gainer in early afternoon trading was Southwest, which added 10 cents at $15 on the NYSE.
Raymond James analyst James D. Parker upgraded the stock to 'Outperform' from 'Market Perform,' saying the 
company has great potential in marketing ancillary services, such as car rentals, hotels and onboard sale of food,

SYDNEY (XFN-ASIA) - Singapore-based low cost carrier Tiger Airways Ltd said Australia's Foreign Investment 
Review Board has approved its application to operate Australian domestic services.
The airline said in a statement that the FIRB has ruled the creation of Tiger Airways Australia to be consistent with 
foreign investment policy.
Tiger Airways chief executive Tony Davis said in a statement that the government authority has not placed any 
specific conditions on it.
'We are very encouraged by the support that we have received from so many communities across the country and 
the tens of thousands of Australians who have visited our website and voted for their preferred domestic routes,' 
Davis said.
Tiger Airways Australia still needs to obtain an air operator certificate from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority before 
it can start domestic services in Australia later this year.
The company said it is in the final stages of negotiations with several Australian airports for its main operating base 
and expects to make a decision on which airport will be its operating base within a few weeks.
Tiger, which began flying in 2004, is owned by four shareholders including Singapore Airlines which has a 49 pct 
stake, and state-linked Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings with 11 pct. Ireland's Tony Ryan, who 
founded low cost carrier Ryanair, has a 16 pct stake.
In February, Davis said the new airline would look at flying into small centers rather than just major cities, similar to 
the operations of Ryanair in Europe and Tiger services in Asia.

LONDON (AFX) - Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus PLC is tipped to see its full-year operating profit fall by some 8 pct to 
around the 66 mln eur when the airline unveils its 2006 results today.
Aer Lingus's 2005 operating profit came in at 72.4 mln eur but last year's figure is expected to have been dented by 
the bomb scares at the UK's airports last August.
Furthermore, analysts see the carrier's pretax profit falling by around 40 mln eur because of various restructuring 
costs and balancing the airline's pension fund deficit, which is likely to have cost around 120 mln eur.
The airline this morning reported a year-on-year rise in total passengers in Feb but said its load factor fell.
The total number of passengers carried last month rose 7.3 pct to 616,000 and was up 4.8 pct at 1.2 mln in the year 
to date.
The number of short-haul passengers rose 8.9 pct to 548,000 while long-haul fell 4.2 pct to 68,000.
Budget airline Ryanair PLC bid 2.80 eur per share last year for Aer Lingus, a 27 pct premium to the share price at 
the time of 2.20 eur, valuing the airline at 1.48 bln eur. The bid was subsequently withdrawn by Ryanair.
However, Ryanair later denied reports its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, had considered increasing the offer to 
3.10 eur a share.
The European Commission launched an inquiry in December into the initial offer, citing 'serious competition 
concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines.
The commission's decision has been postponed from May 11 until June 13 because it needs more time to consider 
the evidence, according to a Ryanair spokesperson.

LONDON (AFX) - Aer Lingus Group PLC has insisted it is on track to fight off a potential takeover from rival Ryanair 
Holdings, despite a 6.6 pct fall in annual profits to 76 mln eur due to higher fuel costs and last year's UK terror alert.
Finance director Greg O'Sullivan said the Irish flag carrier remains confident it can grow shareholder value as an 
independent airline despite the drop in operating profits before a staff profit share, which it blamed on a 39 pct rise 
in the price of a barrel of crude and three months' disruption from the discovery in August of an alleged plot to blow 
up transatlantic airliners.
Ryanair withdrew a 1.48 bln eur hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus in December last year after the European 
Commission launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of 
Ireland's two biggest airlines.
German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung yesterday quoted Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary as saying 
he now believed a fresh bid would be 'rather unlikely' to succeed.
O'Leary reportedly said he would rethink the takeover after the commission rules on the issue in June, but the no-
frills airline insisted it remained committed to its plans.
O'Sullivan said he 'would not disagree' with O'Leary, saying the commission's intervention had shown there were 
'significant competition issues'.
'Our position has been well articulated -- we feel we can significantly grow shareholder value going forward as an 
independent airline,' O'Sullivan told AFX News in a telephone interview this morning.
Aer Lingus, which last year completed an IPO to raise 400 mln eur to fund growth, said pretax profits in the year to 
Dec 31 also fell by 1.3 pct to 90.4 mln eur on an 11.3 pct rise in revenues to just over 1.1 bln eur. Operating costs 
rose 12.9 pct to 1.04 bln eur. Underlying profit after tax dipped 5 pct to 77.4 mln eur.
O'Sullivan said the operating profit of 76 mln eur was better than Aer Lingus had predicted at the time of its IPO. 
The airline has a high return on capital, has cut non-fuel costs by 3.2 pct and expects operating profit in 2007/8 in 
line with market expectations at the time of the IPO, he said.
INTERVIEW Aer Lingus on track to resist Ryanair takeover, FY profits dip 6.6 pct
At the end of February, the airline had hedged about 55 pct of its fuel requirements for the 10 months to the end of 
December 2007 at an average price of 63 usd for a barrel of crude.
Aer Lingus expects the average price per barrel to rise to 64 usd in 2007 against 53 usd in 2006, resulting in an 
expected rise in the airline's total fuel cost this year of about 335 mln usd against 251 mln usd last year, O'Sullivan 
said.
The airline has clawed back some of the 15 mln eur impact that it had estimated it would receive from the UK terror 
alert, although O'Sullivan said he was unable to say exactly how much it had cost.
O'Sullivan said there was 'considerable momentum' behind the group's plans to save 20 mln eur in 2008 from its 
Programme for Continuous Improvement, which sparked a threat of industrial action from unions fearing plans to 
introduce new terms and conditions of employment for existing staff.
Following talks between the firm and the unions in the Irish Labour Court, the court has recognised the need for 
cost savings and has proposed further negotiations on the detail of some of the airline's plans.
O'Sullivan said the short timescale set for the talks would be challenging, but welcomed the court's 
recommendation that the pay, terms and conditions of
employment and work practices at Aer Lingus' overseas bases should be based on local market conditions.
The airline supports the proposed open skies agreement between the EU and US, saying it would allow it to fly to 
three destinations in the US in addition to the four it currently serves. It is targeting San Francisco, Orlando and 
Washington Dulles in addition to its existing destinations of New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Aer Lingus plans to buy about 14 long-haul aircraft to support its growth plans and is considering the Boeing 787, 
Airbus A330 and Airbus A380.
O'Sullivan declined to give further details, but said the company expects to place an order in the second quarter of 
this year.
It supports the proposed construction of a new terminal two at Dublin airport, which has faced criticism from Ryanair 
over costs, but says it wants a level playing field for charges imposed on airlines.

LONDON (AFX) - Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus PLC is tipped to see its full-year operating profit fall by some 8 pct to 
around the 66 mln eur when the airline unveils its 2006 results tomorrow.
Aer Lingus's 2005 operating profit came in at 72.4 mln eur but last year's figure is expected to have been dented by 
the bomb scares at the UK's airports last August.
Furthermore, analysts see the carrier's pretax profit falling by around 40 mln eur because of various restructuring 
costs and balancing the airline's pension fund deficit, which is likely to have cost around 120 mln eur.
The airline this morning reported a year-on-year rise in total passengers in Feb but said its load factor fell.
The total number of passengers carried last month rose 7.3 pct to 616,000 and was up 4.8 pct at 1.2 mln in the year 
to date.
The number of short-haul passengers rose 8.9 pct to 548,000 while long-haul fell 4.2 pct to 68,000.
Budget airline Ryanair PLC bid 2.80 eur per share last year for Aer Lingus, a 27 pct premium to the share price at 
the time of 2.20 eur, valuing the airline at 1.48 bln eur. The bid was subsequently withdrawn by Ryanair.
However, Ryanair later denied reports its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, had considered increasing the offer to 
3.10 eur a share.
The European Commission launched an inquiry in December into the initial offer, citing 'serious competition 
concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines.
The commission's decision has been postponed from May 11 until June 13 because it needs more time to consider 
the evidence, according to a Ryanair spokesperson.

FRANKFURT (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings Plc's proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus Group Plc is 'rather unlikely' to 
succeed, chief executive Michael O'Leary said in an interview with Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
Ryanair withdrew its 1.48 bln eur hostile takeover bid in December last year after the European Commission 
launched an in-depth inquiry citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest 
airlines.
The Commission last month extended the deadline for its inquiry to June 13.
'We'll wait and see what conditions the Commission demands and then rethink this,' O'Leary said.
'But we don't think that anything will happen before the elections in Ireland,' he said.
O'Leary's remarks appear to contrast with comments by Ryanair deputy chief executive Howard Millar last month in 
which he said there is 'a very good possibility' of a fresh bid for the Irish flag-carrier either immediately or in the next 
year if it gets the green light from the EU.
O'Leary also said Ryanair is in talks with six airports in Germany to expand its flight network in the country and will 
likely start flying from southern Germany within the next two years.
Two of the six German airports are in the southern part of the country, from where Ryanair could offer domestic 
flights to Berlin and Bremen, O'Leary said.
He also said the company's request to receive access to Munich airport's Terminal 2, which is used only by 
Deutsche Lufthansa AG and its partner airlines, was denied in writing.
The airport replied with 'two words: Go away,' O'Leary told the newspaper.
'But eventually they are going to realize that real growth lies with the budget airlines, and they will let us in.'

LONDON (AFX) - Low-cost airline Ryanair PLC has said it will block Lastminute.com and other tour operator 
websites from selling its flights at inflated prices.
In a statement the airline said: 'Ryanair has written to the Trading Standards Institute to complain about these 
practices at Lastminute.com and will continue to take steps to block bookings made by online travel agents. It is 
time to stop people being misled by rip-off middlemen like Lastminute.com'.
The airline said it had taken steps to block certain tour operator websites because they: charge extortionate mark 
ups - adding up to 133 pct to the price, provide incorrect and misleading terms and conditions, mislead passengers 
on baggage allowances and dimensions, fail to advise passengers of schedule change information, deny 
passengers the opportunity to pre-book bags online and do not provide web check in and priority boarding options.
Ryanair said that Lastminute.com, Ebookers, Flights Direct and Global Holidays are all guilty of misleading 
prospective Ryanair passengers in one way or another.
However, in a statement Lastminute.com, which is now owned by the US travel giant Sabre, insisted its customers 
were getting a competitive deal on Ryanair flights.
John Bevan, travel director at Lastminute.com told the Belfast Telegraph that 'all our (Lastminute.com's) flight fares 
are inclusive of all taxes, unlike Ryanair who add them at the end of the booking process.'

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings said it plans to take action to prevent rivals such as online tour 
operators from reselling its flights.
The Dublin-based carrier claimed some companies routinely double the price of its services while failing to advise 
passengers of the airline's terms and conditions, flight schedule changes and other information.
A spokeswoman for Ryanair said potential measures that the airline may take include blocking credit cards used by 
companies to bulk-buy flights.

Spirit charges for baggage, cuts fares

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - Spirit Airlines said Tuesday it will take the unusual step of charging for all 
checked baggage and for drinks such as coffee and soda on flights starting in June, while also cutting fares by up to 
40 percent.
The Miramar-based low-cost carrier that flies domestically and to Latin America and the Caribbean said it is cutting 
fares from 10 to 40 percent systemwide, and on last-minute fares as well.
Spirit also will charge for each checked bag for flights taking place June 20 or after, according to its Web site. 
Customers will still be allowed one carry-on bag for free, but one or two checked bags will cost $5 each if 
passengers make flight reservations on the carrier's Web site. The fee will be $10 each for one or two bags if 
passengers don't use the Web site for reservations. The charge is $100 for the third bag and on.
The airline currently allows one checked bag for free and $10 for a second checked bag.
Also starting June 20, soft drinks, juices, coffee and tea -- which are now free -- will cost $1. Water will still be free.
Most large U.S. carriers allow a carry-on bag and up to two or three checked bags at no additional charge per 
passenger. However, U.K.-based Ryanair charges a fee for each item of checked baggage, according to its Web 
site. Air Canada offers customers the option of saving $5 if they don't check any baggage.
With drinks, carriers usually charge for alcoholic beverages on domestic flights. But sodas, coffee and juice are 
usually free.
Bob Harrell, a travel consultant in New York, said airlines that cater to leisure travel such as Spirit often adjust fares, 
raising or lowering them 25 percent or more from one week to another in some cases. But airlines also are seeking 
ways to offset baggage handling costs, and lowering prices may be a way for Spirit to justify the move to charge for 
checked bags, Harrell said
'The baggage and the soda changes are new,' said Harrell, of Harrell Associates. 'If they're not exclusively new, 
then it's certainly unusual.'
However, Harrell added that while it's possible that the major airlines would be looking at the success or failure of 
Spirit's changes, 'You wouldn't see a lemming type of match from the larger carriers.'
Spirit charges for baggage, cuts fares
The move also reflects a strategy where services for baggage handling and beverages are 'a la carte,' or pay-as-
you-go, said Robert Mann, an airline industry analyst with R.W. Mann & Co. Inc. in Port Washington, N.Y.
At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Naomi Berger waited for a return flight to New York's Laguardia 
Airport. She said the airline told her of the $10 charge for a second checked bag by e-mail, and that she was OK 
with the extra charge because she paid $85 for her round trip ticket from New York to visit a relative in Miami Beach 
with her daughter and husband.
'If they keep the fares down, people use them,' said Berger, who lives on Long Island.
But her husband, Robert Berger, was more critical of the charges. He said airlines are more interested in just 
getting travelers to their destinations and making short-term profits, rather than building a customer base by 
providing good service.
'Only an airline with no pride would charge you for a cup of soda,' said Robert Berger, who is in the 
telecommunications business. 'We'll pay them for the $10 for baggage and $1 for soda because we're still ahead of 
the game' on ticket prices, he said.
Spirit also plans to eliminate first-class service and free alcoholic drinks. The former first-class seats will be called 
'Big Front Seats' and sell at premium prices.
The airline is offering 1 cent fares, plus fees and taxes, to and from select cities in March, April and May. Customers 
have until Wednesday to book those flights.
Spirit, which is privately owned, offers service to 33 cities in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Spirit has hubs in Detroit and Fort Lauderdale. Its competitors include JetBlue, Northwest Airlines and Southwest 
Airlines.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Easyjet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC have been upgraded to 'overweight' from 
'neutral' by HSBC, dealers said.
The broker told clients that it believes the two groups' share prices do not reflect the benefit of lower fuel prices and 
more stable average fares.
HSBC added that substantial operating leverage leads to significant earnings upgrades and it has raised its target 
prices to 800 pence from 605 and to 7.20 eur from 5.30 respectively.

LONDON (AFX) - Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC is to enter talks with a trade union to try to avert a 
threatened 24-hour strike over reported plans to cut staff benefits and overtime.
Aer Lingus said it had agreed to attend exploratory talks with the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical 
Union (SIPTU) in the Irish Labour Court today in an attempt to prevent the walkout planned for Monday March 5.
SIPTU has threatened the action to try to halt the airline's planned introduction on March 1 of new terms and 
conditions of employment for existing staff as part of the company's Programme for Continuous Improvement 2007.
The union said the action will be followed by an ongoing overtime ban and work-to-rule and that further stoppages 
will be notified to the public.
Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion said the airline must aggressively prune staff costs to become more 
competitive, notably with Dublin-based budget rival Ryanair, according to a report in the International Herald 
Tribune.
He rejected union accusations that the new work rules were unreasonable or were being imposed too quickly, the 
report said.

Ryanair denies reported plan for 15 pct hike in Aer Lingus bid

LONDON (AFX) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has dismissed a claim that it is preparing to raise its bid for 
fellow Irish carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC by 15 pct.
The company said there was 'no truth' in a report in The Business magazine citing a source at the company as 
saying chief executive Michael O'Leary is considering increasing Ryanair's offer to a possible 3.10 eur a share. 
O'Leary hopes this will be enough to get the 50.1 pct stake needed to take control of the Irish flag carrier, the report 
said.
Ryanair bid 2.80 eur per share last year for Aer Lingus, a 27 pct premium to the share price at the time of 2.20 eur, 
valuing the airline at 1.48 bln eur.
The European Commission launched an inquiry in December into the now-aborted initial offer, citing 'serious 
competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two biggest airlines.
Its decision has been postponed from May 11 until June 13 because it needs more time to consider the evidence, 
Ryanair said today.
The company said in a statement it is confident that the transaction will be cleared by the European Commission as 
it is a 'pro-competitive and pro-consumer deal, which will bring lower fares, greater efficiency, new aircraft and more 
choice for consumers around Europe'.
It recently said if the ruling goes in its favour, there is a 'very good possibility' it will bid again either immediately or in 
the next year.
Ryanair built up a 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus before launching its bid, which is opposed by the Irish government, 
Aer Lingus's employees trust and Irish businessman Denis O'Brien, who together hold 40.1 pct.

The commission launches first-phase inquiries into all deals that meet EU merger thresholds. These 
inquiries last one month, but are extended by two weeks when companies offer remedies or when a national 
competition authority asks to rule on the deal. A deal that is not expected to raise competition concerns 
may be submitted as a candidate for the EU's simplified merger procedure, a reduced regulatory process. 
The commission is entitled to transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.
IN-DEPTH SECOND PHASE INVESTIGATIONS
April 17 -Proposed space ops merger agreement between Thales, Finmeccanica SpA, Alcatel and Telespazio 
April 23 -Proposed acquisition by Johnson Controls INC's VB Autobatterie GmbH of FIAMM group's automotive 
starter battery business
EU merger reviews at a glance outlook
May 15 -Proposed acquisition of SIG Holding AG by CVC Capital Partners and Ferd Industrial Holding's 
Elopak unit 
June 1 -Proposed acquisition by Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group of BMG Music Publishing
June 13 -Proposed acquisition by Ryanair Holdings of Aer Lingus Group PLC
The commission opens in-depth probes, lasting up to four months, if competition concerns cannot be resolved 
during the first-phase inquiry.

MADRID (AFX) - Shares in Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA are expected to open lower after Deutsche Bank 
cut its rating to 'sell' on valuation concerns saying the Spanish flagship has outperformed the EU airline sector by 
20 pct, dealers said.
In a note to investors, Deutsche Bank analysts said that its sees limited visibility for the airline after its shares sold 
at all time highs and at a nearly 13 pct premium to the sector average.
Increased competition from low cost carriers at its home base Madrid is adding to the concerns, where competitors 
Ryanair, Easyjet and Vueling have opened operational bases in the last four months, analysts said.
Recent reports showing little progress in the negotiations with its pilots union after three years is also reason for the 
downgrade, they noted.
Deutsche Bank analysts added they see stock overhang risk as the core shareholder base, including Banco Bilbao 
Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Logista, El Corte Ingles, SEPI and Caja Monte, may be eager to exit, 'now that their 
investment is - after seven years - at last breaking even'.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC could face an Irish government investigation following dangerous landing 
approaches allegedly made by the no-frills airline, the Guardian reported.
Irish transport minister Martin Cullen has asked the republic's Department of Transport to compile a briefing into 
four incidents in the last two years, in which Ryanair pilots reportedly failed to follow standard landing procedures, 
the newspaper said.
The report could lead to a formal investigation by the Irish Aviation Authority, although Irish ministers will have to 
'wait and see' what it says, the Guardian quoted Cullen as saying.
Last month, Irish air accident investigators reported a 'serious incident' in which a Ryanair aircraft, trying to land at 
Cork in June last year, failed to perform a standard procedure known as a 'go-around' after aborting a landing, the 
newspaper said.
Instead, the jet banked in a tight circle to try again minutes later, bringing the jet within 425 feet of the ground.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary told the Guardian that the airline would demote or dismiss any pilot who 
does not perform a 'go-around' if a landing descent goes wrong.
'What we had in these cases was jet jockeys deciding 'I am better than Ryanair SOPs' (standard operating 
procedures). We don't want anyone doing that,' the newspaper reported O'Leary as saying.
Ryanair said it has reminded its pilots about the need for go-arounds if an aircraft is not approaching an airport at 
the correct height and speed. It has pointed out that the air accident report about the Cork incident did not criticise 
or find fault with the airline.
A Ryanair spokesman said, 'all of these incidents have been reported on (by the Irish air accident investigation unit) 
and dealt with and Ryanair has said it will comply with the findings of the reports.'

Ryanair and EasyJet.
The broker added that Air Berlin's attractive purchase deals with Airbus and Boeing should continue to underpin its

LONDON (AFX) - Satellite services firm Inmarsat Holdings Ltd is set to report another year of growth when it 
unveils its results for 2006 at the end of the month, Michael Butler, president and COO of the company told AFX 
News today in an interview.
Speaking at an event to mark the signing of an agreement which will see Thales UK become a distribution partner 
for Inmarsat's Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) mobile satellite broadband service, Butler said the company 
had performed well over the company's last fiscal year.
'The past year has been a very good year for us. BGAN is probably on momentum now and we have seen gains 
across all of our divisions. Maritime is up, the aeronautical business has been going great and with BGAN making a 
difference now the year ahead also looks good,' said Butler. 'When we had our IPO in 2005 we committed to an 
accelerated growth trajectory and that is what we are doing and I think 2007 is undoubtedly set to be another year 
of growth.'
As well as continuing to push BGAN, Inmarsat is set to launch Swift Broadband, which will offer travellers 
broadband connections and allow them to use their mobile phones on planes, by the year-end. Through its partner 
OnAir, Inmarsat has agreed to roll the service out on Ryanair flights by the end of 2007.
'People often used to associate our business with disasters such as mudslides or wars, for example. But within a 
relatively stable world last year we have been able to show a very good performance, which means that people are 
using our services as an integral part of their business operations and not as communications of last resort,' 
explained Butler. 'When we all get on to a Ryanair aircraft in the third quarter of the year and make mobile phone 
calls, that will show that we are starting to bring our underlying capability to the masses.'
After a period of consolidation in the satellite services industry in recent years Butler believes the number of 'viable' 
players in the sector will have to shrink in the future. He has though, for now, ruled Inmarsat out of any significant 
acquisition activity.
'In terms of acquisitions there is nothing on the horizon right now that is going to alter our emphasis on the growth 
rate for this year,' said Butler. 'But we never say never and if there was a smaller bolt-on that we thought would be 
good for us we would consider it.'
INTERVIEW Inmarsat president predicts continued growth for the group in 2007
Inmarsat's two satellites (Inmarsat-4) currently cover 176 countries and a third satellite is set to be launched early in 
2008. However, Butler is keen to see Inmarsat take advantage of opportunities coming up in the developing 
markets and beyond.
'There is a huge domestic opportunity coming up in China which we are gearing up for and we have made an 
agreement with our first ever primary distribution partner in Africa and have plans to cover all sub-Saharan Africa.' 
he said. 'Latin America offers good opportunities but has its own challenges such as high import taxes, but there is 
a lot of growth to be had in the US as well.'

Tiger Airways to bring Ryanair model to Australia - report
Tiger Airways to bring Ryanair model to Australia - report

SYDNEY (XFN-ASIA) - Cut-price carrier Tiger Airways is likely to bring the Ryanair model of flying into cheaper, 
regional airports to Australia when it gets the go-ahead to operate here, chief executive Tony Davis said Sunday.
Tiger Airlines, which is backed by Singapore Airlines and Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, last week announced it had 
applied for government clearance to begin operating in the domestic market before the end of the year.
Davis was coy on the routes Tiger will operate in Australia, saying he did not want to tip off the competition -- 
Qantas and its budget arm Jetstar as well as Virgin Blue -- but said it would amount to a 'comprehensive network'.
'At this stage we're not revealing the route network that we're going to propose,' he told ABC Television.
'We're going to keep that close to our chest for the time being but, as the regulatory process goes on, we'll be able 
to reveal more in the coming months.'
Davis said the new airline would look at flying into small centres rather than just major cities, similar to the 
operations of Ryanair in Europe and Tiger services in Asia.
'Well, certainly the success of people like Ryanair in Europe has been that they could go into secondary airports, to 
go to regional airports and really create new markets and create new opportunities,' he said.
'So, what we're looking at in Australia is that -- we'll certainly look at the major cities but we're also keen to bring the 
advantages of low cost airfares into the regional communities.'
He said Australia, where domestic flights can be lengthy and expensive, did not have particularly low fares and 
Tiger would use the stripped-back approach of Ryanair to keep costs down.
'It's about having a single aircraft type, it's about operating to regional airports and getting lower fees to use those 
airports, and it's about giving consumers choice to purchase additional services if they require them,' Davis said.
'But at its core is a very efficient and very focused business model which allows very low unit costs, and those low 
unit costs mean sustained and consistent low fares.'
Davis said the airline will have an initial investment of up to 10 mln aud as well as five new Airbus A320s available 
by the end of the year, with the option of more aircraft if warranted by demand.

'We're determined to make Tiger Airways a national carrier and we'll be entering a lot of markets around the 
country,' he said.
Davis said Tiger would compete aggressively against Qantas.
'We've been competing very aggressively in Singapore against JetStar Asia, which Qantas brought into the 
Singapore market, and it's probably only right and proper that we reciprocate the favour by competing aggressively 
and effectively here in Australia,' he said.
Tiger, which began flying in 2004, is owned by four shareholders including Singapore Airlines which has a 49 pct 
stake, and state-linked Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings with 11 pct. Irishman Tony Ryan has a 16 pct 
stake.

SYDNEY (XFN-ASIA) - Cut-price carrier Tiger Airways is likely to bring the Ryanair model of flying into cheaper, 
regional airports to Australia when it gets the go-ahead to operate here, chief executive Tony Davis said Sunday.
Tiger Airlines, which is backed by Singapore Airlines and Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, last week announced it had 
applied for government clearance to begin operating in the domestic market before the end of the year.
Davis was coy on the routes Tiger will operate in Australia, saying he did not want to tip off the competition -- 
Qantas and its budget arm Jetstar as well as Virgin Blue -- but said it would amount to a 'comprehensive network'.
'At this stage we're not revealing the route network that we're going to propose,' he told ABC Television.
'We're going to keep that close to our chest for the time being but, as the regulatory process goes on, we'll be able 
to reveal more in the coming months.'
Davis said the new airline would look at flying into small centres rather than just major cities, similar to the 
operations of Ryanair in Europe and Tiger services in Asia.
'Well, certainly the success of people like Ryanair in Europe has been that they could go into secondary airports, to 
go to regional airports and really create new markets and create new opportunities,' he said.
'So, what we're looking at in Australia is that -- we'll certainly look at the major cities but we're also keen to bring the 
advantages of low cost airfares into the regional communities.'
He said Australia, where domestic flights can be lengthy and expensive, did not have particularly low fares and 
Tiger would use the stripped-back approach of Ryanair to keep costs down.
'It's about having a single aircraft type, it's about operating to regional airports and getting lower fees to use those

UK Treasury hits back at Ryanair air tax 'skyway robbery' claims
UK Treasury hits back at Ryanair air tax 'skyway robbery' claims

LONDON (AFX) - The British Treasury has hit back at claims by low-cost airline Ryanair PLC that the government 
will not spend the funds its makes from doubling the air passenger duty (APD) on the environment.
A statement issued today by Ryanair branded as 'rubbish' claims by UK Chancellor Gordon Brown that the 1 bln stg 
the additional tax will bring in to the Treasury annually would be used to help the environment.
However, the Treasury has hit back by saying that the increase in APD will save the equivalent of three quarters of 
a million tonnes of carbon every year by 2011. The Treasury also insists that the cash generated by the APD will be 
used wisely and will not 'disappear into his [Gordon Brown's] pockets' as Ryanair has claimed.
'The Chancellor has said that the revenues raised from the increase will secure extra resources in the coming 
spending round for our priorities such as public transport and the environment,' a Treasury spokesperson said in a 
statement.
'The Treasury continues to believe that the inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme is the most 
efficient and cost-effective way to aid this sector in meeting its external costs and playing its part in tackling climate 
change.'
Ryanair, who has called on its customers to write to Gordon Brown to voice their concerns about the tax says the 
implementation of the tax -- which came into force on Feb 1 -- is a form of 'skyway robbery'.
'Gordon Brown is guilty of using the environment to steal more taxes from ordinary people and in just one week he 
has already grabbed 20 mln stg. Over the coming year he will use this tax hike as an excuse to steal 1 bln stg of 
passengers' money,' said Ryanair's head of communications, Peter Sherrard.
The Dublin-based carrier says that Brown should tackle the main sources of pollution in the UK -- namely power 
generation and road transport, which it claims account for 26 pct and 18 pct of CO2 emissions.
The Treasury, however, says it is airlines and travel companies -- not passengers -- who are liable for APD.
'It is a commercial matter for those companies whether or not, and how, they choose to pass this on to passengers,' 
a Treasury spokesperson said.
UK Treasury hits back at Ryanair air tax 'skyway robbery' claims
Under measures announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-Budget report in early December, short-haul passengers 
in the lowest class of travel will pay 10 stg in duty from Feb 1, up from 5 stg, and in other classes they will pay 20 
stg, up from 10 stg.
Long-haul passengers in the lowest class of travel will pay 40 stg, up from 20 stg, and in others they will pay 80 stg, 
up from 40 stg.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair have been upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' by Citigroup as the broker raised its 
forecasts in view of the group's improved revenue, dealers said.
In a research report this morning, Citigroup lifted its target price to 14.4 eur from 12.2 eur, while raising its current 
and next EPS to 0.51 eur and 0.69 eur, respectively, and hiking its fourth-quarter income to 17 mln eur from 7 mln 
eur.
The broker noted this was largely based on the group's third-quarter jump in average ticket prices, up 7 pct against 
the group's 2-3 pct guidance and the broker's 5 pct assumption.
Citigroup said it expects a 13 pct fall in fuel costs in 2008 and noted the possibility of cash returns to shareholders 
seems to have increased.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC is threatening to sack pilots after being criticised by air accident 
investigators over a series of dangerous approaches to airports, according to a report in the UK's The Times 
newspaper.
The paper says that in the latest incident to emerge, an aircraft flew so low over rooftops that it triggered two 
warnings in the cockpit and sixteen complaints from alarmed residents.
It was the third serious incident in less than a year, and the fourth in two years, involving a Ryanair jet approaching 
an airport too fast or at the wrong height and being forced to abort landing, said the Times report.
All Ryanair staff are under pressure to meet turnaround times of only 25 minutes, the tightest in the industry, and 
pilot unions say that this can lead to mistakes.
The Times claims that Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, has responded to the incidents by issuing a 
memo to all pilots telling them that they will be demoted the first time they make a dangerous approach and sacked 
for a second offence.
The memo, a copy of which has been obtained by The Times, states that a new disciplinary procedure is being 
introduced in response to a series of 'high energy approach incidents over the past two years'.
Pilot unions said that the memo would force the problem underground, leaving pilots too frightened of losing their 
jobs to cooperate with efforts to find out why the incidents were happening.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in easyJet were lower in early deals as profit takers emerged after the discount airline 
said it expects to see its pretax profit for the full year increase by 40-50 pct, dealers said.
At 8.45 am, shares in EasyJet were 11-1/2 pence lower at 678.
Earlier, in a first-quarter trading update out today, EasyJet said its total revenue in the three months to Dec was up 
14.9 pct year-on-year to 366.2 mln stg.
The carrier said its total revenue per seat for the quarter was up 4 pct to 36.8 stg.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, the airline said it expects a slight on-year increase in passenger revenue per 
seat, with ancillary revenues continuing to grow ahead of capacity.
Reacting to the numbers, Collins Stewart said easyJet has a solid fan club and todays upgrade and the strong 
earnings momentum should keep holders happy.
However, it believes easyJets valuation is now looking very stretched. And on a simple PE basis it is trading on 19 
times 2007 earnings, compared to Ryanair on 18.3 times earnings.
It noted easyJets revenue return on fleet is a modest 12.5 pct compared to Ryanairs 17 pct.
Collins Stewart said if the shares rise too much further, it would encourage investors to sell the stock. The broker 
maintained its 'hold' rating and 600 pence target.
In other comment, Daniel Stewart raised its forecast pretax profit for easyJet by 10 pct to 190 mln stg for 2007, and 
238 mln stg for 2008.
It maintained a 'buy' rating on a revised price target of 825 pence.

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it was axing two routes as it announced plans to invest 
140 mln eur in a new base at a regional airport near Dusseldorf in Germany from June this year.
Ryanair said it plans to withdraw flights between Girona and Marrakesh and between Stansted and Deauville in 
northern France.
The airline said the move will free up capacity needed for 16 new routes announced today, including one from the 
new base planned at Dusseldorf Weeze airport, a former military airbase about an hour away from the city centre.
Ryanair said it will buy two new aircraft and run 10 routes from Dusseldorf Weeze, enabling it to deliver 1 mln 
passengers in the new hub's first full year and treble existing traffic from the airport to 2 mln passengers per year 
from 2008.
'These 2 million passengers will create 2,000 local jobs and enable passengers to fly for a fraction of the high fares 
charged at Dusseldorf International airport,' Ryanair said in a statement.
Destinations from the new hub will include Alghero in Sardinia, Alicante, Barcelona, Glasgow, London, Palma in 
Majorca, Rome, Shannon in the Irish Republic, Stockholm and Venice.
The low-cost carrier also announced a total of 16 new routes today, bringing its route network to 454.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest low fares airline, today announced record third quarter 
figures with profits after tax for the three months to Dec 2006 up by 30 pct to 47.7 mln eur, compared to 36.8 mln 
eur for the same quarter a year ago.
Basic earnings per share for the period rose by 29 pct to 6.18 cents, compared to 4.79 cents last time, while 
revenues for the period climbed 33 pct to 492.8 mln eur.
Passenger traffic for the the third quarter was up 19 pct to 10.3 mln while yields were up 7 pct. The group said it 
saw passenger traffic for the final three months of 2006-07 rising by 25 pct.
The airline also raised its profits guidance for the full year, despite the threat of rising fuel costs.
It now sees full year profits after tax for the year to end-March rising by around 29 pct to 390 mln eur, compared to 
its earlier forecast of 350 mln eur.
Fuel costs for the third quarter to end-Dec 2006 increased by 52 pct to 175 mln eur and the group said fuel costs 
are likely to remain high for the remainder of 2006-07.
However, Ryanair maintained its net margin of 10 pct in the third quarter, which was significantly ahead of 
expectations.

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is widely expected to report a moderate increase in Q3 
pretax profits due to rising passenger numbers and a lower, more stable oil price over recent months, when it 
reports today.
Investment bank UBS expects to see Ryanair's Q3 yield rise by around 3 pct and sees the risk to the airline's 
numbers 'on the upside' for FY07. UBS forecasts 383 mln eur for the year - 33 mln eur, or 9 pct, above Ryanair's 
own guidance.
However, in a note, UBS transport analyst Tim Marshall said 'consensus earnings do not reflect the market's 
expectations and if there is not an upgrade to company guidance then there could be some disappointment in the 
share price.' Marshall added that the airline should 'benefit a little from British Airways' woes and easyJet had a 
good quarter for revenue in Q4. We expect to see earnings rise.'
Ryanair has said, however, that it remains slightly cautious about its second half due to substantial capacity 
expansion. The airline plans to launch seven more new routes this year, including two services in May from Dublin 
to Bydgoszcz and Gdansk in Poland. The Dublin-based carrier said it would also increase frequencies on its routes 
from the Irish capital to Bratislava, Biarritz, Carcassonne, Kaunas, Krakow, Malaga, Murcia, Riga and Rome.
Furthermore, the airline plans to double its traffic to and from Italy in the next five years, from the 12 mln 
passengers seen in the year to March. Ryanair carried 19 pct more passengers last month than in December a year 
ago.
The Dublin-based carrier said 3,361,169 people travelled on its flights during the month, compared with 2,833,765 
passengers in December 2005.
Ryanair has also voiced concerns about the controversial and recently implemented hikes in air passenger duty 
(APD) imposed by the UK government. Under measures announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown in his pre-Budget 
report in early December, short-haul passengers in the lowest class of travel will pay 10 stg in duty from Feb 1, up 
from 5 stg, and in other classes they will pay 20 stg, up from 10 stg.
Ryanair is asking passengers to pay the extra duty if they bought tickets before the announcement. Although this 
hike is unlikely to dent Q3 earnings it could well have an adverse impact on the groups second half.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair rallied in midmorning trade as the market welcomed news the group has 
increased its 2007 full-year guidance as it unveiled a set of 'strong' third-quarter revenues, dealers said.
At 10.38 am, shares in Ryanair took on 0.68 eur at 11.9, a rally of more than 6 pct.
This morning, Europe's biggest low-fares airline unveiled record third-quarter figures with profits after tax for the 
three months to Dec 2006 up by 30 pct to 47.7 mln eur, compared to 36.8 mln eur for the same quarter a year ago.
Revenues for the period climbed 33 pct to 492.8 mln eur, with passenger traffic for the third-quarter up 19 pct to 
10.3 mln while yields were up 7 pct.
The airline also raised its profits guidance for the full year, despite the threat of rising fuel costs.
Reacting to the figures, UBS kept its 'buy' stance, noting the Q3 net profit of around 48 mln eur beat its 35 mln eur 
expectations, while revenue of around 493 mln eur exceeded its 460 mln eur estimate.
The broker highlighted the group's current year guidance upgrade and the increase in fuel hedging going into 2008.
On the oil-hedging, Collins Stewart reiterated its 'buy' stance while noting that there could be a further boost to the 
group's 2008 forecasts if the fuel price remains below 60 usd.
However, Deutsche Bank reiterated a cautious stance on the stock, remaining on 'sell', and noting that while the 
third-quarter revenues were 7 pct ahead of its forecasts, costs excluding fuel continue to rise, up 3 pct in the last 
quarter.

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said it may make another takeover play for Aer Lingus 
Group PLC as it posted a 30 pct rise in third-quarter net profit to 48 mln eur.
Ryanair's deputy chief executive Howard Millar said there is 'a very good possibility' of a fresh bid for the Irish flag-
carrier either immediately or in the next year if it gets the green light from the European Union.
The European Commission in December launched an inquiry into the budget airline's now-aborted 1.48 bln eur 
hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus, citing 'serious competition concerns' over the proposed merger of Ireland's two 
biggest airlines.
A decision is due in May and some lawyers have suggested that if the commission decides that a combination of 
the two airlines would hamper competition, it may also order Ryanair to sell its 25.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair said in its third-quarter results statement today that it remained confident its offer would obtain approval 
following the commission's phase 2 review.
If the commission decides in its favour, the airline could make another bid for Aer Lingus or decide that it is not 
appropriate and bid later on, Millar said.
He said it would have to wait and see, but added: 'If we get EU competition approval, there's a very good possibility 
that we will make another bid either immediately or in the next year.'
Ryanair today announced record third-quarter figures with profits after tax for the three months to Dec 2006 up by 
30 pct to 47.7 mln eur, compared to 36.8 mln eur for the same quarter a year ago.
The Dublin-based carrier said traffic grew 19 pct to 10.3 mln and it maintained a net margin of 10 pct in the quarter 
despite much higher oil costs.
Millar defended the airline's recent decision to pass on to its customers the doubling of UK air passenger duty 
(APD) announced by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown in December.
He described the tax as 'unfair and unwarranted' and said the UK government should have imposed extra tax on 
energy bills or petrol rather than aviation, which he said accounts for less than 1.6 pct of greenhouse gas 
emissions.
INTERVIEW Ryanair says 'very good possibility' of fresh bid for Aer Lingus
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary last month retracted a claim that the airline had cut emissions of carbon 
dioxide by half over the past five years.
O'Leary said the statement was 'an error' following an investigation by BBC Newsnight and subsequently said its 
fuel use had increased eight-fold between 1998 and 2006.
Millar said today that the airline had reduced its emissions by 50 pct on a per passenger kilometre basis over a 
three-year period, although he said the airline had carried more passengers in the period so its total emissions had 
gone up.
He said the airline was happy to consider becoming part of proposed EU emissions trading arrangements, providing 
they were fair and that airlines with newer aircraft were penalised less than those with older, less efficient fleets.
Last week, Ryanair said plans for a 1.4 bln stg new runway and terminal at Stansted were unnecessary and too 
expensive.
Millar acknowledged the need for expansion at Stansted, saying the airport was full to capacity at peak times and 
that there was a 'great opportunity' to grow the London air travel market, but added: 'We think this should be at an 
appropriate cost.'

OUTLOOK Ryanair set to report moderate Q3 growth
OUTLOOK Ryanair set to report moderate Q3 growth

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is widely expected to report a moderate increase in Q3 
pretax profits due to rising passenger numbers and a lower, more stable oil price over recent months, when it 
reports on Monday.
Investment bank UBS expects to see Ryanair's Q3 yield rise by around 3 pct and sees the risk to the airline's 
numbers 'on the upside' for FY07. UBS forecasts 383 mln eur for the year - 33 mln eur, or 9 pct, above Ryanair's 
own guidance.
However, in a note, UBS transport analyst Tim Marshall said 'consensus earnings do not reflect the market's 
expectations and if there is not an upgrade to company guidance then there could be some disappointment in the 
share price.' Marshall added that the airline should 'benefit a little from British Airways' woes and easyJet had a 
good quarter for revenue in Q4. We expect to see earnings rise.'
Ryanair has said, however, that it remains slightly cautious about its second half due to substantial capacity 
expansion. The airline plans to launch seven more new routes this year, including two services in May from Dublin 
to Bydgoszcz and Gdansk in Poland. The Dublin-based carrier said it would also increase frequencies on its routes 
from the Irish capital to Bratislava, Biarritz, Carcassonne, Kaunas, Krakow, Malaga, Murcia, Riga and Rome.
Furthermore, the airline plans to double its traffic to and from Italy in the next five years, from the 12 mln 
passengers seen in the year to March. Ryanair carried 19 pct more passengers last month than in December a year 
ago.
The Dublin-based carrier said 3,361,169 people travelled on its flights during the month, compared with 2,833,765 
passengers in December 2005.
Ryanair has also voiced concerns about the controversial and recently implemented hikes in air passenger duty 
(APD) imposed by the UK government. Under measures announced by Chancellor Gordon Brown in his pre-Budget 
report in early December, short-haul passengers in the lowest class of travel will pay 10 stg in duty from Feb 1, up 
from 5 stg, and in other classes they will pay 20 stg, up from 10 stg.
Ryanair is asking passengers to pay the extra duty if they bought tickets before the announcement. Although this 
hike is unlikely to dent Q3 earnings it could well have an adverse impact on the groups second half.

SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AFX) - Gulf Arab countries, shedding their traditional reputation for opulence, are 
the latest to join the phenomenon of no-frills budget airlines that have transformed air travel in Europe and America.
The three chief Mideast budget airlines -- Air Arabia, Jazeera Airways and Atlas Blue -- have already grabbed 5 
percent of the region's air travel market, and analysts say that portion is set to increase in coming years as booming 
Gulf economies attract more fliers.
Despite the Gulf's luxury-obsessed reputation, there is a healthy market for low-cost flights, said Habib Fekih, 
president of Airbus Middle East, a unit of the European aircraft manufacturer.
'Many people have this perception of the Gulf as being dedicated to anything first class, but this is not true,' Fekih 
said. 'A big part of the population in this part of the world need low fares. They are either Asian laborers or Western 
expatriates whose number is increasing because of the region's booming economies.'
Like Europe's easyJet and Ryanair, and America's Southwest Airlines, budget carriers in the Middle East are 
connecting mid-sized cities that may otherwise have no direct links.
Common destinations include Egypt's central city of Assiut and coastal city of Sharm el Sheik; Almaty in 
Kazakhstan; Iran's holy city Mashhad; Syria's ancient cities of Aleppo and Damascus; Yerevan, Armenia; and small 
cities in India, like Kochi and Nagpur.
Mideast budget airlines offer services similar to their U.S. counterparts, from guaranteed seats and meals for 
purchase on board to free checked luggage up to 44 pounds. Jazeera offers a 'Jazeera Plus' business-class 
equivalent. That's considerably less luxurious than carriers like Emirates, which fly global routes and are known for 
first-class service.
On shared destinations, budget airlines are far cheaper than full service airlines. Emirates airlines charges $540 for 
a round-trip from Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram, India. The same trip from Sharjah on Air Arabia costs $266. A 
round trip ticket from Kuwait City to Mumbai, India, costs $800 on Kuwait Airways and $240 on Jazeera.
Aviation experts say budget carriers' success stems from the easing of government restrictions on competition. 
Deregulation that has sparked competition in the Gulf still has a long way to go in some markets. Budget airlines 
are still banned from operating to Cairo, said Abdul Wahab Teffaha, secretary-general of the Arab Air Carriers 
Organization, a Lebanon-based industry advocacy group.

'In the Arab world, liberalization is a gradual move toward easing restrictions. We are heading in that direction, but I 
cannot say we are totally there yet,' Teffaha said.
Sharjah-based Air Arabia, the oldest and largest of the Arab world's three budget airlines, saw its passenger 
numbers increase from 500,000 in 2004 to 1.8 million passengers last year, said Adel Ali, Air Arabia's chief 
executive. The fast-growing airline has transformed Sharjah's once bucolic airport, ferrying passengers to 31 
destinations, including faraway cities in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Nepal and Sudan.
The company began operating in late 2003 with two aircraft and a $13 million grant from the government of 
Sharjah, a conservative emirate overshadowed by its freewheeling neighbor, Dubai.
Air Arabia now owns nine aircraft and plans to go public, selling 55 percent of its shares this year, Ali said. The 
Sharjah government will retain 45 percent ownership.
The airline expects to report 2006 profits significantly higher than the $8.8 million it made in 2005, Ali said.
Air Arabia is not the only budget player plying busy routes in the Middle East.
Kuwait-based Jazeera Airways, the only private airline in the Middle East, grew from two planes and five 
destinations in October 2005 to four aircraft flying to 12 destinations last year, said Marwan Boodai, Jazeera's chief 
executive. Jazeera carried about 500,000 passengers last year, he said.
A third budget carrier, Marrakech, Morocco-based Atlas Blue, established in 2004, caters to European tourists 
linking 15 European cities with Marrakech.
Low-cost carriers from outside are also breaking into the market. In 2005, Air India launched Air India Express, a 
no-frills operation connecting India to the Mideast. Air India Express started with 14 flights a week from India to Abu 
Dhabi, the Emirates' capital, and has since expanded to 50 a week, said Dubai-based regional director F.J. Vaz. In 
addition to the Emirates, the Indian carrier connects Bahrain and two cities in Oman to several cities in India.
Saudi Arabia is in the process of granting traffic rights to two budget airlines, Sama and National Air Services.
Despite the flurry of activity, JP Morgan's Peter Negline said the Mideast budget air travel market is still in its 
infancy.
'They're in a position to stimulate a lot of traffic,' said Negline, a Hong Kong-based airline analyst.
Budget airlines are hampered by their reliance on Internet sales and credit cards, said Danvir Khawaja, managing 
director of Arabian Travels agency in Dubai.
'Budget airlines still make their best offers online but most people in this part of the world still prefer to deal with 
another human being,' he said. 'People are also less comfortable using their credit cards.' But he expects people in 
time will become more comfortable dealing with budget airlines.

SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AFX) - Gulf Arab countries, shedding their traditional reputation for opulence, are 
the latest to join the phenomenon of no-frills budget airlines that have transformed air travel in Europe and America.
The three chief Mideast budget airlines -- Air Arabia, Jazeera Airways and Atlas Blue -- have already grabbed 5 
percent of the region's air travel market, and analysts say that portion is set to increase in coming years as booming 
Gulf economies attract more fliers.
Despite the Gulf's luxury-obsessed reputation, there is a healthy market for low-cost flights, said Habib Fekih, 
president of Airbus Middle East, a unit of the European aircraft manufacturer.
'Many people have this perception of the Gulf as being dedicated to anything first class, but this is not true,' Fekih 
said. 'A big part of the population in this part of the world need low fares. They are either Asian laborers or Western 
expatriates whose number is increasing because of the region's booming economies.'
Like Europe's easyJet and Ryanair, and America's Southwest Airlines, budget carriers in the Middle East are 
connecting mid-sized cities that may otherwise have no direct links.
Common destinations include Egypt's central city of Assiut and coastal city of Sharm el Sheik; Almaty in 
Kazakhstan; Iran's holy city Mashhad; Syria's ancient cities of Aleppo and Damascus; Yerevan, Armenia; and small 
cities in India, like Kochi and Nagpur.
Mideast budget airlines offer services similar to their U.S. counterparts, from guaranteed seats and meals for 
purchase on board to free checked luggage up to 44 pounds. Jazeera offers a 'Jazeera Plus' business-class

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has retracted a claim that the airline had cut emissions 
of carbon dioxide by half over the past five years
O'Leary admitted this statement was 'an error' following an investigation by BBC Newsnight, which demonstrated 
that the claim could not be true.
Ryanair had initially threatened the programme with legal action if it aired the report. Ryanair describes itself as 
Europe's greenest, cleanest airline.
The no-frills carrier has since admitted its fuel use has increased eight-fold between 1998 and 2006. Experts says 
this means Ryanair emissions of carbon dioxide will have also risen eight-fold over the same period.
O'Leary originally made the claim that Ryanair had cut carbon dioxide emissions by half at a press conference on 
Jan 10. However, when challenged to provide the figure to back up these claims, Ryanair said it did not have the 
information.

PARIS (AFX) - Ryanair is being investigated by Marseilles prosecutors after the low-cost airline failed to obtain 
authorisation for new routes between Marseilles and Morocco last November before offering tickets for sale, legal 
sources told Agence France-Presse.
The sources said authorities have received some 40 complaints accusing the company of selling promotional 
tickets before getting the green light for the routes.
Last November, Ryanair postponed the flights after completion of an open skies agreement the European Union 
and Morocco was delayed.
The opening of the new routes was pushed back to December and the airline said it would reimburse tickets or offer 
alternative flights.
Ryanair's sales manager for France, Matthieu Glasson, denied any fraudulent activity on the airlines's part. He told 
AFP that all affected customers who had applied for a refund had been granted one.

VIENNA (AFX) - Shares in Austrian Airlines (AUA) continued to gain in afternoon trade, boosted by a report by BNP 
Exane Paribas that it had added the national carrier to its list of potential M&A targets, with Deutsche Lufthansa the 
likely buyer, traders said.
'We see a rising probability that Lufthansa could make a bid for Austrian Airlines towards the end of 2007 or the 
beginning of 2008,' said BNP in a comment on the troubled airline.
Thanks to severe restructuring measures undertaken by AUA management over the past year, BNP Exane Paribas 
said it believes the airline can turn around its loss-making forecast for 2006 and see a return to profitability in EBIT 
margin of around 4 pct in 2007.
Shares in Austrian Airlines have continued to soar since the beginning of the year, gaining over 30 pct in value on a 
slew of positive reports, including a dramatic increase in the load factor to a record of over 74 pct.
Today's suggestion by BNP echoed the comment earlier this month by Ryanair CEO Michael o'Leary that AUA 
would have no future unless it banded together with another airline, while branding its management 'idiots' for 
reintroducing free meals.
At 3.50 pm, shares in Austrian Airlines were trading up 1.20 pct at 10.00 eur, while the ATX Prime index was at 
2,291.64 up 0.26 pct.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Lufthansa and Iberia were upgraded to 'buy' from 'neutral' at UBS, in a note on the 
European airline industry, due to falling oil prices, dealers said.
The broker also lifted its price targets across the sector with British Airways moving to 650 pence from 600, Air 
France-KLM to 40 eur from 35, easyJet to 800p from 700 and Ryanair to 13 eur from 11.
In a note to clients, UBS said it believes the next significant catalyst for the airline sector will be upgrades on lower 
fuel cost.
Without being reflected in consensus forecasts, oil prices have fallen considerably, allowing airlines to hedge at 
lower levels.
Furthermore, capacity growth in Europe in both short and long haul should be benign in the next 12-18 months.

DAVOS INTERVIEW Stelios quashes talk about long-haul budget flight alliance
DAVOS INTERVIEW Stelios quashes talk about long-haul budget flight 
alliance

DAVOS, Switzerland (AFX) - Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of no-frills airline easyJet PLC, has dismissed 
reports that he is in talks to form a global alliance to launch low-cost, long-haul flights.
Sir Stelios, easyJet's largest shareholder, said there was 'no substance at all' to a report in a Malaysian newspaper 
earlier this month claiming he was in talks with Sir Richard Branson and AirAsia's chief Tony Fernandes about 
setting up 'the world's first low-cost global network' based in Malaysia.
'No offence to Tony, who's a personal friend of mine, but easyJet is designed to do one thing and that's short haul 
flights,' Sir Stelios told AFX News in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
'I think it would be a major deviation from our business plan if we considered long-haul flights.'
Sir Stelios, who was knighted last year, created easyJet when he was 28 and has seen it grow to one of Europe's 
biggest airlines. The Luton-based budget carrier now has a fleet of 122 jets and carried 33 mln passengers in 2006.
The 39-year-old entrepreneur said the airline is 'on a good track' and its future involves building on its established 
strategy.
'It's going to be about buying more planes and doing more of the same, linking cities more often,' he said, while 
declining to give specific details of the airline's plans.
He said his family still owned about 40 pct of easyJet and there were no plans to change that.
Sir Stelios has been talking about climate change in Davos and said the agenda of the summit in the Swiss ski 
resort 'clearly had been determined' by the issue.
The chief executive of EasyJet's rival Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, has been an outspoken critic of those calling for 
tougher measures to combat aviation's contribution to climate change.
Ryanair has launched a campaign against UK tax increases on flights and O'Leary has urged governments and 
environmentalists to focus their fire on emerging economies and road transport rather than aviation, which he 
claims accounts for just 1.6 pct of all carbon emissions.
DAVOS INTERVIEW Stelios quashes talk about long-haul budget flight alliance
Sir Stelios dismissed claims by what he described as some 'lone voices' claiming that climate change was not 
happening.
'That debate is over and the question is what we do about it, not if,' he said.
Sir Stelios said the European Union was the best platform in Europe to take the issue forward, rather than individual 
governments, and he said easyJet supports proposals to include aviation in EU emissions trading arrangements.
However, he said: 'The (EU) is not ultimately the ideal organisation because it is not global. There are issues about 
how we get the US and Asia to play ball.'
Stelios claimed easyJet was 30 pct more environmentally friendly than British Airways PLC in terms of emissions 
per passenger.
'I believe easyJet is well positioned (on climate change) because we have a very modern fleet and by accident our 
business model is very environmentally friendly,' he said.
'We put more seats on our planes (than other airlines) and we fill more of them.'
He said, however, that he did not believe aviation, travel and tourism were 'the single biggest culprits' on climate 
change.
'Travel boosts economic activity and promotes cultural interaction and I think it would be a sad and more dangerous 
world if travelling around was considered to be a bad thing,' he said.
Sir Stelios said other businesses launched by his investment vehicle easyGroup, particularly easyCar and 
easyHotel, were doing well.
He said easyHotel plans to have opened four more hotels by the end of this year in addition to the current two in 
London and Basel, Switzerland.
The group has also agreed a franchise arrangement with Dubai-based group Istithmar to open 38 hotels during the 
next five years in the Middle East and North Africa.
Budget cruise operator easyCruise hopes to add a further vessel to its fleet of two ships by the end of the year, Sir 
Stelios said.
EasyBus, which currently runs budget bus services between London and Luton airport in Bedfordshire in the UK, 
has plans to start operating from Stansted airport in the next three months and from Gatwick by the summer.
Asked whether easyGroup had plans to follow in the footsteps of Virgin's Sir Richard Branson by running UK rail 
franchises, Sir Stelios said: 'No, we've got no plans to run trains - there's too much government intervention. He can 
keep the trains for himself.'

LONDON (AFX) - The European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA) has criticised plans by the European 
Commission (EC) to regulate charges at European airports.
The EC says it wants to help airlines by 'preventing excessive increases in charges'. However, the Ryanair PLC-
backed ELFAA has branded the plans as 'unnecessary'.
John Hanlon, ELFAA's secretary general, said in a statement: 'ELFAA has repeatedly said that competition and not 
regulation should determine the future of Europe's airports. The emergence of low fares airlines offering direct, 
point-to-point services has rejuvenated previously under-utilised regional and secondary airports across Europe and 
the resulting increased competition has forced these and some of the main city airports to seek efficiencies and 
lower their charges.
'There is therefore no need to regulate these competitive airports, as regulating them will only impose an 
unnecessary administrative burden and increase costs without positively impacting the level of charges.'
The EC's plan, which needs the approval of the European Parliament and European governments, requires all 
European countries to set up independent regulators to oversee airport charges at airports with more than 1 mln 
passengers each year.
Under the plan, airports have to make their charges totally transparent, and airlines are to be given a detailed 
breakdown of all the elements of their charges.
'Until now, European airports have been faced with diverse regulatory, commercial and external challenges 
regarding issues such as capacity, financing and the environment,' EC Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot 
said in a statement.
'The aim of these new measures is to offer a common set of rules to be applied and enforced uniformly throughout 
Europe.'
The Association of European Airlines, which represents Air France PLC and British Airways PLC, welcomed the 
proposals as 'a step in the right direction'.

SINGAPORE (XFN-ASIA) - Tiger Airways will be ready for an initial public offering (IPO) by the end of this year, the 
Business Times reported, quoting the budget airline's chief executive, Tony Davis.
The newspaper also quoted Davis as saying that Tiger Airways is preparing to make its first investment overseas, in 
an airline somewhere in the Asia-Pacific region which he did not identify.
He said the investment would be small one to begin with, and that Tiger Airways would help it grow.
The Business Times remarked that Davis had recently joined the board of Advent Holdings. Advent Holdings owns 
and operates budget carrier Skywest Airlines, which is based in the Western Australian city of Perth.
Singapore Airlines Ltd owns 49 pct of Tiger Airways, government-linked investment company Temasek Holdings 
owns 11 pct and the rest is split between Tony Ryan (the founder of European low-cost airline Ryanair) and US 
private investor Indigo Partners.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair PLC chief executive Michael O'Leary has hit back at claims that the European 
Commission could prohibit the airline's lapsed bid for rival Aer Lingus, saying the commission 'doesn't have the 
power' to stop it.
If the Commission, which is the European Union's executive arm, decides against Ryanair's bid, some lawyers say 
it could even go so far as to force it to sell its 25 pct stake.
The Commission will decide by May 11 whether to prohibit the deal on competition grounds. However, O'Leary 
believes this is unlikely to happen.
'No, they don't have the power to do it [prohibit the deal] and we don't intend to let them do it,' O'Leary said at a 
press conference this morning. 'We have no power at Aer Lingus anyway and have had to issue press releases 
asking them to end their fuel surcharges so that shows how much influence we have there.'
Ryanair says it will make a second offer for Ireland's flag-carrier if permitted but the airline may well be forced to sell 
all its Aer Lingus holdings if the European Commission's decision goes against it.

LONDON (AFX) - Low-cost airline Ryanair PLC has launched a campaign offering 1 mln free flights to passengers 
who write to UK chancellor Gordon Brown to voice their disapproval about the forthcoming 10 stg air passenger 
duty bill.
The government, which raised the charge from 5 stg, said the increase is a response to growing fears the aviation 
industry is a significant contributor to global warming.
As part of Ryanair's campaign, passengers can send the chancellor an email though Ryanair's website when a 
booking is made.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: 'Gordon Brown has not responded to the letter I sent him asking what he is 
going to do with the 1 bln stg so the more messages of disapproval he gets from the public, the better.'
The tax increase will take effect from February 1.

VIENNA (AFX) - Michael O'Leary, CEO of Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, said Austrian Airlines (AUA) has no future 
unless it bands together with another airline, and called its management 'idiots' for reintroducing free meals.
In an interview in the latest edition of the current affairs magazine News, O'Leary said that, like many small national 
airlines, the only way for AUA to survive is to join forces with another airline, for example Lufthansa.
'Nothing's for free on Ryanair flights, we sell everything. Not like these idiots in Austria,' he told News, referring to 
AUA's decision to reintroduce free meals for its economy class passengers.
O'Leary was also dismissive of the merger between FlyNiki -- the Austrian low-cost domestic carrier owned by 
former F1 driver Niki Lauda -- and Air Berlin.
'If you put two expensive, loss making airlines together, then you just get another even more expensive and even 
greater loss making airline,' he said.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Iberia and Finnair advanced in late morning trade, spurred by an upgrade to 'buy' from 
'hold' by ABN Amro as part of a sector review, while Ryanair was downgraded to 'sell' from 'hold', dealers said.
In a note this morning, ABN Amro said it sees the best returns this year from the smaller European airlines, geared 
to falling oil prices and the US dollar.
The broker maintained a cautious stance towards European majors, noting that profits at Air France-KLM -- rated 
'sell' -- British Airways and Lufthansa -- both rated 'hold' -- are being sustained by strong long-haul premium traffic 
demand, and effective hedging, which the broker does not expect will endure.
Regarding Iberia, the broker said the group is geared to oil, and is benefiting from Latin American routes, while 
adding it could be a 'legitimate consolidation target'.
ABN Amro said it likes Nordic airlines, noting that Finnair has declined 9 pct while the European majors were up 73 
pct on average.
The broker reiterated its 'buy' recommendation on SAS.
Regarding the low-cost carriers, the broker finds Air Berlin -- 'buy' -- the most attractive, while Ryanair was the least.
The broker said that easyJet and Ryanair revenues are at risk from the doubling UK Air Passenger Duty.
At 11.05 am, shares in Iberia were up 0.06 at 3.02 while Finnair was up 0.42 at 13.03 .

BRUSSELS (AFX) - Irish low-cost air carrier Ryanair plans to base as many as 11 new aircraft at Charleroi airport, 
50 km south of Brussels, according to the airport's spokesperson.
'We have been told several times by Ryanair that when the new terminal comes into service in the fourth quarter of 
2007, operations will be expanded,' Pierre Fernemont told AFP, confirming press reports in Belgian daily L'Echo.
The new terminal will process 3 mln passengers per year instead of the current 2 mln.
Currently, Ryanair has 4 planes based at Charleroi, but Fernemont says this could grow to as many as 15 once the 
terminal expands.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair were cut to 'hold' from 'buy' but with a raised target price of 12.2 eur from 10 at 
Citigroup this morning saying easyJet has more room for margin recovery, dealers said.
Citigroup said that it sees the sector benefiting from low fuel costs and a weaker US dollar.
It believes Ryanair has the strongest business model for a European airline in terms of its lowest-cost advantage, 
continued growth prospects, and strong balance sheet.
It said that even though the UK market is nearing maturity in terms of the penetration of low-fare airlines, 
Continental Europe is relatively underserved and opportunities there should enable the airline to grow revenue by 
around 20 pct per annum.
Inevitably, it thought revenue growth, margins and EPS growth should gradually decline as Ryanair gets larger.
With regard to easyJet, which it rates 'buy', it remains positive on the airline's long-term strategic position as well as 
15-20 pct annual growth prospects for the low-fares market in Europe.
It thought that the new management team is likely to be more focused on financial discipline and boosting 
shareholder value.
It said that aggressive cost management and improving ancillary revenue justify its 740 pence target price.

EasyJet loses request for interim ruling on French labour case appeal
EasyJet loses request for interim ruling on French labour case appeal

PARIS (AFX) - France's State Council has rejected a request from EasyJet for an immediate interim ruling on its 
appeal of a French decree passed in November, which decided that EasyJet staff based in France are subject to 
French labour laws.
The airline claims that its employees working at the Orly airport outside Paris should be considered UK employees, 
but the government decree would require both EasyJet and fellow low-cost carrier Ryanair to set up French 
subsidiaries for their French-based staff.
In a statement, the council said there is 'no need to take an urgent decision' on the case.
A full ruling from the State Council, the country's highest court for complaints about the French state or 
administration, is expected in the coming months.

The commission launches first-phase inquiries into all deals that meet EU merger thresholds. These 
inquiries last one month, but are extended by two weeks when companies offer remedies or when a national 
competition authority asks to rule on the deal. A deal that is not expected to raise competition concerns 
may be submitted as a candidate for the EU's simplified merger procedure, a reduced regulatory process. 
The commission is entitled to transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.
IN-DEPTH SECOND PHASE INVESTIGATIONS
April 17 
-Proposed merger agreement between Thales, Finmeccanica SpA, Alcatel and Telespazio on space ops
April 23
-Proposed acquisition by Johnson Controls INC's VB Autobatterie GmbH of FIAMM group's automotive starter 
battery business
May 11
-Proposed acquisition by Ryanair Holdings of Aer Lingus Group PLC
May 15
-Proposed acquisition by CVC Capital Partners and Ferd Industrial Holding's Elopak unit of SIG Holding AG
June 1
-Proposed acquisition by Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group of BMG Music Publishing
The commission opens in-depth probes lasting up to four months if competition concerns cannot be resolved during 
the first-phase inquiry.

Ryanair welcomes EU Ombudsman's call to change leaflets on air passenger rights
Ryanair welcomes EU Ombudsman's call to change leaflets on air passenger

LONDON (AFX) - No-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has applauded a decision by the European Ombudsman to 
ask the European Commission to amend publicity material about new European rules on air passenger rights.
Ryanair said it was 'a welcome development' that Nikiforos Diamandouros had identified certain 'inaccurate and 
misleading' statements in the leaflets, posters and video presentations and asked the commission to put them right.
The commission published publicity material in February, 2005, telling travellers about new EU rules governing 
compensation and help if their flights were delayed or cancelled, or if they were not allowed to board their aircraft.
However, two airline associations complained that a number of statements in the material were inaccurate and 
misleading.
One of the statements said: 'If you are denied boarding or your flight is cancelled, the airline operating your flight 
must offer you financial compensation and assistance.'
The ombudsman said he considered this sentence 'wrongly suggests that compensation has to be paid in every 
case where a flight is cancelled'.
He said he also agreed with some other complaints made by the associations, although he said he did not find all 
their allegations to be justified.
Dublin-based Ryanair said it had asked for the legislation itself to be dropped.
It claimed the new rules force airlines to compensate and assist passengers for delays and cancellations even in 
cases where the airlines were not responsible for the problems.
'The cost of this compensation and assistance is often several times the amount of the original fare. Other 
competing forms of transportation have no such requirements,' Ryanair said in a statement.

MADRID (AFX) - Ryanair SA said it will create a third hub in Spain, in the city of Reus, Tarragona, as soon as the 
infrastructure is complete.
Ryanair director of marketing for Spain and Portugal, Maribel Rodriguez, said the company 'has reached an 
agreement' for the new hub, although 'everything depends on the infrastructure of the airport, which has to be 
adapted.'
Ryanair has two other hubs in Madrid and Gerona.
Separately, Rodriguez said Ryanair is 'surprised' at the news that the Spanish government is finalizing a deal with 
German charter company LTU to take over Air Madrid's slots.
Ryanair had expected the slots to be divided up between all the airlines, she said.
'It was a surprise, we thought the slots would be included in the pool,' she said.
Rodriguez noted that Ryanair is only focused on flights within Europe and is not interested in Air Madrid's long 
distance slots to Latin America.
According to press reports, airline industry groups and unions are studying the legality of the agreement between 
the Public Works Ministry and LTU, under which LTU would take over six of the 10 slots that Air Madrid had at the 
Barajas airport in Madrid.

MILAN (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC plans to double its traffic to and from Italy in the next five years, from 12 mln 
passengers seen in year to March, said south Europe sales and marketing director Bridget Dowling.
Speaking at a news conference, Dowling also said that plans to overhaul regulation in Italy's air sector, particularly 
regional airport use, are 'ridiculous' and favour Alitalia SpA.
'This proposal is ridiculous. Transport minister Alessandro Bianchi has the responsibility to help Alitalia, but should 
not forget that he must encourage traffic in all regions,' she said.
Ryanair is particularly concerned by reports the plan would restrict international flights from regional airports 
handling less than 5 mln passengers per year, she said.
In Italy, Ryanair operates 114 domestic and international routes from 22 airports across the country.
Dowling said Bianchi has admitted in newspaper interviews he wants to help Alitalia, adding Ryanair has already 
'mentioned' the Italy plan to the European Commission in their contacts.
'If the (proposal) goes ahead, there will certainly be consequences,' she said, without giving further details.
Ryanair has no interest in bidding for Alitalia in the privatisation, while a new owner for the flag carrier could 
promote healthy competition, she said.
Dowling also commented on local concerns about noise at Rome's Ciampino airport, and said Italy's sector 
regulator is studying the noise generated by different users, including Ryanair.
She said Ryanair has the youngest fleet in Europe, is not to blame for the noise at Ciampino, and does not fly at 
night, noting how the airport is also used by military and carrier services.
The regulator could ask users to cut Ciampino traffic back to 2000 levels, equivalent to halving Ryanair's 3 mln 
passengers a year, she said.
Ryanair is ready to leave Ciampino if the issue is not resolved, she said, adding that slots at Rome's Fiumicino 
airport are not available and would be too expensive to acquire.
Ryanair to double Italy traffic in 5 yrs; worries on sector regulation proposal
On expansion, Dowling said Ryanair's Italian activities are among the group's fastest growing. Routes from Milan to 
Nottingham in England, and Valladolid will be added in Feb-March.
Ryanair could open a fourth Italian hub at Treviso in the north east, but no final decision has been taken, she said.

    -Telefonica could also see buying interest after a report in The Times that the group is in talks with 
Apple to be its carrier for the new iPhone within Europe. Apple saw strong gains in the US yesterday amid 
the hype surrounding the much awaited presentation of the new phone.
    -Endesa will remain in focus after the Supreme Court lifted the injunction on Gas Natural's bid, a 
move which also helps to free up E.On's bid for the utility. If a Madrid court today also decides to 
unblock the process, the next step will be a sealed envelope process, analysts said.

LONDON (AFX) - Low-cost airline Ryanair has written to Britain's chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown 
asking him to scrap proposals to double air passenger duty (APD).
In his pre-budget report on Dec 6, Brown said APD rates will increase from Feb 1 this year. Short-haul passengers 
in the lowest class of travel will pay 10 stg, up from 5 stg, and in other classes they will pay pay 20 stg, up from 10 
stg. Long-haul passengers in the lowest class of travel will pay 40 stg, up from 20 stg, and in others they will pay 80 
stg, up from 40 stg.
In a statement issued today, Ryanair said: 'Gordon Browns decision to double APD from 5 stg to 10 stg per ticket 
will generate over 1 bln stg in tax revenue for the Government. At 10 stg on an average 28 stg ticket, Ryanair 
passengers are being taxed at over 35 pct. These taxes are regressive and ineffective.
'Gordon Brown wont spend any of this money on the environment. He is just using the environment to steal more 
taxes from ordinary passengers', the airline added.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Inmarsat have been upgraded to 'buy' from 'neutral' at Merill Lynch with a price 
objective of 455 pence, which it said implied a 24 pct upside including a 4 pct dividend yield, according to dealers.
Merrill Lynch said Inmarsats third-quarter results in November showed the core business is performing well across 
the board. In addition, it said early indications on BGAN -- its voice and broadband data mobile communications 
service -- are positive.
The broker said that it was most encouraged by managements comments that BGAN is not significantly 
cannibalising legacy revenues yet, and is encouraging new users.
It noted that Ryanair and Emirates will launch in-flight telephony services in the coming months and several others 
are undergoing trials.
Merrill thought that this could represent an additional 100 mln usd a year opportunity for Inmarsat.

ROUNDUP Airlines give mixed reaction to UK govt's climate change

LONDON (AFX) - The airline industry has given a mixed reaction to a UK government minister's claims that major 
airlines are failing to take climate change seriously.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement that the comments by environment minister Ian 
Pearson were 'foolish and ill-informed'.
However, rival budget carrier easyJet and Friends of the Earth welcomed the minister's intervention, saying the 
government and the European Union should speed up moves to include aviation in European carbon emissions 
trading arrangements.
In a report in the Guardian newspaper, Pearson branded Ryanair as the 'irresponsible face of capitalism' and said 
O'Leary was refusing to recognise climate change as a genuine problem.
The minister described the attitude of major American airlines as 'a disgrace' and warned that British Airways PLC 
was 'only just about playing ball' in the fight to reduce carbon emissions.
O'Leary said in a statement that he believed Pearson 'hasn't a clue what he's talking about' and claimed that 
airlines were neither the cause nor the solution to climate change.
He said Pearson had not said anything about emissions from road transport and the power generation industry, 
which he claimed were higher than those of aviation.
'At a time when aviation generates just 1.6 pct of greenhouse gases, isn't it time that Minister Pearson and other 
equally foolish politicians actually tackled the real causes of climate change?' O'Leary said.
Pearson believes the predicted growth in airlines' carbon emissions are such a threat to the government's plans to 
cut emissions by 60 pct by 2050 that he wants the European Union to go further -- and faster -- and include airline 
emissions in its trading scheme, the Guardian reported.
A statement from the UK Department of the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said: 'Urgent progress is 
needed to ensure aviation addresses its climate change impacts.
ROUNDUP Airlines give mixed reaction to UK govt's climate change criticism
'The UK has led the debate within Europe to include aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme and the recent 
announcement by the (European) Commission is a step forward in ensuring the environmental costs of aviation's 
climate change impacts are taken into account.
'We must work urgently with the aviation sector, the European Commission and other governments to put in place 
an ambitious scheme that is environmentally effective and one which is implemented as soon as possible, driving 
down emissions further and faster.'
Andy Harrison, easyJet chief executive said: 'We congratulate Mr Pearson for his clear words and for refraining 
from lumping all airlines together. In contrast to most other airlines, easyJet has not only welcomed a carbon trading 
scheme, but has also called on the European Parliament to bring in tougher legislation sooner.
'The EU must discourage airlines from flying old, half-empty aircraft and must prevent non-EU airlines from getting 
a free ride.'
A statement from environmental lobby group Friends of the Earth said: 'Mr Pearson is right to be concerned about 
the refusal of the aviation industry to take climate change seriously.
'This is why government action to tackle the sector's rising emissions is urgently required. Plans to allow UK airports 
to be expanded should be scrapped and the multi-billion pound tax-breaks that the sector receives must end.
'Furthermore, Government plans to cut carbon dioxide must also include international aviation emissions.'

LONDON (AFX) - The airline industry has given a mixed reaction to a UK government minister's claims that major 
airlines are failing to take climate change seriously.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement that the comments by environment minister Ian 
Pearson were 'foolish and ill-informed'.
However, rival budget carrier easyJet and Friends of the Earth welcomed the minister's intervention, saying the 
government and the European Union should speed up moves to include aviation in European carbon emissions 
trading arrangements.
In a report in the Guardian newspaper, Pearson branded Ryanair as the 'irresponsible face of capitalism' and said 
O'Leary was refusing to recognise climate change as a genuine problem.
The minister described the attitude of major American airlines as 'a disgrace' and warned that British Airways PLC 
was 'only just about playing ball' in the fight to reduce carbon emissions.
O'Leary said in a statement that he believed Pearson 'hasn't a clue what he's talking about' and claimed that 
airlines were neither the cause nor the solution to climate change.
He said Pearson had not said anything about emissions from road transport and the power generation industry, 
which he claimed were higher than those of aviation.
'At a time when aviation generates just 1.6 pct of greenhouse gases, isn't it time that Minister Pearson and other 
equally foolish politicians actually tackled the real causes of climate change?' O'Leary said.
Pearson believes the predicted growth in airlines' carbon emissions are such a threat to the government's plans to 
cut emissions by 60 pct by 2050 that he wants the European Union to go further -- and faster -- and include airline 
emissions in its trading scheme, the Guardian reported.
A statement from the UK Department of the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said: 'Urgent progress is 
needed to ensure aviation addresses its climate change impacts.
ROUNDUP Airlines give mixed reaction to UK govt's climate change criticism
'The UK has led the debate within Europe to include aviation in the Emissions Trading Scheme and the recent 
announcement by the (European) Commission is a step forward in ensuring the environmental costs of aviation's 
climate change impacts are taken into account.
'We must work urgently with the aviation sector, the European Commission and other governments to put in place 
an ambitious scheme that is environmentally effective and one which is implemented as soon as possible, driving 
down emissions further and faster.'
Andy Harrison, easyJet chief executive said: 'We congratulate Mr Pearson for his clear words and for refraining 
from lumping all airlines together. In contrast to most other airlines, easyJet has not only welcomed a carbon trading 
scheme, but has also called on the European Parliament to bring in tougher legislation sooner.
'The EU must discourage airlines from flying old, half-empty aircraft and must prevent non-EU airlines from getting 
a free ride.'
A statement from environmental lobby group Friends of the Earth said: 'Mr Pearson is right to be concerned about 
the refusal of the aviation industry to take climate change seriously.
'This is why government action to tackle the sector's rising emissions is urgently required. Plans to allow UK airports 
to be expanded should be scrapped and the multi-billion pound tax-breaks that the sector receives must end.
'Furthermore, Government plans to cut carbon dioxide must also include international aviation emissions.'

SINGAPORE (XFN-ASIA) - Budget airline, Tiger Airways said it has secured a 100 mln usd loan facility to finance 
the pre-delivery deposits for eight new Airbus A320 aircraft.
The facility is being arranged and underwritten by BNP Paribas and will be drawn down over the next three to four 
years, it said.
The airline placed an order for the aircraft, worth more than 500 mln usd, last October. They are scheduled to be 
delivered from 2008 to 2010.
This purchase will help expand its fleet to at least 20 Airbus A320 aircraft by 2010, it said.
Tiger Airways is jointly owned by Singapore Airlines, Temasek Holdings, Tony Ryan, the founder of European low-
cost airline Ryanair, and US private investor Indigo Partners.

NEW YORK (AFX) - American depositary shares of Ryanair Holdings PLC soared to a 52-week high on 
Wednesday amid lower crude oil prices. An analyst also raised his price target on the Irish discount airline by $36.
A barrel of high-quality crude oil gave up $2.50 cents to $58.55 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Jet fuel, 
which is refined from crude oil, is among the industry's top costs.
Ryanair shares climbed $3.45, or 4 percent, to $84.95 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after topping out at a yearly 
high of $85.28 earlier in the session. In a previous 52-week range, the stock has traded in a range of $46.47 to 
$82.22.
On Tuesday, Prudential Equity Group analyst Bob McAdoo raised his price target to $108 from $72 and kept an 
'Overweight' rating on the shares.
McAdoo said his fiscal 2008 of $4.49 per share includes lower fuel prices, capacity growth around 20 percent, and 
slight improvements in unit costs offset by slightly lower revenue per passenger from a year ago.
McAdoo also said operating and net margins for fiscal 2008 are slightly higher than his estimated fiscal 2007 
margins, due mostly to lower jet fuel costs.
Still, McAdoo warned that fluctuations in the price of fuel, among other factors, can affect airline stocks.
'Although we believe the airline industry is returning to a more profitable state, fuel prices could climb again to 
record levels or beyond,' McAdoo wrote in a client note. 'If this were to occur, all airline shares would likely be hit, 
and could return to the low levels not seen since fall 2004.'

GENEVA (AFX) - Discount airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has lost its battle to win control of an Internet domain 
name from a disgruntled former customer, according to a ruling issued by a United Nations panel Wednesday.
Michael Coulston of London set up a Web site critical of Ryanair's business practices in July under the domain 
name http://www.ryanaircampaign.org.
The Irish carrier complained to the World Intellectual Property Organization that the domain name infringed on its 
trademarks and should therefore be transferred into Ryanair's possession.
But a WIPO panel said there was no evidence that Coulston, who runs a private online campaign aimed at 
informing Ryanair customers of ways in which they can complain to the company about its service, was using the 
domain name in bad faith.
The U.N. arbitration system, which started in 1999, allows those who think they have the right to a domain to get it 
back without having to fight a costly legal battle or pay large sums of money.
Ryanair 
had 
previously 
succeeded 
in 
forcing 
Coulston 
to 
hand 
over 
another 
domain 
name, 
http://www.ryanair.org.uk, by lodging a complaint with Nominet UK, an organization responsible for Web domains 
ending in the .UK suffix.

GENEVA (AFX) - Discount airline Ryanair Holdings PLC has lost its battle to win control of an Internet domain 
name from a disgruntled former customer, according to a ruling issued by a United Nations panel Wednesday.
Michael Coulston of London set up a Web site critical of Ryanair's business practices in July under the domain 
name http://www.ryanaircampaign.org.
The Irish carrier complained to the World Intellectual Property Organization that the domain name infringed on its 
trademarks and should therefore be transferred into Ryanair's possession.
But a WIPO panel said there was no evidence that Coulston, who runs a private online campaign aimed at 
informing Ryanair customers of ways in which they can complain to the company about its service, was using the 
domain name in bad faith.
The U.N. arbitration system, which started in 1999, allows those who think they have the right to a domain to get it 
back without having to fight a costly legal battle or pay large sums of money.
Ryanair 
had 
previously 
succeeded 
in 
forcing 
Coulston 
to 
hand 
over 
another 
domain 
name, 
http://www.ryanair.org.uk, by lodging a complaint with Nominet UK, an organization responsible for Web domains 
ending in the .UK suffix.

ROUNDUP Airlines cancel flights due to fog, services delayed

LONDON (AFX) - Dense fog caused airlines to cancel and delay scores of flights on Friday, sparking misery for 
hundreds of travellers going away for the Christmas break.
British Airways PLC said it axed all 84 of its daily domestic services and 86 of its 316 European services to and 
from Heathrow, although long haul services are running normally.
Airport operator BAA, owned by Spanish construction firm Grupo Ferrovial SA, said 174 flights at Heathrow had 
been cancelled so far on Friday, the majority of which were BA domestic and short haul services.
The fog and low cloud cover is reportedly also affecting services at Gatwick, Stansted, Luton and Southampton 
airports. London City airport had closed its runway, according to the BBC.
A spokesman for BAA at Stansted said there had been no cancellations this morning, although major airlines are 
experiencing delays of about an hour due to reduced take-offs and landings.
No-frills airline Ryanair said it had cancelled one flight and diverted another this morning due to the fog at Gatwick 
and Stansted.
It said there were one hour delays at Stansted and some delays at East Midlands and Liverpool airports, while 
disruption in the UK had caused knock-on delays for some European flights and services to and from the Irish 
republic.
Luton-based easyJet, which cancelled about 10 flights yesterday out of a total daily schedule of 760 services, said it 
was experiencing delays across its network, although all flights had operated.
The fog has forced air traffic controllers to cut the number of aircraft flying into and out of Heathrow, where BA is 
one of the biggest operators.
A spokesman for the UK Meteorological Office said visibility at Heathrow this morning was 500 metres and 
temperatures were below freezing, making it less likely that the fog would clear.
He said the fog would probably remain through today and overnight, but may start to clear in southern England late 
tomorrow morning and tomorrow afternoon.
'It's not all doom and gloom. There is a possibility of slightly better conditions tomorrow,' he said.
ROUNDUP Airlines cancel flights due to fog, services delayed
BA said it had decided to use a long haul Boeing 747 jumbo jet and a Boeing 777 on some short haul services from 
Heathrow to Madrid, Frankfurt, Geneva and Copenhagen on Friday and during the weekend to help increase the 
number of available seats.
It said it was able to fly more than 450 customers on a return service between London Gatwick and Edinburgh on 
Thursday afternoon by using a long haul Boeing 777 rather than the usual much smaller Boeing 737 used on the 
route.
The airline is also using coaches to transfer passengers from Heathrow to other airports in the UK and between 
London and Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.
Geoff Want, BA's director of ground operations, apologised to customers for the disruption, which has caused long 
delays for people travelling ahead of the Christmas break.
'The weather across much of the UK is regrettably showing little sign of improvement for Friday and therefore we 
have no option but to make some more cancellations,' he said.
'Faced with the likelihood of continuing fog, we are urging our customers due to travel over the weekend on 
domestic services to and from London Heathrow to begin thinking about alternative ways of travelling wherever 
possible in case the current weather persists.'

Ryanair withdraws bid to buy Aer Lingus

DUBLIN (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday it is immediately withdrawing its offer to buy Aer Lingus after 
EU regulators launched a probe into its hostile bid for the Irish carrier.
The no-frills carrier said its 1.48 billion euros ($1.9 billion) offer was now void. It said it would only make another 
offer if the European Commission approved the proposed takeover.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O' Leary accused European Commission competition officials of bias against his 
airline. He noted that the same authority approved a deal between Air France SA and Dutch carrier KLM.
In that transaction, the parties offered to surrender 120 landing slots, O'Leary said. Ryanair offered as part of its bid 
to surrender more than 500 slots -- including slots currently belonging to Aer Lingus Group PLC, he said.
'The commission appears to apply different and totally inconsistent principles to the Ryanair-Aer Lingus deal than it 
applied to the much larger Air France-KLM deal, which was waved through with little difficulty,' O' Leary said.
Ryanair insisted that under European Union competition rules, it could no longer continue with its bid. However, the 
EU executive regularly launches four-month investigations into deals where it sees possible problems and a 
decision to do so does not require the bidding company to withdraw its bid during the investigation.
The European Commission said earlier Thursday that it saw 'serious competition concerns' with the proposed deal 
to combine Ireland's two major airlines, saying it could reduce customer choice and lead to higher fares.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus have no other rivals on most routes out of Dublin and it was likely that the EU would have 
asked for more concessions before it could approve the combination. Regulators said solutions put forward by 
Ryanair in recent weeks did not go far enough to clear doubts about the deal.
Ryanair had put forward two plans to calm regulators' fears, but the commission said the first was 'not sufficient' to 
remove its serious doubts while the second was handed in too close to the deadline to be properly assessed.
O'Leary stressed Ryanair would publish a new bid as soon as regulators permitted it.
'Ryanair remains committed to acquiring Aer Lingus,' he said.
O'Leary declined to say whether Ryanair would increase its offer from the current bid price of 2.80 euros ($3.70).
Ryanair withdraws bid to buy Aer Lingus
Ryanair's bid already looked troubled, however. Aer Lingus and its largest shareholder, the Irish government, 
fiercely oppose the deal. Ryanair's offer has so far won over less than 1 percent of shareholders and it has so far 
failed to build its 25-percent stake into the controlling share it needs.
Ryanair has run into trouble with regulators before and was ordered to pay back millions of euros in subsidies it 
received from the Belgian regional government of Wallonia to help run flights out of Charleroi. However, Ryanair 
has also made similar complaints about unfair state subsidies given to Air France.
Ryanair stunned Ireland Oct. 5 when it launched its surprise bid, barely a week after the Irish government had 
floated most of its holding on the Irish and British stock exchanges at a share price of 2.20 euros ($2.85). At the 
time, Ryanair said it had bought 19.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares, but was legally restricted from buying more 
once the takeover plan sent Aer Lingus shares soaring above its bid price.
Analysts and investors almost universally viewed the current bid as doomed to fail. Analysts believe to be 
successful Ryanair will have to raise its bid above 2.80 euros ($3.70).
Growing rapidly from its Irish base, Ryanair has revolutionized travel in Europe, spearheading low-frills cheap flights 
that forced Aer Lingus to do the same.

Ryanair withdraws bid to buy Aer Lingus

DUBLIN (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said Thursday that it is immediately withdrawing its offer to buy Aer Lingus 
after EU regulators launched a probe into its hostile bid for the Irish carrier.
The no-frills carrier said the offer was now void. It said it would only make another offer if the European Commission 
approved the proposed takeover.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O' Leary accused European Commission competition chiefs of bias against the 
carrier. He noted that the same authority approved a merger between Air France and Dutch airline KLM.
In that merger, the parties offered to surrender 120 flight slots, O'Leary said. Ryanair offered as part of its bid to 
surrender more than 500 slots -- including slots currently belonging to Aer Lingus PLC, he said.
'The commission appears to apply different and totally inconsistent principles to the Ryanair-Aer Lingus deal than it 
applied to the much larger Air France-KLM deal, which was waved through with little difficulty,' O' Leary said.
Ryanair insisted that under European Union competition rules, it could no longer continue with its bid. However, EU 
competition officials say these in-depth investigations are standard.
The EU said earlier Thursday that it had serious concerns about the deal, saying it would reduce choice for 
consumers and lead to higher fares. It's likely the EU would have asked for more concessions.
O'Leary stressed that Ryanair would publish a new bid as soon as regulators permitted it.
'Ryanair remains committed to acquiring Aer Lingus,' he said.

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Commission said it has launched an in-depth investigation into the takeover bid 
of part-privatised Irish airline Aer Lingus by its low-cost compatriot Ryanair.
The commission, the EU's competition regulator, said the proposed acquisition would raise 'serious competition 
concerns in the passenger air transport sector and in particular could reduce choice for consumers and could give 
rise to higher fares than would be likely if the two carriers remained separate.'
It said it would decide within 90 working days whether any merger would significantly impede competition in the EU 
area or a substantial part of it.

PARIS (AFX) - Low-cost airline EasyJet said it has lodged an appeal with France's State Council against a decree 
passed last month ruling that all airline staff based in France are subject to French labour law.
The company claims the law itself infringes existing EU law.
The State Council, France's highest court of appeal, said that the airline has lodged both a full appeal and an 
interim objection aimed at securing a quick decision.
In a separate action, but connected to the same ruling, EasyJet was placed under investigation Friday over 
allegations of infringing French employment law.
Tax and labour inspectors both raided the group's Paris offices last week to check for possible breaches of the law.
Two companies are currently concerned by the November ruling -- EasyJet and the Irish carrier Ryanair -- although 
La Tribune today reported that Air France unit Cityjet could also be affected.
EasyJet has said it 'abides by European employment law' and a spokesman today said the appeal claims that the 
new French law infringes this.
'The decree considers our base at (Paris airport) Orly is an operating base, but we consider it to be just a room 
(where staff can) relax.'
The decree defines the workplace, or 'centre of professional activity', as the place where employees go after 
completing their shifts, but EasyJet claims the plane itself is the workplace.
Under the November ruling, EasyJet should have created a local affiliate subject to French law.
EasyJet employs around 130 people at Orly under UK contracts.

BRUSSELS (AFX - The European Commission is 'very likely' to launch a competition probe into the hostile bid for 
part-privatised Irish airline Aer Lingus by its low-cost compatriot Ryanair on Wednesday, sources close to the 
matter said.
The sources said this is because Ryanair's proposed solutions to competition issues are insufficient.
Ryanair launched its 2.80 eur per share bid on Oct 5, valuing Aer Lingus at 1.481 bln eur, days after Aer Lingus 
was partially floated on the London and Dublin stock exchanges.
Ryanair wants the 50.1 pct holding that would give it management control.
The takeover bid is opposed by the Irish government, which has retained a key stake in the airline, a staff trust, the 
Aer Lingus management and trade unions.
Even so, Ryanair has amassed more than a fifth of the Aer Lingus stock.

LONDON (AFX) - Low-cost airline EasyJet is being investigated over allegations of infringing French employment 
legislation, a source in the public prosecutor's office said.
Yesterday, tax and labour inspectors raided the Paris offices of easyJet to check for possible breaches of the law.
The operation 'was aimed at establishing the judicial status of easyJet's operating base in Orly,' the site of Paris's 
second international airport, 'in relation to French labour laws,' a transport inspection official said.
Under a government decree adopted in November, low-cost airlines with bases in France must comply with French 
labour laws.
Two companies are currently concerned by the ruling -- easyJet and the Irish carrier Ryanair.
Contacted by AFP, an easyJet spokesman said Thursday that the company 'abides by European employment law'.
'EasyJet flight personnel are under British contracts, because the company is British, registered in Britain, and their 
place of work is the aircraft.'
'All the suppliers working on the ground at Orly are subcontractors' who fall under French labour law, he said.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in easyJet PLC remained higher in early deals as JP Morgan reiterated its 'overweight' 
rating, retaining the stock as its favourite European airline for 2007, dealers said.
At 8.55 am easyJet was up 0.5 pence at 623.5.
JP Morgan however, recognised that the biggest share price gains are probably in the past and that the stock is 
unlikely to double again in value on a 1-2 year view.
But it said its earnings growth is much stronger than rival Ryanair's over the next two years and its PER multiples 
are at a significant discount to its segment peer, indicating there is more performance to come from the shares.
JP Morgan said easyJet should be regarded as a growth stock since its compound EPS growth rate over the next 
three years is around 30 pct.

Australia's Qantas strategic direction will not change - bid consortium

SYDNEY (XFN-ASIA) - Qantas Airway Ltd's strategic direction will not change if a Macquarie Bank-led consortium 
succeeds in its 11.1 bln aud offer for the national flag carrier, a spokesman for the consortium, known as Airline 
Partners Australia (APA), told a news conference.
The offer of 5.60 aud a share followed APA's initial offer of 5.50 aud a share yesterday which was rejected by 
Qantas as being to complex and highly conditional.
APA director and deputy chairman of consortium member, Allco Finance Group Ltd, Bob
Mansfield, said the consortium believes the takeover will mark the next phase of Qantas' growth backed by 
stakeholders with long-term commitments to the company.
'Airline Partners Australia brings together leading Australian and global companies with substantial experience in 
the aviation sector, in operating airlines, in aircraft leasing and in operating airline core services,' Mansfield told the 
briefing.
Allco Finance Group has an 11 pct stake in the consortium, its offshoot, Allco Equity Partners, will have 35 pct, US 
based buy-out firm Texas Pacific Group less than 15 pct, Canadian investment firm Onex Corp nine pct and other 
foreign investment funds less than 15 pct.
Mansfield said Texas Pacific Group was the world's most successful investor in the airline industry, having turned 
around Continental Airlines. It has also held stakes in the former America West and Ireland's Ryanair.
'In the case of Continental, TPG took it from bankruptcy to be the top airline in North America,' Mansfield said.
He said Qantas faces a challenging environment as any airline does .
'In our view the share market sometimes has a short-term view than constrains management achieving the goals 
the way they would like to,' Mansfield said.
'Our commitment is absolutely to help Qantas grow - we back completely the current Qantas management team 
under Geoff Dixon and his objectives and plans for the company,' Mansfield said.
He said a key to the consortium's approach is that it offers patient capital.
Australia's Qantas strategic direction will not change - bid consortium
'In other words we have a longer term perspective than the day-to-day equity market,' Mansfield said.
He said the airline will remain majority Australian owned with two-thirds of its new board being Australian citizens.
'If accepted this proposal will see virtually no change from Qantas' current foreign ownership levels,' Mansfield said.
He said APA will back a 10 bln aud investment plan over the next five years which Qantas has already put together, 
including the acquisition of 70 new aircraft.
Mansfield said there are no plans to break up the airline or cut regional services and it does not involve moving 
maintenance operations offshore.
He added the offer price offer an attractive premium for Qantas shareholders, being 33 pct higher than the closing 
share price of 4.20 aud a share on Nov 6, the day before the first speculation about the offer; and 61 pct above 
Qantas' volume weighted average share price of 3.48 aud over the six months to that date.
Dixon, who said he plans to stay as chief executive for at least the next three years, said the share market has 
consistently undervalued Qantas despite the airline being among the best six performing airlines in the world.
'I don't think they have paid above the odds - I think they've paid for a good airline, well run and incredibly 
operationally safe,' Dixon told the briefing.
'We are very confident of the new owners - their ability to invest for us to move forward so (its) business as usual, 
just under new ownership,' he said.
Allco Equity Partners said it will raise 682 mln to part fund its share of the acquisition and become Qantas' largest 
shareholder.
The takeover proposal comes as Qantas is expanding its leisure low cost brand Jetstar internationally.
The Qantas board said its recommendation remains conditional on a superior offer not being received.
It said has appointed Grant Samuel & Associates to prepare an independent expert's report, including an estimate 
of the airline's value and whether the bid is fair and reasonable.
At 1:00 pm, Sydney, Qantas was trading up 0.25 aud or 4.91 pct at 5.34 aud.

BAA says structure benefits passengers & airlines, denies abuse of monopoly

LONDON (AFX) - Airports operator BAA, newly acquired by Grupo Ferrovial SA, has given a defiant response to 
the UK Office of Fair Trading's decision to refer it to the Competition Commission (CC).
BAA said in a statement this afternoon that it believed BAA's structure had benefited both passengers and airlines 
and that the company had not abused its monopoly.
It said the main issue facing the UK was a lack of terminal and runway capacity, which had resulted from complex 
UK planning laws and an antiquated regulatory system, rather than BAA's structure.
'I fully understand why airlines like British Airways and Ryanair want to weaken BAA and achieve greater control 
over prices and investment at the airports they dominate,' BAA chief executive Stephen Nelson said.
'This should not be confused with acting in the passenger interest.'
OFT chief executive John Fingleton earlier said that the current structure of the market for airport services does not 
deliver best value for air travellers in the UK and that greater competition within the industry could bring significant 
benefits for passengers.
He also said there is evidence of 'poor quality and high charges'.
'These are signs of a market not working well for consumers and we believe that a full inquiry into BAA's structure is 
justified,' Fingleton said in a statement.
Budget airline easyJet PLC in response said it would welcome a detailed investigation by the competition watchdog, 
but chief executive Andrew Harrison also noted it was 'not the biggest issue' at hand.
He said OFT needed to examine whether 'all the BAA's London airports are local monopolies which need much 
more stringent price regulation.'
'Changing the ownership of BAA will not alter this fundamental structural problem,' he said in a statement.
Ryanair Holdings PLC welcomed the decision by the OFT and called on the Competition Commission to 
recommend the break-up of what it called 'the BAA monopoly'.

LONDON (AFX) - The decision by the UK Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to refer airports operator BAA to the 
Competition Commission could prompt BAA, recently acquired by Grupo Ferrovial SA, to sell some of its assets, 
possibly Stansted, analysts said.
'The OFT's referral leaves a door open for a possible break-up of the London airports,' Merrill Lynch said in a note.
Given the high level of market demand for these assets, this could lead to significant sale proceeds, the broker said.
Douglas McNeill, transport analyst at Corporate Synergy, said he believed BAA may offer to sell one or more of its 
airports in an attempt to stave off action by the commission.
McNeill said BAA is not likely to encounter any problems in finding buyers, given the current vibrant interest among 
investors in infrastructure assets.
In a statement this morning, OFT chief executive John Fingleton said the current market structure does not deliver 
best value for air travellers in the UK, adding that greater competition within the industry could bring significant 
benefits for passengers.
He said there is evidence of poor quality and high charges. However, he left the door open for BAA to offer 
undertakings that would avoid a referral to the commission, saying the OFT will take account before a referral of 
any proposals that the company might put forward to address competition concerns.
In its defence, BAA said it believed its structure had benefited both passengers and airlines and that the company 
had not abused its monopoly.
It said the main issue facing the UK was a lack of terminal and runway capacity, which had resulted from complex 
UK planning laws and an antiquated regulatory system, rather than BAA's structure.
McNeill said BAA would need to sell at least one of its London airports to satisfy the regulator, adding that Stansted 
was a likely candidate since it would leave BAA with Gatwick and Heathrow, where British Airways is the company's 
biggest customer.
According to Royal Bank of Scotland, the possibility of a referral by OFT had been well flagged.
FOCUS BAA could sell airport assets to ward off OFT referral - analysts
'We believe the potential outcomes of the process could include disposal of one of Stansted and Gatwick airports 
and disposal of one of Edinburgh and Glasgow airports.'
The broker said a disposal would not present too much of a problem for Ferrovial since the airports are probably 
worth more separately than they are together.
Analysts said that if referral went ahead, the Competition Commission could take as long as two years to carry out a 
full investigation and make a decision.
Budget airline easyJet PLC in response said it would welcome a detailed investigation by the competition watchdog, 
but chief executive Andrew Harrison also noted it was 'not the biggest issue' at hand.
He said the OFT needed to examine whether 'all the BAA's London airports are local monopolies which need much 
more stringent price regulation.'
'Changing the ownership of BAA will not alter this fundamental structural problem,' he said in a statement.
Ryanair Hldgs PLC welcomed the decision by the OFT and called on the Competition Commission to recommend 
the break-up of what it called 'the BAA monopoly'.

STOCKWATCH easyJet lower as November traffic figures prompt profit

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in easyJet were modestly lower in late morning trade after its November traffic figures -- 
which showed a rise in passenger numbers -- prompted some profit taking, dealers said.
The no-frills airline said the number of people travelling on its flights climbed 11.2 pct last month.
The Luton-based group said it carried 2,554,143 passengers during November against 2,297,895 in the same 
month a year before.
Its load factor - how full its aircraft were - lifted by 0.4 percentage points to 80.5 pct.
In reaction, UBS said that it believes much of easyJet's share price
performance next year will be dictated through stronger revenue rather than on the cost side.
It said with rolling 12 month revenue still above 20 pct last year it looks like the revenue picture is still intact.
UBS maintained a 'neutral' rating and 600 pence target.
Separately, Oriel Securities said that it presumes that ancillary revenue will be the main driver of easyJet's average 
revenue trends, and it sees nothing to contradict its investment case on this front.
It said the doubling of Air Passenger Duty from Feb 2007 is unhelpful, especially since it coincides with the weakest 
part of the year, but should not have a dramatically adverse effect.
It thought the recent strong performance of the shares has seen the valuation gap to Ryanair close, as anticipated.
At 11.10 am, shares in easyJet were 4-3/4 pence lower at 604-1/4.

LONDON (AFX) - UK blue chips drifted lower in early afternoon trade following a dull and uneventful pre-budget 
report from Gordon Brown with the focus back on the outlook for Wall Street, seen opening lower, dealers said.
At 1.54 pm, the FTSE 100 index was 7.7 points weaker at 6,078.7, easing off an earlier low of 6,073.49, having 
reversed from a midmorning peak of 6,105.7.
The broader FTSE indices, however, all remained firmer.
Volume was fair, with 1.496 bln shares changing hands in 240,898 deals.
With the pre-budget report out of the way, traders looked back across the pond for fresh direction.
US stock futures are pointing to a lower open after a two-session run of gains that has the DJIA flirting again with 
record highs, with Yahoo set to be the early focus after the internet company announced a major reorganisation.
According to spread betting firm IG Index, the DJIA is seen opening around 9 points lower at 12,323 after adding 47 
points yesterday to end at 12,331.60, just 11 points shy of its record close of 12,342.60 on Nov 17.
Yesterday US stocks ended higher as encouraging wage inflation data and a report showing the nation's services 
sector in solid health raised hopes the US economy can slow without falling into recession.
In London, there was little real reaction to Gordon Brown's pronouncements this afternoon, with most of the 
measures unveiled by the Chancellor having already been predicted in the press.
British Airways was easier, off 2-1/4 pence at 501, but discount airlines easyJet and Ryanair both firmed -- up 3 
pence at 606 and 0.05 eur at 9.60 respectively -- as news of a doubling in airline passenger duty had been trailed in 
the weekend press.
Housebuilders failed to show much reaction to the Chancellor's news of plans to increase homes construction on 
'brownfield' sites, with the move also well flagged.
Blue chip housebuilder Persimmon remained higher, up 48 pence to 1,528 continuing to be boosted by bullish 
broker comment today.

Merrill Lynch raised its price target for Persimmon to 1,600 pence today ahead of an impending trading update from 
the firm, which the broker expects to be upbeat, and repeated its 'buy' advice.
The main thrust of Gordon Brown's statement was directed towards a major hike in schools and education 
spending, including plans for free books for children.
Educational publishers such as Pearson and Reed Elsevier failed to benefit from this initiative, however, with the 
blue chip shares down 7-1/2 pence at 746-1/2 and 6 pence at 565 respectively.
The only real beneficiary appeared to educational IT small cap, RM which saw its shares advance 4-1/2 pence to 
182 on the government investment moves.
Oil majors were mixed as news of a 1.25 pence a litre hike in fuel duty from midnight tonight was balanced by a 
firmer crude price - Royal Dutch shares were up a penny at 1,826, but BP slipped 0-1/2 pence lower to 577-1/2.
Oil prices edged higher today ahead of US inventory data expected to show a decline in stocks of distillates amid 
colder temperatures, and amid concerns the OPEC cartel will cut output again when it meets next week.
Away from the pre-budget report, a fall back by heavyweight mining issues provided the main drag on blue chip 
sentiment early afternoon, with the sector knocked back by declines in commodity prices - Vedanta was the worst 
performer, down 33 pence at 1,307, albeit after going ex-dividend today, while Kazakhmys lost 121 pence at 1,196, 
and BHP Billiton shed 13 pence at 967.
But on the upside, Royal Bank of Scotland shares continued to lead the FTSE 100 risers, up 61 pence at 1,901 -- a 
jump of 3 pct in value -- following a pleasing trading update today.
In its final statement of 2006, the UK's second-biggest bank said its pretax profit for the year is set to come in 
'slightly ahead' of the current consensus analyst forecast of 9.158 bln stg. In 2005, RBoS had a pretax profit of 8.25 
bln stg.
Brokers applauded the statement, with JP Morgan reiterating its 'overweight' recommendation and saying the group 
remains its top pick in the UK.
'Probably as good a trading statement as could be hoped for,' the broker told clients.
Dresdner Kleinwort was also bullish, repeating its 'buy' advice and raising its target to 2,300 pence from 2,275, 
saying the statement 'reassures on the fundamentals.'
The good news helped sentiment across the bank -- which was also lifted by a positive sector review from Goldman 
Sachs -- with HBOS shares up 17 pence at 1,054 and Barclays adding 5 pence at 682.
Goldman Sachs increased its target prices on domestic UK banks today as it rolled forward its 2007 earnings 
estimates to 2008.

LONDON (AFX) - UK blue chips drifted lower in early afternoon trade following a dull and uneventful pre-budget 
report from Gordon Brown with the focus back on the outlook for Wall Street, seen opening lower, dealers said.
At 1.54 pm, the FTSE 100 index was 7.7 points weaker at 6,078.7, easing off an earlier low of 6,073.49, having 
reversed from a midmorning peak of 6,105.7.
The broader FTSE indices, however, all remained firmer.
Volume was fair, with 1.496 bln shares changing hands in 240,898 deals.
With the pre-budget report out of the way, traders looked back across the pond for fresh direction.
US stock futures are pointing to a lower open after a two-session run of gains that has the DJIA flirting again with 
record highs, with Yahoo set to be the early focus after the internet company announced a major reorganisation.
According to spread betting firm IG Index, the DJIA is seen opening around 9 points lower at 12,323 after adding 47 
points yesterday to end at 12,331.60, just 11 points shy of its record close of 12,342.60 on Nov 17.
Yesterday US stocks ended higher as encouraging wage inflation data and a report showing the nation's services 
sector in solid health raised hopes the US economy can slow without falling into recession.
In London, there was little real reaction to Gordon Brown's pronouncements this afternoon, with most of the 
measures unveiled by the Chancellor having already been predicted in the press.
British Airways was easier, off 2-1/4 pence at 501, but discount airlines easyJet and Ryanair both firmed -- up 3 
pence at 606 and 0.05 eur at 9.60 respectively -- as news of a doubling in airline passenger duty had been trailed in 
the weekend press.
Housebuilders failed to show much reaction to the Chancellor's news of plans to increase homes construction on 
'brownfield' sites, with the move also well flagged.
Blue chip housebuilder Persimmon remained higher, up 48 pence to 1,528 continuing to be boosted by bullish 
broker comment today.

The commission launches first-phase inquiries into all deals that meet EU merger thresholds. These 
inquiries last one month, but are extended by two weeks when companies offer remedies or when a national 
competition authority asks to rule on the deal. A deal that is not expected to raise competition concerns 
may be submitted as a candidate for the EU's simplified merger procedure, a reduced regulatory process. 
The commission is entitled to transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.

LONDON (AFX) - An error by Ryanair was the root cause for one of its aircraft only 'marginally' avoiding a crash, 
The Times newspaper reported, citing an official report on the incident.
The aircraft, a Boeing 737 carrying 144 passengers and crew, was flying from London's Gatwick airport to Knock, in 
the west of Ireland, on March 23.
According to the report, it emerged from a low cloud just 400 feet above the ground, triggering an alarm and forcing 
the captain to ascend immediately.
The investigators concluded that the pilots failed to respond quickly enough to changing circumstances, but they 
said in their report that the root cause of the problem lay with Ryanair's failure to give its pilots the correct 
information.
The airline was also criticised for only reporting the incident two weeks after it happened, by which point some of 
the evidence on devices in the cockpit had been over-written.
According to The Times, Ryanair has accepted the safety recommendations made by the investigators.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading European shares are seen opening flat to higher as gains on Wall Street overnight may 
be overshadowed by the rally in the price of crude ahead of this week's OPEC meeting and with corporate news 
relatively thin on the ground, dealers said.
Last night, the DJIA rose 89.70 points, or 0.74 percent, to 12,283.80, while the Nasdaq Composite index added 
35.18 points at 2,448.39 as M&A activity offset Pfizer's decision to halt development of a key drug
In Asia this morning, the mood was mixed as Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index closed down 37.83 points at 16,265.76 amid 
profit-taking around the 16,400-point level, dealers said, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng was 166.95 points firmer at 
18,869.68 by midday.
Oil prices were firmer as the market awaited the outcome of an OPEC meeting next week.
Earlier this morning, the New York's Mercantile Exchange's main contract, light sweet crude for January delivery, 
was up 0.16 usd at 62.60 a barrel. Brent North Sea crude for January added 0.13 usd at 63.58 a barrel.
Back in Europe, Tesco is expected to report another strong trading update with UBS forecasting UK sales growth 
(excluding petrol) on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of new and closed space, of 6.0 pct.
They estimate international sales growth of 19.4 pct at constant currency or 3.4 pct like-for-like.
Philips Electronics' analysts meeting is expected to include comments regarding changes to corporate and 
marketing strategies for 2007.
And Swiss Life Holding expects a total gross premium of 21.5 bln sfr for the 2006 financial year and is on track to 
achieve its goals for 2008, chief executive Rolf Doerig said.
As previously said, Swiss Life targets include a 1 bln sfr net profit and a return on equity of over 10 pct.
In a press release accompanying today's investors' day, Doerig said that over the last few years, Swiss Life has 
become a focused European life insurer with an attractive portfolio and that it expects to continue to expand.
Euroshares outlook Flat to higher on Wall St; oil rallies ahead of OPEC meeting
Zurich Financial Services Group said it plans to create a shared services operating unit for its Farmers, North 
America Commercial and other North American units.
The new unit, to be called ZFUS Services, is expected to create savings in areas such as procurement, human 
resources, real estate and others worth an estimated 300 mln usd over the period 2007-2010, with additional 
annual improvements after that, Zurich Financial said.
The airline sector will also likely attract some attention as British Airways and Ryanair are both scheduled to issue 
traffic statistics today.
In other news, TF1 said it has acquired a 33.5 pct stake in TV broadcaster Groupe AB for 230 mln eur in a move 
aimed at reinforcing its programming and rights business.
Luxottica Group SpA said it has signed a licence agreement with jeweller Tiffany & Co for the design, 
manufacturing, and distribution of ophthalmic and sun collections under the Tiffany brand.
The Tiffany-branded collections are expected to be launched for early 2007 and generate after an initial launch 
period at least 50 mln eur of revenues per year, the Italian eyewear maker said in a statement.
On the economic front, the Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index is expected to fall to 55.8 in 
November after October's 57.1 reading.
Labor productivity in the third quarter is expected to have risen 0.2 pct, compared with the earlier estimate that 
productivity was unchanged in the three months from July to September. Unit labor costs are seen rising 3.5 pct, 
slightly slower than the 3.8 pct gain previously estimated. 'The real story about unit labor costs came last week with 
the (the Commerce Department's) compensation revisions (as part of its GDP report),' said Thomson IFR Market's 
Jeoff Hall.
Factory orders are seen falling 4.6 pct in October after having risen 2.1 pct in September. Excluding goods in the 
volatile transportation sector, factory orders are seen rising 1.3 pct after rising 0.2 pct in the prior month.

OUTLOOK Vueling to test its wings amid flurry of sector consolidation talk

MADRID (AFX) - Catalan no frills carrier Vueling Airlines is set to make its market debut today, becoming Spain's 
second listed representative in a sector currently embroiled in Europe-wide consolidation speculation, analysts said.
Yesterday, Vueling set the final price for its initial public offering of 42.62 pct of capital at 30 eur per share, towards 
the high end of the 24-32 eur indicative range, and valuing the company at around 450 mln eur.
According to stock market sources, the offer has been eight times subscribed by domestic and overseas 
institutional investors.
Banesto Bolsa analysts said Vueling's debut price implies a PE ratio of 18.5 on estimated earnings for 2007, 'a 
discount of 24 pct and 23 pct compared with EasyJet and Ryanair respectively...This could be described as as fair 
discount.'
'I think there will be some good demand for Vueling shares tomorrow...The offer was not very large and was not 
offered to retail investors, who will be anxious to get a slice of the cake,' a leading European investment banker 
said.
'Apart from all the M&A speculation gripping the sector at present, the low cost carrier segment is also a very 
attractive investment option given the growth prospects,' he noted.
Analysts have highlighted Vueling's rapid growth over two-and-a-half years since its founding, as well as its 
ambitious expansion plans, which include increasing its fleet to 37 planes by 2008 from 16 at the end of 2006.
The company expects to swing to a net profit of 24.2 mln eur in 2007 from a net loss of 7.1 mln expected in 2006.
Revenues are seen nearly doubling in 2007 to 427.2 mln eur from 237.8 mln.
But concerns have arisen over the ability of the company to maintain current growth rates given the heightening 
competition in the domestic low cost segment.
This is particularly true of Vueling's home turf in Barcelona, where Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA's low cost 
affiliate Clickair began operations out of El Prat airport on Oct 1.
Vueling is also facing stiff competition in its Madrid hub from EasyJet and RyanAir.
OUTLOOK Vueling to test its wings amid flurry of sector consolidation talk
The tough operating environment was highlighted in today's Expansion newspaper by Iberia Financial Director 
Enrique Dupuy, who suggested that Vueling could find the going difficult in the coming months.
He expressed the view that Clickair will have an advantage over Vueling in Barcelona, where it is effectively taking 
over from the Spanish flag carrier and will be operating with a code-sharing agreement.
Dupuy did not also rule out that Clickair could consider making a takeover bid for Vueling, knocking out the 
competition.
Fortis Bank analysts were sceptical, however, noting that Iberia could have made such a move before creating 
Clickair.

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Commission said the deadline for its inquiry into low-cost carrier Ryanair's 
proposed acquisition of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus has been extended to Dec 20.
The original deadline was Dec 6.
The commission extends inquiries by 10 working days in cases where a national competition authority has asked 
for jurisdiction or where the companies have offered remedies to competition concerns raised during the 
investigation.
Ryanair Holdings said on Oct 23 it had posted the offer document outlining its 1.48 bln eur hostile bid for Aer 
Lingus.
Ryanair holds a 25.2 pct stake in the flag carrier. It is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it management 
control.
Opponents of the bid already hold some 46.6 pct -- the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 
12.6 pct, the Irish government with 25.4 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind employees/pilots group with 
4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct.

BRUSSELS (AFX) - The European Commission said the deadline for its inquiry into low-cost carrier Ryanair's 
proposed acquisition of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus has been extended to Dec 20.
The original deadline was Dec 6.
The commission extends inquiries by 10 working days in cases where a national competition authority has asked 
for jurisdiction or where the companies have offered remedies to competition concerns raised during the 
investigation.
Ryanair Holdings said on Oct 23 it had posted the offer document outlining its 1.48 bln eur hostile bid for Aer 
Lingus.
Ryanair holds a 25.2 pct stake in the flag carrier. It is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it management 
control.
Opponents of the bid already hold some 46.6 pct -- the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 
12.6 pct, the Irish government with 25.4 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind employees/pilots group with 
4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct.

MADRID (AFX) - Catalan no frills carrier Vueling Airlines is set to make its market debut tomorrow, becoming 
Spain's second listed representative in a sector currently embroiled in Europe-wide consolidation speculation, 
analysts said.
Yesterday, Vueling set the final price for its initial public offering of 42.62 pct of capital at 30 eur per share, towards 
the high end of the 24-32 eur indicative range, and valuing the company at around 450 mln eur.
According to stock market sources, the offer has been eight times subscribed by domestic and overseas 
institutional investors.
Banesto Bolsa analysts said Vueling's debut price implies a PE ratio of 18.5 on estimated earnings for 2007, 'a 
discount of 24 pct and 23 pct compared with EasyJet and Ryanair respectively...This could be described as as fair 
discount.'
'I think there will be some good demand for Vueling shares tomorrow...The offer was not very large and was not 
offered to retail investors, who will be anxious to get a slice of the cake,' a leading European investment banker 
said.
'Apart from all the M&A speculation gripping the sector at present, the low cost carrier segment is also a very 
attractive investment option given the growth prospects,' he noted.
Analysts have highlighted Vueling's rapid growth over two-and-a-half years since its founding, as well as its 
ambitious expansion plans, which include increasing its fleet to 37 planes by 2008 from 16 at the end of 2006.
The company expects to swing to a net profit of 24.2 mln eur in 2007 from a net loss of 7.1 mln expected in 2006.
Revenues are seen nearly doubling in 2007 to 427.2 mln eur from 237.8 mln.
But concerns have arisen over the ability of the company to maintain current growth rates given the heightening 
competition in the domestic low cost segment.
This is particularly true of Vueling's home turf in Barcelona, where Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA's low cost 
affiliate Clickair began operations out of El Prat airport on Oct 1.
Vueling is also facing stiff competition in its Madrid hub from EasyJet and RyanAir.
OUTLOOK Vueling to test its wings amid flurry of sector consolidation talk
The tough operating environment was highlighted in today's Expansion newspaper by Iberia Financial Director 
Enrique Dupuy, who suggested that Vueling could find the going difficult in the coming months.
He expressed the view that Clickair will have an advantage over Vueling in Barcelona, where it is effectively taking 
over from the Spanish flag carrier and will be operating with a code-sharing agreement.
Dupuy did not also rule out that Clickair could consider making a takeover bid for Vueling, knocking out the 
competition.
Fortis Bank analysts were sceptical, however, noting that Iberia could have made such a move before creating 
Clickair.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has raised its stake in hostile bid target 
Aer Lingus Group PLC to 25.2 pct.
A disclosure to the stock exchange confirmed that Coinside Ltd, Ryanair's vehicle, yesterday purchased a further 
31.8 mln shares at prices ranging from 2.72-2.75 eur. It now holds 133.4 mln Aer Lingus shares.
Analysts reckon the purchase will be interpreted as underlining Ryanair's determination to eventually take over Aer 
Lingus even if, as is expected, its current bid fails.
Ryanair launched its 2.80 eur a share, 1.48 bln eur, hostile bid on Oct 5. However, analysts believe it has no 
chance of success and the airline has stated it will not raise its offer.
Ryanair is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it management control.
However, opponents of the bid already hold some 46.6 pct -- the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(ESOT) with 12.6 pct, the Irish government with 25.4 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic nigh 
on impossible for Ryanair.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in EasyJet have been upgraded to 'buy' from 'hold' by Deutsche Bank in a review of the 
low-cost carrier market, dealers said.
In a note to clients this morning, Deutsche Bank said the market seems to be signalling that preferring flag carriers 
over low-cost carriers may be starting to look 'a little long in the tooth' as an investment theme.
The broker said that growth in capacity in the 'narrow body' planes sector in Europe - the only way that large 
increments of new seat capacity can enter the market - should be peaking next year and fall below replacement 
levels by late 2008 or 2009.
Deutsche Bank noted that as the top three low-cost carriers are controlling capacity introduction, they should be 
able to stabilise yields.
In addition, the broker expects the 2010 air travel market to be 'large.' with a total number of journeys on air travel in 
and around Europe of about 976 mln per annum.
Regarding EasyJet, Deutsche Bank said the group's returns-focused strategy and disciplined capacity growth could 
yield further upgrades to consensus.
Air Berlin remains the broker's preferred pick, the only stock where it sees strong fundamentals and an attractive 
valuation.
Meanwhile, Ryanair remained a 'sell', with Deutsche Bank noting that while 'a rising tide helps all boats,' cost 
control still remains an issue.

Consolidation among tour operators 'absolutely necessary' - MyTravel shareholder
Consolidation among tour operators 'absolutely necessary' - MyTravel

LONDON (Thomson IM) - More consolidation among tour operators is 'absolutely necessary' given the 'fragile' 
economics of the business, according to Standard Life Investments, one of the largest shareholders in MyTravel 
Group PLC.
MyTravel Group today confirmed press speculation that it has made an approach and is now in talks with First 
Choice Holidays PLC regarding the possible acquisition of First Choice's mainstream business and some related 
operations.
In comments which appeared to indicate support for a tie-up, SLI's investment director Euan Stirling told the Today 
Programme: 'What the business needs is supply discipline, it needs a lot of flexibility in the way it can change its 
offering to consumers.
'And we've seen a bit of consolidation in the past few years but really there needs to be more and I think that's 
really the driver behind the moves.'
He believes mainstream package holiday businesses must combine 'so that they can compete more effectively with 
the likes of easyJet and Ryanair who have changed the landscape for people wanting to book holidays in recent 
years.'
SLI has a stake of about 10.5 pct in MyTravel. According to Thomson Financial data, it is the second largest 
shareholder behind Legal and General Investment Management.
Highlighting the demanding business environment in the sector, Stirling pointed to the 'difficult trading period' for 
both businesses and in particular MyTravel which had to issue a profit warning in the summer.
'Now, a couple of the factors that were at play here were the World Cup which changed booking patterns and also a 
hot summer in the UK, but I think that goes some way to telling you about the fragility of the economics of this 
business and that tells me that consolidation is absolutely necessary in this industry,' he said.
Earlier today, the MyTravel board said the deal could deliver significant value to both First Choice and MyTravel 
shareholders, given the value of potential synergies and other consolidation benefits.
Any offer by MyTravel would be in cash, financed through a mixture of new debt and equity.

MADRID (AFX) - Shares in Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA were lower in early deals on brisk profit-taking, on 
concerns that the airline's visibility will be further limited by new competition, amid doubts of any near-term 
consolidation prospects, dealers said.
At 12.25 pm, Iberia was off 0.07 eur or 2.61 pct at 2.61, off a low of 2.60, on volume of about 8.4 mln shares.
The IBEX-35 index fell 172 points to 13,915.0.
The increasing competition over recent months from low cost carriers Vueling Airlines, Ryanair and EasyJet -- all 
with new hubs in Iberia's Madrid home base -- is seen significantly cutting Iberia's domestic passengers, analysts 
said.
Vueling makes it market debut this Friday, after launching a initial public offering of 42.6 pct of the company. In its 
IPO prospectus, the company said it expects revenues to nearly double to 427.2 mln eur in 2007 from the 237.8 
mln forecast for this year.
Today's press carried a report that Iberia's low-cost affiliate Clickair is speeding up strategic targets deadlines to 
more quickly compete with the rush of newcomers.
'While Iberia's LatAm traffic is safe for now, domestic and EU routes could see significant passenger losses and/or 
yield contractions,' Deutsche Bank analysts said.
'Selling at a premium to the sector combined with limited visibility and still frosty union relations, the stock is at best 
a weak 'hold' on pure fundamentals,' the German bank said in a note to clients.
It noted, however, that it is increasing its price target for the Spanish flag carrier to 2.40 eur per share from 2.05, 
citing recent oil price declines and industry consolidation prospects as 'probably keeping the shares at elevated 
levels in the short-term.'
But other analysts have played down renewed speculation of a tie-up between Iberia and British Airways, in the 
wake of of merger talks between Air France and Alitalia SpA.
BA has a 10 pct stake in its Spanish peer.
STOCKWATCH Iberia lower on visibility concerns, consolidation prospects slim
'I don't think Iberia will be bought soon,' said an analyst at a leading European bank.
'We see Iberia and British Airways as some day getting together, but not anytime soon... not while there's the Open 
Skies agreement,' he added.

authority asks to rule on the deal. A deal that is not expected to raise competition concerns may be submitted as a 
candidate for the EU's simplified merger procedure, a reduced regulatory process. The commission is entitled to 
transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.
IN-DEPTH SECOND PHASE INVESTIGATIONS
Dec 20 -Proposed acquisition by Metso Corp of Aker Kvaerner ASA's pulping and power business
Jan 23 -Proposed acquisition by Candover's Thule AB of Schneeketten Beteiligung
Feb 6 -Proposed acquisition by Glatfelter PH Co of Crompton Ltd's assets
The commission opens in-depth probes lasting up to four months if competition concerns cannot be resolved 
during the first-phase inquiry.

LONDON (AFX) - Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC said the Irish Takeover Panel has ruled that 2007 
EBITDAR estimates plus the imputed multiple referred to in a recent circular constituted a profit forecast under Irish 
takeover rules.
The circular relates to its defence against a hostile takeover bid from Ryanair Holdings PLC.
Aer Lingus said it was not its intention that this reference be regarded as a profit forecast and it has been 
withdrawn.
The intention was to illustrate that the offer made by Ryanair values Aer Lingus at a significant discount to Ryanair 
and Aer Lingus' European peer group, Aer Lingus said.
Separately, the Irish Takeover Panel has ruled that Aer Lingus must publish details of its Process Improvement 
Programme, part of its takeover defence, by Dec 1.
The panel said the recent Aer Lingus response circular contained the claim that 'we are continuing to drive unit cost 
efficiencies and will write to you with details of our 2007 Process Improvement Programme in due course.'

MADRID (AFX) - Shares in Grupo Ferrovial SA were higher in midday trade, on news that the builder's Swissport 
unit has won a new handling services contract and amid talk that Dufry AG could be interested in its BAA unit's 
World Duty Free division, dealers said.
At 11.58 am, Grupo Ferrovial rose 1.10 eur to 77.75, on volume of about 156,500 shares.
The IBEX-35 index gained 76.4 points to 14,303.2.
In a morning note to investors, BPI analysts said Swissport's new contract to provide handling services for Ryanair 
at the Madrid airport beginning in February 2007 is 'positive.'
'Swissport has been expanding its handling platform into the Asian markets, namely to China, Japan and India and 
has recently been awarded six licenses to operate in Spanish airports,' BPI analysts highlighted.
'Swissport is expected to account for 23 pct of Ferrovial's services division revenues in 2006...services represent 25 
pct of Ferrovial's (ex-BAA),' they added.
Separately, BPI highlighted speculation that Dufry could be eyeing BAA's World Duty Free unit.
According to a local press report, Ferrovial could sell BAA's World Duty Free as it continues the process of 
divesting non-strategic assets.
'We believe this is positive not only because it would improve the equity IRR (internal rate of return) of Ferrovial's 
investment with a possible dividend payment anticipation but also because it would allow ADI (the Ferrovial-led 
consortium that acquired BAA) to redeem the more expensive loan tranches,' BPI said.
Ferrovial's ongoing divestments could also favour the regulatory issues at London regulated airports, with the price 
cap on airport charges being softened, it noted.

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Considerably more newly laid-off workers signed up for unemployment benefits last week, 
although the figures suggest the job market remains stable even as a housing slump afflicts the economy.
The Labor Department reported that new applications filed for the work week ending Nov. 18, rose by a seasonally 
adjusted 12,000 to 321,000.
Separately, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index moved to 92.1 in November from a 92.3 
preliminary reading and October's figure of 93.6, according to media reports. The index had been expected in at 93.
    BRUSSELS (AFX) - Euro group president Jean-Claude Juncker welcomed the upturn in euro zone growth and 
the decline in inflation. But Juncker, who is Luxembourg premier and finance minister, warned that growth 
and inflation divergences between member states could put the bloc's cohesion at risk if they continue.
    On risks to the recovery, he warned that global imbalances persist. The yuan 'has a deplorable 
tendency to follow the dollar', but said China's partners are making some progress in persuading it to 
revalue the currency. And oil remains the other key external risk to growth, despite the recent easing in 
prices, he said. 
PARIS (AFX) - French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin will meet with Finance Minister Thierry Breton tonight, 
notably to discuss the new delay to the planned merger of state-controlled Gaz de France with Suez, Villepin's

in particular the GDF/Suez merger project and support for the automobile sector,' a spokesman said.
GDF was ordered by the court yesterday to provide further information on the merger to its works council, which will 
push back the merger until January at the earliest.

    Deutsche Bank AG, Commerzbank AG, Goldman Sachs and WestLB AG are all also expected to become part of 
the pool, the Handelsblatt newspaper said.
MADRID (AFX) - Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA is targeting up to 25 pct of Citic International Financial 
Holdings (CIFH) in the future, the Basque bank's management said.
Earlier, BBVA said it had acquired a dual stake in China's Citic Group, comprising 5 pct of Citic Bank and 15 pct of 
CIFH for a total of 989 mln eur.
    ZURICH (AFX) - Givaudan AG said it has signed an agreement with Imperial Chemical Industries PLC to

group said.
    The planemaker also sees passenger revenue kilometres growing by an average of 4.8 pct per year over 
the period.
LONDON (AFX) - The UK Financial Services Authority has fined Berkshire Hathaway Inc's General Reinsurance 
UK Ltd (GenRe UK) 1.225 mln stg for arranging two improper reinsurance transactions.
The FSA said Gen Re UK, a subsidiary of General Re which merged with Warren Buffett's company in 1998, did 
not conduct its business with 'due skill, care and diligence'. It added that it did not organise or control its affairs 
responsibly and effectively.
    LONDON (AFX) - Vincent Bollore has vowed to continue fighting for boardroom representation at Aegis 
Group PLC, the UK media buying and advertising group in which the French entrepreneur holds a 29.2 pct 
stake. 
    Speaking after an extraordinary general meeting in London this morning, Bollore said he would not be 
deterred by the failure of a second attempt to install two of his nominees onto the Aegis board. 
WIESBADEN, Germany (AFX) - Linde AG said it has signed a definitive agreement to sell part of its bulk business

of investors to rescue the troubled airline.

year.

eur, below most forecasts and well below the consensus of around 1.4 bln, amid growth in all main businesses but 
revealing the extent of the slowdown in French banking activity growth.
It hopes to develop in Turkey as part of its goal for expanding outside its core French market, Finance Director 
Gilles De Margerie said at a press conference following the bank's release of third quarter earnings.
    LONDON (AFX) - Aer Lingus Group PLC staff holding 12.6 pct of the Irish airline have rejected a 
takover approach from budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, the SIPTU union said.
    The vote comes after Europe's largest budget airline yesterday said it would not increase its 2.80-
eur-per share offer.

although the figures suggest the job market remains stable even as a housing slump afflicts the economy.
The Labor Department reported that new applications filed for the work week ending Nov. 18, rose by a seasonally 
adjusted 12,000 to 321,000.
Separately, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index moved to 92.1 in November from a 92.3 
preliminary reading and October's figure of 93.6, according to media reports. The index had been expected in at 93.
    BRUSSELS (AFX) - Euro group president Jean-Claude Juncker welcomed the upturn in euro zone growth and 
the decline in inflation. But Juncker, who is Luxembourg premier and finance minister, warned that growth 
and inflation divergences between member states could put the bloc's cohesion at risk if they continue.
    On risks to the recovery, he warned that global imbalances persist. The yuan 'has a deplorable 
tendency to follow the dollar', but said China's partners are making some progress in persuading it to 
revalue the currency. And oil remains the other key external risk to growth, despite the recent easing in 
prices, he said.

The commission is entitled to transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.

EU merger reviews at a glance outlook
The commission launches first-phase inquiries into all deals that meet EU merger thresholds. These 
inquiries last one month, but are extended by two weeks when companies offer remedies or when a national 
competition authority asks to rule on the deal. A deal that is not expected to raise competition concerns 
may be submitted as a candidate for the EU's simplified merger procedure, a reduced regulatory process. 
The commission is entitled to transform a simplified inquiry into a full first-phase inquiry.
IN-DEPTH SECOND PHASE INVESTIGATIONS
Dec 20 -Proposed acquisition by Metso Corp of Aker Kvaerner ASA's pulping and power business
Jan 23 -Proposed acquisition by Candover's Thule AB of Schneeketten Beteiligung
Feb 6 -Proposed acquisition by Glatfelter PH Co of Crompton Ltd's assets
The commission opens in-depth probes lasting up to four months if competition concerns cannot be resolved during 
the first-phase inquiry.

LONDON (AFX) - Aer Lingus Group PLC staff holding 12.6 pct of the Irish airline have rejected a takover approach 
from budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, the SIPTU union said.
The vote comes after Europe's largest budget airline yesterday said it would not increase its 2.80-eur-per share 
offer.
Analysts reckon Ryanair's offer has little chance of succeeding.
Some 97 pct of the Employee Shareholder Ownership Trust (ESOT) voted against the Ryanair bid, SIPTU said.
'This is a ringing endorsement of the Union's call for the bid to be
overwhelmingly rejected,' SIPTU National Industrial Secretary, Michael Halpenny said in a statement.
'The bid by Ryanair held nothing for the workers, the consumers or the
airline and its defeat is a rejection not only of Ryanair's employment
practices but is a victory for common sense and consumer choice,' he
said.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, said it will not raise its 2.80 eur a share 
hostile offer for Aer Lingus Group PLC, the Irish flag carrier.
'In our opinion, there is nothing in the Aer Lingus defence document or its strategy as articulated by the chief 
executive that justifies a price in excess of 2.80 eur,' Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said in a letter to 
shareholders.
'Accordingly, Ryanair confirms that it will not increase its offer of 2.80 eur per Aer Lingus share.'
Analysts reckon the 1.48 bln eur offer has little or no chance of success.
Last week Ryanair extended the offer to Dec 4 after garnering only a tiny level of acceptances at the first closing 
date.
The airline has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid already hold some 46.6 pct -- the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(ESOT) with 12.6 pct, the Irish government with 25.4 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic 
difficult for Ryanair.
On Nov 6 O'Leary said it was most likely ESOT members would reject the offer, making it almost impossible for the 
bid to succeed.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, said it has extended its 1.48 bln eur 
hostile offer for Aer Lingus Group PLC to Dec 4 after garnering only a tiny level of acceptances at the first closing 
date.
As of yesterday acceptances for the 2.80 eur a share bid totalled just 504,994 Aer Lingus shares or less than 0.1 
pct.
Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid already hold some 46.6 pct -- the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(ESOT) with 12.6 pct, the Irish government with 25.4 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic 
difficult for Ryanair.
On Nov 6 Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said it was most likely ESOT members would reject the offer, 
making it hard for the bid to succeed.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, said it has extended its 1.48 bln eur 
hostile offer for Aer Lingus Group PLC to Dec 4 after garnering only a tiny level of acceptances at the first closing 
date.
As of yesterday acceptances for the 2.80 eur a share bid totalled just 504,994 Aer Lingus shares or less than 0.1 
pct.
Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid already hold some 46.6 pct -- the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust 
(ESOT) with 12.6 pct, the Irish government with 25.4 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic 
difficult for Ryanair.
On Nov 6 Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said it was most likely ESOT members would reject the offer, 
making it hard for the bid to succeed.

Ryanair rapped by Irish Takeover Panel over Aer Lingus bid statement

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has been rapped by the Irish Takeover 
Panel for breaching the regulator's rules in a statement made relating to the 1.48 bln eur hostile takeover bid for Aer 
Lingus Group PLC.
Ryanair had claimed in an Oct 20 statement its 2.80 eur a share bid for Aer Lingus was worth an average of over 
60,000 eur to each member of the Irish flag carrier's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT), which holds a 12.6 
pct stake.
'While some of the assumptions underpinning the figures in the statement are set out in the announcement, the 
panel decided that sufficient detail on the
assumptions underpinning the figures in the statement was not disclosed,' the panel said.
'Consequently, Aer Lingus shareholders were provided with insufficient detail to enable them to assess the 
significance of this statement. As such, the statement did not satisfy the standards of completeness required.'
Aer Lingus reckons Ryanair's offer is worth an average of 38,864 eur to employee members of ESOT and an 
average of 13,915 eur to ex-employee members.
Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid hold already some 46.6 pct -- a figure made up of ESOT's holding as well as the 
Irish government with 25.4 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and 
telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic difficult for Ryanair.
On Monday, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said it was most likely ESOT members would reject the 
offer, making it hard for the bid to succeed.

LONDON (AFX) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has been sanctioned by the UK's 
advertising watchdog over a TV ad promoting 4 mln 'zero fare' flights that actually cost passengers up to 21.70 stg.
Upholding a complaint from rival Monarch Airlines, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said Ryanair had 
breached its code by not making clear that passengers would have to pay taxes and charges in a range of 11.70 
stg to 21.70 stg, dependent upon their point of departure.
The ASA ordered the ad not to appear in its present form again.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Easyjet deflated in midmorning deals, as lower capacity, traffic and load factor numbers 
offset 'in-line' full year revenues, dealers said.
At 9.31 am, shares in the airline group lost 4-1/4 pence to 543-1/2, while the FTSE 250 index added 20.4 points to 
10,515.8.
This morning, the no-frills airline said the number of people flying on its services in October rose 7.3 pct against the 
same month the previous year to 2,935,355.
However, the Luton-based carrier said its load factor -- how full its aircraft were -- during the month dropped 2.4 
percentage points to 83.2 pct.
Reacting to the update, Citigroup reiterated its 'hold' stance on the stock, saying that while 12-months revenues 
were 'in-line' with its estimates, capacity, traffic and load factor were 'below forecasts'.
The broker noted that UK pricing was 'a little soft', while the rest of Europe was 'strong' and added that the strong 
revenue from peer Ryanair unveiled yesterday 'bodes well' for EasyJet.

LONDON (AFX) - Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, stands to collect at least 10 mln eur 
should the low-cost carrier decide to go ahead with plans to return some of its cashpile to investors, the Financial 
Times reported.
The newspaper said O'Leary, who holds a 5 pct stake in the Dublin-based airline, yesterday said Ryanair was 
looking into a number of options for returning 'a couple of hundred million euros' to shareholders by the end of 
2007. These include an annual dividend policy, a share buy-back programme, or a one-off special dividend.
A dividend pay-out would be a first for Ryanair shareholders.

INTERVIEW Ryanair 's Millar says 'all to play for' in Aer Lingus bid
INTERVIEW Ryanair's Millar says 'all to play for' in Aer Lingus bid

LONDON (AFX) - Howard Millar, deputy chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC reckons there is still 'all to play 
for' in its 1.48 bln eur hostile bid for Aer Lingus Group PLC despite the arithmetic appearing difficult for Europe's 
largest no-frills airline.
Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in the Irish flag carrier and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid hold already some 46.6 pct -- the Irish government with 25.4 pct, the Aer Lingus 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 12.6 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and Irish telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct.
Ryanair has claimed ESOT members will receive 60,000 eur each if they accept the 2.80 eur a share offer, while 
Aer Lingus reckons the offer is worth just 32,500 eur.
Speaking in an interview with AFX News, Millar said Ryanair is still hopeful ESOT members will end up backing the 
bid.
'We always knew that it was probably going to come down to the ESOT, the government weren't going to be 
sellers,' he said.
'If they [ESOT members] vote in favour the bid will go through, if they don't vote in favour, most likely it won't go 
through.'
Last Friday Dermot Mannion, Aer Lingus' chief executive, said he did not think Ryanair had a chance of getting the 
ESOT's support, telling AFX News: 'ESOT is already preparing for a ballot, which will be concluded by Nov 30, and 
that ballot will overwhelmingly reject the Ryanair bid.'
However, Millar claimed he is hearing a different story from the shop floor.
'On the ground at Dublin airport there's quite a different tone to things, we've had people turning up saying 'where 
do I sell my shares, where do I get the 60,000 euros,'' he said.
INTERVIEW Ryanair 's Millar says 'all to play for' in Aer Lingus bid
'There's a lot of people out there (ESOT members) who would be on relatively low wages -- baggage handlers, 
cleaners. Somebody turns up and says its 40 or 50 or 60 grand to you, cash, in your back pocket -- it's very hard to 
turn down.'
'This maybe has another couple of twists and turns in it, this will run pretty much to Christmas.'
Ryanair plans to remain a significant minority shareholder in Aer Lingus if its offer is not accepted by a majority of 
shareholders.
'If we're unsuccessful we can bide our time and make another bid in a year's time,' said Millar.
He said Ryanair wouldn't push for a seat on Aer Lingus' board, reckoning the airline would resist this at all costs.
'I think the chances of us getting a seat on the board are as high as Red Rum winning another Grand National. I 
think they would rather commit hari-kari than have Michael O'Leary (Ryanair's CEO) turn up at a board meeting.'
Millar was speaking after Ryanair published better-than-expected first half results.
At 9.39 am shares in Ryanair were up 0.24 eur, or nearly 3 pct, at 9.2 eur, valuing the business at 7.1 bln eur.

OUTLOOK Ryanair 's bid for Aer Lingus to overshadow Q2 results

LONDON (AFX) - Second quarter results today from Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest no-frills airline, look 
set to be overshadowed by its 1.48 bln stg hostile bid for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group PLC.
Ryanair launched the surprise 2.80 eur a share offer on Oct 5, just eight days after Aer Lingus' initial public offering 
valued the airline at 1.16 bln eur. The bid was immediately rejected by Aer Lingus' board as 'unsolicited and wholly 
opportunistic'.
Ryanair has amassed a 19.2 pct stake in Aer Lingus and is targeting the 50.1 pct holding that will give it 
management control.
However, opponents of the bid hold already some 46.6 pct -- the Irish government with 25.4 pct, the Aer Lingus 
Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) with 12.6 pct, Aer Lingus pilots with 2.3 pct, the Tailwind 
employees/pilots group with 4.2 pct, and telecoms tycoon Denis O'Brien with 2.1 pct -- making the arithmetic 
difficult for Ryanair.
The two airlines have engaged in a war of words since the bid was launched.
Aer Lingus has written to the Irish takeover panel accusing Ryanair of 'serious misrepresentations' in its offer 
document.
Ryanair has claimed Aer Lingus ESOT members will receive 60,000 eur each if they accept the offer. Aer Lingus 
reckons the offer is worth just 32,500 eur.
As for the second quarter to end-September figures, Goodbody Stockbrokers is forecasting a profit before tax of 
207.2 mln eur, up from 172.0 mln eur last time, and a 21 pct rise in earnings per share to 26.8 cents, driven by a 21 
pct rise in passenger volumes, a 2.5 pct lift in average fares per passenger, an 8 pct increase in ancillary revenues 
per passenger and ongoing control of costs, excluding fuel.
Oddo Securities is forecasting a 24.2 pct rise in net profit to 214 mln eur and in EPS to 28 cents, despite a 32 pct 
rise in the fuel bill. It reckons Ryanair may again raise its earnings guidance.
On Sept 29 Ryanair raised its year to end-March 2007 net profit guidance to approximately 335 mln eur, a rise of 11 
pct on last year's 302 mln eur.
OUTLOOK Ryanair 's bid for Aer Lingus to overshadow Q2 results
But the airline said it remained cautious on the outlook for the winter. It forecast full year passenger growth of 22 pct 
to 42.5 mln passengers, second half load factors -- a measure of how full planes are -- down 2 pct on last year, and 
a 5 pct decline in yields (average fares).
Ryanair will benefit only to a limited extent from the recent sharp fall in oil prices as the group had already hedged 
90 pct of its needs at 73-74 usd a barrel.
The airline is aiming to double in size by 2012, when it is targeting annual passengers of 84 mln.

LONDON (AFX) - Shares in Ryanair Holdings PLC pushed higher in early deals after Europe's largest no-frills 
airline reported Q2 results at the top end of market expectations according to Panmure Gordon, although the broker 
retained its 'hold' stance on valuation grounds, dealers said.
At 8.38 am, Ryanair shares were 0.13 eur firmer at 9.13.
Earlier today, Ryanair, which last month launched a 1.48 bln eur hostile offer for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus Group 
PLC, reported a 39 pct increase in first-half profit after tax and raised its guidance for full-year earnings.
For the six months to Sept 30 the Dublin-based carrier made record profit after tax of 329 mln eur, up from 237 mln 
eur last time, giving earnings per share of 42.67 cents, up 38 pct.
Ryanair said it remains cautious about its second half due to substantial capacity expansion and higher oil prices.
However, it still raised its guidance for year to end-March 2007 net profit after tax. It now expects net profit after tax 
to rise 16 pct to 350 mln eur, up from previous guidance of 335 mln eur.
In an initial reaction, Panmure Gordon pointed out that while Ryanair's Q2 net income topped expectations, the 
airline's share price has performed strongly to date, hence its maintained 'hold' rating.

LONDON (AFX) - Leading shares are set for a cautious start to the week as Wall Street slipped below the key 
12,000 level on Friday and as investors stay cautious ahead of Thursday's rate decision, dealers said.
According to IG Index, the FTSE 100 is seen opening 1 point lower at around 6,147 points, having closed on Friday 
0.3 points lower at 6,149.3.
Meanwhile, Wall Street finished the week under pressure, as a spike in the price of oil and a mixed set of job data 
added to jitters over the health of the world's largest economy.
The Labor Department revealed the unemployment rate hit a five year low, but enthusiasm was tempered as non-
farm payrolls missed market forecasts.
The DJIA ended off 32.5 points at 11,986.04, the Nasdaq Comp fell 3.23 at 2,330.79 and The S&P 500 was off 3.04 
at 1,364.30.
Meanwhile, in Asia the Nikkei 225 index closed 14.74 points firmer at 16,364.76, while the Hang Seng was up 62.68 
at 18,812.37 by midday.
Still in Asia, oil prices eased, pulling back from a sharp jump late last week sparked by threats against oil 
installations in Nigeria.
Earlier this morning, New York's main contract, light sweet crude for December delivery, was down 35 cents to 
58.79 usd a barrel from 59.14 in late US trade Friday when the contract had jumped 1.26 usd.
Back in London, Thursday's rate decision will take centre stage with investors braced for the MPC to raise 
borrowing costs to a five-year high in a bid to counter above-target inflation.
All 35 economists polled by AFX News expect the Monetary Policy Committee to raise its key repo rate by a quarter 
point to 5.00 pct, its highest level since before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the US.
And data today is expected to confirm manufacturing production rose by 2.3 pct year-on-year in September, up 
from 1.5 in August -- its biggest jump in two years.
Turning to equities, a clutch of blue chip stocks including Marks & Spencer, Yell, Rentokil Initial, Standard Life, BT, 
and SABMiller are set to publish numbers later in the week.
London shares outlook - lower as Wall St slips below 12,000; rate hike eyed
But before then, this morning midcap electronics distributor Electrocomponents should report a slight improvement 
in interim adjusted pretax profits.
Seymour Pierce is looking for pretax profit before exceptionals and amortisation of 36.7 mln stg against 35.3 mln 
stg last time.
Meanwhile, Ryanair, which last month launched a 1.48 bln eur hostile offer for Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, reported 
a 39 pct increase in first half profit after tax and raised its guidance for full year earnings.
For the six months to Sept 30 the Dublin-based carrier made record profit after tax of 329 mln eur, up from 237 mln 
eur last time, giving earnings per share of 42.67 cents, up 38 pct.
Other companies penciled into publish results today include Immunodiagnostic Systems, Prodesse Investment and 
Amazing Holdings.
As always on Monday, investors will look to the weekend press for inspiration, with M&A yet again hogging the 
headlines.
The troubled gaming industry will again be in focus after Ladbrokes confirmed it has held talks to buy Web betting 
firm 888 for an estimated 470 mln stg, The Times said.
The development pits the firm against PartyGaming, which has also had discussions with 888.
According to the Mail on Sunday, if the deal goes ahead, it could mean Israeli brothers Avi and Aharon Shaked, 
who together own 51.2 pct of 888, will become the largest private investors in Ladbrokes, which is valued at about 
2.5 bln stg.
And Saturday's Financial Times claimed Ladbrokes is also in talk to buy some of BWIN's operations as online 
gaming consolidation gathers pace while other reports suggest PartyGaming is also eying some of the Austrian 
internet betting company.
And Whitbread could also garner attention after the Sunday Times said US property investor Starwood Capital has 
secretly acquired a stake of almost 3 pct in the leisure conglomerate.
The stakebuilding will fuel speculation the UK company is a bid target for the investment group.
Staying in M&A, Smith & Nephew is this week set to resume takeover talks with US rival Biomet, increasing the 
possibility of a sale of its 1 bln stg wound-care business, The Times reported.
The orthopaedic group was recently forced to admit having held early stage merger negotiations and its shares 
plummeted on the news due to fears about the amount of debt necessary to fund a deal.
In retail, Signet is understood to have rebuffed an indicative approach for its UK division from a consortium 
including Gerald Ratner.
The Saturday Times claimed the jeweller rejected a 350 mln stg expression of interest from the group thought to 
also include Royal Bank Of Scotland and a private equity firm.
Meanwhile, the Sunday Express reported that Ratner has teamed up with acquisitive Icelandic investor Baugur to 
push forward his 350 mln stg bid for Signet's UK outlets.
And The London Stock Exchange could be active after The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported the bourse operator is 
proposing an operational tie-up with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, including the cross-listing of exchange-traded 
funds.
According to the paper, a senior LSE official presented the plan during a visit to the TSE last month.
