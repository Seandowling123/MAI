Aer Lingus today said that there was never any realistic chance that Ryanair would have received permission from 
the EU to take over Aer Lingus.
It said it noted that Ryanair had said it has been told by the EU that its bid for Aer Lingus has been rejected but that 
the EU has not been in touch with it on any decision reached.
"As indicated in our statement of 20 June 2012 at the outset of the bid, there was significant uncertainty that the 
offer from Ryanair was ever capable of completion. Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus was prohibited in 
2007 on competition grounds. Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous 
Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes. The number of 
routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007," the Aer 
Lingus statement said.
"The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger in this instance than with the previous offers. Therefore, it 
was and remains Aer Lingus' position that the offer should never have been made." "As indicated on 6 February 
2013, in our preliminary results announcement, Aer Lingus delivered an excellent overall performance in 2012. 
During 2012, the Company increased operating profit, total revenue, passenger numbers, average yields, load 
factors and market share. Aer Lingus is well positioned for future growth and continues to implement its successful 
'value carrier' business model. We look forward to continuing to serve our customers and to providing choice for 
consumers in the markets we serve." Following Ryanair's announcement regarding the EC investigation, Aer Lingus 
said it looks forward to continuing to assist the UK Competition Commission (UKCC) in its ongoing investigation into 
the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding. On 15 June 2012, the Office of Fair Trading referred 
Ryanair's minority shareholding to the UKCC for review, concluding that "there is a realistic prospect that its stake 
has resulted or will result in a substantial lessening of competition." "Ryanair has on a number of occasions 
A Lingus: Ryanair had little hope anyway A Lingus On Bid
attempted to halt this separate UKCC investigation, including by means of its third hostile takeover offer. Aer Lingus 
now looks forward to the conclusion of the UKCC investigation. As indicated previously it is Aer Lingus' position that 
Ryanair, as our largest competitor should be required to divest its shareholding in Aer Lingus," Aer Lingus said.

According to Ryanair, the European Commission has told Ryanair it will reject the low-cost carrier's attempt to take 
over Aer Lingus.
Ryanair described the decision as unfair and political.
But European Commission said a final decision had not yet been taken.
Ryanair, which has indicated that this third bid for Aer Lingus would be its last, said it would launch an appeal in 
European courts against the decision by the Commission, which acts as the European Union's competition 
authority. "It appears clear from this morning's meeting that no matter what remedies Ryanair offered we were not 
going to get a fair hearing and were going to be prohibited regardless of competition rules," Ryanair spokesman 
Robin Kiely said in a statement following a meeting with Commission representatives. "This decision is clearly a 
political one to meet the narrow, vested interests of the Irish government and is not based on competition law," he 
said. The government, which has said it is against the merger, declined to comment, as did an Aer Lingus 
spokesman. Aer Lingus's shares were 5 percent lower at 1.27 euros by lunchtime, when Ryanair's shares were 
unchanged at 5.67 euros. Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, was told last month that it had one last chance 
to submit measures to ensure the proposed 694 million-euro merger did not reduce competition. Ryanair's latest 
offer to the Commission included ceding 43 routes to Flybe and hand to British Airways the routes Aer Lingus 
operates from London's Gatwick Airport. The Commission blocked Ryanair's first attempt to take over Aer Lingus in 
2007 and Ryanair dropped its second in 2009. "The Commission will take a decision in this case at the end of 
February or the beginning of March," said a spokesman for EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia, declining to 
comment further on the Ryanair statement.

Ryanair : EU Commission Plans To Block Ryanair 's Offer For Aer Lingus
Ryanair: EU Commission Plans To Block Ryanair's Offer For Aer Lingus

Body
(RTTNews) - Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said it was notified that the EU Commission 
intends to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L), despite the fact that Ryanair has met every 
competition concern raised in the EU's Statement of Objections and during the review process, including providing 
the EU - at its request - with irrevocable commitments from not one, but two, upfront buyers to eliminate all 
competitive overlaps between Ryanair and Aer Lingus. Ryanair said it plans to appeal any prohibition decision to 
the European Courts.
Ryanair stated that IAG has committed that they would take over divestments of Ryanair's and Aer Lingus' entire 
London-Gatwick operations, and Flybe has committed to take over 43 Aer Lingus UK and European routes.
Given that the EU Commission recently approved IAG's acquisition of BMI at London-Heathrow on the basis of 
three year commitments, the EU's claim that it could not be satisfied of IAG's and Flybe's commitments to these 
Irish routes after three years is another example of the EU holding Ryanair to a much higher standard than any 
other EU airline. Ryanair's remedies package is unprecedented.
In August 2012, Ryanair had said that it intends to re-bid for Aer Lingus if the European Commission clears its offer 
following its Phase II review.
In June 2012, Ryanair had said that it plans to make an all-cash offer of 1.30 euros per share for rival Aer Lingus 
Group, valuing that company at about 694 million euros or $879 million.
Ryanair had first tried to acquire Aer Lingus in late 2006, but that bid was blocked by the European Commission on 
antitrust grounds.

Ever watched an airline passenger trying to cram an impossibly large bag into overhead luggage space? It feels a 
lot like that as Ryanair, in its third effort to take over rival Aer Lingus, seeks antitrust solutions to the carriers' near 
90-per cent share of short-haul routes into and out of Ireland. The current plan is to give 43 routes to Flybe, and 
provide the British discount carrier with EUR100m to set up bases in Dublin and Cork. International Airlines Group, 
meanwhile, is lined up to take over Aer Lingus's Gatwick slots (or, if the Irish government ever permits, those at 
Heathrow). Formally, competition officials in Brussels have until March 6 to rule; in reality, an internal decision could 
be made this week.
For all the pushing and shoving, big problems persist. For a start, the business to be divested to Flybe isn't one. It is 
a collection of routes which needs to morph into a coherent unit. That would only happen months after any bid is 
completed, during which time Ryanair would run the show (presumably with regulators' oversight). Second, Flybe's 
capacity to compete with Ryanair long-term is questionable. Market capitalisation is £50m; net debt (as of 
September) similar; consensus forecasts are for a small net loss in the year to March. The gifted EUR100m, 
moreover, would not ultimately be ringfenced from group finances. Flybe also has (limited) scope to drop acquired 
Aer Lingus routes, which could put Ryanair in a monopoly position on some city pairs. Most bizarrely, the Aer 
Lingus brand could live on with Flybe and Ryanair both using it differently - not least, in the latter's case, to run Aer 
Lingus's Irish Heathrow routes in competition with its own existing Stansted ones.
Aer Lingus' shares, at EUR1.37 and on a 12 times forward multiple, now top Ryanair's earlier bid price. That partly 
reflects effective performance. The flag carrier should be allowed to continue delivering just that.

going to be a new series of Thunderbirds produced for UK channel ITV. Gerry Anderson's tales from Tracy Island 
are to be given a new--generation, CGI spin I could be opening a real can of worms here, but my aircraft choice 
would certainly be Thunderbird 2 [see Rex Features shot, above]: it will be interesting to see whether the new 
programme is true to its groundbreaking design for a strategic transport." On the Airline Business blog, Graham 
Dunn detected some unlikely language used during Ryanair's latest results briefing. Such events are usually 
"-dominated by a mix of steady profits news and a generous scattering of colourful jibes at rivals and regulators 
alike", wrote Dunn. "But this time two words took an unusually high profile - customer service."

Jim French, chief executive of British airline, Flybe, is in Dublin today to sell the deal announced last week with 
Ryanair to create a new carrier as part of a deal with Ryanair to satisfy regulatory concerns over Ryanair's last-ditch 
bid for Aer Lingus.
He has pledged to develop more flights between Ireland and the UK if the European Commission gives the go-
ahead.
Under the deal with Ryanair, the new carrier, Flybe Ireland, would receive E100 million and nine aircraft from 
Ryanair and commit to operating 43 routes for at least three years if Ryanair's Aer Lingus bid succeeds, he said.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, is making its third attempt to take over rival Aer Lingus and has been 
told by the European Commission it has one last chance to submit measures to prove the merger will not curb 
competition. Ryanair will also provide Flybe Ireland with forward sales cash and liabilities worth around E50 million. 
In return Flybe will pay Ryanair E1 million for the newly created airline. In addition to the Flybe deal, Ryanair will 
pass Aer Lingus's routes from London's Gatwick Airport to British Airways. Mr French said Flybe would like to bring 
more choice and flexibility to the Irish markets. Speaking on RTE's Morning Ireland, he said the airline wanted to 
develop a slightly different business model and "develop frequency particularly in some of the shorter routes into 
the UK". Mr French also said it was "disingenuous and unfair" to say that Flybe was bankrupt. He said when the 
company was floated two-and-a-half years ago no money was taken out by the shareholders - "that money was 
planned to be reinvested...to expand our business in Continental Europe". He added that the company has up to 35 
jets on order. "We said we'd use the money to pay down the deposit on those new jets. "So it's not burning money, 
it's using the money you've took from the market for that reason," he said.

Smurfit Kappa's stocks declined 23c to E10.85. Following an announcement by the Venezuelan government on 
Friday that it is devaluing the Bolivar by 32pc, Smurfit Kappa has today notified the market of the impact on its 
operations. Firstly, group net assets will be reduced by 6pc or E142m and cash balances in euro terms will decline 
by E29m (6pc of group cash balances). We estimate that the devaluation will impact Group EBITDA by 1-2pc in 
FY13, which is consistent with management comments that it will not be material. "The potential for such a 
devaluation was well flagged by management in the FY12 results last week and thus should not come as a great 
surprise to the market. We continue to favour Smurfit Kappa given its undemanding valuation and upside potential 
to forecasts from a favourable pricing cycle. We reiterate our BUY recommendation," said Goodbody's.

Ryanair may have to plug EUR 1 billion Aer Lingus pension hole

Ryanair may have to sort out combined deficits of more than EUR 1 billion in the pension funds of Aer Lingus pilots 
and other workers, the chief executive of British regional carrier Flybe has indicated.
If the European Commission next month gives permission for the EUR 694 million Aer Lingus takeover to proceed, 
Ryanair is contracted to construct a new standalone Irish based short-haul carrier and give it to British regional 
carrier Flybe with all previous liabilities and debts paid off, Jim French, the chief executive of Flybe told this 
newspaper.
Flybe would get 43 Aer Lingus short-haul routes and EUR 100 million to create Flybe Ireland, as part of a remedy 
package offered by Ryanair to the European Commission to ease competition concerns.
"Responsibility for the Aer Lingus pension deficits will remain with Ryanair for them to resolve as they need to 
resolve it, so it is not going to be transferred to Flybe Ireland," said French.
If Ryanair received competition clearance and launched a successful bid, it could control Aer Lingus by May, said 
French. "We would not take over Flybe Ireland until the end of October. There would be an interim period of 
ownership of the entire Aer Lingus business by Ryanair. Our understanding is that any restructuring or 
reorganisation would be done in that intervening period. Ryanair has a contract to deliver a business to us with a 
certain cost structure. Our job would be to ensure that it comes with adequate resources and expertise to run that 
business safely and securely."
There is a concern in trade unions that transfer of undertakings legislation, should Ryanair's bid succeed, would not 
include pension rights, said a source. One aviation analyst said Michael O'Leary would "relish the chance to tackle" 
the Aer Lingus pension hole.

Jim French is a rare beast. The Flybe chief executive is one of the few European airline chiefs who can claim he 
has turned the screw on Michael O'Leary. At least for now.
The Ryanair boss was far from happy with the concessions he found himself offering Flybe to entice it to become a 
key part of his strategy to take over Aer Lingus, said French. Expletives were used across the negotiating table, he 
added.
By his own account, French played hardball -- but, in reality, he almost certainly could not believe his luck when 
O'Leary phoned him months ago. O'Leary eventually offered a deal that could see the British regional airline 
handed 43 of Aer Lingus's 90 short-haul routes, as well as EUR 100 million in cash. If the deal goes through, it will 
expand Flybe by a third and make it a key player in Ireland.
But if Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller is to be believed, Flybe is a mere pawn in Michael O'Leary's 
game to take over Aer Lingus. Mueller was also less than complimentary about Flybe's financial capability to block 
an eventual Ryanair monopoly in the Irish market.
Mueller said Flybe had serious financial difficulties, pointing to a series of profit warnings and a restructuring that 
will see 300 staff axed.
"Christoph Mueller said some rather unnecessary and rash things about us during the week," said French, adding 
that it may be a sign that the Aer Lingus boss is worried.
French pointed out that Flybe made a profit in seven of the last nine years and its loss this year is 2.5 per cent of 
turnover, compared to the 15 per cent of turnover loss Aer Lingus posted three years ago.
"We chose to use our cash to pay off all debt and pension liability," he said. "Our pension is in surplus.
Flybe's Ryanair sweeteners are not to Mueller's taste
"It is very unfair for Mueller to effectively say: 'We're sitting here with this bloody great pension debt, but let's forget 
that exists and we'll compare apples with oranges'."  
Flybe's recent difficulties stemmed from unexpected weakness in the British economy, said French.
"Our financial performance wasn't what was expected. But is that different from anyone else? If our shareholders 
believed we had been in any way reckless with the money do you really think they would have allowed us to move 
forward on FlyBe Ireland? Of course not," he said.
The insurance policy for French and his shareholders is the EUR 100 million Ryanair would give Flybe Ireland to 
ensure its sustainability during what doubtless would prove a difficult transition period.
"Flybe Ireland would be a proud Irish company but we are realistic about how strong a brand Aer Lingus is in 
Ireland," said French.
Nevertheless, Ryanair has given him an undertaking that it will hand over the new airline with a cost structure that 
would deliver an annual profit before tax of EUR 20 million.
"If Ryanair cannot deliver that cost structure -- and we believe they can, given their history -- but if they can't, they 
will top up the original EUR 100 million payment by twice whatever the shortfall is. So we get full cost protection for 
two years as well as EUR 100 million in revenue protection," said French.
Of course, eventually the new Irish-based airline would have to face head-on its greatest challenge -- the full force 
of competition from an expanded Ryanair.
"Our costs will be higher than Ryanair's, we know that. But we know our costs are lower than Aer Lingus because of 
discussions we had some years back. We will be slightly more expensive than Ryanair but will offer a service that is 
different enough to mean price won't be a deterrent."  
French believes that Flybe Ireland can operate a higher frequency on key routes by using a mix of Flybe's own 
existing 88-seat Embraer aircraft and the at least nine 180-seat Aer Lingus Airbus A320s it would receive as part of 
the deal. He believes Dublin provides enormous opportunities as a hub in this regard.
He also sees opportunities for the wider Flybe group to develop the leisure market based on Aer Lingus's expertise 
to destinations such as the Canaries.
But French knows, too, that his best-laid plans lie in the hands of Europe's competition authorities. And there his 
powers of prediction fail him.

Gasping for Aer: O'Leary's obsession
Gasping for Aer: O'Leary's obsession

Michael O'Leary is now on his third attempt to buy Aer Lingus. He is willing to spend at least EUR 694 million on 
what he has previously dismissed as "a small, stand-alone regional airline". He then proposes handing some of its 
plum routes to British Airways and FlyBe, as well as EUR 100 million in cash.
But just why does the chief executive of Ryanair want Aer Lingus so badly?
**European expansion with extra frills?**
Michael O'Leary has spent two decades doing an exceptional job growing Ryanair as an ultra-low cost player. It 
now has about 12 per cent of the entire European aviation market. But Aer Lingus could give O'Leary a foothold in 
a new market.
He may want Aer Lingus as a secondary brand in his stable that is closer in feel to Easyjet -- a little fancier than 
Ryanair, serving the main airports in major cities and with greater appeal to the type of business customer who 
currently turns their nose up at his pared down offering.
"He may well have decided that he wants to take a chunk of that market using the Aer Lingus brand," said an 
aviation analyst.
"This would allow him to expand his overall market share in Europe by aiming at a different segment."
O'Leary may envisage long-term limits to Ryanair's low-cost expansion in Europe. He has long targeted 100 million 
passengers per annum for the airline, which currently carries close to 80 million annually. But O'Leary may see Aer 
Lingus, and its nine million passengers, as a good starting point for competing in a new segment and winning an 
even bigger piece of the wider European pie.
O'Leary is the proven master of low-cost expansion but, while he would be opening a Pandora's box of legacy 
carrier risk, the analyst believes he could equally lead an airline with more frills.
Gasping for Aer: O'Leary's obsession
"He could do it with his eyes closed,   the source said. "He would just be rolling out what Aer Lingus and Easyjet 
already do, but with an even lower cost base."
By buying Aer Lingus, O'Leary can benefit from its brand in Ireland and, more importantly, its slots, experience and 
infrastructure at airports such as Frankfurt, Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam.
**Coming to America?**
European expansion is fine on its own terms, but if it were the whole story, would O'Leary be happy to hand 43 Aer 
Lingus short-haul routes to FlyBe, as he has proposed?
Aviation observers have suggested that Ryanair could use Aer Lingus as a testing ground to see if it can stimulate 
transatlantic demand, by implementing a model that could cut the cost of flights by up to 30 per cent of the current 
offering from Aer Lingus.
If that worked, O'Leary could then implement the same model from other cities such as Manchester or Newcastle.
Ireland's expansion-ready airports and uncrowded airspace on the edge of Europe arguably make it the ideal 
location to establish a transatlantic hub, with access to US immigration and customs, and pre-clearance an added 
attraction. As in Europe, buying Aer Lingus would give O'Leary US slots, infrastructure and invaluable transatlantic 
expertise.
It would also provide him with, among other aircraft, an initial fleet of seven long-haul Airbus A330s, at least some 
of which are "unencumbered", said a source. The cost of buying such a fleet -- with new Airbus A330s likely to cost 
anywhere from EUR 100 million upwards -- could be worth the purchase price of Aer Lingus alone.
**Grudge match?**
When you talk to employees of Aer Lingus, many argue that O'Leary has long despised the airline, and is motivated 
to buy it and then wipe it from the aviation map.
Obviously, Ryanair has a board and shareholders who would be unlikely to support their chief executive on such a 
venture. However, even analysts believe that O'Leary's personality does play its part in the story, not least because 
he is such a dominant figure at Ryanair.
"Taking over Ireland [in aviation terms] would certainly appeal to [him]," said one aviation analyst and close 
observer of Ryanair.
"He is extremely competitive. He loves what he does and, in a way, he sees this all as a game and he wants to win.
"He is the driving force in this, and there are very few people who would question him.  
**Homeward bound?**
Apart from the obvious bragging rights, finally taking over Aer Lingus would also extend O'Leary's reach in his home 
market. Notwithstanding the Flybe deal, buying Aer Lingus would consolidate the Irish market, and hand a merged 
Ryanair/Aer Lingus more pricing power.
Perhaps more importantly, it would give the group massive bargaining power at Dublin Airport, where O'Leary has 
had an uneasy relationship at the best of times.
This could prove very useful in trying to drive down the costs of his potential transatlantic offering.

A bear raid left Cupid among the small-cap casualties this week.
The online dating specialist slumped 26.1 per cent after a post on an investment blog questioned its revenue 
reporting and highlighted transactions with companies owned by management.
Cupid responded that it was trading in line with expectations and knew of "no material reason" for the share price 
weakness.
Peel Hunt, the company's broker, said "We can find . . . nothing that concerns us."
Plethora Solutions, the developer of treatments for urological disorders, dropped 67.5 per cent after warning it was 
in urgent talks with third parties to meet its immediate working capital needs.
Oil explorer RusPetro fell 21 per cent after postponing a $350m bond issue that was required to meet a funding 
shortfall and repay debt owed to Sberbank. The bond was pulled pending an update from its Siberian field and an 
independent audit.
"We estimate a $75m equity raise would provide RusPetro with enough financial headroom to be comfortably 
funded through 2013," said RBC.
Flybe jumped 25.3 per cent after Ryanair provisionally agreed to transfer some routes and aircraft to its smaller 
rival, along with a dowry of EUR100m, in the hope of securing European Commission approval for its Aer Lingus 
bid.

By 12:45, the index had climbed 48.1 points to 3,578.11.
Irish packaging group Smurfit Kappa posted an 11pc rise in full-year pretax profit, buoyed by strong demand and 
increased exposure to high-growth markets such as Mexico. Shares in the group, which designs and manufactures 
paper-based packaging for the likes of Unilever and Procter and Gamble, were up 2.5pc at E10.30 euros, not far 
short of a five-year high of E10.64 set last week. Strong demand and a stable outlook also promoted Europe's 
leading containerboard and corrugated packaging producer to increase its final dividend 37 percent to 20.5 cents 
per share. Dublin-based Smurfit, formed through the 2005 merger of Jefferson Smurfit and Kappa Packaging, has 
for the last four years focused on paying down debt which stood at 2.79 billion euros at the end of 2012. The 
company, which last month successfully refinanced some of its debts with a 400 million euros note offering, said 
yearly pretax profit rose to 331 million euros (dollar 448 million), boosted by cost controls, on revenue which was 
flat at 7.34 billion. "This is our second largest result since 2007 and this performance reflects the benefit of our 
continuing focus on operating efficiency," Chief Financial Officer Ian Curley told reporters.
Shares in DCC jumped nearly 5pc or E1.16 each to E25.91. DCC may join a long list of top Irish corporates to 
abandon its listing on the Irish Stock Exchange for London, its interim management statement said this morning. It 
said that it is considering whether to seek a listing on the FTSE UK Index series, which would result in the 
cancellation of its listing in Dublin as its business increasingly shifts towards the UK. "Since its original stock 
exchange listing in Dublin and London in 1994, DCC has achieved significant growth in scale and in geographic 
footprint. For some time, the majority of the Group's revenue and operating profit has been generated in the UK 
with most of the Group's development activity and expenditure since 1994 taking place outside Ireland. In addition, 
DCC, Smurfit, Aer Lingus lift ISEQ; ISEQ Up
the profile of DCC's shareholder base has also changed significantly, with approximately 77pc of DCC's shares now 
held by institutional investors outside Ireland," the statement said. Aer Lingus shares rose to E1,30 this morning 
after a strong set of full year results, reaching Ryanair's bid price after Ryanair sought to do a deal with two UK 
rivals to strengthen its chances of winning EU approval for a takeover. Ryanair is seeking binding commitments 
from two rivals to compete with it as part of a last-ditch attempt to secure anti-monopoly approval for a takeover of 
Aer Lingus, a source close to the deal said. British Airways and Flybe have agreed in principle to increase their 
presence on the Irish market to allay concerns of the European Commission, Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog, but 
Ryanair is seeking a binding commitment approved by their respective boards, the source said. Ryanair stocks 
gained 4c to E5.59.

Aer Lingus shares rose to E1,30 this morning after a strong set of full year results, reaching Ryanair's bid price after 
Ryanair sought to do a deal with two UK rivals to strengthen its chances of winning EU approval for a takeover.
Ryanair is seeking binding commitments from two rivals to compete with it as part of a last-ditch attempt to secure 
anti-monopoly approval for a takeover of Aer Lingus, a source close to the deal said.
British Airways and Flybe have agreed in principle to increase their presence on the Irish market to allay concerns 
of the European Commission, Europe's anti-monopoly watchdog, but Ryanair is seeking a binding commitment 
approved by their respective boards, the source said.
The European Commission last week indicated that the package of concessions will be Ryanair's last chance to 
convince it of the merits of the Aer Lingus deal. British Airways management has agreed to take over Aer Lingus 
routes between Dublin and London's Gatwick Airport, the source said. Rival Flybe said in a statement that it had 
committed in principle to setting up an Irish subsidiary, with 100 million euros of capital provided by Ryanair, to take 
over Aer Lingus routes. Analysts say the concessions have raised the chance of approval by the European 
Commission, and Aer Lingus' share price has climbed from E1.10 at the start of January to reach the E1.30 euro 
bid price this morning. But concerns remain about the strength of Flybe, which has issued profit warnings in recent 
months and laid off 10 percent of its UK based staff. Some observers have also questioned the commercial logic for 
British Airways, which is based in Heathrow, of launching additional capacity from Gatwick. "If investors were 
putting on 10 percent probability, now they might be putting on a 30-40 percent probability," a Dublin-based trader 
said. Ryanair had offered to sell Aer Lingus' Heathrow routes to British Airways to allay concerns the merger would 
curb competition on routes between the United Kingdom and Ireland. But the fact that Aer Lingus requires the 
approval of over 75 percent of its shareholders to dispose of Heathrow slots raised concerns in the European 
Aer Lingus shares hit Ryanair bid price; AL Shares
Commission about the ability of the merged airline to sell the slots, the source said. The Irish government, which 
owns 25 percent of Aer Lingus, has said it opposes Ryanair's bid. Instead, British Airways will commit to take on 
Aer Lingus routes between Gatwick Airport and Dublin, with an option to take over the Heathrow routes if Ryanair 
ultimately secures over 75 percent, the source said. A spokesman for British Airways declined to comment. The 
new Flybe subsidiary would operate 43 routes that are currently worth around 20 million euros in profit to Aer 
Lingus each year, the source said. Ryanair would have no involvement with Flybe after the new venture's creation 
and will not guarantee its profits, the source said. Flybe, a low-cost regional airline group operating over 180 routes 
to 65 European airports, said in a statement that the deal was subject to EU commission approval.

The son of bankrupt businessman Sean Quinn has said he does not believe he is obliged to say what he has done 
with almost E400,000 paid to him over a year by companies in his family's international property group (IPG).
His wife was advised by lawyers that she was not required to say how she spent E320,297 paid to her, Sean Quinn 
jnr also told the Commercial Court.
Mr Quinn agreed he was general director finance of a Russian company, Logistika, and had sought and received 
details of multi-million cash balances of several IPG Russian companies in March 2012.
He had no clue about the whereabouts of rents or other monies paid to those as he dealt with tenant issues and 
other matters such as snow removal, not accounts, he said. "I do not have a clue where the money has gone and 
let me be struck dead as I leave this court if that's wrong," he said. The Irish Times XXXX Ryanair's latest package 
of remedies submitted over the weekend to the European Commission in relation to its E694 million offer for Aer 
Lingus is unprecedented in terms of aviation takeovers. It also clearly illustrates the strategic long-term value that 
Michael O'Leary places on acquiring Aer Lingus. Ryanair has offered to provide a E100 million, no-strings-attached, 
cash payment to UK regional carrier Flybe to capitalise a new business in Ireland that would take over 43 of Aer 
Lingus's 90 short-haul routes. Ryanair has also guaranteed Flybe that the piece of Aer Lingus that it takes over 
would come with a cost base that would result in a profit of E20 million a year. Ryanair has agreed to hand over the 
Gatwick-Ireland routes to British Airways rather than the Heathrow slots. The Irish Times XXXX Irish-based global 
online recruitment company Saongroup has bought the Chinese operation of recruiter Monster Worldwide. The New 
York-based Monster group will retain a 10pc shareholding in the combined Chinese business of Saongroup. 
Businessman Denis O' Brien holds a 75pc shareholding in Saongroup and its chairman Leslie Buckley holds the 
remaining 25pc. It already has a comprehensive national network of offices and websites in several Chinese cities. 
The addition of ChinaHR. com boosts the network to almost 200 cities across the Asian country. The terms of the

deal have not be disclosed. Ciaran McCooey, Saongroup group chief executive, told the Irish Independent that the

as the groups most likely to use cheques, despite the fact that this method of payment is expensive. The average 
consumer writes 19 cheques a year. Stamp duty of 50c, bank charges and the cost of postage mean that this 
method of payment costs almost E26 a year for the 19 cheques. A new survey from the Central Bank found that 
across the economy, we issue around 84 million cheques a year - second only to France in terms of intensive

The son of bankrupt businessman Sean Quinn has said he does not believe he is obliged to say what he has done 
with almost E400,000 paid to him over a year by companies in his family's international property group (IPG).
His wife was advised by lawyers that she was not required to say how she spent E320,297 paid to her, Sean Quinn 
jnr also told the Commercial Court.
Mr Quinn agreed he was general director finance of a Russian company, Logistika, and had sought and received 
details of multi-million cash balances of several IPG Russian companies in March 2012.
He had no clue about the whereabouts of rents or other monies paid to those as he dealt with tenant issues and 
other matters such as snow removal, not accounts, he said. "I do not have a clue where the money has gone and 
let me be struck dead as I leave this court if that's wrong," he said. The Irish Times XXXX Ryanair's latest package 
of remedies submitted over the weekend to the European Commission in relation to its E694 million offer for Aer 
Lingus is unprecedented in terms of aviation takeovers. It also clearly illustrates the strategic long-term value that 
Michael O'Leary places on acquiring Aer Lingus. Ryanair has offered to provide a E100 million, no-strings-attached, 
cash payment to UK regional carrier Flybe to capitalise a new business in Ireland that would take over 43 of Aer 
Lingus's 90 short-haul routes. Ryanair has also guaranteed Flybe that the piece of Aer Lingus that it takes over 
would come with a cost base that would result in a profit of E20 million a year. Ryanair has agreed to hand over the 
Gatwick-Ireland routes to British Airways rather than the Heathrow slots. The Irish Times XXXX Irish-based global 
online recruitment company Saongroup has bought the Chinese operation of recruiter Monster Worldwide. The New 
York-based Monster group will retain a 10pc shareholding in the combined Chinese business of Saongroup. 
Businessman Denis O' Brien holds a 75pc shareholding in Saongroup and its chairman Leslie Buckley holds the 
remaining 25pc. It already has a comprehensive national network of offices and websites in several Chinese cities. 
The addition of ChinaHR. com boosts the network to almost 200 cities across the Asian country. The terms of the

Ryanair in EUR100m route offer to Flybe

Ryanair has offered EUR100m to Flybe, the regional airline, to operate many of Aer Lingus' routes out of Ireland, in 
its latest effort to persuade the European Commission to approve its takeover of the Irish flag carrier .
Ryanair has also made a conditional offer to International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, to provide 
the UK flag carrier with a majority of Aer Lingus' valuable take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow airport, 
said two people familiar with the matter.
But Ryanair's attempt to take over Aer Lingus is far from certain of securing regulatory approval. Brussels blocked 
Ryanair's first bid in 2007, and since the latest offer was unveiled in June the European Commission has expressed 
concerns about the potentially negative impact on competition.
Flybe yesterday confirmed that Ryanair, Europe's largest budget carrier by revenue, had agreed in principle to 
contribute EUR100m in cash and about 10 aircraft to a new subsidiary of the regional airline, should the takeover of 
Aer Lingus gain regulatory clearance.
The subsidiary would operate about 40 per cent of Aer Lingus' short-haul routes for three years in an effort to 
ensure competition on flights in and out of Ireland. The deal would provide a substantial boost for Flybe, which 
reported a pre-tax loss of £6.2m in 2011/12 and has issued several profit warnings since its 2010 flotation.
Flybe said implementation of its agreement with Ryanair would be dependent, among other things, on the "outcome 
of the commission's deliberations on the competition aspects of Ryanair's bid".
Ryanair has improved a package of remedies to address the commission's concerns about competition.
Aer Lingus claimed last year that a merger between it and Ryanair would leave the combined company with a 
monopoly or dominant position on 44 routes out of Ireland.
Ryanair in EUR100m route offer to Flybe
To address these concerns under Ryanair's latest remedies package, Flybe would operate about 40 of Aer Lingus' 
100 short-haul routes.
Separately, British Airways would operate services between London's Gatwick airport and Dublin, Shannon and 
Cork for up to three years, said two people close to the situation. Ryanair, IAG and the commission declined to 
comment.
Ryanair's shares closed down 1.76 per cent at EUR5.52. IAG's shares were up 2 per cent at 215.10p, and Flybe's 
fell 2 per cent to 44.75p.

(RTTNews) - Flybe Group Plc (FLYB.L) Wednesday said it has come to terms with Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, 
RYA.L) regarding the possible transfer of aircrafts and operating routes as part of a package of remedies that 
Ryanair has submitted to the European Commission DG Competition, in the context of its bid for Aer Lingus Group.
The transaction is subject to EC's approval of Ryanair's proposed remedies and a successful bid by Ryanair for Aer 
Lingus.
Upon completion of Ryanair's acquisition of Aer Lingus, Flybe expects to seek formal shareholder approval for the 
acquisition of Flybe Ireland from Ryanair in early Autumn 2013. Flybe said it has received irrevocable acceptances 
representing 64 percent of the shareholders in support of the transaction.
The European Commission had insisted on the pledging of irrevocable acceptances by over 50 percent of Flybe's 
shareholders as a condition precedent for the deal to create Flybe Ireland proceeding.

RYANAIR has agreed the possibility of transferring some of its routes and aircraft to smaller operator Flybe in order 
to win the European Commission's approval for its Aer Lingus bid.
Flybe confirmed yesterday that Ryanair had agreed in principle to create a new company, into which business 
assets and cash of (EURO)100m (£86.2m) would be transferred and which Flybe would then acquire.
Ryanair is making its third takeover attempt of Aer Lingus and needs to make concessions to keep competition on

Ryanair has offered to give British airline Flybe E100 million in cash to help establish an operation in Ireland that 
could take over 43 routes from Aer Lingus as it seeks to gain approval from the European Commission to acquire 
its Irish rival.
The routes in question are expected to generate a profit of E20 million for Flybe, according to Ryanair's submission.
Ryanair has also withdrawn a proposal that British Airways would take over Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots.
Instead, BA has agreed to take over Ryanair and Aer Lingus Gatwick slots for flights to Dublin, Cork and 
Shannon.This is an important change to the remedies package submitted to the commission. Government veto At 
present, the Government, which owns 25.11 per cent of Aer Lingus, could veto a transfer of the Heathrow slots to 
British Airways if it were to gain the support of another 5 per cent of shareholders in the former state-owned airline.

market share fell 1pc to 27.6pc, but it's still the country's biggest grocery retailer. SuperValu's share slipped 0.5pc to 
19.8pc while Superquinn's fell 4.5pc to 5.3pc. Aldi's market share was 5.9pc. Lidl's was virtually unchanged at 
5.7pc. David Berry, commercial director at Kantar Worldpanel, said that shoppers responded well to Dunnes' 
promotional 'Shop and Save' offer, buying more items when they did shop and increasing the average size of their 
baskets by almost E3 to E36.70, a rise of 9pc. The Irish Independent

SCRAPPING air passenger duty (APD) would end up benefiting the public purse, according to research conducted 
by PwC and commissioned by airlines
If the government ended the controversial levy on air travellers entering or leaving the UK, the subsequent boost to 
businesses could lift GDP by 0.46 per cent this year, the study by PwC claimed yesterday
The rise in business activity would more than offset the amount raised by APD each year, leading to a net gain of 
£500m a year in the first two years for the exchequer, it adds
The Treasury expects to take £2.9bn in air passenger duty in 2012/13, rising to £3.9bn by 2017/18
PwC's report, which comes just over a month ahead of George Osborne's next Budget, was commissioned by four 
of the UK's biggest airlines
British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair and EasyJet put aside rivalries in 2011 to jointly lobby for the end of APD 
through their "Axe the Tax" campaign
The levy has long been a bugbear of the travel industry, and sparked a fresh wave of criticism when it rose by eight 
per cent last April
APD costs between £13 per passenger on a short-haul flight and £92 for long-haul journeys. "The government must 
urgently review the report's recommendations ahead of the upcoming Budget," said Mark Tanzer, chief executive of 
the Association of Britsh Travel Agents
Axe tax and lift growth, airlines urge Osborne
The four airlines said in a statement: "Should APD be abolished the aviation industry would be able to move quickly 
to add new flights in and out of the UK, or invest in new products and services, creating new opportunities for 
businesses and much needed jobs across the UK." The report claims that 60,000 jobs would be created if the tax 
gets the chop in the Budget

Highlight: Ryanair says it will appeal against the prohibition.
Body
The European Commission (EC) has prohibited Ryanair¯&s proposed takeover bid of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus. 
The decision was based on concerns over reduced choices and increased prises that are likely to follow the 
acquisition.
¯&The Commission concluded that the merger would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or a 
dominant position on 46 routes where, currently, Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete vigorously against each 
other,¯&says EC in a statement.
Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, pointing out that this is the first occasion on which the EC has needed to block 
the same deal twice. This is Ryanair¯&s third unsuccessful takeover bid of its Irish rival.
Ryanair has expressed intentions to appeal EC¯&s prohibition and has called the decision ¯&political¯&.
¯&The history of the EU¯&s treatment of Ryanair¯&s two offers for Aer Lingus conclusively proves that this 
prohibition is a ¯&political¯&decision to pander to the vested interests of the Irish Government (a minority 25% 
shareholder in Aer Lingus) and is not one that is based on a fair and reasonable application of EU competition rules 
or precedent airline merger approvals in Europe,¯&says Ryanair in a statement.
The low cost carrier also stressed on the ¯&historic and unprecedented remedies package¯&of its latest offer, 
which included two upfront buyers- BA and Flybe.

Irish budget carrier Ryanair has been ordered by Europe's top court to compensate passengers delayed by a 
volcanic ash cloud in Iceland in 2010, in a ruling that could expose other airlines to similar claims from disgruntled 
travellers. The court said EU rules require airlines to compensate travellers for delays caused by unforeseen 
events. Ryanair said the decision could "materially increase the cost of flying across Europe".

Body
The European Union's top court said Thursday that Irish low-cost airline Ryanair has to pay out compensation to 
passengers that were stranded due to the 2010 volcano eruption in Iceland.
The European Court of Justice ruled that airlines have an obligation to provide care, even in such "extraordinary 
circumstances" as the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano. The volcano's ash cloud was considered too 
dangerous to fly through and millions of passengers were left stranded after airplanes were grounded.
Ryanair said in a statement the ruling would make flying more expensive for consumers. It said the decision `'will 
materially increase the cost of flying across Europe and consumer airfares will increase as airlines will be obliged to 
recover the cost of these claims from their customers."
In 2011, Ryanair imposed a new (EURO)2 ($2.71) fee on all flight bookings to `'cover future compensation costs."
The company also said that volcano eruptions and subsequent closure of airports were `'clearly and 
unambiguously" events outside an airline's control.
`'The European Court now makes the airlines the insurer of last resort even when in the majority of cases ... these 
delays are entirely beyond an airline's control," the company said.
The court gave its opinion after a one Irish passenger was stranded in southern Portugal for a week during the 
crisis and demanded compensation from Ryanair of almost (EURO)1,130 ($1,530.13).
Ryanair has said it paid out (EURO)26.1 million ($35.4 million) to stranded passengers but it has refused many 
claims, citing their "excessive" cost.
Even though EU rules do not set financial limits on compensation, the court said passengers can only claim costs 
that proved `'necessary, appropriate and reasonable to make up for the shortcomings of the air carrier."
It left it to national courts to assess what that meant in their cases.
EU top court sides against Ryanair in volcano case
The case centers on Denise McDonagh of Ireland who was scheduled to fly back from Faro to Dublin April 17, 2010 
only to learn that the flight was canceled. She was stranded in the Algarve for a week before being able to return 
and charged the costs of meals, refreshments and accommodation.
EU rules say that airlines do not have to pay their passengers if the conditions are beyond extraordinary 
circumstances, but the court said the volcano eruption and subsequent chaos at European airports `'do not release 
air carriers for their obligation to provide care."
Chief executive Michael O'Leary has already called on the European Commission and the European Parliament to 
reform their laws on passengers' reimbursement rights, saying they discriminate against airlines since payouts for 
stranded passengers of ferry, rail and bus services are capped at the original ticket cost.

The ISEQ failed to make any real headway today, weighed down by weak economic news from the US and as 
Ryanair shares fell following an EU court ruling.
By 14:45, the index was up 3.77 points to 3,552.09.
Ryanair shares fell 6c to E5.53 after it was ordered by Europe's top court to compensate passengers delayed by a 
volcanic ash cloud in Iceland in a ruling that could expose other airlines to similar claims from disgruntled travellers. 
European airspace was shut down for six days when the Eyjafjallajokull volcano erupted in April 2010, affecting 
more than 10 million people and costing airlines dollar 1.7 billion. The Luxembourg-based European Union Court of 
Justice (ECJ) ruled today that EU rules required airlines to compensate travellers for delays caused by unforeseen 
events. "An air carrier must provide care to passengers whose flight has been cancelled due to extraordinary 
circumstances such as the closure of airspace following the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano," the court said.
Shares in Kerry Group climbed 20c to E38.82. Cranswick attained a 7pc volume growth in the three months to end 
December, with particularly strong growth in bacon, sausages and cooked meats. The company noted increasing 
input costs, especially UK pig prices but said these were offset by efficiency improvements and pricing. "Cranswick 
is a peer of Kerry Foods in the UK and the positive lfl sales growth there in sausages, where Kerry is market leader, 
is a positive indicator for the Irish company. Kerry has also highlighted the higher input costs (estimated by Kerry at 
+4pc) as an issue to be dealt with this year. In the beverage sector, C&C's recent IMS showed renewed growth in 
Ireland, while its UK cider sales continued to fall, albeit at a lower pace in its Q3," said Goodbody Stockbrokers.

Body
The European Union's top court has said that Ryanair has to pay out compensation to passengers that were 
stranded because the 2010 volcano eruption in Iceland.
The European Court of Justice said today that airlines face an obligation to provide care, even in such 
"extraordinary circumstances" as the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano.
The eruption left millions of passengers stranded because it was too dangerous to fly through the ash clouds.
The court gave its opinion after an Irish passenger was stranded in southern Portugal for a week during the crisis 
and demanded compensation of almost E1,130.
Ryanair has said it paid out E26.1m to stranded passengers but it has refused many claims, citing their "excessive" 
cost. The court said passengers can only claim "reasonable" costs. The ruling will affect all air carriers in the 
European Union.

Highlight: Ryanair Holdings plc has reported that profit attributable to equity holders of parent for the third quarter 
ended December 31, 2012 was E18.1 million, or 1.25 cents per share, compared to E14.9 million, or 1.02 cents per 
share, for the third quarter ended December 31, 2011. Ryanair expects full year profits to exceed its previous 
guidance of E490 million to E520 million and rise close to E540 million.
Body
Total operating revenues for the third quarter ended December 31, 2012 were E968.8 million, compared to E844.4 
million for the third quarter ended December 31, 2011. Profit attributable to equity holders of parent for the nine 
months ended December 31, 2012 was E613.7 million, or 42.45 cents per share, compared to E558.4 million, or 
37.73 cents per share, for the nine months ended December 31, 2011. Total operating revenues for the nine 
months ended December 31, 2012 were E4.07 billion, compared to E3.56 billion for the nine months ended 
December 31, 2011. Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said: "Our Q3 profit of E18 million was ahead of expectations 
due to strong pre-Christmas bookings at higher yields. The 8% rise in avg. fares reflects our improved customer 
service, record punctuality and the successful roll out of our reserved seating service. Our fuel costs rose E81 
million, (+24%), slightly less than expected as oil prices increased 22% (from pbl$84) to pbl$102. Excluding fuel, Q3 
unit costs rose 4% due to excessive increases in Italian ATC costs, Spanish airport charges, and the strength of 
Sterling to the Euro. Ancillary revenue performed strongly and rose 24% to approximately E13 per pax."

Ryanair posted a strong set of third-quarter figures yesterday on the back of a surge in pre-Christmas bookings.
An 8 per cent rise in average fares lifted the carrier's pretax profit to E18.1 million for the three months to December 
31st, up 21 per cent on the same period last year.
Revenues rose by 15 per cent to E969 million as traffic grew 3 per cent to 17.3 million passengers. The airline said 
bookings from passengers in the UK, Germany and Scandinavia were "particularly robust".
The airline's better-than-expected numbers helped it absorb an E81 million hike in its fuel bill, due to rising oil 
prices. The airline also raised its profit forecast to E540 million after tax for the year to March, which would 
represent a 7 per cent increase on last year. "We saw strong demand out of the UK, out of Germany and out of 
Scandinavia and that has gone straight to our bottom line," chief operating officer Michael Cawley said. "We are still 
struggling to understand it, to be honest." However, he acknowledged sales were not as buoyant in southern 
Europe, with Spain in particular "very weak" and fare growth in Italy flat. New aircraft Next year fares will continue to 
rise although capacity will likely only grow by 2-3 per cent in the financial year to March 2014, Mr Cawley said, 
down from the 4 per cent rise forecast in the current year, due to the lack of new aircraft deliveries. He said the 
airline remained in "protracted negotiations" with Boeing about a large order. Excluding fuel, unit costs rose 4 per 
cent in the quarter due to increases in Italian air traffic control costs, Spanish airport charges and the strength of 
sterling versus the euro, the airline said. Ryanair opened its 51st base in Maastricht in December and will open six

Change after strong Christmas demand
New submission to EU on Aer Lingus
Body
Ryanair increased its profits outlook for the full year after strong demand for flights in the run-up to Christmas 
boosted fares for Europe's largest low-cost carrier.
The airline, which is in the middle of trying to secure European approval for its takeover bid for Ireland's flag carrier, 
Aer Lingus, said it now expected full-year profits to come close to EUR540m, compared with its previous guidance 
of EUR490m to EUR520m.
It reported third-quarter net profit of EUR18m, up 21 per cent on last year. Revenues in the quarter rose 15 per cent 
to EUR969m, with passenger traffic up 3 per cent.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive , said average fares jumped 8 per cent in the quarter, because of "improved 
customer service, record punctuality and the successful rollout of our reserved seating service".
Ryanair shares closed down 2.8 per cent at EUR5.39.
Analysts at Investec said that Ryanair's trading had been "very impressive", arguing that the introduction of 
reserved seating on the low-cost airline appeared to have gone "extremely well", increasing ancillary revenues 24 
per cent year on year.
Separately yesterday, Ryanair said it had submitted a "radical and unprecedented" package of possible remedies to 
the EU regarding its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair increases profits outlook
The Financial Times reported this month that Ryanair had offered to sell about 40 per cent of Aer Lingus's short-
haul operations to Flybe, the UK regional airline, addressing concerns about 23 routes where the proposed merger 
would create a monopoly.
In addition, British Airways, part of International Airlines Group, would be given the right to buy about half of Aer 
Lingus's prized Heathrow slots, which are used for services to Dublin, Shannon and Cork.
Mr O'Leary is trying, for the third time in seven years, to combine the Irish airlines. Brussels blocked his first bid for 
Aer Lingus in 2006 and regulators have already rejected Ryanair's first two attempts to address competition 
concerns raised by the deal.
Ryanair said yesterday that it planned six new operations from April at Eindhoven, Krakow, Zadar, Chania, 
Marrakesh and Fez.
"Significant capacity cuts by legacy and other struggling EU carriers continue to offer us substantial growth 
opportunities across Europe," the company said.
EasyJet, Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier by revenues behind Ryanair, said this month that cuts to capacity 
by competitors had helped boost its firstquarter revenues.

Transocean jumped on news that activist investor Carl Icahn was poised to apply pressure on the owner and 
operator of the Deepwater Horizon.
Mr Icahn increased his stake to 5.6 per cent and called on the Swiss group to declare a minimum dividend of $4 per 
share. The shares rallied 4.2 per cent to SFr54.10.
"If Icahn gets his way, the dividend payment will amount to about $1.5 billion and will make a significant dent in 
Transocean's cash reserves," said Gavan Nolan, analyst at Markit.
Tobacco company Swedish Match received a fillip from Chevreux after analysts moved it from their outperform 
basket to their selected list. The shares climbed 3.4 per cent to SKr241.60
Investors reacted to negotiations over a shake-up of shareholder structure at EADS . Tom Enders, chief executive, 
sought to fend off political pressure over who would be the next chairperson at the weekend. The shares gained 2.7 
per cent to EUR35.74.
In Athens Greek regulators agreed to scrap a short-selling ban on shares, with the exception of banking stocks.
"I don't think lifting the ban will have any significant market impact at this point in the cycle," said Achilles Risvas, 
chief executive at Dromeus Capital, a hedge fund that aims to profit from a Greek recovery.
The Athens General index fell 0.1 per cent to 1,013.79.
Spain's Inditex lost ground as the owner of the Zara brand said it would cease employing subcontractors in 
Bangladesh after officials found clothes with its labels in the wreckage from a deadly factory fire in December.
The shares fell 2.1 per cent to EUR105.05.
Ryanair sent jitters through the airline sector after it said it had seen some weakness in fares in January.

However, chief executive Michael O'Leary said he expected fares to recover in over the next few months. The

RYANAIR chief executive Michael O'Leary said yesterday he thinks his airline's "radical and unprecedented" 
concessions will ensure success in its bid for Aer Lingus.
The budget airline, which expects to hear back from the EU competition authorities in March, has offered to sell 
parts of Aer Lingus' network to two buyers to help ease anti-trust concerns.
"We believe these remedies address every current Ryanair/Aer Lingus crossover route and all other competition 
issues raised by the Commission in its Statement of Objection," said O'Leary.
His bullish comments came as Ryanair posted a surprise profit before tax of (EURO)19.3m (£16.6m) for the three 
months to the end of December and raised its full-year profit forecast by around (EURO)30m to (EURO)540m.
Revenues rose 15 per cent to (EURO)968.8m, fuelled by a 24 per cent jump in ancillary revenues such as reserved 
seat fees and baggage charges to (EURO)220.1m.
The surge in turnover soaked up some of Ryanair's rising operating expenses, up 14.6 per cent to (EURO)934.2m. 
Most of this increase came from fuel and oil costs, which climbed 24 per cent to (EURO)414.8m.
Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said Ryanair "continues to produce the best returns in the industry".

Ryanair has never been known for reticence. Even so, it takes a certain bravado to boast in two directions at once, 
as the low-cost airline does in its update on the quarter to the end of December.
No sooner has it described itself as "Europe's only ultra-low cost carrier" than it notes the 8 per cent rise in average 
fares. Those higher fares contributed to a rise of 15 per cent in revenues to EUR969m. That, in turn, is the main 
factor in the company's guidance that the full-year profit outlook is rosier than expected.
The fare increases show how Ryanair is benefiting from cuts in capacity across the sector - whether voluntary, as 
groups (including Ryanair) decide to keep planes on the ground to protect load factors; or enforced as carriers 
restructure or close.
This easier operating environment, rather than Ryanair's efforts to buy Aer Lingus, is driving analyst optimism about 
the stock. The carrier insists its latest proposed remedies address all the competition concerns from the European 
Commission. But a deal that overcomes the objections without undermining the point of the takeover still looks like 
pie in the sky.

The ISEQ slipped back in to the red this morning as investors turned cautious and as Ryanair stocks dipped after its 
recent surge.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was down 15.32 points to 3,537.77.
Ryanair posted very strong Q3 results with Q3 net profit of E18.1m up 21pc year on year (yoy). Q3 revenues 
increased by 15pc to E968.8m driven by an 8pc increase in yields and a 3pc rise in passenger numbers. Ancillary 
revenues rose by 24pc due to the combination of an improved product mix, roll-out of reserved seating and higher 
internet- related revenues. Unit costs ex-fuel rose by 4pc due to Italian ATC costs, Spanish airport charges and the 
strength of sterling (likely impact of c.1pc, with closer to 2pc benefit on the yield front). Total unit costs were up 
11pc, driven by a fuel increase of 24pc, leading to operating margins down 1 point to 18pc. The primary driver for 
beating forecasts was improved revenue, helped by market capacity discipline, product (punctuality etc) and roll-out 
of reserved seating. Shares in the airline fell 6c to E5.4.
CRH shares fell 11c to E15.66. The American Institute of Architects (publishers of ABI) has released its latest bi-
annual review of consensus forecasts for the non-residential sector. It shows that the is expected to grow by 5.0pc 
in 2013, which is slightly down from the 6.2pc reported in July. This revision reflects lower forecasts for all of the key 
segments (commercial, industrial and institutional). Growth is expected to accelerate to 7.2pc in 2014. Overall the 
commentary from the AIA is generally of a positive tone towards the non-residential, especially given that the ABI 
has now been above the critical 50 level for five consecutive months. "These forecasts are consistent with the mid-
single digit growth in our models. For Wolseley the sector represents circa 44pc of its US business while it is 30pc 
for CRH. The key difference between the two companies is that CRH is more exposed to infrastructure where 
growth is expected to be subdued whereas Wolseley has greater exposure to the cyclical recovery in residential 
markets," said Goodbody's.

The ISEQ slipped back in to the red this morning as investors turned cautious and as Ryanair stocks dipped after its 
recent surge.
By 12:45, the ISEQ was down 15.32 points to 3,537.77.
Ryanair posted very strong Q3 results with Q3 net profit of E18.1m up 21pc year on year (yoy). Q3 revenues 
increased by 15pc to E968.8m driven by an 8pc increase in yields and a 3pc rise in passenger numbers. Ancillary 
revenues rose by 24pc due to the combination of an improved product mix, roll-out of reserved seating and higher 
internet- related revenues. Unit costs ex-fuel rose by 4pc due to Italian ATC costs, Spanish airport charges and the 
strength of sterling (likely impact of c.1pc, with closer to 2pc benefit on the yield front). Total unit costs were up 
11pc, driven by a fuel increase of 24pc, leading to operating margins down 1 point to 18pc. The primary driver for 
beating forecasts was improved revenue, helped by market capacity discipline, product (punctuality etc) and roll-out 
of reserved seating. Shares in the airline fell 6c to E5.4.
CRH shares fell 11c to E15.66. The American Institute of Architects (publishers of ABI) has released its latest bi-

Highlight: Ryanair increased its full-year profit forecast today on better than expected fare growth in Northern 
Europe, but Europe's top low-cost airline said
Body
Ryanair increased its full-year profit forecast today on better than expected fare growth in Northern Europe, but 
Europe's top low-cost airline said passenger numbers would rise modestly next year due to a lack of plane 
deliveries.
The Dublin-based airline hiked its profit forecast to 540 million euros (dollar 728 million) after tax in the year to 
March, up from an earlier estimate of between 490 million and 520 million.
It made a profit of 18 million euros in the traditionally weak three months to December thanks to a stellar 8 percent 
rise in average fares, way ahead of the 3 percent average forecast by three analysts polled by Reuters. Revenue 
was up 15 percent to 969 million euros.
"We saw strong demand out of the UK, out of Germany and out of Scandanavia and that has gone straight to our 
bottom line," Chief Operating Officer Michael Cawley told Reuters. "We are still struggling to understand it, to be 
honest." Average fares will grow at a slower pace in the three months to March, he said. Next year fares will 
continue to rise though capacity will likely only grow by 2-3 percent in the financial year to March 2014, he said, 
down from the 4 percent rise forecast in the current year, due to the lack of new plane deliveries planned. While 
many airlines have been hit hard by Europe's struggling economy and high fuel costs, Ryanair has fared better than 
most, thanks to its size and focus on low costs and low prices. Its chief low cost rival easyJet last week also posted 
strong results in the last quarter of the year, with revenue growth of 9.2 percent. Ryanair shares closed on Friday at 
5.50 euros, up 16 percent since the start of the year compared to a 5 percent increase in the broader Irish market. (

Ryanair hiked its full-year profit forecast today as strong demand in Northern Europe lifted average fares 
dramatically in the last three months of 2012.
Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's top low-cost airline, which has used its size and low costs to undercut struggling 
flag carriers, hiked its profit forecast to 540 million euros for the year to March, up from an earlier 490-520 million 
euro range.
"We saw strong demand out of the UK, out of Germany and out of Scandinavia and that has gone straight to our 
bottom line," Chief Operating Officer Michael Cawley told Reuters.
Strong demand in the run-up to Christmas and a high uptake of reserved seating options helped to lift ticket prices 
in northern Europe well above the company's forecasts, he said. Sales were not as buoyant in Southern Europe, 
with Spain in particular "very weak," and fare growth in Italy flat, he said. An 8 percent rise in average fares lifted 
the airline to a profit of 18 million euros in the traditionally weak three months to December, compared with an 
average forecast by five analysts polled by Reuters of a 5 million euro loss. Fare growth compared with 5 percent in 
the six months to September and was way ahead of the 3 percent average forecast by three analysts polled by 
Reuters. Average fares will grow at a slower pace in the three months to March, however, Cawley said. Ryanair has 
been able to sweep up customers as traditional rivals cut back capacity in the face of slow economic growth in 
Europe and high fuel costs. Revenues climbed 15 percent to 969 million euros in the quarter, better than the 9.2 
percent revenue growth its chief low cost rival easyJet reported last week. Ancillary revenues, which exclude ticket 
prices, were up 24 percent from a year earlier. "Demand is exceeding supply in the short-haul market and Ryanair 
is capitalising on it," said Davy stockbrokers analyst Stephen Furlong. "The market will be very happy with these 
numbers." Higher fares helped Ryanair absorb a 24 percent hike in fuel costs compared with the same quarter last 
year. Fuel cost inflation is expected to ease to 5 percent in the year to March 2014 from 14 percent in the current

financial year. Excluding fuel, unit costs rose 4 percent in the quarter due to increases in Italian air traffic control 
costs, Spanish airport charges and the strength of Sterling to the Euro, Ryanair said. Next year fares will continue to 
rise though capacity will likely only grow by 2-3 percent in the financial year to March 2014, Cawley said, down from 
the 4 percent rise forecast in the current year, due to the lack of new plane deliveries planned. The airline remains 
in "protracted negotiations" with Boeing about a large plane order, Cawley said. In a separate statement, Ryanair 
said it remained confident European Union antitrust regulators would approve its bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus by 
March. Ryanair's shares opened down 1 percent on Monday at 5.42, compared with a fall of 0.2 percent on the 
broader Irish market .

"We saw strong demand out of the UK, out of Germany and out of Scandinavia and that has gone straight to our 
bottom line," Chief Operating Officer Michael Cawley told Reuters.
Strong demand in the run-up to Christmas and a high uptake of reserved seating options helped to lift ticket prices 
in northern Europe well above the company's forecasts, he said. Sales were not as buoyant in Southern Europe, 
with Spain in particular "very weak," and fare growth in Italy flat, he said. An 8 percent rise in average fares lifted 
the airline to a profit of 18 million euros in the traditionally weak three months to December, compared with an 
average forecast by five analysts polled by Reuters of a 5 million euro loss. Fare growth compared with 5 percent in 
the six months to September and was way ahead of the 3 percent average forecast by three analysts polled by 
Reuters. Average fares will grow at a slower pace in the three months to March, however, Cawley said. Ryanair has 
been able to sweep up customers as traditional rivals cut back capacity in the face of slow economic growth in 
Europe and high fuel costs. Revenues climbed 15 percent to 969 million euros in the quarter, better than the 9.2 
percent revenue growth its chief low cost rival easyJet reported last week. Ancillary revenues, which exclude ticket 
prices, were up 24 percent from a year earlier. "Demand is exceeding supply in the short-haul market and Ryanair 
is capitalising on it," said Davy stockbrokers analyst Stephen Furlong. "The market will be very happy with these 
numbers." Higher fares helped Ryanair absorb a 24 percent hike in fuel costs compared with the same quarter last 
year. Fuel cost inflation is expected to ease to 5 percent in the year to March 2014 from 14 percent in the current 
Ryanair lifts profit forecast to E540m Ryanair Profit
financial year. Excluding fuel, unit costs rose 4 percent in the quarter due to increases in Italian air traffic control 
costs, Spanish airport charges and the strength of Sterling to the Euro, Ryanair said. Next year fares will continue to 
rise though capacity will likely only grow by 2-3 percent in the financial year to March 2014, Cawley said, down from 
the 4 percent rise forecast in the current year, due to the lack of new plane deliveries planned. The airline remains 
in "protracted negotiations" with Boeing about a large plane order, Cawley said. In a separate statement, Ryanair 
said it remained confident European Union antitrust regulators would approve its bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus by 
March. Ryanair's shares opened down 1 percent on Monday at 5.42, compared with a fall of 0.2 percent on the 
broader Irish market .

Ryanair chief, Michael O'Leary, this morning said that its offer for Aer Lingus is "a radical and unprecedented 
remedies package to the EU".
The EU's competition authorities are currently considering the E694m takeover bid and will deliver a verdict in 
March.
"We believe these remedies address every current RyanairAer Lingus crossover route and all other competition 
issues raised by the Commission in its Statement of Objections," Mr O'Leary said.
"The remedies involve two upfront buyers each basing aircraft in Ireland to takeover and operate a substantial part 
of Aer Lingus' existing route network and short-haul business. This will be the first EU airline merger which will 
deliver structural divestitures and multiple upfront buyers. We look forward to completing our offer for Aer Lingus

(RTTNews) - The major European markets are marginally lower in early afternoon trading on Monday, after data out 
of China brought some relief to investors. The Asian markets ended mixed and the U.S. futures are slightly higher.
Data showed that profits at China's industrial firms increased for a fourth successive month in December as 
economic activity rebounded in the final quarter of the year. Industrial profits increased 17.3 percent year-on-year to 
895.2 billion yuan in December.

which includes some major U.K. companies, is gaining 0.06 percent.
The German DAX, the French CAC 40 and the UK's FTSE 100 are fractionally lower while Switzerland's SMI is up 
0.3 percent.
In Frankfurt, airline Lufthansa is down 1.5 percent.
MunichRe is losing 0.4 percent. Exane BNP cut the stock to ''Neutral'' from ''Outperform.''

falling 0.6 percent.

calendar quarter of 2012 and 2013 forecast.
Chamberlin is plunging close to 16 percent. The company expects to report full year pre-tax profits below current 
market forecasts.
European Markets Marginally Lower
Ryanair is falling 2.1 percent. The budget airline expects lower fourth-quarter traffic on weaker demand.
Filtronic is surging 13 percent. The provider of microwave electronics products for the wireless telecoms 
infrastructure market reported a narrower loss for the first half of the year.
MITIE Group is up 2 percent. The firm said it is performing in line with management's expectations.

Kong's Hang Seng added 0.4 percent while Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.9 percent.
In the U.S., futures point to a marginally higher open on Wall Street, as investors await durable goods orders and 
pending home sales data for December due later in the day. The Federal Open Market Committee holds a two-day 
meeting this week. Policymakers may vote to continue the Fed's bond-buying program as they debate when to end 
the quantitative easing.
In the previous session, U.S. stocks rose as encouraging earnings news from the likes of Procter & Gamble and 
Starbucks helped investors shrug off a report from the Commerce Department showing an unexpected drop in new 
home sales. The Dow and the S&P 500 rose about half a percent each to reach fresh five-year highs, while the 
tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.6 percent.
In the commodity space, crude for March delivery is up $0.01 to $95.89 per barrel and February gold is losing $0.8

(RTTNews) - Amended: corrects to say the company lifted full-year profit outlook, not revenue outlook.
Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported an increase in profit for the third quarter, backed by strong 
traffic and pre-Christmas bookings at higher yields.
Pre-tax profit for the quarter increased to 19.3 million euros from 15.5 million euros in the same period last year.
Profit attributable to equity holders of parent totaled 18.1 million euros or 1.25 cents per share, up from 14.9 million 
euros or 1.02 cents per share last year.
Third-quarter revenues grew 15 percent to 968.8 million euros from 844.4 million euros last year. Traffic grew 3 
percent to 17.3 million passengers.
For the nine-month period, the company reported pre-tax earnings of
698.6 million euros on revenues of 4.07 billion euros. This compares to pre-tax profit of 635.1 million euros and 
revenues of 3.56 billion euros reported last year.
Looking ahead, the company has forecast profit of approximately 540 million euros for the full year, up from 
previous guidance range of 490 million euros to 520 million euros. This represents a 7 percent increase over last 
year, despite a 19 percent increase in oil costs.
However, fourth-quarter traffic is expected to drop by approximately 400 thousand passengers from last year, as it 
grounded up to 80 aircraft, limiting the impact of high oil prices, high airport fees at Stansted and Dublin, and 
seasonally weaker Q4 demand.

(RTTNews) - Ireland-based ultra-low cost carrier Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported a 24.5 
percent increase in third-quarter pre-tax profit backed by strong traffic and pre-Christmas bookings at higher yields 
that offset higher fuel costs. Looking ahead, the company expects lower fourth-quarter traffic on weaker demand, 
but lifted full-year profit view.
For the third quarter, pre-tax profit increased to 19.3 million euros from 15.5 million euros last year. Profit 
attributable to equity holders of parent grew 21 percent to 18.1 million euros, and earnings per share climbed 23 
percent to 1.25 cents.
According to the company, lower than expected operating costs delivered slightly better profits than forecast.
Third-quarter revenues grew 15 percent to 968.8 million euros primarily due to an 8 percent increase in average 
fares, and a 3 percent rise in traffic to 17.3 million passengers.
Scheduled revenues rose 12.2 percent due to a 3 percent rise in passenger numbers and an 8 percent increase in 
average fares. Load factor remained flat at 81 percent. Ancillary revenues grew 24.4 percent, faster than the 3 
percent increase in passenger volume, the company noted.
Operating margin increased 1 point to 4 percent, and operating profits increased 18 percent.
Fuel increased 24 percent due to a higher price per gallon paid and increased activity in the period. Unit costs 
excluding fuel rose 4 percent, while including fuel unit costs rose 11 percent due to excessive increases in Italian 
ATC costs, Spanish airport charges, and the strength of Sterling to the Euro.
Looking ahead, the company expects fourth-quarter traffic to drop by approximately 400 thousand passengers from 
last year, as it grounded up to 80 aircraft, limiting the impact of high oil prices, high airport fees at Stansted and 
Dublin, and seasonally weaker fourth-quarter demand.
However, for the full year, the company now forecast profits close to 540 million euros, higher than previous 
guidance range of 490 million euros to 520 million euros. This represents a 7 percent increase in profits over last 
year, despite a 19 percent increase in oil costs.
According to the company, the revision reflects its improved third-quarter result, capacity cuts and limited visibility 
over Easter bookings and yields, although it has seen some yield softness in January.
Ryanair Lifts FY13 Profit View As Q3 Profit Climbs - Update
Separately, Ryanair issued an update in relation to its takeover offer to Aer Lingus Group Plc (AERL.L), noting that 
it has submitted a radical and unprecedented remedies package to the EU in support of its offer.
Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said, "The remedies involve two upfront buyers each basing aircraft in Ireland to 
takeover and operate a substantial part of Aer Lingus' existing route network and short-haul business. This will be 
the first EU airline merger which will deliver structural divestitures and multiple upfront buyers. We look forward to 
completing our offer for Aer Lingus subject to receiving approval from the EU competition authorities in early

In London, Ryanair shares are currently declining 0.11 euros or 1.91 percent, and are trading at 5.40 euros.
On the Nasdaq, the shares closed Friday's trading at $39.38, up $0.85 or 2.21 percent.

(RTTNews) - European stocks may extend gains for a fourth straight session, mirroring gains in Asian stocks after 
data showed profits at China's industrial firms increased for a fourth successive month in December, adding to 
signs the country's economic rebound is gaining momentum. With economic activity rebounding in the final quarter 
of the year, industrial profits increased 17.3 percent to CNY 895.2 billion in December from a year earlier, the latest 
figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.
Elsewhere, South Korean consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in eight months in January as 
households turned more upbeat about the prospects of their own living conditions as well as the domestic economic 
outlook, the Bank of Korea said in a statement.
China's Shanghai Composite index is rallying 2 percent, while benchmark indexes in Hong Kong, New Zealand, 
Singapore and Taiwan are up between 0.1 percent and 0.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei is down 0.9 percent on profit 
taking after briefly hitting a 32-month high above 11,000 early in the session.
South Korea's Kospi average slipped 0.4 percent, weighed down by a decline in heavyweight Samsung Electronics, 
while the Australian market is closed for a public holiday.
In economic releases, the average asking price for a house in the United Kingdom was unchanged in January, 
property tracking website Hometrack said. That follows the 0.1 percent slide in December and halts a string of six 
straight months of decline.
Across the Atlantic, investors await durable goods orders and pending home sales data for December due later in 
the day. The Federal Open Market Committee, meanwhile, holds a two-day meeting this week, with traders likely to 
keep a close eye on the central bank's statement slated for Wednesday. Chairman Ben Bernanke and his fellow 
policymakers may vote to continue the Fed's bond-buying program as they debate when to end the so-called

December compared with 14.9 million euros a year ago.
European stocks ended Friday's session in positive territory, with Germany's DAX index hitting its highest level 
since January 2008 as investors cheered solid German business data, upbeat comments from the European 
Central Bank and the news of banks returning around 100 billion euros of the three-year emergency aid provided to 
them in late 2011. The German DAX jumped 1.4 percent, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.7 percent and the U.K.'s

(RTTNews) - The European markets ended Monday's trading session with mixed results. Banks were among the 
top performing stocks at the start of the new trading week. Investors were pleased with some positive economic 
data from China, as well as the surge in U.S. durable goods orders. However, the larger than expected decrease in 
U.S. pending home sales provided a note of caution.
Profits at China's industrial firms increased for a fourth successive month in December as economic activity 
rebounded in the final quarter of the year, the latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Sunday.
Industrial profits increased 17.3 percent year-on-year to CNY 895.2 billion in December. In November, profits were

MITIE Group dipped by 0.18 percent. The company said it is performing in line with management's expectations.
A leading indicator of the Eurozone economy increased for the second successive month in December, driven 
mainly by improved consumer and business confidence, data from a survey by the Conference Board showed 
Monday.
The leading economic index increased 0.4 percent on a monthly basis to 105.5 in December after rising 0.6 percent 
in November. The coincident economic index, meanwhile, which measures the current situation, declined to 101.4 
in December from 101.5 in the previous month.
Growth in Eurozone's broad money aggregate or M3 slowed to 3.3 percent in December from 3.8 percent in 
November, data from the European Central Bank showed Monday. Economists expected the rate of growth to 
accelerate to 3.9 percent.
Italy's consumer confidence deteriorated to the lowest level in around seventeen years in January after households 
turned more pessimistic about the economy which contracted further in the third quarter and entered the second 
year of recession, latest data showed Monday. Economists had forecast a modest improvement in sentiment.
The consumer confidence index decreased to 84.6 in January from 85.7 in December, hitting the lowest level since 
1996 when the data series began, statistical office Istat said. Economists were looking for a reading of 86.1. In 
November and October, the figures were 84.8 and 86.2, respectively.
The average asking price for a house in the United Kingdom was unchanged in January, property tracking website 
Hometrack said on Monday. That follows the 0.1 percent slide in December and halts a string of six straight months 
of decline.
With orders for transportation equipment showing a substantial increase, the Commerce Department released a 
report on Monday showing that orders for U.S. manufactured durable goods rose by much more than expected in 
the month of December.
The report showed that durable goods orders surged up by 4.6 percent in December following a 0.7 percent 
increase in November. Economists had been expecting orders to increase by about 1.6 percent.
Pending home sales in the U.S. fell by much more than expected in the month of December, according to a report 
released by the National Association of Realtors on Monday.
NAR said its pending home sales index fell 4.3 percent to 101.7 in December after climbing 1.6 percent to a two-
year high of 106.3 in November. Economists had expected the index to edge down by a much more modest 0.3 
percent.

Who'd have believed it? Much of Europe is mired in a stop-start recession. Yet many European airline stocks are 
taking off like aircraft on a super-short runway. Easyjet's shares - which have more than doubled during the past 
year (helping to prompt chairman Sir Mike Rake's departure) - leapt 10 per cent last week alone. Those in Ryanair, 
reporting third-quarter results today, have risen 17 per cent since late-December.
It all goes to show what a bit of capacity discipline - a lesson hard-learnt in previous recessions - can do. Across 
Europe, scheduled flight capacity probably contracted by 3 per cent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
Within that overall figure, the decline in markets such as Germany and Spain has been more like 10 per cent. This 
reflects the demise of some carriers (Spanair, Italy's Wind Jet); restructuring by both legacy carriers (Lufthansa, 
IAG) and smaller players (Air Berlin); and some helpful moves by budget airlines themselves (Ryanair again parked 
aircraft recently). So load factors have remained high, and revenues per seat have grown. EasyJet, say, reported 
an 89 per load factor and 8 per cent year-on-year rise in revenues per seat in the fourth quarter of 2012. On the 
cost side, oil prices, while high, have been stable and weather disruptions, modest.
The challenge for investors is to predict the flight path ahead. With restructuring by legacy carriers ongoing and the 
demise of more smaller fry possible, capacity growth should remain muted: Citibank anticipates a 2-3 per cent 
expansion in available seat kilometres in 2013. Costs continue to be pared, especially at flag carriers - witness the 
potential IAG-Vueling moves. So even the most generous earnings-based multiples - easyJet is on 12 times 2013 
consensus earnings, Ryanair, 15 times - do not look excessive. Still cruising altitude may be approaching, so 
investors need to pick their seats with care.

 Attention will focus on how far a sharp fall in European sales has hurt Ford Motor when the US's second-biggest 
carmaker by sales announces its full-year results, writes Robert Wright .
The company, again solidly profitable in its US domestic market, has suffered some of the sharpest falls of any big 
carmaker as demand for new cars across Europe has fallen to levels last seen nearly 20 years ago.
Ford's December sales in its core European markets were 27 per cent down on December 2011, while sales across 
the continent for the year fell 13.2 per cent year on year. Analysts expect net income for the year to be 12 per cent 
down on 2011 at $5.37bn, on revenue down 2.3 per cent to $125bn.   Yahoo's last results marked the earnings call 
debut of Marissa Mayer, the former Google executive appointed as the struggling web portal's chief in July, writes  
Tim Bradshaw .
Her strategy is to put mobile and "daily habits", such as checking news or sports scores, at the heart of a product-
centric turnround. However, in addressing how to make people to spend more time at Yahoo, she had little to say 
about those who spend money there: advertisers.
Corporate Diary
After meeting with brands and agencies at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, Ms Mayer's plans to 
galvanise Yahoo's search and display businesses may now be more fully formed. And they are badly needed: Mark 
Mahaney at RBC forecasts growth of just 2 per cent in display and 3 per cent in search for the company's fourth-
quarter results, with $1.23bn in net revenue overall and $0.29 per share in earnings.

  Diageo shares have been on a roll and investors will be looking to the world's biggest distiller to deliver on the 
expected 5.2 per cent organic net sales growth when it reports interims - itself a deceleration from the previous 
year's 7 per cent, writes  Louise Lucas .
Analysts are looking for the maker of Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whisky to lift organic operating profit by 
8.6 per cent, pre-exceptionals, to £2bn.
Like other purveyors of consumer goods, and in keeping with its own recent performance, Diageo is likely to 
present a polarised world: with wilting thirsts in western Europe and more buoyant growth in emerging markets.
The latter now account for some 40 per cent of group sales and are targeted to reach half. Investors will also look 
for clues on the US, where some analysts warn of a weaker performance from beers along with "solid" spirits sales.
The consensus earnings per share is for 60.3p, up from 55.9p at the halfway stage a year ago.

Mannheimer Swartling, a Swedish law firm, will present its results to the board of the Stockholm-based 
telecommunications operator on Thursday night and to the public this morning.
Telia asked the lawyers to review the circumstances surrounding its purchase of telecoms licences in the central 
Asian country after claims that Takilant, the company Telia had paid the money to, was controlled by a friend of the 
daughter of Uzbekistan's president.
Swedish courts have ordered one of the biggest asset freezes in domestic history on Takilant.
That in turn has increased pressure on Telia, whose chief executive has pledged to resign if corruption is proved, 
and the Swedish government, the company's biggest shareholder.

The bigger picture for Ryanair and Morocco

North Africa is in the news for all the wrong reasons at the moment. But amid the stark headlines of hostage taking 
in Algeria, a story about the expansion of one major Irish company into the region went largely unremarked.
Possible Ryanair expansion beyond Europe's borders -- be it to Russia, Israel or even the east coast of the US -- is 
a source of constant rumour and speculation. But the low-cost carrier chose to establish its first non-European base 
in Morocco. Some believe that other Irish companies are overlooking opportunities in the north African country, and 
Ryanair's move could help raise its profile here.
The Ryanair move came despite an earlier high profile spat with the Moroccan state airports company on 
passenger charges, something that elsewhere in the past has proved enough for the airline to abandon airports for 
good. While Ryanair's Moroccan expansion was clearly based on European appetites for a sun holiday in warmer 
climes, there was also speculation that it could be tempted into some domestic routes.
Ryanair is not the only Irish company with big ambitions in the north African country. Some believe that, with a 
population of 33 million, economic growth and the most stable political situation in the region, there are plenty of 
opportunities for other Irish companies.
Oil and gas exploration, a sector in which there are a large number of small Irish players, provides an obvious 
example.
Limerick-based Circle Oil enjoyed a sharp rise in turnover last year as it began producing 4.5 million cubic feet of 
gas per day in Morocco, helped by the completion of a new pipeline in the country. Former Smart Telecom chief 
executive Oisin Fanning's San Leon also holds five Moroccan licenses covering more than 53,000 square 
kilometres.
One of the most ambitious Irish operators in Morocco is Fastnet Oil and Gas, which is planning a drilling campaign 
in the country in 2014. Its managing director, Paul Griffiths, is a big fan of the north African country and believes 
Ireland can learn from it.
The bigger picture for Ryanair and Morocco
"Morocco imports 95 per cent of its energy, just as Ireland does," he said.
"But the difference is that Morocco has a very proactive fiscal regime that encourages companies like ours to 
explore. In Morocco the state takes 25 per cent that is carried through exploration but that pays its way through 
development. That is quite an attractive option because it means that the state is aligned with us as partners 
commercially. So if we make money they make money and ultimately the Moroccan taxpayer makes money.  "
International interest in Morocco as a frontier exploration province is steadily growing, with US giant Chevron 
signing a major agreement with the country last week.
But Griffiths, who spends a lot of time in Morocco, thinks that the country offers opportunities far beyond the 
exploration sector, particularly in areas such as mobile technology, renewable energy and the food industry.
"This is a market that could be exploited. Irish exploration companies going into Morocco do not bring huge profile, 
but Ryanair setting up bases there does. I would hope that at government level it will be used as a catalyst for more 
Irish companies to get involved."
One of the country's big attractions, given the situation in other parts of Africa, is its openness and liberalism, said 
Griffiths.
"It was not untouched by the Arab Spring. There were demonstrations. But it says a lot about how the country is 
developing politically that there was no violence and that people were allowed to demonstrate in the first place."
Nevertheless, the profile of Morocco in Ireland is low. Currently, Ireland exports about EUR 60 million worth of 
goods to the north African country annually, mainly pharmaceuticals from big Irish-based multinationals, and 
imports about EUR 30 million, largely in fertilisers.
Enterprise Ireland said it is not a priority market and very few of its client companies export to it. Although a 
spokeswoman said that the agency is monitoring the economic and political situation across North Africa, it is 
unlikely to increase its focus on Morocco in the mid-term.
John Whelan of the Irish Exporters Association is not surprised at Enterprise Ireland's lack of interest. It cannot 
focus on every market and prioritises time and effort towards certain locations, he said. Nevertheless, Whelan 
believes that although Morocco is a relatively small market, it does provide very good potential, not least because it 
has a free trade agreement with the EU.
Whelan believes the key opportunities are in agri foods for products such as meat, dried milk and Tayto crisps are 
understood to have already made inroads into the market. Irish information technology companies, particularly 
those in mobile technology, may also be attracted because of strong growth.
"It is stable, has a growing economy and offers niche opportunities for a range of exporters. Even more importantly, 
it could be a perfect place for establishing a distribution point with a local agent for other north African countries.  
Whelan draws the comparison with American corporations using Ireland as a plank for the rest of the EU. He 
believes that other north African countries will stabilise and provide huge market opportunities in the coming years.
"Using Morocco as a strategic entry point to this wider market and building up the necessary structures and 
relationships could act as an early strategy for Irish companies. They could get good margin on the Moroccon 
market itself and then as the north African market opens up they are in a good position to take advantage. It is not 
mainstream, but it is a strategic move with a range of niche opportunities."

The European Court will give judgment on Thursday in the case of Dublin woman Denise McDonagh, who sued 
Ryanair for more than EUR 1,000 spent after her Ryanair flight was cancelled because of the eruption of the 
Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland in April 2010. The eruption led to the closure of much of European air-space.
McDonagh spent EUR 1,129 on meals, accommodation and transport, but Ryanair refused to refund the money, to 
which she would normally be entitled under EU law. It argued that the closure of European airspace went beyond 
the "extraordinary circumstances" which the regulation provides for.
The Dublin District Court has asked the Court of Justice whether airlines have to refund costs in such 
circumstances.

EasyJet buoyed as rivals reduce passenger capacity
EasyJet buoyed as rivals reduce passenger capacity

Capacity cuts over the slow winter season by rival short-haul airlines and a jump in the number of business 
travellers have buoyed first-quarter revenues at easyJet.
Europe's second-largest low-cost carrier by revenues (behind Ryanair   ) yesterday reported turnover in the final 
three months of last year up 9.2 per cent year-on-year to £833m, boosted by a 6.2 per cent increase in passenger 
numbers to 13.7m.
The Luton-based airline said starting more flights to Italy, Switzerland and France during the final three months of 
the year - traditionally a slow period for airlines - would help it narrow its expected interim loss.
"EasyJet has made a strong start to the year due to a combination of management action, competitor capacity 
reductions and the benign operating environment," said Carolyn McCall, chief executive.
In an effort to coax business travellers away from full-service airlines such as Lufthansa and British Airways, 
easyJet has introduced flexible tickets and allocated seating.
Last year, easyJet carried 10m business passengers - up from 9m the previous year - out of a total of roughly 60m.
EasyJet said about 80 per cent of its seats for the first half to March 31 were already booked, leading the carrier to 
forecast an interim loss of £50m-£75m, which compares with a loss of £112m the previous year.
Airlines traditionally report a loss over the cooler months, relying on the peak summer travel period to offset winter 
capacity cuts and lower passenger numbers.
Its load factor - a key industry measure of how well a carrier fills its aircraft - rose 1 percentage point to 88.6 per 
cent for the quarter. Average revenue per passenger - which excludes air passenger duty - rose 2.8 per cent year 
on year to £60.80 for the quarter, helping offset an 0.5 per cent increase in costs per seat, excluding fuel.
EasyJet buoyed as rivals reduce passenger capacity
The airline refused to take a backward step in its public spat with Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, confirming that it 
continued to evaluate the case for ordering aircraft with more fuelefficient engines, and was considering short-haul 
models by Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier.
"It is clear that there is a substantial operating cost advantage from the next-generation engine technology," said 
easyJet.
Last week, Sir Stelios reignited his public feud with the low-cost carrier he founded, by selling off part of his stake in 
protest over easyJet's fleet expansion plans.
The possible fleet expansion has long been opposed by Sir Stelios, whose family owns a 36 per cent stake in the 
carrier.
EasyJet shares rose 5 per cent to 897.5p in afternoon trading.

Body
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, expects passenger growth to slow in 2013 as it cuts back on short-
distance flights in some markets due to higher airport fees, its chief executive told Reuters on Tuesday.
"I think the growth will be slower this year," Michael O'Leary said, predicting passenger numbers would increase 3-4 
percent to up to 82.5 million in the year to March 2014.
That compares with expected growth of 4.2 percent in the Irish airline's financial year ending March 2013.
"The summer this year will be mostly flat, most of the growth will happen in the winter of 2013-2014," O'Leary said. 
O'Leary said the company, which is expanding longer-distance flights, was aiming to order aircraft from aerospace 
company Boeing in late 2013 or early 2014. He described as "overstated" Boeing's difficulties with the new 
Dreamliner 787 model, grounded by authorities around the world last week after a series of technical problems. 
Ryanair is still in talks with the European Commission about a bid to take over Irish rival Aer Lingus, but O'Leary 
said he expects the Commission to give a green light. "We don't expect it to go to an appeal process because it will 
be very difficult for the commission to reject this package of remedies because they are so transformational and 
revolutionary," O'Leary said, referring to concessions that Ryanair has proposed in a bid to address competition 
concerns. The 694-million-euro (dollar 924 million) takeover bid is being examined on competition grounds. The 
European Commission blocked a previous bid in 2007, saying it would create a monopoly on Irish flights. The 
takeover is also opposed by the Irish government, which owns 25 percent of Aer Lingus. Ryanair, which owns 30 
percent of Aer Lingus, dropped a second offer in 2009. In its latest round of concessions, Ryanair has offered to 
give up half of its 92 routes, according to a person familiar with the matter. It would give three of Aer Lingus' 
Heathrow routes to British Airways and 43 other routes to Flybe , the person said. Speaking in Rome after the 
announcement of new routes from Italy to North Africa, O'Leary said he was not worried by political instability in the 
region. "The new regimes will be seen to be delivering some growth and some economic activity and I think 
Ryanair expects slow growth in 2013; Ryanair expects
deregulation and open skies is one of the first things those regimes are looking at, so we're talking to the Tunisians, 
the Libyans, the Egyptians," O'Leary said. ( C ) Reuters

Ryanair 's last-ditch attempt for Aer Lingus TRAVEL & LEISURE

Ryanair is offering to sell about 40 per cent of Aer Lingus' short haul operations to Flybe, the UK regional airline, in 
a last-ditch attempt to prevent its takeover bid for the Irish flag carrier being blocked by the European Commission.
Under a new package of concessions intended to address competition concerns, Flybe would acquire Aer Lingus 
operations on 23 routes where the Ryanair merger would create a monopoly.
In addition to the Flybe offer, Ryanair would give British Airways, part of International Airlines Group, the right to buy 
approximately half of Aer Lingus's lucrative Heathrow slots, which are used to provide services to Dublin, Shannon 
and Cork.
"We've submitted a very radical package of remedies," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, yesterday, in 
an interview with Bloomberg that did not include details of the package.
Ryanair faces a struggle to secure European regulatory approval for its third takeover bid for Aer Lingus, with a 
ruling expected in early March.
The European Commission has objected to Ryanair's bid on competition grounds, arguing it creates a monopoly on 
about 46 routes, and antitrust problems on a further 20. It prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus in 2006 - and 
Brussels regulators have never cleared a merger that they previously rejected.
Ryanair's sweetened offer comes after Brussels rejected its first two attempts to address competition concerns. 
Under a package submitted in December , Ryanair offered Flybe the right to operate flights for three years on 20 
routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus currently both have services. It also gave British Airways up to 20 pairs of 
slots for daily flights from Heathrow.
But the latest, updated package involves a more traditional divestment to Flybe - a deal that is generally preferred 
by the commission.
Ryanair 's last-ditch attempt for Aer Lingus TRAVEL & LEISURE
To make it possible for Flybe to take the Aer Lingus operations on, the deal may be structured similarly to the 2007 
transaction in which Exeter-based Flybe acquire BA's regional operations. In that deal, BA paid Flybe £130m to 
take the unprofitable business and 1,500 staff off its hands.
Any deal to sell parts of Aer Lingus would also need to the consent of the unions, as it would see a large chunk of 
the workforce transferred to Flybe.
Ryanair is still facing strong resistance to its proposed Aer Lingus takeover from the Irish government . Last month, 
before the revised remedies were put forward, Dublin said it would not support Ryanair's bid and was unwilling to 
sell the state's 25 per cent stake to the airline.

Ryanair has denied claims in the press today that the airline is poised to make a big aircraft purchase from Boeing.
"Don't believe all of what you read in the press. Michael O'Leary confirmed in Rome yesterday (22 Jan) that there is 
no aircraft order imminent and none that is expected until perhaps the end of calendar 2013 or early 2014, at the 
earliest," spokesman, Stephen McNamara said.
It had been reported that Ryanair is closing in on a deal to buy at least 150 Boeing 737 passenger jets and the 
contract could be signed within weeks.
But this was dismissed as speculation by the airline this afternoon. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary had 
told Reuters in an interview yesterday that talks with Boeing, which have been ongoing for several years, were 
unlikely to yield a deal until late this year or early 2014.

no aircraft order imminent and none that is expected until perhaps the end of calendar 2013 or early 2014, at the 
earliest," spokesman, Stephen McNamara said.
It had been reported that Ryanair is closing in on a deal to buy at least 150 Boeing 737 passenger jets and the 
contract could be signed within weeks.
But this was dismissed as speculation by the airline this afternoon. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary had 
told Reuters in an interview yesterday that talks with Boeing, which have been ongoing for several years, were 
unlikely to yield a deal until late this year or early 2014.

Ryanair expects drag on growth ? Low-cost airline Ryanair expects passenger growth to slow in 2013 as it cuts 
back on short-distance flights in some markets due to higher airport fees, chief executive Michael O'Leary said 
yesterday. "I think the growth will be slower this year," he told Reuters, predicting passenger numbers would 
increase three to four per cent to up to £82.5m in the year to March 2014. That compares with expected growth of 
4.2 per cent in the current financial year.

Ryanair expects that the EU will give it the green light to takeover rival Aer Lingus, CEO Michael O'Leary said 
today.
He added that he expects passenger growth to slow in 2013 as it cuts back on short-distance flights in some 
markets due to higher airport fees.
"I think the growth will be slower this year," Michael O'Leary said, predicting passenger numbers would increase 3-4 
percent to up to 82.5 million in the year to March 2014.
That compares with expected growth of 4.2 percent in the Irish airline's financial year ending March 2013. "The 
summer this year will be mostly flat, most of the growth will happen in the winter of 2013-2014," O'Leary said. 
O'Leary said the company, which is expanding longer-distance flights, was aiming to order aircraft from aerospace 
company Boeing in late 2013 or early 2014. He described as "overstated" Boeing's difficulties with the new 
Dreamliner 787 model, grounded by authorities around the world last week after a series of technical problems. 
Ryanair is still in talks with the European Commission about a bid to take over rival Aer Lingus, but O'Leary said he 
expects the Commission to give a green light. "We don't expect it to go to an appeal process because it will be very 
difficult for the commission to reject this package of remedies because they are so transformational and 
revolutionary," O'Leary said, referring to concessions that Ryanair has proposed in a bid to address competition 
concerns. The 694-million-euro takeover bid is being examined on competition grounds. The European Commission 
blocked a previous bid in 2007, saying it would create a monopoly on Irish flights. The takeover is also opposed by 
the Irish government, which owns 25 percent of Aer Lingus. Ryanair, which owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus, dropped 
a second offer in 2009. Speaking in Rome after the announcement of new routes from Italy to North Africa, O'Leary 
said he was not worried by political instability in the region. "The new regimes will be seen to be delivering some

growth and some economic activity and I think deregulation and open skies is one of the first things those regimes 
are looking at, so we're talking to the Tunisians, the Libyans, the Egyptians," O'Leary said.

Body
Public ownership is on the march again, in a modest way, with council-owned Manchester Airports Group agreeing 
to buy London's Stansted , the UK's fourth-biggest airport by passenger numbers, for £1.5bn. Joseph Chamberlain, 
the 19th-century Birmingham mayor who pioneered the purchase of gas and water companies, would have 
understood. MAG is majority-owned by Manchester City Council, with the remaining 45 per cent owned by Greater 
Manchester's other nine boroughs. It already owns East Midlands and Bournemouth airports. MAG's Australian 
partner, Industry Funds Management, will take just over a third of the expanded group.
Manchester Airports, which tried to buy Gatwick in 2009, recently overtook Stansted to be the UK's third-largest 
airport by passenger numbers. The independent Northern Economic Futures Commission has called for 
Manchester to be developed as the UK's second international airport hub after Heathrow, but this looks like the 
north putting its money on airport expansion in the south.
The £1.5bn price looks high for an airport whose passenger numbers are declining and which is reliant on one 
airline, Ryanair, for 70 per cent of its traffic. But if Stansted is eventually chosen as the new hub for London, it will 
look cheap. At least this looks like a more promising form of public ownership than the panicky rescue of banks in 
the credit crisis.

End of an era as tower tumbles
Peter Bish asks us to join him in mourning the passing of his office for many years, the 38.8m (127ft) control tower 
at Heathrow, which has just been demolished as part of the modernisation of the airport's Terminals 1 and 2.
The tower, along with the whole of the original Central Area, comprising Terminal 2 and the Queens Building, is 
being cleared to make way for the new "Heathrow East" mega terminal, now, confusedly, to be renamed Terminal 
2. The current T1 faces the same fate as the old T2.
The Queens Building and what later became Terminal 2 were part of the original Frederick Gibberd red-brick 
buildings that were the nerve centre of the new London airport when they opened in 1955. But by the turn of the 
century, T2 had become cramped and unloved.
Progress, of course, but "sad news for us former Heathrow ATCOs", says Peter, who took this shot (right) on 10 
January and is co-author of Heathrow ATC: The First 50 Years.
Power of eight
First it was the A380 and 787 - aircraft designations that used the number 8, which is seen as lucky by the Chinese 
airlines it was hoped would make up a significant proportion of customers.
Then the G250 business jet became the G280, although Gulfstream had an added incentive after finding out that, in 
Chinese, the pronunciation of 250 is similar to the word for stupid.
Now even the airlines are "eight" it, with British Airways making a big play of the fact that its flights to and from 
Chengdu - to be launched later this year - will carry the numbers BA88 and BA89. It is also offering promotional 
fares of [pounds sterling]508, although its faith in the power of the magic number does not go so far as to give seats 
away for [pounds sterling]8.
End of an era as tower tumbles.
And there is no truth in the rumour that Willie Walsh is changing the airline's name to British Eightways in a bid to 
lure Chinese passengers.
All talk
Clive Lawrence has an answer to Peter Martin's question "What does it mean?" about a piece of management-
speak from our interview with Volvo Aero executives - Yuckspeak #924 (Flight International, 8 January).
"My Babelfish tells me: despite not being able to change anything, they are trying to please all the people all the 
time," says Clive.
He adds: "As for who speaks like this: try any politician."
Ryan hot air
It has been dubbed the worst job in PR - by none other than Michael O'Leary, the man who is doing the recruiting. 
Ryanair has drawn up a shortlist of candidates to replace Stephen McNamara as head of communications for the 
frills-free airline.
Scathing wit, thick skin and endless energy are doubtless attributes for the "brave soul" O'Leary says he wants for 
the "high profile and incredibly overpaid" challenge.
Business class travel definitely not among the perks.

The ISEQ rose modestly in thin trading this morning as European shares nudged towards a two-year high.
By 12:30, the index was up 7.79 points to 3,487.48.
IRI data for the US off-trade showed that the cider category continues to grow strongly from its low base. The off- 
trade cider category grew volume by 94pc year-on-year (yoy) in the four weeks to December 30th. This compares 
very favourably to growth in beer (-3.1pc); imports (-2.1pc); craft (+9pc); and PABs (+7.6pc). The 12-month growth 
trend for the off-trade cider category was 78pc. Cider's share of the overall beer market in December was 0.3pc. C 
and C/Vermont's domestic cider, Woodchuck (the no. 2 brand in the off-trade), grew volume by +30pc in December. 
The 12- month trend showed 37pc volume growth. Woodchuck held 33pc category volume share in December. C 
and C's shares rose 4c to E4.59.
Stansted has been sold to Manchester Airports Group for £1.5bn - an 11.7pc premium to its estimated regulated 
assets base at end-December 2012 (£1,342.7) and for c.16x EBITDA for 2012. The passenger numbers are 17.5m 
with 14 airlines operating there. Stansted airport numbers have dropped by over a quarter since peak after airport 
charges and discounts were unwound in 2007, and Ryanair (75pc of the airport capacity) will be the key in growing 
traffic. "If agreement can be reached on a growth deal, Stansted could be one of the building blocks for Ryanair's 
renewed growth in the future. Ryanair also has a base at Manchester airport as well as East Midlands and 
Bournemouth airports (all owned by Manchester Airports Group)," said Davy. Shares in Ryanair rose 2c to E5.31.

very favourably to growth in beer (-3.1pc); imports (-2.1pc); craft (+9pc); and PABs (+7.6pc). The 12-month growth 
trend for the off-trade cider category was 78pc. Cider's share of the overall beer market in December was 0.3pc. C 
and C/Vermont's domestic cider, Woodchuck (the no. 2 brand in the off-trade), grew volume by +30pc in December. 
The 12- month trend showed 37pc volume growth. Woodchuck held 33pc category volume share in December. C 
and C's shares rose 8c to E4.63.
Stansted has been sold to Manchester Airports Group for £1.5bn - an 11.7pc premium to its estimated regulated 
assets base at end-December 2012 (£1,342.7) and for c.16x EBITDA for 2012. The passenger numbers are 17.5m 
with 14 airlines operating there. Stansted airport numbers have dropped by over a quarter since peak after airport 
charges and discounts were unwound in 2007, and Ryanair (75pc of the airport capacity) will be the key in growing 
traffic. "If agreement can be reached on a growth deal, Stansted could be one of the building blocks for Ryanair's 
renewed growth in the future. Ryanair also has a base at Manchester airport as well as East Midlands and 
Bournemouth airports (all owned by Manchester Airports Group)," said Davy. Shares in Ryanair were flat at E5.29.

STANSTED'S new owners are aiming to finalise their purchase by the end of February, before trying to reverse the 
London airport's falling passenger numbers.
Manchester Airports Group and Australia-based Industry Funds Management have pledged that it will be "business 
as usual" at Stansted while the pair's £1.5bn acquisition is completed.
The firms have said the airport has potential for "significant volume growth over the short, medium and long term".
MAG, which has been pursuing Stansted for more than a year, has previously flagged up its success in property 
management, retail and car parking as good grounds for its bid.
Charlie Cornish, MAG chief executive, has also set his sights on restoring Stansted to its 2007 traffic peak within a 
decade.
Traffic at Stansted has fallen by a quarter since a record 23.8m passengers used the leisure-focused air-port in 
2006/7. Stansted's performance was hit by the economic slowdown and subsequent financial turbulence for many 
airlines, along with a question mark over ownership following a 2009 Competition Commission ruling.
Heathrow Airport Holdings, which ditched its BAA branding weeks before the Stansted deal was announced, had 
been forced to sell the airport after losing its final appeal against the antitrust ruling last year.
It is thought that Heathrow will use the proceeds of the sale to pay down some of its £12bn debt pile, as it did with 
the earlier sales of Gatwick and Edinburgh airports.
Stansted's new owners look for traffic growth
Ryanair, the airline responsible for almost 70 per cent of Stansted's traffic, said at the weekend that it welcomed the 
sale.
The budget airline added that its team "look forward to working with the team at MAG to develop low fare traffic 
growth at Stansted", after deciding not to join in with the auction in October.

IT WAS a terrible week to announce the sale of an airport. Snow has sent air travel into meltdown, in spite of 
airports' best efforts to stock up on pricey new ploughs and grit, while safety fears over Boeing's new Dreamliner 
planes are playing havoc with the industry's public image.
For Stansted, however, any buyer would have been good news. It's been more than three years since the 
Competition Commission put a question mark over the airport's ownership, starting a volley of ultimately fruitless 
appeals while traffic dwindled.
Heathrow Airport Holdings, known as BAA until its antitrustenforced asset sales stripped it of all but four airports, 
has done well to get £1.5bn for an airport that brings a quarter fewer passengers through its doors than it did half a 
decade ago. More than two-thirds of its traffic relies on Ryanair's routes.
Manchester Airports Group, which already owns Bournemouth and East Midlands airports, justified the price tag by 
talking up Stansted's "significant growth potential".
Stansted is indeed only half full, based on its current deal with the government to carry up to 35m passengers a 
year on its single runway. Its cargo operations also have space to grow.
But MAG and its new partner, Industry Funds Management, have their work cut out to turn around the airport's 
sliding traffic.
According to the most recent Civil Aviation Authority passenger survey, Stansted has the edge when it comes to 
value-for-money: a third of Stansted passengers choose the airport for cost reasons.
Airport owners can't control the weather... or airlines
Heathrow attracts roughly the same proportion thanks to the routes it offers, but its customers score higher on 
airport loyalty. Poaching Heathrow's passengers, or persuading Stansted's existing customers to try new flights to 
growth markets such as Brazil, is no easy task.
The CAA is also the body responsible for keeping a lid on airport charges, a cap that cushions ticket prices from 
steep hikes but represents a longstanding bugbear of Stansted's current managers.
This makes the new owners' relationship with Ryanair even more important.
Michael O'Leary's firm, which has welcomed Stansted's new owners, decided to scrap 90 per cent of its 
Manchester routes in a spat over airport charges in 2009.
MAG and IFM are both experienced airport owners, with plenty of ideas intended to improve Stansted's 
performance. After three years of uncertainty and 18 months putting together a proposal, there's plenty to do. But 
they can't control the weather - or Ryanair's reactions to their ambitious plans.

The European Commission looks likely to extend the February 27 deadline it has set to assess the Ryanair bid for 
Aer Lingus.
Contacts between the commission and Ryanair are continuing amid indications that Ryanair has proposed 
additional concessions to try to meet EC concerns that a merger of it and Aer Lingus would seriously damage 
competition in the Irish airline market.
A spokesperson for the commission refused to comment on any aspect of its discussions, including the likelihood of 
an extension to the original deadline. Extending the bid period would indicate that it is now in serious discussions 
with Ryanair and other parties, but does not give any further pointer to what it will decide.
Ryanair met commission officials earlier this month in Brussels and, it is believed, shortcomings in the competition 
remedies it proposed were outlined. EU competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said afterwards that Ryanair 
was expected to respond to the concerns.
Ryanair bid EUR 1.30 for Aer Lingus last summer and, after the EC rejected its initial plan to introduce fresh 
competition into the market, tabled a revised plan in December.
Under this plan, British Airways and Flybe, another British airline, would commit to base planes in Ireland and fly 
many of the routes currently served by Aer Lingus, to provide competition to the merged entity.
It is likely that talks between Ryanair and the commission centre on the structure of this arrangement and how firm 
the commitments are from BA and Flybe to provide competition in the long term. Industry experts believe the 
commission will also be sounding out BA and Flybe and say the attitude of Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA's 
parent, IAG, is likely to be crucial.

Ryanair today rejected claims made by an MEP that its one-bag-rule per passenger was profit-driven "Wild West" 
style opportunism, saying that the rule is there for safety reasons.
Socialist MEP Paul Murphy has asked the European Parliament to put forward a proposal for the European 
Commission to take action on the restrictive carry-on bag rule imposed by some airlines.
The transport committee oral question also called on the Commission to address rules on items such as laptop 
bags and restrictions on passengers' airport retail purchases by setting a common upper limit on the size and 
weight of hand luggage on all EU flights.
But Ryanair today rejected the accusations and said that its 1 carry-on bag rule is necessary for safety reasons. 
"The inaccurate claims made by some MEP's yesterday that Ryanair's free of charge carry-on bag policy was 
designed to "generate revenues" were absurd and untrue. The purpose of Ryanair's free of charge 10kgs carry-on 
bag is to allow passengers to avoid our checked in bag fees. 75pc of Ryanair's 80m passengers now travel without 
paying any checked in bag fees, while availing of our 10kg free of charge carry-on bag facility. This reduces 
Ryanair's revenues (and our costs)," said Ryanair spokesman, Stephen McNamara. "Ryanair's 1 carry-on bag rule 
cannot be changed for safety reasons. It would be helpful if these MEP's made some basic attempt to understand 
Ryanair's safety and low fare policies before making false and inaccurate claims in the European parliament. The 
idea that Europe's only ultra-low fares airline, which has pioneered low fare travel and continues to promote free of 
charge carry-on bags (when other airlines are increasingly charging for carry-on bags) and lower prices than any 
other airline, is somehow an example of "capitalist greed", is as absurd as some of these MEP's claiming to care 
about consumers, while travelling on high fare airlines at the taxpayers' expense." However, MEP Murphy said the 
one-bag rule was "a means for airlines to maximise profits at all costs". Addressing the European Parliament, he 
said: "Many airlines use this one-bag rule, not in the interests of passenger safety or comfort, but simply as a

The owners of Stansted, London's third-biggest airport, yesterday received three final bids for the hub, in a sale that 
is likely to value it at about £1bn.
Final bidders included Manchester Airports Group in partnership with Australia's Industry Funds Management, 
infrastructure fund Macquarie and Malaysia Airports, according to people familiar with the situation. A decision on 
the sale was expected as early as this week, two of the people added, after its owner Heathrow airport Holdings, 
formerly known as BAA, finally agreed last summer to sell the airport following a 2009 Competition Commission 
order.
The MAG consortium has been seen as a leading contender. MAG owns the Manchester, East Midlands and 
Bournemouth airports. Under the terms of their partnership deal, Industry Funds Management will buy 35 per cent 
of MAG's equity and get half its voting rights if the pair win Stansted.
MAG might be better positioned than others to negotiate with Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, given its 
dealings with the low-cost airline at its airports. Ryanair represents two-thirds of Stansted's customers.
Regulated airports such as Stansted, which analysts say could fetch about £1bn,   appeal to investors looking for 
inflation-pegged returns.
Deutsche Bank and ING are advising Stansted's owners on the sale. Both declined to comment. MAG, Macquarie 
and Heathrow airport Holdings declined to comment. Malaysian Airports was not immediately available for 
comment.

THREE suitors have made final bids for Stansted, valuing the north east London airport at around £1bn, two 
sources said yesterday.
Macquarie, Malaysia Airport Holdings and Manchester Airports Group with its partner IFM are the three bidders left 
in the contest for the airport.
A deal to buy the leisure travelfocused airport from Heathrow Airport Holdings, previously known as BAA, could be 
announced next week.
HAH was ordered to sell Stansted after it lost a final appeal against a Competition Commission decision last 
August.
The case wound its way through the appeals system for three years, after the Competition Commission ruled that 
the airport and others in Scotland must be sold off.
The sale initially attracted a string of private equity bidders and infrastructure funds including TPG and 3i 
Infrastructure.
Ryanair, which operates 70 per cent of Stansted's flights, also expressed an interest in making a joint bid, but pulled 
out in October blaming parent firm Ferrovial's reluctance to engage.
HAH, which declined to comment yesterday, is being advised by ING and Deutsche Bank during the sale process.

United Parcel Service Inc. has walked away from a proposed $6.9 billion takeover of the Netherlands TNT Express 
NV, claiming European Commission regulators had demanded too many concessions for the deal to remain viable.
The Commission, the executive arm of the 27 EU countries, reviews major corporate mergers and acquisitions to 
ensure they do not hurt fair competition in the market. It has the power to block deals or to demand concessions, 
such as the sale of business parts.
Here is a glance at some of the major decisions made by the Commission's competition authority:
 In 2001, the Commission blocked General Electric Co. from buying another U.S.-based multinational, Honeywell 
International Inc.
 In 2004, it demanded that Sony Corp. sell its Japanese music unit as a condition of the merger of its music 
business with that of Bertelsmann AG. The deal created Sony BMG.
 In 2007, the Commission blocked Irish budget airline Ryanair from buying smaller the national carrier Aer Lingus.
 Also in 2007, it approved Universal Music's takeover of BMG Music Publishing, which was not part of the Sony 
BMG deal in 2004. Universal is owned by France's Vivendi SA.
 The same year, it allowed the carve-up of ABN Amro NV the largest takeover in banking history by a consortium 
led by RBS PLC and including Belgium's Fortis SA and Spain's Santander, with Bank of America as a side-player. 
The deal turned out to be a disaster for all the acquiring banks when the financial crisis struck just months later.
 In 2008, Mining giant BHP Billiton PLC abandoned an attempted takeover of rival Rio Tinto PLC after the 
Commission raised concerns it would hurt competitiveness in Europe.
 In February 2012, Google Inc. won unconditional approval to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion.
 Also in February, the Commission blocked a merger between Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext, saying it 
would have led to a near-monopoly in European financial derivatives.
A look at corporate deals the EU has ruled on
 In September, the Commission approved Universal Music Group's takeover of EMI Music, on condition that 
Universal, the largest global music company, sell about a third of EMI's assets.
 In December, the Commission approved the merger between commodities trader Glencore and Xstrata, a major 
mining group, but only on the condition that it sell its stake in Nyrstar NV of Belgium, the world's largest zinc 
producer.
 The Commission is due to announce later this week on a new offer by Ryanair to buy Aer Lingus.

Boardroom: Ryanair bid has reached 11th hour
Boardroom: Ryanair bid has reached 11th hour

Body
The significant thing about the news that broke last week about the European Commission looking for further 
concessions from Ryanair in relation to its Aer Lingus bid was that the Brussels bureaucrats -- after rejecting the 
terms of Ryanair's first offer out of hand -- were engaging at all with Michael O'Leary.
There are two possibilities here. One is that the EU competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, is gearing up to 
reject the bid, but wants to ensure that Ryanair is given a chance to puts its case and amend its plan in order to try 
and guard against the decision being overturned later in the European Court.
The other possibility is that the commission might consider giving the bid the green light if O'Leary 'gives' enough 
and if, vitally, the other airlines which have promised to provide competition to a merged Ryanair and Aer Lingus 
give sufficient guarantees in relation to their intentions.
On balance, you would have to say that O'Leary still faces a mountain to climb. Time is running out on the 
commission's timetable and, while we don't know exactly what passed between Ryanair and the commission at a 
meeting last week in Brussels, we do know that the EC is seeking additional concessions and guarantees -- and 
that Ryanair will presumably have to engage with British Airways (BA) and Flybe in trying to agree these very 
quickly.
The crunch issue is whether competition can be guaranteed out of Ireland in the long term by these two airlines -- in 
particular, just how firm are their commitments to Ireland?
Here the key figure remains the chief executive of IAG -- BA's parent -- Willie Walsh. Is he willing to enter the public 
fray to support the bid? How binding a commitment will he make to routes out of Ireland and basing planes here, 
and for how long?
The world of 'realpolitik' also intervenes. The Irish government has come out against the takeover and said it would 
not sell its Aer Lingus shares to Ryanair. Going against a member state government so directly would be a big call 
for the commission, and one it would generally avoid.
Boardroom: Ryanair bid has reached 11th hour
It is not inevitable that it will block the bid, but the odds remain that it will, unless O'Leary and Walsh can really 
come up with something persuasive.
So where does this leave Aer Lingus? Its two main shareholders are now at odds. The government has already 
committed to selling its 25 per cent stake as part of the EU/IMF deal, and Ryanair holds just under 30 per cent. 
O'Leary would almost certainly appeal a negative decision to the European Court of Justice, which could take a 
couple of years to decide and he could deploy new Boeing planes -- which he is reportedly considering ordering -- 
to compete more aggressively with Aer Lingus.
What would O'Leary do with his Aer Lingus stake? Who knows, but the key thing to understand is that the stake 
itself is not hugely financially relevant to a massive airline like Ryanair. Taking the whole of Aer Lingus would, of 
course, be a big move for Ryanair in a lot of ways, but if the deal falls through, it has plenty of other fish to fry.
But what of Aer Lingus? Etihad, the Middle Eastern airline, is the only airline openly interested in buying a minority 
stake (EU rules forbid it having more than 50 per cent). Aer Lingus is profitable now, but against upped competition 
from Ryanair and in a world where airlines are consolidating fast, what would be its prospects?
Of course, the most logical buyer of Aer Lingus, if Ryanair turns it down, is none other than Walsh's IAG. And this 
bid process, after all, has shown that he remains interested in routes out of Ireland and in getting hold of the Aer 
Lingus slots at Heathrow.
Even if the Ryanair bid falls, the future of Aer Lingus will (with apologies) still be up in the air.
.........................
**A good week, but keep the perspective**
The government's decision to sell its convertible notes in Bank of Ireland to private investors has generated a bit of 
debate. By selling the notes, the government is taking in EUR 1 billion in cash, but giving up a 10 per cent interest 
rate return over the remaining life of the notes, which mature in 2016.
Why not hold on and take the interest rate return, critics ask, as this return of EUR 100 million a year would be 
greater than the cost of raising that amount in national debt, say EUR 35 million. The state would still be entitled to 
its capital back from Bank of Ireland when the notes expire.
It's a legitimate argument, but in my view, the state was right to sell. The key is that, if something goes wrong in 
Bank of Ireland, these notes get converted into more equity and the state is again on the hook for more of whatever 
losses emerge.
Now, hopefully, this won't happen, but it could and it seems to me sensible to reduce our massive national 
investment in the banks, pay down a bit of our enormous debt and let someone else take this bit of the risk. The 
state still holds equity and preference shares in Bank of Ireland and is in control of the other two main lenders -- 
more than enough exposure, I would have thought, to any upside, as well as any downside.
That said, our politicians and senior officials need to be careful in selling the Irish message. Patrick Honohan, the 
governor of the Central Bank, opined last week that the markets were not rewarding us for progress on reducing our 
deficit. I would think, on the contrary, that with a debt ratio of 120 per cent-plus, a deficit last year of 8 per cent and 
no deal done yet on our historic bank debt, their willingness to lend us money at an annual rate of just over 3.25 per 
cent was fair enough.
Meanwhile, the general public looks on with some bafflement at the contradiction between the flat domestic 
economy and the rosy view being taken of Irish prospects abroad. A friend who works in Germany emailed last 
week in some astonishment at the positive view there of Ireland -- which wasn't far off expecting some kind of return 
of the Celtic tiger years.
Boardroom: Ryanair bid has reached 11th hour
The reality is that we will need three things to get back into the markets next year: first, some kind of debt deal, 
secondly some kind of pick-up in growth and thirdly, some kind of luck.
The deals done last week -- to raise national debt and sell the bank holdings -- were a sign that investors are now 
willing to bet some money on our prospects, but we need to hold off 'turning the corner', 'out of the woods' or 'light 
at the end of the tunnel' talk for a while yet.

Manchester Airports Group hopes to boost transatlantic routes over the next year as it seeks to build on recent 
traffic growth provided by low-cost and Middle Eastern carriers.
Neil Thompson, chief financial officer of MAG - which owns East Midlands and Bournemouth airports alongside 
Manchester, the UK's third-biggest by passenger numbers - yesterday said that the company's 2 per cent rise in 
passenger traffic in the six months to October was driven by budget and Gulf carriers.
But he added: "There is absolutely opportunity in the transatlantic market for us, and we'll be working hard with the 
US carriers to broaden out in America next year."
MAG is also talking to Asian carriers about new routes. "We think they are slightly longer-burn opportunities," Mr 
Thompson said.
Sales at MAG rose at a steeper rate than passenger numbers in the half-year, pushed up by car-parking revenues 
and new retail offerings.
The airport group, which is owned by 10 local councils, reported underlying operating profits of £63m on interim 
sales of £230m.
Take-off and landing charges were held "broadly steady", although the company offered deals to airlines willing to 
make use of non-peak time slots or commit to year-round rather than summer-only routes.
MAG predicted it would continue to outperform the UK airport market in spite of a bearish view of the economy in 
2013. "We've grown in the past 18 months with no help from [gross domestic product]," said Mr Thompson. "Do we 
think we'll get much help in the next 12 months? We're not banking on it."
While he pointed out that the southeast of England was likely to lead any recovery, he declined to comment on the 
auction of Stansted airport , for which MAG is considered the leading bidder.
Manchester airport looks across Atlantic TRAVEL & LEISURE
Its chances were boosted on Tuesday when it emerged that a rival consortium led by New Zealand investor 
Morrison & Co had pulled out.
With final bids due mid-month, Heathrow airport Holdings, Stansted's owner, is now facing the prospect of moving 
forward with just two bidders. Macquarie, the infrastructure fund, plans to put in a final offer though it has not said 
how it would finance the bid. MAG said the funding for its bid, in partnership with Australia's Industry Funds 
Management , was "very well organised and prepared".
A group of Malaysian investors has also reportedly expressed interest in Stansted. One person close to the auction 
said some investors had been scared off by Stansted's dependence on Ryanair, whose customers represent two-
thirds of all the airport's traffic.
MAG might be better positioned than others to negotiate with Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, given its 
extensive dealings with the airline at its airports.

Corporate indigestion is as unpleasant as too many mince pies on Christmas day. So yesterday's denial by Air 
France-KLM of talks to buy more shares in Italy's Alitalia - where it has held a 25 per cent stake since 2009 - should 
be welcomed. The Franco-Dutch carrier has plenty on its plate as it tries to stabilise finances and cut unit costs and 
fleet. Admittedly, there could be extra synergies from a tighter tie-up with the Italian airline medium-term. But now is 
not the moment to take on more politically sensitive downsizing in another recession-hit country.
True, investors might be tempted to look at Air France-KLM's share price and assume that all is already hunky-dory. 
The stock has doubled from about EUR3 in June when overhaul plans were delineated and has outperformed the 
European airline industry by 50 per cent over the past year. But on an enterprise value to 2013 earnings basis, Air 
France-KLM now trades at a premium to the sector. That looks premature, leaving no room for error in a 
restructuring designed to return the lossmaking carrier to a 6-8 per cent operating margin - only in line with peers - 
by 2015. Net debt fell from EUR6.5bn at end-2011 to EUR6bn by September, but needs to come down to 
EUR4.5bn by end-2014. More than 1,000 full-time equivalent jobs have been shed at Air France, from 2011's 
72,000. The 2014 target, though, is under 66,000.
Moreover, while Europe's low-cost carriers have remained disciplined in terms of capacity, they are not about to 
give bigger rivals an easy ride. KLM's strategy includes expansion in Scandinavia, where LCCs, including Ryanair, 
pose strong competition. Yesterday easyJet, which has been expanding regional bases in France, posted 6.7 per 
cent passenger growth for 2012: Ryanair, 4 per cent. (Load factors were stable or higher). Full-cost rivals with much 
work to do may struggle to land smoothly.

THE CHRISTMAS getaway has pushed up ticket sales at some of the country's biggest airlines, according to 
figures out yesterday.
EasyJet said traffic rose 4.9 per cent on a year ago to 4.34m in December. Its load factor - a measure of how much 
the firm fills its planes - rose 2.3 percentage points to 87.9 per cent.
The figures mean EasyJet carried 59.2m passengers during 2012, up 6.7 per cent on the previous year.
Ryanair carried nearly 80m passengers last year, it revealed in figures also out yesterday. In December the budget 
airline attracted 4.84m passengers, up two per cent on last year, with a load factor of 81 per cent.
For the year, Ryanair carried 79.6m passengers, a rise of four per cent.
Irish rival Aer Lingus posted a 7.2 per cent traffic increase to 734,000 for the month. The Dublin-based firm carried 
10.66m passengers in the year - a rise of 3.8 per cent.
British Airways parent firm IAG fared less well, as Spanish arm Iberia continues to suffer from tough economic 
conditions and a fierce union dispute.

Despite what it called "massive challenges" in the aviation industry, Ireland West Airport Knock's latest traffic 
figures show that 2012 was its busiest year in its 26 year history.
In 2012, the annual number of passengers using Ireland West Knock increased by over 30,000 to 685,000 - an 
increase of 5pc on 2011 numbers.
The Airport now serves over 25 International destinations and is served by five of Europes biggest airlines.
In 2012 Ireland West Airport Knock opened up access to seven new European markets, with international airlines 
Lufthansa; Ryanair, Flybe, Aer LIngus Regional and Irish Tour Operator Sunway. Highlights included the 
commencement of the only direct services from mainland Europe to the West of Ireland from Dusseldorf, Milan, 
Paris, Frankfurt, and Barcelona which brought over 13,000 new tourists to the West of Ireland generating an 
estimated spend in the local economy of in the region of E7m. A recent independent study by Ernst and Young 
Economic Consultants stated that the airport supports a total of 914 jobs in the region with an overall economic 
contribution of E143m annually. The Airport predicts that the current economic conditions will continue to influence 
travel patterns in 2013 but already there has been positive new route announcements in the past couple of weeks 
with the news that Ryanair will commence a new weekly service to Malaga which starts in April. This is Ryanair's 
sixth sun destination from Ireland West Airport Knock along with their popular services to Alicante, Faro-Algarve, 
Gran Canaria, Lanzarote and Tenerife. Also recently announced Sunway confirmed a new weekly service to Palma 
Majorca will start in June. This is the second service Sunway will operate from Ireland West Airport Knock along

Make your money work
Make your money work
Sunday Business Post

Section: MARKETS
Length: 1746 words
Body
While the whole country is supposed to be broke, it clearly isn't. There remains a sizeable multibillion euro pot of 
money held by individuals who are desperately looking for somewhere to place it in 2013. Just two years ago, they 
were looking for somewhere safe to put their money. Now they want somewhere safe, but with some decent chance 
of making a return.
The performance of some investment categories in 2012, depending on when you bought, suggests there was real 
money to be made. Bottom-fishers take a risk but can do well in property, shares, commodities or even simply 
buying a small business.
**So what are the options open to the investor in 2013 and what are the pitfalls?**
**Taking stock**
When it comes to the stock market, conservative investors are supposed to look for mature, steady companies that 
pay a good dividend and will never go bust. During uncertain times, if you are going to invest in the stock market, 
you may well be told to 'buy the index' or, in other words, invest in an instrument that reflects the overall 
performance of one or more stock indices.
Yet a review of the stock market performance of Irish shares last year appears to turn a lot of conventional wisdom 
on its head. The index of Irish shares rose by 15 per cent, which is not a bad performance. But who would have 
thought that if you bought shares in a mature reliable steady company such as Kerry Group, you could still have 
seen your investment rise by 43 per cent in 2012? Or that if you bought CRH shares, the capital appreciation was 
about 0 per cent?
Equally, another steady mature and cyclical company, Smurfit Kappa Group, delivered a share price gain of 70 per 
cent last year. Independent News & Media saw its share price drop by 80 per cent.
Make your money work
Take the more risky exploration stock, Providence Resources, which delivered a staggering 183 per cent share 
price gain, while Petroneft Resources fell by 67 per cent.
It is quite extraordinary that blue-chip solid Irish companies, such as Glanbia, DCC and Ryanair, whose share 
prices climbed by 77 per cent, 35 per cent and 41 per cent respectively, could deliver such spectacular gains at a 
time of apparent economic uncertainty and crisis.
A set of nine stock predictions for 2013 from the British Daily Mail included two Irish companies: United Drug, and 
Providence Resources. Mind you, the Daily Mail team had a pretty bad year in 2012, with their predictions gaining 
just 1 per cent compared to a 7 per cent Ftse 100 gain.
If anything, there is more optimism around international markets at the start of 2013 than there was a year ago. 
Ireland's improved international standing might tempt more international buyers, but optimism itself will not deliver a 
return.
If you are going to invest in Irish stocks in 2013, betting on the index might well be a safer bet this year. It is hard to 
envisage similar share price gains from the likes of Kerry, Ryanair or Smurfit Kappa again in 2013 as they delivered 
in 2012.
If you are looking for a higher risk, the exploration sector is likely to do well again, but picking the wrong stock can 
be really costly.
Irish companies with solid track records but retaining a good upside story include: Paddy Power, which is building in 
markets such as Italy and has its eye closely fixed on positive regulatory developments in the US; Glanbia, which 
has enjoyed a huge bull run but is hungry for further growth and is made all the more attractive by the partial 
disposal of its dairy business in Ireland; building products company Kingspan, which was trading at just over EUR 3 
four years ago and is now above EUR 8.
But, of course, the performance of Irish stocks will be influenced by the performance of markets internationally. In 
the US, analysts are quite upbeat about 2013, with expectations of a 10 per cent gain this year quite commonplace. 
The exuberant start to the year on Wall Street on the back of deal to avert the 'fiscal cliff' is starting to fade.
As the deal is digested, it is becoming apparent that there are still huge aspects of the US exchequer finances still 
to be agreed. A deal in March will probably lead to another 'pump and dump', as the implications of the deal are 
then digested once again. Economic tightening in the eurozone is likely to dampen market performance nearer to 
home and that could also have an impact.
.........................
**House bound**
Irish property prices have fallen by 50 to 60 per cent since the peak, depending on whose figures you use. In a way, 
it is an irrelevant number. If you are interested in buying a residential property to rent it out, access to finance, rental 
yield and then capital appreciation are what count.
I am hearing more stories from people who actually avoided becoming buy-to-let investors during the boom but who 
are thinking about buying a house in Dublin right now.
They are older and can raise the money to buy. They are looking at current rental yields of between 6 per cent and 
8 per cent on some properties in the capital. They don't think prices will fall much more, if at all, and will do fine over 
the longer term.
This looks like a pretty good financial argument if you have the money or can raise the money relatively easily. It 
also makes more sense if you look at Dublin and avoid buying in mid-sized towns in the midlands. One possible fly 
in the ointment is the banks themselves. They are coming under increasing pressure to move against landlords in 
trouble, either by grabbing their houses and selling them, or by writing off a chunk of the debt.
Make your money work
If the banks move this year and don't do many deals, we could see a glut of residential investment properties 
coming on the market in a year's time.
That could have a very depressing influence on prices. However, if it's rent and yield you are primarily after, there 
are lots of people looking to rent, and rents have risen and are at least stable at current levels, after tumbling just 
after the crash.
It is worth considering if you can do it without stretching yourself and are willing to wait for your capital gain.
.........................
**Commercial adventures**
Commercial property is such a broad area and includes everything from a tiny unit in an industrial estate to a major 
office block or shopping centre.
By and large, commercial property prices in Ireland have tumbled by close to 50 per cent from the peak. There are 
few buyers. Most of the buyers emerging in the office market in Dublin are from abroad. The top end of that market, 
ironically, seems to be improving. Plus, there does seem to be more activity in the commercial property market in 
terms of actual deals being done.
But it isn't for the faint-hearted. A shop in a rural town is only as good as the tenant. The same applies for a major 
office block. However, there are other aspects to it. Firstly, there are tax breaks involved. You can enjoy the benefits 
of any capital gain on the disposal of the property after seven years tax-free. If you are an international investor or 
an Irish one and get some good tax advice, you can invest in commercial property through a real estate investment 
trust (Reit), and enjoy zero tax on the dividends and capital gain it pays out. This is a government initiative to 
encourage commercial property purchase activity. It hasn't been a major factor, but if Nama begins parcelling 
groups of properties into Reits for investors, the tax benefits could make it a little more attractive.
But don't expect to see serious price gains in the value of industrial units, retail units, office blocks in Irish towns any 
time soon.
.........................
**Stick it in the bank**
You could, of course, play it completely safe and put your money on deposit in the bank. But is that completely 
safe? At this stage in the eurozone crisis, it feels a lot safer than it did just two years ago. Interest payments are dire 
at between .03 per cent and maybe up to 2.75 per cent for very specific terms and conditions.
When you add on the extra Dirt from December's budget (an increase of 3 per cent to 33 per cent), it isn't worth 
your while keeping it on deposit as an investment proposition.
Bear in mind inflation is running at around 1.2 per cent. If you want to hold on to your money, deposit it. But if you 
want it to grow, you will have to do something else.
.........................
**The land, Tadhg, the land!**
Land prices were one of the first asset classes to show some signs of recovery after the massive economic crash. 
Prices plunged from about EUR 20,000 an acre in 2007 to EUR 8,000 an acre in 2010. Then they started to rise 
again.
They were showing gains of 9 per cent in the first six months of 2011 and have done well since. Investors began to 
feel land was safer than the banks as a home for their money.
Make your money work
Land price rises also coincided with a resurgence in food prices and the agricultural sector in general. However, if 
you are not a farmer, then what will you do with it? Renting it out brings in a reasonable income but doesn't 
necessarily finance the purchase. Emotional attachments come into play about where people are from. Plus land 
doesn't change hands that often, so it can be difficult to get your hands on it.
If you don't plan to live on it or work it, land purchase is probably one way of trying not to lose money, but it is 
probably best left to the farmers, who know what they are at.
.........................
**Bonding with your money**
Probably one of the most solid and old-fashioned ways of investing or saving your money, government bonds are 
delivering a return of between 2.25 and 3 per cent. It's a lot better than a deposit account. It is always worth 
considering, but is just not very exciting.
.........................
**Goldeneye, silver lining**
If you wanted to make a fortune buying gold, you have probably missed the boat. Gold prices fell from record highs 
in 2011 having climbed steadily for over a decade. Current levels are off record highs at around $1,669 per ounce, 
but the precious metal has held on steadily enough.
Gold investment's biggest promoter in Ireland, Gold Core, has always argued that it has its rightful place as part of 
a balanced portfolio of investment.
However, it does seem to be pretty hot on silver at the moment, with some predictions that it could rise by as much 
as 29 per cent in 2013.
It's a shiny proposition, but many investors would prefer to stick with a share in a firm that they know and that they 
believe they can read a little better than something as distant as global silver prices.

Ryanair is considering placing an order for 200 more jets, which are likely to be for 737-800s. The carrier's CFO,

Speaking at the 15th Global Airfinance Conference, Howard Millar,CFO, Ryanair, says that the Irish low cost carrier 
has no intentions to break into the transatlantic route.
Millar says the advantages Ryanair can offer on shorter routes in terms of costs are not achievable due to high fuel 
prices and high aircraft costs.
"Can we get cheaper fuel or cheaper aircraft? Probably not," Millar says.
Millar added that transatlantic flights relied on the premiums gained from having a business class, and he did not 
envisage changing his business model anytime soon.

including B787s and B747-8s.
Body
US Ex-Im could use pre-funded bonds to help finance B787s and B747-8s as early as this year.
Speaking at the Capital Markets Day at Airfinance Journal's Dublin conference, US Ex-Im's vice president, 
transportation division, Bob Morin stated the ECA was open to funding newer Boeing model types using this type of 
guarantees.
To date the ECA has issued eight prefunded bonds to finance 737s, 747s and 767s to Latam, Ryanair, ILFC and 
Emirates, all in 2012.
Morin stated that the ECA had deliberately avoided using the pre-funded bond guarantees for newer Boeing aircraft 
to avoid any delay in deliveries, sticking to older models. However, the ECA is exploring the possibility of doing pre-
funded bonds to support the deliveries of the newer aircraft.
Morin also stated that there had been an interest from airlines in issuing floating rate pre-funded bonds and hinted 
that the market may see a floating pre-funded bond, backed by US Ex-Im, over the next two months.

Tourism chiefs will target specific sections of the British holiday market next year with campaigns that involve 
increased social media marketing and less spending on TV adverts.
Figures released last Friday by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation (ITIC) showed a drop of 4 per cent, or 
100,000, in the number of British visitors who came here this year. Around 44 per cent of the 6.5 million visitors to 
Ireland in 2012 -- more than all the markets of continental Europe combined -- were British.
The ITIC's chief executive, Eamonn McKeon, said there would be much greater use of Facebook and Twitter 
marketing of Ireland next year, as well as more adverts in cinemas.
"There will be limited TV advertising around St Patrick's Day, and the 'greening' of monuments in Britain is a form of 
free advertising in itself," he said. "But we are looking to capture more markets, like the under-35s who like to take a 
city break at short notice and pack a lot in. We will be highlighting compact cities like Dublin and Cork, biking in the 
Wicklow mountains or taking a train to a seaside village like Howth."
Other target markets, according to McKeon, include the "huge number" of walkers who currently go to Cumbria and 
the Lake District, and families with children who travel with their cars.
McKeon said that the industry had been "lazy" in the past when it came to building markets like Germany, but that 
this was changing. While he believes British visitor numbers can increase by 6 per cent in 2013, the markets he is 
most bullish about are North America and Canada.
"By peak summer next year, there will be 19 large jets landing in Ireland every day from US destinations -- that is 
remarkable," he said. "We have recovered earlier in that market than expected, with almost one million visitors in 
2012, but I expect double-digit growth next year." McKeon said that, while he was "full of admiration for all Michael 
O'Leary has achieved", the Ryanair boss's business model "doesn't suit the development of tourism", because most 
US and long-haul visitors who come to Ireland connect through a hub.
ITIC to use new media to target British tourists
McKeon said that, while the Gathering tourism initiative was "nothing to get too precious about", it was a hook to get 
people to visit Ireland, and should be repeated every four years.
"The Scottish are repeating their Homecoming event next year and, in the same way, we think the Gathering is 
something that could be further developed in the future," he said.

Highlight: The country's efforts to harness family connections have also drawn criticism, writes Jamie Smyth
Body
Promising a "festival of ginger-loving madness", the Redhead Convention in the village of Crosshaven on Ireland's 
southeast coast is one of hundreds of events next year bidding to lure home the country's 100m-strong diaspora.
"Ireland has one of the highest populations of redheads in the world and we will celebrate by getting as many 
together as possible," says Alan Hayes, crowned king of the redheads this year. Competitions will include best red 
eyebrows, longest red hair, a carrot tossing championship and the popular "most freckles per square inch".
For centuries Irish men and women have fled poverty, unemployment and famine to make new lives abroad. Now, 
as the country faces economic crisis, Dublin is asking its diaspora to help with the recovery.
On New Year's eve, one of the biggest tourist initiatives in Irish history will begin with a huge fireworks display in 
Dublin, marking a year-long invitation to people with Irish connections to visit the country.
"Our target is to attract an extra 325,000 overseas visitors," says Jim Miley, the project's director. "There are also 
corporate events aimed at pushing out the message that Ireland Inc is a good place to invest."
The initiative, branded The Gathering , is attempting to reverse a sharp decline in overseas visitors travelling to 
Ireland since its economic crisis struck in 2008.
In the past the Irish diaspora has played an important role in charitable fundraising, encouraging inward investment 
and even providing political clout to Dublin for the Northern Ireland peace process. The Gathering marks Ireland's 
most explicit attempt yet to boost "genealogy tourism", where tourists can trace ancestral roots in their country of 
origin.
Redheads of the world unite as Ireland gathers its diaspora Genealogy tourism
The Gathering includes more than 2,500 events, including some established festivals such as St Patrick's day. But 
many of the attractions will be local get-togethers and reunions of sports clubs or schools, and there are slightly 
wackier events such as the redhead convention and the Left Hand festival in Mullingar, both in August.
In County Sligo, people will scale the rocky Benbulben mountain to take part in a choreographed "message of 
hope" inspired by the poetry of W.B. Yeats.
Dublin is focusing on tourism as a sector vital to creating jobs and tackling an unemployment rate of just under 15 
per cent. Last year, it cut value added tax on tourism and it has introduced a visa waiver scheme to make it easier 
for non-European tourists to enter the country.
But at a time when 87,000 people a year are emigrating from Ireland to escape the economic crisis, The Gathering 
is also stoking controversy from critics who accuse Dublin of neglecting its emigrants.
Outspoken Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary recently labelled The Gathering as "the grabbing". Irish actor Gabriel 
Byrne, who previously served as a cultural ambassador for Ireland, said the project was a "scam".
"Most people don't give a shit about the diaspora except to shake them down for a few quid," Mr Byrne told Irish 
radio.
Dublin, which is spending EUR5m promoting The Gathering, is confident, nonetheless. It cites its recent success in 
hosting the opening match of the US college football season this year between Notre Dame and the US Naval 
Academy. About 35,000 fans travelled from the US to see the match.
"About a third of the extra visitors will come from North America and it is very encouraging that we have already 
negotiated a 16-20 per cent increase in airline capacity on US routes," says Mr Miley.
Rejecting criticism of the event, Dublin says it is reaching out to Irish emigrants by funding Irish centres and Gaelic 
sports clubs abroad.
Leo Varadkar, Ireland's tourism minister, replies: "I thought it was a bit rich of Ryanair, which is extremely profitable. 
I'm sure they don't make profits of EUR500m a year out of generosity to tourists."

Ireland's Iseq index had a bumper year in 2012 and was up 17 per cent year to date by close of business on Friday. 
The success of Ireland's booming food industry was a key factor ensuring that the Irish Stock Exchange performed 
ahead of many other indices.
When drugmaker Elan's share price, a poor performer this year and a heavyweight stock in the index, is stripped 
out, the Iseq has seen a rise of about 20 per cent despite 2012 being a year when economic turbulence continued. 
By comparison, the FTSE World Index was up about 14 per cent.
"This year has been an incredible year for the Iseq and it has way outperformed other indices in Europe," said Ross 
McEvoy, an analyst with Merrion Stockbrokers. "The food stocks have been the real star performers and have now 
taken the place of the banks as the key components in the Iseq."
Glanbia was the star performer in this sector, up 77 per cent for the year, driven by the spin-off of its milk production 
into a new joint venture. Kerry was up 43 per cent, largely because of the internationalisation of its business and the 
fact that it can provide 6 per cent earnings growth in the teeth of a recession, said McEvoy.
Other food-related high performers were Fyffes, up 53 per cent, C&C, up 57 per cent, and Total Produce, up 51 per 
cent.
Other Irish companies that performed very strongly included Smurfit Kappa, up 91 per cent, Providence Resources, 
up 170 per cent, Aer Lingus, up 69 per cent, C&C, up 57 per cent, and Ryanair and Paddy Power, both up 41 per 
cent.
The major stocks that fell were Elan, down 27 per cent, and CRH, although the latter has staged something of an 
end-of-year rally, and is now up just under 1 per cent.

Section: COMMENT
Length: 430 words
Body
The government's decision to say it would not sell its stake in Aer Lingus to Ryanair raises two obvious questions -- 
who will it sell to, and on what terms? When you are trying to get the best price for an asset, it doesn't seem entirely 
wise to rule out one buyer, yet the government appears to have felt that it could not live with the Ryanair bid. It 
believes this would damage competition on airline services in and out of Ireland and endanger jobs.
While purporting to react to information "in the public domain", the government has access to Ryanair's full 
proposals to maintain competition following its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus, as the EU Commission has 
circulated these to all interested parties. The government's refusal to sell has damaged this bid, but it has not sunk 
it. If British Airways and Flybe -- the two airlines which have committed to come into Ireland if the takeover is given 
the go-ahead -- are prepared to stick with it, then it will be up to the EU Commission to decide. If it gives the green 
light, then Ryanair can still win majority control of Aer Lingus, once it can persuade shareholders with holdings of 
just over 21 per cent to sell to it. Of course, the EU may still decide to block the bid -- we should have an indication 
early in January on its views.
The difficulty for the government is that the status quo cannot be maintained in the long term. It has committed to 
sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus as part of the EU/IMF programme. The other significant shareholder in Aer 
Lingus is, of course, Ryanair itself. If its bid is blocked, then we must presume that Ryanair's stake may also be on 
the block. So far, the only other airline to express an interest in Aer Lingus is Etihad, though it would not be able, 
under EU rules, to buy a majority stake. It would probably be interested in the government stake or the Ryanair 
stake, but -- given stock exchange rules and other restrictions -- not both of them.
In this light, an "anyone but Ryanair" strategy is a dangerous one for the government. Ministers are right to be 
concerned about competition and service levels, but they also need to realise Ryanair's key role in the Irish market 
and their own limited negotiating power as a minority shareholder with a commitment to sell -- and a limited field of 
potential buyers.
Caught between a rock and Ryanair
The likelihood is that the ownership register of Aer Lingus will change fundamentally over the next year and that this 
will have a significant impact on the company's strategy. The only questions are who the new owners will be and 
what they will plan to do.

The spin last week when the government said it would not sell its 25 per cent shareholding in Aer Lingus to Ryanair 
-- even if the EU Commission approved the bid -- was that Michael O'Leary's move on the national carrier was 
"dead in water".
In truth, it is not, though it needs to overcome two significant hurdles. One is that the two airlines that have indicated 
they would step in to provide competition to a merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus -- British Airways and Flybe -- are not 
deterred by the government statement.
The chief executive of IAG, which is British Airways parent, Willie Walsh has kept his counsel after the government 
statement but, given his record in other markets, he will surely be prepared to fight on if he feels the prize is worth it. 
The second hurdle, of course, is that the EU Commission actually approves the deal, which is very much open to 
question, even given the extraordinary lengths to which Ryanair has gone to allay the commission's concerns.
The government's rejection is, obviously, a blow to the Ryanair bid. Transport minister Leo Varadkar's surprise 
statement was couched in terms of the reports of what Ryanair had offered that were already in the public domain. 
However, the minister and his colleagues have the full details because the EU Commission has circulated them for 
comments from interested parties. The government had been expected to await the commission's ruling, but its pre-
emptive strike appears to reflect a fear that competition out of Irish airports would be seriously damaged by the 
takeover and that, sooner or later, Michael O'Leary would all but control the Irish skies.
The EU Commission has similar fears. Because of this, the initial plan which Ryanair put forward to address 
competition concerns after it lodged its bid during the summer was roundly rejected by the EU Commission in a 
statement of objections.
As the two airlines would double up on more than 40 routes out of Ireland and as the Commission had blocked a 
similar bid in 2007, it was clear that Ryanair was always going to face an uphill battle to get competition clearance. 
However, what Ryanair appears to have done is to take the EU Commission objections and seek to answer them 
It's up in the air for Ryanair
with a fresh package to introduce new competition to a merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus, going well beyond what it 
promised the first time around (see panel).
Will this be enough? Many analysts and commentators remain sceptical. Yet the commission now has to go through 
the formal process and is now considering responses from interested parties, including the government, other 
airlines and industry players such as travel agents. While it has until the end of February to make its ruling, it is 
likely that it will give some indication in January about whether it is seriously considering Ryanair's new plan, or is 
set again to firmly slam the door in Michael O'Leary's face.
The key issue here is the commitment of other airlines to provide competition to a merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus. 
While smaller British airline Flybe has signed up to base planes here and provide competition on some routes, there 
is one man who is now key to what happens next: Willie Walsh, the former Aer Lingus boss who now heads the 
International Airline Group (IAG), which is the parent of British Airways. Has the government's rejection of the 
Ryanair offer swayed his attitude to getting involved in flying routes from Ireland to Britain? Or is he prepared to 
stick in and -- effectively -- support O'Leary by saying he will stick to his commitments to provide new competition in 
the Irish market if the EU does give the takeover the go-ahead?
Logic would suggest that Walsh will stick with it and at least await the EU Commission ruling. Clearly, he sees that 
there is good business for British Airways on routes such as Dublin to Heathrow, and the ability to get hold of the 
Aer Lingus slot in Heathrow would be a big attraction.
Under the deal, Ryanair is proposing that Aer Lingus would give up 20 of its 24 Heathrow slot "pairs" -- effectively 
the right to land and take off in Heathrow at certain times. Initially, it is believed that the proposal would be for Aer 
Lingus to agree to lease the slots to British Airways for a period of three years, after which BA could buy them.
The government's rejection of the bid has led to some complications here. This is because, under the Aer Lingus 
articles of association, any shareholder holding 25 per cent can try to block the sale of the slots by calling an 
extraordinary general meeting of all shareholders. Walsh will, presumably, be seeking reassurance that the slots 
deal can go ahead, even if the government does not sign up to the Ryanair deal. The fact that the government has 
committed to selling its shareholding in Aer Lingus next year is obviously a factor here. If this goes ahead, then it 
will be off the share register before the actual sale of the slots becomes an issue.
The commission, for its part, will be probing the strength of the BA commitment and that of Flybe to remain in the 
market for the long-term. It will also assess the likely attitude of a merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus after initial 
commitments that it would give not to compete on certain routes run out. Central to its determination will be whether 
long-term competition can really be guaranteed if the two airlines merge. The government and Aer Lingus will 
strongly argue that it won't. However, the commission will realise that it has to follow its own rule book if it is not to 
leave itself open to its decision being overturned by the European Court of Justice in a few years' time.
Willie Walsh has shown his combative side since he took over IAG, most recently in an ongoing scrap with the 
Spanish trade unions over plans to lay off 4,500 employees or one-quarter of the workforce at Iberia, which is also 
part of the airline group. Getting into a scrap with the government here would not worry him in the slightest. The 
only issue will be whether he feels he has a chance of winning by getting EU approval.
If the EU does approve the deal, then Ryanair could get majority control if it entices shareholders with just over 21 
per cent of the equity to accept its offer. Having the government remaining as a minority shareholder would be tricky 
and would block it taking 100 per cent control, but then the government has committed to sell anyway -- just not to 
Michael O'Leary. If the EU turns down the offer, then the government stake remains for sale -- Middle Eastern 
airline Etihad is the only confirmed one interested -- and Ryanair's own stake will come on the market too.
Aer Lingus boss Christoph Mueller and chairman Colm Barrington, who now have the airline in profit, will know that, 
whatever happens, they are likely to have new owners in 2013.

The attitude of Willie Walsh -- boss of IAG, the company which owns British Airways -- is now seen as central to the 
survival of the Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus, following the government's decision during the week to reject the bid.
British Airways is central to Ryanair's proposal to the EU Commission to provide competition following its proposed 
takeover of Aer Lingus. Under the plan, it has been learned, BA would take over all existing Aer Lingus routes from 
Dublin, Cork and Shannon to Heathrow, with smaller British airline Flybe providing competition on other routes out 
of Irish airports.
Both airlines would also give commitments to fly other seasonal routes out of Dublin, Shannon and Knock.
The government's refusal to sell could complicate the planned sale of the Heathrow slots to IAG as, under Aer 
Lingus rules, any shareholder holding more than 25 per cent of the equity can seek to block such a sale. However, 
the initial plan to lease the slots to IAG for three years may still come to fruition.
If Walsh, who was formerly chief executive of Aer Lingus, decides to support the plan, there is likely to be a period 
of intense lobbying in January as the EU Commission reaches its decision on whether the takeover would be anti-
competitive.
Despite the government's rejection of the plan, Ryanair could still gain control of Aer Lingus if the commission gives 
the green light. However, the commission would have to be satisfied that BA and Flybe are committed to providing 
competition in the long term on routes out of Ireland.
IAG has declined to comment since the government decision but, with no indication that it is backing away from a 
memorandum of understanding already reached with Ryanair, the scene is set for a crunch EU Commission 
decision in the new year.
Under the plan, IAG would take control of 20 of the 24 Aer Lingus slots at Heathrow -- initially, it is thought, by 
leasing them from the Irish airline for a three-year period, with an option to buy them after that.
BA's Walsh holds key to Ryanair 's Aer Lingus bid
Walsh does not shy away from confrontation and is currently in a major row with Spanish unions over plans for jobs 
cuts at Iberia, also owned by IAG.

Looking at the William Hill King George V? Chase, it's not a surprise to see Long Run heading the market. If the 
ground stays testing then he is the one guaranteed to really stay. There are plenty of horses that have won over the 
three-mile trip, but for some like Finian's Rainbow and Cue Card it's a bit of an unknown, especially on the ground.
Riverside Theatre has won a Ryanair and was second to Long Run in this before. He'd have a chance in an open 
race. Long Run disappointed many at Haydock but he showed when he won the King George and the Gold Cup 
that he has plenty of stamina and is probably the most reliable.
I ride Darlan in the Christmas Hurdle and he's done well since he was last seen. He had plenty of entries earlier in 
the season but the ground has been heavy so we've waited. The better the ground, the better the horse you'll see 
but it's Christmas and he needs a run. The Champion Hurdle looks open, at the moment that's the plan.

give me another win.

AN OVERWHELMING majority of City women oppose quotas to encourage greater female representation on 
company boards, with most saying they are not the answer.
A survey from recruitment agency Randstad found that 94 per cent of professional women interviewed oppose EU 
plans to introduce gender quotas.
The research claimed that three in four of the high-powered women surveyed put "self-doubt" as the major reason 
why women are under-represented in the boardroom. The survey shows an opposition to European Commission 
vice-president Viviane Reding's plans for a quota of 40 per cent of women on boards.
Wolseley yesterday followed the recent lead of Hobbs and Ryanair with a new female board member.
The plumbing and builders merchant signed up Pilar Lopez, the chief financial officer of Telefonica Europe, as a 
nonexecutive director. Chairman Gareth Davis said she brings a "great deal of corporate and financial experience, 
having worked in a range of senior roles" at Telefonica and JP Morgan.

Body
The Irish government has decided to oppose Ryanair's bid to take over Aer Lingus after studying details of the plan, 
the country's transport minister said on Tuesday in a blow to the budget airline's ambitions.
The European Commission, which is probing the 694 million euro (dollar 917 million) bid on competition grounds 
and will have the ultimate say early next year, sent Ryanair a list of objections to the tie-up last month.
Ryanair has offered fresh concessions, which include an offer to sell some of Aer Lingus' landing slots at London's 
Heathrow airport to British Airways and slots elsewhere to Flybe , according to a person familiar with the matter.
"The Ryanair offer and at least the remedies that are being reported are not sufficient in our view, so we won't 
support their bid and, in addition, won't co-operate with their remedies package," Transport Minister Leo Varadkar 
told journalists. "The Commission will make its own decision, but we have given our views and they are around 
connectivity, competition and employment. We don't see any advantages for Ireland in what's being proposed and 
we see very significant potential risks." Varadkar, who reiterated the government's intention to sell its own 25 
percent stake in the former state carrier and said advisers will be appointed in the New Year, would not comment 
on what aspects of the remedies package the government opposed. When asked about the remedies package, BA, 
which is part of the International Consolidated Airlines Group, said it had signed a non-binding memorandum of 
understanding with Ryanair which is subject to EC approval as part of the review of the Ryanair-Aer Lingus deal. 
Ryanair, which already owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus, said in a statement that as Dublin owns just 25 percent of 
the once dominant airline, it has no power to block the offer, adding that it had submitted an "unprecedented 
remedies package". In its first package of concessions, Ryanair secured commitments from airlines to set up bases 
in Dublin, and said it would scrap some routes it and Aer Lingus currently fly from Ireland. The Commission blocked 
Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus in 2007. The Irish budget airline dropped a second offer in 2009. ( C )

Body
Wizz Airlines, the eastern European budget airline, is aiming to more than double its traffic by 2020, to 25m 
passengers a year, as it steals market share from legacy carriers and uses low fares to bring new customers to air 
travel.
József Váradi, Wizz's founder and chief executive, said in an interview that he expected passenger volumes to 
grow by about 10 per cent a year over the next decade - in line with the airline's performance last year and at a 
higher rate than those of more established rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet.
"The ability of the industry to stimulate new traffic has become constrained but the low-cost sector can still grow at 
the expense of the established traditional carriers," Mr Váradi said. "I think the kind of growth we are achieving 
today, even under tough conditions, can be delivered."
Wizz flew 12m passengers in the past 12 months, putting it among the top five European budget carriers by 
passenger numbers and helping it turn a profit of EUR43m in the year to March 31, on sales of EUR766m. But 
analysts point out that it has benefited from a benign competitive environment recently, with European airlines 
maintaining strict capacity discipline and pushing up prices.
A doubling of annual passengers "seems ambitious in the context of Ryanair and easyJet doing two massive new 
orders soon", said one aviation analyst who asked not to be named, referring to the two budget airlines' talks with 
aircraft manufacturers about possible fleet expansion.
"Ryanair is aiming for 130m passengers over the next decade [from 76m last year]; it's going to need to take a lot of 
short-haul European market share to do that," he added.
But Hungary-based Wizz is prepared for that onslaught, insisted Mr Váradi: "We designed our business model to 
remain effective no matter what and no matter who we have to compete with." Moreover, while Ryanair has added 
a number of eastern European bases in recent months, its growth strategy and that of easyJet is centred on 
Wizz Airlines aims to double traffic by 2020 TRAVEL & LEISURE
markets further west, leaving Wizz as the main beneficiary in the short term of the struggles of eastern European 
legacy carriers.
Mr Váradi admitted his growth ambitions would probably necessitate a public offering of privately held Wizz - though 
he said the airline's backers, dominated by German transport-focused bank DNV, were happy to wait for better 
market conditions.

Highlight: From asking managers to defer pay to fending off invective from rivals, József Váradi has had to develop 
a thick skin, writes Rose Jacobs
Body
Things were not supposed to go wrong quite so quickly. In 2004, three months after laun-ching an airline catering to 
eastern Europeans and employing the low-cost model made famous by Southwest Airlines and Ryanair, József 
Váradi had to ask his management team to work for free. It was that or go under.
Mr Váradi, a Hungarian economist who had climbed the corporate ladder at Procter & Gamble and then spent 18 
months as chief executive of Malev, Hungary's now defunct state-owned airline, had taken delivery of six leased 
aircraft for his company, Wizz Air. He was confident he could fill them: the potential customers were there and the 
proposition was right.
But he had been more relaxed about the progress of signing up passengers when he thought finalisation of funding 
arrangements with institutional in-vestors was imminent. In fact, securing the hundreds of millions of euros needed 
was taking longer than expected, and in the meantime cash was leaching out of the young business in the form of 
fuel payments, airport charges and salaries. As suppliers started talking about bills not being paid, the press 
pounced. "It was very distressing," he says. "There were articles suggesting people shouldn't book because we 
were on the brink of going bust, and I had to tell [staff] it was very uncert-ain their salaries would ever be paid."
Most of the management team agreed to delay taking their pay, and the institutional money eventually landed. Mr 
Váradi says he learnt a lesson: "You understand it's not enough to manage a business just for profit - you also have 
to manage it for cash."
That was just one of the first bumps in the road. Wizz's passenger numbers have grown strongly since launch - 
although the rise of about 10 per cent in 2012 to EUR12m was a little less than in previous years. In 2010 the 
company broke even, thanks to a change in the way it accounted for maintenance costs. It swung to a loss again 
last year, but produced pre-tax profits of about EUR43m in the year to March 31, on sales of EUR766m.
Wizz has expanded its fleet to nearly 40, and aims to reach 50 by 2014. In common with many other airline start-
ups, the company's aircraft are all run on operating leases rather than owned outright. But the plan is to find a better 
A bumpy ride at the controls of an airline start-up
balance bet-ween leased and owned jets, Mr Váradi says, in line with Europe's two leading low-cost short-haul 
carriers, easyJet and Ryanair.
He has learnt from his bigger rivals in other ways, too. However, he says his hands-on lessons came from Malev - 
which shut in February, long after Mr Váradi had left the company and was "a good school in how not to do 
business" - and JetBlue in the US, which he visited ahead of launching Wizz.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of his former colleagues resent his disparagement of Malev, saying he himself could 
have done more to fix the airline. One, who asked not to be named, even says he believes Mr Váradi struck aircraft 
deals in his waning days at Malev that made little sense for the flag-carrier, but would later help Wizz through the 
relationships they burnished. Mr Váradi rej-ects the notion completely, pointing out that the deals in question were 
with a different leasing company than that used by Wizz.
Sipping coffee in a hotel bar in London's Mayfair, he seems unassuming and diffident compared with other captains 
of industry. However, he has had to develop a thick skin in a sector with more than its share of outspoken 
executives, such as Ryanair's Michael O'Leary . He found himself at the rec-eiving end of Mr O'Leary's invective 
this year, when Wizz and Ryanair both ratcheted up their operations in and out of Budapest in the wake of Malev's 
collapse.
"I've spent my entire career in the corporate world and I think I'm used to it," says Mr Váradi of this sort of attack. "I 
can differentiate between how people are and how they behave when they act on behalf of their company and 
therefore play a role."
It was a desire to be tested that first prompted his move into aviation and then to launch a business of his own. He 
says a change of political regime in Hungary also meant his position at Malev was no longer tenable.
Until recently, there was little reason for Ryanair to want to disparage Wizz. As recently as 2009, the two airlines' 
routes overlapped so little that some analysts have regularly asked wheth-er Wizz was positioning itself as a 
takeover target.
Mr Váradi rejects the idea but ad-mits the two operations would mesh in areas other than network. Like Ryanair, 
Wizz flies mostly from secondary airports, has a non-unionised workforce and eschews the not-ion of chasing 
business travellers. On luggage policies, Mr Váradi ap-pears even to have outdone Mr O'Leary: Wizz Air 
passengers pay EUR10 for carry-on bags that Ryanair would fly for free; the only free luggage Wizz Air allows must 
fit under the seat.
"We try to deliver this business at the lowest possible cost," says Mr Váradi.
Industry insiders who have sat op-posite Mr Váradi in negotiations, but who decline to be named, say he is just as 
willing as Mr O'Leary to walk away from, say, an airport if it does not offer him the deal he wants. Yet his style is 
considerably less brash, even solicitous - a quality he wants reflected in frontline employees. "A customer is not a 
pain to us. We think the customer is someone that we profit from, so that person deserves some care," he says.
He hopes that approach will help Wizz continue to grow in its existing markets, where he still sees opportunities - 
particularly if and when governments stop propping up ailing state carriers - as well as to expand geographically. 
Wizz recently launch-ed a route to Kutaisi, Georgia's second-biggest city and now the easternmost point in the 
airline's network.
While he says there are no specific long-term passenger targets, Mr Vár-adi sees Wizz carrying 25m or more 
people a year by 2020 - and admits that by then, it is much more likely than not to be a publicly listed airline. For 
now, though, he says his investors - including Frankfurt-based DVB Bank, Indigo Partners in the US, and wealthy 
individuals - are being patient as they wait for better market conditions.
If the challenges of rivals' invective, government-backing for state-owned airlines or disappointments in new 
markets ever seem too much he re-members that, as an employee, he had craved the heat and light that entre-
A bumpy ride at the controls of an airline start-up
preurship might bring. "At Procter & Gamble, you're always just a part of a mach-ine," he says. He remembers 
realising that "if you have a bit of an ambition to test yourself, you need to get into a different environment".

Getting off the ground 
József Váradi's tips for launching a business and expanding it 
  Hire managers who are smart , even though they are not from the industry you are operating in. "At Wizz, I 
wanted people who could really analyse business models and markets. Later, we brought in operations experts."
  The second round of fundraising can be the hardest, especially if you come up against new barriers. "It was easy 
to find angel investors who together put in about EUR3m, but European foreign ownership rules limited the scope of 
our search in the next round, when we were seeking tens to hundreds of millions of euros."

The Irish government has decided to oppose Ryanair's bid to takeover Aer Lingus, transport minister Leo Varadkar 
said yesterday. The country holds a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, and can scupper Ryanair's (EURO)694m 
(£565m) approach for the firm. The bid is being probed by the European Commission. "The commission will make 
its determination in its own time but what is the case is that the government isn''t supporting the bid,"

Ireland rejects latest Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus

Body
The Irish government announced Tuesday it won't sell its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus to Ryanair because a 
merged airline would be likely to undermine competition and jobs at the former state carrier.
The decision by Ireland's full Cabinet makes it harder for Dublin-based Ryanair, the biggest budget airline in 
Europe, to acquire its main Irish competitor. But in a typically defiant response, Ryanair said it still expected to take 
over Aer Lingus and didn't need the cash-strapped government's support to do this.
Ryanair is Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake. Aer Lingus is suing Ryanair in an effort to force 
its rival to divest. In June, Ryanair launched its third hostile takeover bid since 2006, offering (EURO)1.30 ($1.72) 
per share, a 38 percent premium over Aer Lingus' market value and representing a potential (EURO)170 million 
windfall for Ireland's cash-strapped government.
But Irish Transport Minister Leo Varadkar said the Ryanair offer "does not satisfy our concerns about connectivity, 
competitiveness or employment for Ireland."
The government announced its decision after European markets closed. Earlier, Aer Lingus shares rose 2 percent 
to (EURO)1.08.
Varadkar's comments reflected deep-seated concerns that the takeover would allow Ryanair to control around four-
fifths of all air links between Ireland and Britain, leaving it in position to drive up prices. Ryanair insists it would drive 
down average ticket prices and greatly expand Aer Lingus services to both continental Europe and the United 
States.
The European Commission in 2007 rejected Ryanair's initial bid on the ground that it would create an effective 
monopoly. Ryanair since has insisted the airline landscape in Europe is changing dramatically with myriad failures 
of regional airlines and huge merger deals. The commission's competition authorities are still mulling Ryanair's new 
bid.
Ireland rejects latest Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus
In its response, Ryanair said the Irish government "has no power to block Ryanair's offer" because 45 percent of 
Aer Lingus shares are held by private investors or Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts. Those trusts likewise 
oppose a Ryanair takeover because of its hostility to labor unions.
Ryanair noted that Ireland needs the money since it is trying to climb out of a 2010 international bailout and is 
supposed to sell state assets as part of its recovery agreement with European Union partners and the International 
Monetary Fund.
Varadkar said the government did want to sell its Aer Lingus shares "at the right time under the right conditions."
One other potential suitor is Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, which this year has acquired a 3 percent stake in Aer 
Lingus.

The Irish Hotels Federation (IHF) today expressed its alarm at a proposal by Ryanair that could see 20 of Aer 
Lingus' landing slots at Heathrow being sold to British Airways.
Michael Vaughan, President of the IHF called on the Government to do everything in its power to ensure the long-
term retention of the slots for routes between Irish airports and Heathrow. He expressed particular concern at the 
prospect of British Airways being allowed to re-allocate the slots for other routes after a period of three years.
Mr Vaughan stated: "One thing is clear. The Heathrow slots are of critical strategic importance to the country and 
the longterm prospects of our national tourism product. I'd be very worried about their future under Ryanair's 
proposal which would have serious long-term implications for services into Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports."
"If the slots are note secured, it's likely they will eventually be sold on or leased to international operators of long 
haul routes. This would leave Ireland without any connections to the World's largest traffic hub into Europe - which 
would be detrimental for Irish tourism," states Mr Vaughan. "It's imperative that the Government intervene to 
safeguard this vital national asset before it's too late."

BUDGET Irish airline Ryanair has announced that head of communications Stephen McNamara is resigning after 
four years of "being battered and abused by Michael O'Leary on one side and the European media on the other".
A press release sent by the airline revealed that McNamara has decided to pursue an easier life as director of 
communications for the Irish Rugby Football Union: "Stephen can expect to take far fewer hits working for Irish 
rugby than he does working for Ryanair."
The statement added that McNamara will leave Ryanair on 7 February after "an extensive round of lunches and 
dinners with his many friends and admirers in the media, all paid for by the Ryanair press entertainment budget of 
3.94."
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary praised McNamara for his service to Ryanair over the past four years and said the 
hunt was now on to recruit another brave soul to take on "the worst job in Irish PR."
O'Leary said the firm would look forward to "grooming the next candidate to take over the high profile and incredibly 
overpaid position."
Safe to say sense of irony is also a requirement.
Funnily enough, no author name appeared on the press release.

Band of Ireland has ruled out providing debt forgiveness for struggling homeowners.
The move will come as a blow to the thousands of BoI mortgage holders who are in arrears and were hoping for 
some form of debt forgiveness under the new personal insolvency laws.
Last night, the bank's chief executive Richie Boucher categorically ruled out reducing a portion of the personal debt 
of any of its customers.
Mr Boucher said the new insolvency bill which is due to go through the Dail this week to tackle fast-growing arrears 
will not prompt the bank to provide debt forgiveness to struggling customers. "It is not our money," he said. "It is 
shareholders' and depositors' money. "For the other government-owned banks, it is taxpayers' money - so it is a 
transfer of money from one group of taxpayers to another. Our first role is to responsibly maximise the amount of 
money we can recover." The Irish Independent XXXX Aer Lingus could lose all but four of its valuable landing slots 
at Heathrow airport if Ryanair succeeds in its bid for Aer Lingus, reports say today. The Dublin to Heathrow route is 
one of the busiest airline routes in Europe and the slots are worth about E400m. As part of its takeover bid, Ryanir 
has suggested it sells 20 of the 24 landing slots to British Airways, according to a report in today's Irish 
Independent. But, even if the EU does approve the takeover, Ryanair would still have to convince Aer Lingus 
shareholders and staff that it is in their best interests. Ryanair, which owns 29.8pc of Aer Lingus, is trying to secure 
regulatory approval for its third takeover bid. A Dublin company has announced it is suspending agreements it has 
with indigenous tribes in the Amazon forest following legal moves by the Brazilian authorities. Celestial Green 
Ventures announced the suspension in the wake of legal action being initiated in Brazil against a deal between 
Celestial and an indigenous group in the Amazon for the sale of carbon credits from avoided deforestation. Celestial 
Green, according to its website, is an "ecosystems conservation company specialising in the development of 
natural capital conservation projects, under a comprehensive REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and 
Forest Degradation) methodology, in the Amazonia region of Brazil". Filings in the Companies Registration Office

show Celestial, with an address at 93 St Stephen's Green, was incorporated in November 2010, and had an issued 
share capital of dollar 11 million at May 26th, 2011. The company has not as yet filed a set of accounts. Its annual 
return for May 2011 showed its chief executive, Ciaran Kelly, had the largest number of issued shares, followed by 
Dieter Huhn, Fabiola Huhn Ayala, Christoph Huhn and Wilman Ayala, all with addresses at 93 St Stephen's Green. 
A larger number of people held very small shareholdings, including director David Byrne, of Ballyfermot, Dublin, 
who described himself in the filing as a taxi driver. According to statements on the website, the company listed on 
the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2010 but decided earlier this month to leave the exchange, believing its time could 
be better spent on developing its projects. Lawsuit A federal attorney in the Amazon Brazilian state of Rondonia 
filed a lawsuit on December 11th to cancel a contract signed by Celestial and the Awo Xo Hwara indigenous group. 
As part of the deal, Celestial was to pay the local group dollar 13 million over 30 years for the rights to carbon 
credits associated with 260,000 hectares of rainforest. It is understood this is the first time Brazil has sought to sue 
entities involved in these type of deals, which are part of a still developing market. The Irish Times XXXX Ken 
Rohan's property group made a pretax profit of E1.86 million last year and paid a dividend of E3.1 million. The 
investment and property development group wrote down its property portfolio by E13.3 million in the year to the end 
of November 2011, but still had a conservative net debt ratio of 12 per cent. The group, which is 54 per cent owned 
by Mr Rohan (78) with other family members holding shares, was in a net cash position at year end when non-
recourse debt was excluded, according to the latest accounts for Airspace Investments Ltd. It had leasehold and 
investment properties of E90.8 million at year's end, of which E73 million had no attributable bank debt. It had 
development land, stock and work-in-progress of E41.9 million. The directors, in their notes to the accounts, said 
they believed the carrying value attributed to these assets was not greater than their estimated net realisable value. 
The group's pretax profit was E5.26 million in 2010. Turnover was E9.5 million in 2011, down from E13.6 million the 
previous year. Income included E1.29 million from sales and E8.27 million from rent. The bulk of the group's income

Poland's Lot airline was supposed to be ending the year with a 52m zlotys ($16.8m) net profit.
Instead, the state-owned carrier has had to rush to the treasury ministry for a handout just to keep its aircraft flying 
through Christmas.
The aid request at the beginning of last week stunned the government, which owns 68 per cent of the airline, and a 
furious Mikolaj Budzanowski, treasury minister, called for the head of chief executive Marcin Pirog, blaming him for 
the debacle.
Mr Pirog, who had served just over two years - longer than the average for Lot chief executives in recent years - 
was removed by the board.
But a simple change at the top is unlikely to save Lot.
The airline has asked for 1bn zlotys in aid, and the full amount of help could come to 1.5bn zlotys.
"This is an unbelievable sum," says an aviation expert. "The airline only has revenues of about 3bn zlotys."
He says that without an immediate cash infusion, Lot will fail to pay its bills for fuel, airport fees and salaries.
"People knew it was bad, but no one had any idea things were this bad."
Mr Pirog told a parliamentary committee this year that the airline - which lost 145m zlotys in 2011 - was on course 
to turn a profit.
All seemed well in November, when Lot staged a celebration as it became the first European airline to take delivery 
of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner.
Lot of aid to keep Polish airline aloft TRAVEL & LEISURE
Lot has put some of the blame for its troubles on a fall in business-class sales because the financial crisis is 
prompting many people to fly economy instead.
But the airline faces deeper structural problems, something with which many other small flag carriers are struggling.
Malév, Hungary's nat-ional airline, stopped flying this summer, while Czech Airlines received approval for a 
EUR100m restructuring programme from Brussels and is being touted to Korean Air and Kuwait Airways .
Lot is still trying to be a full-service airline, offering long-haul flights to destinations such as Toronto, Chicago and 
Beijing while flying shorter national and European routes.
"In this day and age, not every airline can do everything without subsidies," says Aleksander Domaradzki, 
managing partner of DGL Polska, a consultancy.
Lot faces competition at the bottom end from carriers such as Ryanair and Hungary's Wizz Air, while airlines such 
as Lufthansa siphon off higher-end Polish travellers.
The most viable solution would be to sell Lot, but a law reserving 51 per cent of the shareholding votes for the 
government makes it an unattractive partner for a potential European buyer.
The Polish government has held out hopes that Turkish Airlines or Air China might rescue the airline, but European 
Union rules barring non-member-state carriers from taking more than a 50 per cent stake in any EU airline make 
that sort of transaction unlikely.
"It seems the normal course of events is for an airline to be brought to the brink of bankruptcy before politicians 
react," says the aviation expert.
"The same happened with Belgium's Sabena, Alitalia and Austrian

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd., an Ireland-based airline company, has announced that it will launch eight new routes and 
additional flights on nine other routes from Glasgow Prestwick and Edinburgh airports in 2013, as it grows its traffic 
in Scotland by over 400,000 passengers.
Body
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "While Minister Varadkar talks, Ryanair and Scotland grow. Scotland's airports 
are lowering their charges in order to stimulate traffic, tourism and jobs growth in 2013 and Ryanair is responding 
with new routes and more flights. "By contrast here in Ireland, Minister Varadkar talks but does nothing about the 
DAA's high and rising charges, all of which are controlled by Minister Varadkar. Instead of welcoming visitors to 
Ireland in 2013, Minister Varadkar is presiding over the air travel tax and double digit cost increases at Dublin 
Airport, Iarnrod Eireann's rail fares and Bus Eireann's bus fares, all of which are controlled by Minister Varadkar's 
Department. Instead of welcoming visitors to Ireland next year, Minister Varadkar seems determined to screw them 
when they get here. "Ireland would be better served if Minister Varadkar stopped talking and started doing 
something like scrapping the travel tax and reversing the cost increases recently announced for 2013 by the DAA 
and CIE. While Scotland grows in 2013, Minister Varadkar remains the Lyon's tea of Irish politics: all talk, no

O'Leary rolls the dice with BA , Flybe deal for Aer Lingus slots

The airlines British Airways and Flybe have offered to base a sizeable fleet of planes in Irish airports, as part of an 
agreement with Ryanair to introduce new competition, if the EU Commission approves Ryanair's takeover of Aer 
Lingus.
The move would represent the biggest shake-up in Irish aviation since the arrival of Ryanair and would mean the 
new Aer Lingus giving up 20 of its 24 Heathrow slots.
The commitments are part of a fresh bid from Ryanair to get clearance to take over Aer Lingus.
British Airways would need about six planes to service the Heathrow slots and, with Flybe committing to additional 
routes, the two airlines would base at least 10 aircraft in the three Irish airports.
Services out of Irish airports would be transformed under the deal, with BA and Flybe basing aircraft in Dublin, 
Shannon and Cork, taking over many of the routes now flown by Aer Lingus.
IAG, which owns British Airways, confirmed to The Sunday Business Post that it had signed a non-binding 
memorandum of understanding with Ryanair "which is subject to European Commission approval, as part of its 
review of Ryanair's proposed takeover of Aer Lingus, and IAG board approval".
Flybe is understood to have signed a similar agreement, offering to fly about 20 routes served by a merged 
Ryanair/Aer Lingus. The two airlines are thought to have given a commitment to service the routes for at least three 
years.
IAG would take over about 20 of Aer Lingus's daily slots in Heathrow, a major attraction for it. However, critics of 
the plan are likely to argue that there will be nothing to stop IAG from using these slots for other routes after its 
initial agreement runs out.

The proposals are highly controversial, as they would involve a sizeable part of the Aer Lingus short-haul fleet 
moving to operate from continental EU airports, and the transfer of relevant jobs to these locations. While new jobs 
would be created by the entrance of the two new players here, the move would almost certainly be strongly 
opposed by Aer Lingus unions.
Last month, the European Commission turned down Ryanair's initial proposals to create new competition in the 
event of its takeover getting the green light, saying they were insufficient. However, the commission has circulated 
Ryanair's new plans to other industry players, suggesting that it is giving them more serious consideration.
The commission is examining Ryanair's EUR 694 million bid for the former state airline. The commission blocked its 
first bid for Aer Lingus in 2007 due to concerns that it would damage competition.
Despite the new offer, Ryanair may still face an uphill battle to get approval, given the long-term implications for 
competition in the Irish market.
The commission is due to deliver its verdict by the end of February, but may give an initial indication early in the 
new year.
A spokesman for the Department of Transport said the government was in favour of having several airlines with 
bases in Ireland, to retain competition and connectivity.
"The priority for government is to ensure connectivity to Ireland today, in five years' time, and in 10 years' time. The 
best way to achieve that is through a multiplicity of providers," he said.

Will Ryanair 's remedies fly?
Will Ryanair's remedies fly?

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary had two options when the EU Commission last month indicated that it had 
serious objections to his proposals for the takeover of Aer Lingus.
He could have accepted that the bid was dead in the water and let it quietly expire. Or he could offer more 
concessions to meet the EU competition concerns about the merger, in a bid to snatch an unlikely victory from the 
jaws of an expected rejection.
Perhaps not surprisingly, given his record, he has decided to fight -- and to put it up to the EU Commission with an 
unprecedented offer to try to persuade the regulators in Brussels that Ryanair can be allowed to take over Aer 
Lingus with competition being maintained on routes out of Ireland.
As we report this weekend, IAG, run by former Aer Lingus chief Willie Walsh, has signed a formal memorandum of 
understanding with Ryanair, indicated its intention to base British Airways aircraft in Ireland to fly routes formerly 
flown by Aer Lingus, if the EU approves the deal.
A similar deal is understood to have been struck with Flybe, a low-cost carrier based in Devon, which already has a 
base at Belfast City Airport.
These upfront commitments to base planes in Ireland to compete with a merged Aer Lingus/Ryanair -- if the deal 
gets the nod from the EU Commission -- are the cornerstones of the deal now being offered by O'Leary to the EU 
Commission. They are designed to overcome commission fears that nobody would be prepared to enter the market 
to compete head-on with a merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus.
The formal understandings with the two other airlines are a fresh element in the new offer of what are called 
"remedies" by Ryanair to address the EU Commission's competition concerns. Ryanair is also believed to have 
increased the number of routes out of Ireland which it would be prepared to give up as part of the deal.
Will Ryanair 's remedies fly?
In the current takeover bid, the EU Commission issued a statement of objection to Ryanair's first offer of remedies 
last month without even circulating the offer for comments from other airlines, governments and industry players. It 
would normally do this if it felt an offer should be fully considered.
It reportedly said that the initial offer did not meet competition concerns and would not deliver the promised benefit 
to consumers. However, the recently-submitted revised offer goes further, and has been circulated for comments to 
industry players.
O'Leary said last week that "when the market becomes aware the scale of the remedies we've offered are 
unprecedented in any EU airline merger . . . then clearly it must be approved".
Both IAG and Flybe airlines are understood to have committed to base planes in the three main Irish airports -- 
Dublin, Cork and Shannon. Airline industry sources believe that the number of planes involved must be significant if 
Ryanair is to have any hope of satisfying the EU Commission's competition concerns -- probably running into 
double figures.
The deal involves Ryanair offering to give up a significant percentage of Aer Lingus's current short-haul traffic to 
Britain and Europe.
Given that the two airlines compete directly on more than 40 routes out of Ireland, Ryanair would probably have to 
offer to give up between a quarter and a third of Aer Lingus's short-haul traffic, or possibly more, the sources 
believe. As part of the deal, IAG would take control of 20 of Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots, a valuable prize.
Ryanair has already indicated what it would do with the Aer Lingus planes -- and crews -- freed up by this 
divestiture of routes out of Ireland.
Its intention is to move them to big continental EU airports to compete with existing carriers on point-to-point flights 
to other city centre airports, aimed largely at the business traveller or the wealthier consumer who is prepared to 
pay more to travel to a main airport at convenient times of the day.
Ryanair believes it can compete with the carriers dominating this market, operating a separate brand from Ryanair 
and charging somewhat higher fares, although still a cheaper offering compared to existing players.
An Aer Lingus takeover would also bring Ryanair into the transatlantic market.
An analysis by Merrion Stockbrokers estimated that a takeover could boost Ryanair's profits by 8 per cent next year 
and 12 per cent by 2014, rising to about 20 per cent in five years' time. However, the scale of the remedies now on 
offer could be expected to reduce the short-term boost to profits to some extent.
While the overall number of jobs in Ireland would -- Ryanair is expected to argue -- be protected by moving in new 
planes from IAG (operating as British Airways) and Flybe, the takeover would still meet stiff opposition from Aer 
Lingus unions, as many of their members would not wish to work from airports outside Ireland.
Aer Lingus, and possibly the Irish government, may also question the level of commitment from IAG and Flybe to 
remain in Ireland and the likely long-term impact on the level of services and competition in the market.
The memorandums of understanding are likely to indicate that the new arrivals would commit to Ireland for a few 
years and that Ryanair would undertake not to open new routes out of Ireland for a similar period, but these 
commitments are likely to be questioned by other airlines. In particular, critics will say that British Airways could 
eventually use the Heathrow slots for other routes.
Neither Aer Lingus nor the Department of Transport would comment when contacted this weekend.
The likely attitude of the EU Commission to the revised proposals remains unclear. Industry sources believe that 
Ryanair is still likely to face an uphill battle to get competition clearance. A previous bid was rejected in 2007 -- and 
Will Ryanair 's remedies fly?
this decision was backed by the EU Court of Justice in 2010. The Irish government is also expected to lobby 
against the deal.
However, the commission will be aware that Ryanair has gone to great lengths to try to meet its objections to the 
deal and will be conscious of the possibility of a legal challenge if it turns down the bid.
The initial timescale on this will now be short. The industry players are likely to have been given a short time to 
respond with their views, and the commission, while it has until the end of February to deliver a final decision, is 
likely to inform Ryanair and Aer Lingus of its broad thinking early in the new year. If the bid is turned down again, 
O'Leary will have the choice to walk away or to start a legal battle to try to overturn it, which would be likely to last 
for two to three years.
If the bid is turned down, uncertainty will continue over Aer Lingus's future, with the government committed to off-
loading its 25 per cent stake.
Etihad, which currently owns 3 per cent, has indicated an interest in buying this stake but, under EU rules, cannot 
take a majority stake as it is a non-EU carrier. Aer Lingus could decide to continue as an independent airline with a 
new shareholding structure, though it could conceivably face new competition from Ryanair if the bid is turned 
down.
To complicate matters, Ryanair lost an appeal last week in Britain where it was trying to block a Competition 
Commission probe into its holding in Aer Lingus. It will appeal this to the UK Supreme Court .
So, for the moment, the EU Commission remains the one with the key call to make.
The only certain thing is that, in a short enough time, Aer Lingus will have a new shareholding structure -- either 
Ryanair will get the green light, or a government sale will spark an ownership restructuring which, if Ryanair is 
blocked, could also involve it off-loading its 29.8 per cent stake.
.........................
**The bid**
Ryanair has offered EUR 1.30 per share for Aer Lingus, valuing the airline at EUR 694 million. Ryanair already 
owns 29.8 per cent of Aer Lingus. The state has a 25 per cent stake, businessman Denis O'Brien holds 3.7 per cent 
and Etihad holds 2.99 per cent. The Aer Lingus board has said that the bid from Ryanair significantly undervalues 
the airline.

British Airways stands to strengthen its grip on Heathrow by gaining the right to buy a large chunk of take-off and 
landing slots at the airport, as part of proposals Ryanair is offering European regulators to seek approval for its 
contentious takeover of Aer Lingus.
The UK flag carrier, the largest airline at Heathrow, has struck a deal with Ryanair to buy more than 85 per cent of 
Aer Lingus' slots at the airport, which are used to provide services to Dublin, Shannon and Cork, said three people 
familiar with the deal between Ryanair and British Airways.
Heathrow is running at near full capacity, so the opportunity to buy Aer Lingus' slots at the airport could provide 
British Airways with an important means eventually to expand its long-haul services.
Ryanair is trying to secure regulatory approval for its third takeover bid for the Irish flag carrier.
Last month, the European Commission objected to Ryanair's bid on competition grounds . The commission 
prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus in 2007 and Brussels has never cleared a merger that it previously 
rejected.
British Airways is offering to take responsibility for many of Aer Lingus' services out of Heathrow for at least three 
years.
With British Airways operating these services, Ryanair is privately saying a combined Ryanair-Aer Lingus would not 
be dominant on those routes, said people familiar with the budget carrier's stance.
However, British Airways would run these services in place of Aer Lingus for between three and five years.
After that it would have the right to buy the Irish flag carriers's Heathrow slots and reallocate them to different 
destinations, such as New York.
BA eyes Aer Lingus Heathrow slots
Aer Lingus is the third-largest airline at Heathrow and British Airways would be able to purchase up to 20 pairs of 
slots for daily flights held by the Irish flag carrier at the airport.
In the same regulatory process, Flybe, the smaller UK airline that has issued four profit warnings since its 2010 
flotation, has offered to operate flights for three years on 20 routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus have services.
Without Flybe's offer, the combined Ryanair-Aer Lingus would be in a monopoly or dominant position on those 20 
routes.
The moves by British Airways and Flybe are part of a remedies package that Ryanair has submitted to the 
European Commission in the hope that the takeover bid will be approved.
International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, said: "We have signed a non-binding [memorandum of 
understanding] with Ryanair which is subject to EC approval . . . and IAG board approval."
Flybe and Ryanair declined to comment.

The ISEQ closed the week flat in line with world markets investors held off in the absence of firm leads.
The index was down 1.09 points to 3,327.69.
The European Central Bank, poised to take over supervision of the region's banks, said today there was no room 
for complacency following early signs of easing strains on financial markets. It urged governments to push ahead 
with reforms. Putting the ECB in charge of supervising euro zone banks and possibly others from the European 
Union is important to make the bloc's institutions more crisis resilient, but more needs to be done to avoid a 
renewed crisis flare-up, it said. "The situation is still very fragile in many ways," ECB Vice-President Vitor 
Constancio told reporters at a presentation of the bank's twice-annual Financial Stability Review. "Key financial 
stability risks remain and there is no room for complacency," the ECB said in the report. The main risks are a 
possible renewed intensification of the crisis if governments fall behind on their reforms, a deterioration of banks' 
health and further funding strains as money and debt markets are still not functioning properly. The banking union - 
a three-part process which involves creating a single supervisor, establishing a fund to wind down problem banks 
and fully coordinating national schemes that guarantee deposits - is seen as key to address such risks.
Shares in C and C rose 9c to E4.29. The leading US craft brewer, the Boston Beer Company, has increased its

depletions growth of 8pc to 12pc for 2012. It also lifted its 2013 volume assumptions. In 2013, the depletions 
projection range is now between 10pc and 15pc, from its previously communicated growth of high-single-digits. "On 
December 13th, C&C passed the anti-trust hurdle on the way to completing the Vermont acquisition. It received 
notification of early termination of the waiting period under the US Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act in 
relation to its proposed acquisition. Subject to satisfying the other customary conditions, it is now able to proceed to 
completion of the acquisition," said Davy Stockbrokers. Ryanair's shares were up 5c at E4.85 while Aer Lingus

The ISEQ closed the week flat in line with world markets investors held off in the absence of firm leads.
The index was down 1.09 points to 3,327.69.
The European Central Bank, poised to take over supervision of the region's banks, said today there was no room 
for complacency following early signs of easing strains on financial markets. It urged governments to push ahead 
with reforms. Putting the ECB in charge of supervising euro zone banks and possibly others from the European 
Union is important to make the bloc's institutions more crisis resilient, but more needs to be done to avoid a 
renewed crisis flare-up, it said. "The situation is still very fragile in many ways," ECB Vice-President Vitor 
Constancio told reporters at a presentation of the bank's twice-annual Financial Stability Review. "Key financial 
stability risks remain and there is no room for complacency," the ECB said in the report. The main risks are a 
possible renewed intensification of the crisis if governments fall behind on their reforms, a deterioration of banks' 
health and further funding strains as money and debt markets are still not functioning properly. The banking union - 
a three-part process which involves creating a single supervisor, establishing a fund to wind down problem banks 
and fully coordinating national schemes that guarantee deposits - is seen as key to address such risks.
Shares in C and C rose 9c to E4.29. The leading US craft brewer, the Boston Beer Company, has increased its 
expected depletions growth in 2012 to 11-13pc. In its last market update just over a month ago, it had targeted 
depletions growth of 8pc to 12pc for 2012. It also lifted its 2013 volume assumptions. In 2013, the depletions 
projection range is now between 10pc and 15pc, from its previously communicated growth of high-single-digits. "On 
December 13th, C&C passed the anti-trust hurdle on the way to completing the Vermont acquisition. It received 
notification of early termination of the waiting period under the US Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act in 
relation to its proposed acquisition. Subject to satisfying the other customary conditions, it is now able to proceed to 
completion of the acquisition," said Davy Stockbrokers. Ryanair's shares were up 5c at E4.85 while Aer Lingus

A UK probe into Ryanair's shareholding in Aer Lingus has been given the go-ahead after the low-cost carrier lost an 
appeal that the inquiry undermined a separate European Commission probe of its bid for the Irish flag carrier.
The UK Competition Commission has won the right to pursue its investigation into whether Ryanair wields undue 
influence over Aer Lingus, in which it holds a 29.8 per cent stake.
Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, calling it "a key milestone on the path toward Ryanair being required to divest its 
shareholding in Aer Lingus".
However, Ryanair said yesterday that it would ask the UK's supreme court to hear another appeal.
That move could further delay the UK Competition Commission's probe, though the regulator might also decide to 
push ahead while the supreme court considers taking on the case. Either way, the regulator would probably not 
publish its initial findings before March next year - after the European Commission is expected to rule on the 
takeover bid.
Ryanair said the UK probe contravenes the principle of "sincere cooperation" between the EU and member states. 
But that argument may be weakened by the fact that the UK Competition Commission will now report after its 
European counterpart.
The prospects of European regulators approving Ryanair's third tilt at Aer Lingus look poor. People involved in talks 
between the EU and the airline say Ryanair has been told its package of "revolutionary" remedies to competition 
concerns has fallen short .
The most recent group to consider asking the UK supreme court to hear a competition case was BAA, the airport 
operator now known as Heathrow Holdings Ltd, which was attempting to overturn a 2009 Competition Commission 
order that it sell Stansted airport.
Ryanair - Aer Lingus probe given go-ahead
But it eventually decided not to challenge the court of appeal decision , and is now in the process of selling 
London's third-biggest airport by passenger numbers.
Separately, Ryanair said yesterday that it had appointed two new directors. Julie O'Neill, former secretary-general 
of Ireland's transport department, and Louise Phelan, a PayPal executive, will both join the board, while Klaus 
Kirchberger, a Ryanair director for 10 years, is stepping down.
David Bonderman, chairman, thanked Mr Kirchberger for his service, giving the German businessman credit for 
helping guide Ryanair's "rapid growth in Germany and across much of central Europe".
Ms O'Neill is also a director of Ireland's Sustainable Energy Authority.
Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, has called environmental activists "loonies" but has not ruled out 
switching to greener fuel - "the second it becomes cheaper than traditional aviation fuel".

EUROPE'S largest budget carrier, Ryanair, yesterday lost its appeal to block an investigation into its near-30 per 
cent stake in rival Aer Lingus.
The UK's Court of Appeal ruled that it is within the jurisdiction of the Competition Commission (CC) to investigate 
Ryanair's ownership.
The CC is investigating the case after the Office of Fair Trading ruled that the stake threatens competition in the UK 
airline market, and could lead to Ryanair being forced to reduce its golding.
Aer Lingus chairman, Colm Barrington, said he was delighted with the ruling and called it a "key milestone on the 
path toward Ryanair being required to divest its shareholding in Aer Lingus".
Ryanair plans to take the rejection to the UK Supreme Court for review.
Meanwhile, Ryanair added two new board members yesterday to try and address the gender balance in its 
boardroom. Julie O'Neill, the former secretary general of the Irish Department of Transport, and Paypal exec Louise 
Phelan were welcomed to the firm yesterday.

The ISEQ slipped further in to the red this morning after figures from the Central Bank showed that mortgage 
arrears are getting worse.
The index fell 12.80 points to 3,329.68.
Latest figures from the Central Bank out today show that the number of mortgages in arrears by 90 days or more is 
growing though it says that the broader picture is one of stabilisation in the pace of increases in arrears. It found 
that there were 86,146 (11.3pc) of private residential mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDH) in 
arrears of over 90 days at the end of September, up from 81,035 accounts (10.6pc) at the end of June. Meanwhile, 
the buy-to-let (BTL) arrears problem is getting notably worse. These figures indicate that 26,770 (17.9pc) BTL 
accounts were in arrears of more than 90 days as at the end of September 2012. This figure has increased since 
end-June 2012, when 24,879 (16.6 per cent) BTL accounts were in arrears of more than 90 days. The data also 
indicate that 22,553 BTL mortgage accounts were classified as restructured as at end-September 2012.
Shares in Glanbia fell 7c to E7.68 after members of Glanbia Co-op at a special general meeting passed a resolution 
to reduce the co-op's holding in Glanbia plc to 41.4pc. Some 83pc of those entitled to vote did so in favour of the 
proposal which, because it was a change in rule, required a majority vote of 75pc. The rule change must be 
registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies (a provision of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act). 
Following this step, which is expected to be effected in coming weeks, Glanbia Co-Op will sell 3pc of its holding in 
Glanbia plc, part of the proceeds of which it will invest in the Dairy Ingredients Ireland joint venture of which it owns 
60pc - the remaining 40pc is owned by Glanbia plc. A further 7pc of the co-op's holding in Glanbia plc will be 
distributed among its members. At the meeting, members of the co-op also voted to lower to 66pc the majority vote 
required in any future proposal to reduce the co-op's holding in Glanbia plc below 38pc. Ryanair has announced

The ISEQ slipped further in to the red this morning after figures from the Central Bank showed that mortgage 
arrears are getting worse.
The index fell 12.80 points to 3,329.68.
Latest figures from the Central Bank out today show that the number of mortgages in arrears by 90 days or more is 
growing though it says that the broader picture is one of stabilisation in the pace of increases in arrears. It found 
that there were 86,146 (11.3pc) of private residential mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses (PDH) in 
arrears of over 90 days at the end of September, up from 81,035 accounts (10.6pc) at the end of June. Meanwhile, 
the buy-to-let (BTL) arrears problem is getting notably worse. These figures indicate that 26,770 (17.9pc) BTL 
accounts were in arrears of more than 90 days as at the end of September 2012. This figure has increased since 
end-June 2012, when 24,879 (16.6 per cent) BTL accounts were in arrears of more than 90 days. The data also 
indicate that 22,553 BTL mortgage accounts were classified as restructured as at end-September 2012.
Shares in Glanbia fell 7c to E7.68 after members of Glanbia Co-op at a special general meeting passed a resolution 
to reduce the co-op's holding in Glanbia plc to 41.4pc. Some 83pc of those entitled to vote did so in favour of the 
proposal which, because it was a change in rule, required a majority vote of 75pc. The rule change must be 
registered with the Registrar of Friendly Societies (a provision of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act). 
Following this step, which is expected to be effected in coming weeks, Glanbia Co-Op will sell 3pc of its holding in 
Glanbia plc, part of the proceeds of which it will invest in the Dairy Ingredients Ireland joint venture of which it owns 
60pc - the remaining 40pc is owned by Glanbia plc. A further 7pc of the co-op's holding in Glanbia plc will be 
distributed among its members. At the meeting, members of the co-op also voted to lower to 66pc the majority vote 
required in any future proposal to reduce the co-op's holding in Glanbia plc below 38pc. Ryanair has announced

that Krakow will be its fifty-third base. Krakow is the airline's fifty-third base and its second in Poland. It will launch in

Ryanair today lost its legal challenge designed to block a U.K. probe into its 30pc stake in Aer Lingus.
The airline had sought to block the investigation in to claims that it conflicts with a separate European Union review 
of Ryanair's plans to take over Aer Lingus.
The investigation into the minority stake by the U.K. Competition Commission doesn't overlap the EU's parallel 
review of Ryanair's bid in June to purchase Aer Lingus for 694 million euros, the Court of Appeal ruled today in 
London.
The judgment affirms an antitrust tribunal's ruling in August. "Only the U.K. has jurisdiction in respect of Ryanair's 
minority shareholding," Judge Terence Etherton said in the ruling. "The probe isn't a breach of the U.K.'s legal duty 
to cooperate with European regulators." The European Commission issued formal objections last month to 
Ryanair's new takeover bid, setting out possible competition concerns over the Dublin-based carriers combining. 
Ryanair plans to "immediately" refer today's ruling to the UK Supreme Court for review, the airline said in a 
statement.

Body
The ISEQ moved back in to the red today as investors awaited leads and concrete news that Ireland has managed 
to negotiate a deal on our legact banking debts.
The index was down 13.32 points to 3,342.48.
Finance Minister Michael Noonan today said a deal on Anglo debt was "likely" before the end of March with 
intensive talks in Brussels today likely to come to an agreement on banking union, which is needed if an Irish deal is 
to be done. The State is scheduled to make a E3 billion payment on Anglo promissory notes in March. Minister for 
Finance Michael Noonan says he is 'hopeful' that he and his European counterparts will reach a deal which will be 
signed off by European heads of state and government at the EU Council meeting on Thursday and Friday. Mr 
Noonan said there was good will towards Ireland on the issue, but there were still a number of legal hurdles that 
had to be overcome. He was echoing remarks by the ECB president Mario Draghi in Frankfurt last week. "I've said 
on a number of occasions that the political deadline on us is March 31 when the next payment is due, and I have 
also said that it would be very difficult for Ireland to pay the money on that date, so we're working towards a deal 
and we hope we get a deal," he said.
The Department of Finance published a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the EU/IMF. The new 
MOU includes a commitment by the government to address by end-Q1 2013, through new legislation, the legal 
loophole exposed by the Dunne judgement impeding banks from repossessing properties associated with mortgage 
loans in arrears. In Q1 2012, there were 83,000 owner-occupiers and 29,000 buy-let-investor in 90+ day arrears. 
Both the draft personal insolvency legislation and official commentary from the Central Bank suggest that banks' 
focus should be on repossessing buy-to-let loans. We expect buy-to-let arrears to continue rising in 2013, as 
investors' interest-only tracker mortgages move to principal and interest payments, to close to 40,000. However, the 
stabilisation in private sector employment since the beginning of 2011 should lead to a flattening-off in new owner-

occupier arrears. Bank shares remained unmoved Shares in Ryanair fell 2c to E4.83. The airline has announced

The ISEQ moved back in to the red today as investors awaited leads and concrete news that Ireland has managed 
to negotiate a deal on our legact banking debts.
The index was down 13.32 points to 3,342.48.
Finance Minister Michael Noonan today said a deal on Anglo debt was "likely" before the end of March with 
intensive talks in Brussels today likely to come to an agreement on banking union, which is needed if an Irish deal is 
to be done. The State is scheduled to make a E3 billion payment on Anglo promissory notes in March. Minister for 
Finance Michael Noonan says he is 'hopeful' that he and his European counterparts will reach a deal which will be 
signed off by European heads of state and government at the EU Council meeting on Thursday and Friday. Mr 
Noonan said there was good will towards Ireland on the issue, but there were still a number of legal hurdles that 
had to be overcome. He was echoing remarks by the ECB president Mario Draghi in Frankfurt last week. "I've said 
on a number of occasions that the political deadline on us is March 31 when the next payment is due, and I have 
also said that it would be very difficult for Ireland to pay the money on that date, so we're working towards a deal 
and we hope we get a deal," he said.
The Department of Finance published a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the EU/IMF. The new 
MOU includes a commitment by the government to address by end-Q1 2013, through new legislation, the legal 
loophole exposed by the Dunne judgement impeding banks from repossessing properties associated with mortgage 
loans in arrears. In Q1 2012, there were 83,000 owner-occupiers and 29,000 buy-let-investor in 90+ day arrears. 
Both the draft personal insolvency legislation and official commentary from the Central Bank suggest that banks' 
focus should be on repossessing buy-to-let loans. We expect buy-to-let arrears to continue rising in 2013, as 
investors' interest-only tracker mortgages move to principal and interest payments, to close to 40,000. However, the 
stabilisation in private sector employment since the beginning of 2011 should lead to a flattening-off in new owner-

occupier arrears. Bank shares remained unmoved Shares in Ryanair fell 2c to E4.83. The airline has announced 
the opening of two new bases in Holland and Poland due to open next year.

Commission will accept a new package of remedies offered to win approval for its bid to buy Irish rival Aer Lingus. 
The concessions to EU antitrust regulators were submitted on Friday. O'Leary said that if the proposed deal is 
reviewed "on the same basis as all other flag carrier airline mergers it's hard to see how the Commission could turn

Tales of the unexpected
Of all the aviation books out there fighting for a spot under the tree, one we really enjoyed is Out of the Blue 
(Halldale), a collection of stories subtitled: The Sometimes Scary and Often Funny World of Flying in the Royal Air 
Force, as Told by Some of Those Who Were There.
The title says it all. It's pure RAF, it's about the sky, and it's about the unexpected. It's a series of anecdotes about 
things that really happened on sorties, and they are all about things that went wrong.
If that makes it sound as if the RAF is all cock-ups, think again. These aviators lived to tell the tale - literally.
The droll way the tales are related is classic: it's like hearing them from a fellow aviator leaning against the bar in 
the officer's mess.
All proceeds from sales of the book go to Help for Heroes and the RAF Benevolent Fund.
Finland of nod
Mark Casserly was puzzled by the safety announcement on Finnair: "If you wish to sleep, please remain seated." 
Presumably, snoozing while standing up is strictly forbidden.
Eggs-tra care
Paolo Montanari spotted this very practical advice in a BAe Jetstream avionics bay - practical, that is, unless you 
can handle your eggs boiled, fried or scrambled.
Ryan it on
Tales of the unexpected.
Ryanair is calling its onboard menu - complete with "free cups, boxes and napkins" - the Getaway Cafe. The 
uncharitable might suggest a getaway often follows daylight robbery.
Polar pair
Aviation literature can tax even the most committed reader. But don't be put off by the weighty tome that is Daisy 
and Dean & Their Flying Machine go to the North Pole because this 32-page epic is a cautionary, often surreal, tale 
of the potential risks of transpolar operations.
Poor flight-planning and disregard for standard approach procedures by the eponymous crew results in a loss-of-
control and collision with terrain.
But the plot swings away from predictable Andes cannibalism territory, as the two stranded crew are traced by a 
worker from a local maintenance station.
Despite clearly suffering post-traumatic hallucinations - evidenced by references to elves on trampolines and 
machines puffing a "sparkly pink cloud" - the two are given a tour of the facility while their aircraft is upgraded with a 
mysterious navigation system of questionable regulatory compliance.
(Just kidding. It's a charming seasonal story of magic and Santa Claus, by Avolon's Vicky Goodenough, and 
illustrated by Martin Beckett. Your kids will love it.)
Le jargon
Overheard: complex technical terminology from Airbus Toulouse described as "froggledigook".
Daisy and Dean: cautionary
It's no yolk

Spanish trade unions have called off a planned six-day strike at Iberia during the Christmas period over plans to fire 
4,500 workers in a sweeping restructuring of the lossmaking carrier.
The unions will continue negotiations with the airline's management after failing to reach agreement in eight hours 
of discussion at an arbitration committee. Planned strikes on the December 14, and between the 17 and 21, were 
cancelled to avoid causing disruption to passengers as talks continued, Spanish state media reported.
Ground and cabin crew at Iberia, which alongside British Airways makes   up International Airlines Group, were to 
strike against a plan by Iberia to make almost a quarter of its workforce redundant.
That prompted Ana Pastor, the Spanish transport minister, to call for a resolution of the dispute.
Rafael Sánchez-Lozano, Iberia's chief executive, said that the strike would cause serious damage to the 
lossmaking company. Iberia has reported an operating loss of EUR262m for the first nine months of 2012.
Iberia has suffered from competition from low-cost competitors such as Ryanair at the same time as recession in its 
home market has reduced demand for short-haul air travel.
Sepla, Spain's pilots union, is not allowed to strike until a separate arbitration process with Iberia is resolved.

The ISEQ made strong gains in afternoon trading after sharp falls yesterday as markets around the world await 
news from the US on so-called "fiscal cliff" talks and after a strong showing by the Germen ZEW investor sentiment 
index.
The ISEQ was up 20.87 points to 3,355.80.
German analyst and investor sentiment rose sharply in December on the back of encouraging U.S. economic data, 
entering positive territory for the first time since May, a leading survey showed today. The Mannheim-based ZEW 
think tank said its monthly poll of economic sentiment jumped to 6.9 points from -15.7 in November, coming in well 
above the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of 41 analysts for a reading of -12.0.
Overnight, the UK RICS housing survey was released, with the net balance of respondents reporting price falls 
increasing from -7pc, to -9pc. However, two-thirds of the surveyed estate agents reported that prices remained 
unchanged on the month. So there may be more stability in UK house prices than the headline price balance 
suggests. Shares in Kingspan rose 14c to E8.27. Ryanair shares rose 6c to E4.85 as global oil prices maintained 
their narrow range and as it opened a new base in The Netherlands.

Tales of the unexpected
Of all the aviation books out there fighting for a spot under the tree, one we really enjoyed is Out of the Blue 
(Halldale), a collection of stories subtitled: The Sometimes Scary and Often Funny World of Flying in the Royal Air 
Force, as Told by Some of Those Who Were There.
The title says it all. It's pure RAF, it's about the sky, and it's about the unexpected. It's a series of anecdotes about 
things that really happened on sorties, and they are all about things that went wrong.
If that makes it sound as if the RAF is all cock-ups, think again. These aviators lived to tell the tale - literally.
The droll way the tales are related is classic: it's like hearing them from a fellow aviator leaning against the bar in 
the officer's mess.
All proceeds from sales of the book go to Help for Heroes and the RAF Benevolent Fund.
Finland of nod
Mark Casserly was puzzled by the safety announcement on Finnair: "If you wish to sleep, please remain seated." 
Presumably, snoozing while standing up is strictly forbidden.
Eggs-tra care
Paolo Montanari spotted this very practical advice in a BAe Jetstream avionics bay - practical, that is, unless you 
can handle your eggs boiled, fried or scrambled.
Ryan it on
Ryanair is calling its onboard menu - complete with "free cups, boxes and napkins" - the Getaway Cafe. The 
uncharitable might suggest a getaway often follows daylight robbery.
No Headline In Original
Polar pair
Aviation literature can tax even the most committed reader. But don't be put off by the weighty tome that is Daisy 
and Dean & Their Flying Machine go to the North Pole because this 32-page epic is a cautionary, often surreal, tale 
of the potential risks of transpolar operations.
Poor flight-planning and disregard for standard approach procedures by the eponymous crew results in a loss-of-
control and collision with terrain.
But the plot swings away from predictable Andes cannibalism territory, as the two stranded crew are traced by a 
worker from a local maintenance station.
Despite clearly suffering post-traumatic hallucinations - evidenced by references to elves on trampolines and 
machines puffing a "sparkly pink cloud" - the two are given a tour of the facility while their aircraft is upgraded with a 
mysterious navigation system of questionable regulatory compliance.
(Just kidding. It's a charming seasonal story of magic and Santa Claus, by Avolon's Vicky Goodenough, and 
illustrated by Martin Beckett. Your kids will love it.)

State hopes for an asset windfall
State hopes for an asset windfall
Sunday Business Post
December 9, 2012

Body
The government's New Era has been very slow to take off. The body responsible for policy and management co-
ordination of state companies slowly breathed into life last week. It emerged that New Era had called for tenders for 
advisers in relation to future options on the sale of the state's stake in Aer Lingus.
This is a stake that has been de facto for sale for quite some time. But inertia, political sensitivities and the takeover 
activities of Ryanair have all slowed down what should be a fairly straightforward process.
Given the major share blocks held by Ryanair and the state, the sale of the state's 25 per cent shareholding is likely 
to trigger a change of ownership at the airline. Ryanair is on its third bid to buy the business and, if it is blocked 
again, its stake may well be put on the block too.
But the sale of the EUR 140 million stake in Aer Lingus is just one of several major state assets due to be sold off.
In reality, every time a degree of momentum builds up on the issue of privatisation, it slowly unwinds again, 
reflecting a lack of desire on the government's part to sell-off state assets in a depressed market, and with potential 
for politically-toxic consequences.
Brendan Howlin, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, did not pencil in exact windfalls from specific asset 
sales for 2013 in last week's budget calculations, but government time-wasting on this issue may actually be about 
to pay off.
The troika has put pressure on it to press ahead with some asset sales but, as it continues to deliver on its austerity 
targets, the lenders of last resort are now a little more inclined to cut them some slack.
This is an important shift, because it now makes it more likely that the proceeds of any asset sales could be used to 
stimulate economic activity rather than simply being used to pay down debt, as would have been requested 12 
months ago.
State hopes for an asset windfall
The proceeds of the sale of the state's stake in Aer Lingus could, in theory, be used by the government for 
whatever it likes. But there are other, bigger windfalls coming.
**The National Lottery licence**
International bidders are already lining up to make offers for a 20-year licence to operate the National Lottery. US 
firm G-Tech, which already supplies the terminals to the National Lottery, and British lottery giant Camelot are 
believed to be interested.
Howlin has signalled that, if the contract is structured in a certain way, it could be worth EUR 400 million. He has 
already earmarked the proceeds of this sale for the National Children's Hospital, which has been dogged by delays 
and planning issues. It is understood that the troika has already approved this use of the funds.
**Coillte's tree-harvesting rights**
The government is going ahead with the clever notion of selling the harvesting rights to Coillte's trees. Self-evidently 
crazy ideas such as selling Coillte, which owns close to 9 per cent of the land in Ireland, were first mooted back in 
the mid-1990s.
With those abandoned, a straight sale of the Coillte business would not yield very much, based on a multiple of 
profits. But the sale or licencing of tree rights for a 20-year period could bring in tens of millions of euro.
The big challenge here will be establishing what happens to the existing Coillte business, including its assets and 
employees.
Nevertheless, this could bring in a reasonable windfall, although it's more likely to happen in 2014 than next year.
**4G mobile licences**
The telecommunications regulator has conducted a very successful bidding process for 4G mobile licences that will 
yield around EUR 855 million in the coming years. While it's not all paid upfront, it is essentially money in the bank, 
which the government can allocate for other constructive uses.
**Non-strategic ESB assets**
ESB seems to be the great untouchable when it comes to privatisation. Powerful trade unions and political 
sensitivities and ideologies rule when it comes to this national treasure. The company is potentially worth several 
billion euro, and that is without selling off the network.
However, the thoughts of such a move have the unions up in arms and the politicians running scared. Instead, the 
current government said that it would sell a strategic stake in the company as recently as last year. This idea has 
now been abandoned.
Last October, energy minister Pat Rabbitte told ESB that he wanted EUR 400 million from the company as a special 
dividend. The money is to come from the sale of some non-strategic generating assets. The move looked like a 
reaction to pressure from the troika, and it may well have been.
The tricky issue for ESB is deciding what to sell and when. The minister's announcement effectively makes it a 
forced seller. This is not good when it comes to getting the best price.
ESB recently raised EUR 500 million in a bond issue, which it said would be used to pay down and refinance debt. 
This showed how easily the company could put its hands on EUR 500 million when it needs to. But the minister 
appears to want the company to sell something.
State hopes for an asset windfall
ESB has considerable windfarm and conventional power-generating assets in Britain. On the face of it, those assets 
appear non-strategic. However, the company argues that, with the opening of electricity markets, there needs to be 
a greater integration of the British and Irish markets and, with the interconnector, they can largely become one.
ESB wants to protect its position in this wider regional market. It has a sizeable power generation project under 
construction near Manchester, as well as wind farms in Devon and Wales. Its big foreign asset is the 50 per cent 
share it has in a power plant near Bilbao in Spain. The other 50 per cent is owned by a Japanese power company.
Selling wind farms might not yield enough money. Selling the Manchester project before it's even built is 
complicated. Other projects have debts, so it would have to sell something big, such as the Bilbao plant, to come 
away with a net EUR 400 million.
**Bord Gáis's customer business**
The government is going ahead with the sale of the Bord Gáis customer business, in a deal that could be worth 
EUR 1 billion. Such a move safeguards the gas infrastructure in state hands, while selling a pretty vibrant and 
profitable business operation. Inevitably the move will have political complications around employees and where 
they end up, but it should deliver a windfall.
Excluding the EUR 400 million or so from the lottery licence that is due to go to the new Children's Hospital, there 
hasn't been a specific allocation of privatisation funds to other areas. The state earmarked around EUR 3 billion for 
sale of state assets.
The growing debate in Europe about austerity versus stimulus, and the best-in-class status of Ireland in delivering 
on austerity, will both soften the mood of the troika. This could give the government greater leeway in what it does 
with this money over the next two years.
It is unthinkable that it would be used to plug current expenditure deficits in areas such as health, and that will not 
be allowed to happen. The state could seek approval to use at least some of the proceeds in a spending package. 
But, so far, the government has had to be prodded and cajoled into advancing these asset sales. The approach has 
been to wait until we are forced into selling.
If things get really bad on the ground over the 12 months, we could see the proceeds rolled out into some kind of 
spending package for 2014.

EasyJet's November traffic rises as strike threat dents Aer Lingus
EasyJet's November traffic rises as strike threat dents Aer Lingus

EASYJET yesterday posted a jump in traffic for November alongside news that it will start flying to Newquay, while 
low-cost rival Aer Lingus said its traffic was hit by the threat of industrial action.
Passenger numbers for EasyJet last month were up 7.7 per cent on a year ago to 4.12m. In the 12 months to 
November, traffic jumped 7.3 per cent to top 59m.
The firm's load factor, a measure of how full its planes are, rose 1.3 percentage points to 89.6 per cent last month.
EasyJet announced a new route from Southend to Newquay yesterday, with the first flight taking off next summer.
The firm's UK commercial manager Hugh Aitken said its flights would be quicker than the existing road and rail 
routes linking London with the south west of England.
"London Southend Airport is our newest and fastest growing UK base with over 400,000 passengers travelling with 
EasyJet since its opening in March this year," he added. Meanwhile Aer Lingus said its overall passenger numbers 
rose 2.1 per cent to 766,000 in November, slower than its year-to-date growth trend of 3.6 per cent.
Short-haul traffic slipped 2.2 per cent to 593,000 as the airline endured the threat of industrial action from members 
of Siptu, Ireland's largest trade union.
But the firm's traffic stats were given a boost by its burgeoning regional services, which grew 28 per cent to 86,000 
last month.
Aer Lingus is awaiting the outcome of a European probe into Ryanair's takeover bid for the firm earlier this year. 
The European Commission has set a 6 February deadline for its decision.

The ISEQ is up 21 points this morning as markets are becoming more optimistic about a resolution of the Fiscal 
Cliff issue in the US amid signs that the European recession may be easing at last.
OAG has reported that flight operations within Europe have decreased by 7pc and offered seats by 3pc. Flights and 
seats offered to or from Europe both show a marginal decrease of 0.1pc. In this benign environment, the low-cost 
airlines continue to outperform.
EasyJet has reported traffic growth of 7.7pc with loads increasing by 1.3 percentage points to 89.6pc for the month 
of November. Ryanair meanwhile yesterday reported traffic growth of 5pc with loads flat at 80pc. From a lower 
base, Norwegian reported traffic growth of 21pc and unit revenue rises of 5pc - yields up 6pc, loads down 1 point to 
76pc. Air Berlin has reported capacity down 11.6pc, passenger numbers down 8.4pc and loads up 2.7 percentage 
points.
Aer Lingus reported a 1.5pc increase in passenger load factor: 8.4pc in long-haul with traffic up 12.4pc and a 
negative 3.1pc in short-haul with traffic down 6.8pc. The airline highlights that short-haul traffic with its" high 
dependency on Irish originating demand, was adversely impacted by threatened industrial action in the month". 
Meanwhile, IAG yesterday reported traffic up 3.6pc (up 1.7pc on a like-for-like basis) and loads up 1.9 points (2.3 
points on a like-for-like basis) with premium traffic growing 4.7pc and non-premium by 3.4pc. North American loads 
were up 4.6 points. On market conditions, the company indicated continued firmness in trends at British Airways 
and weakness in Spanish markets: traffic was up 7.6pc at BA and down 5.8pc at Iberia. DAVY VIEW: Generally, 
traffic numbers are positive, notably for certain intra-European airlines - the LCCs in particular -with the capacity 
environment helping. The North Atlantic market also remains very strong. According to Davy Stockbrokers.

THE FIRST big snowstorm of the winter forced Stansted Airport to close for around two hours this morning and 
caused disruption on train routes into London.
Stansted re-opened its runway shortly after 8am, having cleared two inches of snow, but the closure caused around 
40 cancellations and delays for frustrated passengers for the rest of the day.
Ryanair, Stansted's biggest airline, said some of its morning flights had been cancelled and that customers were 
eligible to transfer to a later journey free of charge.
Queues built up at the check-indesks during the morning, but most passengers had found their way onto new flights 
by yesterday afternoon, a Stansted spokesman said.
Luton Airport was also experiencing a backlog yesterday, after its runway was closed for an hour.
Commuters also suffered delays throughout the day on some Southeastern and South West Trains routes, 
including a reduced service to and from Waterloo.
Dozens of schools in Essex were closed.
Motorists also had trouble navigating the snow-covered roads, with the AA posting 29 traffic alerts across the UK 
yesterday.
The Met Office has forecast rain for Greater London today, and has issued an amber warning over possible icy 
conditions.
First winter snowstorm shuts airports and causes rail havoc
Temperatures were expected to plummet overnight to as low as -8 degrees celsius in parts of Scotland.

The coming decade will see a "flattening" of competition among European airlines, according to Iain Rawlinson, 
executive chairman of Monarch.
The privately held UK carrier hopes to benefit from rising costs at easyJet and Ryanair and a move to á la carte 
services , which allow passengers to tailor their travel requirements by flag-carriers.
Monarch said last week that a two-year turnround launched last year was on course to deliver a profitable company 
next year, on the back of higher passenger numbers, constrained capacity growth and an aggressive cost-cutting 
programme.
Mr Rawlinson predicted nearly two-thirds of the revenue growth he expected to see in the next 12 months would 
come from leisurefocused Monarch picking up routes dropped by competitors such as the tour operator Thomas 
Cook.
In the long term he believes the playing field with the big low-cost carriers will become more level.
"The fleet deals they got in the old days won't be repeated," he said, arguing that it would mean higher cost bases 
and a chance for Monarch to attract customers with competitive prices and better services.
"It is a pivotal moment. For the same price, customers will maybe get a better service."  Rose Jacobs

Iain Rawlinson predicted nearly two-thirds of the revenue growth he expected to see in the next 12 months would

But he added that, in the longer term, he believed the playing field with the big low-cost carriers would become

cost bases, and a chance for Monarch to pull away customers with competitive prices and better services.
"It really is a pivotal moment. For the same price, customers will maybe get a better service."
While aviation experts agreed Ryanair and easyJet - which are both considering big aircraft orders in the next year - 
would be paying more for new aircraft than they did in past deals, they questioned the extent to which that would 
change the competitive landscape.
Gert Zonneveld, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, argued that an airline's depreciation costs represented just a 
fraction of total costs per seat, and would only rise slowly over time in any case. "There may be some upward 
pressure but I don't think Ryanair is going to be quaking in its boots," he said.
Monarch aims to soar over rivals
But RBC Capital analysts wrote in a note on Friday that easyJet, for one, appeared set to push up its top-line 
through higher prices rather than volume growth, leaving it vulnerable both to "eventual passenger pushback on 
total travel cost price and targeted competitive responses".
Monarch, which also runs a tour operator and maintenance division, is itself looking to order 45 aircraft - to both 
replace older models and expand the commercial airline's 38-jet fleet - for delivery over the next eight years. Robert 
Palmer, finance director, said the group was aiming for a single-manufacturer fleet, be it Airbus, Boeing or 
Bombardier aircraft.
Douglas McNeil at Charles Stanley praised the progress the group had made over the past year. "They've taken a 
leaf out of the easyJet handbook," he said, referring to capacity discipline and an emphasis on web marketing.

            http://www.dailypolitical.com/logos/ryanair-holdings-plc-logo.jpgRyanair Holdings plc (NASDAQ: RYAAY) 
was upgraded by equities researchers at Goldman Sachs from a 'neutral' rating to a 'buy' rating in a report issued 
on Tuesday. 
 The analysts wrote, 'We expect Ryanair to benefit from continued pricing strength in 2H13/FY14 (we forecast 
revenue per pax growth of 5.4%/3.2%) owing to capacity discipline in the European short-haul market. This, 
together with limited capex commitments, should drive improving asset turn and returns on capital as well as 
significant cash generation, placing Ryanair at an increasing discount to its historical valuation. We factor into our 
valuation a return on capital impact from a new plane order, which we expect to be limited.'
 Ryanair Holdings plc traded up 2.14% on Tuesday, hitting $35.32. Ryanair Holdings plc has a 52-week low of 
$27.66 and a 52-week high of $37.12. The company has a market cap of $10.178 billion and a price-to-earnings 
ratio of 12.71.
 A number of other analysts have also recently weighed in on RYAAY. Analysts at Citigroup downgraded shares of 
Ryanair Holdings plc from a 'buy' rating to a 'neutral' rating in a research note to investors on Monday, November 
12th. Analysts at Imperial Capital raised their price target on shares of Ryanair Holdings plc from $36.00 to $40.00

British Airways is seeking compensation from Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, claiming it suffered losses because 
of a series of strikes held in Spain.
British Airways is suing for damages because it claims the strikes organised by Sepla had a negative impact on 
joint businesses that the UK airline has with Iberia, the Spanish carrier.
International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, is also involved in the legal action against 
Sepla, but it denied the move was intended to put pressure on the union to agree to a sweeping restructuring of 
Iberia .
Justo Peral, Sepla's main representative at Iberia, denied the union had damaged British Airways.
But he responded to the legal action by saying the union would not negotiate with management on the proposed 
Iberia restructuring, which was announced this month and involves cutting 4,500 jobs - 22 per cent of the workforce.
This highlights the increasingly febrile situation at Iberia. Unions representing cabin crew and ground staff are 
threatening six days of strikes , starting on December 14, in protest at the restructuring plan.
Sepla is barred from joining the industrial action because of a government-commissioned arbitration process that 
brought the earlier set of strikes to an end in April.
Those strikes, which began last December and ran over 18 days, were organised after Iberia announced plans for 
Iberia Express, a budget airline.
Iberia has been struggling against low-cost carriers led by Ryanair, and Iberia Express is supposed to provide a 
competitive alternative. Iberia Express pilots are paid less than those at Iberia and this prompted the industrial 
action.
BA sues Spanish pilots' union over strike losses TRAVEL & LEISURE
British Airways is seeking damages because it has a joint business with Iberia for passenger services between 
London and Madrid, and the UK carrier claims this venture was damaged by the strikes.
It also claims the strikes damaged another joint business involving British Airways, Iberia and American Airlines for 
passenger services between Europe and the US.
IAG said: "IAG is seeking a declaration that its EU rights were infringed and British Airways is seeking damages 
because the strikes affected its business, causing it to incur financial loss."
IAG and British Airways are expected to claim that the strikes were not justified or proportionate because Iberia 
pilots did not have their pay and benefits changed following the establishment of Iberia Express in March.
In March, Iberia announced it was suing Sepla for damages over the strikes at Iberia Express.

RYANAIR will today introduce two surcharges on its online flight bookings, blaming an Office of Fair Trading ruling 
for the hike in fees.
The low-cost airline, which has been on the receiving end of several OFT complaints over surprise booking fees, 
said it is adding the levies after the watchdog's crackdown on air tickets over the summer.
Ryanair said the two per cent credit card processing fee will be in addition to its £6 per flight fee for all bookings 
through its website, which will now be included in the headline price.
Both charges come into effect today, four months after a number of other firms altered their online booking systems 
to comply with the OFT's recommendations on transparent pricing. The OFT yesterday objected to Ryanair's 
reasoning, issuing a statement to stress that is has "not made any airline introduce new payment charges, increase 
their credit card charges, or scrap any discounts they wish to offer".
The Irish airline hit back, slamming the OFT's planned changes over the summer as "anti-consumer".
"As the OFT has removed our ability to help passengers avoid fees through exclusive partnerships perhaps they 
may wish to pay these fees on the consumers' behalf," said a spokesman.

The ISEQ shook of earlier lacklustre trading to close sharply up to regain the 3,300 level and in line with a surge in 
European markets.
The index rose 31.79 points to 3,300.73.
A leading European share index hit its highest closing level since July 2011 today, led by mining stocks, on 
increased optimism that U.S. politicians would reach a deal to avoid growth-sapping austerity measures.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index provisionally closed up 1.1 percent at 1,121.32 points, while the euro 
zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index gained 1.3 percent to 2,579.85 points. Equity markets were buoyed by 
comments from U.S. President Barack Obama that he hoped to reach a deal before Christmas to avoid the looming 
"fiscal cliff" of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that could hit the U.S. economy. Ryanair has announced that 
in order to comply with the UK Office of Fair Trading ruling on credit cards, it will introduce an avoidable 2pc credit 
card processing fee on all new credit card bookings made from November 30th to cover credit card payment costs. 
Ryanair's 2pc credit card fee can be avoided by using debit cards (including Ryanair Cash Passport cards) or 
German ELV transfer. "Ryanair continues to have the lowest fares by some distance in the industry. The sensitivity 
to net earnings is c.6pc, or c.E35m, for every 1pc yield movement, or 8pc, or E44m, for every 1pc total unit revenue 
movement into FY2014. We currently project net earnings of E550.2m, total revenue per passenger of E61.30 (2pc 
growth) and yields of E48.40 (2.3pc growth)," said Davy. Shares in the airline climbed 4c to E4.78. Dixons Retail 
has released (November 29th) its financial year results. Dixons Retail is Europe's largest specialist electrical retailer 
and services company, operating in 26 countries. It is the market leader in the UK and Ireland, Nordic countries, 
Greece and the Czech Republic. It was an encouraging start to the year with group like-for-like sales up 3pc in the

From Mr Joe Gill.
Sir, Your article "Flag carriers struggle to find route to profits" (November 20) unmasks a key faultline in commercial 
aviation. On one side is an array of suppliers including aircraft manufacturers, lessors, airports and global 
distribution systems. All of these have a long record of generating equity value by producing returns on capital that 
exceed its cost. Yet, these providers depend entirely for their existence on a group of airlines that in aggregate have 
destroyed shareholder value for decades.
It is only by applying the cost disciplines of a Tibetan monk, particularly in short-haul markets, that airlines can 
create real value for their own shareholders instead of for suppliers.
Joe Gill,
Corporate Development,

Body
SAS has long stood for what is wrong with much of Europe's airline industry. The Scandinavian flag carrier has 
been pummelled by low-cost competition as its higher ticket prices and dropping of free food and drinks - save for 
coffee and tea - has driven passengers into the aircraft of rivals Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.
At fault was not only a cripplingly high cost base that led to it turning in small profits for a mere two years in the past 
decade, but a relationship between workers and the company that was both complex and unhealthy.
However, SAS's decade-long struggle to restructure itself back to health highlights a much broader issue for much 
of European industry, such as its troubled carmakers: could it have benefited from a Chapter 11-style bankruptcy 
used in the US? It is no idle question. Rickard Gustafson, SAS's chief executive, pointedly said last week that all big 
US carriers had been through Chapter 11 protection, which allowed them to slash salaries and pensions while 
continuing in business. SAS itself has explored several times whether it should declare itself bankrupt. Under 
Swedish law, there is a possibility for a court-ordered restructuring that has some similarities to the American 
Chapter 11. But crucially Sweden has not signed up to an international convention that prevents creditors from 
seizing aircraft on foreign soil; SAS worried that lenders could therefore take ownership of any aeroplane landing in, 
say, London. Saab, the carmaker, also had difficulties in using the procedure when it tried and failed to avoid 
bankruptcy last year .
Swedish lawyers say that there is little appetite for a full Chapter 11 as there is a strong belief that companies that 
can no longer pay their debts are best declared insolvent, allowing their best assets to be sold off and the rest 
wound down.
But the power of Chapter 11 for turning around companies with big legacy costs can be seen best of all in the 
revival of General Motors and Chrysler in the US. The carmakers closed factories, dumped assets, cut debt and 
slashed labour costs after filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Both rebounded strongly afterwards with GM refloating on 
the stock exchange the following year and Chrysler now propping up its new majority owner, Italy's Fiat.
Struggling Europeans covet US -style bankruptcy
Some European countries have sought to implement regimes similar to Chapter 11. The UK has company voluntary 
agreements, much in demand from retailers such as JJB Sports, which has twice used them . France and Spain 
have changed their rules in an attempt to change the dismal statistic that about 90 per cent of insolvencies in both 
countries had ended in liquidation.
When SAS, which is still half-owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark - even if the first two 
would desperately like to sell out - looked at outsourcing its ground handling business five years ago, it quickly 
halted the plans almost immediately. The reason? The company learnt that unions would strike over the critical 
Christmas and New Year period if the deal went ahead.
Similarly, the agreements with its main workers were mind-bogglingly complex: those for pilots ran to 200-300 
pages while those for the cabin crew were more than 100 pages. If the airline wanted to change a route - to fly, say, 
from Stockholm to Berlin rather than Munich - pilots had to be consulted. This went beyond consensual 
Scandinavian labour relations; the employees were essentially running the company alongside management.
All this means that this week's wage deal at SAS is an important breakthrough. A bruising week-long negotiation - 
that dragged on for almost a day after a self-imposed deadline - ended with the eight unions in three countries that 
represent pilots and cabin crew agreeing to new working conditions and pay cuts of up to 15 per cent. The worker 
agreements have shrunk to a more manageable 40 pages.
There is still reason to be sceptical: SAS remains almost entirely dependent on its short-haul operations, which are 
most exposed to ferocious competition and growing passenger indifference to anything other than price. The goal 
expressed by the managers may be to rival Ryanair and Norwegian on costs, but some analysts believe SAS's 
culture as a legacy carrier hinders it from ever being as nimble. Chapter 11 is not without its flaws - some complain 
that companies get off relatively easy - but it is of undoubted help to companies dealing with deep-rooted cost 
problems.
Given the state of companies such as SAS and PSA Peugeot Citroën, the French carmaker trying to restructure 
under heavy political pressure, it is little wonder that US bankruptcy law is the envy of many European bosses.

A raft of upgrades from Barclays gave Europe's airline sector a boost, with Deutsche Lufthansa and Air France-

Barclays raised its target on Deutsche Lufthansa from EUR10.25 to EUR11.50 with an "equal weight" outlook.
Investors bought into the German flag carrier, sending its shares up 4.9 per cent to EUR12.51 against a 0.8 per 
cent gain on the German Xetra Dax index to 7,244.99.
Barclays also lifted its target on Air France-KLM from EUR4 to EUR6.30 with an "equal weight" outlook.
The airline's shares climbed 2.6 per cent to EUR6.78, as the French CAC40 index saw a 0.6 per cent rise to 
3,498.22.
Budget carrier Ryanair , which recently endured heavy selling, received a fillip as Barclays increased its price target 
from EUR4.40 to EUR4.95. Ryanair shares were up 2.4 per cent to EUR4.69.
"The continued revenue strength in airlines has been impressive given the economic backdrop but the outcome has 
been unusual in our view," the bank's analysts wrote.
International Airlines Group was the only airline to maintain an "overweight" outlook.
Its shares gained 1.9 per cent to 168.10p.

Objections increase to Ryanair merger push

Body
Brussels' objections toRyanair's third takeover bid for Aer Lingus are even more extensive than when it first blocked 
the tie-up in 2007, according to the EU competition authority's formal charge sheet.
The European Commission's " statement of objections ", issued last week, argues that the merged Irish carrier 
would hold a more dominant position than in 2007, according to people familiar with its contents. It would have an 
effective stranglehold over more than 40 routes.
These reservations indicate that Ryanair has a steeper hill to climb in Brussels than with its first bid for Aer Lingus. 
That was prohibited five years ago on the grounds that the combined group would have a monopoly on 22 routes 
and dominate on 13 more.
The commission served its charges after rejecting what Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, described as a 
"revolutionary" remedies package to secure regulatory approval.
Ryanair said it had found airlines willing to provide services on routes that would otherwise be dominated by the 
merged carrier. But Brussels made clear the proposals failed to address all the routes with competition problems.
Indeed, the commission found the measures so unsatisfactory it decided against asking rival airlines to comment on 
the details - the usual step in assessing concessions. Ryanair is confident the commission will "market test" its 
proposals shortly.
Significantly, the commission also dismissed Ryanair's claim that the merger would bring efficiency gains that would 
be passed on to consumers through lower prices and better services.
The barriers to entry facing carriers wanting to challenge Ryanair on its home territory were also identified as a 
factor hindering competition, should the merger go ahead.
Objections increase to Ryanair merger push
Ryanair declined to comment, beyond saying: "We are confident that the remedies are radical and hopefully get us 
over the line [with the commission] this time." The commission declined to comment.
Mr O'Leary said this week that if the commission rejected the merger, the carrier could consider the case for 
challenging Brussels' decision in the courts.
British Airways and Flybe are believed to be considering the case for running services on some routes where a deal 
between Ryanair and Aer Lingus would leave the merged company in a strong position. Some other airlines, 
including EasyJet, have rebuffed Ryanair's request that they compete with the merged company.
Brussels' conclusion that a tie-up between Ryanair and Aer Lingus would be more damaging for competition now 
than in 2007 chimes with the Irish flag carrier's own view. Aer Lingus said in July that the number of routes where it 
and Ryanair are the only operators had risen from 22 in 2007 to 44 in 2012 .

Budget airline Ryanair is to cut the number of routes it operates from Budapest by a third from next year, it said 
today, in reaction to an increase in airport charges.
The move comes just months after Ryanair set up a base at Budapest following the collapse of Hungary's national 
airline Malev.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary, who has said financial problems among flag carriers in Europe offers a major 
growth opportunity, said the cuts would be made after airport operator, Hochtief raised its user charges.
"The strange logic of Budapest (airport) and Hochtief seems to be, 'we have less traffic so we charge the existing 
traffic more'. That recipe is doomed to failure," O'Leary told reporters at a news conference in the Hungarian capital. 
Ryanair moved into Budapest in February with five aircraft based there now plans to cut that to three and close 10 
of the 30 routes operated from Budapest from Jan. 10. The airline said this would result in a 40 percent fall in 
Ryanair's passenger traffic at the airport to 1.2 million per year and would lead to the loss of 800 local jobs. Ryanair 
has previously cut routes from other airports where it has wanted lower airport charges but the company is not 
considering pulling out of Hungary altogether, O'Leary said. Ryanair said the number of its flights from Budapest 
would fall by 110 to less than 170 per week as it would also be cutting the frequency of its flights on nine of the 20 
remaining routes.

Body
EasyJet founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou failed in an attempt to sling chairman Michael Rake off the board in 
August. But the entrepreneur can at least claim to have lobbied for two moves announced by the low-cost European 
airline.
The first is to adopt a more accurate measure of return on capital employed, which accordingly drops from 14.5 per 
cent to 11.3 per cent. The second is to increase recurring dividends (rather than special payouts) from one-fifth to 
one-third of post-tax profits.
The changes are interlinked: the "rocky", as ROCE is called in finance director street slang, is still well ahead of 
easyJet's 7.5 per cent cost of capital. So giving a bigger slice to shareholders, including the combative Sir Stelios 
and his family, should be affordable.
The move supported by a £69m jump in full-year pre-tax profits to £317m, dispels any lingering delusion that chief 
executive Carolyn McCall, former boss of struggling Guardian Media Group, lacks the acumen to run an airline. She 
has also coped well with the other main requirement of her job: handling Sir Stelios.
EasyJet should continue to gain from the pain of European flag carriers overburdened with legacy costs, even if 
mean reversion requires disruption costs from strikes and bad weather to rise. The shares, trading at a narrowing 
discount to Ryanair, are a good investment.

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd., an Ireland-based airline company, has announced that it will extend its reserved seat 
service from four to six rows by adding rows 5 and 15 on all aircraft.
Body
This will allow more passengers to reserve their preferred seats on six reserved rows (1, 2, 5, 15, 16 & 17). 
Ryanair's optional reserved seat service, which costs E10/GBP10 each way (E15/GBP15 on longer routes) and 
includes priority boarding, allows passengers to reserve seats in the front of the aircraft or in over-wing rows (for 
greater legroom). Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair is pleased to extend our popular reserved seat 
service to an additional two rows, which are bookable now, for travel on all routes. Since January, passengers have 
been able to reserve their preferred seats in the front two rows to ensure a prompt exit on arrival, or in over-wing 
exits, for extra legroom, from just E10/GBP10 per flight, which includes priority boarding. "Our reserved seating 
service will now include rows 5 and 15, meaning greater choice for all Ryanair passengers."

Moody's but with hopes rising that the US can sort out its fiscal crisis.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 17.64 points to 3,237.41.
European shares ticked lower today, with French and Italian stocks underperforming after Moody's cut France's 
credit rating and said Italy's banking outlook remained negative, although losses were seen limited. Italy's FTSE 
MIB fell 0.6 percent to lead weaker regional stock indexes, pressured by financials, after Moody's Moody's said the 
operating conditions for Italian banks were difficult and would remain challenging.
Shares in Ryanair rose 8c to E4.64. easyJet has this morning reported results for FY12 come in line with our 
estimates and at the top end of the guided PBT range (£310-320m) as at the October pre-close announcement. 
FY12 PBT at £317m was just 1pc behind our estimate of £318.7m and 2pc ahead of consensus of £310m. The 
outlook is confident and management has raised the dividend payout ratio from one fifth to one third. CRH's stocks 
fell 10c to E13.83. Yesterday's releases on the US housing market highlight the increasing strength of this segment 
of the construction sector. Existing home sales were up 2.1pc in October to an annualised pace of 4.79m 
(consensus 4.74m), while the home builder confidence index reached a six-year high of 46. This strength is also 
feeding into house prices with the median price of an existing home increasing by 11pc in October, representing the 
biggest yoy increase since Nov-05.

SAS staves off bankruptcy after marathon meetings
SAS staves off bankruptcy after marathon meetings

Body
SAS has staved off the immediate threat of bankruptcy after all eight unions representing flight personnel at the 
Scandinavian airline signed up to wage cuts of up to 15 per cent.
In a marathon negotiating session that lasted from Sunday morning until yesterday afternoon, SAS managed to 
convince one union after another to sign up to the deal.
Shares in the airline - co-owned by Sweden, Norway and Denmark - rose 23 per cent to Skr6.9, their highest level 
in three weeks.
SAS should now receive a new SKr3.5bn ($519m) credit facility from its banks and shareholder governments that 
was conditional on all pilots and cabin crew signing up to a new working contract involving pay cuts and more 
flexible working patterns.
Final confirmation of the credit is dependent on approval from members of the Danish pilots' union as well as 
parliamentary approval in some countries.
The perennially lossmaking airline has struggled to make a profit throughout the past decade because of its high 
costs and fierce competition from rivals such as Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair.
SAS has also paid the price for having a business model focused on extremely price-sensitive short-haul flights, 
unlike the big European flag carriers which are more centred on long-haul routes.
"Now we have made a base to work on with our plan.
"This is a first step. There remains a lot of work to do but it is a first, important step," said Rickard Gustafson, SAS's 
chief executive, in Copenhagen after the last union representing Danish cabin crew signed up nearly a day after the 
airline's initial self-imposed deadline.
SAS staves off bankruptcy after marathon meetings
Some analysts remain sceptical that SAS's plan - which involves SKr3bn of annual cost savings as well as selling 
SKr3bn in assets - will be sufficient in the long term.
"It is more entertainment than business," said one Danish analyst, saying that international investors lost interest in 
SAS after two rights issues in 2009 and 2010. "A default is clearly in nobody's interest. But it is hard to see it 
suddenly being able to compete with Ryanair."
SAS still has much to do to reach its SKr3bn target for cost savings. It intends to cut 40 per cent of its workers, 
reducing its staff to 9,000, and centralise its administrative functions in Stockholm.
It also is seeking to shift workers from defined benefit to defined contribution pensions to ease the pain from an 
accounting change that could have wiped out all its shareholder equity.
Worries have surfaced about the damage the week-long negotiations have done to its image and ticket sales in 
Scandinavia.
The airline is looking for bidders for its ground handling and Widerøe, its Norwegian regional carrier.
Mr Gustafson and board members have said they want to become as competitive as Ryanair in costs.

Body
The UK government should allow the construction of more runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports but 
not back "insane" plans for a new hub in the Thames estuary, Ryanair told a parliamentary inquiry yesterday.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, told the Commons transport select 
committee that Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports should each have an additional runway over the next 10 to 
15 years.
He attacked proposals for an airport in the Thames estuary as "insane, stupid, hare-brained".
Boris Johnson, London's mayor, has backed the idea of an estuary hub, which has been proposed by Lord Foster , 
the architect, among others, because Heathrow is operating at near-full capacity.
Competition regulators have forced Heathrow Airport Holdings to sell Gatwick and Stansted airports, and Mr 
O'Leary said extra capacity at all three airports would be good for the aviation industry and consumers.
He questioned the need for the planned independent commission into airport capacity , to be chaired by Sir Howard 
Davies, former head of the CBI employers' organisation.
Simon Buck, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association, said it was important the commission's 
recommendations secured the backing of the main political parties.

Santa's elves, facing the logistics challenge of getting goods out of Lapland, may be relieved. SAS, the Sweden-
based airline whose service includes the Finnish province, stepped back from a financial precipice yesterday when 
its unions agreed cost-cutting deals . These are vital if a new $500m credit facility is to flow. Shares in the carrier - 
half-owned by Scandinavian governments and where pre-tax losses have topped SKr12bn ($1.8bn) over the past 
decade - rose 25 per cent to SKr7.
Whether investors elsewhere in Europe's airline industry feel thankful is another matter. Despite four years of 
economic turmoil, consolidation in the sector has been painfully slow. That can be attributed partly to European 
merger policy, which focuses on individual route overlap. This doomed a merger between Greek carriers Olympic 
and Aegean and bodes ill for Ryanair's latest effort to take over Aer Lingus. True, severe financial problems have 
grounded a few players - such as Malev and Spanair. But the big flag-carriers - including Lufthansa and Air France-
KLM - have only become serious about politically-sensitive cost-cutting in the past 12 months. Lufthansa, for 
example, expects to increase capacity by only 0.5 per cent in its passenger airline business this year, with winter 
timetable cuts. In 2011, there was a 10 per cent increase, group-wide, in available seat kilometres. With leading 
low-cost carrier Ryanair also remaining disciplined - it will park 80 aircraft this winter - short-haul yields (ticket 
prices) have generally benefited.
But the big flag-carriers have more resilient long-haul business to help them through tough restructurings. SAS less 
so. Even after yesterday's gains, its enterprise value is below SKr10bn ($1.5bn), or less than one-quarter of 
estimated 2012 revenues. That suggests scepticism about SAS's long-term flight path. The elves may not be out of 
the woods just yet.

THE BRITISH public would like to see the government invest in or facilitate more house building to boost the 
flagging economy, according to a poll out yesterday.
However, a survey suggests that there is less support for building new airports and runways or for beefing up the 
country's rail infrastructure.
Four in ten people believe that government support for building more homes is the best way for the state to boost 
the economy through infrastructure projects, according to a poll of 1,442 people by Ipsos Mori.
Two in ten see improvements to roads as the best option, while 14 per cent think work on existing rail infrastructure 
would be the most effective way to kickstart growth in this manner.
In contrast, five per cent chose expanding air capacity as their preferred project, while four per cent want a new 
high speed rail line the most.
The High Speed 2 Action Alliance, which lobbies against HS2 and commissioned the research, said the poll 
showed public opinion lags behind the coalition's ambitious plans.
The lack of enthusiasm for aviation expansion has not deterred air chiefs from banging the drum for more capacity, 
however.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary told the transport select committee yesterday that the UK needs "at least three [new 
runways]: one at Heathrow, one at Gatwick, one at Stansted, as fast as possible". However, he mocked the idea of 
Brits want more housing but not high speed rail
a new hub in the Thames Estuary as "insane, stupid, harebrained", stopping himself of going much further as "in 
parliamentary language it would be unprintable".

RYANAIR may mount a legal challenge if its bid to buy Irish rival Aer Lingus is blocked by the European Union but it 
will not pursue further acquisitions if the merger ultimately fails, its chief executive has told Rueters news agency.
Michael O'Leary is trying for the third time to buy Ireland's once dominant airline, but the European Union says the 
deal may curb competition.
O'Leary said that if the effort fails, the airline will focus on growing organically and take advantage of the enormous 
opportunities created by the rapid deterioration in the finances of European legacy airlines like Iberia and SAS.
"If it is not approved I can always appeal to the European courts... it is one of the options that would be available to 
us," O'Leary said.
"If they don't allow this, we'll just have to give up and grow organically," he said. The European Commission, which 
is due to make a decision on whether to approve the merger early next year, this week sent Ryanair a list of 
objections to the tieup.
The statement was seen by some analysts as a set-back for Ryanair's bid but O'Leary said the EU move was a 
procedural step which did not necessarily mean additional remedies were required.
Ryanair has already submitted a package of remedies to the commission that includes a commitment from at least 
two "major EU airlines" to set up bases in Dublin as part of a series of measures to allay concerns the merger would 
curb competition.
Ryanair to grow organically if bid is blocked
"There is nothing in the objections that can't, and in our humble opinion won't, be addressed by our remedies 
package," he said, adding that he would consider additional steps if needed.
The fact that Aer Lingus' share price is trading significantly below the bid price of 1.30 indicates that the markets is 
cautious on the deal, O''Leary said.

Daily flights from London to Scotland
Body
Virgin Atlantic is today expected to unveil ambitious plans to break into the short-haul domestic market from 
Heathrow after securing extra slots to start flights to Scotland.
The airline, controlled by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group, will announce it has won the bidding for 12 highly-
prized pairs of slots at Heathrow, which International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, was forced to 
divest as part of its takeover of BMI .
"We have fought hard for the right to fly short haul and take a strong challenge to British Airways within these 
shores," said Steve Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive.
The carrier, which has focused on long-haul destinations, will outline plans to start regular daily services to 
Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The new flights will start at the end of March - the same time as the -carrier's London to 
Manchester service, which it announced earlier this year .
Some analysts have expressed doubts about the decision to move into the highly competitive market.
Large network operators such as BA have struggled to make short-haul operations profitable in the face of fierce 
competition from low-cost carriers, such as easyJet and Ryanair.
But Virgin's management rejects those suggestions, pointing out BMI used to provide valuable feeder traffic to 
Virgin Atlantic's long-haul flights at Heathrow. It estimates its short-haul network could generate 1.5m feeder 
passengers per year.
"These new routes will provide a strong flow of feed onto our long-haul flights across the Atlantic and beyond. With 
up to a million passengers connecting through Europe each year, the addition of short- haul flying will have a 
material impact on our load factors and yield across much of the network," Virgin Atlantic said.
Virgin to launch UK short haul
Sir Richard has dabbled in short haul from the UK in the past but had not got beyond a service to Athens, which 
closed in 2001.
He also launched a Brussels-based short-haul airline, Virgin Express, in the 1990s, which merged with the 
remnants of Sabena, the now-defunct Belgian flag carrier, and which now operates as Brussels Airlines, with 
Germany's Lufthansa the biggest shareholder.
Regulators imposed conditions on the auction which mean the 12 pairs of daily slots at Heathrow can only be used 
to fly to six former BMI destinations: Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Nice, Moscow, Cairo and Riyadh.
Virgin failed to secure the rights to fly to Moscow last month and would need approval to serve Cairo and Riyadh. It 
could start flying to Nice but has no plans to do so. Virgin is considering appealing against the Moscow decision, 
which easyJet won.

Ryanair says it is pushing ahead with its bid for Aer Lingus, despite indications that it will never get it past the EU 
Commission. Ryanair has spent a lot of time and energy coming up with what are known in the jargon as 
"remedies" -- proposed fixes to the competition problems which its takeover of Aer Lingus would create. However, 
the commission last week delivered a statement of objections to Ryanair, basically saying that the remedies on offer 
were simply, in its view, not enough. Ryanair now has until December 21 to come up with a revised plan.
Ryanair's public stance is that this is all part of the normal comings and goings in such takeovers. Perhaps the 
commission is, indeed, just trying to squeeze every possible concession out of Ryanair. However, the indications 
are that it has more fundamental objections and that the takeover bid will not -- well, you can choose your aviation 
metaphor: fly, take-off, get airborne or whatever.
Michael O'Leary has the choice of fighting on, or letting the bid gradually die. History would suggest he won't give 
up yet. Even if the commission rejects the bid, he could consider appealing it to the European court, prolonging the 
whole affair for a number of years. This would presumably be based on the argument that the airline sector is 
consolidating rapidly in Europe and that the rules need to change to keep pace.
For the moment, the likely rejection by the commission is a setback for O'Leary, but you have to remember that this 
is all a much bigger deal for Aer Lingus than it is for Ryanair, whose most recently-published balance sheet showed 
it valued its Aer Lingus shares at EUR 165 million at the end of September, a small element of its total assets of 
EUR 5 billion. But, for sure, Aer Lingus is more than a side show. O'Leary feels that buying it would open up new 
growth opportunities -- but he has plenty of other places to look. Ryanair is now a mammoth business, carrying 
some 80 million passengers a year and operating 1,500 flights daily -- and it believes that there are plenty of growth 
options left for its low-cost model across Europe.
While the government may breath a sigh of relief if the Ryanair bid is finally blocked, big ownership and strategic 
questions still face Aer Lingus. Its management has made progress in cutting costs, and a EUR 90 million operating 
profit was achieved in the busy third quarter. However the government has committed to selling its 25.1 per cent 
Boardroom: Ryanair and Aer Lingus saga has a long way to fly
stake -- Gulf airline Etihad is interested -- and Ryanair remains the single biggest shareholder, with 29.8 per cent. 
Ethiad looks unlikely to buy both the government and Ryanair stakes; as a non-EU airline, it can hold only 49 per 
cent of an EU carrier -- and in any case, going above a holding of 29.9 per cent would oblige it to make an offer to 
all the other shareholders, unless it got special clearance not to do so.
Meanwhile, Aer Lingus may be in a more stable position financially, but it faces new competition on the Dublin-
London route from the merged BA/BMI and more transatlantic competition, too. With a bid ruled out, O'Leary could 
also decide to buy a few more Boeings and put some of them on new routes in competition with Aer Lingus. This 
risk, and the challenge of competing with Ryanair, is in itself a blockage to anyone else planning to buy the 
government's Aer Lingus stake or, ironically, Ryanair's stake.
In short, this is looking messy. Aer Lingus can successfully plough on, no doubt, but with one big shareholder 
planning to sell and the other likely to be thwarted in a takeover play, it remains torn between two difficult 
shareholders.
...........................
**It helps being a 'special case'**
If ever there was a week that highlighted the divergent views of Ireland at home and abroad, it was the one that has 
just ended. Investors rushed to lend the ESB and Bank of Ireland cash -- albeit lured by a decent return compared 
to what big European corporates would offer. The NTMA raised short-term borrowings at a cheaper rate and there 
was good interest in buying a chunk of our telecoms spectrum.
All well? The latest government economic forecasts suggested not, with growth expected to remain very sluggish 
and no net increase in job numbers expected next year. Like previous work from the EU Commission and the IMF, 
these figures showed just how delicate our debt position is -- our debt-to-GDP ratio is due to peak at just over 120 
per cent in 2013 and then start to edge downwards, but if growth does not recover, it will keep rising. Not far off one 
euro in every five collected in tax revenues will soon be going to pay off interest on this national debt.
International investors are not stupid -- not all of them anyway -- and they understand the risks. So why is Ireland so 
much in fashion? The only way to rationalise this is that investors believe that the EU/IMF and ECB will continue to 
help us, if needed, to avoid a debt write-down and that, while our growth performance is weak, it is not as bad as 
the collapse across much of the rest of the periphery.
For this reason, investors feel that the risk of buying Irish debt is worth it, in return for the higher returns available. 
With protests elsewhere on the periphery, their mood may also be influenced by a feeling that Ireland will stay the 
course. If you believe that there is an underlying strength in the economy here and that Europe will do enough to 
help Ireland emerge back into the markets, then lending us money probably appears a reasonable bet. Fitch's 
decision to change the outlook on our -- low -- debt rating from negative to stable was also a plus. For the moment, 
despite no signs of a growth revival, the momentum on the markets remains with us.
Further big tests lie ahead, of course. But for the moment, investors seem to see Ireland, to use the famous phrase, 
as a "special case".

"It means short-haul carriers are being taxed for some notional environmental reason whereas the European flag

RYANAIR remains confident of securing European Union approval of its bid to take over Irish rival Aer Lingus, 
despite receiving a statement of objections from its competition watchdog, the budget airline said yesterday.
Ryanair said the European Commission submitted its objections on Tuesday, but it has not made them public.
The airline still has the opportunity to make more concessions before a final commission decision that is due early 
next year.
"Ryanair... remains confident that its offer for Aer Lingus will receive competition clearance following any fair 
assessment by the commission," the airline said in a statement.
The issuing of a statement of objections is "a standard procedural step," Ryanair said.
It said it expected the Commission to market test its package of competition remedies.
Ryanair, which already owns 30 per cent of Aer Lingus, had an initial bid turned down by the European Commission 
on competition grounds in 2007 and dropped a second offer in 2009.
Analysts and investors view its latest (EURO)700m bid as a long shot - reflected in Aer Lingus's shares trading well 
below the bid price.

routes on which the two airlines currently have no competitors. Ryanair said it had secured agreement with third-
party airlines to create "a number of new airline bases in Dublin" and new competitors on over 40 routes out of 
Ireland. Additional solutions will guarantee increased price competition on routes out of Ireland, the airline said. The 
ISEQ fell 58.51 points to 3,233.32.

(RTTNews) - The UK market is trading lower on Wednesday, as global economic worries continued to weigh on 
investor sentiment, amid anti-austerity protests in the continent.
Greek Finance Minister Giannis Stournaras and Labor Minister Giannis Vroutsis told the European Parliament's 
Economic Affairs and Employment Committees on Tuesday that it is up to the EU to come forward with the next aid 
tranche.
There were many distortions in the Greek finance and labor markets that had to be tackled, but Greece has taken 
all the necessary measures, they noted.
Debt-ridden Greece successfully raised 4.06 billion euros on Tuesday by selling short term bills, easing concerns 
about how it would repay its debt maturing on Friday.
Eurozone industrial output dipped by a seasonally adjusted 2.5 percent in September from a month ago, Eurostat 
said. Economists had forecast a 2 percent fall after rising 0.9 percent in August.
Number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance in the U.K. rose by 10,100 in October from September to 1.58 
million, the Office for National Statistics said. The jobless claim figure was forecast to remain flat in October. The 
claimant count rate remained unchanged at 4.8 percent in October.
The Bank of England said in its quarterly inflation report that GDP growth is likely to fall back sharply in the fourth 
quarter. Inflation in near term is expected to be higher than estimated in August.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is falling 0.40 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is losing 0.69 percent.
The FTSE 100 index is currently losing 0.5 percent.
Inter-dealer broker ICAP reported a sharp decline in profit for the first half, as margins dropped due to reduction in 
revenue from voice broking as well as a decline in electronic volumes. The stock is declining 5.3 percent.
Ryanair Holdings is declining 6.4 percent. Citigroup cut the stock to "Neutral" from "Buy.''
Evraz is declining 3.4 percent and Eurasian Natural Resources is falling 2.7 percent. Glencore and Xstrata are 
notably lower.
UK Market Declines Moderately
S&P Equity raised Vodafone to "Buy" from "Hold.'' the stock is down 1 percent.
Sainsbury is losing 2.1 percent after reporting first-half results. Kingfisher and Burberry are down around 1.5 
percent each.
AMEC is climbing 3 percent. Weir Group is gaining 1.7 percent and Centrica is rising 1.5 percent.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX and the French CAC 40 are losing 0.2 percent each. Switzerland's SMI is 
down 0.3 percent.
Across Asia/Pacific, markets ended mostly in positive territory. Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.2 percent, 
Australia's All Ordinaries advanced 0.2 percent and China's Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.4 percent. Japan's 
Nikkei 225 ended nearly unchanged with a positive bias.
In the U.S., futures point to a higher open on Wall Street. In the previous session, the major averages ended the 
day firmly in negative territory, at their worst closing levels in over three months. The Dow fell 0.5 percent, the 
Nasdaq slid 0.7 percent and the S&P 500 dipped 0.4 percent.
In the commodity space, crude for December delivery is adding $0.37 to $85.75 per barrel while December gold is 
sliding $0.6 to $1724.2 a troy ounce.

Management tells staff a deal must be made by Sunday, say Richard Milne  and Andrew Parker
Body
In the European airline industry, where most flag carriers are walking wounded, SAS stands out as the one in 
intensive care.
The Scandinavian airline has warned staff they have until Sunday to accept deep cuts to pay and pensions or else it 
could go bust.
"This is not just me playing hardball: this is the brutal reality we are facing. But we have got a chance," Rickard 
Gustafson, chief executive, tells the Financial Times.
The rot set in a long time ago at SAS, which has lost money for almost every year of the past decade, apart from 
two years of small profits. The capital from two rights issues in 2009 and 2010 has been spent and the main 
shareholders have said there will be no more.
"We have got nothing left to consume. We have hit the end of the road. There is no alternative. It is this, or . . . ," 
says one director.
SAS's four leading shareholders - the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark that together own half of the 
airline, and the Wallenberg family - have agreed to provide a SKr3.5bn ($516m) credit facility, but only if a new 
labour agreement is reached by the weekend.
Mr Gustafson is under no illusions as to how difficult a task he is facing. He has to negotiate with eight unions in 
three countries just to get the pilots and cabin crew on board.
An SAS worker at Oslo's Gardermoen airport sums up the feeling among colleagues when she says: "We feel like 
we have given a lot to this airline. We've had pay freezes, cuts, everything.
SAS reaches the end of the runway on pay TRAVEL & LEISURE
"But I think people see this time it is really serious. I can't say what will happen. But we want to survive if we can."
SAS found itself in this predicament due to the deep-rooted problems for legacy carriers of high costs compared 
with newer rivals such as Ryanair, easyJet and a Scandinavian upstart that recently celebrated its 10th birthday, 
Norwegian Air Shuttle.
Mr Gustafson sums up SAS's vulnerability to the fast-expanding Norwegian by saying: "We can't have one 
competitor that we compete with on 60 per cent of our routes if we are not competitive." On one of the industry's 
main measures of cost levels - unit costs per available seat flown - SAS has substantially higher expenses than 
Norwegian: SKr0.86 ($0.13) against its low-cost rival's NKr0.45 ($0.08).
That translates into higher ticket prices. On a recent comparison of a return flight from Oslo to Stockholm next 
week, Norwegian had a cheapest price of NKr935, while SAS was close to NKr1,500.
SAS's predicament has been exacerbated by its heavy focus on short-haul operations. Nomura analysts highlight 
how SAS has a different business model from Europe's big flag carriers - Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and 
International Airlines Group - because they secure most of their revenue from long-haul operations, which usually 
generate more profits than short-haul flights due to the focus on business and first-class travellers.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, says SAS's focus on short-haul flights for business travellers moving 
between Scandinavia and Europe left it vulnerable to the aggressive expansion of low-cost carriers.
"With low-cost carriers' growth in market share, customers' expectations of the appropriate fare for short-haul air 
transport fell sharply all over Europe but particularly sharply in high-fare Scandinavia," he adds.
Mr Lobbenberg expresses doubts that SAS can secure a strategic investor, saying the most plausible candidate - 
Lufthansa - is pursuing a cautious dealmaking strategy.
The reason for the deadline of Sunday is clear: any longer and few people would want to buy an SAS ticket.
At Gardermoen airport yesterday, a gallows humour was evident.
"I've seen a plane take off today, so I'm hopeful for now. But I'm less sure about coming back," said one 
businessman bound for Copenhagen.
Mr Gustafson is trying to look beyond Sunday but admits the situation is perilous. "I honestly believe there is room 
in Scandinavia for a [full-service] carrier.
"The market is big enough for both of us. But we can't continue if we are not cost-efficient . . .
"Either we face that music and adapt to the new business environment or we don't. We have come to the end 
point."

European shares fell today, led by Ryanair in Dublin, as unrest in Europe over austerity measures raised fresh 
concerns over the economic outlook and overshadowed some upbeat company results.
The FTSEurofirst 300 provisionally closed down 8.8 points, or 0.8 percent, at 1,090.34, paring gains on Tuesday 
which came after speculation Spain might be closer to asking for a bailout.
Spain's reluctance to ask for aid centres around the punishing austerity measures the embattled country would be 
forced to adopt to qualify for payments.
Olli Rehn, the EU's top economic official, said measures announced for 2014 by Spain on deficit reductions fall 
short of what is required, although it has taken effective action to address its budget deficits in 2012 and 2013. 
"There are still some big macro headwinds out there," said David Hambidge, who leads the multi-asset team at 
Premier Asset Management, which has around 3 billion pounds of assets under management.

THE EUROPEAN Union has suspended its controversial carbon emissions tax for non-EU flights, after fierce 
protests from authorities around the world.
Airlines operating routes within the EU will still have to pay, but the bloc has issued a year-long exemption for flights 
linking EU airports to the rest of the world.
The Emissions Trading Scheme was introduced on 1 January to intense opposition. Beijing instructed its airlines to 
refuse to pay the tax on carbon emissions, while India and the United States have also hit back, calling instead for 
talks about a global levy.
The European commissioner for climate action Connie Hedegaard said yesterday the bloc was "stopping the clock" 
on the charge in light of "very good news" last week, when the International Civil Aviation Organisation agreed to 
progress with talks.
The EU has always said it will alter its rules if the ICAO can agree on a similar green tax. Hedegaard said 
yesterday's freeze will help "create a positive atmosphere" around the global negotiations leading up to an ICAO 
meeting next autumn.
But some European airlines, such as Ryanair, used the moratorium as a chance to lobby the EU to instead exclude 
all air travel from the "anticompetitive" green tax.

SAS warned workers yesterday that they had six days to agree to swingeing cuts in pay and pensions or else the 
perennially lossmaking Scandinavian airline could lose its fight for survival.
SAS wants to cut 40 per cent of its workforce either through redundancies or by selling businesses and is asking its 
remaining staff to take a pay cut of up to 15 per cent and move to defined contribution pensions.
Rickard Gustafson, chief executive, said the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark - which own half of the 
airline - and several lenders had given their backing to a new SKr3.5bn ($519m) credit facility but only if workers 
agreed to the new terms. SAS has scheduled a board meeting for Sunday to decide if it should press ahead or end 
its existence.
Mr Gustafson described it as SAS's "final call if there is to be a SAS in the future" and added that lenders had said: 
"We give you this chance to turn the company around. Otherwise we will not support you."
A director said: "If the agreement is not delivered then SAS is no more."
SAS is perhaps the most threatened of all flag carriers in western Europe after being hit by fierce competition from 
Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair, combined with its own high cost structure and complicated operations across 
three Scandinavian countries. It is more focused on short-haul flights than many other flag carriers, leaving it more 
exposed to low-cost rivals who have lured away lucrative business customers.
Spain's Iberia is also fighting for survival and a number of large European airlines are looking to cut costs in a year 
that has already seen Spanair and Hungary's Malev go bankrupt.
The latest plan reflects the exasperation of the government shareholders, which have participated in two rights 
issues in 2009 and 2010. Attempts to sell SAS have foundered in recent years as well.
SAS gives staff six days to agree pay and pension cuts
Mr Gustafson, whose own pay will be cut by 20 per cent, said the airline intended to sell SKr3bn in assets, including 
its ground handling and Norwegian regional airline, Widerøe. The restructuring should boost pre-tax earnings by 
SKr3bn annually, on top of SKr5bn of savings announced a year ago, by cutting the workforce from 15,000 to 
9,000.
The trigger for the move is an imminent pensions accounting change that SAS has warned could wipe out almost all 
of its shareholder equity by reducing it by up to SKr10.7bn. SAS said the proposed changes to workers' pensions 
would reduce the hit to equity by SKr2.8bn.

Loss-making airline SAS will shed nearly 6,000 staff through cuts and asset sales to secure loans from banks and 
Nordic governments to help it survive a global downturn and fierce competition.
SAS, one of the European flag-carriers being squeezed by discount carriers such as Ryanair and Norwegian, has 
not made a full-year profit since 2007. Without the loans, SAS might have to stop flying.
It said 800 jobs would be cut and the sales of regional airline Wideroe and the group's ground handling unit would 
reduce staff to around 9,000 in total from 15,000 now.
Announcing its new savings plan on Monday, it said it expected a slight pretax loss again this year. "This truly is our 
'final call' if there is to be a SAS in the future," said SAS chief executive Rickard Gustafson. The group said it aimed 
to improve earnings by 3 billion crowns by cutting costs while asset sales would strengthen the company's balance 
sheet by 3 billion crowns. The new credit facility is worth around 3.5 billion crowns. The credit, being provided by 
seven banks and the governments of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, is conditional on signing agreements with 
unions on the job and wage cuts and getting parliamentary approval where necessary. Gustafson said the company 
needed to get the deal with unions in place in a week. The company said in a statement it would sell Norwegian unit 
Wideroe, aircraft engines, some real estate and the group's ground handling unit. "I know that we are asking a lot of 
our employees, but there is no other way. I hope that our loyal and dedicated employees are willing to fight for the 
survival of SAS and for our jobs," Gustafson added in the statement. Staff will take pay cuts of up to 17 percent, 
depending on what part of the organisation they work in. Cabin staff will see their pay reduced on average by 12 
percent. Gustafson said he would take a 20 percent cut. (C ) Reuters

Body
(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY, RYA.L), Europe's ultra low fares airline, welcomed the announcement 
by IAG/Iberia that it intends to acquire Vueling. Ryanair stated that this latest airline merger mirrors the EU 
Commission's Phase 1 approved merger of IAG/British Airways with British Midland in March 2012, Aegean's 
recent takeover offer for Olympic in Greece and Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus, which is currently being reviewed by 
the EU Competition Authorities.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "The merger of IAG Iberia and Vueling is another logical merger of EU airlines 
operating in the same market and mirrors IAG/British Airways takeover of BMI in the UK earlier this year, Aegean's 
offer for Olympic in Greece and Ryanair's current offer for Aer Lingus in Ireland. As Europe's flag carrier airlines 
continue to consolidate Ryanair believes that its offer for Aer Lingus should be approved by the EU Competition 
Authorities if they follow - fairly - the precedent set in the BA/BMI merger and last weeks takeover of Vueling in 
Spain by BA/IAG. These are all inevitable steps in the consolidation process of Europe's high fares former flag 
carrier airlines."

The EU is to serve formal objections against Ryanair's t hird proposed takeover of Aer Lingus , after Europe's 
largest low-cost carrier by revenues failed to offer concessions that address all Brussels' competition concerns 
about the deal.
The European Commission has made clear it will reject what Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, described 
as a "radical" and "unprecedented" remedies package.
According to people involved in the talks, Ryanair has been told that the remedies package falls short of what is 
required to eliminate competition concerns on all routes where the merged Irish carrier would enjoy a dominant 
position. Although Ryanair said last week that it had found airlines willing to provide -competition on routes that 
would otherwise be dominated by the merged Irish carrier, the commission concluded that the offer was so 
unsatisfactory that it has not asked rival airlines to comment on the details - a usual step in assessing significant 
concessions.
The issuance of a so-called "statement of objections" by the commission will take Ryanair one step closer to its bid 
being blocked.
In 2007, the commission prohibited Ryanair's first tilt at Aer Lingus on the grounds it would harm consumers by 
creating a near monopoly on some 35 routes to and from Ireland.
Ryanair can improve its offer to the commission at any time. After formal objections are issued, it will have an 
opportunity to challenge the findings and hold a hearing on the deal.
The commission declined to comment.
People involved with the talks insist the commission is keeping an open mind and ensuring Ryanair has every 
chance to prove the bid for Aer Lingus can pass the competition test, not least because officials want to ensure the 
decision is legally watertight.
Ryanair remedies on Aer Lingus bid fail to impress EU regulators
The provisional deadline for a commission decision is early February. It is extremely rare for the commission to 
prohibit mergers and it has never before approved a takeover that is resubmitted.
Mr O'Leary said that he had received "no feedback" from the commission   but added he believed Brussels would 
find it "very difficult" to reject the proposed remedies package.

The big story
US Democrats were happy with **Barack Obama's**win, but the same couldn't be said of equity investors, who 
promptly sold stocks on Wednesday after the result was confirmed. Both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices lost 
nearly 2.5 per cent in their biggest single-day drops all year. On the upside for equities, with Mitt Romney out of the 
picture there is no danger of Fed chairman Ben Bernanke getting the boot, so it's quantitative easing all the way -- 
for as long as it takes.
.........................
**Bull run**
**Ryanair**gave European aviation regulators something to think about when it produced a surprisingly strong set 
of results for the first half of the year. Profits at the low-cost airline, which is trying to take over Aer Lingus, rose by 
10 per cent, and chief executive Michael O'Leary raised full year earnings guidance from EUR 400 million-EUR 440 
million to EUR 490 million-EUR 520 million.
.........................
**Bear market**
The punters love **Apple's**products, but investors don't seem to like their shares much these days. The stock 
price for the iconic maker of iPads and iPhones has taken a beating since September, when it reached an all-time 
high of $705, shedding more than 20 per cent of their value. Analysts are blaming the slide on a combination of 
factors, including declining profit margins and unspectacular product performance in a competitive market for 
smartphones and tablets. But proposed increases in capital gains taxes in the US are also said to be a factor.

If Iberia's flights arrived as late as its restructuring, the Spanish airline would have been grounded long ago. The 
cutbacks announced yesterday - reducing its fleet by about a quarter and its workforce by a fifth - are more savage 
for being so delayed. The airline says it must achieve a profitability turnround of at least EUR600m by 2015. It made 
an operating loss of EUR262m in the nine months to September, and is burning through EUR1.7m of cash daily. So 
Iberia is clearly fighting for survival.
The airline's problem is not just Spain's dire economic situation, though that provides sombre mood music. Its real 
problem is that it is not competitive. Iberia is a high-cost, full-service airline in a low-cost, no-frills market. Its 
competitors are Ryanair and easyJet in the short-haul market, and Latam - product of a merger of Brazilian and 
Chilean airlines - in long haul. International Airlines Group, its parent, wants Iberia to match group return on capital 
of 12 per cent. In other words, it is time Iberia started pulling its weight in IAG. So much for the "merger of equals" 
with BA.
There are two glimmers of hope for Iberia. One is to integrate Vueling - the Barcelona-based low-cost carrier of 
which IAG bought full control this week - as the platform for Iberia's short-haul operations. Vueling's unit costs are 
10 per cent below those of easyJet and on a par with Iberia's existing low-cost carrier, according to Credit Suisse. 
The second is to leverage Iberia's strength in linking Europe to Latin America. But the execution risks associated 
with restructuring a legacy flag carrier are considerable. There is likely to be fierce trade union and political 
opposition to Iberia's plan in Spain.
BA turned its fortunes round before the IAG merger; that is what Iberia needs to do now. The risk is that it is rushing 
to catch a flight that has closed.

Crédit Agricole capped a difficult week for European banks yesterday as it reported a wider than expected net loss 
following the sale of its Greek unit.
The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended flat on the final session of a volatile week at 1,097.18. Over the 
week, the index fell 1.6 per cent.
Crédit Agricole led a list of financial services groups lower. Its stock shed 5.9 per cent to EUR5.57 after posting a 
EUR2.85bn loss in the third quarter as it paid heavily to end operations in Greece and booked losses on the 
valuation of other assets.
The bank, which incurred EUR1.96bn in charges on the sale of Greek unit Emporiki Bank and EUR181m on the 
divestment of its Cheuvreux broking unit, added that offers for its 20 per cent stake in Italy's Bankinter had been 
disappointing.
A poor week for banks left Crédit Agricole's shares down 6.9 per cent over the five sessions, but there were worse 
performances elsewhere during the week.
Commerzbank fell 5.9 per cent to EUR1.33 and was down 12.5 per cent over the week after the German lender 
said on Thursday it was unlikely to pay a dividend until 2014 and that it did not expect profit from its retail unit next 
year.
Domestic rival Deutsche Bank also had a tough week, falling 5.9 per cent to EUR33.52 over the five sessions, 
while Spanish banks BBVA and Santander   fell 6 per cent to EUR6.11 and 5.6 per cent to EUR5.52 respectively.
Irish airline Ryanair made the best weekly performance, up 8.4 per cent to EUR4.93, after it raised its full-year 
targets on Monday. It posted 15 per cent growth in third-quarter revenues.

The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index ended flat on the final session of a volatile week at 1,097.18. Over the 
week, the index fell 1.6 per cent.
Following the excitement of the US presidential election, investors appeared to refocus on the miserable state of the 
eurozone economy. Analysts suggested also that the rising proportion of corporate earnings failing to match market 
expectations were prompting suspicions that equity valuations may have become stretched following the recent 
rally.

A poor week for banks left Crédit Agricole's shares down 6.9 per cent over the five sessions, but there were worse 
performances elsewhere during the week after many of Europe's biggest lenders reported a poor third quarter. 
Crédit Agricole is not alone on the divestment trail, as many banks have either refocused on core domestic 
operations, or have hived off investment banking from retail. This effort to cut costs and restructure has made 
comparisons with previous years' profit statements difficult.

International Airlines Group warned yesterday that Iberia, its lossmaking Spanish subsidiary , was in a "fight for 
survival" and revealed sweeping plans to cut 4,500 jobs at the Madrid-based carrier.
The reduction amounts to more than 20 per cent of Iberia's workforce, but IAG said there could be deeper cuts if 
the company did not reach agreement with trade unions by the end of January.
The unions responded by threatening strike action, but Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, insisted that he was 
ready to deal with a "winter of discontent".
"Iberia is in a fight for survival and we will transform it to reduce its cost base so it can grow profitably in the future," 
he said.
IAG, formed from the merger of British Airways and Iberia last year, expects to record an operating loss of 
EUR120m for 2012, principally because of the Spanish unit's problems.
Mr Walsh, British Airways' former chief executive, said he had no regrets over the merger with Iberia. However, he 
stressed that IAG was not planning more deals following its bid to secure control of Vueling, the Spanish low-cost 
carrier.
Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, denounced Iberia's turnround plan, saying: "We are completely aghast at a plan 
that wants to destroy Iberia."
The union organised a series of strikes at the end of last year and early this year in protest at Iberia's creation of a 
new budget carrier called Iberia Express, where staff are paid less than at the main airline.
Sepla's members are restricted from striking while arbitration is under way over the Iberia Express dispute, but 
Justo Peral, head of the union's Iberia section, warned: "We are not going to negotiate this turnround plan."
Iberia in fight for survival as parent plans 4,500 job cuts
For the nine months to September 30, IAG reported a loss before tax of EUR169m, compared with a profit of 
EUR355m in the same period last year. While British Airways recorded an operating profit of EUR286m in the first 
three quarters of this year, Iberia made a loss of EUR262m.
As well as the Spanish recession, Iberia's short-haul operations are struggling with aggressive competition from 
low-cost airlines led by Ryanair, while its long-haul network to Latin America is up against stronger rivals such as 
Latam Airline Group, the new carrier formed from a merger of Brazilian and Chilean airlines.
Iberia is burning up cash at a rate of EUR1.7m each day. The turnround plan aims to halt the cash bleed by the 
middle of next year and return the carrier to profit by 2014.
The 4,500 job losses would affect pilots, cabin crew and other staff, and the remaining 15,500 staff face salary 
reductions. Iberia is also cutting capacity by 15 per cent by scrapping lossmaking routes and removing 25 aircraft 
from its 110-strong fleet.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espírito Santo, described the Iberia restructuring as "radical", but said the problems at the 
carrier were "systemic".
"We continue to believe the market has underestimated the scale and nature of the challenge faced by Iberia," he 
said.
For the three months to September 30, IAG reported revenue of EUR5.1bn, up 12.6 per cent compared with the 
same period last year, and operating profit after exceptional items of EUR263m, down 25 per cent.
IAG's shares rose 1.5 per cent to 170.6p.

From Mr Alistair Craig.
Sir, I enjoyed reading John Kay's article "London's new airport held to ransom by folly" (November 7) but am 
intrigued by his assertion about Stansted's inadequacies. I have used Stansted and perhaps, if only from the tone of 
his article, may have overflown Prof Kay in the process.
Stansted has, in fact, excellent rail communications both to the City of London, where most of your UK readership 
probably work, and to Cambridge and Birmingham. That rail network will shortly be connected to Crossrail, linking it 
both with the City and the west of London, and could also be upgraded to high-speed at relatively little expense. 
The airport lies on the M11 and is close to the M25.
The fact that some airlines, most of them considerably less successful than Ryanair and easyJet, have been 
reluctant to use it would only support the argument that the market does not always recognise a good thing when it 
sees it.
Prof Kay's reference to Mr Justice Roskill's conclusion in 1968 that too many flight paths cross London was a gem 
that still holds good. Why so many Londoners, who provide the financial lifeblood of this country, should be 
disturbed in their homes by non-visiting hub-users is anyone's guess.
As a keen reader of the FT, I have noticed that since the summer you have published articles and reports generally 
supporting or referring to expansion at Heathrow, the most recent being four runways rather than three. I hope that 
this only reflects successful lobbying and not editorial concerns about the possible future relocation of flight paths 
that millions of those living in London currently have to endure.

International Airlines Group is today expected to unveil a wide-ranging restructuring of Iberia, its lossmaking 
Spanish subsidiary, after agreeing to acquire full ownership of Barcelona-based low-cost carrier Vueling.
Analysts are predicting that 4,000 jobs could be axed at Iberia, which is set to be boosted by the EUR113m deal to 
take control of its domestic low-cost rival. The restructuring will be outlined by Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive.
IAG was formed from the merger of British Airways and Iberia last year, but has quickly run into difficulties because 
of the Spanish unit's troubles . IAG expects to record an operating loss this year.
Iberia has been reporting operating losses for three years, partly because its short-haul operations are reeling from 
low-cost competitors led by Ryanair and easyJet.
In March, IAG started Iberia Express, a budget carrier paying lower salaries than the main Iberia airline. But Sepla, 
the Spanish pilots' union, responded by organising a series of strikes .
Andrew Light, an analyst at Citi, said IAG's acquisition of Vueling would put pressure on the unions to accept cost-
cutting at Iberia's short-haul operations or risk seeing them close down.
IAG yesterday proposed to buy the 54 per cent of Vueling it does not already own through a cash tender offer 
priced at EUR7 per share - a 28 per cent premium to the closing price on November 7.
IAG's shares closed down almost 1 per cent at 168p yesterday. Vueling's shares were up 25 per cent at EUR6.85.

Aer Lingus claims it has been forced to spend EUR50m in legal and consultancy fees to fight Ryanair's repeated 
takeover bids - but it remains confident that European authorities will block the rival airline's latest approach.
"The whole bureaucracy of a takeover approach means a huge amount of money spent defending ourselves," said 
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, after the company released third-quarter results yesterday. "This is 
more than we have ever paid to shareholders in dividends."
Ryanair's EUR1.30-a-share bid for Aer Lingus is the company's third attempt to take over its Irish rival in six years. 
In 2007, the European Commission prohibited Ryanair's first takeover bid for Aer Lingus, saying the combined 
entity would have harmed consumers by creating a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes to and from 
Ireland.
To support its latest bid, Ryanair has submitted a draft remedies package to the commission , which involves 
getting other airlines to commit to take over 35 routes to Europe where the proposed takeover would result in a 
monopoly situation.
But Mr Mueller said he felt sure Brussels would still block the takeover. "We have always believed that, with 85 per 
cent of routes overlapping, a takeover would lead to a monopoly," he explained. "I believe an 85 per cent route 
overlap cannot be mitigated [by remedies]."
In its results statement, Aer Lingus reported a slight fall in operating profits in the three months to September 30, 
compared with the same period last year . It said business demand for its core London route had weakened during 
the Olympic Games, and fuel and airport charges had increased.
Nevertheless, the Irish airline said it had a strong quarter with revenues growing and forward bookings stronger 
than they were at the same period last year.
Aer Lingus in EUR50m flight from Ryanair
Revenues in the period were up by 5.7 per cent year-on-year, to EUR460.8m, driven by a strong performance in its 
long-haul business.
But operating costs rose 8.1 per cent to EUR369.9m, as higher fuel prices and a weakening euro lifted overall fuel 
costs 27.7 per cent. As a result, operating profit in the third quarter fell to EUR90.9m, from EUR93.6m in the same 
period in 2011.
Aer Lingus also said it was bracing itself for possible industrial action. Unions have served strike notice on Aer 
Lingus and are planning a two-hour work stoppage on November 19 at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports as part 
of a dispute over how to deal with a EUR748m deficit in an employee pension scheme.
Mr Mueller said he was optimistic that a strike could be averted, following talks with unions. He said Aer Lingus was 
willing to part-fund a new contributory pension scheme.

IAG eyes move on low-cost Spanish carrier

International Airlines Group said yesterday it was considering seeking full ownership of Vueling, the Spanish low-
cost carrier.
Analysts said IAG's potential move was part of its efforts to try to improve the competitiveness of Iberia, the group's 
troubled Spanish subsidiary.
IAG was formed through the merger of British Airways and Iberia in 2011, and the group expected to report an 
operating loss this year because of the Spanish unit's problems.
Iberia reported an operating loss of EUR263m in the six months to June 30, and Willie Walsh, IAG's chief 
executive, is set to reveal a far-reaching restructuring of the airline tomorrow that unions fear could involve 
thousands of job losses.
Iberia owns 46 per cent of Vueling, which has a market capitalisation of EUR171m.
IAG said it "can confirm that it is considering making an offer for 100 per cent of the share capital of Vueling", 
adding that its board would consider the matter today. IAG stressed no final decisions had been taken, including on 
the offer price, and would not comment further. Vueling declined to comment.
Iberia is suffering partly because of the Spanish recession, but its short and medium-haul operations are under 
acute pressure from competitors led by Ryanair.
In March, IAG started Iberia Express, a low-cost, short-haul carrier at which staff were paid less than at the main 
Iberia airline, but the new group's future had become mired in legal uncertainty.
Sepla, the Spanish pilots' union, called a series of strikes at the end of last year in protest at the establishment of 
Iberia Express, and Spain's government intervened by sending the whole issue to arbitration.
IAG eyes move on low-cost Spanish carrier
IAG objected to a May ruling that required Iberia to put all its pilots on the same pay scale, and this week a Spanish 
court declared the arbitration process flawed.
Analysts said IAG might drop Iberia Express and develop Vueling as its low-cost, short-haul carrier. Vueling could 
also provide feeder traffic for the main airline's long-haul operations, which are heavily focused on Latin America.
Vueling reported revenue of EUR882.7m for the nine months to September 30, and a net profit of EUR41.3m.
Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said: "There is a risk of legal wrangles preventing IAG from 
expanding Iberia Express as quickly as it would like and a bid for Vueling may provide another solution to the 
challenges facing Iberia in short-haul."

Aer Lingus claims it has been forced to spend EUR50m in legal and consultancy fees to fight Ryanair's repeated 
takeover bids - but it remains confident European authorities will block the rival airline's latest approach, writes 
Jamie Smyth in Dublin .
"The whole bureaucracy of a takeover approach means a huge amount of money spent defending ourselves," said 
Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus chief executive, after the group released third-quarter results. "This is more than we 
have ever paid to shareholders in dividends."
Ryanair's EUR1.30-a-share bid for Aer Lingus is the airline's third attempt to take over its Irish rival in six years. But 
Mr Mueller said he was sure Brussels would block the move once again over monopoly concerns, despite Ryanair's 
draft remedies package.
In its results statement, Aer Lingus said operating profit in the third quarter fell to EUR90.9m, from EUR93.6m in the 
same period in 2011, after business demand for its core London route weakened during the Olympics, and fuel and 
airport charges increased.
Revenues in the period were up by 5.7 per cent year on year, to EUR460.8m.

Aer Lingus has reported a ''strong'' operating profit of E90.9m for the three months to the end of September.
The airline said that operating profits for the year to date are now E86.5m, 29.7pc ahead of the same time last year.
It said its passenger revenue for the third quarter was 5.5pc ahead of the third quarter in 2011, on the back of 
positive variances in yield and load factor.
''This positive revenue performance helped to offset the impact of higher fuel and airport charges,'' Aer Lingus said 
in a statement.
The airline's total passenger numbers in the third quarter (including Aer Lingus Regional) increased by 2pc, while 
the overall yield per passenger increased by 7.2pc. It noted that long haul yields remained particularly strong, 
increasing by 11.5pc on the previous year. "The positive result reflects the on-going success of our strategy to 
manage capacity deployment across the network, concentrating on serving higher yielding, time sensitive demand 
and continuing to focus on cost reduction. I am particularly proud that our team has achieved this result against the 
backdrop of the third Ryanair offer for the group,'' commented Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller. ( C )

Body
London's airports are operating close to capacity. Noise levels around Heathrow are unacceptable. The location of 
Heathrow requires that too many flight paths cross the centre of London. Any proposed solution to these problems 
attracts vociferous objection. What is needed is an independent, radical review of options, which will not report 
before the next election.
This is not a story from 2012, but from 1968. The inquiry established then was chaired by Mr Justice Roskill. The 
one just commissioned is to be chaired by Sir Howard Davies. Not much else has changed - except that London's 
airports then catered for 15m passengers. The Roskill Commission anticipated rapid growth in air transport, 
speculating that by the end of the century London might have to accommodate 100m passengers. Not a bad 
estimate; the actual number was 115m.
The commission concluded that a new airport should be built to the northwest of London at Cublington, between 
Aylesbury and Milton Keynes, with matching improvements to road and rail links. The report is a model of 
dispassionate analysis. Although its reliance on cost benefit analysis was widely criticised, that analysis was not 
employed to make decisions but used as a guide to the careful organisation of evidence. The contrast between the 
work of the commission and the dismal quality of the material supporting the proposed new high-speed rail link to 
Birmingham is a measure of how far standards of evidence in policy making have declined.
Not that the excellence of the Roskill Commission's work did them or us much good. A government of different 
complexion rejected its findings immediately. A scheme to build an airport at Foulness, on Maplin Sands in the 
Thames Estuary, was chosen instead. This option had been considered by Roskill and decisively rejected. The new 
airport was too expensive to build, too far from London and on the wrong side of the city for most prospective 
passengers. The poor location would not only greatly increase travel times but also lead airlines to use other 
airports to the south and west of London, or on the continent of Europe.
Neither Foulness nor Cublington was built. The complexion of the government changed yet again. After some 
delay, another scheme was devised: a limited expansion of an existing airport at Stansted, near Cambridge. More 
London's new airport has been held to ransom by folly and delay
than a decade later, the newly privatised British Airports Authority used the money generated from its cash cow at 
Heathrow to finance that project.
Stansted was also considered by Roskill, but never made the shortlist of serious options and has been a predictable 
failure. No airline has successfully operated long-haul flights from it. The expansive and expensive Norman Foster 
terminal was saved from being a white elephant by the growth in the 1990s of low-cost airlines, for whom attractive 
landing charges at Stansted offset the inconvenience to their passengers of getting there. The principal carrier is 
Ryanair.
Cublington was almost certainly the right answer in 1971 when Roskill reported. It might still be the right answer but 
the scale and complexity now involved in creating a wholly new facility in the English countryside would be orders of 
magnitude greater. Delay has multiplied the constraints and while Roskill was faced with a menu of choices, Sir 
Howard confronts one with no palatable dishes at all. And whatever the government decides after his work is 
completed, aircraft will disturb the residents of west London for many years yet, and travellers will continue to circle 
the city as business flights from newly emerging economies land at Paris and Frankfurt.
One might feel consoled if there were even slight signs that the lessons of bad policy making had been learnt. But 
the prevarication and political posturing, the persistent incrementalism when bold actions are required, the 
readiness to oppose policies simply because they have been espoused by somebody else, are as characteristic of 
policy today as they have been for the past 50 years. Models are more elaborate but less useful, and grossly 
misused. And, as Roskill pointed out, the 100,000 people who might have been adversely affected by a rational 
policy are encouraged to shout far louder than the 100m who would benefit.

LOW COST carriers EasyJet and Aer Lingus posted passenger growth for October yesterday, though both showed 
signs of slowing momentum.
EasyJet said passenger traffic rose 6.2 per cent to 5.25m in October, but this growth is lower than the seven per 
cent increase seen over the past year.
The carrier's load factor, a measure of how well it fills planes, fell 0.4 percentage points to 88.4 per cent.
EasyJet has opened a string of new routes over the last year, and hopes to begin flights to Moscow next year.
Aer Lingus, which reports third quarter results today, said its October traffic rose 0.9 per cent on a year ago to hit 
962,000.
Its growing long haul services saw a 10.3 per cent jump in traffic to 86,000. Passenger numbers on regional flights 
also took off, rising 34 per cent on last year to 89,000.
These gains were offset by a 2.7 per cent slide in short haul traffic to 787,000 passengers.
Year to date, Aer Lingus has enjoyed a 3.7 per cent increase in traffic to 9.16m.
The Irish airline is trying to fend off takeover interest from larger rival Ryanair, which said on Monday it is willing to 
offer regulators more concessions in order to smooth the path of the (EURO)694m (£556m) deal.

Global economic weakness and subdued consumer confidence had little impact on Ryanair 's first-half results and 
sent the shares to the top of a struggling FTSE Eurofirst 300 yesterday.
The Irish airline jumped 5.8 per cent to EUR4.81 after reporting a 15 per cent rise in revenues to EUR3.1bn in the 
six months to the end of September, while lower fuel costs helped boost net profit by 10 per cent to EUR596m.
But the FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.6 per cent to 1,108.58 as investors turned cautious ahead of a packed calendar of 
economic and political events, which include Thursday's meeting of the governing council of the European Central 
Bank.
Shares in the eurozone periphery fell the most sharply. Spain's Ibex 35 fell 1.9 per cent to 7,818.6, led lower by 
banks after the ECB said it might have contravened its own lending terms on loans to Spanish financial institutions.
BBVA fell 3.1 per cent to EUR6.30, while Bankia shed 3 per cent to EUR1.16.
The FTSE MIB index fell 1.4 per cent to 15,544.4, as banks were also weaker on the Milan exchange.
TNT Express fell 1.9 per cent to EUR7.94 after the Dutch logistics company's biggest shareholder PostNL 
reported a third-quarter loss and was doubtful whether it would pay a dividend.
PostNL fell 11 per cent to EUR2.77 after it reported operating losses of EUR128m, due to one-off costs and a 
decline in the value of its 30 per cent stake in TNT.
German mail and logistics group Deutsche Post fell 2.1 per cent to EUR15.32 after the country's competition 
authority said it was investigating allegations of price undercutting that may have forced rivals out of the mail 
delivery market.
Shares in Transocean , the Swiss offshore drilling company, climbed 4.5 per cent to SFr45.51 after the company 
reported forecast-beating third-quarter results.

Recession traditionally favours no-frills airlines as fliers prune travel costs. But add in current capacity restraint at 
European flag carriers - Lufthansa's capacity, for example, was flat this summer and is expected to dip 2 per cent 
this winter - and low-cost rivals have extra flexibility.
The benefits were clear yesterday when Ryanair reported a 15 per cent jump in revenues for the six months to the 
end of September, at EUR3.1bn, with after-tax profits rising 10 per cent to EUR600m. Passenger numbers were up 
7 per cent year on year. But the Irish carrier also pushed through fare increases averaging 6 per cent.
Better still, ancillary revenues rose by a fifth to EUR585m, largely thanks to some passengers' willingness to pay for 
reserved seats or priority boarding. The result: an impressive 7 per cent yield increase. The cost side, meanwhile, 
was kept commendably tight: aside from a 24 per cent fuel bill jump, to EUR1.1bn, unit costs rose just 2 per cent.
Can Ryanair keep this up? With legacy carriers such as Lufthansa and Air France-KLM restructuring, survival 
issues hanging over some smaller European airlines, and the low-cost carrier itself grounding 80 aircraft again this 
winter, the short-term answer should be yes. Whether Ryanair's long-term target of 50 per cent growth in 
passengers and market share in the next decade can be achieved is harder to assess - although betting against the 
carrier has rarely been wise.
But the question for investors is whether Ryanair is now the best place to put their money given current sector 
dynamics. Its shares, up 6 per cent yesterday, trade on 15 times 2012-13 consensus earnings and 13 times the 
2013-14 figure. EasyJet, which stands to gain from the same trends, is on 10 times consensus earnings for 2012-
13. Ryanair's record and strong balance sheet deserve a premium. But the differential is starting to look pricey.

RYANAIR, Europe's biggest budget airline, yesterday raised its full-year profit forecast after higher fares, lower than 
expected fuel costs and a surge in demand after the Olympics helped it beat first-half expectations.
The Ireland-based airline, waiting to hear whether EU regulators will approve its takeover of domestic peer Aer 
Lingus, also said it was benefiting from the demise of European rivals such as Spanair and Hungarian firm Malev.
Many airlines have been hit hard by Europe's struggling economy and high fuel costs. Ryanair has fared better than 
most, thanks to its size and focus on low costs and low prices.
"It was a strong performance after the Olympic Games, we certainly saw an upward rise in average fares. Many 
people who appeared to stay at home ... came back in force post the Olympic Games," finance chief Howard Millar 
said.
Ryanair said its fares rose six per cent in the six months ended September, while passenger numbers surged seven 
per cent.
As a result, it lifted its profit forecast for the year ending March 2013 to (EURO)490-520m (£392m-£416m) from its 
previous guidance of (EURO)400-440m.
Ryanair said its first-half net profit rose to (EURO)596m from (EURO)544m a year ago and ahead of analyst 
expectations at (EURO)564m. Revenue jumped 15 per cent to (EURO)3.1bn.
Ryanair makes most of its money from leisure travellers and normally records a loss in its seasonally quieter 
second half.

Ryanair raised its profit guidance for 2012-13 and talked up the prospect of placing a big order for new aircraft as 
other airlines collapse or scale back their European short-haul operations.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, said he was in talks with Boeing 
about the possibility of a cut-price deal on current-generation 737 single-aisle aircraft.
He also insisted that the European Commission should approve Ryanair's contentious bid for Aer Lingus , saying 
he had reached agreements with at least two airlines willing to provide competition on routes where the merged 
Irish carrier would have a dominant position. He declined to identify the airlines.
Ryanair is enjoying a strong performance during Europe's economic downturn, partly because more consumers are 
turning to the Irish budget carrier.
Ryanair is also expanding as some airlines fail, such as Hungary's Malev, and it continues to put pressure on the 
short-haul operations of Europe's main flag carriers, led by Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and International Airlines 
Group.
"A lot of the growth of the next five to 10 years will come from replacing high-fare, lossmaking short-haul flights 
operated by flag carriers and switching them to Ryanair," said Mr O'Leary.
He announced a target for Ryanair to increase its share of the European short-haul passenger market from 12 per 
cent in 2012-13 to 18 per cent in 10 years' time.
Andrew Light, analyst at Citi, said the target implied Ryanair would increase its fleet from 300 aircraft to 450 by 
2022, and could order 300 new jets , because some would replace older models.
Mr O'Leary said he was looking to place an aircraft order in 2016 or 2017, adding that much of Ryanair's growing 
cash pile could be used to pay for the jets, rather than debt. At September 30, the airline had gross cash of 
EUR3.9bn.
Ryanair says profits set to soar TRAVEL & LEISURE
Mr O'Leary went on to claim Ryanair might secure a cut-price jet order by buying Boeing's current-generation 737 
narrow-body aircraft rather than a planned new version featuring more fuel-efficient engines.
Ryanair reported revenue of EUR3.1bn for the six months to September 30, up 15 per cent compared with the 
same time last year.
Pre-tax profit rose 10 per cent to EUR679.3m, and earnings per share were EUR0.41, compared with EUR0.37 a 
year ago.
Ryanair raised its net profit guidance for 2012-13 to between EUR490m and EUR520m, from a previous range of 
EUR400m to EUR440m. The airline's shares closed almost unchanged at EUR4.81 yesterday.
Mr O'Leary raised concerns about bids for Stansted airport by Manchester Airports Group and TPG, the private 
equity firm founded by David Bonderman, who is also Ryanair's chairman.
He said he would prefer alternative bids for Stansted, including one by Macquarie, the Australian bank, because it 
would seek lower returns on the airport than MAG or TPG.
BAA, the airport operator, has been forced to sell Stansted by regulators, and Ryanair is the largest airline there.

Ryanair raises outlook as profits rise 10 pct

European airline Ryanair reported stronger-than-expected half-year profits Monday and raised its outlook for the full 
year as its cost-conscious business model continued to attract customers hit by the region's economic crisis.
The Dublin-based airline said its net profit from April to September rose 10 percent to (EURO)596 million ($775 
million) from the same period a year ago. Sales increased 15 percent to (EURO)3.11 billion as average fares rose 6 
percent.
As a result, Ryanair said it would raise its full-year profit guidance to a range of (EURO)490 million to (EURO)520 
million about 20 percent higher than previous forecasts because of strong sales during the key summer months, 
particularly after the August conclusion of the London Olympics.
Ryanair shares surged 7 percent to (EURO)4.90 ($6.37) in early trade on the Irish Stock Exchange.
The carrier said it still should record losses during the quieter second half of the fiscal year and would ground about 
80 of its 298-aircraft fleet, chiefly in Britain and Ireland, to reduce fuel costs.
Passenger volume rose 7 percent to a new half-year record of 48 million. The airline said this represents 12 percent 
of all passengers on European routes.
And the airline, which has grown from a single British-Irish route in 1985 to become the biggest short-haul carrier in 
Europe, emphasized it expects to keep building market share at the expense of higher-priced rivals.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair was aiming to carry 120 million people annually by 2022 as 
competitors merge, contract and fail.
He noted this year's shutdowns of Sicilian airline Windjet, Poland's OLT Express, Britain's bmibaby, Hungary's 
Malev and Spain's Spanair, all of them Ryanair hubs or growing destinations.
Ryanair raises outlook as profits rise 10 pct
"Further airline failures and consolidations are inevitable given the fragmentation among European airlines and the 
existence of so many high-cost, high-fare airlines with poor punctuality records. In this environment Ryanair sees 
substantial opportunities to grow," he said.
Ryanair offered no news on its efforts to acquire its main Irish rival, Aer Lingus. It has launched three hostile bids 
since Aer Lingus' privatization in 2006 but has yet to win essential backing from the Irish government, Aer Lingus 
unions or European Union regulators.
O'Leary said he was confident this year's offer would be accepted by all three parties, partly because Ireland's 
government needs to sell assets as part of its efforts to emerge from an international emergency-loan program 
before those funds run out next year.
Ryanair is Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder with a 30 percent stake, while the government has 25 percent and Aer 
Lingus employee-controlled trusts more than 10 percent.
"Ryanair is determined to explore all commercial options to address any competition concerns the EU may have in 
order to secure approval for its proposed merger," O'Leary said.
Analysts, however, doubt that O'Leary can win over either the Irish government or EU competition authorities given 
a merged group would be likely to control around four-fifths of all flights in and out of Ireland.
Aer Lingus shares rose 2 percent Monday to (EURO)1.08 ($1.40), nowhere near Ryanair's June offer of 
(EURO)1.30 per share.
Aer Lingus has been forced by Ryanair competition to pare its costs strongly but still is a substantially different 
business. Unlike Ryanair it struggles to post only moderate profits; recognizes unions in often-fractious 
negotiations; operates Airbus rather than Boeing aircraft; has strategic slots at London's Heathrow Airport that other 
airlines covet; and is a trans-Atlantic as well as European carrier with several U.S. routes.
O'Leary says these differences do not matter, because Ryanair would run Aer Lingus as a separate company and 
keep all these operational differences intact.

A jump of just under 6pc in Ryanair's shares led a resurgent ISEQ today as investors cheered the airline's stellar 
half year performance.
The ISEQ rose 40.72 points to 3,353,76.
Ryanair this morning posted H1 net profit that was up 10pc to E596m compared to analysts' consensus forecasts of 
E564m. This implies Q2 profits of E496.8m compared to Davy'sforecast of E443.7m. Q2 revenues increased by 
17pc to E1,822.2m, driven by a 7pc increase in yields and an 8pc rise in passenger numbers. Ancillary revenues 
rose by 25pc due to the combination of an improved product mix, the roll-out of reserved seating and higher 
internet-related revenues. Unit costs ex-fuel rose by 2pc, including fuel by 6pc. Operating margins increased 1 point 
to 32pc. "Ryanair remains by some distance the lowest-cost producer in the industry, has c.12pc of the European 
short-haul market and sees the potential to grow profitably to 120m passengers per annum over the next ten years. 
With its cash generative, low-cost model and indeed increasing returns (c.15pc ROIC), we continue to rate the 
airline 'Outperform' and increase our price target to E5.5 (from E5)," said analyst, Stephen Furlong. Ryanair's 
shares jumped 26c to E4.81.
Irish listed financial services group, IFG, today said it will make good on its promise to return E37.3m to its 
shareholders via a tender offer. The Tender Offer is being made to Qualifying Shareholders at a price per share of 
E1.65 and tenders may be made at the Tender Price only. IFG shares rose 3c to E1.43.

Ryanair said profit in the first half jumped 10 percent, beating expectations thanks to higher fares and a lower fuel 
bill, prompting Europe's biggest budget airline to raise its guidance for full-year profit.
The Dublin-based airline, which is waiting to hear whether EU regulators will approve its takeover of Aer Lingus, 
said fares rose 6 percent in the second half, coupled with a surge in passenger numbers during the summer 
months.
"It was a strong performance after the Olympic Games, we certainly saw an upward rise in average fares. Many 
people who appeared to stay at home ... came back in force post the Olympic Games," Chief Financial Officer 
Howard Millar told Reuters.
Net profit for the six months to end-October rose to 596 million euros (dollar 765.6 million), from 544 million euros a 
year ago and ahead of analyst expectations at 564 million euros. Revenue surged 15 percent to 3.1 billion euros.
The airline lifted its forecast for the year to March to a profit of between of 490 million to 520 million euros from its 
previous guidance of 400 million to 440 million for the year to March. Ryanair said in a recent update on its bid to 
acquire rival Aer Lingus that it has offered concessions to European Union antitrust regulators in an effort to secure 
regulatory clearance. It has a Feb. 6 deadline for its decision on the 700 million euro (dollar 912 million) deal. 
Ryanair said it would not take part in the sale of London's Stansted airport last month, after the airport's owner BAA, 
excluded the budget airline from the process. Shares in European airlines Air France-KLM and Lufthansa both rose 
towards the end of last week after posting reassuring results on Thursday. ( C) Reuters

Aer Lingus is of strategic importance to export industry growth, the Irish Exporters (IEA) chief executive said today 
when asked about the latest Ryanair take over commentary.
The strategic importance of the Aer Lingus air cargo facility for high-tech and life sciences exporters has not been 
given enough consideration by the Government, according to the Association's chief executive, John Whelan at the 
launch of their Q3 Export Industry Review, which shows the main export growth coming from these sectors this 
year.
"The Aer Lingus flights to the US carry about 52pc of the value of our exports and 43pc of all imports from the US," 
he said.
"At risk is the E18bn of pharmaceutical and medical technology that is exported by airfreight to the US and E4.5bn 
of high-tech imports required for a wide range of manufacturing companies in Ireland. The daily airfreight 
connection to the US has been at the heart of Irish export growth for several decades. Let us not forget this is our 
largest export market as well as our main source of foreign direct investment. The daily airfreight link is a strategic 
trade corridor for Ireland and must be treated as such." Ryanair has a policy of not handling air cargo across its 
entire fleet, said the IEA who are very concerned that if they procured the dominant stake in Aer Lingus they would 
most likely drop air cargo handling. "This is not a risk that should be taken with any potential buyer of a majority 
stake in Aer Lingus," Mr Whelan added. The IEA also are concerned at the prospect of lack of competition on many 
routes in and out of Ireland and say there appears to be a case for Irish Competition Authority to aggressively 
investigate. It added that the current Aer Lingus strategy has transformed the airline into a demand led, network 
focused, value carrier, with partnerships and code sharing agreements which connect Ireland and its exporters to 
global markets. "Aer Lingus has shown profits since the new strategy was introduced in 2009 and is on track for 
profits of E49 million this year .The Company is well managed and has gross cash balances of ca. E1 billion. The

investigate. It added that the current Aer Lingus strategy has transformed the airline into a demand led, network 
focused, value carrier, with partnerships and code sharing agreements which connect Ireland and its exporters to 
global markets. "Aer Lingus has shown profits since the new strategy was introduced in 2009 and is on track for 
profits of E49 million this year .The Company is well managed and has gross cash balances of ca. E1 billion. The 
Exporters worry about Ryanair AL comment AL Exports
IEA wish to see the continuity of two well-run Irish owned airlines operating out of Ireland, both Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus. The IEA believe this will ensure the best air cargo and passenger options for short and long haul for Irish 
export industry."

The ISEQ rose sharply this morning, lifted by what Davy called Ryanair's "blow out" half year profit figures.
By 12:45 the index was up 34.69 points to 3,347.73.
Ryanair this morning posted H1 net profit that was up 10pc to E596m compared to analysts' consensus forecasts of 
E564m. This implies Q2 profits of E496.8m compared to Davy'sforecast of E443.7m. Q2 revenues increased by 
17pc to E1,822.2m, driven by a 7pc increase in yields and an 8pc rise in passenger numbers. Ancillary revenues 
rose by 25pc due to the combination of an improved product mix, the roll-out of reserved seating and higher 
internet-related revenues. Unit costs ex-fuel rose by 2pc, including fuel by 6pc. Operating margins increased 1 point 
to 32pc. "Ryanair remains by some distance the lowest-cost producer in the industry, has c.12pc of the European 
short-haul market and sees the potential to grow profitably to 120m passengers per annum over the next ten years. 
With its cash generative, low-cost model and indeed increasing returns (c.15pc ROIC), we continue to rate the 
airline 'Outperform' and increase our price target to E5.5 (from E5)," said analyst, Stephen Furlong. Ryanair's 
shares jumped 29c to E4.84.
Irish listed financial services group, IFG, today said it will make good on its promise to return E37.3m to its 
shareholders via a tender offer. The Tender Offer is being made to Qualifying Shareholders at a price per share of 
E1.65 and tenders may be made at the Tender Price only. IFG shares rose 10c to E1.50.

The ISEQ is up this morning at 3,343, a rise of 30 points on the day and ahead of European markets as Ryanair 
brings in results well ahead of expectations. Goodbody Stockbrokers sees Ryanair as a Buy and explains why:
Ryanair reported Q2 numbers this morning which came in well ahead of our and consensus forecasts as yields, 
ancillaries and costs came in better than expected. Management has raised guidance for the full year to a range of 
E490m to E520m, from E400m to E440m. We expect the stock to perform well today on the back of these results.
Total revenue came in at E1,822m, 1.9pc ahead of Goodbody and 2.7pc ahead of consensus. Scheduled revenue 
of E1,254m was 0.8pc ahead of our forecast as yield growth in Q2 was 6.6pc versus our estimate of 5.7pc. Ancillary 
revenue came in at E298m, up 25pc yoy and beating our estimate by 7.5pc thanks to a strong performance from 
reserved seating.
On the cost line, the fuel bill, at E581m, came in E19m (3pc) below our estimate of E600m. Elsewhere, depreciation 
was some 11pc below our estimate, while marketing and distribution costs were 13pc higher than forecast. Total 
costs of E1,242m were 1.4pc better than we had forecast and consequently, PAT of E497m was 10.5pc above our 
estimate of E450m. Arguably of greatest interest in these results is the H2 yield guidance. Management has guided 
for 4pc yield growth for the full year to March 13, which implies yield growth of c.2pc in the winter quarters. It has 
still cautioned on the outlook for Q4 given its lack of visibility, but we suspect Q3 is shaping up reasonably well at 
this point. It has also raised full year profit guidance to a range of E490m to E520m. Taking the Q2 result and 
management guidance, we expect FY13 PAT in the region of E510m, an upgrade of c.8pc. This is a very 
impressive set of results from Ryanair and given the outlook from management, we expect the stock to perform 
very well today. Looking forward we continue to like the stock in terms of valuation and cash generation. We expect 
the dividend at the end of November to underpin the share price and with a sizeable upgrade from the Q2 results 
ISEQ ahead as Ryanair surprises ISEQ rises
we expect Ryanair to outperform near term and recover some of the relative underperformance versus easyJet. 
Retain BUY according to Goodbody Stockbrokers.

Highlight: Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, raised its full-year profit forecast after higher fares, a lower 
than expected fuel bill and a surge in demand after the Olympic Games helped it to beat first-half expectations.
Body
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, raised its full-year profit forecast after higher fares, a lower than expected 
fuel bill and a surge in demand after the Olympic Games helped it to beat first-half expectations.
The Irish airline, which is waiting to hear whether EU regulators will approve its takeover of domestic peer Aer 
Lingus, said today it was also benefiting from the collapse of European rivals like Spanair and Hungary's Malev.
Many airlines have been hit hard by Europe's struggling economy and high fuel costs. Ryanair has fared better than 
most, thanks to its size and focus on low costs and low prices.
"It was a strong performance after the Olympic Games, we certainly saw an upward rise in average fares. Many 
people who appeared to stay at home ... came back in force post the Olympic Games," Chief Financial Officer 
Howard Millar told Reuters. Ryanair said its fares rose 6 percent in the six months ended September, while 
passenger numbers surged 7 percent. As a result, it lifted its profit forecast for the year ending March 2013 to 490-
520 million euros from its previous guidance of 400-440 million euros. "A very impressive set of results ... with a 
sizeable upgrade from the Q2 results. We expect Ryanair to outperform near term and recover some of the relative 
underperformance versus easyJet," said Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst Donal O'Neill, referring to Ryanair's 
British arch rival. At 0845 GMT, Ryanair shares were up 7.3 percent at 4.884 euros, the biggest rise by a European 
blue-chip stock. Shares in European airlines Air France-KLM and Lufthansa both rose towards the end of last week 
after posting reassuring results on Thursday. Ryanair said its first-half net profit rose to 596 million euros from 544 
million a year ago and ahead of analyst expectations at 564 million. Revenue jumped 15 percent to 3.1 billion 
euros. The airline, with an average fare of 53 euros, said it was cautious on winter trading due to low visibility on 
fourth-quarter bookings, but expected the positive trends in the first half to continue, with good forward bookings 
into the third quarter. "We expect fares will rise for the full-year by about 4 percent ... about 1 percent higher than 
we expected, and our fuel bill will be down a bit more than we had previously guided," said Millar. Chief Executive 
Ryanair lifts full year profits forecast Ryanair Profits
Michael O'Leary told Reuters Insider TV that Spanish and Italian taxes had contributed to higher fares. Ryanair's 
fuel bill was lower than expected due to a fuel saving programme which manages the way pilots fly aircraft and 
where they buy fuel, said Millar. The airline now expects its fuel bill to rise 260 million euros this financial year, 40 
million euros less than previously assumed, he added. Ryanair has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators in 
an effort to secure regulatory clearance for its proposed 700 million euro takeover of Aer Lingus. The remedies 
include "at least two up-front buyer(s)" for routes that could be sold to ease competition fears, O'Leary said in a 
separate statement today. Ryanair, which carried 48 million passengers in the first half, said it was on target to grow 
its full-year traffic by 4 percent. Over the next decade, it aims to grab an 18 percent share of the European short-
haul air travel market from its current 12 percent.

presidential election in the U.S. on Tuesday and the 18th National Congress of China's ruling Communist Party 
scheduled for Thursday.
Additionally, the Greek parliament is expected to vote on another round of austerity measures this week ahead of 
receiving aid.
Confidence among Eurozone investors increased for a third month in a row in November, reflecting an improvement 
in their assessment of the current situation as well as expectations of future economic developments, data released 
by the think-tank Sentix showed.

(RTTNews) - Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported 23 percent increase in 
second-quarter profit, mainly due to a 7 percent rise in average fares and strong ancillary revenues, offset by 21 
percent higher fuel costs. Ryanair also lifted its full-year guidance. The shares are up about 8 percent in London.
The company noted that fuel costs, which represent 47 percent of total operating costs, increased to 581.2 million 
euros. Unit costs rose 6 percent, while excluding fuel, unit costs increased 2 percent from last year.
Looking ahead, the company expects market conditions in Europe to remain tough as recession, austerity, high fuel 
costs, and excessive Government taxes dampen air travel demand.
Ryanair sees its second-half traffic to be broadly flat as it ground up to 80 aircraft to limit impact of high oil prices as 
well as seasonally weaker demand and yields. Meanwhile, it targets to grow traffic by 4 percent to over 79 million 
passengers in fiscal 2013.
In the second quarter, Ryanair's profit before tax increased to 566.8 million euros from 463 million euros in the 
previous year. On a per share basis, earnings were 34.36 euro cents, higher than 27.31 euro cents per share a 
year earlier.
Total operating revenues grew 17 percent to 1.82 billion euros, mainly due to a 7 percent increase in average fares, 
and an 8 percent rise in passenger numbers. Total revenue per passenger rose 8 percent.
Operating margin increased by 1 point to 32 percent.
For the first half ended September 30, the company posted profit before tax of 679.3 million euros, higher than 
619.6 million euros in the previous year. On a per share basis, earnings increased to 41.20 euro cents per share 
from 36.56 euro cents per share in the prior year.
Revenues for the period grew 15 percent to 3.11 billion euros. Traffic improved 7 percent to 48 million passengers.
Ryanair has raised its full-year profit guidance to be in a range of 490 million euros to 520 million euros from its 
previous range of 400 million euros to 440 million euros.
In addition, the company has approved a second special dividend of 0.34 euros per share, which will be paid to 
shareholders on November 30.

Separately, updating Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L) offer Ryanair said it is determined to explore all commercial 
options to address any competition concerns the EU may have in order to secure approval for its proposed merger. 
As part of the EU's Phase 2 review, which began on August 29, it has submitted an unprecedented remedies 
package. As per the package, multiple up-front buyers will commit to open new bases in Ireland, and enter all of the 
Ryanair/Aer Lingus crossover routes which are not currently served by other substantial airline competitors.
In August end, Ryanair had announced its intention to re-bid for Aer Lingus if the European Commission clears its 
offer following its Phase II review.
As part of a third effort to create a single Irish airline group, Ryanair made an all-cash offer of 1.30 euros per share, 
valuing about 694 million euros or $879 million for rival Aer Lingus, in June 2012. Ryanair had first tried to acquire 
Aer Lingus in late 2006, but that bid was blocked by the European Commission on antitrust grounds.
In London, Ryanair shares are currently trading at 4.88 pence, up 0.34 pence or 7.43 percent, on a volume of 3.3 
million shares.

THE biggest question for UK investors this week is whether the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC) will opt for more quantitative easing.
The decision, which will be announced on Thursday, comes after strong jobs and GDP data.
"Strong third quarter GDP data suggested that underlying growth was slightly stronger than previously thought and 
the MPC''s debate is starting to pay more attention to the inflationary consequences of the strong labour market. As 
such, we expect the MPC to bide its time and announce no further easing measures at the November meeting," 
said Nomura's Philip Rush.
A busy reporting week starts today with figures from HSBC, Ryanair, Hiscox, Weir Group and Inmarsat.
Tomorrow brings updates from G4S, InterContinental Hotels Groups, Marks and Spencer, Associated British 
Foods, Babcock International Group, and Mears Group.
On Wednesday Burberry, Vedanta Resources, Aer Lingus, Old Mutual and Randgold Resources will all update the 
market while Thursday will bring news from, among others, Aviva, Bumi, Cable & Wireless Communications, Dairy 
Crest, Experian, Flybe Group, JD Wetherspoon, Land Securities, Tate & Lyle, Supergroup, Trinity Mirror and 3i 
Infrastructure.
Also of note on Thursday is the European Central Bank interest rate decision and Eurogroup meeting on Greece.
Friday brings reports from Beazley, Hornby, Hammerson, Rentokil, Rolls Royce and Tullett Prebon.

 As a recruitment company, Adecco 's fortunes tend to mirror fluctuations in the global economy. So it was in the 
second quarter, when the company enjoyed good growth in emerging markets but suffered declines in Europe, 
writesJames Shotter .
That trend is likely to remain in place when the group reports its third-quarter results. Against this backdrop, 
investors will be keen for an update on how the group's French restructuring - designed to save EUR45m - is going. 
France is Adecco's biggest market, providing 30 per cent of overall revenues in 2011, but sales have been declining 
sharply, down 13 per cent year on year in the second quarter.
With eurozone hiring sluggish at best, cost discipline is clearly important for Adecco. However, shareholders will 
also be interested to see if the boost to margins caused by professional hiring outstripping blue-collar work has 
been maintained.
In the third quarter last year, Adecco made net profits of EUR145m on revenues of EUR5.3bn. This time analysts 
are expecting net profit of EUR108m from revenues of EUR5.3bn.   InterContinental Hotels Group , which owns 
the Holiday Inn brand, is due to issue third-quarter results, with analysts' expecting $164m in earnings before 
interest and tax, up from $153m the year before, equating to 36 cents in earnings per share, writesChristopher 
Thompson.
That is driven by revenue per available room growth of 4.6 per cent in the US market - although business-related 
occupancy for the quarter overall was adversely affected by the Yom Kippur holiday falling in the middle of the week 
in September.
Corporate Diary
Investors will be hoping for an update of IHG's plans to sell the landmark Barclay hotel in New York, with analysts 
expecting it to fetch about $340m, and perhaps the beginning of a sale process for the InterContinental London 
Park Lane in 2013. Analysts at Panmure forecast that Richard Solomons, IHG's chief executive, will commence a 
$500m share buy-back programme.   Marks and Spencer is forecast to report an 11 per cent fall in interim pre-tax 
profit, writes Andrea Felsted . The consensus of analysts' expectations is for underlying pre-tax profit in the six 
months to the end of September to fall from £315.2m to £280m.
The UK high street bellwether is also expected to say that sales of clothing and homewares from stores open at 
least a year fell by 2.5 per cent, while like-for-like food sales rose 1.5 per cent, according to the consensus of 
analysts' forecasts.
The clothing performance would be an improvement on the first quarter when like-for-like general merchandise 
sales fell by 6.8 per cent, the weakest for three years. Although the so-called summer of events, including the 
London Olympics, was disappointing for M&S, sales improved in September as the high street was lifted by colder 
weather, in contrast to a year ago, when conditions were unseasonably warm.

  Deutsche Telekom is expected to reveal a further deterioration in US earnings in the third quarter before a 
progress report on the planned merger in the country with its rival MetroPCS, writesDan Thomas.
Contract subscriber numbers in the US are expected to have shown only weak growth ahead of the introduction of 
the iPhone 5. The weaker US earnings are expected to weigh on overall numbers at group level, with reported 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation expected to be down by about 4 per cent at EUR4.7bn.
The group is expected to repeat ebitda guidance of EUR18bn for 2012, even though European ebitda is expected 
to fall as much as 9 per cent in the quarter. The consensus forecast for free cash flow is about EUR1.7bn. Group 
revenues are expected to decline 1.1 per cent to EUR14.5bn. Domestic revenues are expected to improve, 
although still down by about 2 per cent, and any positive move is likely to be offset by weaker margins.
Analysts at Berenberg said the German market should be boosted by about 300,000 contract net additions and 
50,000 broadband net additions, but a 250,000 loss of fixed-network lines.

 When Hornby reports its interim results, investors will be hoping that the UK model train maker does not repeat the 
dismal news that has dogged it throughout 2012, writes Mark Wembridge .
The owner of the Scalextric, Airfix and Corgi brands has issued three profit warnings this year, the latest of which 
took more than a third from its share price in a day.
Hornby - which makes train sets that sell for as much as £275 - failed to get the sales boost expected from the 
Olympics, as consumers shunned models of black taxis and red buses.
Kent-based Hornby had forecast that the Olympics would provide a £7m boost to full-year revenues and add £2m to 
pre-tax profit, but that sentiment was reversed in September after the group was forced into heavy discounts to sell 
excess stock.
Investors will also want to be updated on its supply chain, which has faced severe disruptions after a supplier 
closed several factories in China.

(RTTNews) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) posted 10% higher profit after tax of 596 million 
euros for the first half, compared with 544 million euros last year. Earnings per ordinary share were 41.20 euro 
cents, an increase from 36.56 euro cents in the prior-year period.
Revenue grew 15% to 3.11 billion euros, from 2.71 billion euros a year earlier, with traffic up 7% to 48 million 
passengers, while ave. fares rose 6%. Unit costs went up 8%, mainly due to a 24% increase in fuel. Excluding fuel 
adjusted unit costs improved 2%.
The company said in a statement, "We are on target to grow traffic in FY13 by 4% to over 79m passengers. H2 
traffic will be broadly flat as we ground up to 80 aircraft to limit the impact of high oil prices, high airport fees at 
Stansted and Dublin, and seasonally weaker demand and yields upon the business."
Additionally, Ryanair has raised its full-year profit guidance to 490 million euros - 520 million euros, from its 
previous range of 400 million euros - 440 million euros.

Highlight: Flybe CFO states low cost carrier will not purchase potential Aer Lingus slots.
Body
In its latest bid for its rival low cost carrier Ryanair has offered to sell 20 of the 24 slots Aer Lingus has at Heathrow 
to satisfy EU competition laws.
This month Ryanair signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with British Airways parent company IAG 
to acquire 85% of the slots. The bid "" one of several by Ryanair - still requires approval from the European 
Commission.
Earlier in the summer Ryanair courted six airlines - Air France-KLM, easyJet, Etihad Airways, Virgin Atlantic, 
International Airlines Group and Flybe - over the slots.
Speaking to Airfinance Journal Andrew Knuckey Flybe's CFO states: "The Heathrow slots are not our bag. We do 
not fly into Heathrow, and it is not part of our plans going forward as it doesn't fit our regional model. We wouldn't be 
interested in the Heathrow slots that Ryanair are proposing to divest, should they get their hands on Aer Lingus. "
He adds: "BA/IAG have good strength at Heathrow now and, you have to say, not before time given the strength of 
the likes of Air France at Charles de Gaulle, KLM at Schiphol airport and Lufthansa at Frankfurt. It has levelled up 
the playing field for BA from where we sit. Other airlines are looking at Heathrow a little more sceptically than they 
were when the likes of Lufthansa were buying BMI, a few years back."
In July Ryanair submitted a $854 million bid for Aer Lingus, which the flag carrier rejected.

Highlight: Latin carrier gambles that interest rates will stay low as it refinances three 767-300ERs.
Body
JP Morgan has priced a new 12-year $212.355 million bond for Latin carrier Latam to refinance the deliveries of 
three 767-300ERs.
The bond, for Latam's Chilean arm (formerly known as Lan), is the first floating rate USD bond which will have full 
US Ex-Im guarantee.
The deal is priced at Libor +33 basis points and refinances three aircraft which delivered last year, solely funded by 
JP Morgan through three separate loans - all backed by US Ex-Im.
Ryanair is the only other airline to have signed a floating rate Ex-Im-backed bond issue. The carrier closed a Eu156 
million ($222 million) floating bond last year to partly refinance eight Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Credit Agricole-CIB 
(CA-CIB) and Goldman Sachs were bookrunners on that deal which priced at Euribor +70bps.
Latam's deal is a gamble by the Latin carrier that interest rates will stay low long enough for it to repay a substantial 
portion of the loan to mitigate any later interest rate rises.
Three month Libor presently stands at 0.31%, which combined with the initial pricing of 0.33% on the loan means 
Latam will be paying approximately 0.64% - considerably cheaper than the 1.5% coupon rates carriers have 
secured recently on US Ex-Im backed bonds.
As one capital market specialist comments: "If you look at any US Ex -Im guarantee,the initial years are where you 
have the most amount of principle outstanding "" so if you can minimise the coupon in the initial years then over the 
life of the deal then you, might, end up with a cheaper deal."
Law firm Vedder Price is advising US Ex-Im on the deal, Millbank is advising JP Morgan while Clifford Chance is 
offering legal counsel to Latam.
Latam's recent fixed rate deals
It has been a busy month for the Latin carrier which has issued three separate bonds so far this month.
On November 5 2012 Latam issued two bond issues through different vehicles to refinance different aircraft 
deliveries. Both deal were arranged by JP Morgan and enjoyed cover from US Ex-Im.
Deal analysis: Latam prices floating rate Ex-Im bond
The carrier issued a $144.7 million bond to refinance one Boeing 777-F delivered a couple of days before the bond 
issue which refinanced a JP Morgan loan. The bond has a coupon rate of 1.58% with midswaps at 50bps. The deal 
was three times oversubscribed, according to sources.
Latam also issued a $208.84 million bond to help finance the delivery of three 767-300ERs. The bond refinances a 
loan for two of the aircraft that have already delivered and will pre-fund a separate aircraft set to deliver before the 
end of November. The bond also has a coupon rate of 1.58%.
Citi and Santander have teamed to arrange a $286.4 million bond issue for Latam's Brazilian arm (formerly known 
as Tam). US Ex-Im is backing the deal which was priced at Libor plus 1.59% The deal has a weighted average life 
of 6.1 years with midswaps at 48 basis points. The deal prefunded one 777-300 that delivered on November 20 
2012 as well as refinancing another 777-300ER.
Millbank, Vedder Price and Clifford Chance were the legal advisers on the Citi and Santander deal.

The Irish government has announced its opposition to Ryanair's bid for Aer Lingus.
Leo Varadkar, Ireland's transport minister, on Tuesday told journalists:
"The Ryanair offer and at least the remedies that are being reported are not sufficient in our view, so we won't 
support their bid and, in addition, won't co-operate with their remedies package.The Commission will make its own 
decision, but we have given our views and they are around connectivity, competition and employment. We don't 
see any advantages for Ireland in what's being proposed and we see very significant potential risks."
The final decision is in the hands of the European Commission (EC), with an announcement expected early next 
year.
Ryanair launched a Eu694 million ($914 million) takeover bid for rival Aer Lingus in June 2012.
Speaking to Airfinance Journal Andrew Knuckey Flybe's CFO said yesterday that Flybe will not purchase potential

SAS is seeking to cut costs by SKr3bn ($452m) and sell a similar amount of assets as the lossmaking Scandinavian 
airline tries to avoid tapping sceptical investors including the region's governments for money.
Rumours have swirled around the company for weeks as an imminent pension accounting change has fuelled 
worries about its profitability and balance sheet, already heavily weakened by low-cost competitors such as Ryanair 
and Norwegian Air Shuttle .
SAS, which is half owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, responded yesterday by pre-
announcing its third-quarter results, which show a pre-tax profit of SKr568m.
It said it was finalising "a comprehensive plan to fundamentally address its costs on a long-term basis", with some 
local news reports suggesting pay cuts of up to 25 per cent could be included. The SKr3bn boost to pre-tax profits 
from the plan would help offset any writedown because of the accounting change - last estimated at about SKr11bn 
by the airline, which would all but wipe out its equity.
The Stockholm-based airline has struggled with a bloated cost base against low-cost rivals. SAS said it wanted to 
sell SKr3bn of non-core assets to try to reduce what it called its "long-term dependency on third-party funding".

The ISEQ rose steadily this morning as hopes that Ireland can get a deal on legacy bank debt rose following the 
visit here of Germany's finance minister.
By 12:30, the index was up 28.75 points to 3,255.98.
The work of securing Ireland's future fiscal sustainability continued yesterday, as Minister for Finance, Michael 
Noonan, and Minister for Public Expenditure, Brendan Howlin, met in Dublin with their German counterpart, 
Wolfgang Schauble. A 40-minute meeting was followed by press questions in which Schauble declared himself 
"100 per cent" confident that Ireland would not require a second bailout. The matter of Ireland's bank legacy debt 
brought a more nuanced response with the German finance minister referring back to the "special case" statement 
a week ago by Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Chancellor Angela Merkel as the German position, rather than reiterate 
his own comments in recent times ruling out any retrospective recapitalisations by the ESM. Both Schauble and 
Noonan did agree that any action on Ireland's bank debt will have to wait until mid-2013 when the pan-European 
bank regulation infrastructure will be in place. A quite vague communique followed the meeting with very little detail 
except an outline of the topics discussed, but it does now appear that Schauble has softened his stance towards 
bank recapitalisations somewhat.
Ryanair will report Q2 results on November 5th. Q2, the July-September summer period, is the key quarter for 
profitability in the year for Ryanair. Davy assumes net income of E443.7m, c.10pc ahead of last year, on revenues 
of E1,733.3m (+11.3pc year-on-year). This implies a profit of E542.5m for H1 (consensus: E564m) with Ryanair 
producing a similar H1 profit to last year, making up the entire Q1 shortfall. The key variable is yields. "We assume 
yields of 4.5pc (company guidance: 4-7pc). In our model, yields at the top end (+7pc) would imply net income of 
E475m in Q2. Other components of the Q2 forecasts are an increase in fuel costs (we assume another E100m or 
13pc unit fuel growth), ex-fuel costs up 0.9pc and ancillary growth per passenger of 1pc. Traffic growth in the 
ISEQ lifted by bank debt deal hopes ISEQ Rises
quarter has been 8.5pc, with loads of 86.7pc, down 1 percentage point. Commentary from peers, including easyJet 
and even the tour operators, points to strong late bookings and would imply strong late summer sales," said 
analyst, Stephen Furlong. Shares in the airline rose 2c to E4.50.

The ISEQ rose steadily this morning as hopes that Ireland can get a deal on legacy bank debt rose following the 
visit here of Germany's finance minister.
By 12:30, the index was up 28.75 points to 3,255.98.
The work of securing Ireland's future fiscal sustainability continued yesterday, as Minister for Finance, Michael 
Noonan, and Minister for Public Expenditure, Brendan Howlin, met in Dublin with their German counterpart, 
Wolfgang Schauble. A 40-minute meeting was followed by press questions in which Schauble declared himself 
"100 per cent" confident that Ireland would not require a second bailout. The matter of Ireland's bank legacy debt 
brought a more nuanced response with the German finance minister referring back to the "special case" statement 
a week ago by Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Chancellor Angela Merkel as the German position, rather than reiterate 
his own comments in recent times ruling out any retrospective recapitalisations by the ESM. Both Schauble and 
Noonan did agree that any action on Ireland's bank debt will have to wait until mid-2013 when the pan-European 
bank regulation infrastructure will be in place. A quite vague communique followed the meeting with very little detail 
except an outline of the topics discussed, but it does now appear that Schauble has softened his stance towards 
bank recapitalisations somewhat.

A Monarch Airlines Airbus A321 (G-OZBS) and a ­Ryanair Boeing 737-800 (EI-DPT) came within 360m (1,180ft) of 
a collision on a runway at Dublin airport, an Irish Air Accident Investigation Unit final report on the 21 May 2011 
incident states.
While the Vilnius-bound Ryanair 737 was carrying out a cleared take-off on runway 16 at Dublin, the late-running 
Monarch A321, operating as flight MON7562 to Tenerife, "mistakenly taxied on to the latter part of the same 
runway" as it moved towards the longer runway 28, says the AAIU.
The 737-800 had almost reached take-off decision speed (V1), but "it immediately conducted a high-speed rejected 
take-off and stopped approximately 360m from the A321".
There was no damage or injury during the rapid deceleration from a maximum recorded ground speed of 118kt 
(220km/h), with an indicated air speed of 134kt, says the report.
The flightcrew of the Monarch jet blamed poor taxiway markings and confusion over their location for the runway 
incursion, says the report. In addition a "period of high workload" generated by a late departure may have 
contributed to the incident, it says.
The AAIU notes that Dublin airport has put into operation a level 2 advanced surface movement guidance and 
control system, as a planned upgrade to its air traffic management on the ground, plus a number of other safety 
measures.

US group TPG enters the race for Stansted TRAVEL & LEISURE

Highlight: Macquarie among rival bidders
Body
TPG, the US private equity group created out of the buyout of Continental Airlines 20 years ago, has emerged as a 
bidder for Stansted, London's third-biggest airport.
The US company has submitted a first-round offer for the £1bn asset and is understood to be up against investors 
including Macquarie, the Australian investment bank, and a partnership between Manchester Airports Group (MAG) 
and Melbourne-based Industry Funds Management.
Stansted was put on the block this summer after BAA, its owner, lost a final attempt to overturn a 2009 Competition 
Commission ruling ordering it to dispose of three airports, including Essex-based Stansted.
While several people close to the talks believe MAG stands the best chance of winning Stansted, TPG would bring 
experience in the aviation sector - as well as a co-founder, David Bonderman, who chairs the board of Ryanair, 
which is Stansted's biggest customer.
Ryanair has blamed BAA's user fees for falling traffic at Stansted, and aviation experts agree that a new owner 
would need to work closely with the airline to bring passenger numbers back to 2007 levels, when the airport 
processed 24m travellers annually, compared with 18m last year.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, had spoken to several potential bidders this year about taking a stake in 
the airport . But he said last month that BAA, which now calls itself Heathrow after its biggest airport, ruled out any 
sale to a consortium that included Ryanair.
Stansted is one of three airports in the UK where take-off and landing charges are determined by regulators, 
producing steady returns for its owner. The auction drew initial interest from a half-dozen investors around the world 
but only three are understood to have made formal bids.
US group TPG enters the race for Stansted TRAVEL & LEISURE
BAA and its controlling stakeholder, Ferrovial, are expected to give bidders further details of the contest this week, 
including setting a deadline for second-round offers. To make the shortlist, bidders will need to prove they have the 
operating experience necessary to run the airport.
TPG has remained active in aviation since Mr Bonderman bought Continental out of bankruptcy in 1993 and 
created Texas Pacific Group a few months later. Just this spring, it held talks with US Airways about a joint bid for 
American Airlines, which filed for Chapter 11 late last year.

'Michael O'Leary goes to Moscow.' As phrases go, it has an undeniable ring to it.
Reports last week that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs had been in touch with Russian officials 
about getting clearance for Ryanair flights to Moscow set tongues wagging across the airline industry. The 
discussions may be at an early stage, but they suggest some intentions in this direction by the Irish airline.
The photo opportunity for O'Leary to wear a fur hat, or whatever else, in itself might be worth the effort. But a 
possible move towards Russian flights throws up all kinds of questions about Ryanair's intentions for that market in 
the longer term.
The airline already flies to multiple eastern European destinations, but all of them are in the EU. Russia is a huge 
international aviation market which is also growing. The split between domestic Russian airline passengers and 
international travel is nearly 50-50, and both segments of the market are performing well.
The Russians are welcoming foreign low-cost airlines to fly into the country, although flying within it might be a 
different story.
The Russian first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, recently welcomed the expansion of foreign budget airlines. 
"We are talking about allowing low-cost airlines to fly to some destinations where their technology, investment and 
experience of managing this business could increase competition and, of course, lower costs," a Russian 
newspaper reported his spokesman as saying.
Low-cost airlines flying to Russia at present include Germany's Air Berlin and Germanwings, Spain's Vueling 
Airlines, Norway's Norwegian, Austria's Niki, Turkey's Pegasus Airlines and the UAE-based companies Air Arabia 
and Flydubai.
To Russia with lucre?
The domestic market has been much more fraught, but it is a market of 25 million passengers a year in its own 
right. The only domestic low-cost airlines operating in Russia were SkyExpress, founded in 2006, and Avianova, 
which began flying in 2009. Both ceased operations in 2011.
Domestic and international passenger numbers increased by 7.8 per cent to 5.3 million year-on-year in October 
2011, and 12.3 per cent to 54.7 million overall for the ten months ended October 2011, so there is plenty of growth 
there.
Increasingly large numbers of Russian middle-class travellers want to fly to sunny destinations in western Europe, 
such as Spain, as well as closer to home, such as Turkey. Russian airlines are benefiting from these growing 
passenger numbers, but their balance sheets are not always the strongest.
Aeroflot is the dominant carrier in Russia internationally and domestically. The others have either a domestic or an 
international focus. Transaero is very strong in the international sector and is second behind Aeroflot, but falls to 
fifth place on the domestic ranking.
Lufthansa is the only western carrier to rank in the top nine airlines for international capacity into Russia, with just 
under 40,000 seats available, based on figures for last December. This placed it in fourth position, between 
Russia's S7 Airlines and Rossiya at number five.
The biggest destination for Russian travellers by a long way is western Europe, followed by eastern and central 
Europe and then central Asia.
If O'Leary is seriously thinking of using Dublin-Moscow as a starting point for other international routes out of 
Russia, his timing is particularly good. Russian airlines are facing serious financial challenges due to skyrocketing 
expenses, according to a report by the Association of Air Transportation Operators earlier this year.
Russian airlines may have turned a 4 billion rouble (EUR 100 million) profit in 2010, but they collectively lost a total 
of 14.5 billion roubles (EUR 356 million) in 2011, as fuel prices rose by 30 per cent. They also have major tax 
pressures to deal with.
One small issue for Ryanair is the fact that it makes very good margins by charging passengers higher prices when 
they want to fly at short notice. This is part of its very successful business model. However, visas are required for 
visits to Russia, so customers would need to book well in advance.
According to aviation sources, Ryanair's model is well capable of making a good profit margin on the lower fares 
that it offers for those who book well in advance.
"Take places like Scandinavia -- passengers there tend to book well in advance. The Germans are the same, and 
Ryanair does great profitable business there. It's only in places like Ireland and Britain that you will find people 
running around booking at the last minute and paying more for it," said one source.
But industry sources warned about jumping to conclusions about Ryanair's possible intentions in Russia. It is a 
potentially lucrative international destination, but airport charges are still a big factor.
Not used to dealing with the Ryanairs of this world, several major airports would be much more expensive than 
anything Ryanair would require. "I think airports there have no idea how much costs would have to come down," 
said one source.
Even if Ryanair were to develop a business in Russia, possibly with a longer-term aim of tackling its domestic 
market, enormous obstacles stand in the way. The domestic Russian market is fraught with difficulties. There are 
complicated rules about crewing, regulation, charges and taxes.
"Any airline operating in Russia would come under enormous pressure to use Russian-manufactured equipment 
and planes," said one airline source. "Any foreign airline would need licences to use non-Russian aircraft and other 
To Russia with lucre?
equipment. Their gear is just not rated, and would be a major obstacle to an international low-cost airline looking at 
the domestic market."
O'Leary may be pondering whether to dip a toe in the water via flights from Dublin to Moscow. But industry sources 
question whether he is seriously eyeing a major assault on the Russian market.
"There are other markets that Ryanair could potentially do well in much more quickly," said one source, citing 
Turkey and the potential for expansion around that region.
There are also mature European markets where Ryanair could still expand its business very effectively. A big 
opportunity exists for the airline in Germany, for example, if it can capitalise on some of the weaknesses showing 
up in Air Berlin.
Ryanair already does very good business in Germany, and could use that to grow there. France has been 
mentioned as another familiar market close to home, where Ryanair could increase its share.
Back in 2010, a blogger spotted a Ryanair plane at a Moscow airport. Knowing the airline didn't fly there, he 
wondered what it was all about. Another blogger told him the Irish airline had probably just rented the plane to 
someone else for a few days or weeks.
The first guy then suggested that perhaps O'Leary was going to fly to Moscow and start calling it Helsinki South. It 
may happen yet.

Private equity firm targets Treasury debt

TPG Capital, the private equity firm run by Ryanair chairman David Bonderman, has started buying up debt held by 
Treasury Holdings, the insolvent Irish property giant, with a view to potentially gaining control of some of the firm's 
assets.
The US firm has been acquiring debt linked to the EUR 375 million Opera CMH portfolio, which includes a string of 
Irish assets, such as Stillorgan Shopping Centre and Bank of Ireland's headquarters on Mespil Road.
The debt behind the portfolio is listed on the stock market, allowing TPC to buy into the portfolio.
A number of other opportunity funds have also invested in the debt.
The EUR 375 million was borrowed by Real Estates Opportunities (REO), the investment vehicle backed by 
Treasury Holdings. The assets were put up as security for the loans, which are due to mature next year.
The German bank Eurohypo organised the bond, which was snapped up by various investors.
With liquidators now appointed to vast chunks of Treasury Holdings, a number of funds believe they may be able to 
get control of the assets by buying into debt.
The portfolio behind the bond was once valued at EUR 575 million, but is now worth in the region of EUR 290 
million.
Any prospective deal is complicated by the National Asset Management Agency (Nama), which is owed EUR 85 
million as part of the arrangement.
However Nama ranks behind the bondholders in terms of security. The agency has appointed Brookland Partners 
to advise on options over its exposure.
Private equity firm targets Treasury debt
The assets are outside the control of the court-appointed liquidators to Treasury as the money was raised through 
REO.
The portfolio is performing well, with close to full occupancy.
Johnny Ronan and Richard Barrett, Treasury's founders, are hoping to retain ownership of the Opera portfolio, and 
have begun refinancing talks with Eurohypo.
Investment bank Cairn is advising on the refinancing for bondholders.
In a statement, Cairn said that "legal, property and financial due diligence" had already been done to determine the 
options now available.

SIPTU has expressed its disappointment at the collapse last evening of talks at the Labour Relations Commission 
(LRC) aimed at resolving the pensions crisis at Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA).
Meanwhile, Ryanair offered to break any strike that may occur by offering fully crewed aircraft for Aer L:ingus 
passengers.
Industrial action looks increasingly likely at Aer Lingus after the breakdown of talks aimed at addressing a E750m 
deficit in the pension scheme.
According to SIPTU Organiser, Dermot O'Loughlin, union members and Congress representatives will meet on 
Tuesday to discuss their response to the latest breakdown of negotiations. "It is disappointing that there has been 
no progress in the discussions to resolve the crisis which threatens thousands of employees with financial ruin in 
their retirement years. The intransigence of Aer Lingus is particularly disturbing as the airline is responsible for its 
failure to properly fund the pension scheme over many years. At the same time, the company has made generous 
pension contributions for a small number of elite staff which are ten times greater than those made for employees at 
lower grades. Aer Lingus has cash reserves of E1 billion and could resolve this issue if it had the will to do so. 
Unlike the DAA, it has refused to engage in meaningful discussions at the Labour Court or LRC over recent weeks." 
Ryanair's Spokesman said today that he regards what he call "this latest attempt by Aer Lingus unions to bully the 
airline into making further unjustified" contributions to Aer Lingus' defined contribution pension schemes as 
"industrial blackmail". "These claims are totally unjustified coming from a group of unions which already received a 
gift of E104m into their pension schemes in 2006, on top of receiving 15pc of Aer Lingus' equity at the IPO and a 
further E35m gift from the airline in 2010 to pay off the ESOT's bank debts," he said.

The ISEQ dipped under the 3,200 mark again, falling in step with European and world markets as investors looked 
at the latest big earnings news and were disappointed with worries over Spain also resurfacing.
The index was down 45.12 points to 3,191.83.
Shares in drinks group, C and C, surged 23c to E4.00 in the morning but closed just 3c up at E3.80 after said it is to 
buy U.S. cider firm Vermont Hard Cider for dollar 305 million to tap into a fast-growing market and offset weakness 
in its core Irish and UK business, where sales of its flagship Bulmers/Magners brand slumped during a wet summer. 
First half results were in line with brokers' forecasts overall. H1 operating profit of E65.6m (-6pc constant currency) 
compared to the Davy forecast of E64m. Full year guidance was confirmed at the lower end of the guidance range 
of E112-118m (Davy FY: E112m). There was a weak GB and ROI cider performance with intense competition in UK 
cider and significant deflation in Ireland. Tennent's was very strong as was International (+33pc volume growth). 
"The H1 results will be overshadowed by the acquisition of the Vermont Cider Company. The US cider market is 
exhibiting very strong growth (80pc in September yoy). With this deal, C and C now has a strong infrastructure to 
capture growth in this nascent market. This deal will transform the geographical exposure of the business and will 
lift the growth rate of the group. C&C's rating is also likely to expand," said Davy's Barry Gallagher.
Elsewhere, shares in Dragon Oil rose 14c to E6.99 after it published an IMS for Q3. Gross production averaged 
69,600 b/d during the three-month period (+13pc yoy) and is currently producing over 70,000 b/d. Average price 
realisation was dollar 98 per barrel - an 11pc discount to Brent. Dragon also provided guidance that production 
growth in 2012 compared to 2011 was now likely to be closer to the bottom end of the 10-15pc range. Similarly, it 
indicated that 2013 production growth was likely to be at the bottom of the same range. Medium-term guidance at 
100,000 barrels per day is unchanged. Shares in CRH fell 31c to E13.55 and Kerry Group fell 1c to E40.30 while 
Ryanair dropped 10c to E4.42.

IRISH low-cost airline Ryanair has offered concessions to European Union antitrust regulators in a bid to secure 
regulatory clearance to acquire local rival Aer Lingus.
Ryanair, whose most recent bid for Aer Lingus in June valued the firm at (EURO)694m (£566m), hopes to convince 
the European Commission that a takeover would not restrict competition on routes out of Ireland.
The European Commission did not detail Ryanair's offer, which was submitted last Wednesday. The EU executive 
has set a 6 February deadline for its decision on the deal, having stood in the way of earlier advances from Ryanair.
Earlier this month, Ryanair said Europe's biggest budget airline would scrap some of both its and Aer Lingus's 
routes from Ireland, and may set up a Brussels base for Aer Lingus as part of a package of concessions.
He said British Airways, Citijet and Virgin Atlantic Airways, had expressed interest in taking over some of the routes.
Ryanair's bid has currently lapsed, but the firm has pledged to renew its advances if Europe gives its blessing.

Ryanair has offered concessions to European Union antitrust regulators in a bid to secure regulatory clearance to 
acquire rival Aer Lingus.
The European Commission did not detail Ryanair's offer which was submitted last Wednesday. The EU executive 
has set a Feb. 6 deadline for its decision on the 700 million euro deal.
EU regulators are worried the takeover could cut competition on routes out of Ireland, where the two airlines are 
each other's closest rivals.

Four organisations backing the Yes vote in the children's referendum in the referendum say that they are not using 
massive donations from private sources for campaigning purposes.
Up to EUR 450,000 of the Yes campaign's funding is reportedly coming from the non-governmental organisation 
Yes for Children, which is backed by four Irish children's charities.
The Standards in Public Office Commission says that campaigning groups may not accept donations of more than 
EUR 6,348.69 (IR£5,000) a year from any person, or any donation from an individual living outside Ireland, except 
an Irish citizen.
A spokesman for the commission said: "A donation breaches the rules if it is given for political purposes. Trying to 
influence a referendum is a political purpose, according to the Electoral Act 1997 as amended by the 2001 act."
Shane Kelly, the communications director of Yes for Children, said: "The campaign effort is fluid, but is estimated to 
cost somewhere in the region of EUR 350,000 to EUR 450,000. The amount spent will be somewhat dependent on 
how successful the fundraising campaign is and what other organisations are doing.
"Yes for Children is a combination of ISPCC, the Children's Rights Alliance, Barnardos and Campaign for Children. 
All four organisations are committed to running the most comprehensive campaign possible for a Yes vote."
A spokesman for Irish-American billionaire Chuck Feeney's Atlantic Philanthropies said it had given EUR 400,000 
to the Children's Rights Alliance (CRA) this year. Tanya Ward, chief executive of the CRA, said: "No money 
(including the grant monies) has been contributed to the Yes for Children campaign."
Campaign for Children, chaired by former Supreme Court judge Catherine McGuinness, is one of the projects of 
Stand Up for Children, which received EUR 1 million from Atlantic Philanthropies at the end of 2010.
Yes camp deny using donations for campaign
Campaign for Children also received EUR 700,000 from the One Foundation, set up by Ryanair heir Declan Ryan 
and Deirdre Mortell.
Campaign for Children failed to respond to queries, but its website says it is "currently engaged in a series of public 
education, advocacy and campaigning activities".
Mortell of the One Foundation said all the information about funding was on the organisation's website.
The site states that the One Foundation has given EUR 1,762,000 to the Children's Alliance and EUR 6.4 million to 
Barnardos in two tranches, but does not break down those figures. The Campaign for Children received EUR 
700,000.
Beyond that, we will not be making any comment," she said.
Spokeswomen for Barnardos and the ISPCC said the organisations were committing staff time and support to the 
Yes for Children campaign, but had not put funding into the campaign.
Meanwhile, a High Court challenge to the use of more than EUR 1 million of public money in the children's 
referendum will be heard on Tuesday.
Mark McCrystal has sued the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, claiming that the government has not been 
neutral in its information campaign for the referendum.
The referendum takes place on Saturday, November 10.

Aer Lingus industrial action could flare again

Talks to resolve the airport pension crisis remain stalled, with negotiators from Aer Lingus and its trade unions 
unable even to agree on the dates on which they are due to hold meetings, according to correspondence seen by 
this newspaper.
Siptu's pension committee is to meet tomorrow morning, and it is understood that a possible reactivation of 
industrial action at Aer Lingus is likely to be on the agenda, according to sources.
By contrast, significant progress was understood to have been made early last week between the trade unions and 
the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA), whose staff are also members of the troubled pension fund.
But the leak of a confidential memo subsequently brought talks with the DAA to a halt, with the company forced to 
deny that it made a EUR 55 million offer to unions to fix the problem. Those stalled talks are set to resume 
tomorrow.
The earlier DAA breakthrough is understood to have revolved around a new proposal from the union side called 
Bridge 300. This would see the two companies establish a separate fund alongside a proposed new defined 
contribution pension scheme.
Currently, Aer Lingus and DAA pensioners are entitled to receive the social welfare pension, worth EUR 11,975.60 
per annum, on top of their company pension, but this will end under the new scheme. The proposed Bridge 300 
fund would pay future pensioners the equivalent of 55 per cent of the social welfare pension, about EUR 6,600 per 
annum, regardless of final salary.
This would see lower-paid workers receive pensions of as much as 91 per cent of final salary, but that would fall to 
about 77 per cent for higher-paid workers.
"The most critical element for this to succeed is to get Aer Lingus into meaningful talks. If that does not happen, 
then staff have nowhere else to go but industrial action,  " said a trade union source.
Aer Lingus industrial action could flare again
"But Aer Lingus is looking over its shoulder at its shareholders, namely Ryanair, and it seems to have an attitude of 
'if we ignore this long enough, it will go away', despite what it is saying in press statements."  
For its part, Aer Lingus said that it remained committed to finding a long-term solution to the scheme's funding 
difficulties "that balances the provision of fair and sustainable pensions into the future with the interests of our 
shareholders".
But a series of letters between the parties last week suggest confusion and mistrust.
Aer Lingus denied that it had refused to meet trade union representatives, and said it was planning to attend the 
Labour Relations Commission (LRC) for talks last Thursday.
But Siptu wrote back to Aer Lingus to say it had no knowledge of any scheduled LRC hearing.
Union negotiators wrote a second time to Aer Lingus last Thursday to seek a direct meeting with Aer Lingus 
management to discuss the Bridge 300 proposal. Aer Lingus wrote back saying it "entirely rejects your version of 
events", repeating that it had agreed to a request to attend the LRC.
Siptu then wrote to LRC chief executive Kieran Mulvey, querying if such a meeting was to take place.
"Will the commission validate that there was no mention, to the union side, that conciliation would be reconvened 
on Thursday October 18 2012?"   said the email. It also asked Mulvey to confirm that "they (LRC) were unable to 
narrow the gap; in fact things were going backwards".
Mulvey responded to Siptu's main negotiator to say that "engagements throughout the conciliation process between 
the conciliators and the parties are confidential". He said that he was waiting for the parties to "revert back to the 
commission following local talks".
The leak of an internal Impact trade union memo to the Irish Times last Wednesday also caused problems, 
according to sources, who suggested that the leak was "designed to set back progress".
In reaction, the DAA released a statement that said attempts by unnamed sources to imply the company was not 
"fully aligned with Aer Lingus  " with regard to the outcome of the pensions negotiations was "a gross 
misrepresentation of the facts".
Although the leaked memo was originally emailed from an Impact official to officials in the same union, a 
spokesman from that union denied it was a strategic leak. But one source close to the talks speculated that the leak 
may have been linked to a EUR 170 million deficit in the entirely separate Aer Lingus pilots' pension fund that has 
yet to be dealt with.
"This is a massively complex issue involving a wide range of different elements and people.
"Some parties might be of the view that, if Aer Lingus spends its entire budget on solving the main pension 
problem, then it would have an impact on the company's ability to deal with shortfalls in other pensions," said the 
source.

Tuscan wine estates are not without their high-profile admirers. The musician Sting and Italian designer Roberto 
Cavalli are among those who own estates in the Chianti Classico region. Owners can enjoy the pleasure of drinking 
their own wine while owning an enviable property. It can also make a sound investment, especially if they buy an 
estate where money has already been put into wine production.
Gemma Bruce, Italy consultant to estate agent Aylesford , says: "The most desirable wine properties tend to be fully 
restored, high-end, accompanied by several hectares of highquality vines."
She is selling a six-bedroom manor house near Panzano, Chianti, in 10.9 hectares, 2.7 of which are vineyards, with 
permission granted to plant a further hectare. For sale at EUR5.5m, it also has a two-bedroom guest house, two 
studio apartments, wine cellar, tennis court and pool.
Nik Barnewitz of Casa in Toscana , part of Savills ' Italian network, has noticed another change in vineyard buyers. 
"We are seeing interest from investors from Russia, northern Europe, Singapore and Hong Kong," he says. Tuscan 
wine estates have been bought by overseas purchasers since the 1970s, which is good for the local economy 
because buyers spend money in the restaurants and shops as well as providing employment. For EUR4.5m, 
Barnewitz is selling a restored five-bedroom farmhouse near Gaiole, Chianti, on 82 hectares, five of which are 
planted with Chianti Classico vines.
The best areas for quality wines are around the towns in the Chianti Classico region, and around Montepulciano 
and Montalcino in Val d'Orcia, south of Siena. Chianti Classico is the more expensive region. "The Chianti Classico 
area has become so popular that prices are still going up every year," says Jeremy Onslow-Macaulay of Casa & 
Country Italian Property . "So people are travelling further and going south of Siena, where you can still find 
farmhouses to renovate and where values are around 20 per cent cheaper."
Val d'Orcia is better value because it is further from Florence and the nearest airport is Perugia, only serviced 
internationally by Ryanair flights from the UK.

"We have many clients who want to be able to drink their own wine to enjoy or give it to friends, but don't 
necessarily want to get involved in the actual production of it," says Onslow-Macaulay. They usually employ an 
oenologist to advise them and a wine manager and send the grapes to a co-operative for bottling. It is also possible 
to lease out the vines. Someone not wanting the trouble of owning land at all but still interested in having their own 
wine could buy one of the two remaining apartments at Castello San Donato in Gaiole. Here, they can own a part of 
the vineyard and have the wine bottled for them. Casa & Country is marketing the two and five-bedroom apartments 
for EUR490,000 and EUR2.2m respectively.
Some of the smaller estates have their own wine cellars to press, store and bottle the wine. One such estate, which 
is new to the market, is Il Moro, bought by Coca and Sebastiano Cameli in 2002. The property, near the village of 
San Giovanni d'Asso and the town of Montalcino, where Brunello wine is made, was a ruin at that time. It took a 
year to transform the farmhouse into a comfortable five-bedroom home, after which they planted two hectares with 
French vines, in order to produce a "super Tuscan" wine. A state-of-the-art wine cellar was built in 2006. The wine 
is now sold overseas and to local restaurants with around 7,000 bottles being produced a year. "We've taken it to 
where the wine is perfect, but there is room for a new owner to expand," says Coca Cameli, whose husband died 
last year. Il Moro is for sale at EUR8m through Aylesford .
Someone looking for a bigger project might be interested in a six-bedroom manor house near Panzano in Chianti 
with 13 hectares and wine cellar. Both the house, refurbished in the late 1970s, and cellar, which has been unused 
for five years, need modernisation. It is for sale for EUR3.75m through Casa & Country.
The market for wine estates is not as busy as it has been, so purchasers can negotiate on price. Most smaller wine 
estates are being sold by individuals who bought 20-25 years ago for the same reasons as people are buying now. 
"They are selling because their life has changed due to age, divorce or ill health," says Barnewitz. "They might well 
consider dropping the price by 15-25 per cent because they know they might not find another serious buyer in the 
near future."
Buying a wine estate is not something to be taken lightly. The land vines are grown on has to be a certain type and 
in the right location, the grapes have to be sent off regularly to be tested so that harvesting takes place at exactly 
the right time and then the wine has to be stored, aged and bottled correctly. "Owning a wine estate is for long-term 
investment and enjoyment, not to make an immediate profit from the sale of the wine," says Coca Cameli.

Highlight: Chief sets out bid to revitalise airport
Plans include better retail facilities
Body
Manchester Airports Group would return Stansted's traffic to 2007 levels within a decade if it were to win the contest 
this autumn to take over London's third biggest airport, according to the operator's chief executive.
Charlie Cornish said yesterday that his plans for Stansted included an improvement of the airport's retail offering 
and better relationships with its airline customers, including Ryanair, the dominant carrier at Stansted.
He also played down the prospect of the sort of big capital investments, such as a new train line into London, that 
would attract resistance from airlines, whose landing fees pay for such projects.
"Stansted's assets are, as we can see it outside in, in pretty good condition, but are there opportunities to improve 
the customer experience with a better retail experience? Probably," he said.
The group, which owns Manchester, East Midlands and Bournemouth airports, is partnering with Australian investor 
Industry Funds Management to bid for Stansted, which owner BAA finally agreed to sell this summer following a 
2009 Competition Commission order.
The partnership is borne out of lessons MAG learnt from its unsuccessful tilt at Gatwick three years ago.
"The key lesson was to get your equity investments ready and your financing in place," said Mr Cornish, who joined 
the company in 2010.
Under the terms of the deal, IFM will buy 35 per cent of MAG's equity and get half its voting rights if the pair win 
Stansted.
They are up against at least one other serious bidder - a consortium led by Australasian group Morrison & Co - with 
first-round offers due next week.
MAG pledge to lift Stansted traffic TRAVEL & LEISURE
Other interested parties include Macquarie and Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings vehicle.
Mr Cornish argued that operating expertise would be key to putting Stansted - whose traffic has fallen by a quarter 
in five years - back on a growth trajectory.
"You need to have the airport knowhow and the relationships with customers," he said, pointing out that his team - 
which includes a former Ryanair commercial director - already have experience wooing back a recalcitrant Ryanair 
chief executive Michael O'Leary, who quit Manchester airport in 2009 but has since returned.
Moreover, while Ryanair represents two-thirds of Stansted's customers, it would account for just a quarter of 
passengers served by an expanded MAG.
But Mr Cornish declined to endorse Mr O'Leary's view that the next runway built in London would be at Stansted. 
"We see Stansted being viable irrespective of the outcome of government deliberations [about airport capacity in 
the southeast]."
Nor would MAG seek, in the short to medium term, to make it anything other than a point-to-point, Europe and 
leisure-focused facility, even as the company seeks to bring more long-haul, business-friendly routes to Manchester 
airport.
MAG would also not seek to buy any of BAA's other airports should they come up for sale, Mr Cornish said. But he 
argued operators that own more than one airport do have an advantage over independent owners - a notion 
rejected by Colin Matthews, his equivalent at BAA, which this week said it would no longer use an umbrella 
company name and instead go by the brands of its individual airports.
"We're fairly certain that the costs we allocate into our smaller airports are lower than they would be under 
independent operators," Mr Cornish said.

British Airways owner IAG  was the laggard yesterday even as the FTSE 100 showed its biggest rally in a fortnight.
Deteriorating trading at Iberia will drag IAG into a loss this year and force a costly and complex restructuring, 
according to analysts at Liberum Securities. They forecast Iberia to lose about EUR400m this year.
Since merging with BA in January 2011, Iberia management has tried to improve earnings by moving domestic and 
European passengers on to its no-frills Iberia Express brand.
"This strategy has failed," said Liberum. It estimated that Iberia's short-haul business cost EUR73 per seat to 
operate, against a sale price of EUR64. The cost per seat was 25 per cent higher than easyJet and more than 
double Ryanair's, it said.
Liberum expected IAG to announce next month that it would cut much of Iberia's European network and rely more 
on low-cost partners Vueling and Air Nostrum. But any restructuring has to be drawn up around legal action by 
unions, meaning that Iberia was likely to remain a drag on group profits into 2014, it said.
The cost of restructuring would also weaken IAG's balance sheet at a time when it is embarking on an upgrade 
programme to replace its long-haul fleet, Liberum continued. It forecast gross debt this year to exceed IAG's self-
imposed limit of four times operating earnings.
"IAG is trading on a relatively high multiple, and we would argue an unsustainable premium to its direct peers," said 
Liberum, which saw the shares as 30 per cent overvalued. IAG closed 1.5 per cent lower at 155.6p.
Financial stocks led the wider market higher as the cost of insuring their debt eased for a fifth straight day. The 
FTSE 100 was up 1.1 per cent or 64.93 points at 5,870.54.
Lloyds Banking Group rose 6 per cent to 42.8p after reports that it had been given permission to swap assets with 
its Scottish Widows insurance business. Royal Bank of Scotland added 4.4 per cent to 280p and Barclays rose 
3.9 per cent to 246.1p.

Car insurer Admiral rose 5 per cent to £11.75 on the highest daily volume since June. The strength led traders to 
revive theories that private equity could be interested in buying Admiral's websites, or that the whole group may be 
attractive to a European insurer.
Paragon , the buy-to-let mortgage lender, gained 6.3 per cent to 237.1p after a Fitch report indicated strong 
demand for its latest sale of mortgage securities. Merrill Lynch upgraded Paragon to "buy".
Imagination Technologies led the mid-cap risers, up 7.9 per cent to 478.9p following reports that Texas Instruments, 
one of its key customers, sold its smartphone chip unit to Amazon rather than winding it down as previously 
announced.
Numis Securities added the stock to its "buy" list. "Should Amazon buy TI's mobile chip business, we would expect 
Imagination to become an important partner in its strategy of developing an integrated smartphone and tablet 
platform to rival Apple," it said.
Sector peer Arm Holdings rose 3.2 per cent to 596p. Morgan Stanley recommended Arm ahead of results next 
week, though it said the numbers and guidance would have to be much better than expected to gain a positive 
reaction.
Better than expected interim earnings and reassuring guidance lifted N Brown , the mail-order shopping group, by 
13.8 per cent to 306.9p.
Among the fallers, GKN  was down 3.4 per cent to 204.8p after warning of recent weaker trading.
Ophir Energy  lost 3.3 per cent to 579.5p, with Deutsche Bank downgrading the explorer to "sell" on valuation 
grounds. Ophir's 100 per cent success rate on exploration this year has driven a re-rating of the shares, but there 
are no further clear catalysts beyond a capital markets day next week, it said.
Sportingbet edged 0.9 per cent higher to 53.5p after William Hill and GVC provisionally agreed a 61.1p per share 
bid, 49.9p of which was in cash.
Tabcorp, the Australian bookmaker, and Paddy Power were both rumoured to be considering their options, though 
analysts were divided on the likelihood of a higher offer. "The problem for Sportingbet is that a good proportion of 
the shareholder base either was in there for the bid or also hold shares in William Hill. Therefore, while we do not 
see the bid as a knockout, the odds favour the bidders," said Peel Hunt.
William Hill climbed 4.9 per cent to 342p and GVC ended unchanged at 233.5p.

Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, is being investigated in Italy for allegedly dodging around 12 million euros 
of social security payments, a judicial source told Reuters today.
Prosecutors in the northern Italian city of Bergamo, where Ryanair-operated airport Orio al Serio is based, allege 
the Irish carrier avoided heavier taxation in Italy by paying lower pension fees in Ireland for staff flying in and out of 
Bergamo.
The source, with direct knowledge of the investigation, said Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary had been 
under investigation since June 2010 for his role as legal representative of the group.
The airline's Legal and Regulatory Affairs Director Juliusz Komorek was also being investigated on the same 
grounds, the source added, confirming an earlier report by the Corriere della Sera newspaper. The criminal case is 
part of a wider fiscal offensive led by Italian state pension fund INPS against Ryanair, which has often been 
criticised by domestic rivals for allegedly unfair competitive practices. INPS has started similar legal actions in 
several Italian cities where Ryanair operates, a legal source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Ryanair declined 
to comment on the specific case but said it respected EU fiscal regulations. "Ryanair does not comment on rumour 
or speculation and will continue to observe EU tax laws," Head of Communications Stephen McNamara said in an 
email to Reuters. INPS says Ryanair did not pay around 12 million euros, including fines, for social security taxes 
on its 220 employees based in Bergamo. The airline has appealed against the INPS claim and a civil court hearing 
over the case is scheduled in February 2013, the judicial source said. Ryanair says it followed EU regulations 
allowing budget airlines to apply the cheapest social security fees available, independent of where staff are based, 
the legal source said, adding that Ryanair's personnel work on Irish aircraft. New EU rules approved earlier this 
year state that pilots, stewards and hostesses will pay taxes where their "home base" is, or where they start and 
finish their service, the legal source said. However carriers will have 10 years to comply with these new rules, the

source added. Ryanair has a lower cost base than many of its competitors, which are struggling with high fuel 
costs, weak consumer confidence and the euro zone debt crisis. In August, loss-making Italian airline Meridiana-Air 
Italy axed two local flights to the southern Italian city of Bari in protest against what it called "unfair competition" by 
Ryanair. Ryanair rejected the accusation.

Etihad Airways would consider buying the Irish government's 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus but so far has not been 
approached with an offer, the Gulf carrier's chief executive said today.
"If the Irish government approached us to look at the stake, then we would do so. But they have still not approached 
us," James Hogan said on the sidelines of a conference in Abu Dhabi.
He declined to comment on Ryanair's bid to take over Aer Lingus, or on whether Etihad would sell its current 3 
percent stake in Aer Lingus.
Etihad has been on an aggressive expansion drive and has taken minority stakes in Aer Lingus, Air Berlin and 
Virgin Australia. Hogan said earlier this year that Etihad would look at India and Asian markets for new 
opportunities.
The airline has been approached by all Indian carriers about the possibility of buying a stake, Hogan said on 
Tuesday, adding that Etihad was still evaluating the impact of the new Foreign Direct Investment laws. India opened 
up its airline industry to foreign investment last month. Asked if Etihad would be looking for minority stakes, he said: 
"Everything we do will be minority stakes. What we don't want to do is to take control." He added that the carrier 
had no interest in Portugal's TAP, which is up for sale. "We are codeshare partners with TAP. However 
strategically, we do not see any value in investing in TAP." Gulf carriers have entered a series of codeshares and 
alliances this year, as they look to expand their networks. Qatar Airways became the first major Gulf carrier to join 
the oneworld alliance earlier this month; Etihad has signed a codeshare deal with Air France-KLM, a move that 
some analysts expected would result in the carrier becoming part of the SkyTeam alliance. However, Hogan denied 
any such plans. "We have no intention of joining SkyTeam," he said. ( C) Reuters

Sea offshore Ireland. This study indicated that a recovery range of 17-43pc was possible. One particular scenario 
involving a total of 41 horizontal producers and 22 horizontal water injectors over a 25-year life recovered 31pc of 
the oil in place. Providence has an 80pc stake in the licence and is operator. Shares in Providence jumped 25c to 
E8.75. Shares in Ryanair were flat at E4.54. Ryanair, which makes up c.70pc of Stansted's traffic, has withdrawn 
from the Stansted sale process. According the statement, it has been advised by BAA Stansted's owner, Ferrovial, 
that it will exclude Ryanair (and any Ryanair-related consortium) from the Stansted sale process. Ryanair has 
therefore written to all investors/consortia with which it has held discussions to advise them that Ryanair will not 
participate in the sale process or seek a minority stake.

Ryanair has bowed out of the competition to buy Stansted airport after saying owner BAA had indicated it would not 
sell the facility to any bidding consortium that included the low-cost carrier.
Ryanair, whose customers account for more than two-thirds of Stansted's traffic, had been talking to a number of 
parties interested in London's third-biggest airport, which went on sale in August .
It said yesterday it had told "all investors/consortiums it has held discussions with" that it would not seek a part in 
the bidding process or a minority stake.
It added: "We regret Ferrovial's decision to exclude Ryanair from the Stansted sale process and the failure of the 
Competition Commission to restrain this anti-competitive and anti-customer behaviour by Ferrovial [BAA's 
controlling shareholder]."
BAA and Ferrovial declined to comment.
UK competition authorities would have blocked the airline from taking any more than a 25 per cent stake in the 
airport and could have thrown up problems even for a smaller shareholding.
Analysts pointed out that any buyer of Stansted would eventually need to work with Ryanair to achieve growth at a 
facility that has seen traffic figures fall by a quarter in the past five years.
Damian Brewer at RBC Capital Markets questioned the wisdom of BAA excluding Stansted's biggest customer - if 
that was indeed the case. "It would seem strange behaviour and might even be a failure of their statutory duties to 
shareholders to get the most value from the asset," he said, adding that a buyer could always sell a stake to 
Ryanair following a deal with BAA. First-round bids for Stansted are due by the end of the month. The sale - 
Ryanair bows out over Stansted - Correction Appended
ordered by the Competition Commission in 2009 - is expected to raise about £1bn and attract a handful of global 
bidders including Manchester Airports Group in a partnership with Industry Funds Management of Australia.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, has been a fierce critic of BAA's management of Stansted. He raised 
the prospect of Ryanair taking part in a bid this spring.
Chris Tarry, an aviation consultant, argued the case for doing so was not clear. "No one has really asked Michael, 
'Is this the best use of your capital?' " he said. "And if it is, what does that say about Ryanair's model?"
Yesterday, the airline also appeared to back the approach by Aer Lingus - in which it holds a 30 per cent stake - to 
resolving a EUR750m hole in the pension plan for its workers and those of the Dublin Airport Authority.
The Irish flag carrier insists it is not liable for the deficit but has suggested making a contribution in the range of 
EUR100m in exchange for a four-year pay freeze for the vast bulk of its staff.
Correction
Ryanair does not support Aer Lingus's proposal to contribute an extra EUR100m to the Irish flag carrier's pension 
deficit, as incorrectly stated in an article on October 10.

RYANAIR yesterday dropped its efforts to buy a stake in Stansted, blaming the airport's owner Ferrovial for refusing 
to engage.
The budget carrier has written to all of its potential bidding partners to withdraw from the process, citing "Ferrovial's 
decision to exclude Ryanair from the Stansted sale".
Ryanair had been looking to take a 25 per cent stake in the airport as part of a consortium.
"While we fully accept that Ferrovial is entirely free not to sell to Ryanair, we fail to understand how it can comply 
with competition law if Stansted's biggest customer, accounting for 70 per cent of the traffic, is excluded from this 
sale process," said Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara.
A spokesperson for BAA, the airport operator controlled by Ferrovial, said the firm would not comment on any 
aspect of the sale process.
Possible buyers linked to Stansted so far include Manchester Airports Group as well as a string of banks and 
investment funds. Analysts expect the sale to bring in up to £1bn, with offers due by the end of the month.
BAA said in August it would sell off Stansted, after it lost a battle in the Court of Appeal to keep the London airport 
amid competition concerns.
The firm had been winding its way through the appeals system since 2009, when the Competition Commission 
ruled that the airport and others in Scotland must be sold off.
Ryanair bows out of Stansted Airport auction
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is a long-standing critic of the way Stansted is run, calling often for costs to be cut 
and slamming the "blatant mismanagement" of abandoned plans for a second runway. "The only way Stansted's 
traffic decline can be reversed is if its uncompetitive charges are significantly reduced, initially by reversing the 
disastrous 100 per cent price increase imposed by the BAA monopoly at Stansted in 2007," the firm said yesterday.

Stop windfarms, build a heliport
Concerned citizens of Benzie County in Michigan are setting up heliports in a bid to curb onshore windfarm 
development in their area. One town, Joyfield, could soon have up to eight licensed public heliports. It would give 
the settlement of 800 souls more heliports than the rest of Michigan combined.
According to the Traverse City Record Eagle, turbines can't be built near heliports for safety reasons. The article 
explains:
"Obtaining a public heliport permit is neither complicated nor expensive. It involves a one-time $25 application fee, 
a flat piece of grass and a drawing based on an official, US geographical survey.
"The owner also has to provide a phone for public use; parking area, sanitary facility, and sign on the road. The 
sanitary facility could be an outhouse or portable toilet."
The tactic has serious implications for the onshore wind-turbine industry. Local residents are divided.
"It seems pretty fishy to me," says Susan Zenker, who lives near one of the proposed heliports. "I know all of the 
people who have applied, and as far as I know not one of them has a helicopter."

This unfortunate typo on a Gatwick airport screen caught the eye of one of our sub-editors (frankly, we'd have been

wonders Peter.
Ryan where?
Can it be true? Ryanair - the carrier that is to customer care what French gossip magazines are to royal privacy - 
has opened a shop in Manchester where passengers can talk to real airline staff without paying a face-to-face 
surcharge.
But don't worry, Michael O'Leary hasn't gone soft. The frugally appointed former florists is a typical piece of guerilla 
marketing by the budget carrier. It is renting the property temporarily to promote its new Manchester services. Like 
Ryanair's cheapest fares, it will be gone in a few weeks.
When fast jets were Frightning
Mach 2 was a way of life for the RAF's Lightning pilots, making them the envy of their fast-jet jockey 
contemporaries. But the English Electric jet didn't earn the nickname "Frightning" for nothing, as a new book by 
Peter Caygill testifies.
Lightning Eject ([pounds sterling]19.99, hardback, Pen & Sword) examines what Caygill describes as "the dubious 
safety record" of the supersonic fighter.
There was a 6% chance that a Lightning pilot would suffer an engine fire and a one in four that he would not survive 
the experience - even F6 XR760 (pictured above) was lost due to one, although pilot Flt Lt Bob Bees ejected safely.
Caygill puts you in the cockpit as he chronologically recounts the incidents and accidents of what was surely one of 
the 20th century's most exciting fighters. A must-read for all Lightning aficionados and companion to Caygill's 
Lightning from the Cockpit.

Lee Bradshaw is national sales director for Schwarzkopf Professional in Ireland and director of the Schwarzkopf 
Irish Hairdressing Business Awards, which will take place this year in the Mansion House on October 22.
**The awards were established in 2003 to recognise and reward the business acumen and achievements of the 
Irish hairdressing industry.**
.....
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
The day-to-day running of the business and the direction and future growth of the Irish Hairdressing Business 
Awards. I wanted to break the mould for competitions in our industry by rewarding and recognising hairdressers' 
business prowess rather than their cutting, colouring and creative skills as many of our competitors do.
Our first ceremony in 2003 was held in a modest conference room at the Westbury Hotel, had four categories and 
attracted an audience of 75.
This year, we celebrate our tenth anniversary and will be handing out 20 awards with an anticipated audience of 
450 in attendance. This shows phenomenal growth and is a testament to Ireland's hairdressers.
**What motivates you in your job?**
From a sales point of view, very little beats the feeling of pitching for new business and getting it. More recently 
though, it was the response to the new Trainee of the Year category at the Schwarzkopf Irish Hairdressing 
Business Awards. Introduced in 2011, this category was added to help recognise the up-and-coming talent in the 
industry and attracted the most entries we have ever received for a single award.
**How would you describe your work style?**
Working Week: Lee Bradshaw
Driven and encouraging. Managers often spend too much time trying to catch people out. They miss the bigger 
opportunity that presents itself when they catch them doing something right.
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned so far?**
Be prepared to make occasional mistakes -- providing you learn from them. If you don't drop a clanger every now 
and again, you are not trying hard enough or pushing boundaries. Sometimes it is easier to seek forgiveness than 
ask permission.
**In Ireland, whose career do you most admire and why?**
Michael O'Leary. Love him or hate him, you can't ignore him or what he has achieved. Anybody that has the ability 
to build what he has over a relatively short period of time has to be admired even when, at times, the weight of 
public and professional opinion has been so against him.
Despite having to plan your journey meticulously and invest in a good set of scales, if you asked for a show of 
hands as to who has flown Ryanair, half the nation would have their arms in the air.
**Based on your experience, what is the most valuable career advice you can offer others?**
There is absolutely no substitute for hard work and determination -- skill sets and technique can be taught, work 
ethic usually can't.
**In terms of doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge we face? What would you like to 
see change?**
The banks' refusal to lend effectively at small-to-medium business level and the effect austerity has had. Our 
business relies ultimately on women walking through salon doors and booking in for services. At the height of the 
Celtic Tiger, the average client visit to a salon was every four to six weeks. Now, you're looking at once every eight 
to 10 or even 10 to 12 weeks.
Salons and manufacturers alike have had to reduce margins and get more savvy with their marketing and business 
offering. More important, they have had to gain a real understanding of the needs of the post-boom client.
Whether we like it or not, this trading climate is the new reality. It is not just a bump to get over before the good 
times roll again again. Make sure any plans you put in place are for the long haul.
**What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?**
To be making a speech at the 20th anniversary of the Schwarzkopf Irish Hairdressing Business Awards and driving 
Schwarzkopf Professional forward in both profile and sales.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has ratcheted up the battle to take over Aer Lingus with claims he would 
offer discount transatlantic fares if he owned the airline.
Mr O'Leary, in an interview with this newspaper, said he would offer E99 fares to the US if he succeeded in 
Ryanair's long-running attempt to take over the carrier.
Many will see his comments as a further volley in the propaganda war to get control of Aer Lingus -- currently being 
ruled on by the EU Commission.
"We will take bundles out of Aer Lingus's cost base. Instead of having E200 fares across the Atlantic we will have 
E99 fares in the winter," he claimed.
"How many flights do you think you can fill going to the States for E99? Every single one of them," he told our 
Business Week supplement. Ryanair, he said, would retain the Aer Lingus brand and the former state-owned airline 
would continue to fly to different airports. Average Aer Lingus fares would fall to E65 from E85 but would remain 
higher than the Ryanair average of E45, he claimed. "We have no desire to take Aer Lingus and paint yellow harps 
on them. We need a two-airline brand strategy," he added. The Irish Independent XXXX Denis O'Brien has avoided 
having to make a mandatory bid for the entire share capital of Independent News and Media after inadvertently 
breaching the takeover rules that govern public companies here. INM yesterday revealed that chairman Leslie 
Buckley, one of three representatives of Mr O'Brien on the media company's board, was forced to sell 100,000 
shares on Wednesday on the instructions of the Irish Takeover Panel. Mr Buckley was reappointed as a non-
executive director of INM on August 27th at an extraordinary general meeting and then appointed chairman. He had 
been kicked off the INM board by shareholders in mid-2011 following recommendations by shareholder advisory 
groups. His re-election meant the aggregate shareholding of Mr O'Brien and his three board nominees - Mr 
Roundup-NY for E99 says Ryanair News Roundup
Buckley, Lucy Gaffney and Paul Connolly - was 30.01 per cent. This is just above the threshold allowed under 
takeover panel rules before a mandatory bid for the entire company is triggered. Mr O'Brien is INM's biggest 
shareholder, with a holding of 29.88 per cent. He and his three board representatives are considered as connected 
parties for the purposes of the takeover rules that apply to listed companies. The Irish Times XXXX Venture Capital 
could create 21,000 jobs directly over the coming decade, if Ireland continues to build on its advantages in the 
medtech, technology and financial services sectors, the Irish Venture Capital Association chairman said last night. 
Manus Rogan said the level of venture capital investment activity in Ireland now compares favourably with our 
international peers. "We have evolved from generalist to specialised funds and, in recent years, have increased

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has ratcheted up the battle to take over Aer Lingus with claims he would 
offer discount transatlantic fares if he owned the airline.
Mr O'Leary, in an interview with this newspaper, said he would offer E99 fares to the US if he succeeded in 
Ryanair's long-running attempt to take over the carrier.
Many will see his comments as a further volley in the propaganda war to get control of Aer Lingus -- currently being 
ruled on by the EU Commission.
"We will take bundles out of Aer Lingus's cost base. Instead of having E200 fares across the Atlantic we will have 
E99 fares in the winter," he claimed.
"How many flights do you think you can fill going to the States for E99? Every single one of them," he told our 
Business Week supplement. Ryanair, he said, would retain the Aer Lingus brand and the former state-owned airline 
would continue to fly to different airports. Average Aer Lingus fares would fall to E65 from E85 but would remain 
higher than the Ryanair average of E45, he claimed. "We have no desire to take Aer Lingus and paint yellow harps 
on them. We need a two-airline brand strategy," he added. The Irish Independent XXXX Denis O'Brien has avoided 
having to make a mandatory bid for the entire share capital of Independent News and Media after inadvertently 
breaching the takeover rules that govern public companies here. INM yesterday revealed that chairman Leslie 
Buckley, one of three representatives of Mr O'Brien on the media company's board, was forced to sell 100,000 
shares on Wednesday on the instructions of the Irish Takeover Panel. Mr Buckley was reappointed as a non-
executive director of INM on August 27th at an extraordinary general meeting and then appointed chairman. He had 
been kicked off the INM board by shareholders in mid-2011 following recommendations by shareholder advisory 
groups. His re-election meant the aggregate shareholding of Mr O'Brien and his three board nominees - Mr 
Roundup-NY for E99 says Ryanair News Roundup
Buckley, Lucy Gaffney and Paul Connolly - was 30.01 per cent. This is just above the threshold allowed under 
takeover panel rules before a mandatory bid for the entire company is triggered. Mr O'Brien is INM's biggest 
shareholder, with a holding of 29.88 per cent. He and his three board representatives are considered as connected 
parties for the purposes of the takeover rules that apply to listed companies. The Irish Times XXXX Venture Capital 
could create 21,000 jobs directly over the coming decade, if Ireland continues to build on its advantages in the

Body
The main Dublin shares index slipped in to the red this morning ahead of this month's ECB policy committee 
meeting later today.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 8 points to 3,303.15.
The ECB is widely expected to hold base interest rates when it meets today. The euro zone's economy shrank 
0.2pc in the second quarter on an annualised basis and is in danger of shrinking again in the third. A recession is 
defined as two quarters of economic contraction in a row. Unemployment is at 11.4pc, the highest since the shared 
euro currency was introduced by the European Union in 1999. The ECB had eased investors' fears about Europe's 
financial crisis when it said in September that help was at hand for countries struggling with their debts.
The EBA (European Banking Authority) yesterday evening released its final report on the recapitalisation of 
European banks. The EBA set capital targets for European banks back in Q411 and the report yesterday updates 
the market on where the banks reside in the recapitalisation exercise at the end of June. Overall, the exercise led to 
an increase of E200bn of capital across the sector by June 2012 with the banks expected to achieve a 9pc core tier 
1 target. Bank shares here were unmoved. Ryanair published September traffic statistics yesterday. The airline 
carried 7.84m passengers in the month, up 8pc yoy with load factors down 1pc to 84pc. This wraps up the key July-
September quarter and Goodbody estimate that Ryanair has delivered an 8.5pc increase in passengers from a 
9.7pc rise in capacity (load factors c.1pc lower yoy). "Both are a little higher than envisaged in our model (8.1pc and 
8.3pc respectively)." "With no change to our cost growth or yield assumptions, the net impact from the higher pax 
figures (revenue) and capacity (costs) for the quarter would broadly balance out, leaving estimates unchanged. Q2 
results are due early November, where the main focus will be on the special dividend, the Q2 yield performance (we 
have +5.7pc) and winter yield guidance. On the winter guidance, the company has guided for a flat outturn, 
whereas we are more hopeful, sitting on +2.5pc," said analyst, Donall O'Neill. Shares in Ryanair rose 5c to E4.54.

Today's keenly awaited meeting of the ECB's policy committee failed to give the ISEQ the hoped-for lift as investors 
saw little concrete from the eurozone central bank.
At the close, the index was down 9.38 points to 3,301.77.
The euro notched a two-week high against the dollar and global shares edged higher after the head of the 
European Central Bank reiterated a commitment to preserve the euro. U.S. data showing the number of Americans 
filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week added to a positive tone in equity 
markets. Oil prices rebounded a day after registering a steep fall as escalating tensions between Syria and Turkey 
raised concerns over supplies from the Middle East. ECB President Mario Draghi, speaking after the bank held 
benchmark lending rates steady at 0.75 percent, said "the euro is irreversible." He also said the ECB is ready to buy 
the bonds of troubled euro-zone economies that ask for it.
The EBA (European Banking Authority) yesterday evening released its final report on the recapitalisation of 
European banks. The EBA set capital targets for European banks back in Q411 and the report yesterday updates 
the market on where the banks reside in the recapitalisation exercise at the end of June. Overall, the exercise led to 
an increase of E200bn of capital across the sector by June 2012 with the banks expected to achieve a 9pc core tier 
1 target. Bank shares here were unmoved. Ryanair published September traffic statistics yesterday. The airline 
carried 7.84m passengers in the month, up 8pc yoy with load factors down 1pc to 84pc. This wraps up the key July-
September quarter and Goodbody estimate that Ryanair has delivered an 8.5pc increase in passengers from a 
9.7pc rise in capacity (load factors c.1pc lower yoy). "Both are a little higher than envisaged in our model (8.1pc and 
8.3pc respectively)." "With no change to our cost growth or yield assumptions, the net impact from the higher pax 
figures (revenue) and capacity (costs) for the quarter would broadly balance out, leaving estimates unchanged. Q2 
results are due early November, where the main focus will be on the special dividend, the Q2 yield performance (we

Ryanair today held out fresh concessions to win approval to take over Aer Lingus , offering to move some of its 
rival's planes to continental Europe to operate non-Irish routes and allay concerns about a near monopoly in the 
domestic market.
Europe's biggest budget carrier said it would also scrap some of its own routes from Ireland to persuade anti-
monopoly regulators to reverse course after rejecting an earlier merger.
The European Commission is to rule by January on Ryanair's 700 million euro bid, seen as a long shot by analysts 
and investors who point to Aer Lingus's shares trading well below the bid price.
Ryanair had an initial bid turned down by the European Commission in 2007 and dropped a second offer in 2009. 
Ryanair has said it will submit a remedies package that will include commitments by rival airlines to operate some of 
the 36 routes on which it and Aer Lingus have no competitors. "The way we can get across the line is by cutting a 
certain number of Aer Lingus routes, cutting a certain amount of Ryanair routes and then maybe refocus Aer 
Lingus," Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara told a news conference today. "Instead of having a Belfast base, 
and a Gatwick base, they should have a Brussels base" to serve non-Irish routes, he said of Aer Lingus. Aer 
Lingus, which only operates from Ireland and Northern Ireland, could then compete with Brussels Airlines out of 
Brussels National airport and possibly with easyJet in destinations like Amsterdam. Ryanair has spoken to around 
10 airlines and charter operators. including Virgin, British Airways and Citijet, about taking over routes, McNamara 
said. "I'm not sure of the 10 if they have all said they would be interested, but there is certainly enough interest to 
form the remedies package," he said. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary met Willie Walsh, the head of British 
Airways's parent IAG, during the past three months to discuss the remedies package, he said. If the takeover 
succeeds, Ryanair would maintain Aer Lingus' branding and position it midway between easyJet and Ryanair,

cutting the average fare to 65 euros from 85 euros at present, compared with 45 euros at Ryanair, McNamara said. 
It would revamp business class service on transatlantic routes and cut off-season economy ticket prices.

The Mouth Of Ireland : The Hilarious World Of RyanAir CEO Michael O Leary

Body
Michael O Leary, the outrageous, colorful and arrogant (and very rich) chief executive of low-budget Irish air carrier 
Ryanair, is probably the most entertaining businessman in the world.
He's only 51 years old, but it seems like O Leary has been around forever, sparking outrage and offense with his 
comments about the airline industry, about passengers and about the world itself.
While O Leary is clearly a self-promoter who seeks to hog the spotlight as frequently as possible, almost every 
statement he makes has a kernel of truth at its core, which exacerbates the fury he often elicits.
He also consistently confounds expectations by criticizing and/or insulting the very institutions and individuals that 
have made him wealthy beyond imagination -- the Sunday Times of London valued his net worth at £355 million 
(about $573 million), making him the 20th richest person in Ireland.
He is, simultaneously, both infuriating and disarming   there are few, perhaps no, other chief executives who can 
remotely match his charismatic (and bizarre) personality and behavior.
In his most recent tirade, he claimed that he is  underpaid  and that holidays (i.e, the principal reason people fly on 
his airline) are a  waste of time.  He even bemoaned his own air carrier s practice of charging substantial baggage 
fees (despite the fact that it was essentially he who imposed these levies to make up for the rather cheap fares).
Herewith follows a list of some of O Leary s choicest quotes compiled over the years.
*On his value as an executive:
 [I am Europe s] most underpaid and underappreciated boss. I m paid about 20 times more than the average 
employee [at Ryanair], and I think the gap should be wider. I was paid  1.2-million last year for carrying 80 million 
passengers. [Irish rival] Aer Lingus' boss [Christoph Mueller] got  1.3-million for carrying [only] 9 million passengers. 
*On why he takes holidays, though he considers them a  waste of time. 
 I do it because I have a wife and four children who insist that I have to go away every year otherwise they will be 
traumatized. Of course, I fly Ryanair, but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage. 
*On Suzy McLeod, the British woman who gained a tremendous amount of media attention and public sympathy 
after Ryanair charged more than  200 to print five boarding passes from a flight from Spain to UK (since she failed 
to print them out beforehand).
 As you know, there are no internet cafés in Alicante [Spain], there are no hotels

EASYJET shares soared 3.5 per cent yesterday after it raised its profit forecasts thanks to a jump in post-Olympic 
traffic.
The budget carrier's chief executive Carolyn McCall said demand from London "increased towards the upper end of 
expectations" after the Games, helping to lift its pre-tax profits to between £310m and £320m for the year to the end 
of September, up from £280m to £300m.
However, the company said that currency movements and a bigger fuel bill are adding to cost pressures.
EasyJet said a strong rise in summer bookings from Britain to Malaga and Alicante in Spain and Faro in Portugal 
had helped revenue per seat by as much as 5.5 per cent in the last six months. Annual passenger numbers rose by 
7.1 per cent to 58.4m.
"McCall's second full year in charge has delivered another impressive increase in profits. That's no mean feat in 
view of the oil price," said Charles Stanley analyst Douglas McNeill.
Ryanair also reported a late summer lift yesterday, with passenger numbers in September up eight per cent on last 
year to 7.84m.
Meanwhile British Airways owner IAG said traffic rose 8.7 per cent on last year to 5.1m, helped by the acquisition of 
BMI boosting domestic UK and Spanish traffic by a quarter.
Excluding the acquisition, traffic rose by an underlying 3.7 per cent. IAG credited its post-Olympic sale for some of 
the gains.
EasyJet , Ryanair and IAG are helped by post-Games boost
First and business-class travel rose eight per cent, while non-premium traffic was up 4.6 per cent.
The firm said trading conditions remained good in London, but warned of continuing economic turbulence at its 
Madrid base.
Shares in IAG closed up 2.96 per cent at 163.7p.

It will be hard for European regulators to come up with compelling reasons to block Ryanair's latest bid to take over 
rival Aer Lingus, the airline said today.
The European Commission is currently reviewing the airline's E694m offer with a decision expected in January.
The no-frills airline said it is working with up to ten other airlines and charter companies to deal with any competition 
issues that the EU watchdog might have regarding routes.
"I think it's going to be difficult for Brussels this time to come up with reasons to block it," said Ryanair spokesman, 
Stephen McNamara. Mr McNamara stood by claims made by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary in today's Irish 
Indepedent that they would offer E99 transatlantic flights if they took over Aer Lingus. He said they would look at 
revamping business class on Aer Lingus flights to attract more passengers. The airline was unveiling an additional 
daily return flight between Dublin and Brussels Charleroi from November to mark Ireland's upcoming European 
Presidency.
