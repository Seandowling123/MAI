   Apr. 6, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 The story behind the Ryanair paid bathroom concept is a really weird one. The idea was first mentioned by their 
slightly insane CEO, Michael O'Leary. Then the story was            debunked by their own spokesperson. 
And now, in a not so surprising twist, the airline has confirmed that paid bathrooms will indeed be coming to their 
planes -albeit in a phased introduction. 
The "pay to pee" facilities will cost one pound or one euro - so international passengers on Ryanair better make 
sure they carry correct change. 
According to Ryanair, they are working with Boeing (NYSE:BA)  to redesign the cabin, and develop the coin 
operated doors. The whole idea behind paid bathrooms is designed to force passengers to use the bathroom before 
or after the flight - and the final objective is to remove one or two bathrooms from all Ryanair planes, creating more 
space for seats. And more seats means (even) lower prices. You can't really argue with their logic. 
There is a spot of good news though - the paid bathrooms won't be introduced until after the busy summer season.

   Mar. 24, 2010 The Dallas Morning News delivered by Newstex) --It's easy to get caught up in doom and gloom 
over the airline industry. After all, as the            International Air Transport Association estimated this month, 
industry losses in 2009 totaled $9.4 billion.We have            Airline Weeklyto put things in perspective. 
The publication pointed out in its March 15 issue that the industry's losses were concentrated on a small handful of 
players: "Last year was indeed a tumultuous one for airlines, but keep in mind that of the $10b in net losses at 
carriers tracked by Airline Weekly, roughly three quarters of the red ink flowed at just five airlines: Japan Airlines 
(OOTC:JALFQ) , Air France/ KLM, American, United and Delta. (NYSE:DAL)  "Take out the losses of four more 
airlines -- All Nippon, British Airways, Air Canada (TSX:AC')  (OOTC:AIDIF)  (TSX:AC'B)  (TSX:AC'A)  (TSX:ACE'B)  
and US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  -- and guess what? The industry was collectively profitable last year."Huh? We had 
to check that out, and sure enough, Airline Weekly nailed it.Using today's exchange rates, the first five it mentioned 
lost more than $7 billion as a group. The other four lost close to $1.5 billion. Add them together, and we're talking 
about $8.6 billion in losses from those nine carriers.We could throw in Continental Airlines (NYSE:CAL) , which lost 
$282 million; Lufthansa, which lost $167 million; SAS Group, which lost $405 million; and we're up to the IATA 
numbers.All that supports Airline Weekly's conclusion that "it's safe to say that industry losses last year, as bad as 
they seem, were heavily concentrated at a few giant laggards."That makes one overlook the fact that a lot of 
airlines were profitable, led by Ryanair's net income of over $500 million.Keep reading for a chart of 2009 net 
income by the big losers, with non-U.S. carrier results shown based on currency rates as of March 24.Figures in

   Mar. 6, 2010 (AMERICAblog delivered by Newstex) -- 
           
Jojo and I did a quick three day weekend down to Bergamo, Italy last weekend to meet family. Our cousin recently 
started working down there and with cheap tickets on RyanAir (the pay toilets and "           other offerings" airline) it 
was hard to pass up. RyanAir was better than expected and they haven't yet implemented the pay toilet program, 
thankfully. Sort of like EasyJet but blue and yellow instead of orange. The town sits in the foothills of the Alps and is 
relatively close to Milano. The town is very tidy and the people very chic, though that always seems to be the case 
in that region. Someone told us that Italian men spend seven times the amount of money than the French each 
year.
I was curious about the politics and heard that it's very religious and very conservative. I also asked about the 
recent problems related to race could occur in a country that is so well known for its hospitality. The theory is that 
Italy has traditionally been a place where people leave but in recent years instead of emigration, it's had much more 
immigration. It doesn't excuse the behavior at all though it possibly answers a few questions. It would be nice to see 
the government do much more to combat this problem but the current regime is more focused on promoting hard 
right ideas and attractive women. Is the left there any better? Maybe someone out there who lives in Italy or knows 
more about the internal politics can tell us more.
More photos below.
The inside of the caffe above. It looks like it probably used to be a barn though that's only a guess. Very pleasant 
and of course, excellent coffee, as it almost always is in Italy. Cheap compared to Paris as well. French coffee is 
OK but generally too bitter.
Bergamo, Italy
Some amazing columns at the Cappella Colleoni. (I see it also listed as Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore so if 
anyone knows, please jump in. I know we have a reader who is an expert on touring Italy.) I wish there was a bit 
better light but the day was gray.
           
The old fortified town goes up a hill so they have two funiculars to take people up and down. This is at the top, near 
the castello. I loved the building and this gate.
           
A little plaza with a restaurant at the top of the town, next to the funiculare. Great views over the valley and the 
lower part of the upper town.
           
If we understood the sign correctly, it was an archeological dig. It has to be impossible to plant a shovel in the 
ground without hitting something historical there. The sign was dated in 2008 so I'm guessing this project might not 
move. Ever.
           
I was thrilled to find a little Sunday market while taking a walk. They offered local products so I added some cheese, 
fresh sausage and a dried sausage to bring back home.
           
A local band singing American country music. A bit strange but why not?
           
A very bike friendly town with it's own bike rental service and bike lanes. The surrounding area is very flat but the 
town itself has plenty of hills so there are five gears compared to the three speeds on the Paris Velib bikes. Lots of 
riders on the weekend including families.
           
The view from the castello at the top of Bergamo. The Alps are nearby and there's plenty of snow up there!
           
There's nothing quite like parking in Italy.
           
At the airport a pizza machine. I blogged about this a while back when they were first coming out. I didn't try it but it 
looked OK. Maybe next time.

    Gulliver       Ryanair's lottery       A.B. | LONDON       Don't eat the card    
IF YOU'RE having a bad day, consider this:
A man flying from Krakow to East Midlands Airport with Ryanair on February 25th won ??10,000 ($13,550) on an 
in-flight lottery scratchcard. But so annoyed was he, apparently, to discover that the money was not immediately 
available on the plane that he ate the winning card. Not the most logical of next steps. As a result he lost out on the 
winnings all together.
A company spokesman gave a typically Ryanair-ish response:
Passengers have always been delighted to claim their large cash prizes after returning home. Unfortunately our 
latest winner felt that we should have his 10,000 euros prize kicking around on the aircraft. Crew tried to stop the air 
Gourmet Scratch Card eater by offering him one of our great tasting sandwiches, pizzas or snacks instead, but 
clearly he had much more expensive tastes!

 Despite all the weird things Ryanair manages to do to its passengers, they do have their fair share of wacky 
passengers as well. 
During one of their flights this week, a passenger purchased a scratchcard lottery ticket (one of the many ways 
Ryanair makes money). When he uncovered the numbers, he turned out to be the lucky winner of ??10,000 (about 
$13,600). 
And this is where the story takes a twist for the weird - when the passenger was told that he would have to send his 
ticket in for verification, and that the cabin crew don't fly around Europe with that kind of cash, he got furious. 
Normal people would throw a tantrum, calm down, and accept the situation. Instead, the lucky winner ate his ticket. 
Right in front of all his fellow passengers, this guy actually ate a $13,600 winning lottery ticket. The only upside to 
this story is that the winning prize money will go unclaimed, so it can be donated to charity. I'm not sure whether 
alcohol or just plain stupidity played a role here, but it sure seems like one of the dumbest ways to throw away 
money.

You thought you've had expensive meals? An angry guy on a Ryanair flight ate a winning 10,000 euro scratch-off 
ticket he bought on board because he couldn't redeem it on board.
The equals about $13,600 in U.S. dollars.
On Ryanair's web site, spokesman Stephen McNamara had these quotes:
 "In the last two year's Ryanair's scratch cards have given away 10 cars, over ??300,000 in cash prizes and over 
100,000 flight vouchers. Passengers have always been delighted to claim their large cash prizes after returning 
home. Unfortunately our latest winner felt that we should have his ??10,000 prize kicking around on the aircraft. 
"Yesterday's events prove that while Ryanair's scratch cards offer large cash prizes they clearly taste great too! 
Crew tried to stop the gourmet scratch card eater by offering him one of our great tasting sandwiches, pizzas or 
snacks instead, but clearly he had much more expensive tastes!
"Ryanair is now asking passengers to vote on which type of charity Ryanair should donate the ??10,000 prize 
money to with one charity from anger management, eating and digestive disorders to disruptive children's and 
mental health charities now set to benefit from a real meal ticket!"
The unhappy passenger was flying from Krakow, Poland, to East Midlands, England.
Can the guy claim the prize, once the anger and the ticket leave his system? Just wondering.

Let's have one more weird story heading into the weekend: a $13,600 snack

   Feb. 19, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 A planeload of passengers on a Ryanair flight from the UK to Lanzarote (one of the Spanish Canary Islands) 
learned the hard way that low cost carriers carry a hidden price.
 Instead of landing in Lanzarote, the plane landed in Fuerteventura (about 30 miles from their intended destination). 
Bad weather had forced the plane to divert, but usually when a plane has to divert, a normal airline takes care of its 
customers.
 Obviously, Ryanair isn't considered to be a normal airline, so the passengers were told to get off the plane, and 
after refueling, the plane took off, leaving the passengers to fend for themselves.
 There were no Ryanair staff at the airport, and with no way to reach anyone from the airline, the passengers had to 
book hotels for themselves.
 The next morning, the passengers were able to grab a ferry to their correct destination, losing a night of their 
vacation and any hotel nights they had booked.
 A Ryanair spokesman confirmed that the flight had indeed been diverted, but was quick to point out that "if flight 
disruption is outside the control of the airline, no monetary compensation is due."
 So there you have it - flying with Ryanair really is a gamble, and you don't even know whether you'll actually arrive 
at your destination. Perhaps they can make some more money by starting a "will we get to our destination" lottery 
on their flights.

   Feb. 12, 2010 (Minyanville delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Stocks scored good gains as continuing unemployment claims touched a one year low and Greeks and geeks both 
bore gifts. European aid to Athens alleviated investor nerves and Geeknets 13.17% increase paced a broad based 
equity advance. Alcoa (AA) surged 3.19% in a commendable commodity tape; ahead of Valentines Day who knew 
aluminum would do more to            advance romance than engagement ring retailer Blue Nile (NILE), which 
swooned 13.05% after hours? Meanwhile World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which fell 1.17% on a day of triple 
digit gains, could use fresh leadership but new CIT (CIT) CEO John Thain is now otherwise engaged. Pity, for he 
has extensive experience            in the ring.
Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker? As a seduction technique for Sunday this may be swell but it was at best a 
mixed bag as a stock picking strategy. Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) shares plumped up a solid 2.07% ahead of 
earnings but drinks giant Diageo (DEO) disappointed with a 6% drop in operating profit. A Deutsche Bank 
(NYSE:DB)  downgrade of Boston Scientific (BSX) sent the heart stent maker sliding 9.89%; Bill Clinton, who had to 
hastily abandon plans to spend Lincolns birthday in the Lincoln Bedroom,            felt their pain. And it was a busy 
day for Michael Jackson, who made both a            beyond the grave appearance on We Are The World and a            
beyond the pale assertion that Toyotas (TM) impact on AutoNation (AN) will be œminor. Today in economics, 
expect February consumer sentiment at 9:55AM Eastern while Duke Energy (DUK), HCP Inc (HCP), Ingersoll-Rand 
(IR), Michelin, Nordic American Tanker (NAT), and ThyssenKrupp all announce earnings.

favors the bulk commodity companies.

Underperform and increases its objective to $25 from $19, following above-estimated earnings on strength in time-
share sales. See also            Four Reasons to Check In With Marriott.

see            Which Airline Stocks Still Have Room to Fly.
Blue Nile (NILE): The jeweler is now Sell (from Hold) at Benchmark as it appears luxury items such as diamond 
engagement rings may not recover materially beyond easy comparisons.

   Jan. 22, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Introducing another new blogger at Gadling, Darren Murph. . .
Where was your photo taken: Just below South Point Park on the very southern tip of the Big Island of Hawaii, 
which is unequivocally my favorite state in America. It's the southernmost point of the entire United States, which 
gave me a great sense of pride when seeing the (not technically) Southernmost Point Buoy in Key West. 
Where do you live now: Raleigh, North Carolina, y'all!
Scariest airline flown: A Continental flight from Newark to Raleigh in late 2003. I'm fairly certain we flew directly 
through one of the most turbulent thunderstorms this world has ever seen. Extreme drops in altitude, terrified flight 
attendants and a lady beside me that "came to Jesus" during the voyage to really cap things off. If I'm being 
completely honest, it was the only time in the sky where I had a very genuine fear that I may not land in one piece. 
Oh, and I've flown Ryanair as well -- no sweat there! 
Favorite city/country/place:  I'm going to take some liberties with this one. My favorite city in the world is Köln, 
Germany. There's nothing quite like stepping off of the train, hanging a left and being greeted by the towering 
Cathedral (or Dom, as it were). The entire city is awe-inspiring, and the aged beauty and warm locals give it a leg 
up over the more well-known Berlin. My favorite country is the United States of America. I've yet to encounter 
another nation where cowboys, nomads, beach bums and mountaineers all feel at home, and the sheer amount of 
variety makes it a treasure trove for explorers. I can cruise the Highway to Hana and call a moose my friend in 
Denali National Park without ever needing a passport -- not bad, eh? I just can't settle on a favorite place, so here's 
two: the gorgeous isle of Maui and the snowmobiler's heaven that is Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.

 Stocks skidded by the most in a month on Friday, falling from their highest levels since October of ˜08 and ending 
the week in the red as earnings season opened inauspiciously. Even as some investments maintained fiscal fitness, 
others sagged like so many New Rears resolutions. Treadmill titan Nautilus (NLS) raised the roof with a 22% 
advance ahead of the long weekend while Weight Watchers (WTW), down 1.02%, fell through the floor. (Where it 
evidently has many members            for company.)
As the world mourned an Alligator, financial executives shed crocodile tears on Capitol Hill. And Northern Ireland 
was rocked by a            political scandal whose script may one day Graduate to a movie. Its a quiet day in economic 
data but expect earnings out of Citigroup (C), Cree (CREE), CSX Corp (CSX), Fastenal (FAST), Forest Labs (FRX), 
IBM (IBM), Parker Hannifin (PH), PetMed Express (PETS),and TD Ameritrade (AMTD).
Initiations
Biotech Stocks: Biogen Idec (BIIB) is initiated at a Buy ($70 target price) at Standpoint Research, which says the 
firm should benefit from funds rotating out of high beta stocks and into healthcare. McKesson (MCK) also gets a 
Buy at the same broker as it is best-positioned to benefit from increased demand for generic drugs. See also            
How to Play Generic Drug Stocks.
Darden Restaurants (DRI): The stock is also picked up with a Buy and $45 target at Standpoint as the chain is well 
placed to gain from a spending rebound.
Supervalu (SVU): SVU is started at Buy by Standpoint as headwinds are beginning to reverse.
Ryanair (RYAAY): UBS (NYSE:UBS)  initiates low cost carrier Ryanair at a Buy.
Upgrades & Downgrades: McDonald's Bulks Up
CIT Group (CIT): The stock is resumed with a Buy at Stifel Nicolaus, $46 target.
Upgrades
McDonalds (MCD): The restaurant chain is upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse and its target 
taken to $71 from $69. Current estimates and valuation fail to adequately reflect the companys ability to build upon 
market share gains.
Vale SA (VALE): Barclays (NYSE:BCS)  boosts mining play Vale SA (Overweight from Equal-weight) and increases 
its price objective to $39 from $31.
Host Hotels (HST): Bank of America/Merrill Lynch hoists Host Hotels to Buy from Neutral.
Total SA (TOT): European oil giant Total SA (NYSE:TOT)  gets taken to Buy from Hold at Collins Stewart.
US Steel (X): The stock gets a Buy-from-Hold increase at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) , with the price objective up a 
steep $77 from $44, due to the attractiveness of its integrated business (OOTC:IGRB)  model.
Xilinx (XLNX): The stock is upped to Outperform from Sector Perform at RBC Capital on continued improvement in 
enterprise spending.
Tibco Software (TIBX): TIBX is taken to Outperform from Sector Perform at Pacific Crest with a target of $12.
Louisiana-Pacific (LPX): The stock is upgraded to Outperform from Sector Perform at RBC Capital.
Ciena (CIEN): The tech stock is up sharply ahead of the open after an Outperform-from-Neutral upgrade at Credit 
Suisse, with the target now $19 from $15.50. Ongoing momentum in revenue growth is expected.
Philip Morris International (PM): The tobacco company is upgraded to Outperform at Credit Suisse on an exchange 
rate improvement.
Downgrades
Burger King (BKC): The fast-food chain is cut to Neutral from Outperform at Credit Suisse, the price objective also 
being reduced by $2 to $21. Heightened franchisee tensions are among unfavorable factors cited.
Daimler AG (DAI): The stock is downgraded to Neutral from Buy at Nomura.
Baxter International (BAX): Citigroup (NYSE:C)  reduces Baxter International (NYSE:BAX)  to Hold from Buy.
Genworth Financial (GNW): Bank of America/Merrill lowers Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW PRE)  (NYSE:GNW) , 
now Neutral from Buy.
HSBC Holdings (HBC): BNP Paribas takes HSBC (NYSE:HBC)  Holdings to Underperform from Neutral.
BHP Billiton (BHP): The oil stock gets downgraded to Hold from Buy by ING Group. (NYSE:ING)  See also            
Two Ways to Play: OPEC Unlikely to Cut Supply.
Bare Escentuals (BARE): Suntrust cuts Bare Escentuals (NASDAQ:BARE)  (Neutral from Buy) after last weeks 
announcement it will be acquired by Japans Shiseido.
Upgrades & Downgrades: McDonald's Bulks Up
IMAX Corp. (IMAX): The stock is lower before the bell after Merriman cut it to Sell from Neutral due to valuation.
Dr. Reddys Labs (RDY): Deutsche Bank takes Dr. Reddys Labs to Sell from Hold on concerns a resurgent Teva 
(TEVA) could crowd-out large generic companies across markets.
JA Solar (JASO): The solar energy stock is now Neutral from Buy at Broadpoint Research.

 Around this time last year, Ryanair made the news when its quirky CEO announced his plans to charge 
passengers for using the bathroom. The inital reaction was that of amusement, then when people realized the guy 
was serious, people started questioning his mental health.
The news died down, but apparently the folks in Dublin have been working hard behind the scenes to actually 
become the first airline in the world with paid bathrooms. 
In fact, the airline is taking things one step further by removing two of the three bathrooms on the plane, and adding 
more sears. End result? One pay-to-pee bathroom and a 5% decrease in ticket prices.
The entire scheme actually makes perfect sense, especially since the airline is using the modification to lower 
prices even more. Of course, this is going to be bad news for people with a bladder problem, or those that enjoy 
taking their photo in the airplane bathroom. 
No announcement has been made when Ryanair passengers will need to bring pee pee money, but knowing how 
efficient they are, it may be sooner rather than later.

   Jan. 17, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 In a recent interview with a Dutch newspaper, Ryanair founder Michael O'Leary sat down to discuss the future of 
his airline. The fastest growing airline in the world still operates out of a tiny office complex in Dublin, with no 
intention of moving to the kind of slick all-glass towers his competitors fill. 
When asked about the crisis in the aviation world, he laughs - "what crisis". In 2009, the Irish low cost carrier 
transported 66 million passengers, up from 58 million in 2008. But better yet - they managed to double their profits. 
In just under 6000 square feet, the airline takes care of their sales, marketing, HR and web site management. 
Nobody uses email to discuss anything - they believe that getting up out of your chair and walking to the person in 
question is far more efficient. 
In 2009, the average price of a Ryanair ticket was just 28 euros (about $40). Even with those low prices, the airline 
can make a profit. The key to their success, according to O'Leary, is to use smaller regional airports and to stick to 
a very simple principle - your ticket get you a seat and nothing else. 
Ryanair has often been the source of jokes, mostly started by the airline itself. When they say they'll add a coin slot 
to airplane bathrooms, people laugh, but O'Leary is dead serious. In 2010, they plan to remove some of the 
bathrooms on their planes, giving them room to add more seats. With just one bathroom and a coin slot, ticket 
prices can once again go down a little.
O'Leary also revealed that he'll hand over control of his airline to someone else in two or three years. Despite his 
success, he dislikes the aviation world claiming "profit margins are slimmer than at the local grocery store".
When asked about his transatlantic plans, he still insists that the airline is serious - it won't be part of the current 
Ryanair, but flying a plane full of people from Europe to the US should be possible for around $15 per ticket. Like in 
Europe, a transatlantic Ryanair would most likely make use of smaller regional airports. If he ever pulls this off, he 
admits that he'd need to do it in one big blow - lots of planes, lots of destinations. Given how successful O'Leary 
has proven to be, I don't think anyone in the aviation world should ever doubt he can succeed.

Air Asia and Jetstar Form an Alliance, But Youll Never Notice

   Jan. 7, 2010 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --
If I told you that two of the largest low cost carriers in the Asia Pacific region got together to form an alliance, that 
would be pretty big news, right?  Well, thats what is happening now as Jetstar and Air Asia have decided to link up.  
This is big news, but for passengers, its not news at all.  This is going to be a            behind-the-scenes link for now, 
but I wouldnt rule out bigger changes up front later on.
For those who arent familiar, Air Asia is the monster of the low cost carrier world in Southeast Asia.  They started 
out with a couple used 737s, but theyve now grown into a behemoth.  They should be flying 100 airplanes by the 
end of this year, most of which are A320s.  They have plenty more on order as well, effectively trying to turn 
themselves into the Asian version of Ryanair (though, funny enough, unlike Ryanair, with European-built airplanes).  
Theyve also recently started Air Asia X for long haul low cost flying with A330s.  (Strange fact: Air Asia X 
inexplicably sponsors the Oakland Raiders despite a) them not flying anywhere on this continent and b) the Raiders 
absolutely sucking.)
Jetstar has taken a different path.  They are a very rare specimen “ a successful low cost airline within an airline.  
They are a part of Qantas and are about half the size of Air Asia in terms of fleet.  They have a bunch of A320s 
buzzing around Australia, and they added long haul flying on A330s.  Theyve grown their Jetstar Asia (and Jetstar 
Pacific in Vietnam) product in the same region as Air Asia, but they dont actually overlap that much.
Jetstar started the consolidation party by merging with Valuair a few years back.  Youll still see Valuair flying 
airplanes but the branding is Jetstar these days.  Now, Jetstar is getting together with Air Asia, but its not like you 
think.
This alliance is supposedly all about cost savings.  Theyre going to get together to try to build purchasing power for 
fuel, ground handling, airplanes, and more.  The airplane piece is particularly interesting in that theyre really going 
Air Asia and Jetstar Form an Alliance, But Youll Never Notice
to try to push the development of the successor to the 737 and A320 airplanes.  They want the next generation so 
they can drive down costs.
There are some really good points in a blog post over at Plane Talking covering the announcement.  Air Asia is 
really focused on driving down costs “ lower costs means they can lower fares and stimulate travel.  Theyre gonna 
make money on volume.  And its been working for them so far.
This does put an abrupt end to the rumors swirling about            Air Asia and Virgin Blue coming together to create 
an ultra low cost carrier in Australia.  Thats probably a good thing.  Theres already a blood bath in that country, so 
they dont need any more rock bottom fares.
All eyes are now on Tiger Airways, the biggest competitor in the region.  Tiger not only flies around Southeast Asia, 
but they opened up an Australian division as well.  They dont appear to be making money on that, and this is likely 
to put more pressure on them.  If Air Asia and Jetstar can lower costs and fares, that cant be good for Tiger.
Now, will this spill over into a customer-facing alliance?  I dont see why it wouldnt some day.  Though Qantas has 
done a good job with Jetstar, why not join forces with Air Asia and let the leader in the space run your low cost

   Jan. 5, 2010 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Rarely does a week go by without some kind of news blasting Ryanair for something the low cost carrier did to 
annoy their customers. 
This time, it all revolves around a silly payment method implemented by Ryanair. For years, the airline has been 
advertising its ultra low cost fares without mentioning additional fees or surcharges. 
New regulations in the UK mean Ryanair has to include credit card payment fees in all its advertising materials - but 
sneaky Ryanair found a way around this rule.
By creating one free payment method, the airline can get away with advertising its tickets, without mentioning a 
GBP5 surcharge for each passenger that uses a credit card. 
The "free" payment method is only available with a specific Mastercard prepaid card. All other payment methods 
are hit with the surcharge - for every single passenger, even if the tickets are all purchased on the same card.
The UK Office of Fair Trading investigated the matter, and called it "puerile and childish" - though I doubt Ryanair 
cares what anyone else thinks. The law is on their side, and they found a smart way around it. Sure, it may be a 
smart way that once again penalizes its customers, but at the end of the day, their fares are still substantially lower 
than any other European carrier.

   Dec. 29, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 The way birds migrate has inspired a discovery of how to reduce the amount of jet fuel planes use.
The characteristic V formation that many species take when migrating long distances produces an effect called 
updraft. The air is pushed down by the bird ahead in formation, making it easier for the bird behind to create enough 
lift to keep going.
A team at Stanford University led by Professor Ilan Kroo suggests that airplanes do the same. The first jet in the V 
would essentially clear the way for easier flying for those behind.
This research isn't new. Back in 1914 the German scientist Carl Wieselsberger first calculated the effects of updraft.
A French team studying pelicans found that flying in formation helped flocks fly 70% further than birds flying alone.
The Stanford team ran a simulation of three passenger jets leaving Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and San Francisco 
rendezvousing over Utah before continuing on to the East Coast. They found the planes would use 15% less fuel, 
cutting the airlines' major expense and carbon output in the process.
So will Ryanair slash rates even more by having their jets fly in formation to cheap holiday destinations, passing the 
savings to us along with cups full of ice water minus the water? Probably not. All the world's flight paths would have 
to be rearranged, costing a huge amount and inevitably leading to some embarrassing near disaster. It is a cool 
idea, though. 
Just a thought--I'd always heard that the V formation was all about dominance in the flock, with the strongest birds 
being closer to the front. Perhaps the reason the strongest go in front is to make it easier for the weaker ones. 
Having the leaders prove their strength actually helps the whole flock migrate.

 Ryanair passengers stuck for five hours on the tarmac at London Stansted last Monday were given ice cubes to 
fight the stuffy, hot conditions. Just the cubes. Suck on that.
Six inches of snow fell tauntingly outside as passengers cooked, free of air conditioning, and flight attendants 
claimed that it was against regulations for them to hand out water.
"A Ryanair spokesman claimed that cabin staff could not open the bar while the aircraft was on the ground due to 
'Inland Revenue laws'. The Air Transport Users' Council, the aviation watchdog, disputes this, adding that there is 
no law to prevent staff from handing out a few free cups of water," reports the Sydney Morning Herald.
The Irish airline is famous for cutting every corner to ensure low prices, including            Michael O'Leary's pay-to-
pee plan, charging for infants who sit on your lap, and hidden fees which make your total price a lot higher than you 
had anticipated when you clicked on that low fare. 
Refusing to serve water to anyone for five hours on a hot, grounded airplane, when the water was certainly 
available, in this blogger's opinion, ought to be treated as a crime. Imagine sitting for five hours in a stifling plane, 
asking for water, and the flight attendant telling you "no." Imagine them saying "no" to your grandmother and your 
kids. I can't believe there wasn't a mutiny.

Ryanair is saying it might ditch            Italy ... and it's not just a publicity stunt. The low-cost airline says that new 
rules on which forms of identification are acceptable for boarding compromise security. The new reg,            from 
Italy's civil aviation authority, ENAC, makes licenses for driving, fishing and hunting fine for use at the gate, along 
with government badges and other documents. 
This isn't good enough for Ryanair. Michael O'Leary, the company's CEO, said in a statement, "We are really sorry 
for the inconveniences that this decision will cause." He continued, "It's completely inappropriate for ENAC to 
introduce measures that reduce security on Italian domestic flights, compared with the security measures 
successfully used on all Ryanair flights in the EU and all Ryanair domestic flights in every other EU country."
In protest - and, ostensibly, for security concerns - Ryanair is keeping its domestic flights among 10 Italian airports 
grounded from January 23, 2010 until the issue is fixed to O'Leary's satisfaction.

The fun stuff was the            lunch with the FT.Not a word about a shift of strategy. 
Eventually, I make out the words on the wrapper and blurt: “Oh! A bagel!”
“It’s got pesto,” says O’Leary. “It was either that or McDonald’s. I figured you for a bagel girl.”
The staff get another pasting as he moves on to talk about management consultants (“should all be euthanised”) 
and MBAs (“bullshit”). “MBA students come out with, ‘The customer’s always right,? he says, adopting a whiny 
voice. “Horseshit! The customer’s usually wrong! And, ‘My staff is my most important asset.’ Bullshit! Staff is usually 
your biggest cost!”
It is hard to say how serious he is about this….
The real stuff is the noisy pull-out of a deal with Boeing .
RYANAIR SAID yesterday it had pulled out of talks to buy 200 aircraft from Boeing and would now trim investment 
from 2011 to cut costs and free up cash to pay to investors, lifting its shares.
 For The Times, this means a            brake on cheap fares.

The fiasco of Unites strike ballot of BA staff brings back memories of the 1970s when the Trade Unions were 
immensely powerful. Their leaders, now mostly dead, were household names and strikes were endemic “ most 
notably at the Longbridge and Halewood car plants. The economic damage was immense and no politician “ until 
Mrs Thatcher hove into view “ was prepared to tackle the Trade Unions head-on. But successive Acts of Parliament 
in the early 1980s virtually emasculated them. As manufacturing industry declined, so did their clout.
Now, with a modest domestic car manufacturing base, a coal industry “ under the struggling UK Coal “ which is a 
shadow of its former self and a declining steel sector, union disruption has been minimal. Indeed, in the latters 
case, every effort has been made to save the Tata-owned Redcar steelworks, whose closure was confirmed 
recently.
However, there are two companies where union power remains entrenched. Despite BAs privatization, it still 
remains heavily overstaffed, especially compared with such highly successful operations as Easyjet and Ryanair: 
admittedly, neither flies regularly beyond Europe.
Strong management is needed if BA is to prosper. Perhaps, Ryanairs garrulous “ and acerbic “ Chief Executive, 
Michael OLeary, should be piloted into the Chief Executives seat. And, of course, like an eternal millstone around 
its neck, is BAs accursed £3.7 billion pension deficit.
Poor productivity is also an endemic problem at Royal Mail “ and similar solutions are needed. In terms of 
ownership, privatization “ under a strict regulatory regime as applied to the water sector “ offers the best option. Of 
course, in terms of economic damage, Trade Unions can validly point to the unprecedented financial bill for 
supporting Royal Bank of Scotland inter alia.
The Brothers twitch
But the BA scenario has seen the Brothers twitch once again. With heavy public sector job cuts almost inevitable 
after the Election, will Trade Union power now reassert itself?

 U.S. stock futures advanced Friday morning, indicating Wall Street is ready to reverse the negative trend of the last 
few days. Several strong and better-than-expected company reports late Thursday contributed to the changing 
atmosphere as investors regained confidence in companies' profit prospects.
Wall Street markets fell about 1.2% Thursday and the dollar surged as Greece's debt was downgraded; jobless 
claims registered a surprising weekly gain; FedEx (NYSE:FDX)  (FDX) issued a lackluster outlook.
Among stocks in the news this morning, Research in Motion (NASDAQ:RIMM)  (           RIMM), Oracle (           
ORCL) and Nike (NYSE:NKE)  (           NKE) all reported surprising quarterly figures and forecast improved 
conditions. On the down side, Palm (PALM) disappointed investors. Boeing (NYSE:BA)  (           BA), too, might feel 
the heat after negotiations to buy 200 planes with Ryanair (RYAAY) broke off.
Overseas,            Asian stock markets followed Wall Street lower Friday amid recovery concerns. Japan's central 
bank            held its key interest rate unchanged at 0.1%, as expected, to support a recovery in the world's No. 2 
economy. Further, the bank said it was crucial for the country to beat deflation. 
           European indexes, on the other hand, rose. In            Germany, a survey showed that business confidence 
increased for a ninth consecutive month in December as Europe's biggest economy continues to recover steadily 
from its worst recession in decades. Meanwhile,            Greece faces its worst debt crisis in decades and its credit 
has been downgraded. Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou on Friday said the country's tax system 
will be overhauled by early March to broaden the tax base, boost revenues and fight tax evasion as part of efforts to 
pull the country out of an economic crisis.
In other markets,            oil prices rose above $73 a barrel Friday amid expectations OPEC plans to leave 
production levels unchanged at its meeting next week, as it has so far signaled. Traders are also looking for 
evidence demand for crude and its products is improving. The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen and euro 
Friday afternoon in Asia, giving back some of the gains.
With no major economic news today, attention will also turn to the climate conference in Copenhagen to see if world 
leaders manage to            find common ground and rescue a deal yet.

 Flyglobespan, Scotland's biggest airline, has become the latest airline to go bust. The airline made the 
announcement yesterday, canceling all of its flights and firing all 800 of its employees.
The workers got a bad deal getting fired just before Christmas, but at least they get to suffer at home, unlike the 
more than 4,500 passengers left stranded in foreign countries. 
The company claims it's contacting everyone affected, but the BBC didn't have trouble finding passengers and even 
employees who hadn't heard anything official about the closure. One senior cabin crew member learned he lost his 
job through Facebook.
The UK            Civil Aviation Authority is working to repatriate 1,100 travelers who were stranded as part of a 
flyglobespan package holiday, but another 3,400 passengers who booked directly through            flyglobespan.com 
have to make their own way back. easyJet and Ryanair have offered cut-rate "rescue fares" and passengers should 
check their travel insurance to see if their repatriation is covered.
There's also a helpline at 0871 271 9000.
Last year            an Irish bookie gave Flyglobespan 5:1 odds at being the next airline to go under. Skyeurope, also 
at 5:1 odds, beat it out when it failed on August 31 of this year.

 It has been a very tough year for London - not only has it been rated as having the worst hotels in Europe, it also 
lost its spot as one of the most expensive (and profitable) in Europe. 
Of course, the people that benefit this most from this are people that don't live in the UK. Prices in London are so 
low, that many Europeans are turning to the British Capital for its cheap shopping opportunities. The combination of 
a weak Pound and ultra cheap airfare is sending 100's of planeloads of Europeans to London each day. 
With plane tickets being sold for as little as $1 (Thanks Ryanair!), it can be cheaper to fly to London, than to load up 
the car and drive to many traditional shopping destinations. The Dutch used to drive to German Christmas markets 
to do some shopping, but now many of them head to the nearest airport and spend the day walking up and down 
Oxford Street. 
Five years ago, one Pound would cost about one and a half Euros - at the current exchange rate, they are almost 
on parity with each other. Combine this with stores offering steep discounts, and you have a country that has 
become one big outlet mall. Items that cost EUR1500 in Europe, are selling for GBP450.

Everyone remember Lumexis?  Theyre the guys that showed me their new very light and kind of awesome inflight 
entertainment system that US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  tested awhile back.  Earlier this week, Lumexis announced 
that they had signed up their first customer, and Ive been trying to figure out who it is ever since.  Lets see if you 
guys have any ideas.  Heres what we know.
  That announcement said that they had œbeen awarded a large order for its FTTS?? (Fiber To The Screen??) 
Audio-Video-On-Demand, In-Flight Entertainment Systems for installation on the new customers fleet of 737-family 
aircraft.
 This new customer will have entertainment but will also use the system to œsupport in-seat purchases by travelers 
of an array of products and services. 
With this information, Runway Girl started a conversation trying to figure out who it might be.  Ive uncovered an 
additional piece of info that dramatically narrows the field.
I asked Lumexis for further detail, and while they wouldnt tell me much, they did say that œit is a full fleet 
installation.  Aha!  So it cant be an airline with just a large 737 fleet.  It has to be an airline with a large fleet made 
up only of 737s.  There are four possible suspects that come to mind.
  Southwest Alaska Ryanair Gol  
Of these three, I would say Southwest is least likely.  They dont offer an œarray of products and services to sell 
onboard, so that seems suspect unless its part of a massive change for them.  Gol is possible, I suppose, but I dont 
have a feeling either way.  Alaska and Ryanair, however, both would have good reason.
We know that Alaska likes to offer a good product onboard, and they arent shy about charging fees for things.  We 
also know that theyve been fighting Virgin America really hard, and this would help them get toward product parity.  
Which All-737 Airline Is Installing In-Seat Video?
They also have a growing long haul network and a significant Hawaii presence that cant use live television because 
its outside of the service area.  This would seem like a perfect solution.
On the other hand, nobody knows how to sell like Ryanair.  If this system could somehow let them increase their 
onboard sales, it might be a rock star for them.  They can, of course, charge for the entertainment itself, though 
when they tried to use portable units for sale before, it flopped and they removed them quickly.
Who else has a large 737-only fleet that could be in the running?  I eliminated WestJet already since they have 
LiveTV.  What am I missing?  Anyone else?
What say you?

What would Ryanair do without those gusts of hot air from Michael O'Leary? The company has been defined by 
cheap flights and the streams of absurdities uttered by its chief executive officer. Without O'Leary, Ryanair is 
nothing more than an uncomfortable seat for the price of a martini. Well, the big guy is planning to step down in two 
to three years, he said on Saturday. He's said this before, of course, so we don't know when his exit will actually 
occur.
So, how does O'Leary plan to get out? He told RTE radio that he'd love to see Aer Lingus take over his airline. This 
final, masterful cut seems to be the elusive goal for the CEO. He's tried it twice and failed both times. But, does he 
really need it? The innovator has explored standing-room seating, pay to squirt and anything else that'll make a 
dime. He even came to the defense of an employee moonlighting as a porn star.
For the finance geeks, O'Leary's projected retirement date is pretty close to the end of a major capital investment 
program (in 2011), which is when he said he plans to pay some pretty hefty bonuses to the airline's management. 
At that point, he might also ditch his no-dividends policy.

 For once, Ryanair is in the news because of something unrelated to oddball fees or something silly their CEO said. 
Residents of the German village of Gro?? Grönau have pulled together to sue for Irish airline because they put an 
82 year old woman in the hospital.
Apparently, a Ryanair jet flew so low over her house, that it actually blew roofing tiles off the roof, putting the poor 
woman into a shock. One villager told the local paper that she actually had to duck when the plane came in for its 
landing at the local Lübeck-Blankensee airport.
A group of 500 anti-noise-pollution protesters accused the airline of negligent bodily harm and willful property 
damage. Of course, as is often the case with airlines, Ryanair is rejecting any responsibility for the incident.

Amidst considerable brouhaha, the market reacted positively to BAs long-delayed merger with Spains Iberia, on an 
effective 56%/44% basis. Not surprisingly, opposition to the merger has arisen, both from Virgin, who still recall BAs 
role in the grounding of Laker Airways, and from the loquacious Michael OLeary of Ryanair.
BA itself has many other challenges on its plate, ranging from the sharp plunge into losses, expected strikes and 
ongoing debate about its planned alliance with American Airlines. (NYSE:AMR)  However, its worsening pension 
deficit “ at an estimated £3 billion and above its current market value “ represent a real impediment to completion of 
the Iberia deal.
Prudently, Iberia included a get-out clause in its market statement ? ˜Iberia will be entitled to terminate the merger 
agreement if the outcome of the discussions between BA and its pension fund trustees is not, in Iberias reasonable 
opinion, satisfactory because it is materially detrimental to the economic premises of the proposed merger.
Despite the hours of legal time devoted to drawing up this convoluted sentence, it remains opaque. Clearly, though, 
Iberia could walk away. Moving to its asset base, BA inherited its key asset “ 41% of the slots at Heathrow, which 
drives its valuation. Without them, its core business class operations at Heathrow simply could not function.
Mindful of the £22.5 billion raised from the sale of 3G spectrum in 2000, could the Government not auction the very 
valuable slots at Heathrow, both to raise funds and to generate more competition?
Of course, BA would vigorously oppose such a policy even if were phased in over a deferred period. There are also 
highly complex legal issues relating to slot ownership both in the UK and in the EU.
British Airways “ Pension Deficit v Slots
But does “ and should - BA have effective ownership of over 40% of Heathrows slots sine die, unless it chooses to 
sell them?

The boss of AirAsia delivers his credo
TONY FERNANDES, the boss of AirAsia, a Malaysia-based budget airline, had tea with The Economist recently 
and came across as a thoroughly decent man. He told us why he started an airline in the aftermath of 9/11 and 
expounded the reasons for its success. Though he based his operational model on that of Ryanair, with a 25-
minute turnaround at airports, Mr Fernandes says AirAsia places greater emphasis on customer service.

   Nov. 16, 2009 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) --
Some views of the BA-Iberia merger
THE recently announced merger between British Airways and Iberia has given the metaphor writers a useful work-
out. Where my Economist colleague saw "two drowning men" that had "long eyed each other as potential means of 
mutual buoyancy", Ryanair spotted "two drunks trying to prop each other up.
The mergers outcome is generally expected to be positive. The belief that it will produce annual savings in the 
region of ??400m ($595m) within five years should put some pep into those drowning/drunk legs. But strikes by 
BA's cabin crew could cause short-term damage to the airline's traffic figures and longer-term damage to its 
reputation at a time when airlines are feeling particularly sensitive. Strike papers are being sent to cabin crew today 
to assess their views of new working practices that have frozen pay and reduced allowances. With the ballot closing 
on December 14th, and the consequent prospect of strikes around Christmas, who will book holiday flights with BA?
It's also interesting to consider what may happen at Heathrow as a result of the merger. Tom Otley of Business 
Traveller magazine wonders in the Daily Mail whether British passengers will suffer because of the lack of room for 
expansion at the airport, which is BA's base. With plans for a third Heathrow runway seemingly stalled, BA may 
choose to focus on Madrid instead. "[I]f this merger goes through," writes Mr Otley, "BA will have a second hub at 
Madrid, an airport which only in 2006 opened two new runways." It's not impossible, then, that Heathrow will lose 
some direct flights and BA passengers will find themselves having to take shuttle flights to Madrid for connections.

Extra fees charged by airlines, the "new normal," are so popular that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
has gotten into the game. And, bitching about these fees is equally popular, prompting the European Parliament to 
sound off like its members are Ryanair passengers with full bladders and no coin for the slot.
At issue is a planned $10 charge for Europeans coming to the United States. The European Parliament calls the 
charge unfair, saying it amounts to a new visa restriction. Enrst Strasser, a lawmaker from Austria, says that the 
requirements for entry under the Obama administration are even harder than they were under the previous (U.S.) 
government and that for us is a contradiction that we in the European Parliament cannot accept," Austrian 
lawmaker Ernst Strasser told Napolitano during a special hearing with her. "We really have to insist on our 
European values, that European data protection laws and European civil liberties also have to be taken account of."
Janet Napolitano, Homeland Security Secretary, calls the fee reasonable, since the United States doesn't have an 
agency for travel and tourism, "unlike many of your countries," she said of the European states. The $10 fee would 
be used to "fund and help tourists and travelers who wish to come to the United States." Since budgets are 
constrained at both federal and local levels, Napolitano feels this is a reasonable move.

 Back in June, a drunk Ryanair passenger started to freak out, and attempted to open the aircraft door in the middle 
of a flight from Riga to London. 
The man had finished an entire liter of vodka and a couple of beers, and it took two professional boxers to get him 
away from the door and pin him to the ground.
The plane ended up making an emergency landing in Sweden to dispose of their drunk cargo, which means it was 
up to a Swedish judge to sentence the drunkard. The judge handed him an 8 month sentence, and a substantial 
fine, payable to Ryanair. 
The man claims he can't remember any of the incident, and blames it all on his fear of flying. The Swedish 
prosecutor didn't buy it, and is actually appealing the sentence as he feels it is too light. Similar cases ended up 
with about 18 month sentences. 
The good news is that aircraft doors are virtually impossible to open midflight due to the pressure difference 
between the outside air and cabin.

Ryanair may start to look for its planes closer to home. Of course, saying it was thinking about a switch from Boeing 
to Airbus would be far too simple for CEO Michael O'Leary ... the genius behind "pay-to-pee" and many, many other 
stunts. O'Leary needs a bit more style, which is why his new intentions are being called "divorce."
O'Leary believes that the management shakeup at Boeing (NYSE:BA)  has taken the company's eye off the ball, 
which could be enough to make him switch teams. According to the Wall Street Journal, Ryanair is one of Boeing's 
largest clients and has been working an order for as many as 200 planes ... but the negotiations have been going 
on for more than a year. O'Leary says, "The difficulty has just been in getting someone in Boeing to make a 
decision. Boeing seem to have a degree of internal turmoil."
But, O'Leary has pulled this game before, and according to WSJ's The Source blog, he "is known to speak in the 
heat of the moment, use colorful language at press conferences to the amusement of journalists, and shoot from 
the hip." Yeah, like the time he referred to the idiots in the "blogsphere ..."

 The route was certainly circuitous but stocks ultimately staged a modest rebound from Fridays ugly action. Fords 
(F) $997 million profit hoard, a three year high in manufacturing, and pending home sales posting their eighth 
consecutive monthly increase all moved equities up. Revlon (REV), after rising 46.1% last week, was again a 
revelation and added another 19.4%; that the lipstick index lives was also evidenced in Estée Lauders (EL) 4.4% 
gain on an upgrade at UBS (NYSE:UBS). While women clearly continue to look their best, their men-friends may 
need to do more to disprove that chivalry is dead on dates if yesterdays 14.3% plunge in 1-800-Flowers.com

Nice Systems (-5.2%) turned in a decidedly nasty performance and Americas biggest dairy processor Dean Foods

 U.S. equities managed to recover some poise after Friday's plunge on-the-fact of CIT's bankruptcy confirmation, 
rumors of which had contributed to that slide, while Ford's better than expected earnings supported the bounce as 
well. The Dow is up 43-points, S&P climbed 5-points and NASDAQ is up 3-points in pre-open action. CIT's filing 
could result in a $2.3 bln loss for the Treasury's TARP, but Ford rallied 10% after beating forecasts. Ryanair warned 
it could split with Boeing over a large aircraft order. Human Genome Sciences jumped over 30% after citing 
progress on a Lupus drug. In M&A Denbury Resources struck a deal to purchase Encore for $3.2 bln. Goldman is 
proposing to by $mlns in tax credits of Fannie Mae, but could be blocked by the Treasury. ISM, construction and 
PHSI will vie for investor attention shortly. See Dow, S&P and Nasdaq.

You need to be a certain age to appreciate how Ryanair, which was featured recently on Panorama, has 
transformed British air travel “ and why many middle-age people believe Ryanair is one of the great commercial 
successes of recent times.
Back in the late 1970s, you faced a Hobsons Choice if you wished to visit Poland “ or indeed anywhere else behind 
the Iron Curtain. I can recall a standard £250 (late 1970 prices) return flight price being quoted from BA if you 
wished to fly to Warsaw - anywhere else, including Krakow, was off the menu.
Despite Panoramas focus on its ancillary costs, the reality remain that Ryanairs prices, especially for mid-week 
flights to its less popular European destinations, defy belief. Of course, Ryanair does levy additional costs to the 
basic airfare. Some of these are outside its control, notably the Governments APD (Air Passenger Duty) charges. 
Others can be readily avoided, notably the cost of transporting luggage in the hold. Is there really a need for a 
suitcase in the hold for a stay of a few days duration?
Ryanair has unquestionably changed Europes transport patterns. Flights to Eastern Europe, and to Western 
Europe, can often be bought at silly prices “ a scenario from which millions have benefited. Of course, you do not 
receive the high quality on-board service that might be offered by other far more expensive airlines. But Ryanairs 
punctuality record remains impressive.
There are many Ryanair obsessives, including this writer, who can only rejoice at the derisory airfares that Ryanair 
offers - often below £1 and well below the cost of a one-stop 300 metre tube ticket between Green Park and 
Piccadilly - to far-flung European destinations at off-peak times.
Ryanair “ The peoples carrier
Against that background - and assuming the maintenance of top-class safety standards - is any substantive 
complaint against Ryanair really valid?

   Oct. 14, 2009 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --
The European Union (EU) has generally done a decent job in pursuing European airline deregulation.  When 
European airline deregulation has been stymied, its generally been through the actions of individual European 
governments, often in Southern Europe, where, for some odd reason, airlines are viewed as a symbol of national 
virility.  Crankys done a good job of covering the machinations of the Italian govt to keep Alitalia flying, but he could 
have just as well picked on the French govt for its blatant subsidy of Air France in the early 1990s (which, trust me, 
the French govt would do again in a heartbeat, if it again became necessary) or the Greek govt for its support of 
various versions of the chronically loss-making Olympic Air/Airways/Airlines over the past 20-25 years (during this 
time, Olympic has been overtaken by private Greek carrier Aegean, though Olympic was itself finally sold to the 
private sector last month¦).  We should mention that the plucky Belgians, by contrast, let their late, unlamented flag 
carrier, Sabena, crater in 2001.  Yay Belgium.  Boo Italy.  Boo France.  Boo Greece.
However, with the downturn the EU has, unfortunately, come to the rescue of the traditional carriers.  And of 
course, the traditional carriers want even more.
Europes traditional carriers are represented by the AEA ” the Association of European Airlines ” which bills itself as 
the alleged œtrusted voice of European airline industry for over 50 years.  Yeah, like wed trust the fox with the 
henhouse.  The AEA is the rough equivalent of the US ATA ” the Air Transport Association.  The ATA represents 
the likes of American, United and JetBlue (that JetBlue pals around in the same trade association as American & 
United is another indication that notwithstanding its hip image, at heart JetBlue is the youngest legacy major). 
Similarly, the AEA represents dinosaurs such as British Airways, Air France, KLM (NYSE:AKH WS)  
(OOTC:AFLYY)  (which has a separate membership, despite being the same company as Air France), not to forget 
the ultimate European throwback, Alitalia.  European low cost carriers have their own organization, the ELFAA, 
which is where Ryanair and EasyJet, among others, hang out.
EU Reveals Unfortunate Preference for Legacy Carriers
So what has the EU done for the AEA and what does the AEA want it to do?
Many European airports, particularly the big main airports (e.g. London Heathrow, Frankfurt, etc) are slot controlled, 
and of course these are the airports where AEA airlines play.  EU rules say airlines have to use such slots 80% of 
the time or lose them.  That the traditional airlines have most of the slots (and the European low cost carriers dont) 
provides the traditional types with a degree of protection from the barbarians.  The barbarians are largely relegated 
to the alternative airports, despite which theyve done a great job of eating the AEAs intra-European lunch.
The problem is that in a downturn like this, the AEA carriers cant afford to keep using all their slots 80% of the time.  
So surely this means a breach in the city walls through which the barbarians can enter?
Oh, except that the EU has waived those rules to accommodate the AEA.  Life is tough, says the AEA, you should 
let us off the hook and let us keep our slots even if were not using them.  And the EU did just that.  City walls intact, 
barbarians largely remain mostly outside them.
This, of course, is pungent bull-merde (appellation controlee, no doubt).  Use-it-or-lose-it becomes meaningless if 
the moment the traditional airlines cant afford to use the slots, the EU allows them not to.  There are airlines in 
Europe doing just fine, they, unfortunately, just happen to be low-cost airlines.  God forbid they should somehow 
gain better access to the biggest airports.  Frankfurt might become overrun with airlines that dont (shock!) offer 
business class.  And where would we all be then?
Unfortunately, theres a precedent for such sordid and blatant protectionism on the part of the EU for the AEA.  It did 
exactly the same thing for the AEA after the airline downturn after 9/11.  Again, there were
 European carriers that continued to make money at the time, they just happened to be, from the point of view of the 
AEA, the *wrong* airlines.  Yeah, Ryanair and that rowdy bunch.
The EU should know better ” putting your finger on the scales of economic justice once just encourages the 
beneficiary to ask for more (just ask the Obama administration about all the favors theyre being asked to do for their 
Wall St pals after having pulled their undeserving chestnuts out of the fire).
In particular, now the AEA wants the EU to, get this, finance aircraft for its members. Yes, the AEA wants the 
European Investment Bank (EIB) to step in and provide credit to its members to purchase aircraft.  This, of course, 
is ridiculous.  If AEA members cant finance aircraft purchases, then said members should make do with what they 
have.  Period.  Again, its not as if aircraft finance is unavailable to all airlines ” its just that the financeable airlines 
happen to be the same barbarians (e.g. Ryanair) who dont offer business class on their flights.  If AEA members 
were profitable, chances are theyd be able to finance their aircraft.  That theyre not profitable suggests that they 
need to either shrink or die.  But going back to the issue of airlines as symbols of national virility, Seinfeld-style 
shrinkage is not something many European governments view with equanimity.
Unfortunately you have to imagine that such financing is, at the very least, a distinct possibility.  Many AEA orders 
are for aircraft made by¦ wait for it¦ Airbus.  So by financing AEA airlines, the EIB would also be helping out Airbus.  
We cannot rule out the EIB financing aircraft deliveries even to antediluvian specimens such as Alitalia.  Also, to be 
thoroughly cynical (but probably not totally wrong) if the barbarians end up killing too many AEA members, EU 
bureaucrats might have to travel with the great European unwashed (theres a cheap joke here, but Ill leave it be) on 
the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet.
The only silver lining to the gruesome prospect of the EIB financing aircraft for Alitalia is that it would provide 
Cranky with rant material for the foreseeable future.  I like Cranky, but that would be so not worth
 it.

Any Florida folks thinking of heading to Japan?
Pee first.
Japanese airline ANA thinks full bladders lead to airplanes being weighed down, so it's implementing a wacky new 
policy: pee before you fly, reports Fast Company.
           The airline is putting up signs at airport gates asking passengers to go to the bathroom.So-called "loo 
attendants" stand guard as well, asking potential pee-ers if they need to take a trip to the restroom, reports           
Fast Company.
They want bathrooms on the plane to be used for emergencies.
They're hoping to reduce the weight of the plane and lower fuel consumption and even fuel emissions.
So far this is a four-week trial.
But if the airline really wants to discourage passengers from peeing, it may want to take a hint from RyanAir's CEO, 
who recently proposed charging for bathroom use in the air.
We'd ask you if it's a good idea or not. But the damn spam attack means you can't talk to us.
And we're missing you terribly.

Remember Irish carrier Ryanair's idea of charging people to use their on-board lavatories?
The flip side of that might be All Nippon Airways. It began a one-month experiment Oct. 1 that it hopes will reduce 
weight on its airplanes and therefore reduce carbon emissions.
The Daily Mail reports that ANA "has announced that 'loo monitors' will be positioned by the boarding gates in 
terminals to ask waiting passengers to use the toilets before entering the aircraft."
From the Toronto Star:
 'Here's how it works: The average human bladder holds up to a litre of fluid, which weighs roughly one kilogram. All 
Nippon's most popular aircraft, a Boeing (NYSE:BA)  777, holds 247 people. So, in theory, if 247 passengers all go 
to the washroom before boarding, they could lighten the plane by up to 247 kilograms - the weight of three average

A thinking person would then question why airlines serve drinks on airplanes, since that would require visits to the 
rest room.
However, logic tells you that it's a zero sum outcome, isn't it?

I see that Harriet Harman, the UK's minister for women's affairs, thinks that Governor Schwarzenegger should close 
down the website PunterNet, which is based in California but posts reviews on UK prostitutes.
PunterNet must be delighted with this publicity. At least they are sensibly out of Ms Harman's grasp over in 
Sacramento. But the worrying thing about that is what she would say “ and do “ if the site were based in Britain. No 
doubt any website that offended her metropolitan middle-class sensibilities would be facing the axe. You can forget 
free speech when politicians have attitudes like that.
Ms Harman is already seeking to make it illegal to pay for sex, under the guise of preventing coercion (her 
legislative proposal talks about prostitutes 'controlled by another person' “ though not even the cops have much 
idea of what that 'controlled' is supposed to mean). And she praised a police raid on a Birmingham massage parlour 
which 'freed' nineteen 'trafficked women' (it did nothing of the sort: it just nicked women who had come freely, if not 
always legally, from Eastern Europe to work in a wealthier country).
Now where people are sold into any trade against their will, we should move to stop it. But the small number of such 
cases are no reason to squeeze prostitutes out of a living because Ms Harman considers the activity immoral. Yes, 
prostitutes travel “ it used to be to the next town, now, thanks to Ryanair, its the next country “ to go where the 
money is better, and to protect their future employability (as Gary Becker puts it, their human capital) against tut-
tutting neighbours and relatives. But where prostitution is a voluntary bargain, why should the state intervene? 
There may be issues of public health, but those are better fixed when prostitution is out in the open, than when it is 
forced underground.
The excellent book Prohibitions from the Institute of Economic Affairs points out that prostitution should, properly, 
be regarded as a caring profession, like nursing. There are many people who, for one reason or another, have no 
Harman and prostitution
sex partner. If that leads to a voluntary agreement to exchange sex for cash, then both parties benefit. Ms Harman 
objects that this is 'exploitation of women'. Well, I had a look at PunterNet. Yes, I'm sure, in the shadowlands of 
prostitution today, the agencies take about half the fee. But even then, at anything up to £500 an hour, I'm pretty 
sure it's not the women who are being exploited.
Dr Butler's book            The Rotten State of Britain is now in paperback.

 Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair, has admitted in a television interview that one of the reasons he was 
campaigning for a "yes" vote in the Irish referendum was that the government was "incompetent". Yet he says, "I 
needed to persuade them to sell me Aer Lingus."
I think  we knew that, but it is good to have it confirmed.
O'Leary had in fact said that it would be undemocratic to make the Irish vote again on the treaty after it had been 
rejected last June. He has now spent ??500,000 (£460,000) on advertisements and free flights to support the "yes" 
camp. A better advertisement for voting "no" is hard to imagine.

Smokers who can't bear not to light up while in the air may make            Ryanair their new favorite airline!  In an 
attempt to woo the business of smokers, Ryanair announced that they are launching a new line of smokeless 
cigarettes that will let passengers get their need nicotine fix without lighting up onboard.
 The Similar Smokeless Cigarettes have the look and feel of a real cigarette, but have no flame, so they are a way 
around the smoking ban.  They'll deliver a small bit of nicotine through inhaling, satisfying the craving of smokers, 
but will not emit toxins to other passengers.  The faux-cigarettes will be sold onboard all Ryanair flights to those 
passengers over 18 years of age.  A package of 10 will cost ??6.
The new plan is being marketed to both smokers (you can smoke onboard) and non-smokers (no more grumpy 
passengers because they can't smoke).
What do you think of this new plan?  If you're a smoker, would it make you choose Ryanair over any other carrier?  
Or is price, schedule, and other factors more important?  And non-smokers, what do you think?
NOTE:  Smokeless Cigarettes have not yet been approved for use onboard US flights.

So you think airplane seating is tight now. You don't want to know just how much tighter those accommodations 
could become if a British design firm's proposal is implemented.
Design Q has proposed commuter-style seating with flip-down backless seats facing one another across narrow 
aisles as a way to fitting more passengers into short-haul planes.
The firm told London's Telegraph that the new seating plan could translate to 50 percent more passengers being 
carried on commuter flights.
The seating plan calls for flat, almost unpadded seats that flip down from the aircraft sidewalls. Passengers with 
seats near the plane's fuselage would face inward face-to-face with passengers who flip down seats in the center of 
the plane.
The two aisles would be too narrow with passengers seated to accommodate a beverage cart.
Design Q said the seats would save fuel-consuming weight and expense and allow passengers to exit more quickly 
because they would fold up.
The commuter-style seating isn't the only seating scheme rolled out this year to cut airlines costs. Irish discount 
carrier Ryanair reportedly considered having passengers stand for the duration of their flights held in place by 
lightweight framework.
Here's a drawing of Design Q's proposal:

Southwest introduces a priority-boarding scheme
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES has introduced a new boarding facility. For $10 per person per flight passengers can buy 
œ           Early Bird Check-In, which gives you your boarding position 36 hours before take-off and at least 12 hours 
before other passengers can check in online. Youll still board after            Business Select and            A-List 
passengers, but you should make it onto the plane in time to stow your carry-on luggage easily and avoid a middle 
seat.
Various issues raise their heads. Is this a fee? After all, Southwest claims to be to fees what Dracula is to crosses, 
and the carrier loudly trumpets the fact that it does not charge for checked baggage. (For what it's worth, Gulliver 
says it isn't, as Southwest is offering a new service that passengers can choose to pay for, rather than charging for 
something that used to be free.)
And what happens when one member of a travelling group pays for Early Bird Check-In and then tries to bag seats 
for their not-so-Early friends? Flight attendants may need to do some policing, although Gulliver has never spotted 
any such angst on easyJet or Ryanair.
The pricing question is interesting. Is $10 the right amount? If too many passengers buy Early Bird Check-In, its 
purpose is nullified”and Southwest is not imposing any limits. For comparison, Ryanair charges £3 ($5) for priority 
boarding, while easyJet's fees are at least twice that much. So will you Southwest flyers be scrabbling to part with 
your $10, or will you just sit back in the departure lounge and sneak onto the plane at the end?

One woman's battle to get on a plane
Gulliver            sang easyJets praises last month for its response to a priority-boarding kerfuffle. But a colleague 
was rather less impressed with the way the low-cost carrier treated her, a pregnant lady, on a recent trip. Heres her 
tale.  
I was thrown off a recent easyJet flight from London Luton to Berlin Schoenefeld five minutes before take-off. It 
wasnt for terrorist tendencies, drunken aggression or dodgy luggage. My offence was attempting to fly without a 
GPs permission slip when more than 27 weeks pregnant.
EasyJet is not alone in its extreme wariness of pregnant passengers”           British Airways,            Ryanair and       
     BMI have similar gremlins lurking in the fine print. But            Lufthansa and Air France are more relaxed and       
     Continental Airlines is downright reasonable: œWomen in any stage of pregnancy are accepted for 
transportation on Continental¦ boarding will only be denied if physical signs of labour are present.            United and       
     American Airlines dont get fussy until women are at least 36 weeks pregnant.
I was told by ground staff that, at 32 weeks, my pregnancy posed a health-and-safety risk on the 90-minute flight. I 
asked a few questions: do changes in cabin pressure cause the amniotic sac to explode? Does turbulence turn 
expectant mothers into dangerous projectiles? Does the non-stop            flogging of scratch cards, duty-free goods, 
scorching coffee and rubber paninis initiate premature labour in exasperated mums-to-be? My member of ground 
staff was not amused, but ignorant of obstetrics she lacked any reasonable counter-suggestions.
Clearly easyJets concern was not my health. After hearing that my pregnancy was not the woman's problem, I was 
declined assistance in finding my way back to the help desk from the gate. As another ground crew member put it: 
œIf youre so fit to fly, youre fit to get back up those stairs and find it yourself. In the end a Ryanair employee 
showed me the way.

 So the US had its first "CEO President" with George Bush and now the Thatcherite Conservatives want to confuse 
business and government. There's a reason why nobody talks about the "CEO President" these days because it 
was a failure. Government is government. Business is business. They're not the same nor are the goals the same.
Delivering minimal services and asking constituents to pay a premium for anything more is only fair if you have 
deep pockets. It's bad enough that big business maintains too much control over government but in the minds of 
the Thatcherites, regular people ought to be pushed aside even more. It sounds a lot like "compassionate 
conservatism" which was anything but compassionate. How could anyone possibly think this is a good idea?A 
leading Conservative council is using the business model of budget airlines, Ryanair and easyJet, to inspire a 
radical reform of public service provision which is being seen as a blueprint for Tory government.
The practices of the no-frills airlines, who charge customers extra for services which were once considered part of 
the standard fare, are being emulated by the London borough of Barnet as it embarks on "a relentless drive for 
efficiency". A spokesman for the council has unofficially dubbed the project "EasyCouncil".
Barnet wants householders to pay extra to jump the queue for planning consents, in the way budget airlines charge 
extra for priority boarding. And as budget airline passengers choose to spend their budget on either flying at 
peaktime or having an in-flight meal, recipients of adult social care in Barnet will choose to spend a limited budget 
on whether to have a cleaner or a respite carer or even a holiday to Eastbourne. Other examples of proposed 
reforms include reducing the size of waste bins to minimise the cost of council rubbish collections.
The proposals are being seen as an example of "new Conservatism" which is spreading among Tory-controlled 
boroughs. Observers believe "radical outriders" such as Barnet offer a glimpse of how a David Cameron 
government could overhaul public service provision in an era of heavy spending cuts.

 It is not only Ryanair that is playing the money game. The US multinational Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)  took out a full 
page ad in the Irish Times to promote a "yes" vote. Intel's move is designed to curry favour with the EU commission 
as it is currently facing a fine of over ??1 billion under EU anti-trust legislation.
The way the referendum rules have been stitched up is, of course, another scandal. While campaign groups must 
adhere to strict limits on donations, companies or individuals can spend as much as they like promoting their views. 
Vested interests from Ireland and abroad can therefore spend millions attempting to influence how Irish people vote 
on 2nd October.
The "colleagues" are pulling no punches on this one -- they are determined to have their treaty. When they finally 
get it, we are going to have to shoot them. Failing that, download this.

   Aug. 27, 2009 (EU Referendum delivered by Newstex) -- 
           According to            Euronews, Europe's biggest budget airline, Ryanair, has "climbed on board the 
campaign to give the Lisbon Treaty wings."
We are told that the airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary has "dismissed what he called a lot of mumbo-jumbo 
in it" -- whatever that means. But, for him, the "clincher" is concern over Ireland's economy. Presumably, he thinks 
that ratifying the treaty is going to make Ireland's economic woes evaporate.
 More detail, however, comes from the Irish Times which tells us that Ryanair is to spend ??500,000 on advertising 
and cheaper airline seats in its campaign for a Yes vote.
O'Leary says that "Ireland's (i.e., his airline's) future success depends on being at the heart of Europe and our 
membership of the euro." His company plans to spend ??200,000 on newspaper and internet advertising and 
posters, and ??300,000 on "deeply discounted seats", to emphasise that "the EU''s policy on lower air fares was 
one of the reasons for Ryanair's existence."
This is the man, of course, who in            October 2005 was telling us "We should shoot EU regulators...", an 
instruction with which we would be happy to comply.
But, when the chips are down, self-interest prevails and O'Leary has thrown in his lot with the "colleagues". But, of 
course, this has absolutely nothing to do with Ryanair's long-standing bid to take over Aer Lingus. It is thus a 
complete coincidence that the ailing airline is            softening its stance towards a possible deal with Ryanair, 
having already rejected two bids.
Another reason to dump Ryanair
Ryanair, in fact, is barred by EU takeover rules from making another bid for Aer Lingus until January but O'Leary's 
current enthusiasm for the project will surely do no harm when the EU commission comes to consider whether it 
approves the bid. Then, as they say, money talks.

Dismal weather, heaving airport
A COLLEAGUE            muses in this week's Economist about the British summer and what the poor weather has 
meant for British Airways and Ryanair.
As British Airways (BA), on July 31st, blamed low passenger numbers for a big first-quarter loss, Britons were 
unwittingly doing their best to help, rushing to get airborne and avoid the rain. Lastminute.com reported that 
overseas flight bookings had increased by 20% over seven days. The Association of British Travel Agents said its 
members were seeing similar increases. The surge seems to have caught Ryanair, surely Britons least-favourite 
budget airline, unaware. On August 1st only 11 check-in desks were open at Stansted airport to handle 255 flights. 
As a result more than 700 passengers missed their planes. In the confusion armed police had to protect the staff of 
Ryanair (or œRiot-air, as one passenger put it) and others from irate travellers.
More details of that particular mess are available here. Ryanair's usually garrulous boss, Michael O'Leary, has been 
rather quiet about it.

Prompted by a comment in Mick’s Ryanair post,  I’m putting up the news in case like me, you missed the death of 
that wonderfully versatile actor            Harry Towb.He was equally at home in Greek tragedy and the slapstick of A 
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum or a Sam McCready comedy. Reared in the now very small            
Jewish community in Belfast, the            Jewish Chroniclerecords that he was thought to be the only Jew ever to be 
born in Larne! The            Times full obitrecalls the tough days of war time and his launch with the legendary Hibbie 
Wilmot.  Years ago, I had a cheery green room encounter with Harry and taxed him with frightening the life out of 
me when a big plastic chair completely swallowed him up in a Doctor Who episode. It scared him too he replied. It 
was inspiring to know that as a man of 83 suffering from cancer, Harry played the blind prophet Tiresias in Owen 
McCafferty’s version of Sopocles’ Antigone at the Waterfront studio less than a year ago. Great to know that he 
experienced the actor?s itch to keep working until near the end.

Today we tried to check in for our Ryanair flights to Dublin on Wednesday. This used to be how you got you around 
their check in charges at the airport, but those girls who used to unashamedly impose that unforeseen charge of 
£/20 are now redundant. Its been compulsory since 21st May. All was fine until the site asked us for the details of 
our kids passports. Neither of them have had cause before, so neither of them have them. So now we have to get 
them passports in two working days or say goodbye to what had been well priced air tickets and buy new ones at a 
higher price (though Ryanair prices are no longer competitive), or lose the holiday. 
Were not the only ones whove been stung¦ They can actually offer good value, but you need a lawyerly friend to 
check the TOCs with a fine tooth comb every time you book. I almost always end up forking out more than I thought 
I had bargained with them. If you want to book them but want to minimise the risk, you can keep up with with their 
latest passenger crunching techniques at the            I Hate Ryanair blog

           Citi In $100 Million Pay Clash (WSJ)
 Andrew Hall, the top Phibro trader who (sometimes)            lives in a castle (it's his vacation home in Germany) is       
     still fighting hard to get the hundred mill owed to him for heading up the bank's energy trading unit which 
"occasionally accounts for a disproportionate chunk of Citigroup income." This obviously puts Vikram and Co in an 
awkward position, in the face of the whole being owned by the government situation, though it's not even like it's 
really up to them anyway. Comp Cop Feinberg will ultimately decide whether or not the ballet practicing Hall gets 
his money.

 Speaking of! Technically, Feinberg can't rip up anyone's contract, but he can apply pressure to their employer to do 
so, and, if that doesn't work, can do stuff like subtract whatever they're getting for a bonus from their base pay 
and/or next year's pay.

An in-flight loophole that could make you ï??5
           360travelguide.com shares a subtle way to recoup the online check-in fee that Ryanair makes you shell out. 
The low-cost airline allows passengers to pay for and receive change for in-flight items in either pounds or euros. 
The numerical amount is the same regardless of the currency, so a coffee is ??3 or £3. By paying for that coffee 
with a ??50 note (worth around £42) and requesting your change in pounds, you get £47. Hey presto, a profit of £5. 
It sounds unbelievable, but apparently does happen. Gulliver suspects that loophole may be closed rather quickly.

Remember this?
           
I posted about this in            April, 2006. The NYT article was titled            Ready for takeoff? Even if its standing 
room? Back then the airlines involved vigorously denied that they were considering doing away with seats.
Well, three years later, the story is baaack:
           Would You Stand on Short Flights if It Meant Cheaper Fares?
 According to Marketwatch.com: A spokesman for Ryanair, Stephen McNamara, said the airline is looking to 
replace traditional seats with œvertical ones, which on a typical flight would allow between 50 and 60 additional 
passengers.
The vertical seats
Oxymoron “ Dude, if vertical, its not a seat!
 sound like something you might find in an amusement park:
Im not amused
 Mr. McNamara said the airline envisages having the passengers supported and restrained,
Why does that bring to mind horror movies involving insane asylums?
 and not simply holding a rail,
The screaming, floating strap hangers wouldnt look so good to the rest of the passengers?
 so they could handle turbulence or an emergency landing safely, Steve Gelsi reports.
Or perhaps the airline wants you to be on the            misericord,
           
Fly standing, my a**, part 2
so you pray for mercy on your soul during a rough flight?
 Ryanair would need approval both from U.S. and European Union authorities, as well as Boeing (NYSE:BA) , 
which makes its aircraft. Mr. McNamara said it could take three years before they could even pilot the program, and 
then additional time to launch it.
Give the sadists enough time, and theyll push it through, possibly even with a governmental bailout.
The thing is, once an arline reduces travel room, it later becomes a trend to all the airlines. When air travel first 
started, passengers were treated well, which later became first class (which is disappearing, fast), and now were all 
sardines in coach.
BUT
Yes, it CAN get worse!
 Another controversial idea -“ charging for toilet use on flights “- is œstill under consideration, according to Mr. 
McNamara.
There you are, catapulted into the upper atmosphere in an aluminum tube and theyre charging you to use the toilet.
What other humiliation will they think of next? Dare I ask?
Speaking of billing, how about allowing passengers to bill airlines for every minute of delays, at the passengers 
hourly wage rate, chums?
 """"""""""""""""
 Ill be joining            Jane and other friends at            BlogHer09 later today. Blogging will take second place to 
socializing and fun.
           
No, we didnt have to stand through a flight to get here, perish the thought.

 The British, as a culture, have come a long way since swiping the Elgin Marbles from Greece. They still won't give 
them back, of course, but the British are nonetheless inscrutably accountable these days.
If their elected leaders so much as replace a broken water heater on the public dime, the papers are all over it. And 
people care, too.
So it should be no surprise that a British consumer watchdog group has done a survey of how much online booking 
errors are costing its airline passengers. Add up all those whoops moments -- "Bucharest" instead of "Budapest," 
wrong travel dates, misspelled passenger names -- and the airlines have raked in an untold fortune from change 
fees and re-bookings.
The group, the            Air Transport Users Council (AUC), is the official clearinghouse for complaints against the 
airlines, and it reports that it received more than 1,000 complaints in 2008-09. That was 41% higher than the year 
before.
A few issues are at play,            says the Times. One is the fact the airlines are always tweaking their Web sites, so 
customers are perpetually hazy about how forms are laid out and where the stumbling blocks and opt-outs lie. 
Being charged twice for the same airfare, whether by errant double-clicks or by poor webmastering, is another 
problem.
There's also the fact that we now are so used to booking stuff online, all day and every day, that we're simply not 
paying as close attention as we did when Web purchasing was a novelty. The more we book online, the more 
mistakes are made.
And if the airlines are making money off those mistakes, naturally it's going to take longer and more pressure to get 
them to correct them.
The AUC pointed out that airlines are charging $650 to $820 just to change a name on a reservation -- something 
that can be accomplished in just a few keystrokes.
It's similar over here:            $150 is a typical charge, and now that the TSA's            Secure Flight program is 
tightening the leeway in differences between the name on your ticket and the one on your identification, the airlines 
stand to make even more extra cash as passengers sweep up after mistakes.
Airlines making a mint off your booking errors
In Britain, the gaffes are compounded by the fact that many airlines, particularly the "low-cost" ones such as 
EasyJet and Ryanair, offer telephone assistance only through expensive, surcharged numbers that can cost $1 per 
minute to call.
But at least they have influential watchdog groups like the AUC on their side, and with its help, a few British carriers 
(including Virgin and Bmi) have elected to implement a 24-hour "cooling off" period after bookings are first made. 
That gives customers time to check, in the cool light of day, what they just bought, and to cancel or change without 
penalty if necessary.
The AUC also noted that British Airways has a good record of lenience for correcting booking blunders, even 
though nothing in its Terms and Conditions says it has to be.
So far, with the exception of extremely expensive fully refundable fares, that's not something the American airlines 
(NYSE:AMR)  are doing for their customers as a matter of course. Right now, we're mostly at the mercy of 
whichever phone operator we reach -- and even then, we may be charged a fee to use the phone for the re-
booking.
Until things change, if you have a few too many martoonis at 3 a.m. and book a flight to Vegas, well, you're going to 
Vegas, but it's the airline that will be cashing in.
Will the airlines in the United States give us a similar grace period after bookings so that we can catch and fix 
errors? Not without pressure.

The meaning of Ryanair's recent announcement
RYANAIR is cutting 40% of its capacity at Londons Stansted airport this winter. And its all the fault of the British 
government and BAA, the airport's owner. At least thats how Michael OLeary, the companys boss (or the "cunning 
leprechaun in its cockpit", if you read the Telegraph), is            portraying the situation:
"Ryanairs 40% capacity cutback at London Stansted shows just how much Gordon Browns £10 tourist tax and the 
BAA monopolys high airport charges are damaging London and UK tourism and the British economy generally."
This summer Ryanair is operating 40 planes from Stansted, and from October until March 2010 that figure will be 
24, which is indeed 40% less. But it is rather devious to describe the cut as such. After all most airlines fly fewer 
planes during off-peak months; its called supply and demand. A more sensible comparison, as BAA has been 
pointing out in its defence, is with the 28 planes Ryanair operated last winter. That 14% cut is enough, perhaps, to 
make Mr OLeary wince, but no great bombshell in straitened economic climes.
Of course, a 14% cut would not grab headlines. Far better for an airline that thrives on the spotlight to describe the 
move as a 40% drop, and wait for the figure to be repeated or pooh-poohed (either way, Ryanair earns column 
inches). The media obliges happily because Ryanair provides such good copy. Gulliver certainly pleads guilty.
Some commentators have been taking issue with Ryanairs anti-government posturing. Says David Prosser            
in the Independent:
There is a certain hypocrisy in Michael O'Leary blaming higher taxes and fees for his decision to cut Ryanair's 
capacity at Stansted this winter. If anyone knows about making a few bob from extra charges, it's this budget 
airline, and at least the Chancellor's plan to raise air passenger duty from £10 to £11 hasn't been obscured in a 
swath of small print.
But Ryanair's tactics show no sign of backfiring, and Mr O'Leary shows no sign of keeping mum. There's plenty of 
life in this story yet.

   Jul. 22, 2009 (Action Economics delivered by Newstex) --
 FX Action: GBP-USD has made a third attempt at 1.6385 support in Asian trading, after bouncing off that level 
twice on Tuesday. Currently at 1.6403, sterling remains heavy with the market eyeing the UK Telegraphreport that 
Barclays and RBS will need billions more in capital, and this is helping to weigh on sterling. The NIESR GDP 
forecasts released this session remained negative, with the NIESR forecasting that the UK            housingslump will 
continue until 2012 and warning on the rise in            publicborrowing, forecasting a rise to GBP121.6 bln by 
2013/14. Press reports continue to reflect an underlying weakness in the UK economy with a            YouGovsurvey 
showing restraint in spending, while            Ryanairpalns to freeze 40% of its planes this winter on flight cutbacks. 
Also noted is the            Timesreport that pubs are closing at a rate of 52 per week. A fall under 1.6385 risks a 
further decline to 1.6265. EUR-GBP is holding a tight range around 0.8644-51 so far this session. GBP-JPY has 
eased lower, finding support ahead of 153.00 but with risk for a further decline to 152.40/50.

Review by Loyd Eskildson
Anderson begins with short stories about how Monty Python greatly increased DVD sales by giving away shows on 
U-Tube (I can't figure out why this worked), jello sales took off only when recipes were given away free, and Gillette 
boosted sales by "giving away" the razor (similarly, H-P and its printers vs. ink). He then uses a supposedly Ryanair 
"free" pricing example that simply uses a number of since infamous other charges (eg. credit card, baggage 
checking, water - some of which have successfully been challenged in court) to make up the difference, proving 
nothing. Next comes an "example" of a bet between Paul Ehrich/Julian Simon on whether commodity prices would 
rise in the 1980s - they didn't, but since have risen considerably - regardless, I have no idea what that example 
proved either.
Yes, Google search is a block-buster application, in part because it's free to the searcher, but how do you build a 
general business model from that? (It's not even a novel pricing structure - eg. commercial radio and TV 
broadcasts, "starter" software and Internet access that entices potential users, magazine subscriptions sold at a 
discount from newsstand prices, free "get rich quick" seminars that aim to sell a longer version have been around 
for years. Worse yet, the "free" (discounted) magazine and newspaper model is rapidly collapsing, thanks to 
advertisers moving to the Internet.
Build a quality newspaper organization (eg. the NYT, Washington Post) and then give its content away on-line? It's 
not working, and we're in increasing danger of poor journalism driving out the good. What about Amazon's "free-
shipping" for orders over $25? That's about as "free" as a no-down, liar-loan mortgage - everyone knows the hidden 
costs involved. Yes, distribution costs are going down, but that isn't keeping book distributors from RAISING prices 
for e-books. (Point: Economics tells us to price according to VALUE and incremental net profit - NOT pure marginal 
costs as Anderson seems to think, even if they are zero.)
Anderson touts the steep decline in transistor costs as additional support for whatever he's trying to prove - Intel 
(NASDAQ:INTC)  will sell you two billion transistors for eleven hundred dollars--meaning that the cost of a single 
Book Review: Free By Chris Anderson
transistor is now about .000055 cents. So what! It costs Intel $1+ billion to build/update a fab plant - they're 
supposed to give the transistors away? Just what is Anderson's point?
Anderson is reportedly following his own insight by giving away the book in England with the hope that it leads to 
more speaking engagements. Again, however, economists would support that ONLY if the net revenue doing such 
was GREATER than charging for the book and speeches.
Somehow "Free" gets over to the billion-dollar+ valuation of the social-networking site "Facebook," purportedly 
demonstrating the value of giving their services away for free. On the other hand, I'm more inclined to see it a 
repeat example of dot.com mania in the late 1990s when anything Internet attracted huge valuations.
Interesting Sideline - The Virginia Quarterly Review 6/23/09) recently published several examples of verbatim 
content in Free taken from various Wikipedia articles. It also promises a review of the book in its Fall issue - that 
ought to be interesting.
Finally, many of today's societal problems are caused by "free" pricing of important externalities. Added smog, 
global warming, balance of payments, highway construction, obesity, and defense costs are examples vs. too-low 
gasoline taxes.

Irish exceptionalism wins through over the common travel area

The issues of British and Irish citizenship are for both sorts of Irish, nowadays largely symbolic and about identity, 
which they obssess about but which mystifies the English, who harp on the practical points . Until that is,  a threat 
was raised to the common travel area. 
 This was quietly lifted yesterday. It happened as the Commons staged a fascinating debate on the spider’s web of 
links between “these islands” in the final stages of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill . The particular Irish 
(north and south) interest in the Bill was to avoid the unique status in Britain of Irish people becoming downgraded 
more or less by accident because of new restrictions on foreign immigration. œBritish Unionists of course are 
Siamese twins with southern Irish passport holders because of the facts of geography. The Irish, note, are not 
regarded as foreign in the 1949 Act, passed when the Republic cut its last links with the Commonwealth. Since then 
, tightening up through the British Nationality Act and successive anti terrorism Acts have pulled away from British- 
Irish exceptionalism, while the GFA has pulled in the opposite direction, towards interchangeability of citizenship. 
Suddenly last year, the Common travel area came under threat. That threat remained until yesterday, when a 
requirement for passports be shown on entry to GB from Ireland was withdrawn. This of course was politically 
explosive because of the near-impossibility of distinguishing between Irish passport holders entering from the 
Republic and British and Irish passport holders entering from NI. It has taken quite a while for the penny to drop. In 
the end, Immigration Minister Phil Woolas’s announcement of the withdrawal of the passport requirement was a 
grand fanfare to introduce a modest theme.  Will the Republic now remove its requirement for British passports at 
Dublin airport etc? And theres just one other wee detail. From the Irish Times story. 
The Home Office in London has maintained: “There are no plans to introduce fixed controls on the land border 
between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland or on routes from the Crown dependencies to the United 
Kingdom.”
 But there never were any such plans. The plan was for            “checks, ” not fixed controls, on entry into NI and 
between Great Britain and the other island. However I say you’d still be advised to carry a passport from one island 
Irish exceptionalism wins through over the common travel area
to another and not just when Ryanair requires it, whether is bears the harp or the royal arms.  The earlier debate on 
citizenship itself is worth a            browse, starting with the speech by Andrew Mackinlay, MP for Thurrock in Essex 
and unofficially, for God and Ulster. (Scroll through the amendment details to reach Mackinlay)
The Home Office, and now the Ministry of Justice, have never really understood the complicated, but unique and 
extremely interesting, constitutional relationship between, and shared history of, the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Perhaps they should have understood it, however, because, 
after all, we are told that this legislation has emerged from a review by one of our former Attorneys-General. He was 
supposed to do an in-depth job, but this topic obviously never crossed his desk; it was not on the radar screen.
I actually raised this with Lord Goldsmith myself, but he reacted with that time honoured English blindness that has 
bedevilled our history and only gives way, if at all, when the crisis is reached. He thought it might be possible in GB 
to distinguish for the purpose of citizens privilege between Irish passport holders born and resident in NI from those 
born and resident in ROI. Only if you put averyone through a few hours worth of background checks, like an 
unfortunate stateless Somali.  I may have put him right on that one. But on the narrow point of Irish citizens born 
after 1949 wanting to be recognised as British as well, I’m afraid Mackinlay lost his largely symbolic point – for now.

Until fairly recently, I have been a fan of budget airlines, if only because they have enabled my family and friends to 
whizz around the skies of Europe seeing interesting places and keeping in touch with loved ones. (Until I make my 
millions and can afford a Learjet, this will probably not change). I prefer Easyjet to Ryanair in this - by a whisker - 
because the commutes from the airports that airline uses to wherever I want to go tend to be so long as to 
undermine some of the cost savings of using the airline. This is a marginal difference between the two airlines and 
other passengers might take a different view. So Easyjet gets the nod. But until now.
Yesterday, on a fairly routine flight out of Europe, I spotted something that made my jaw drop - although that may 
be my naivete here. A young, short woman - less than 5ft tall - was struggling to push her hand luggage item into 
the locker above her seat. The bag was not all that big or heavy. But the flight attendant, a 30-something young guy 
with a rather annoying tendency to giggle at the passangers and staff constantly, refused point blank to help her 
move the item. I think the line went something like this: "It is not my job to move your stuff. If you cannot move it, 
then it is too big for you and it goes into the hold."
Eventually I helped the lady put the bag, which was fairly light, into the locker. Now I have checked the regulations 
on the Easyjet website and I cannot see where it is stated that flight attendants are not supposed to help short 
people push their bags into a locker. In other words, a woman was refused help because she was short, as far as I 
can tell. My wife speculated that Easyjet staff do not get medical insurance as part of their pay package, so they 
have refused to do anything - such as lift bags - that might lead to a problem. That may be the reason.
I hate the whole litigation culture so I would not advise the person in question to have a go at Easyjet. And it is a 
hassle to spend more money to fly with an airline where the staff do not come close to treating their paying 
customers with an attitude hovering between fake bonhomie and outright contempt. And in these straightened 
times, we'll probably do the British thing, bear up and put up with it. But all the same, I was not impressed by the 
orange airline, and will be avoiding it in future if at all possible. In fact, when I head for France next month, I'm 
taking the ferry across the English Channel and then duelling it out wiith the motorists of the Fifth Republic.

weekly podcast called            In the Loop, and I was one of the guests for this weeks production.  I usually do 
interviews on the phone, but this time I went downtown to record in a radio booth where they record NPRs 
Marketplace.  That means you get to hear my voice in all its crystal-clear glory.
We talked about the latest fun with Ryanair, Wizz Airs busted promotion, and of course, United breaking guitars.  
Take a listen for yourself.  My piece starts at 18:30 if you want to skip ahead, but its a fun show thats worth listening 
to the whole way through.

 As newspapers die and take substantive news with them, the Internet is turning into a carnival of odd tidbits. The 
weirder or more alarming the story, the faster word flits from screen to screen.
This week, a prime nugget from the News of the Weird had to do with Spring Airlines, a fledgling Chinese carrier 
that is petitioning its government to allow passengers to fly standing up.
Having passengers stand up, the way they do on a subway or a bus, would stuff 50% more people into planes, 
reducing costs.
Ryanair, an Irish company that never saw a cheap publicity trick it didn't love, tried to act like it was inspired to 
consider a similar move. It might give a section of passengers barstools instead of proper chairs, envisioned its 
boss, Michael O'Leary, or it could even let people fly for free if they stood up -- paying the carrier's extravagant fees 
to take any luggage, of course.
It's funny to imagine that United or Delta (NYSE:DAL)  might make us start doing it, too, and that makes for an 
inflammatory e-mail forward, but Americans can relax.
You're not going to have to fly standing up anytime soon, and here is the simple reason: The Federal Aviation 
Administration requires that you sit on flights. It's in its Airworthiness Standards code, Title 14, 23.785. Don't take 
my word for it. Just            read the code yourself: "There must be a seat or berth for each occupant."
Since the airlines aren't about to lose precious floor space by granting us the dignity of berths (beds), that leaves 
seats, and since the FAA isn't about to alter its safety rules so the airlines can wring another few bucks out of us, 
that rules out standing.
Another stipulation that would seem to eliminate standing says that each passenger is assigned a restraint system 
that "must be designed to support occupants weighing at least 215 pounds." Your own two feet, then, don't count. 
Berths must also be "installed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the airplane." That means they can't be straight up 
and down, as a passenger-size stall would have to be.
Don't worry. You're not going to have to fly standing up
Although Airbus has been            trying for years to inaugurate legal standing-room flights in Asia -- apparently the 
only place where the jet manufacturer thinks the value of human comfort is low enough and the population density 
high enough -- but so far, no government has gone for it.
Spring Airlines' managers think that the idea may have wings in China at least, because it was that country's vice 
premier who suggested the idea to begin with. Even if it becomes a reality there, SRO flights won't be permitted to 
touch down outside of China unless its destination country endorsed that configuration, too.
No, for now the airlines are content to convey teeming swarms of passengers the old-fashioned way. They'll just 
reduce legroom to            kneecap-knocking intimacy and make the seats thinner than the crackers they no longer 
serve.

As everyone knows, flying these days is a fucking nightmare. But its about to get worse. Remember how I posted a 
few weeks ago that Ryanair, the Irish discount airline, was going to start charging passengers a dollar every time 
they went to the bathroom. Well theyve topped themselves now¦ They are considering offering            œStanding-
Room sections on their flights¦ Thats right, they are going to strip out some seats and make a space where 
passengers would be strapped in their standing stools, (whatever the fuck they are) at least for take-off and landing. 
According to a Ryanair douchenozzle¦ "This will apply only on our commuter flights, under one hour, 30 minutes," 
he said. "You won't be standing from Ireland to Africa." On the other hand, if they made the whole plane a bar and 
sold a shitload of Guinness, think how much money theyd make every time someone went for a pee. You have to 
love the fucking Irish.

Ryanair reveals record-breaking passenger numbers and controversial new plans
RYANAIR is enjoying a good summer. The low-cost airline carried 5.8m passengers in June, its            best-ever 
monthly total. That figure, which represents a year-on-year increase of 13%, was roughly double British Airways' 
number, which dropped 5% to 2.9m.
Since it can claim by one metric to be twice BA's size, Ryanair has wasted no time in assuming BA's old tag line of 
"the world's favourite airline". It may seem perverse to use the word "favourite" in connection with a company that 
attracts such widespread condemnation, but those who condemn Ryanair for the way it conducts its business still 
fly with it to save money (while resenting themselves for doing so).
Because everyone loves to hate Ryanair, its proposal to operate flights with passengers standing up to save room 
met with a predictably            furious response. Except, of course, passengers wont be standing. They will be sitting 
on a stool, and will be strapped in for take-off and landing. But that wouldnt make such a good headline.
Gulliver is a fan of Ryanair. Their services are cheap and aggressively marketed as such. If you want a pleasanter 
experience with better seats and food and a bigger luggage allowance, then pay more to fly with another carrier. 
Indeed BA has done            a lot of the calculations for you.
Ryanair makes myriad announcements about its cost-cutting ventures to keep itself in the public eye and to ensure 
its indelible association with the notion of cheap travel. It may never actually charge passengers to use the toilet or 
make them stand in planes, but suggesting as much drives home the message that no stone is left unturned in the 
effort to cut costs. Many Europeans know that if they want to control the price of a holiday or business trip, they 
should head to Ryanairs website. And, as the June figures show, their numbers are increasing.

You have to love the crazy cost cutters at Irish carrier Ryanair.
The company's CEO Michael O'Leary is something of a money-saving savant, having pioneered such innovations 
as charging for the lavatory, charging for luggage, and preventing employees from charging their cell phones at 
work (to save on electricity!).
But the result is that fares are dirt cheap, a couple dollars on some flights, so some people love it.
The latest proposed innovation: standing-room tickets in the cabin:
The Daily Mail reports:
The Irish air carrier plans to cut costs by making fliers perch on stools with seatbelts around their waists.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary has already held talks with US plane manufacturer Boeing (NYSE:BA)  about 
designing an aircraft with standing room.
Should the idea get the go-ahead from the Irish Aviation Authority, the airline plans to either order new jets or 
refurbish its existing fleet.
Ryanair estimates it would be able to pack in 30 per cent more passengers while slashing costs by 20 per cent.
Would you do it? We would. Sitting down in a chair sucks, and it makes your legs feel cramped. Better to be 
standing. Besides, flights inside Europe are rarely too long, so what's the worst it could be? If we could pay $15 for 
a standing-room flight to Boston, DC, or Chicago, we'd do that too.

Thanks to Chris downblog, it seems that Ryanair            are indeed looking at having standing areas on planes as 
predicted here last Friday:
Ryanair Holdings may offer free flights to passengers willing to stand up during flights of less than 90 minutes, Sky 
News reported, citing chief executive Michael O'Leary.
Ryanair is asking Boeing (NYSE:BA)  about converting planes or delivering a new fleet with a section of œvertical 
seating' that would allow passengers to stand or to sit on bar stools similar to those in trains' dining cars, Sky 
reported Mr O'Leary as saying in an interview.
Mr O'Leary said he got the idea from a similar concept that China's Spring Airlines is reportedly looking at, Sky 
News said, adding that the airline said any move would have to be approved by the Irish Aviation Authority.
I mean, assuming this isnt some sort of stunt or anything. I wouldnt get too excited about that ˜free thing, btw. Thatll 
only last until they get permission to strap people to the wings.

 In a move that would make even Ryanair's president jealous, China Springs Airline has been working on the details 
required to let passengers            stand, or sit on a barstool-like seat,in order to fit more people on its planes.
The relatively young airline is looking at retrofitting its current planes with the new standing-room-only seats to keep 
pace with the incredible demand it has experienced.
These barstool-type seats -- which would still feature a safety belt -- would allow Spring Airlines to cut costs 20% 
and carry 40% more passengers per flight. No details about the actual seats are available but I can only imagine 
that they will look similar to the seats on stand up roller coasters. Despite the futuristic look, many people, myself 
included, find this type of seat horribly uncomfortable.
China Springs airlines flies domestically to 23 airports in China and has already shown the barstool seating plans to 
Airbus, where they earned a safety seal of approval. The airline is also in talks with the Chinese government to earn 
its big thumbs up.
China Spring Airlines' president, Wang Zhenghua, is confident that the government will offer approval citing current 
vice premier Zhang Dejiang's opinion that, "for a lower price, passengers should be able to get on a plane like 
catching a bus, with no seat, no luggage consignment, no food, no water, but very convenient."
If the idea catches on in China it may only be a matter of time before it is imported to the States, much like cheap 
city-to-city bus travel used to be. With at least            one budget airline already offering $9 tickets, it will be 
interesting to see just how low airfare can go. I can hardly wait to enjoy my next transcontinental flight standing in 
between a guy who talks to himself and a lady who hasn't showered in a week. Wheels UP!

Its incredible to think about how the title of a post or article really sets the tone for a story.  For example, if you saw 
the recent Dow Jones article entitled œ           Ryanair To Ban Check-In Baggage And Airport Check-In, you might 
be surprised to know that its referencing the exact same piece of news that Im discussing here today.  The            
only difference?  I see some good in this idea while Dow Jones is clearly going for the sensational, eye-catching 
headline.
Now before we get into this, I should start by saying that I doubt itll actually happen.  Ryanair chief Michael OLeary 
loves to spout off about his dreams about the future of Ryanair, but that doesnt mean it will happen.  Were still 
waiting to see those pay lavs, right?  But I think OLearys head is in the right place here.
Yes, its true that OLeary wants to ban checked baggage.  Sounds like a bad plan if you like to bring a lot of stuff, 
but this wouldnt really prevent you from doing that.  Because while he wants to ditch checked baggage, hed be 
happy to let you carry on as much as you can drag to the plane.  Are you envisioning overhead bins and aisle 
packed to the gills with bags?  Well if they run out of room, theyll just start putting the bags in the belly, like they do 
today on regional jets that cant handle those rollerboards.
If you think about this from a cost savings perspective, it makes sense.  You really dont need ticket counters or any 
place to for customers to interact with you outside security in this scheme.  You also dont need the complicated 
luggage transport systems and baggage carts that currently fill the underbelly of every airport.  You then need fewer 
people working on the ramp as well, because youre making the passengers do the work instead.
For passengers, theyll have to drag their own luggage all the way to the plane, and Im pretty sure this will make 
security lines even more miserable, but if youre paying a penny for a flight, then youll probably just deal with it.  And 
just imagine - no more checked bag fees!  Not happy about schlepping all those bags through the airport?  Im sure 
Ryanair will offer you a pushcart . . . for a fee.
Despite all the decent possibilities of a system like this, I still dont think it will happen.  Why?  The government.  Any 
time a plan touches the security process, the government gets involved, and Im sure they wont like this idea at all.  
Oh, and all those carry-on restrictions mean that a lot of passengers who travel with things like guns and knives, not 
to mention liquids in large containers, will have to fly someone else.
Ryanair Wants To Let People Bring Unlimited Carry On Bags
Then theres the issue of weight and balance in the belly.  With carry-on bags, you wont know how much luggage 
youll have and how it should be spaced out in the aircraft until people board.  That will likely delay aircraft turn 
times, and it will make for a mess of a situation right before departure.
So I dont think well see this plan come to fruition, but there certainly are some merits to it.  At the very least, its a 
creative way to reduce costs, and this industry can certainly use more creativity.

Ryanair, the low-fare, low-cost Irish airline, wants to eliminate checked bags early next year, according to published 
reports.
The idea is that sometime in 2010, passengers will not longer hand their bags over at the airport to have someone 
else stow in the cargo holds. Instead, the passengers will carry the bags all the way to the airplane and toss them 
into the airplane belly themselves.
According to Web site ttglive.com:
 Under the baggage plans, travellers would be forced to put their bags through security themselves and either carry 
them on to the aircraft or leave them on the Tarmac next to the cargo hold - coach-style.
The plans were dependent on airports allowing the excess baggage through the terminals. 'At the moment the 
allowance is two bags, but it is not enforced,' he said.
O'Leary admitted the move would spell redundancies for hundred of baggage staff. But he added the strategy 
meant 'freedom' for passengers."
This all came out as a side thought by Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary on Tuesday as he was blasting the British 
government's 10-pound tax on passengers. O'Leary said Ryanair was freezing its growth at British airports in 
protest.
And, if you're keeping score, O'Leary still plans to charge passengers to use the airplane toilets as soon as Boeing 
(NYSE:BA)  can work out a door lock that can be opened with a credit card.

I never thought wed see the day where British Airways does something that Southwest should follow, but that day 
has come.  British Airways has            rolled out a value calculator on its website showing how much more BA 
includes in its fares than Ryanair or easyJet.  (Hat tip to            The Airline Blog)  I think this is smart, but it doesnt 
go far enough.  If Southwest were smart, it would consider building on this and doing something even bolder.
I could explain BAs value calculator in more detail, but why not just show you?  Heres a screenshot:
As you can see, the point here is to show you how much more it might cost to fly the other airlines and why you 
should include this consideration when you make your purchase decision.  For those people who actually see the 
value calculator, this is great, but how many will actually get to that point?
Sure, theres a big ad for it on the homepage, but its not directly in the booking path so plenty of people will miss it.  
And of course, there are the masses who dont book directly at BA.com that wont see this at all.  So yes, its a good 
and important start, but theres more that can be done.
Its funny because Southwest finds itself in a similar position.  It is competing against many other carriers in the US 
who charge you extra for nearly everything, just as you see here.  Its quite odd to think that you replace BA with 
Southwest and Ryanair with United or American for this to work.
But Southwest has something that BA doesnt.  The vast majority of Southwest travelers book at Southwest.com, so 
they have more eyeballs as a percent of total traffic that could see this.  Nearly everyone who flies in a Southwest 
market knows to go check Southwest.com first and then go elsewhere.
But what if Southwest actually turned this on its head and started trying to attract even more traffic to its site?  
Southwest should start an online travel agent.
It sounds crazy, I know, but think about it.  You cant get Southwest fares on any other consumer site, so you have 
to go to at least two sites if youre looking to compare.  Now what if Southwest built an online travel agent that 
showed you all the other airlines side-by-side with their own fares?
British Airways Builds Fee Comparison and Southwest Should Take It Further
This would be an instant hit, because Southwest could become the only single site where a traveler could compare 
all airlines.  Now, other airlines might pull out, but Southwest could potentially look to backfill other airline flights 
from an established online travel agent.  It would make it harder for an airline to pull out of a site that already 
delivers it substantial traffic.
Heres where it gets interesting.  Southwest could build a better online travel agent interface that goes to their 
advantage.  They could incorporate all the fee information into the final display price so that they can accurately 
display the total cost to the customer.
In the past, Southwest may not have wanted to do this, because they had an aura of having low fares when in fact 
they often werent the lowest around.  But now if you include fees, they probably look lower much of the time.  This 
would be to their great advantage.
The best part for Southwest?  If someone decides to book on another carrier through the site, Southwest can still 
make some money off it in the form of a commission.  This can raise revenue for the airline, bring more people 
directly to its site, and provide an interface that will be of instant interest to much of the US.  And yes, it will highlight 
the true cost of traveling, something that should greatly benefit Southwest versus just a fare comparison.
You guys listening over there in Dallas?

 From the people who brought you            in-flight blow jobs (for pay in economy, for free in business), comes 
another outside the box idea. Bloomberg            reports that Ryanair will ban passengers from traveling with check-
in luggage. While you won't be able to bring anything that can't fit in an overhead compartment, it will be a relative 
free for all when it comes to carry-on bags, where the airline will apply no limit. For those of you worried about some 
asshole loading 12 bags of his own up top, do not fear. According to CEO Michael O'Leary the change, which will 
apparently save $28 million a year, will not mean "the end of civilization as we know it" and if you sufficiently bitch 
and moan about it enough, he'll probably throw in a BJ for free, regardless of your seat.

   Jun. 16, 2009 (Suddenly Frugal delivered by Newstex) -- 
While many Americans are talking about staycations this summer, the down economy has actually made it more 
affordable (if you have the money) to consider taking a trip overseas. Thats why this recent tipsheet from 
Airfarewatchdog, an airfare deal site that lists hand-picked low airfares from online travel agencies and airline sites, 
on booking airfare to Europe caught my eye.
œThere are five countries that are especially cheap to fly into from North America right now, Airfarewatchdog 
founder George Hobica says. They are Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Germany and Switzerland. And weve been finding 
non-stops from New York to Zurich for around $440 round-trip including tax, which is amazing!
Here are some highlights from 4 Timely Tips & Strategies for Buying Summer Airfare to Europe:
  Use a flexible date search on Orbitz, Cheaptickets or Hotwire. A fare from New York to Rome can be $500 with 
taxes on one set of dates in August, $800 on another set, and $1,000 on still another. Dont œblinder yourself into 
one set destination.  Get to know alternative airports, Ryanair (a super cheap airline in Europe), the rail system, and 
even cheap inter-city buses in Europe. For example, it may be cheaper to fly into Dublin and then grab a low-fare 
flight to your ultimate European destination in order to save money on the airfare. As far as alternate airports go, 
everyone knows Heathrow in London, and many are familiar with Gatwick. But Luton, which is about 40 minutes 
outside the city, often has the best rates for getting to and from Britains capital city. Check fares every day. 
International fares typically only change once a day, and they do change, sometimes by hundreds of dollars up or 
down. Sign up for all the alert systems like Airfarewatchdog, Yapta, Orbitz, Travelocity, Kayak, Farecast and 
Farecompare. Click over to the airlines site to double-check the fare. Once you find a fare you like using an online 
booking site, check the actual airline site to compare the fares. Many international airlines dont share their best 
deals with these online sties, consumers can save substantially by purchasing their tickets directly through the 
airlines site. But that works in reverse sometimes, too.  
Bon voyage!

Peter Preston, former Guardian editor and life-time student of Spin, gapes “ open mouthed” and the            antics of 
a Master.
“Sometimes, open-mouthed, you see a supreme spin doctor at work and gasp at his brilliance.
The more OLeary effs and blinds and introduces teeth-grindingly improbable charges – say, having to pay £5 
merely to check in for a flight or a £40 demand if you turn up a the airport without a pre-printed boarding pass – the 
more the travelling public seems to flock to his banner. It enjoys the humiliation of watching customers weep when 
their printers break down. It may even be attracted afresh by the prospect of passing wriggling hours awaiting a 
pee. Ryanair isnt always as cheap as it claims, but the nastiness makes it feel cheap (and not at all cheerful).”

   Jun. 4, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Michael O'Leary, the doofus head of ultra-cheap Irish airline Ryanair, is at it again.
He's trying to whip up cheap publicity by making light of his airline's dreadful penchant for microcharging its 
customers to death. On a TV show in Britain, he said, perhaps in jest, he was considering charging customers for 
barf bags. "Remind me not to be nauseous on one of your flights," the host quipped.
You may recall a few months ago when O'Leary drew bad blood in the press by saying he was trying to figure out a 
way to fit a            coin slot on the toilet door of all his airlines so that his passengers would have to pay to pee.
Following the resulting uproar, anger, and voodoo doll poking, he claimed he was only trying to get some            
cheap publicity, but the damage was done. His airline, Ryanair, now stood as a symbol for everything that's wrong 
in a corporate world gone crazy for petty fees.
He didn't learn his lesson, and now he's doing it again. Apparently, he thinks it's hysterical that his customers have 
to shoulder all his extra fees.
They're flying under the burden of luggage fees from $20 to more than $100, $40 fees for carrying            more than 
one carry-on (even if one's a bag of magazines bought at the airport), and $7.60 to print a ticket out, since it costs       
     $60 to get one at the airport.
Most of the American airlines (NYSE:AMR)  have learned to duplicate Ryanair's ideas as a way of shoring up heavy 
losses. And now -- tee-hee -- O'Leary wants to tease his customers again about being bled to death. Disdain for the 
customer is like a disease among some people in the business world. Behold the symptom.
Will he end up charging for vomit bags? The idea is absurd. It's too hard to implement. Nauseated passengers can 
hardly be relied upon to track down a flight attendant and conduct a transaction in the seconds before spewing. The 
Enough to make you puke: Ryanair considers charging for barf bags
fact is that it's a lot more expensive to clean someone's lunch out of the seat cracks than it is to give them a free 
waxed bag.
The real message here is that as the principles of microcharging sweep the business world, the men and women 
who run companies are being tempted into viewing customers as their pathetic playthings.
Ryanair, which just posted its            first-ever annual loss, may indeed be a pioneer of income techniques, but it 
may also eventually prove to be exploring new ways to irrevocably alienate its customer base.

   Jun. 4, 2009 (News Tribune delivered by Newstex) -- 
Chicago's United Airlines, which hasn't ordered a new jet since 2001, is back in the market for new aircraft.
The company has told both Boeing (NYSE:BA)  and its rival, Airbus, that it is looking for as many as 150 new 
planes to replace its aging fleet of widebodies and Boeing 757s.
United hopes that by shopping during the deepest recession since the Depression, it can negotiate attractive deals 
with the two major aircraft makers for what may be orders worth as much as $20 billion.
The average age of United's planes is 13 years, among the oldest among major airlines. Its rival, American Airlines 
(NYSE:AMR) , has an even older fleet at 16 years, but has committed to replacing its mainline standby, the 
McDonnell Douglas MD-80 with new Boeing 737-800s.
After the 2001 terrorist attacks that stunned the airline industry, Irish discount airline Ryanair, went shopping for a 
new fleet.
The prices it received from Boeing reportedly were substantially discounted.
Both Boeing and Airbus are having miserable order years.
Boeing, for instance, has net orders of zero this year. The company has had orders for 60 new planes, but has 
recorded an offsetting cancellation number of 60.

   Jun. 3, 2009 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) -- 
A few days in the life of Ryanair
TIMES must be bad for the worlds traditional airlines if the crowned heads of Europe are using low-cost carriers. 
The Queen of Spain (pictured) travelled in not-so-regal style at the weekend when she took a Ryanair flight from 
Santander to Stansted airport, near London. Apparently the ticket would have cost just £13 ($21). The Daily Mail       
     quoted a royal source who explained: "Whenever possible the royals use Spanish airlines, but in this case 
Ryanair was the best option for getting from Santander to London. It may well be first time the royals have used 
Ryanair."
By contrast, last year Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, and his wife Camilla hired a jet to go on an 
official visit to Uganda and Turkey at a cost of £316,061. Even Ryanair's excess-baggage fees struggle to get that 
high.  
If the transporting of royalty runs counter to most expectations of Ryanair, recent comments (not for the faint-
hearted) by Michael OLeary, the chief executive, play to type. He has reconfirmed his commitment to reducing the 
number of toilets on the carrier's planes and charging passengers to use them. As the Guardian quoted:
"We are serious about it," said O'Leary, who has acquired the nickname Michael O'Really within aviation circles for 
some of his more outlandish claims. He added: "We are flying aircraft on an average flight time of one hour around 
Europe. What the hell do we need three toilets for?" He denied that Ryanair was considering the ploy to make a 
profit from toilet breaks. "It's not because we need to generate money from the jacks. But ... if you get rid of two 
[toilets] you can get six seats on a 737. They will all be scurrying to the toilet before the departure gate."
Asked if he would be interested in charging £5 a toilet visit in order to eliminate the need for the loo altogether, he 
said: "If someone wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver."
The queen, the losses and the disappearing toilets
Mr OLeary mooted the idea of charging for toilet visits            in February (after which a spokesman said that his 
boss "makes a lot of this stuff up as he goes along"). He repeated the idea            in March. Why this latest salvo? 
Might it be an attempt to distract attention from Ryanair's recent results, announced on Tuesday, which revealed its       
     first annual loss, thanks mainly to a writedown of its stake in Aer Lingus? 
Whatever you think of the Irish carrier and its methods, it certainly keeps the airline world interesting.
UPDATE June 9th 2009: Ryanair has incurred the wrath of the Spanish royal family after using the queen's flight in 
an            advertising campaign. 
CORRECTION June 10th 2009: Those references to "O'Leary" and "O'Really" in the quotation from the Guardian 
were too much for Gulliver's addled brain and we referred to the boss of Ryanair as "Michael O'Reilly" in the third 
paragraph. This has now been corrected. Sorry.

   Jun. 2, 2009 (LawPundit delivered by Newstex) --
 UPDATE (June 4, 2009)
I received a full apology by phone today from CarTrawler for the car rental booking circumstances previously 
described in this blog posting, together with sincere assurance that the matter would be righted. As I was told, 
nearly everything that could go wrong, had gone wrong. A full refund was offered.
In addition - and among other things - CarTrawler indicated that its customer service would be improved to 
eliminate what were described as regrettable but unintentional - and correctable - technological mistakes, especially 
as regards improved company response to justified customer complaints and concerns. Moreover, the misleading 
excess insurance issue is to be corrected.
Additional suggestions for improvement were made.
If all of that occurs, CarTrawler will be back on the right track to becoming an honest and reliable booking partner 
for low-priced car rental.
__________________________
ORIGINAL but now UPDATED Posting (see above)
__________________________
I made the great mistake recently of following a CarTrawler.com (Dublin) online link at the            RyanAir (Dublin) 
website after booking a flight and hotel through the reputable and otherwise excellent cheap flyer            RyanAir. I 
also booked a hotel through a RyanAir link - with very good success at a reduced price - and then tried to rent a car 
at a flight destination airport, thinking that it would also be a good deal and not questioning its reliability since the 
link appeared on the RyanAir website. That was a mistake.
As we have discovered since then, CarTrawler is NOT a RyanAir affiliate and NOT a good deal. Do yourself a favor 
and AVOID CARTRAWLER like the plague. CarTrawler may cost you money and you may still get no rental car.
CarTrawler : An Alleged Car Rental Service to AVOID : CarTrawler is NOT a Full Car Rental Company and 
Potentially a Scam Costing YOUR money : Updated!
We have informed Ryan Air, the Irish Department of Justice and the Irish police, the Garda Siochana, about our 
case. Here is our experience.
CarTrawler is NOT a real car rental company - but this is not clear to the potential customer from CarTrawler's 
website pages. Rather, CarTrawler is a "booking engine", apparently owned by ETrawler which is apparently owned 
by Argus Automobiles of Dublin. This booking engine is used at its online website pages and those of its affiliates 
(ETrawler has over 40 website domains under various car rental names) and it uses virtually the same manner of 
advertising presentation as real car rental companies. It advertises rental cars with photos and specifications at 
what appear to be very affordable prices, but these are not THEIR cars. Look out.
After getting a car booking from an online customer, CarTrawler contacts "real" car rental companies and tries to 
obtain the booked car for the customer at the booked date and location - and of course at even cheaper conditions 
so that they can make a profit at the booked low price. If CarTrawler can not find a real car rental company willing to 
rent a booked car satisfying the low-priced conditions CarTrawler has advertised, the potential customer - as in our 
case - has a serious problem.
Here is what happened to us.
1. ALERT:Your credit card is IMMEDIATELY debited at the time of the initial "booking" even though this booking is 
not considered "binding" by CarTrawler, see point 2 below. To our mind, this is already fraudulent. Your credit card 
is debited even if the actual car rental date is far in the future. This is totally contrary to the usual and expected 
practice at established "real" car rental companies who actually have cars to rent and who debit the credit card after 
rental of the car.
CarTrawler DOES NOT inform the customer clearly online about this debit practice beforehand. You have to read 
the fine print of their "           booking conditions" and virtually no one does that and that is what such companies 
capitalize on to defraud their customers. We were certainly unaware of the practice at the time of our booking. Had 
we known of this debit practice, we would have left CarTrawler pages immediately. We in fact thought that 
CarTrawler was a real car rental company, given its online presentation. In our view that particular CarTrawler 
online presentation constitutes intentional "common law" fraud on the normal user.
One might in fact ask, how is it possible - legally - to debit a car rental in advance if the very car to be rented - at 
what may be an unknown price - is still being sought at the real car rental companies?
2. ALERT: If CarTrawler does not find the car that THEY advertised to the customer online at the advertised low 
"come-on" price at the date and location the customer wanted - as in our case, where we had booked a low-priced 
automatic shift - CarTrawler simply VOIDS the booking unilaterally. CarTrawler informs the customer that they do 
not regard the booking to be contractually binding until THEY accept it, that is, until they find the car as booked. You 
think you have booked a car - but you have not. To us, that is FRAUD and a view of contract that we do not find 
supported in contract law.
3. ALERT: You are - after the voiding of your booking - kept waiting for an allegedly "new booking" - and, we 
presume - more expensive booking - which may never occur. Here is what CarTrawler wrote to us one day after our 
booking and more than THREE WEEKS prior to the date for which we had booked a car:
"Thank you for your recent car rental request.
Unfortunately the vehicle you requested is not available with the selected supplier. We are however trying to place 
your request with an alternative supplier.
As your first choice is not available, the rental cost and vehicle type may vary from your original request . As 
availability reduces and popular locations sell out, we will offer you the best options available in the market. You will 
receive a new booking reference number shortly. Please disregard the old one as it is now void.

CarTrawler : An Alleged Car Rental Service to AVOID : CarTrawler is NOT a Full Car Rental Company and 
Potentially a Scam Costing YOUR money : Updated!
CarTrawler did not contact us again (in spite of our emails and ultimate phone call to them) - until FOUR WEEKS 
later, i.e. after the date on which we needed a rental car. Imagine then our surprise - several days after the 
CarTrawler voiding of our booking - to see that CarTrawler had already debited the non-existent rental car to our 
credit card account on the same day that they voided our booking! CarTrawler now had our money and we had no 
car.
4. All the while, by the way, CarTrawler is collecting interest on the car rental amount - i.e. on YOUR money - which 
has been debited to the customer's credit card in advance of any actual car rental. If CarTrawler voids the 
customer's booking and no "new" booking - as suggested or not to the customer by CarTrawler - is agreed to by the 
customer, it is then up to the customer to try to get their money back. Good luck.
We managed to get the money booked back to our credit card account at our bank - but only after more than two 
weeks, and only because we took the costly time to inform our credit card company of the fraud and demanded an 
immediate reversal of the credit card debit for a car rental which never took place.
But just think that if CarTrawler does this to thousands of customers, they are making very good money on the 
interest payments on YOUR money alone, without ever delivering a booked rental car at all. And what number of 
customers, through lack of time or insufficient knowledge, are unable to recoup their money at all?
5. THE EXCESS INSURANCE SCAM. Furthermore, if the customer makes the mistake of selecting the option of 
"excess insurance" (i.e. choosing to eliminate the car rental insurance deductible) at the time of their initial booking 
process, the customer surely thinks that this is part of their initial and single car rental booking, but - this is not so at 
all. CarTrawler treats the X that the customer puts in front of "excess insurance" option as a separate contract with 
a London outfit called            Insurance4carhire.com, a trading name of            Towergate Underwriting Group Ltd., 
whose main business is - you guessed it - the car rental excess insurance business.
The underwriter for  Insurance4carhire in the past has been            AIG, which recently had to be bailed out in the 
United States by the Federal Reserve to avoid creation of a global credit crisis. The non-profit            FBIC ranks 
AIG (NYSE:AIG)  eighth of all "bad-faith insurers" in its review of nearly 4,000 insurance companies. id="cite_ref-
10"            supWe do not know if that relationship with AIG has been retained down to the present time, but a clear 
picture begins to form of what is going on here.
Of course, as one might expect from the previous discussion, Insurance4carhire.com ALSO debits the customer's 
credit card IMMEDIATELY at the time of initial car rental booking, far in advance of any actual car hire.
Consider that debited money as gone. Here is why.
If CarTrawler VOIDS the initial booking,            Insurance4carhire.com, their insurance consort, still pockets the 
excess insurance premium since the excess insurance sold - this is all fixed in the fine print - is an insurance 
coverage of the "policy holder" and not of the specific "rental vehicle" for the period of time of the initial car booking. 
Here is what they write at their website:
"We insure the Policy Holder, not the rental vehicle. Excess is a voluntary insurance. Decline the car rental 
companys Excess cover at the counter when you collect the car. If the car is damaged or stolen, the car rental 
company will charge your credit card for the Excess amount and you then claim for reimbursement on your Policy."
As a result, even if CarTrawler voids a car booking - as in our case - there is still good money being earned via the 
excess insurance option. The excess insurance sold in this manner is difficult to recoup because it is not sold for a 
specific car vehicle but rather for a given person for a specific period of time.
Hence, after CarTrawler has voided a customer's car rental booking, that customer is still stuck with the excess 
insurance, in spite of the fact that he no longer has any car rental at CarTrawler at all. You can not easily claim the 
insurance payment back, since it is contracted to you as a person, and not for your car. We view that manner of 
insurance to be clear common law fraud. The customer is being clearly misled and others are pocketing "free 
money".
If that customer happens to rent a car from a real car rental company for the period provided in the excess 
insurance policy, the customer allegedly retains the excess insurance coverage.
CarTrawler : An Alleged Car Rental Service to AVOID : CarTrawler is NOT a Full Car Rental Company and 
Potentially a Scam Costing YOUR money : Updated!
But note this: if that rental car is - for example - stolen or damaged during the period of excess insurance, the 
conditions of contract of Insurance4carhire.com provide that the customer first has to pay the deductible to the 
actual car rental company and only THEN try to recoup that amount from Insurance4carhire.com. Good luck.
It might be interesting for those law officials in the UK and Ireland responsible for investigating fraud to examine 
whether any money has EVER been paid under this fraudulently-appearing insurance.
In our law school days we used to equate this kind of misleading interlocking business scam with a "criminal 
conspiracy", but perhaps the laws of Ireland and the UK accept this kind of business thievery as legal today. Who 
knows.
Just imagine this process being repeated thousands of times per year and you have a money-making "golden 
goose" that is laying golden eggs around the clock without actually ever renting out a single rental car, but rather 
merely profiting through the process of offering cars at very low prices to the public - prices which may or may not 
actually be realizable.
Money is earned not only if a car is actually delivered to the customer as booked, but money is also earned if NO 
car is or can be actually delivered to the customer for the advertised and booked price. We have even read that 
customers have been charged for cancelling a booking which CarTrawler does not even regard as a binding 
"booking" on its side of the contract.
It is a great racket for those who are profiting by it, and surely misleadingly fraudulent, at least from our 
understanding of the common law. And we have not heard the end of this case yet. Upon returning from overseas 
where we rented a vehicle at the airport from Hertz for a lower price than offered to us initially by CarTrawler, we 
found the following email from CarTrawler in our mailbox, as if they had never received our phone call or our emails 
to them:
"Our bank has informed us that you are disputing your car rental....
Can you provide us with information as to why this is being disputed?
Your information would be greatly appreciated so we can improve our service.
Thanks and Regards,
The CarTrawler Team

Fax: +353 01 4999661
Email:            creditcardquery@cartrawler.com
Website:            http://www.cartrawler.com"
Take a look at the CarTrawler "           booking conditions" here. Those absurd conditions will keep anyone who 
reads them from ever booking a rental car through CarTrawler or any of the affiliates or companies which use its 
"booking engine". Those conditions are designed to hoodwink the customer. Clear common law fraud.
Frankly, law enforcement agencies in Ireland and the United Kingdom should get to work to remove these kinds of 
fraudulently misleading companies from the Internet.
We are not the only ones to register Complaints about CarTrawler. Take a look at:
           TripAdvisor
           ConsumerAffairs.com
           ReviewCentre.com
The blog            Bleep.ie even received a "takedown" notice because of its publication of criticism of CarTrawler in a 
comment. The blog owner, Tom Raftery, in Sevilla, Spain, is thus far resisting this chilling action and if there were a 
blogging award for a Freedom of Speech Champion this year, Tom would be our selection.
Bloggers unite! If you or anyone you know have had any problems with CarTrawler or any of the affiliated 
companies of ETrawler or Argus, make sure that bloggers they know put the stories up on the Internet. We have the 
power to get rid of these kinds of companies.

   May 29, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Nobody enjoys sitting through other people's airline horror stories, so I'll just give a precis: I'm on a trip in Europe, 
and in the course of three days, Air France managed to strand me in both Paris and Tunis. I was thousands of miles 
from home with no way to get back. First it negated my reservation in the middle of a layover and next it completely 
lost a second set of reservations. The only way to solve both disasters was to throw money at the problem.
The extraordinary incompetence of Air France could fill a book, but I'm sure you have your own miserable story 
about your own airline of shame (United could fill a second book, if I thought its executives cared about reading it).
I actually wanted to remind Americans who travel abroad that, despite the extreme suckitude of Air France's human 
employees, its in-flight service is actually miles ahead of the American airlines. (NYSE:AMR)  In fact, when it comes 
time for you to fly abroad, you should make every effort to avoid the American-owned flyers and pick a European 
one. I'm not the only one to notice it; the Wall Street Journal recently devoted a story to the prevailing wisdom that 
the U.S. carriers offer paltry goodies. The WSJ was taking a business traveler's perspective. But foreign airlines' 
economy ticket experiences are simply better in most cases, too.
Many foreign-flagged airlines still offer complimentary wine or spirits on board. Even on short hops, carriers such as 
Lufthansa and, yes, Air France will still serve you wine on request. Air France even gives you a miniature bottle of 
your own. Not every airline is like this -- Scandinavia's SAS, for example, is no better than Ryanair, charging 
passengers ??3 ($4) for a drink of water. But in general, the major foreign carriers don't nickel and dime you at 
mealtimes.
Yesterday, I took a Lufthansa flight from Florence, Italy, to Munich, Germany, and the first thing all coach 
passengers received was a moist towelette -- it was real cloth, too. American carriers don't even give those to 
business-class passengers most of the time, let alone the pot o' noodles that Cathay Pacific will give you if you fly it 
to Asia.
Uncle Sam is a rotten co-pilot
Foreign carriers are also pretty likely to accept credit cards on board for times when they do charge for something. 
Flight attendants whip out a nifty little hand-held radio device that swipes your card and prints an instant receipt. 
That's the benefit of serving places with many currencies -- long ago, they started taking plastic to grease the 
marketplace, and they're ahead of the game. Meanwhile, some U.S. carriers are still living in the Cash Age. This is 
changing, but even as it does, many U.S. carriers still can't give you a receipt for the stuff they make you buy.
Foreign carriers are also likely to have seatback entertainment at every seat (which, by the way, typically recline 
less than our economy seats). I flew on United last year from New York to Tokyo, and for the whole flight, we had to 
watch the movie on screens at the front of the cabin. What is this? 1981? Virgin Atlantic, a British line, was one of 
the first carriers to kick off the in-seat entertainment systems way back in the mid-'90s, when some U.S. fleets still 
used planes that delivered audio programs through tubes.
One area in which foreign and national carriers are more or less even: Outlets for laptops. Air France had none on a 
recent flight to Paris, but American Airlines had them on a recent flight to London, provided I called up ahead of 
time to ask for a seat that was near one (the website            SeatGuru.comcan help you with that, too). Having my 
laptop was a real boon, particularly because I wasn't about to pay $8 for a glass of wine.
On balance, you just get a lot more for your money with the foreign-flagged carriers. Just as you should never 
assume that a known quantity like Hilton or Sheraton will give you the best hotel room in town, the air carrier whose 
name you know may not always be the best for your dollar.

   May 27, 2009 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) -- 
A strangely successful marketing campaign
A DUTCH hotel that has earned a name for itself with an advertising campaign celebrating its awfulness            has 
brought out a related book. The Hans Brinker in Amsterdam chirpily claims to be the worst hotel in the world, 
although Gulliver would love to see some accompanying evidence. A            video eco-tour refers to all the various 
absences (lift, spa, gym, attentive staff) that confirm the Hans Brinker's accidental environmental credentials. And 
slogans such as "It can't get any worse. But we'll do our best" encapsulate the hotel's attitude to self-promotion. 
This is all a pleasant antidote to the self-regard of most hotels. And the method has been successful enough for the 
Hans Brinker to pursue the theme for ten years. Still, wacky humour only takes you so far, and recent guests have 
not been too impressed if comments on TripAdvisor are anything to go by. (The gist is that the Hans Brinker is not 
very pleasant, but hey, it's cheap.) 
Shouting one's fault from the rooftops makes an interesting marketing ploy, and not one that the travel industry is 
familiar with. Still, we're all for a bit of honesty and Gulliver can think of several companies that might benefit from a 
similar campaign. Ryanair, anybody?

   May 27, 2009 (BusinessPundit delivered by Newstex) -- 
JetAmerica Airlines, a new low-cost carrier, is offering            limited $9 fares between select East Coast and 
Midwest cities starting July 13. The            St. Petersburg Times reports:
The tiny carrier will connect only small and mid-sized cities to the New York metro area and Minneapolis. This 
venture follows the no-frills, pay-as-you-go model of Irish powerhouse Ryanair and U.S. discounters Spirit Airlines 
and Allegiant Air. Fares will start at $9 each way for the first nine to 19 seats and top out at $199 one way.
Jet America will charge an additional $20 for a round-trip with an assigned seat, $20 to buy a ticket by phone and 
$10 to book on the Web site (www.jetamerica.com). The airline will begin with one leased jet and grow to four 
planes in a year, said chief executive John Weikle, former boss at now-defunct Skybus.
The four initial cities ” Toledo, Ohio, South Bend, Ind., Lansing, Mich., and Melbourne on Floridas east coast ” are 
subsidizing JetAmerica by waiving airport fees and helping with marketing and advertising.
Weikle is tenacious. Skybus, which failed last year, also had a similar business model to Ryanairs. Skybus, like 
JetAmerica, served small- to medium-sized cities. Skybus sold ten seats on each flight for $10“just like, you 
guessed it, JetAmerica. And Skybus Columbus, OH hub subsidized the airline to the tune of $57 million. 
Remember that Einstein quote, œthe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and 
expecting different results? JetAmerica has an almost identical business model to Skybus. Skybus folded after 10 
months, stricken to rising fuel costs and a slow economy. What will stop Jet America from failing, too? 
JetAmerica Airlines (Skybus II) Offers $9 Flights
I found one possible difference mentioned in a            USA Today article. Skybus owned its fleet, while JetAmerica 
will rent:
Weikle said in the statement that despite a deep recession and a double-digit drop in passenger traffic, now œis 
actually a good time for a start-up because airlines are cutting flights.
œJetAmericas plan is to fill the gap left by big, high-cost legacy airlines that have trimmed or eliminated services in 
many markets, he said.
Technically, however, JetAmerica is not an airline. It will sell tickets via the website            www.jetamerica.com, do 
the marketing and determine the flight schedule and cities it serves.
The company has contracted with Miami-based charter carrier Miami Air International to provide and operate the 
aircraft. Though flights will be scheduled, the JetAmerica operation will be classified as a public charter, not as a 
scheduled airline.
I question whether the new plan will work.

   May 25, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
Passenger annoyance has been on the rise over the past year, as airlines have found new and unusual fees to 
charge passengers. European low-cost carrier Ryanair (NASDAQ: 
RYAAY) has been at the tip of the spear, at one point considering a            charge for access to the lavatory. The 
hidden secret in all this is that it works.
Ryanair's latest fee is nothing short of brilliant. The airline is now            slapping customers with a ??10 ($14) 
charge for printing boarding passes at home... and ??40 ($55) to do so at the airport. Since there's no other way to 
get your boarding pass, this translates to a minimum fee of $14 per flight (with a few small exceptions). Given the 
company's price advantage in the short-haul European space, the move is unlikely to drive passengers to 
competitors. 
The effects of this decision are pretty easy to forecast, given the success that traditional airlines have had with other 
fees. In the United States, for example,            airlines picked up $1 billion in revenue from charging for baggage -- 
an amount that's likely reach $3.5 billion in 2009, according to Rick Seany, CEO of            Farecompare.com. While 
the conventional carriers battle for a commodity business where the difficult balance of prices, costs and fickle 
consumers make market wins difficult to secure, Ryanair's latest play doesn't jeopardize its spot in the low-cost 
world, effectively making the fee an unavoidable tax for cost-conscious travelers.

           Ryanair had no flights available from Derry to Glasgow, so I took the Belfast-Stranraer ferry instead. Just as 
well; I'm reading Malcolm Pryce's Aberystwyth Mon Amour, and this way I was safe in case Ryanair decided to 
charge passengers extra for carrying books with long Welsh names in the title.
I regard with affection any novel that begins: "The thing I remember most about it was walking the entire length of 
the Prom that morning and not seeing a Druid" and includes exchanges such as:
"`Is that Caldy Island?' she asked pointing at the map of Borneo.
"`No, it's Borneo.'"Had dinner in Glasgow with Donna Moore, a wonderful hostess who regretted that there was no 
dead body on the premises as there had been the day before; Allan Guthrie; and Ewan. Made plans to visit 
Edinburgh today, to which one Glaswegian replied: "You should have a lovely day as long as you don't have to 
mingle with the people."
Cheers,
Peter

   May 22, 2009 (The Economist delivered by Newstex) -- 
British Airways announces massive losses
BRITISH AIRWAYS (BA) will not look back on the past year with any great fondness. It has just announced a            
record pre-tax loss of £401m ($631m) for the year ending March 31st, a far cry from 2008s record profit of £922m.
The airlines explanation is fairly standard”high oil prices, falling passenger numbers, less cargo”but the PR disaster 
that was the opening of Heathrow airports Terminal 5 did not help much either. Things are not expected to improve 
any time soon. "The prolonged nature of the global downturn makes this the harshest trading environment we have 
ever faced," said Willie Walsh, the chief executive. "And, with no immediate improvement visible, market conditions 
remain challenging."
These results are vastly worse than BA predicted in November when it announced its half-yearly results. Then, Mr 
Walsh            said his company would make "a small operating profit" for the year, even though BA was already 
anticipating (correctly as it turned out) fuel expenditure of £3 billion. It seems the airline massively underestimated 
the effect the recession would have on its passenger numbers.  
Whats an airline to do in these circumstances? BA is desperately cutting costs, and has made 2,500 redundancies 
since last summer. But it remains hamstrung by its focus on the premium end of the passenger market, where the 
recession is having            the biggest impact. And it is not giving any signs of contemplating heading down market 
to compete more directly with the likes of Ryanair and easyJet.
"We are committed to being the leading global premium airline, commented Martin Broughton, the chairman. œThis 
year we will complete our Club World cabin upgrade and introduce a brand new First cabin while investing in 
premium cabin crew training to ensure that we can deliver service standards to match those experienced in the 
most prestigious hotels and restaurants.
401m problems for BA
Gulliver wonders whether that isnt a rather strange emphasis at a time when travel budgets are being slashed 
around the world. People are not deserting BAs premium cabins because the service isn't up to scratch. They”or 
their companies”just cant afford them.

           Much of            Brendan O'Carroll stand-up comedy act could probably not be repeated on a family blog, but 
he's accurate when it comes to accents; most Americans really do talk like that.
He's also dead on about Ryanair and the surreal results of its ultra-low fares and ultra-high, ultra-rigid service fees. 
(Ryanair is the airline that has recently contemplated charging passengers to use the lavatories on its flights.) The 
airline is such a figure of fun that O'Carroll got big laughs at the Millennium Forum in Derry with a mere allusion to 
an incident in which one of its pilots landed at the wrong airport.
The politics are pretty funny here, too, or should I say they provide rich material for comedy. I'd been impressed that 
Garbhan Downey could turn out that much fine political crime comedy in just a few years. After a chat with Downey 
today, I'm surprised the lazy so-and-so has not written three times as much.

   May 20, 2009 (CalorieLab delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Taking the old œIts better to look mahvelous than to feel mahvelous gag too seriously? 
Do American women associate being fit and slim with being healthy? Maybe not as much as one would think. An 
AP-iVillage survey of 1,000 adult women found that while some 60 percent of them are overweight or obese, only 
about half are dissatisfied with their weight and even fewer, only one third, are            unhappy about their physical 
condition, despite endless evidence that excess weight poses potential health problems. 
One might suggest that some of the overweight women are in denial, but even fit and slim females seem unclear on 
the trimness-healthiness connection. More than one-quarter of those with quite normal body mass index numbers 
are not satisfied with their perfectly healthy weight, and 16 percent are on some form of questionable weight-
reduction diet. 
In many cases, these diets fail to include fruits and vegetables, indicating that the dieters goal has less to do with 
increased health than with physical appearance. 
In fact, American women in general dont seem to be in any serious pursuit of good health. According to the survey, 
American females median amount of exercise per week (half get more exercise, half get less) is 80 minutes, barely 
more than half the 2.5 hours (150 minutes) considered the minimum to maintain good health. Nutritionally, a scant 8 
percent consume the recommended minimum five daily servings of fruit and veggies. 
Assuming that a study of American men would produce numbers strongly resembling these ” an assumption you 
can probably take to the bank ” it is reasonable to suggest that our national epidemic of excess weight is really just 
the most graphic symptom of an underlying health problem: that en masse, we still dont know and appreciate just 
what is healthy and what is not.
Women dont get weight-health connection, how thin passengers feel about heavier ones and the breakfast of 
exercisers
 Air travelers: Double wides should double pay 
And speaking of surveys, heres an interesting follow-up to an item in a recent Nibbles post by Sarah White 
recounting a Ryanair poll of its customers that found them believing the airline should charge extra fare for 
overweight passengers or require them to purchase a second seat. 
The airline declined these suggestions, citing slowed-down and inefficient check-in procedures. But, just for the 
record, those who fly Ryanair are not particularly mean spirited or resentful of the hefty flier: a survey of 7,032 
travelers conducted by TripAdvisor.com found a whopping 75 percent of them in favor of charging obese 
passengers for two seats.
 The Starbucks-and-Wheaties exercise formula 
Whats the best way to rev yourself up for a morning workout, dull the aches and pains that tend to result, and 
replenish the body quickly afterward? How about a cup of coffee or two and a bowl of cereal? A pair of studies 
indicate that a jolt of caffeine provides as much energy as a            high-calorie sugar rush, while cereal has the 
same            positive restorative qualities as a similarly high-calorie sports drink. Coffee and cereal: the low-cal 
exercise fuel. Who knew?
Here are the details. RunnersWorld.com has reported on several studies showing that a cup or two of coffee up 
front produces a boost in physical performance ” world-class athletes are known to caffeine-load before competing ” 
and now recent research at the University of Illinois reveals that it also produces a measurable lessening of post-
workout muscle pain. 
Even better, there is no buildup of caffeine tolerance, meaning the exerciser gets the same effect per cup every 
time. And fears of coffee dehydration are exaggerated; it takes just two or three cups to produce the positive 
effects, compared to approximately five cups before you run any dehydration risk. 
Meanwhile, a study at the University of Texas involving a dozen trained cyclists peddling for two hours at a 
moderate rate found that a bowl of whole-grain cereal with milk replenished the bodys glycogen, which refuels and 
repairs post-workout muscle, as well if not better than sports drinks, at lower cost and without the drinks empty 
calories. 
This bit of good news comes with a qualifier or two, however. First, the study was funded by the General Mills 
(NYSE:GIS)  Bell Institute of Health and Nutrition, the key words here being General Mills, as in œwe make a 
dizzying array of dry cereals and thus have a stake in the study results, and second, other studies indicate that you 
can also heal the flesh after exercising it with a nice glass of chocolate milk. Let your weight-watchers conscience 
be your guide.

more revenues from passengers.
The airline, which is phasing out check-in counters, has announced it will charge its passengers $7.50 for the 
privilege of printing out their boarding passes on their home computers.
If you don't have a printer at home or can't get access to one on the road to print your boarding pass, the airline will 
print one for you for $60.
This comes from an airline that is considering charging for restroom access aboard its planes.
The Irish carrier is also reportedly considering eliminating checked baggage entirely. Passengers would carry their 
bags through security and deposit them at the bottom of the stairs or in the passenger boarding tube where 
baggage handlers would stow them aboard.
The bags could be reclaimed at the bottom of the stairs or in the passenger boarding corridor when the plane 
reached its destination.
That's not unlike the system Horizon Air uses at Sea-Tac as an option for travelers who are in a hurry. The process 
is much simpler, however, with the smaller regional planes Horizon flies. 
The upside of Ryanair's charges is that the basic airfare is cheap. But the airline charges for everything else.

 It's microcharge gone too far. The European airline Ryanair is tearing out the check-in desks at 146 airports where 
it flies. As of October, if you want to check in for a Ryanair flight, you've got to do it in advance for £5 ($7.60) per 
flight, and if you forget, you'll be slapped with a hefty £40 ($61) "boarding card re-issue fee" per flight to get one 
from an employee at the airport.
Until now, no-frills Ryanair has been one of the most affordable European carriers thanks to its minuscule airfares, 
provided you knew how to sidestep its myriad of extra charges. Those include paying $30 to use a debit card to 
paying $40 to carry your airport shopping on board to paying $100 for checked baggage with a ridiculously low 33 
pounds. But this new set-up pretty much takes the airline off the map for American travelers.
Ryanair does not go across the Atlantic (although it has been            making rumbles about doing it), but it is the top 
low-cost carrier in Europe, and many Americans catch it while they're abroad. However, the inability to check in at 
the airport without paying £40 per flight is a burden on international travelers. Americans may have chosen Ryanair 
because they're doing Europe on the cheap, but there won't be many hostel guests who can find a printer for check-
in. This new rule favors business travelers with access to hotel business centers where a boarding pass can be 
printed. If you can't find a computer and printer from which to check in for Ryanair, you'll have to face that $61-per-
flight fee.
Add that to the welter of charges already being levied by the regrettable Ireland-based carrier, and Ryanair now 
stacks up as one of the most expensive airlines in Europe, not one of the cheapest.
Ryanair was supposed to be a model of the micropayment system, and an airline that could be of value to travelers 
as long as they could figure out, in advance, the way to navigate the added-priced perils. But now, having gone so 
far as to make too many of these extra fees unavoidable, it has priced itself back out of the budget market.
One flew over the Cuckoo's nest: Airline charges $60 for boarding passes
Instead, it's merely tricky and obnoxious, and it's now festering under a reputation as the airline that will figure out a 
way to bleed you dry if you're stupid enough to be seduced by its ultra-low lead-in pricing.

   May 15, 2009 (Slugger O'Toole delivered by Newstex) -- 
To give you the full flavour of the bitterness between the DUP and their prodigal, I post this ranting analysis from 
former DUP publicist Simon Hamilton. If Jim Allister had remained in the DUP would the party have caned him for 
his claims? Would he have behaved any differently? 
œUsing figures provided by Jim Allister on his own website, we can deduce that Jim Allister is costing the UK tax-
payer in excess of £285,000 per year.
œThe rank hypocrisy of someone like Jim Allister to go on radio and issue statements about other people’s 
expenses leaves a lot to be desired. Mr. Allister has serious questions to answer regarding his own expenses and 
how he is using public money. Using the average 2008 exchange rate, we can deduce he claimed in the region of 
£27,000 for travel and £23,000 for subsistence, including food and hotels. That’s a figure for one single year for one 
individual. This is the same man who was happy to go on the airwaves and lecture two individuals for their total 
claim for a period of four years. What a cheek! 
 Using figures provided by Jim Allister on his own website, we can deduce that Jim Allister is costing the UK tax-
payer in excess of £285,000 per year. 
During the last year Mr. Allister claimed:
          Salary:                                            £63,504.71
          Staff:                                              £144,975.00
          Offices:                                            £26,407.07
Civil war over Jims MEP expenses
Allowing for the 2008 average GBP to Euro exchange rate of 0.797, in one
year, Mr. Allister claimed approximately:  
Travel:                                            29 trips @ EUR1200 (£
956.40)    =                  £27,735.60*
Daily Allowance (Food and hotels):      103 days @ EUR287 (£228.74) 
=                    £23,560.12
EUR1200 = £956.40
EUR287 = £228.74
Taking the figures provided by Mr. Allister we arrive at a figure of
approximately: £286,182.50 for 2008
 Mr. Allister also indicated he had access to a £30,286 (EUR 38,000)
Communications Allowance but does not reveal on his website how much
of it he used last year

I normally deplore expletives but on this one, I can’t think of anything else to say. Why doesn’t that bombastic bully 
O’Leary stop inflicting            tortureon his customers, do the honest thing and just put up the fares? 
Ryanair is to start charging customers to check in online. The no-frills airline said that check-in for all its flights 
booked after May 20 would be by website only and that passengers must pay £5 to do so. Passengers without a 
printer must find access to one or pay a £40 charge for arriving at the airport without a boarding pass.

   May 13, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Americans like to think they have an appalling reputation in the outside world. We all know a few people who won't 
set foot on a plane because they fear some anti-American loony is bound to strike them dead on some foreign 
street. But it may surprise you to know that there are other nationalities that foreign hotel managers dread more.
To assemble the upcoming book The Titanic Awards: Celebrating The Dubious Achievements of Travel, tourists of 
all stripes are being asked to vote on the World's Worst in a variety of categories. Although voting is still going on, a 
few of the categories are revealing some surprising results when it comes to Americans and money.
Despite exchange rates that encourage us to be extra stingy, worldwide voters have so far not deigned to hand us 
the crown of "World's Cheapest Tourists." That honor falls to the British -- a head-turning result considering what 
their pound is worth.
Americans are currently taking the silver, followed by Australians and then the Germans. (My vote would be for 
South Africans, whose currency is so flaccid they're pretty much left out of the party attended by the rest of the 
Western world.)
Worst No-Frills Airline is no shocker. That title is currently held by RyanAir, the airline of the            death by a 
thousand microcharges and the recent            "pay to pee" fiasco. (Southwest and JetBlue aren't even on the 
boards, nor do they particularly deserve to be, considering the competition.)
But West Coasters might have something to say about Major Airport with Worst Shopping. The current leader is 
LAX. I don't agree with that one, because I always find a way to spend money when I head to LAX, but then again, I 
don't think the In-N-Out Burger by the runway counts toward an airport amenity.
Titanic Awards looking for world's cheapest tourists
The venture is a tongue-and-cheek effort to engage in a little casual consumer reporting. Only instead of critiquing 
the value of DVD players or washing machines, entire destinations are appraised by the people who have gone to 
them. For this survey, the word "worst" could mean a lot of things, and no one taking the survey has experience 
with every destination in the world, so you'll have to take the results with a chunk of salt.
But it will get people talking. The execs at Hilton and Super 8 will certainly be talking if their hotel brands are 
dubbed the worst upscale and budget brands, a distinction they are currently headed for.
The project is is brainchild of writer Doug Lansky, who previous compiled the Signspotting series of books of funny 
snapshots of signs (disclosure: he's interviewed me for this new project, too).
"There's this huge gap out there in travel writing," he told            National Geographic Traveler. "When you go on a 
trip, the story everyone wants to hear about is what went wrong; what's weird, wacky and crazy. But in travel 
writing, when you try to tell the dirt, it comes off as negative or whiny."
You can vote for your own worsts for the forthcoming humor book by taking the anonymous online survey, which 
includes some spaces for write-in nominations. I imagine the Hilton people will be casting some votes before they 
finish reading this page.

 Bursts of play as good as continuous activity 
A lot of kids get their physical activity in little spurts, and a study from the University of Exeter says            thats fine 
for their health. Researchers looked at 47 boys aged 8 to 10 and tracked their physical activity for a week as well as 
taking health measurements like weight, waist circumference and cardiovascular fitness tests. On a typical day less 
than 15 percent of the boys managed five bursts of moderate activity for five minutes straight and hardly any 
managed one bout of vigorous activity that lasted five minutes. But kids who had shorter exercise times throughout 
the day were just as healthy as those who spent more time being physical at a stretch, researchers said.
 Many LA schools dont meet junk food rules 
An audit of 70 schools at all grade levels in the Los Angeles Unified School District found that most schools violated 
healthy eating rules by offering foods and drinks that are supposed to be off-limits or letting food carts operate near 
schools that should not be there. Others didnt follow the rules when it came to selling food and drinks for 
fundraising by student and parent groups. Some administrators said they were unaware of the policies they were 
violating, and 18 of the schools didnt even have a copy of the policy on file. Sodas and other unhealthy beverages 
have been banned in LA schools since 2002, and food has been regulated since 2003. Eleven schools had vending 
machines carrying unapproved foods.
 Food manufacturers say their products a value 
More and more packaged food companies are playing up the            value of their products, promoting them as a 
cheap and easy way to get dinner on the table or treat yourself or your kids to an inexpensive snack. As more 
people dine out less, theres more of a market for eat at home foods, but theres also evidence people are skipping 
name brands for private label store brand products as they further tighten their belts. Companies say consumers 
get more for their money choosing their products, and in some cases thats actually true: Frito-Lay is temporarily 
adding 20 percent more product to chip bags without raising prices. If nothing else, all those new ad campaigns are 
bolstering one sector of the economy.
Nibbles: Sporadic activity, the rise of cheap food and no fat tax at Ryanair
 Is food getting more dangerous? 
With all the high-profile food-borne illness outbreaks in recent months, you might be wondering if food is            
getting more dangerous. Experts say food is definitely better than it was in the days before plumbing, and there are 
lower rates of illnesses from a lot of different pathogens that used to be more widespread. One big issue is that its 
easier to track outbreaks these days so more people are being reported as falling ill who might not have been 
counted before. The complexity of the food supply also means that one bad factory (as with peanuts) or a bad 
bunch of greens mixed into a bunch of salad in a sack products has the potential to make a lot more people sick 
than in the days of more localized food production.
 Ryanair says it wont charge by weight 
Finally, if youre not from Europe you might not have heard of            Ryanair, billed as the cheapest airline in the 
world, which as of this writing had flights starting at just £15. The company is all about no frills and charging extra 
for everything, but it says it wont start            charging heavy passengers more because to do so would slow down 
check-in procedures. The company used an online poll to ask customers how theyd like to change the airline, and 
the most popular suggestion was to charge extra for women over 220 pounds and men over 286 pounds. Second 
was the idea of having larger passengers buy a second seat if their waist touched both armrests. Other pricing 
schemes included a surcharge for each body mass index point above 40 or for waist measurements above 40 for 
women and 45 for men. The company says it wouldnt be able to keep its punctual reputation if such plans were put 
into place.

Ryanair CEO Michael OLeary, most recently criticized for claiming he would charge customers to use toilets on 
Ryanair flights, is todays swine flu FAIL award winner (the awards series, so far, holds promise). The UKs            
Times Online reports:
The outspoken head of the Irish budget airline Ryanair has dismissed apocalyptic warnings of a global swine flu 
pandemic, saying that the virus was only a risk to Asians and Mexicans œliving in slums.
Michael OLeary, who pioneered the 1p fares which transformed European aviation, told a press conference that he 
did not think the virus that is thought to have killed around 150 people in Mexico would wipe out his firms business 
this summer despite UN warnings of a pandemic.
œAre we going to die from swine flu? No. Are we in danger of SARS? No. Foot and mouth disease? No. Will it 
affect people flying short-haul flights around Europe this summer? Thankfully, no, Mr OLeary said.
He added: œIt is a tragedy only for people living ¦ in slums in Asia or Mexico. But will the honeymoon couple from 
Edinburgh die? No. A couple of Strepsils will do the job. 
A good spokesperson would also œdo the job for Mr. OLeary.

   Apr. 27, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 Bet you didn't see this coming. We all wondered what new fees the major airlines were going to institute next. 
Ryanair's gambit to have us pay to pee didn't go over too well, cutting off that avenue for now. So what do they do? 
Simply hike the fees they already charge. And do it right as summer travel clicks into high gear.
U.S. Airways, the most disrespectful airline in America, has announced its latest money grab: As of July 9, its 
baggage fee is going up $5. For each bag. For each flight. The new cost will be $20 for one bag and $30 for the 
second bag. Bring two bags on a round trip and you'll now be paying $100 above the cost of your ticket. (Bringing 
just one bag? That'll be $40 for the round trip, provided you only take two fights. Bringing three bags? Don't ask. 
That third alone will be $100 per flight.)
You'll have a loophole for escaping the new $5 tack-on: Check in to your flight online within 24 hours of departure. 
That means the current rates of            $15/$25 will become the "online pricing." Easy enough to do before leaving 
home, but not so easy when you're preparing to come home from a vacation. Just getting online for the day at many 
hotels will cost you another $15. Pay $15 to save $5? I don't think so.
U.S. Airways may be hateful (this is the airline that charged us $2 for water until the passenger revolt            forced 
it to recant), but there are plenty of travelers who are beholden to it, as it dominates their local airports.
Speaking of airlines that dominate their markets, Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK)  has decided to hop on the charge-
for-baggage bandwagon, slapping passengers with $15 per bag after July 7 (Southwest and JetBlue are pretty 
much alone among the biggies in refusing to join).
Both U.S. Airways and Alaska posted quarterly losses recently.
Pack light: Airlines raise baggage fees again, just in time for summer
Delta, too has decided to raise existing fees. As of July 1, if you're flying internationally and checking a second bag, 
that'll be $50 more each way.

Weve all sat in our seats on an aircraft before take off with the seat next to us empty. First we start hoping that no 
one sits there, then we hope that if someone must fill the space its not an excessive talker, or a noisy child, then our 
hope is vanquished. Down the aisle comes a 300lb lumbering hippo that is going to attempt to squeeze itself into 
the empty seat and in the process marry itself to you as well.  Into the seat they go and then the fountain of fat 
bursts forth and they spread themselves over you, enveloping your space and ensuring the next hours of your life 
are going to be excruciatingly uncomfortable. Why should we pay for this?
Airlines though are listening to the bulk of their customers, rather than their bulkier customers. United Airlines 
announced that it was seeking to charge obese passengers the cost of a second seat and Ryanair have            
revealed that over 30,000 voted in favour of charging overweight people a ˜fat tax when they fly. Those of the larger 
persuasion have to realise that space on an aircraft is at a premium and that paying for one seat when they 
comfortably fill two is sufficient for airlines to lose money whilst also causing discomfort to those next to them.
As the numbers of obese people steadily climbs airlines can no longer afford to treat them as single persons, while 
fair in principle the costs that they incur far outweighs the price they pay. Perhaps these extra costs will be a wake 
up call and change their eating behaviour. Or perhaps these costs will spark an entrepreneur into starting up 
Heavyweight Airlines or some similar named organization. The overweight though have to realise that, œobesity is 
always and everywhere an overeating phenomenon and that they are no longer in the same as weight class as the 
rest of us meagre morsels. (Apologies to Mr Friedman)

US Airways, the airline that brought its customers $2 on-board sodas, $1 coffee and blankets and pillows charges, 
has announced yet another inventive revenue-producing fee.
The Tempe, Ariz.,-based carrier today announced it will charge its passengers $5 to accept payment for checked 
bags at its counters. That's in addition to the $15 each-way charges for the first checked bag and $25 for the 
second.
Passengers can avoid the extra, extra charge by paying the bag fees online before arriving at the airport. The airline 
hopes to generate an additional $500 million this year from fees beyond the ticket charges.
The company dropped its soda and coffee charges March 1 because the fees put it at a competitive disadvantage 
to its rivals.
US Airways' latest fee is also part of an industry-wide attempt to cut costs by charging travelers who use costly 
services. Most airlines already charge extra for buying tickets by phone or at the airport counters. 
In Europe, Ireland's Ryanair, Europe's largest discount airline, is eliminating check-in counters entirely, requiring its 
customers to check-in from home on their computers or at automated kiosks at the airport.

Here in the US, most of our airlines are rolling out            WiFi Internet access to their entire fleet. For some reason, 
the European airlines seem more interested in bringing mobile phone access to their planes instead.
There are currently 27 planes out there with GSM mobile phone service, all part of a European Union trial. Last 
year, the EU granted permission for airlines to install the equipment, after extensive research into the safety of 
mobile signals in-flight. The service is installed on planes from bmi, TAP and Ryanair.
Personally, I think it is a horrible idea, and one I hope never reaches the US. I'm a huge fan of getting some work 
done during my flight, but to me that involves getting online, not talking gibberish to my "stock broker" or calling my 
family members and telling them how awesome the in-flight meal was.
Thankfully, the European airlines have put one very simple measure in place that will probably limit the amount of 
calls made during the flight - at just under $4 a minute, only the most insane or drunk passengers will spend any 
length of time on the phone.

Negotiators at American Airlines (NYSE:AMR)  today offered 5 percent annual pay raises, retroactive to April 1, 
2003, plus restoration of benefits taken away when the carrier negotiated concessions from its three major unions in 
early 2003.
However, leaders of the Allied Pilots Association, Association of Professional Flight Attendants and Transport 
Workers Union rejected the proposals, saying that such offers were unwise considering the current economic 
condition.
In a counter-offer made at a joint negotiation sessions, top executives at American offered to resign in exchange for 
a new labor contract. The unions, in response, urged the airline's board of directors to award stock options to keep 
the executives at the carrier.
Under the Railway Labor Act, American's contracts never expire but are amendable only on April 1.
In related news today:
¢ Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)  chairman-emeritus Herb Kelleher gave up smoking.
¢ US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  announced it would give $15 to every passenger who checked a bag.
¢ Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)  tried to squash AirTran (NYSE:AAI)  Airways like a bug.
¢ Northwest Airlines announced it was seceding from Delta Air Lines.
AA offers pay raises, restoration of benefits; unions turn offer down
¢ The last Eastern Air Lines flight finally got clearance to land at LaGuardia.
¢ Braniff VII filed for bankruptcy.
¢ Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK)  filed a lawsuit in Anchorage federal district court seeking $250 million in damages 
from Redoubt Volcano.
¢ Air France/KLM found a European carrier that it didn't want to buy.
¢ An airline industry analyst issued a report that did not include CASM, RASM, PRASM, ASM or RPM before going 
home ill.
¢ An investment group announced plans to launch a new carrier named Braniff VIII.
¢ Ryanair announced it was considering charging passengers to use a bathroom. (Oops, scratch that -- that one 
only sounds like an April Fool's Day joke.)
YES -- IT WAS ALL AN APRIL FOOL'S JOKE!

REMEMBER those warnings from a few years ago that holding a mobile phone against your ear for too long could 
cause cancer in your brain? Well it turned out mobiles were            safe enough to use on Ryanair- and now it turns 
out that they could, in fact, be the ultimate student oven. Queens University academic Professor Barra Ceide has 
managed to harnass the power of mobile phone batteries into a tool that could revolutionise how we eat 
convenience food forever. However, there are also fears that it would be be developed into a WMD for the 
republican movement. 
A new, free downloadable application now available on the internet allows mobile users to substantially increase 
their phone battery temperature and utilise microwave power¦ just enough to heat up pre-cooked supermarket 
meals and drinks using any smartphone with a flat touchscreen. 
For example, once the software is installed, users can place a cup of tea on top of a touch-screen phone (such as 
an iPhone) or beside any other brand with a half-decent battery, like a Blackberry Storm (see screenshots) - and 
the drink heats to an acceptable temperature using microwaves. The inventor calls the software hack, the ˜Ulster 
Fry...
Apart from the fact that the application uses microwaves and the screenshot is of a touch-sensitive ˜gas ring, it 
works exactly like a cheap household microwave. Just set a ceramic cup on your phone and hit enter.
According to the BBC, south Belfast student entrepreneur Mr Ceide said: œThis is just the first step in multi-
application mobile technology. At the moment, the combination of an overheated mobile phone battery and G3 
smartphone connection can only create enough heat to warm a cup of coffee or pre-heated microwave dinner, but 
the possibilities are endless.
The Ulster Fry on your mobile phone¦
œBecause its the first of its type and it was invented in Belfast, we decided to call the beta version the ˜Ulster Fry. 
Of course, it doesnt actually fry, as the software works on microwaves, but the commercial applications of such a 
brand would clearly strike a nerve with an American market.
œImagine being able to heat up a KFC or your post-pub ˜Rustlers microwave cheeseburger with a Nokia 
(NYSE:NOK)  cellphone running Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)  Android software. Think how useful that would be!
The application has been tested with some Samsung and Nokia models, but according to Ceile, works best with 
flat-screen mobiles.
He added: œThe software has a touchscreen interface and while ultimately it could heat up home-cooked meals, at 
the moment, the pressure of setting a mug or cup on a sensitive screen should activate the graphical ˜gas ring.
However, unionists are concerned that the application could be used by dissident republicans as a trigger for a hi-
tech bomb.
Said a security source: œAny device that heats up to a certain temperature is bound to attract the attention of 
dissident republicans, as it could be used as a simplified trigger for a bomb. Hopefully, this software will be seen as 
another idiotic attempt by some eejitto gain publicity for himself.

   Mar. 23, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
"Look, we all have standards," an adult entertainer familiar with the full- and part-time work of Ryanair flight 
attendant Edita Schindlerova told The Independent. "I think it's disgusting that she works for            Ryanair. All of 
us here at Biggus Dickus Productions feel really let down by her. If only she had told us she worked for them, 
maybe we could have done something to help her. Now, she has lost all our trust. Now, if you don't mind, I'm off to 
do a three way."
If you've seen Monty Python's The Life of Brian, you know not to treat "Biggus Dickus" as a joke name.
While many look down their noses at the porn business, it looks like the airlines are able to give even those in the 
skin biz someone over which to hold a sense of superiority. Of course, the            porn folks could learn a lesson in 
tolerance from Ryanair, which doesn't care about Edita's side job as "Edite Bente."
If you're surprised to see the porn industry claim any sort of moral high ground, don't be. Anyone who has spent a 
bit of time in this business has had to listen to more than a few hours of            First Amendment tirades, claims of 
wanting to be left alone and so on and so on and so on. Yes, it can get tedious, even though some of it is 
warranted. Either way, it's pretty crazy to see the porn industry piss all over the airline business. What happened to 
"live and let live"?Ryanair flight attendant Schindlerova was recently outed as a part-time porn star            by 
London tabloid The Sun. Her employer doesn't care, and she hasn't denied the allegations. She was also featured 
in the airline's 2009 calendar, a collection of the            sexiest employees that the            low-cost carrier has to 
offer.
Her cover was blown by a pilot who somehow stumbled upon her work. Either this was an incredible coincidence, or 
this guy, who has not had to see his name in the press, spends a hell of a lot of time cruising the web for porn.
Porn industry disgusted by flight attendant side job
Julia Molony,            who covered this story for The Independent, suggests, "Watch out fro the free-           orgasm-
with-every-flight offer on a billboard near you." Such naïveté ... does she really believe that Ryanair would give 
"free" anything?
Okay, through some investigative journalism on my part, I've been able to find some of her night job work.            
This is absolutely not safe for work or around children.This is not an adult website, rather it is a Czech tabloid, but 
do understand that they are able to push the envelope a lot farther than we can in the United States.
See our            first story on Schindlerova's erotic escapades.

   Mar. 22, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) -- 
 When the crew yells, "Brace!" one Ryanair flight attendant            probably looks for the cameras. London tabloid       
     The Sun (NSFW) alleges that flight attendant Edita Schindlerova (hopefully under a shorter name) moonlights in       
     porn - on video and the web. The sexy 22-year-old also makes an appearance in the            airline's 2009 
calendar.
The sultry stewardess wore a bikini and a smear of grease in the calendar, but this would be considered fully 
clothed at her second job. At night, she operates under the name "Edite Bente" and helps people part with their 
cash. Thanks to The Sun's investigative reporting, a tough job for some reporter, involves baring a pair of 34Bs.
The people she works for have apparently taken a more enlightened attitude than one would expect, saying, "What 
people do before or after they work for Ryanair, or when they're not working for us, is entirely their own business."
He adds a few remarks about putting the comfort and safety of passengers first (without editorializing) and makes a 
comment about employees being able what to do what they want on their own time, as long as their not breaking 
any laws. He could have stopped there and remained on the high road, but he had to keep talking: "All this proves 
is that the best-looking girls fly Ryanair."
Not everybody at            Ryanair, however, is on board with Edita's calling hobby. Her secret was discovered by a 
fellow Ryanair employee. Schindlerova claims, "I had this shit a year ago with a pilot with nothing better to do than 
check the internet."
A friend from work remarked, "We had no idea what she was up to in her spare time." This person astutely 
observed, "There can't be many airlines who have porn stars serving drinks on flights."
I guess this is the trade-off for having to            pay to use the lavatory on a flight ...

Aer Lingus trails far behind Irish rival Ryanair in the ability to create buzz, so sometimes it has to resort to desperate 
measures.
How else can someone explain a press release with the headline:
 Aer Lingus: 999 Nudes Bared Their No Hidden Extras 
You may have a different definition of "nude" than I do, but people wearning shamrock bikinis would not usually fall 
into that category, unless they were afflicted by a virulent forem of shamrock wilt.
In any case, Aer Lingus was promoting a 9.99-pound fare from London Gatwick, so it said it recruited 999 
volunteers via Facebook, Twitter and the like to parade in London. In return, the 999 got free round-trips for two 
from Gatwick to its new destinations from Gatwick like Vienna and Munich, Aer Lingus said.
Actually, there was nudity involved, says Enda Corneille, Aer Lingus corporate affairs director:
 "We had a police visit this morning where we were warned that if any of the participants were completely nude, 
they would be liable to a fine for 'indecent exposure'. However, once out of site of the cautious police, many of the 
participants ignored police warnings and stripped off for the bewildered, but eager, on-looking crowds, who 
captured the event on their camera phones." 
Thankfully, Aer Lingus made no such video available.

 Remember that little brouhaha that Ryanair stirred up a few days ago about pay toilets? (Also known as "The Most 
Ridiculous Thing I've Ever Heard.") Seems as though they're riding that train (or low-fare airline)...and seeing how 
far they can go.
The latest in their busy week of announcements: a competition. Yes, they're asking travelers to suggest other 
"ingenious, wacky, and creative ideas" for discretionary charges (if not pay toilets, which the company has admitted 
it was "only joking" about). Among the ideas listed as examples are charges for using the            oxygen masks and 
emergency exits.
Can I just say: thank goodness we're finally getting to the culmination of what's turned out to be a PR stunt...so we 
can potentially forget that it was suggested. After the past few years of charges so strange that you'd expect them 
to be fake, we wouldn't want airlines to get any crazy ideas, right?
But anybody wanting to play along can submit ideas for the contest by March 30th. ??1000 cash is the prize for the 
winning idea.

We'd forgive you if you accused us of being pro/anti Ryanair (depending on what you read).
In the past week we broke the news that the Ryanair CEO was considering introducing coin operated bathrooms on 
his flights. Then we
reported on remarks of a Ryanair spokesperson who claimed the esteemed Ryanair CEO            was just screwing 
with us. Thankfully the official reply is out - Ryanair will NOT be introducing coin operated bathrooms on their flights.
They will be credit card operated.
That's right, According to Ryanair, they have actually asked Boeing (NYSE:BA)  engineers to design a credit card 
operated lock that can be installed on the bathroom doors. That pretty much removes all concerns about not having 
enough change, or any worries about currency issues.
According to Ryanair, if 20% of their passengers use the bathroom on each flight, and they all pay 1 Pound for the 
right to pee or poo, they'll earn an additional 15 Million Pounds a year (21 Million Dollars).
As usual, there is something smelly about this plan - the extra income does not take into account the cost of 
installing the actual credit card operated doors, or the extra manpower required to transfer all these transactions to 
some kind of computer at the end of the day.
Nor do they seem to worry about the possibility that the equipment will break down, and sooner or later someone 
will break it when they can't get the damn thing to accept their hotel loyalty card as a valid method of payment.
Good news! Ryanair will NOT make you use coins to enter their bathrooms
We are already on our third installment of this silly idea, but I can't help feel we are being involved in a funny hoax 
by the airline. Either way, Mr O'Leary and his airline are clearly masterminds at creating free PR - almost getting 
themselves on the same level as that other brilliant airline PR guy, Richard Branson.
I just hope Ryanair understands what they are getting themselves in to - many of our commenters already said 
they'd rather take a dump in the vomit bag than pay the airline.

 Tentatively known by some as the "shit and pin" option, Michael O'Leary confirmed yesterday what many initially 
thought was only a dirty media smear: the latrine is now a payable "option". Alternatively passengers can opt to pay 
the "soiling" charge instead:
"We are serious...Most people would go to the loo (toilet) before they get on the plane, or they hold it until they land. 
You would only have to deal with the people who absolutely have to go" (link)
The announcement came, interestingly enough, as part of Mr O'Leary's presentation of a "rescue plan" for the Irish 
Tourist industry. Place your bets.
Although rumours of a Frequent Defaecator Club card programme are certainly false (maybe) some wags have 
suggested other innovative "cutting edge"' improvements to the Ryanair service are also currently easing their way 
through the management intestinal track and down towards the colon:

Last week, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the airline was thinking about charging passengers a pound, or 
about $1.41, to use the toilets on its airplanes.
That prompted a lot of potty jokes. But at a media briefing Thursday, O'Leary said he wasn't joking. As quoted by 
the Guardian, O'Leary expounded:
 "We have looked into this before and the problem is Boeing (NYSE:BA)  can't come up with a mechanism on the 
toilet door to take coins. We're suggesting they go back and look at a mechanism where you'd swipe the credit card 
for a quid on the toilet door. They've gone off to look at that." 
He estimated the charge could raise 15 million pounds, or about $21 million, a year. He also had this to say to 
critics:
 "All this pious stuff about if you're serving teas and snacks, you can't charge for entering the toilet. All right then, 
we'll charge you to exit the toilets and we'll let you enter free, but you'll have to pay a pound to get back out again."

   Mar. 4, 2009 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- 
A piece in the Wall Street Journal yesterday noted that            Spirit is planning to start charging a PUF, or 
Passenger Usage Fee, for anyone who doesnt book their tickets at the airport ticket counter.  Even though the 
author said it was coming in the future, it looks like they didnt waste any time, because its already out there.  The 
article makes it sound like this is a new invention, but Allegiant has been doing it for quite some time, as those who 
read            the comments on this blog would already know. . . .   
From the checks I did, it appears that this fee is $4.90 each way per person.  So, for a family of four traveling 
roundtrip, this could be a nice chunk of change.  The fee will be attached to any booking thats not made at the 
airport ticket counter.  This is the same scheme as the œconvenience fee that Allegiant tacks on to its tickets.  It 
makes no sense from a cost reduction standpoint so its frustrating.  But, it does make sense from a revenue 
standpoint - people arent going to go to the airport and wait in line for something like this.  And thats why this kind of 
fee will stick with carriers like this.
Its my understanding that they couldnt put this on every single itinerary.  Its actually not on flights to Colombia and 
Panama because its not allowed by the governments down there!  But the rest of you will get stuck with it unless 
you head on in to an airport to buy.
Its very interesting that the Journal article notes that Spirit had to come to terms with the feds on using the fee, 
because the first attempt to use it was considered deceptive.  I havent heard that Allegiant has had any trouble with 
it, so I assume that theyre being more upfront about it than Spirit here.  But the result is the same - another fee.
Those who know Spirit will not be surprised by this at all.  Its par for the course for an airline that wants to advertise 
extremely low fares and then pile on extra charges all around.  Its very much like Ryanair in that way, so just make 
Spirit Adds a PUF When You Buy a Ticket
sure that you understand how they operate when you decide to fly with them.  Assume theyll charge you for 
everything, and you wont face any unexpected surprises.  
My guess is that well see even more of these types of fees if they can get away with it.  Maybe theyll start charging 
a fee to use a jet bridge to board?  Or perhaps theyll charge a fee for not being subject to a body cavity search at 
security.  The opportunities are endless.

By Gary Stein 
 A year or two ago, this would have been shocking. Not now. Not the way airlines have been nickel-and-diming 
people to death.
 The latest gem comes from Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline. Word is Ryanair might start charging 
passengers for, ahem, using the toilet while flying. With a pay slot and everything. 
 I am not making this up. 
And you could almost tell it has been coming, particularly since various airlines already are charging some kind of 
fees for your first bag, second bag, pillows, drinks, headphones, phone reservations, seat selection ahead of time, 
you name it. And, of course, airfares were raised when fuel costs skyrocketed last year, but haven't been lowered 
with the drop in fuel costs.
The only real shocking thing concerning airlines was that the folks who landed in the Hudson River last month 
weren't charged $15 apiece for use of an emergency evacuation device, or maybe $20 bucks a pop for taking up 
space on the wing while waiting for help to arrive.
If and when Ryanair ever adopts the pay toilet policy - no word on whether customers will have to pay for toilet 
paper by the sheet - you can be sure that airlines in the U.S. will follow suit. It seems like the only thing the airlines 
don't charge for these days is air.
 Sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Don't want to give them any ideas. 
Customer service Ryanair is in the toilet.

OK, so the whole Ryanair paid bathroom thing was probably just a hoax by the Ryanair CEO, or another of his 
cheeky ways to create some free publicity for his low cost airline.
But it turns out that we here at Gadling were not the first to make fun of the concept of a paid airplane bathroom - 
Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK)  beat us to that way back in 1987 with this hilarious vintage commerical.
And is it just me, or does the passenger at 0:06 into this clip look like a young Andy Dick?

            The always-excellent cartoonist            Matt sums things up very nicely in today's            Daily Telegraph 
with this front-page cartoon.
In such a British tongue-in-cheek way, it captures the zeitgeist surrounding two highly topical and opinion-provoking 
events that have dominated the mainstream media during the past week.
One is pretty serious, the other looks as if it is but really, it isn't.
The serious story is the one surrounding ex-Royal Bank of Scotland CEO            Sir Fred Goodwin. It's been            
making headlines every day and prompting ever-stronger critical words from the Prime Minister and            other 
senior figures over Goodwin's £650,000 annual pension -- a situation that has prompted widespread expressions of 
disgust that the man who presided over            a bank that spectacularly failed, and which is a prime recipient of 
financial aid from the government, walks away from his failure with a legally- and contractually-binding pension pot 
that looks like a reward for that failure. Goodwin insists that            he will not give up a penny of his pension rights.
Does this man have no shame? Apparently not.
The second reference in Matt's cartoon is to            Ryanair and to reports this week that the Irish budget airline is 
considering            installing new coin-operated doors on its aircraft toilets.
Naturally it's led to some inevitable if not particularly witty headlines like "           Spend a pound to spend a penny" 
and leading to            other articles about the "bog-standard airline" being "flush with cash."
Capturing the zeitgeist
Whether the story is true or not or simply CEO            Michael O'Leary making it up, as a Ryanair PR disarmingly       
     describes it -- and if you            watch O'Leary in this BBC News interview (UK only), I reckon that taking the piss 
is exactly what he's doing -- I don't think I'd be surprised at anything from Ryanair considering the behaviour of 
some employees in this week's            other news about the airline and 'idiot bloggers'.
At least with stories like these, we get a sense that the world is generally ok if this is the type of news dominating 
the headlines.

Oh Ryanair, how you mock us.
Yesterday, every news source in the world (well, many of them) were abuzz with the news that Ryanair exec 
Michael O'Leary announced            he'd be introducing coin operated bathrooms on his planes.
Normally, when an airline owner announces something on the news, you take it seriously. Apparently that is no 
longer possible when it comes to stuff O'Leary says.
The latest update in the "paid bathroom concept" comes from a Ryanair spokesperson who's actual statement was:
"Maybe O'Leary was just taking the p*ss this morning. Michael makes a lot of this stuff up as he goes along and 
while this has been discussed internally there are no immediate plans to introduce it".
Someone might want to keep O'Leary away from the press for the time being, before you know it, he'll be saying 
something really stupid like that he wants his flight attendants giving free oral sex on his upcoming transatlantic 
flights.

would you like to            pay to use the bathroom? This is something that Ryanair (RYAAY) is considering for its

WHEN Irish blogger Jason Roe was booking his Ryanair flight to Cork for the            Irish Blog Awardsthe other 
day, little did he realise that his messing about on the airlines website would generate so much media interest. Roe 
initially thought hed found a way to get free flights, but later realised it was just a software glitch that made it appear 
as though he hadnt paid for his flight. But when he            blogged the bugand            mentioned it on Twitter, 
someone posting under the monicker ˜Ryanair Staff began to hurl abuse in the comments zone of Roes blog. 
Trolling? Well, the posters IP was traced back to Ryanairs HQ. The media found out, and the story has appeared 
everywhere from            the Irish Timesto            CNN and the Daily Telegraph. Ryanair remains unapologetic. 
Spokesman Stephen McNamara said: 
“Ryanair can confirm that a Ryanair staff member did engage in a blog discussion. It is Ryanair policy not to waste 
time and energy in corresponding with idiot bloggers and Ryanair can confirm that it wont be happening again. 
Lunatic bloggers can have the blogosphere all to themselves as our people are far too busy driving down the cost of 
air travel.”
 Funny enough, thats what Roe was doing when the whole thing started¦ Not sure the level of media attentionwas 
realy justified (some media outlets will pick up on anything to do with Ryanair, no matter how insignificant - perhaps 
just to get at OLeary), but I guess this amused/annoyed enough punters to make it worth blogging. Or perhaps 
Twitter/blogging are perceived as a popular fad by the MSM, who definitely dont understand the (in)significance of 
the content. Anyway, some nice publicity for Roe - and the rude people at Ryanair might like to bear in mind that 
when ˜Ryanair Staff was slagging off Roe for not being able to hack a free seat, he added: œThere is another 
exploit you could try - wait until we’re running a promotion when we give away a million odd seats for free anyway. 
Open season on the Ryanair site?

All the Ryanair buzz this morning is about some casual comments made by Michael OLeary suggesting he wants to       
     charge people to use the lav onboard.  Well of course he does.  Even if he is successful in this plot, its not nearly 
as big of a deal as the announcement earlier this week that            Ryanair will ditch ticket counters at airports to 
save money.  That could have much larger consequences for travelers than simply having to pay to pee.
This scheme certainly brings up plenty of questions.  First of all, how do you check a bag?  Fear not, there will still 
be a bag drop for the anticipated 1 in 5 people that need to check a bag, but thats about it.  I think the plan is to 
have people check their bags online, tag them, and then drop them off and be done with it.  You wont be able to do 
anything else until youre behind security, but the cost savings here may spur Ryanair to actually reduce the bag 
check fees.
There are undoubtedly going to be some major hiccups here in the short term as they settle into this new routine.  
Only 75% of people check in online now, so those remaining 25% will have to change their behavior or be out of 
luck.  The communication piece on this change is critical, and I imagine that Ryanairs best efforts wont be nearly 
enough to get 100% compliance.  
The good news is that you can check in online up to 14 days in advance.  So the excuse of not having internet 
access for two straight weeks before your flight seems highly unlikely.  But what if you happen to forget or you didnt 
read the fine print saying you have to check in at home?  Will you still be able to check in at the airport on a kiosk?  
Even if you can, what if you get stuck on a delayed train (if youre in London, thats just a given), and you miss your 
flight?  Can you still get through security with your expired boarding pass?  Or will you be stuck and out of luck?
There are plenty of scenarios like these that may happen infrequently, but they still will happen.  Over the first few 
months of this plan, Ryanair is going to have to learn about these corner cases, and its not going to be a pleasant 
Forget Charging for Lavs, Ryanair Is Eliminating Ticket Counters at Airports
learning experience for the passenger.  Of course, if you buy your ticket for a penny, youll suck it up and deal with 
it.  
Its basically going to be like a bus now, except theyll frisk you before you get to the door and you cant pay your fare 
onboard.  But like the bus, nobody will be around to help you figure things out beforehand.  Youll just have to be 
good at getting around on your own.  If you arent, well, Ryanair will probably tell you to fly someone else.  
Something tells me the cost savings will be worth it for them.

This from Bloomberg News:
"Ryanair Holdings, Europes biggest discount airline, may charge passengers to use toilets on its planes, adding to 
fees already imposed for beverages, stowed baggage, airport check-in and preferential boarding. 
"Ryanair generates about 20 percent of revenue from ancillary income, the money it makes aside from ticket sales. 
The Dublin-based company introduced technology this month allowing passengers to use mobile phones on 
aircraft.
 
"One thing weve looked at in the past and are looking at again is the possibility of maybe putting in a coin slot on 
the toilet door so that people might actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in the future, Chief Executive 
Michael OLeary said in a televised interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
 
"Ryanair raised its net income forecast on Dec. 2 for the year ending March 31 to 50 million euros ($63 million), 
saying the falling price of oil has more than compensated for the lower fares its offering to stave off a drop in traffic. 
Passenger numbers rose 11 percent in January from a year earlier.

"Stephen McNamara, a spokesman for the company, said there is no certainty that toilet charges will be imposed.
 
" œMichael makes a lot of this stuff up as he goes along, and while this has been discussed internally there are no 
immediate plans to introduce it, McNamara said.
 
" He added: œAncillary revenues...help to reduce the cost of flying Ryanair. Passengers using train and bus 
stations are already accustomed to paying to use the toilet, so why not on airplanes? Not everyone uses the toilet 
on board one of our flights but those that do could help to reduce airfares for all. "

   Feb. 27, 2009 (Baltimore Sun delivered by Newstex) -- 
Can airlines be so desperate for revenue that they will charge you to use the toilet during a flight? That certainly 
would cut down on the demand by travelers for free softdrinks. 
Read this report from Shawn Pogatchnik of the Associated Press: 
DUBLIN (AP) ” Is a bathroom an optional extra when youre at 30,000 feet? Ryanair boss Michael OLeary seems to 
think so ” as his no-frills airline contemplates charging customers to use its aircrafts toilets. 
OLeary whipped up a frenzy of indignation and potty humor Friday as he suggested that future Ryanair passengers 
might be obliged to insert a British pound coin before they gain access to in-flight relief. As always, OLeary 
suggested a separate toilet fee would lower ticket costs and make flying, somehow, easier for all. 
Nobody, even his own aides, seemed to be sure if he was serious or pursuing his well-documented penchant for 
making brazen declarations to win free advertising.
œOne thing we have looked at in the past, and are looking at again, is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on 
the toilet door, so that people might have to actually spend a pound to ˜spend a penny in future, OLeary said, using 
a local euphemism for relieving ones self. 
When asked, during an interview on BBC Television, what would happen if a customer really had to go, but didnt 
have the correct change, OLeary dismissed the scenario as implausible. This even though Ireland and most of 
Europe uses euros, not the British currency, and even on-board attendants often find themselves without the 
correct change. 
New flight fee? Airline discusses charging to use the bathroom
œI dont think theres anybody in history gone on board a Ryanair aircraft with less than a pound, he said. 
Politicians and analysts agreed that the man who pioneered charging airline customers to check bags, to use a 
check-in desk, and even to use a credit or debit card to make an on-line booking just might be serious about mile-
high toilet extortion, too. 
Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners (NASDAQ:BGCP)  in London, cautioned consumers that 
OLeary might be attempting two for the price of one: Free publicity backed by cut-throat reality. 
œThis begs a simple question retort of: Is there absolutely nothing that this airline wont do? Not really, so if you are 
thinking about flying cattle-class Ryanair in future, beware, he said. 
OLearys own chief spokesman, Stephen McNamara, said his boss often spoke tongue in cheek ” but then defended 
the idea of charging for a toilet as part of a logical trend.
 œMichael makes a lot of this stuff up as he goes along and, while this has been discussed internally, there are no 
immediate plans to introduce it, McNamara said, adding, œPassengers using train and bus stations are already 
accustomed to paying to use the toilet, so why not on airplanes? Not everyone uses the toilet on board one of our 
flights, but those that do could help to reduce airfares for all passengers. 
Rochelle Turner, head of research at British consumer rights magazine Which? Holiday, said Ryanair had a well-
documented practice of œputting profit before the comfort of its customers ” but this one could backfire.
 œCharging people to go to the toilet might result in fewer people buying overpriced drinks on board. That would 
serve Ryanair right, she said. 
Tommy Broughan, transport spokesman for Irelands Labour Party, said the toilet-charge idea had to be taken 
seriously. He noted that Ryanair last month began threatening customers with euro30 fines if they tried to carry on 
board a second bag regardless of size ” even one filled with a just-purchased item from the airports duty-free shops. 
œWhen Ryanair introduced this euro30 extra duty-free charge, many passengers joked that next they would be 
charged for using the toilet ” not realizing that this indeed seems to be the newest extra charge on Ryanairs 
agenda, Broughan said.

When Ryanair            insulted bloggers and announced they'd start            charging people for using the bathroom, 
all in the same week, all bets were off. Normally I'm a huge fan of low cost carriers, because they help keep the 
legacy carriers awake, but now it's just getting silly.
An enterprising artist over at the b3ta boards has redesigned the Ryanair safety briefing card to show how things 
will probably be on board the airline by next year. Check out their board for the full version of the design.
The sad thing is that jokes like this only seem to inspire Ryanair to come up with new ways to make money, just like 
what happened when I            joked about paid bathrooms 3 days ago.

 The "Frills" Include Urinating Ryanair may charge to use the bathroom on the plane. From            Reuters: 
LONDON (Reuters) - Irish carrier Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, might start charging passengers for 
using the toilet while flying, chief executive Michael O'Leary said on Friday. "One thing we have looked at in the 
past and are looking at again is the possibility of maybe putting a coin slot on the toilet door so that people might 
actually have to spend a pound to spend a penny in future," he told BBC television. He said this would not 
inconvenience passengers travelling without cash. "I don't think there is anybody in history that has got on board a 
Ryanair aircraft with less than a pound." O'Leary has a reputation as a cost cutter, expanding Ryanair by offering 
low headline fares and charging extra for items such as additional luggage. via            Consumerist

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Europe's biggest discount airline, Ryanair, says the carrier is considering 
charging passengers for restroom access while flying.
But a company spokesman discounted the possibility saying O'Leary, a plain-speaking, fun-loving manager, 
sometimes just makes things up.
The airline has no firm plans to put coin slots in airliner restroom doors, said the spokesman. 
Ryanair derives much of its income from sales of extra services. The airline, for instance, sells transportation from 
its sometimes distant airports to city centers. It charges extra from desirable seats, and on-board refreshment. 
The company sells advertising on its tray tables and sells the exterior of some of its aircraft as flying billboards.

It's been a long week, and I'm really looking forward to the            Rogue Festival. But, first, here's what caught my 
attention in recent days:
   No kidding here. You may have to pay to, um, urinate on a plane trip. That's a trend that could start because 
Ryanair in Europe is considering a lavatory fee for its planes.  I read it in The Bee, but it's still sad to know that 
famed photographer Annie Leibowitz has            pawned her legacy because of mortgage debt. Maybe she can line 
up more shoots with            Queen Elizabeth.  The New York Post            dumped legendary gossip queen Liz 
Smith. Sad, but I also have to confess that I stopped reading her stuff years ago.  Spiderman will            become a 
musical, with songs provided by U2's Bono and The Edge. We find out if it works in 2010.  And, finally, comedian 
Jerry Seinfeld is returning to TV. But not to appear in a sitcom. He's going the reality route in an            unscripted 
show about marriage. Is this for laughs?

In the airline Public Relations (PR) world, lowly bloggers like those at Gadling get various degrees of attention. 
Younger, edgier airlines who realize the influence and flexibility of travel blogs are close with us. Legacy carriers 
who are rooted in their old ways of anti-technology don't give two shakes about us, which is fine. But Ryanair? They 
don't tolerate the blog world too well at all.
A recent posting by web developer Jason Roe shows just this. Roe posted an interesting article that suggested that 
he had found a way to book $0 fares on the Ryanair website. He was incorrect, in fact -- the fare couldn't actually 
be purchased and he had just found a loophole, but at the time it generated a lot of reaction. And among the 
commenters was who turned out to be a Ryanair staffer, whose many tirades include "jason! you're an idiot and a 
liar!!"
Jason responded coldly, saying that a bug still existed, and so the spat began. Eventually, the official hand of 
Ryanair came in with a statement only slightly classier than the original staffer's words, saying:
It is Ryanair policy not to waste time and energy corresponding with idiot bloggers and Ryanair can confirm that it 
won't be happening again.
Lunatic bloggers can have the blog sphere all to themselves as our people are far too busy driving down the cost of 
air travel.
Clearly, the airline isn't worried about offending anyone in the "blog sphere." Perhaps after all of their            
negative campaigns and bad press they think that we're already lost?

            This is either another indicator of organizational arrogance, or a sign that some very odd people work at the 
company, but take a look at what's happening with            Ryanair.
Either way, it's a huge public relations cock-up.
If you're a user of the Irish budget airline's website and then write a blog post about your experience with it and 
finding a bug, complete with screenshots, here's a taste of what you can expect from Ryanair if they come a-visiting 
and decide to join the conversation, as happened to Jason Roe last week.
A couple of sample comments, starting with            Ryanair Staff #1:
jason!   
you're an idiot and a liar!! fact is!    
you've opened one session then another and requested a page meant for a different session, you are so stupid you 
dont even know how you did it! you dont get a free flight, there is no dynamic data to render which is prob why you 
got 0.00. what self respecting developer uses a crappy CMS such as word press anyway AND puts they're mobile 
ph number online, i suppose even a prank call is better than nothing on a lonely sat evening!!
           Ryanair Staff #3:
Website is not perfect, Life is not perfect...   
If you would work in your pathetic life on a such big project in a such busy environment with so little resources, you 
would know that the most important is to have usual user behavior scenarios working rather than spending time on 
improbable and harmless things.    
The finger from Ryanair
We very well know about these anomalies and unless it is not critical we are not going to sacrifice time to this.    
If you would be a serious programmer you would know these things and would not post any of this on the web if you 
would think it can cause us troubles, but you would report to us directly.    
Even you did not discover anything major you are still trying to benefit from this.    
If I would be you I would think of consequences this can have.    
If you would be a serious developer you would work out your About page as well. Or is this really about you? What 
is that bunch of links there? I could give my review of those websites and it would not be positive probably, but 
really I don't know if you actually worked on them or what exactly you did and how big influence you had to make 
changes there. So keep working on yourself and don't post bollocks.
So there, Jason, that's you put in your place!  
On the face of it, the comments purely look like theyve been made by Ryanair employees who are either clueless 
about online engagement behaviours or simply don't care at all. I can't imagine this reflects an organizational 
approach to engagement using words, phrases and overall language that basically says 'fuck off' to any critic.
Then again,            Ryanair employees do have a unique leadership communication model to emulate.
Of course, it's also possible that this is a huge scam on Ryanair with con artists pretending to be employees. No 
one's suggested that, though.
This story is now getting            picked up in the mainstream media. And the comment above from Ryanair Staffer 
#1 which included "what self respecting developer uses a crappy CMS such as word press anyway"            
attracted the attention of WordPress architect Matt Mullenweg. So that's given this even wider awareness among 
influencers online.
I don't expect to see Ryanair react in any meaningful way, certainly not with an apology, as they don't have a track 
record of that kind of behaviour when dealing with critics. But you never know -- maybe this might be the time when 
Ryanair gets humble (that's probably a bit fanciful).
So I'm watching communication developments with interest.

By now I'm sure everyone has heard of Ryanair, the cheeky European low cost carrier. Their insanely low fares 
have turned them into the third largest airline in Europe.
Of course, in order to offer low fares, you need to cut a few corners. You won't find any free pretzels on Ryanair. In 
fact, pretty much anything service related is either non existent, or requires an additional fee.
Their latest cost saving measure is to completely remove all airport check-in desks. That's right - the familiar desk 
at the airport where a smiling airline employee would get you checked in and on your way to the gate is being 
replaced by the Internet.
Ryanair now expects all their passengers to check-in using the web. Of course, this would not be a huge issue if 
anyone could use the service, but non-EU passengers on Ryanair are unable to do a web checkin. This means that 
anyone without a European passport will be forced to use (and pay for) the single baggage drop desk at each 
Ryanair location.
We've finally reached a point where a super cheap ticket starts to look less and less interesting. What good is a $20 
ticket when the cost of checking in at the airport and taking 2 bags with you can add an extra $80? I've long joked 
that we'll eventually see an airline charge for using the bathroom, but now I'm convinced that we'll actually see that 
happen some time this year.

 The good news is, the            flights are short so the misery can only last for so long. It will be like every country 
bumpkin who steps on the Eurostar and immediately starts yapping on their phone at levels loud enough for the 
entire train to hear "we're leaving London now on the train...yes, the train that goes under the Channel..." (Yes, the 
damned train that has been running for around 15 years now. *That* train, now shut up.)
It's one of those common courtesy things where nice people step between cars and call instead of waking the dead 
as though mobile phones were only invented yesterday and insist on yelling. I like to think my groans on the train of 
"shut up and go to the end" have helped but I have plenty of company in that department these days. If Facebook 
wasn't so evil, I might even start a group of those who detest phone screaming on trains or other confined areas but 
fortunately the actions infuriate others enough to charge into action without an online group. French railways have 
been assigning seats in talking cars or no-phone cars which is great. This works well for everyone who can't 
manage the 3 second walk to the end of the car.
On the new Ryanair flights, you'll be out of luck as there will be nowhere to hide. On the upside, as long as you 
aren't carrying any luggage or want anything to drink, the price is nice. Pack your ear plugs and everything will be 
fine.In its illustrious history of reshaping air travel, Ryanair has totted up many firsts. It proudly introduced the £9.50 
airport check-in fee, bravely pioneered the £3 cup of no-frills instant coffee and recently dreamt up the brilliant 
wheeze of charging £30 if your duty-free fails to fit in your hand luggage.
Shortly after 10am yesterday, flight FR113 from Gatwick to Dublin changed flying in Britain forever by unleashing on 
the unsuspecting air traveller another budget airline innovation. Precisely seven minutes after take-off, a green light 
on a newly-installed overhead cabin sign lit up, reading: "Mobile use permitted."
Rest assured, the steeply-priced snacks were still there, along with the £9.50 airport check-in fee, the £16 excess 
baggage levy and the eye-watering £142.50 charge to change a name on a ticket. But to this cornucopia of what 
Ryanair introduces mobile calls on flights
Ryanair likes to call its "ancillary revenues" can now be added a new wallet-bashing in-flight experience “ the £3 per 
minute mid-air phone call.
From this week, Ryanair's 67 million passengers will be able to use their mobile phones at 30,000ft, after the Irish 
airline installed cutting-edge technology that allows voice calls, text messages and emails to penetrate one of the 
few remaining modes of public transport that has hitherto been free from those conversations along the lines of: 
"Hello? Hello? I'm on the ... Hello? Hello? Yes, it's me, I've been delayed... Hello? Hello?"

 Oh sure, the idea of having            in-flight calling capabilities is pretty awesome, but actually biting the bullet and 
paying international roaming fees in order to indulge is likely to be a stretch. Ryanair, one of Europe's low-cost 
airlines, has finally equipped 20 of its planes (all traveling to / from Dublin) with in-flight mobile service after 
promising it around            1.5 years ago. Ryanair confesses that typical prices will be around ??0.50 to send a text 
message and between ??2.00 and ??3.00 per minute to make and receive calls. In other words, you'll probably be 
keeping your conversations to yourself until you touch down, but at least it's there in case of emergency. Or 
something.

 Last year, Ryanair optimistically announced that they were just "weeks" away from launching their in-air mobile 
phone and data service.
It took a little longer than planned, but the first 20 planes are now equipped with the gear needed to let passengers 
annoy their fellow passengers with their mindnumming phone conversations.
The 20 planes are all on routes to and from Dublin, and the service allows passengers to make and receive phone 
calls, send and receive text messages, and transmit data.
Thankfully, the in-air prices are so high, that most people will probably keep their calls to a simple "hi mom, I'm in 
the air".
Calls will cost between ??2 and ??3 per minute, and data is a staggering ??1.50 per 100KB (about the size of a 
basic email). For comparison - a 3 hour broadband WiFi session on Virgin America costs under $10.
Of course, the whole thing is rather ironic, since we have been told for years that keeping your phone on may result 
in the plane crashing and killing everyone. That was of course until the airlines learned they could make money off 
your calls. Then it was suddenly no problem.
Jeffrey covered a different angle of in-flight mobile phones today; the mobile phone in the cockpit. Of course, the 
issue here is not interference from signals, but the interference from a ringing phone during critical portions of the 
flight.
I'm pretty much addicted to my mobile phone, but even I think filling a low cost carrier plane with 100 chatting 
passengers will eventually result in someone having to have their mobile phone surgically removed.

   Feb. 10, 2009 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) --  Europe. For Spring Break? You must be joking right? 
Surely in this time of economic crisis and tightened budgets the European continent is out of reach for most, 
especially for the student traveler looking to save a few bucks on their Spring Break. And that's why we're here to 
tell you just how remarkably affordable AND easy it is to spend that week off partying it up in            Prague, 
museum-hopping in            Madrid or beer drinking in            Berlin.Believe it or not, Spring is one of the best times 
to visit most European countries. Most travelers wait until summer to hit the continent, but that's exactly why Europe 
has a reputation for being so crazy expensive. By traveling in the off-season you'll have access to some incredible 
deals on airfare, not to mention you'll get most of the museums, restaurants and trains all to yourself.So why blow 
all that money on a Spring Break trip to Florida, the Caribbean or Mexico? For not much more money, you could be 
hanging out in            world class museums during the day and            partying till dawn at some of the world's best 
nightspots. How's that for some Spring Break fun? Come along on Gadling's Budget Travel Guide to Spring Break 
in Europe.
The European Airfare GameI like to think of finding a cheap airfare to Europe as a game. Getting from North 
America can often be one of the biggest expenses facing the European budget traveler - an obstacle that often 
threatens to break the bank. But fear not, with a little flexibility and planning, you too can win the European airfare 
challenge. Here's how to do it: Check the "Big Five" - the vast majority of European flights from the U.S. are 
funneled through just five airports:            London Heathrow,            Paris Charles De Gaulle,            Frankfurt am 
Main,            Madrid Barajas and            Amsterdam Schipol. Even if you plan on heading somewhere else, flying 
into one of these hubs and then connecting elsewhere is often the cheapest option. Once you arrive, consider 
grabbing a flight on a European low-cost carrier or taking the train to your final destination. Use the Budget Carriers 
- Europe is known for its cheap inter-country low-cost carriers like            Ryanair and            EasyJet. Even if you 
fly into one of the "Big Five," the low-cost carriers ensure that getting to your final destination can still be a bargain. 
For the full rundown on the low-cost carrier game, make sure to read Scott's great            Low Cost Carrier post 
from last week. Be flexible - as Grant pointed in this            cheap airfare post, finding reasonable tickets to Europe 
is all about being flexible. Try and avoid flying on the most popular days like Friday and Sunday and schedule your 
trip at off-peak times. And don't get your mind dead-set on one particular destination. Is London showing up too 
expensive? How about Dublin instead? Can't find a cheap European flight out of Philadelphia? What if you took the 
Budget Travel: European Spring Break
train up to New York for your departure? The more options you give yourself, the more money you can save.  So 
just how much money are we talking for Spring airfares? A quick search of Kayak for European filghts in March 
pulls up flights from New York to Dublin ($308), Madrid ($367) and Berlin ($380) among plenty of other options. 
Boston has fares to Dublin for $365 and Chicago has flights to Frankfurt starting at $424. Anything to Europe for 
under $450 is practically a steal.Where to StayNot surprisingly, the fallback option for many budget-minded 
European Spring Breakers is going to be the hostel. Sites like            Hostel World let you review ratings and prices 
and make bookings right from the web.But if you're like me and you've reached an age when a dude strumming his 
acoustic guitar in the lounge until 3am is not going to cut it, consider renting an apartment. Most decent size 
European cities offer a thriving market in vacation rental apartments, many of which can be had for not much more 
than your average night's stay on an uncomfortable bunk bed. Check out sites like            VRBO or            
Craigslist's "Vacation Rental" category and look up something you like.            Couch Surfing can also be a great 
option for thrifty travelers looking for a more adventurous experience staying with a local.           Top Three Spring 
Break CitiesIt's not any fun to be in Europe if you don't have the money to enjoy it. Here are our picks for the best 
"cheap" European destinations that mix great nightlife with some interesting sights at a lower cost. Berlin - Berlin 
offers the best of both worlds for Spring Breakers, combining world class art and culture with one of the world's 
more hedonistic and creative nightlife scenes. Not to mention it's one of the cheapest cities of all the big European 
capitals. During the day make a stop at the            Pergamon, home to one of the world's greatest collections of 
Greek and Middle Eastern antiquities (8 euros). Art lovers should check out the            Hamburger Bahnof which 
houses works from 20th Century masters like Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg (free on Thursdays!). Berlin 
is also home to a thriving music scene. Electronic music fans should head to the            Watergate Club, where 
partiers can dance till dawn against the club's floor-to-ceiling windows along the River Spree. Dublin - Dublin has 
the honor of being one of the closest cities to the U.S. mainland, ensuring a cheap flight over. That said, Dublin is 
also hugely entertaining base for a Spring Break week, offering a lively pub scene in the            Temple Bar area, as 
well as interesting sights like the            Book of Kells at            Trinity College and the            National Museum of 
Ireland. Booze-lovers can head for either the            Jameson Distillery or the            Guinness Storehouse to learn 
more about how the beverages are made and get a free sample. Prague - Prague is the Spring Break trip's secret 
weapon. The Czech capital is not yet on the Euro, meaning your dollar goes a lot farther and there's also plenty to 
see and great nightlife to be had. Start your visit with a trip to            Prague Castle, an imposing fortress that sits 
across the river from the main city center. On your way you'll cross the atmospheric            Charles Bridge. It's free 
and the wide stone footbridge is lined with vendors, street artists and ornate statues of the town's historical figures. 
End your evening with some Jazz at one of Prague's many underground            Jazz clubs or dancing at the            
Roxy, which operates out of an old movie theater.             European Money-Saving TricksSo you snagged an 
insanely cheap flight, you're staying in an apartment or hostel, and you're traveling to one of Europe's bargain-
priced cities. What else can you do to keep costs manageable? Never fear, here's a few more money-saving tips to 
make that Europe trip all the more affordable. Carpe Diem - as Latin majors can attest, Carpe Diem translates as 
"seize the day." And with the Dollar to Euro exchange rate hovering at its most            favorable point in almost 2 
years, there's never been a better time to take advantage. Skip this Spring Break and who knows if your money will 
go nearly as far for Spring Break 2010. Eating In - sure, it might seem painful to skip out on a plate of tapas or that 
extra croissant, but cooking your own meals can save you some serious money (while also being quite delicious). 
Virtually all hostels have a kitchen for guests - not to mention if you rent an apartment you'll have a kitchen all to 
yourself. And shopping for fresh local ingredients at markets like            La Boqueria in Barcelona or the            
Campo de Fiori in Rome can be a fun experience in and of itself. Feel bad about passing all that great food? 
Consider using the Euros you have left over at the end of your trip on a big fancy meal to make up for your frugality! 
City Pass - are you planning to visit museums and attractions like it was going out of style? Many European capitals 
offer city passes, which bundle admission to a variety of attractions along with unlimited access to public 
transportation for one price. Sites like            European City Cards sell passes for a variety of European tourist 
destinations. And check your guidebook - many museums offer            FREE admission on certain days of the 
week. Public Transportation - whenever possible, stick to the metro and buses. Most European transit systems are 
extensive and will take you just about anywhere in the city confines for one low price. And consider buying an 
unlimited pass for the length of your stay - it will be much cheaper than paying as you go if you plan to take a lot of 
trips.               Budget Travel: European Spring Break originally appeared on            Gadling on Tue, 10 Feb 2009

   Jan. 28, 2009 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --  Yes, this is a post about Italy, but believe it or not, 
Alitalia isnt the main focus.  Its the bungling Italian government that has caught my eye once again for their plans to 
help Alitalia and kick low cost carriers to the far corners of the Rome metro area.  If your flag carrier cant win 
through competition, might as well play dirty and help them out, right?  Sheesh. I dont speak Italian, so my 
understanding of the situation relies on            Google Translate and a            Ryanair press release.  Heres what 
seems to be happening. Noise has been a sensitive issue for those living around Ciampino airport, a mere 10 miles 
from central Rome.  The airport had been growing with Ryanair and EasyJet having substantial operations along 
with smaller operations from Wizz and, apparently, an airline called            Romavia (which still flies a 707?!).  
Alitalia and pretty much everyone else fly from Leonardo da Vinci Airport at Fiumicino, about 25 miles from the city 
center. The regions government decided to turn Viterbo, an old military base about 60 miles north of the city into the 
third airport for the area.  Just to get an idea for how far out this place is, take a look at this map:
View Larger MapIf they want a third airport, thats there own business, but now all the noise complaints caused them 
to run a study.  According to Ryanair, the results prove that there isnt a huge noise issue, but the regions 
government is still looking to shrink or shut the airport anyway.  It wouldnt surprise me. Raise your hand if you know 
who would get the biggest benefit by having Ryanair and EasyJet move to the far away Viterbo airport.  Thats right, 
its our good friends at Alitalia. If anyone knows more about this story AND speaks English, hit the comments.  By 
the way, if you just want to complain about the noise around the airport, dont bother.  That airport is one of the 
oldest in the world - its been there since 1916 - so you knew what was there when you moved in.    addthis_url    =

   Jan. 23, 2009 (Plane Buzz delivered by Newstex) --  Take one major airline.Have that major airline use 
bankruptcy as an excuse to destroy its employee pension plans.Have same airline continue to enjoy some of the 
most adversarial management/employee relations in the industry.Add just one more objectionable move on the part 
of said airline's management to the almost-boiling pot.Stir.Back off and watch as the pot boils over.Today that is 
exactly what has happened, as United Airlines' pilots are reacting to the news that the airline plans to link-up with 
Irish airline Aer Lingus to offer flights between the U.S. and Madrid. Say what?
Starting next year, both airlines will market the flights and each airline will have their own flight numbers on the 
route.But United Airlines' employees will have nothing to do with the actual operation of the flights.No, Aer Lingus 
will fly the planes with their crews. And provide the planes. United will handle the marketing for the flights.According 
to a report in Bloomberg, "Aer Lingus and UAL will review the partnership after two years and may turn it into a 'full-
blown joint venture,' with the Irish carrier owning 51%."Not surprising that the United pilots are not happy about this 
news. Looking at the details of the deal this looks like nothing more than a glorified wet lease.Meanwhile, United 
Airlines continues to sit on a stagnant-to-declining fleet, and continues to announce furloughs for its own pilots and 
flight attendants.In a message from the Chairman of the airline's ALPA MEC, Steve Wallach told the troops,"The 
day after reporting one of its worst quarterly financial results in history and after furloughing an additional 254 pilots 
(bringing the total to 606 pilots), United Airlines announced today that it has entered into what it calls an "innovative" 
partnership with Aer Lingus"....He then added, "Aer Lingus has advised the Irish press that this joint venture will 
operate an Aer Lingus aircraft with neither United nor Aer Lingus employees, under a separate operating certificate 
and under newly established wages and working conditions. Obviously, this partnership will be accomplished at the 
expense of United's and Aer Lingus' own pilots and other employees. This development, where United attempts to 
establish an airline operation without the use of United aircraft or employees, is nothing less than the outsourcing of 
jobs to an international company, and clearly demonstrates that this management continues to make business 
decisions without regard to its pilots and other employees.....The United pilots are exploring every option to put an 
end to the company's blatant disregard and lack of loyalty to the United Airlines brand."  By the way, we all should 
have known that Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary wouldn't sit around and be quiet on this development. As most of 
you know, Ryanair is in the middle of yet another hostile takeover run at Aer Lingus.Today Ryanair issued a 
United Airlines Seems Determined to Piss Off Employees; O'Leary Tees Off on News
statement in which O'Leary said, "    "Aer Lingus and United Airways share many similar traits. They both used to 
be big in the 1950's and 1960's, but sadly today they are just shadows of their former glory. Both have recently 
announced losses, job cuts and pay cuts. After months of trawling around looking for partners, it is a sad reflection 
on Aer Lingus that the best they could come up with is one of the weakest and biggest loss makers in the U.S. 
airline industry. Given the scale of United's losses there is no guarantee that they will even be around in March 
2010 to operate this "partnership".    "It is hard to think of any transatlantic airline losing any sleep at the thought of 
being faced with the combined weakness of Aer Lingus and United Airlines on the Madrid-Washington route. 
Today's announcement shows just how desperate Aer Lingus is to find a partner, any partner it can, even if the 
flights don't start until March 2010. This so called "partnership" with another "loser" like United shows that Aer 
Lingus has no independent strategy, and no prospect of remaining independent." That's what I like about Mr. 
O'Leary. He's never afraid to tell us what he really thinks.   Newstex ID: PBZZ-0001-31225951

airline -- I would have expected the airline to have at least discussed this "innovative agreement" with its pilot union 
before it was announced. At least.Actually, I'm more interested in an arm-wrestling contest between Ryanair's

   Jan. 22, 2009 (The Dallas Morning News delivered by Newstex) --  On Thursday morning, Aer Lingus and United 
Airlines announced they were going to start code-sharing on a couple of trans-Atlantic flights. It didn't take long for 
low-fare competitor Ryanair, which has been trying to buy control of Aer Lingus, to weigh in. 
Ryanair's headlne on its press release: "RYANAIR CONGRATULATES AER LINGUS ON FINDING A PARTNER 
WHICH IS EVEN WEAKER AND IN WORSE SHAPE THAN AER LINGUS" The Irish transport minister on 
Thursday turned down Ryanair's latest offer for controlling interest in Aer Lingus, one-fourth owned by the Irish 
government. The official said the Ryanair offer under-valued the carrier. And the head of United's pilot union also 
issued a scathing attack on the marketing arrangement. For the rest of Ryanair's billet doux, keep reading. 
Underneath it will be the pilot comments. Ryanair, today (Thursday, 22nd Jan '09), congratulated Aer Lingus on the 
announcement of its "partnership" with United Airlines to operate a route between Washington and Madrid - in 15 
months time - from March 2010 onwards. This partnership, which joins Aer Lingus to one of the weakest U.S. 
airlines doesn't add one job, one passenger, or one visitor to Ireland whatsoever. United Airlines in 2005 defaulted 
on pension obligations for 122,000 employees, when its $9.8 Billion pension default was one of the largest in U.S. 
history. Ryanair believes that United Airlines is in many ways similar to Aer Lingus. Both have recently announced 
losses (in United's case a $5.35 Billion - yes Billion - loss) for 2008, and both airlines have recently announced 
capacity cuts, route cuts, pay cuts and job cuts. Responding to this "partnership" today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary 
said: "Aer Lingus and United Airways share many similar traits. They both used to be big in the 1950's and 1960's, 
but sadly today they are just shadows of their former glory. Both have recently announced losses, job cuts and pay 
cuts. After months of trawling around looking for partners, it is a sad reflection on Aer Lingus that the best they 
could come up with is one of the weakest and biggest loss makers in the U.S. airline industry. Given the scale of 
United's losses there is no guarantee that they will even be around in March 2010 to operate this "partnership". "It is 
hard to think of any transatlantic airline losing any sleep at the thought of being faced with the combined weakness 
of Aer Lingus and United Airlines on the Madrid-Washington route. Today's announcement shows just how 
desperate Aer Lingus is to find a partner, any partner it can, even if the flights don't start until March 2010. This so 
called "partnership" with another "loser" like United shows that Aer Lingus has no independent strategy, and no 
prospect of remaining independent. "Today's "partnership" comes on the back of a series of recent flip-flops by Aer 
Lingus on fuel surcharging, the Heathrow-Shannon route and Dermot Mannion's EUR2.8m failure fee and sadly 
Ryanair hissing like an ex-wife (or spurned suitor)
shows that Aer Lingus has no credible strategy either for independence or for growing traffic, tourism and jobs in 
Ireland. Aer Lingus can't match Ryanair's prices, it can't match Ryanair's punctuality, and it can't match Ryanair's 
strong growth and vision for the future either". Statement from Captain Steve Wallach, Chairman, United Master 
Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association: "The day after reporting one of its worst quarterly financial 
results in history and after furloughing an additional 254 pilots (bringing the total to 606 pilots), United Airlines 
announced today that it has entered into what it calls an 'innovative' partnership with Aer Lingus. "Aer Lingus has

demonstrates that this management continues to make business decisions without regard to its pilots and other 
employees. "The United pilots are exploring every option to put an end to the company's blatant disregard and lack

   Jan. 22, 2009 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --             TripAdvisor put out the results of a study 
yesterday regarding airplane safety.  Im sure it was spurred by the US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  accident last week, 
and I have to say that the results seem absolutely, completely wrong.  
It may not be their fault - some people may want to say theyre safety-conscious after seeing an accident like we 
saw last week, but they must be lying. Here are some of the findings: 30% say they always pay attention to the 
safety briefing and another 38% often do Are you kidding me?  Theres no way.  Most people are reading 
magazines, squeezing in a last phone call, yelling at their children, or sleeping.  I actually do pay attention every 
time (cause Im anal like that), and I rarely see anyone else watching unless the flight attendant happens to be hot. 
Of those who dont pay attention, 81% say its because they already know it This is bull . . . oh wait, I believe this.  I 
think most people who fly frequently do feel they know it by heart, so they dont bother to pay attention.  But even if 
you know it, this is a great opportunity to review.  Different types of planes have different types of doors, so you 
should brush up on knowing which type youll need to use to run screaming from the plane.  Also, it reminds you to 
check where your oxygen mask comes from, and it shows you how to put a seatbelt on.  Tough one, I know. 50% 
have read the safety card Um, ok.  Ill believe that 50% have read it at some point.  But those cards are just so 
boring and hard to read that I think most people gloss over it.  If only others took the approach that            Sun 
Country takes.  Something tells me that Ryanair has more luck since they post the card on the seatback in front of 
you so you cant avoid it. 73% say they always check the location of exits and another 20% often check Seriously?  I 
believe that people may make a mental note of where they came in, but I bet most people forget to look if the 
nearest exit is behind them (as the safety briefing would remind you).  Also, I bet very few people are as detailed as 
I am and actually count the number of rows forward and backward to the nearest exit.  If you go down, there may 
not be any lights or even worse, there may be a bunch of smoke.  That prevents you from seeing anything, so if you 
count, you can easily find your way. 75% say they would know what to do in a water landing Ok, I believe that most 
people think they know what to do, but I bet most people wouldnt do it right.  I bet most people would pop the first 
exit they saw even if its submerged under water.  Not such a good plan. 91% always keep their seatbelt fastened 
Again, really?  I cant tell you how often I see people with their belts off.  Im a freak about this one too, because if 
youve got your belt on, turbulence wont be able to smash your face into the ceiling.  If its off, well, all bets are off. 
So I guess Im not blaming TripAdvisor here for trying, but people lie a lot.  Just because they say something doesnt 
TripAdvisor Says People Watch Safety Briefings; I Call Bullshit
mean its true, and on most of these results, Id bet thats exactly the case.  I will bet that after the US Airways 
accident, there will be a temporary increase in the number of people who pay attention, but as usual, that will fade 
away.    addthis_url    = 'http%3A%2F%2Fcrankyflier.com%2F2009%2F01%2F22%2Ftripadvisor-says-people-

   Jan. 14, 2009 (Investopedia Advisor delivered by Newstex) --  Part of the recent  rally  in some, though not all, 
airline stocks clearly was fueled by the tumble in oil prices. However, have you noticed that a few of these air carrier 
names (the smaller ones much more than the major ones) have grown their own wings and continued to rally even 
when crude prices were trying to recover?
 Maybe its time to go shopping - selectively.Oil And AirlinesIt's no coincidence that oils peak of $144 per barrel on 
July 11, 2008 was just two trading days before the Dow Jones Airline Index (DJUSAR) made an intermediate-term 
bottom. That rebound/rally lasted all the way through September 16, translating into a 72% gain.Heres the really 
interesting part: Oil continued to sink (and still is), yet the DJUSAR “ packed with  large cap  American carriers “ is 
down 20.1% since that peak.Major Airlines Were Unprofitable In 2008Perhaps thats the way it should be, though. 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL ), UAL (Nasdaq: UAUA ), AMR (NYSE: AMR ) and the other majors were all 
unprofitable in the fourth quarter of 2008 as well as the whole year. I dont see how 2009 could be significantly 
better.Even more interesting is the fact that the  S&P  Mid-Cap Airline Index is up 136.6% since July 11, while the 
S&P Small-Cap Index is up 45.9%.My point? The big airlines are apparently still doing something wrong, though the 
smaller (and foreign) airlines are doing something right. At least thats what their stocks are saying. Im taking the 
hint at face value. More importantly, Im willing to tap into the small and  mid-cap  airline uptrend with a few selective 
picks.Its actually a bitter irony when you think about it. Airlines had been paying “ okay, passing along to customers 
“ those higher fuel bills. But cheap oil means cheap fuel, which in turn means passengers can afford to fly again. 
Problem solved, right? Not quite.The Recession FactorThough the  recession  chewed away about two-thirds of the 
price of oil, its still a recession “ not exactly an economic environment that spurs a lot of air travel (particularly when 
were still paying a per-bag surcharge). Fuel may be cheaper now, but fewer people are flying, so that really doesn't 
matter. (Find out how this economic cycle affects both small and big business; read  The Impact Of Recession On 
Businesses .)So, how do I explain the disparity between the  large-cap  and small-cap airline stocks? Simple - the 
smaller carriers are more apt to be nimble on the financial side of business. Theyve figured out how to balance  
elastic demand  and fluctuating fuel prices. Many foreign airlines have effectively done the same.Best Of The Small 
AirlinesFrom the relatively small groups of companies that can walk that thin line, theres a handful I feel actually 
make for decent potential investments right now. In no particular order, I think Alaska Air (NYSE: ALK ), Ryanair 
Holdings (Nasdaq: RYAAY ) and SkyWest (Nasdaq: SKYW ) are far more deserving of a look than the likes of 
Smaller Airline Stocks Are Taking Off (SKYW, RYAAY, ALK)
Southwest (NYSE: LUV ) or US Airways (NYSE: LCC ). (Break through the clouds to see if these stocks will rocket 
higher or crash and burn; check out  Is That Airline Ready For Lift-Off? )How To Pick Winners, And Wheres That 
List From?Primarily, theyre recent survivors - carriers that have sustained reasonable operating profitability in a 
tough environment over the last six months. I like their forecasts, too, even if shockingly optimistic.Take Alaska Air, 
for instance. This smaller airline booked an accounting loss for the quarter ending September 30, but only because 
of charges related to  hedging  against high fuel costs. Had it not been for the hedge, a necessary level at the time, 
the company would have had  earnings per share  of $1.10. The need for such hedging is considerably diminished 
now that oil is trading lower, and I suspect well see the carrier make a measurable migration into the profitability 
analysts expect in 2009. (Examine various ways in which companies use derivatives to manage risk; check out  
Corporate Use Of Derivatives For Hedging .)SkyWest was profitable each of the four quarters through September 
30, verifying that its not an impossible task to deal with expensive oil. Secondarily, I appreciate the way smaller 
airline stocks have been behaving (i.e. rising). Alaska Air shares are up 191% from Julys low; SkyWest shares have 
gained 55% over the same time frame.I know thats not very " fundamental " of me, but hey “ a great company's 
falling stock is still a falling stock. Theres no need to avoid keeping the wind at your back.Coming In For A 
LandingIn any case, I think some smaller airlines are worth a closer look now, and they could stay that way as long 
as oil stays relatively stable (and under $75). Id still keep these stocks on a short leash, though, and remember - its 
not an industry-wide optimism.At the time of writing James Brumley did not own shares in any of the companies 
mentioned in this article.   Newstex ID: IVR-0001-31054724

   Jan. 14, 2009 (Slugger O'Toole delivered by Newstex) --  An extraordinary intervention by the Irish Takeover 
Panel resulted in the            cancellation last night of what would surely have been a riveting debate between 
Dermot Mannion of Aer Lingus and Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary on RTE’s Prime Time. Both parties are said to be       
     œfurious. I’m no expert on the powers of the Takeover Panel but I can’t immediately recall another case of a 
quasi-judicial body intervening with a broadcaster to gag such a broadcast before. How could public opinion directly 
prejudice any outcome? Is the Panel saying its own members would be wrongly influenced by something either 
party said in public? Might a debate collapse share prices? Thats surely up to the companies themselves to judge.  
I just about understand although still disapprove of the Panel warning the parties not take part but warning RTE 
directly to cancel seems way out of court, so to speak.  I would welcome enlightenment and so I’m sure would many 
others.  This action seems directly contrary to the public interest.    Newstex ID: SLUG-0001-31039379

   Dec. 29, 2008 (felixsalmon.com delivered by Newstex) --  BreakingViews has            launched its Poor Getting 
Poorer index, complete with predictable members such as Walmart and pawnbrokers EZCorp. (NASDAQ:EZPW)  
But there's also JetBlue:  Though leisure travel will take a hit, discount carriers like JetBlue will attract those willing 
to take 3 a.m. flights from obscure airports. 
  I'm not sure that JetBlue really fits into the euro-style "3am flights from obscure airports" category; for one thing, its 
hub is at New York's JFK, where it has a very shiny new terminal complete with massage service, a steakhouse, 
and free wifi. But with oil prices in the $40 range and an enormous number of airplanes being mothballed by 
downsizing major airlines, there would seem to be an opportunity for someone like Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary to 
start up precisely that kind of discount airline. JetBlue isn't really a discounter: I just asked Orbitz for quotes for non-
stop flights from New York JFK to San Francisco SFO leaving on Saturday and coming back a week later. Virgin 
America and Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK)  will both do it for $665; Delta (NYSE:DAL)  is $745; JetBlue is in fourth 
place on $755. American is more, at $1,050, and US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  and United don't seem interested in 
competing at all: they both charge $1,825. And more generally, JetBlue has never offered the ultracheap flights 
which built the businesses of the likes of Ryanair and Easyjet. Could it happen here? I don't see why not, especially 
if the big airlines continue their long and seemingly inevitable decline. Once the frequent fliers lose their loyalty -- 
something which has already started -- I can't see why a bunch of smaller, nimbler mammals shouldn't be able to 
see off the dinosaurs once and for all.  Already JetBlue and Virgin America are trying to position themselves at the 
high end of in-flight service and quality, with mixed results. They're more likely to want to stay there than they are to 
go downmarket and compete with bucket shops.Related LinksFlying on Empty           Tips for a Sky-High Spring

report on an advanced plan by the HNA group, owner of            Hainan Air to invest in            Charleroi Airport, 
creating 2,000 jobs. The idea that China is going to bailout Europe from the current recession might be too far-
fetched, but it looks like a - highly symbolic - encouragement.Charleroi Airport, south of Brussels, is going to be 
privatized and HNA has done a binding bid, two other parties are also still in the race. Hainan Air has been flying 
already from            Zaventem, Belgiums national airport. Zaventem came in a difficult position as the Belgium 
carrier            Sabena went under and could offer few direct international flights. Charleroi has been the preferred 
airport for cheaper airliners like            Ryanair.The HNA group wants to invest 40 million euro in a new terminal and 
160 million euro in additional projects like hotels and tax free shops. Solid details about the possible deal are still 
lacking, but more information is expected today.   Newstex ID: CHIH-0001-30511853

   Dec. 12, 2008 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --  If you read the very good but insanely expensive            
Aviation Daily or youve just been around this industry long enough, youre probably familiar with the time-honored 
tradition that is Aviation Dilly.  Every year around this time, the aviation writers at Aviation Daily and its related 
publications get together and write some good ole fashioned satire about this industry we all know and love.  Until 
this year, that is. See, Im told that the evil geniuses behind the publication have decided that the Dilly would be 
canceled this year as a cost-cutting measure.  Seriously.  Somebody please tell me Im wrong.  Im not sure what the 
actual cost is for people to put out a PDF file with some funny stories, but it cant be much.  Meanwhile, the hard-
working writers at the Daily cant be happy. Still, this sad state of affairs doesnt mean we all should be deprived of 
some good comedy this year.  We all know the airlines have given us plenty of material, so Ive volunteered to put 
together a brand new little thing we like to call            Aviation Dally for your reading pleasure. 
Thats right.  This is the Dally, not the Dilly, and it has nothing to do with McGraw-Hill (NYSE:MHP) , Aviation Daily, 
Aviation Week & Space Technology, or any other aviation-related publication that they can put together.  This is just 
a handful of us from around the industry putting together some funny bits for you.  Youll never know who wrote 
which posts.  All the articles written by, for example, Tucano Bandeirante were actually written by one person using 
that name, but no real names are being used here.  (That would be a pretty damn cool name though.) So, head on 
over to Aviation Dally at            http://aviationdally.crankyflier.com/ and let us know what you think.  There are star 
ratings on each post, so youre encouraged to pick and choose your favorites.  And if youve got a great story idea, 
feel free to send it to me (cf@crankyflier.com) and well put up the best one at the end of each week. For those who 
dont want to sift through all the stories, heres a list of the ones we have so far with direct links.           US Airways to

   Dec. 8, 2008 (AOL Weblogs delivered by Newstex) --  50 protesters from the environmentalist group Plane Stupid 
forced England's Stansted Airport to close this morning after they cut their way through security fences and chained 
themselves to railings and fences near the runway. The airport is heavily used by budget carrier Ryanair, which had 
to cancel more than 50 flights as a result of the demonstration. The protest began at three in the morning and it was 
not until 8:30 a.m. that flights resumed.Ryanair complained about the slow response from security officials:"It is 
unacceptable that the travel plans of thousands of passengers have been disrupted because BAA Stansted security 
have failed to remove a number of protesters."
Plane Stupid's protest was in response to the government's decision to add another runway to the airport. They 
have spoken out against the airline industry's handling of carbon emissions and pollution. I'm no PR expert, but 
chaining yourself near an airport runway is probably not the best way to get your point across. In fact, I'd way it was 
plain stupid.[Related Story]           Protesters disrupt service at Stansted Airport originally appeared on

   Dec. 2, 2008 (Plane Buzz delivered by Newstex) --  It seems that we have news of a merger a minute these days 
-- but nothing U.S. based. 
Yet.This morning, hot on the heels of the news that Ryanair was once again mounting a hostile attempt to take over 
the 70% of Aer Lingus it does not currently control (a move which, not surprisingly the Aer Lingus management 
team quickly denounced) today we have news of an attempt at a true blockbuster link-up.British Airways and 
Qantas are apparently in discussions to do the dastardly deed.According to Bloomberg,    "The airlines are 
discussing a combination after the Australian government said today in a policy paper that it might ax a rule barring 
individual foreign holdings of more than 25 percent and total foreign airline holdings of more than 35 percent. Still, 
there are no plans to abandon the so-called "Qantas Sale Act" that says the carrier must remain 51 percent locally 
owned.    'Any transaction would also comply fully with Qantas's Sale Act and Australia's international Air Services 
Agreements,' Qantas said separately.    Negotiations on a merger are "advanced," the Australian Financial Review 
said earlier. British Airways, Europe's third-biggest carrier after Air France-KLM group and Deutsche Lufthansa, 
said it issued today's statement in response to "media speculation."A merger of the two airlines would create an 
entity with annual sales of about $23 billion.What a coincidence.AMR, parent of American Airlines also generates 
about $23 million in annual revenue.And yes, you'd have to a blind person not to see why it is that the American 
Airlines-British Airways anti-trust piece of the pie is so important to this oneworld concept of world 
domination.According to various reports out this morning, both airlines would retain their own brands. Sounds like 
another Air France/KLM type of set-up that is being proposed.   Newstex ID: PBZZ-0001-30065201

   Dec. 1, 2008 (Fallond Stock Picks delivered by Newstex) --  Michael O'Leary has made a bargain basement offer 
for Aer Lingus. With oil prices down at 2007 lows the coming months should be 'better' for the industry - even if this 
only translates to 'less worse' than other industries during the recession.From the            Irish TimesRyanair has 
launched a second bid to purchase Aer Lingus in an offer that values the carrier at ??748 million, or approximately 
half the value of its first bid.The ??1.40 a share cash bid represents a premium of around 28 per cent over the 
average closing price of Aer Lingus shares for the 30 days to November 28th, 2008.Ryanair already owns almost 
30 per cent of Aer Lingus shares and said in a statement it is proposing a œmerger of the two airlines into one 
strong Irish airline group under common ownership.At 1.12pm Aer Lingus shares were 16 cent or 14 per cent higher 
??1.28, while Ryanair stock was flat at ??2.93.
What could this mean for Ryanair's stock price? Since the start of the year the stock has traded within a fairly 
orderly downward channel. The past month has seen prices up near resistance of this channel - a good sign for a 
pending break from the channel. However, the market reaction to the deal may delay this breakout a little while 
longer. Buyers have been interested when Ryanair stock dips below ??2.50 so sideline money may be waiting for 
another trip to this zone before taking the bait. My call reflects this pessimism going forward.           Within our

   Dec. 1, 2008 (Plane Buzz delivered by Newstex) --  Let no one say that Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary is not a 
determined person.This morning Ryanair announced that it will pay $1.78 (1.40) a share -- or $950 million in cash -- 
for the remaining 70% of Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus. This price represents a hefty 28% premium over the current 
stock price.Two years ago Ryanair tried to buy the airline, but only got as far as putting together a 30% stake in the 
airline.Significance of the move? When was the last time we saw a low cost carrier purchase what is considered to 
be a Legacy carrier?I suspect Mr. O'Leary may be successful in his attempt this time. There are too many things 
working in his favor as compared to two years ago.   Newstex ID: PBZZ-0001-30026178

   Dec. 1, 2008 (Slugger O'Toole delivered by Newstex) --  O‘Leary, although predicting losses for the second half of 
the year makes            a lower bid.Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost airline, on Monday offered to buy Irish rival 
Aer Lingus for 750m ($970.4m), or just half the price of its bid in 2006 which was blocked by the European Union.  
Why should it not be blocked again?  Aer Lingus’s, first reaction is keenly awaited. The            unions have no 
doubt.The initiative was “doubtless” designed to coincide with a dispute in Aer Lingus. “However workers and 
management in Aer Lingus have managed to formulate a proposal to save the airline, frustrate Ryanair’s monopoly 
ambitions, continue to promote choice to in the Irish airline industry and maintain some semblance of civilised 
working conditions.”  I heard an analyst say this morning that EU and the Irish government wouldn’t tolerate an Irish 
airline monopoly. So what’s the difference between Ryanair/Aer Lingus and the merged Air France/KLM 
(NYSE:AKH WS)  (OOTC:AFLYY)  and Lufthansa/Swiss?   Newstex ID: SLUG-0001-30014994

over            £19million has been spent on securing            an unrestricted airport licence for the City of Derry 
Airport, with £4-5million coming from Derry City Council. The rest was            part of the funding offer from the UK 
and Irish governments - and then theres the            secret deal with Ryanair.. From the            Derry Journal 
reportDeputy Town Clerk John Meehan said the costs are likely to be reflected in next years rates estimates but 
added it is too early to tell how much they will add to the rates bill locally. œThat is what the City Treasurer is now 
working on. We have just begun the rates estimates period. There will be significant challenges on the capital front 
but it will be up to members to decide that, he said.  And where are those members councillors?  Of course theyd 
still have to collect those rates.. a process that hasnt            been very successful recently.. Derry City Council could 
write that debt off.. ["literally taking            food out of childrens mouths? - Ed].  Or            sell-off the airport..

He said: "We need a recession. We have had ten years of growth. A recession gets rid of crappy loss-making 
airlines and it means we can buy aircraft more cheaply." As counter-intuitive as that may sound, the outlook for the 
industry is a lot rosier right now, despite the grim economic situation, than it was earlier this summer, thanks to the 
plunge in crude oil prices. So maybe O'Leary's theory isn't so far-fetched. -            Trebor Banstetter   Newstex ID:

   Nov. 3, 2008 (The Dallas Morning News delivered by Newstex) --  Ryanair, the feisty Irish airline that is the 
leading low-fare carrier in Europe, is talking about setting up a separate airline to offer budget fares across the 
Atlantic, for fares as little as 10 euros. Of course, travelers would pay a lot more than that. There are all the 
government fees and taxes. Plus, Ryanair charges for just about everything -- baggage fees, airport check-in fees, 
priority boarding, oxygen, changes to bookings, soft drinks, snacks and so forth. Here's a discussion of Ryanair's 
plans in            Monday's Telegraph.  (Apparently, Britain's News of the World reported the story first on Sunday. 
However, all I can find there is an interesting discussion of Russell Brand and his girlfriends.) The flights supposedly 
would go from London's Stansted Airport and Dublin to major cities like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. I saw 
no mention of Dallas in the stories. But apparently, one planning to fly in 2009 probably shouldn't wait, as we see 
from this Monday story in            The Times of London: In response to questions, [Michael] O'Leary, the Ryanair 
chief executive, said at a meeting in London on Monday to discuss the company's performance that establishing a 
discount trans-Atlantic airline would depend on the availability of a fleet of long-distance aircraft, a situation that is 
unlikely over the course of the next 18 months.

   Nov. 3, 2008 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --  Its amazing how much traction a false story can get.  
Last night, it was supposedly leaked that Ryanair would announce in its earnings call today that it would            
begin transatlantic flights very soon.  Today, it was proven that the rumor wasnt true . . . yet. Michael OLeary has 
been quite vocal in the past in saying that it would happen (remember            beds and blowjobs?), but he reiterated 
today that the time is not yet right.  Hes waiting for it to become easy to get airplanes for cheap on the used market.  
Once that happens, hell start it up. Listen to the            BBC interview with Michael OLeary for details.    addthis_url

   Oct. 31, 2008 (Samizdata delivered by Newstex) --  During the recent            LA/LI Conference, Sean Gabb, half 
of the two-man team that now runs the Libertarian Alliance (Tim Evans being the other half) sat himself down next 
to me and asked me to suggest good speakers for next year. My best two suggestions were two Michaels. Michael 
Jennings will be well-known to regular readers here as an expert on technological trends and much else besides. 
He would be exactly the kind of second-tier speaker, and I mean this in no disrespectful way, who maybe isn't a 
superstar name who would cause dozens more attendees to sign up in the first place, but who would add greatly to 
the enjoyment and enlightenment of the event for all who did attend. Technology, I am sure you will agree, can be 
relied upon to keep on supplying interesting trends for someone like Michael to talk about. And the other Michael I 
suggested was Michael O'Leary, the boss of Ryanair. Okay, definitely a first-tier speaker, but equally definitely a 
long shot. But what's the worst he can say? No, too busy running Britain's largest low fares airline, you can afford 
my air fares but not me but the best of luck anway being what he probably would say, if anything, if asked. 
Ryanair press releases are actually fun to read (like some of            Sean Gabb's, come to think of it). Here is a 
typically populist and opportunistic snippet from the            latest one: Ryanair, Britain's largest low fares airline, 
today (31st Oct) offered to rescue Jonathan Ross after he was 'Sent to Coventry' by the bigwigs at the BBC. 
Ryanair will help Ross jet off to much more exotic surrounds as it sent him free tickets to escape the media spotlight 
and sample how those who don't earn £18million a year live. Ryanair, called on the black sheep of the BBC, who 
will lose £1.5million over the next 12 weeks, to make his money go further by escaping the high cost of living in 
Mayfair and fly on one of Ryanair's over 350 UK routes where he can live cheaper, get a tan and gear himself up for 
his return to the beeb next year. Does Coventry have an airport, I wonder? O'Leary's open contempt for state 
monopolies of all kinds, but especially in the airline business (           on the ground and in the air), is most pleasing. 
A growing trend in public opinion, especially since this latest            wall-of-taxpayer-money bailout of dodgy banks, 
is the alignment of enthusiasm for free markets with populism, while statist solutions to problems are becoming 
regarded more and more as elitist manipulations, the rich helping themselves to public money on scale that the 
poor could never dream of. O'Leary feeds into that current, I think, especially in the way he bangs on about how 
much more you often have to            pay the government, when you fly Ryanair, than you have to pay him. Michael 
Jennings, constant            globetrotter that he is, could doubtless tell libertarians about the impact of low fare 
airlines on the world, even if Michael O'Leary is otherwise engaged.   Newstex ID: SAMI-0001-29096289

the flights of fancy, we decided to offer our own, slightly more realistic suggestions:Lets keep this simple ... we are 
talking about policies which MEPs have to remember.1. Slogan: "In Europe and run by Europe".2. All expenses to 
be paid in euros, except when dollar rate is higher, when dollar payments shall be made.3. To encourage more 
employment, chauffeur-driven cars to be cleaned more often. 
Twice a day is not enough.4. New laws for approval by the EP to be printed in Braille.5. MEP assistants to be 
taught Braille so they can tell their MEPs what's in the new laws.6. No voting sessions to extend into lunch period. 
They must, therefore, terminate at 11.30.7. Ryanair to provide club class seats.8. MEP separate channels in 
airports to be screened off to stop plebs gawking.9. More facilities for guide dogs in the EP.10. Plebs required to 
doff caps when MEPs pass in chauffeur-driven cars (see above) - introduce cap subsidy to enable plebs to wear 
caps.11. That's enough laws - ed (until after lunch).We suspect that not all of these will appear in the official 
manifesto.COMMENT THREAD   Newstex ID: REFE-0001-29043510

stepping up to order new airliners from Boeing. (NYSE:BA)  Ireland's Ryanair today ordered 10 new 737-800s from 
Boeing. At list prices that order is worth $745 million. Ryanair's order was the second this week for Boeing. 
American Airlines (NYSE:AMR)  Wednesday entered orders 42 787 Dreamliners and took purchase rights on 58 
others. Ryanair is Europe's largest discount airline. The airline has ordered 17 737s this year to augment its all-
Boeing fleet. The airline operates 166 737-800s. Ryanair will accept three of the new Renton-built airliners in 
October 2010 and seven the next month. Boeing machinists have been on strike against the company since Sept. 
6. The strike has halted all airliner production at the company.    Newstex ID: TC-2481-28767466

   Oct. 7, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  The strike-related production halt at Boeing's (NYSE:BA)  Puget Sound 
area aircraft plants is beginning to take its toll on airline schedule planning around the world. The construction of 
new airliners has been stopped for more than a month because of the strike of some 27,000 Boeing union 
machinists. 
Close to home, Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK) ' vice president Brandon Pederson told airline analysts at a Colorado 
conference that the Boeing work stoppage will have "a significant impact on our business."  The SeaTac-based 
airline has 21 Boeing 737-800s on order.Ten of those are scheduled to be delivered by April. Alaska in August 
retired the last of its fuel-guzzling MD-80s in favor of the Boeings. Meanwhile in Texas, American Airlines 
(NYSE:AMR) ' said that the timing of its plan to retire its 300 MD-80s and replace them with Boeings is being 
rethought because of the strike.  American is scheduled to receive 36 737-800s in 2009 and 40 in 2010. In Europe, 
low cost airline Ryanair blamed the strike on the delayed startup of new flights from Edinburgh, Scotland and 
elsewhere. In Australia, new international carrier V Australia has told passengers booked on its new flights from 
Australia to Los Angeles beginning Dec. 15 that those flights' startup will be delayed until at least Feb. 28.  The 
airline has three Boeing 777-300ER aircraft nearing completion at Boeing's Everett plant. The airline is making 
other arrangements for passengers booked on the V Australia flights between Dec. 15 and Feb. 28.  No new talks 
are scheduled in the Boeing-union dispute. Boeing CEO Jim McNerney warned workers Monday that further 
concessions to the union could endanger the company's competitive position.    Newstex ID: TC-2481-28591830

   Sep. 9, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  As , it sounded great at the time (well, ), but it seems that things are 
going sour for Aer Lingus and Belfast International Airport. P O'Neill  in the FT with Aer Lingus CEO Dermot 
Mannion, who, presumably under the extreme pressure of the oil crisis is now .   O'Neill's take:  At the time that 
Belfast was announced, Aer Lingus said it had selected it as an alternative to a base in England (Birmingham was 
mentioned), and part of the logic was to run Belfast with a lower cost base than Dublin.  Now all of sudden Aer 
Lingus is again looking at non-Irish bases and still in search of lower costs.  And their response to Ryanair?'s 
calculations that they are not filling seats out of Belfast is to claim that even Ryanair can?'t make money on its 
flights out of there!  To state the obvious, if Ryanair has half the cost per bum-in-seat of Aer Lingus (as the article 
says), how does EI expect to make money operating from Belfast?  Indeed. And it seems  is in trouble already 
within nine months of beginning operations.  the market is on the squeeze...    Newstex ID: SLUG-0001-27960957

   Sep. 7, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  The the Spanish firm Ferrovial will net from the sale of George Best city 
airport is a drop in the ocean compared to the it acquired by its purchase of BAA including the prize Heathrow. As 
the  puts it, "the profitable sale of Belfast may raise Ferrovial's hopes of generating extra revenue from the BAA 
sales. 
This would help to reduce its enormous debt burden, which Ferrovial said last week was 23.1 billion.?" It now 
seems  for the development of City under new ownership. Operators using the airport were at first not allowed to 
sell more than 1.5 million seats a year. This was relaxed to allow 2.2 million last year and is now further eased to to 
2.7 million passengers ?- credit crunch permitting.  The new owners will have to decide whether to press ahead and 
seek to extend the runway ?- as wanted by operators such as Ryanair.  Is it premature to say the Airport Watch  
even though I see not all the locals are unhappy, soothed by the. . Is it really such hell underneath the flight path on 
the gold coast?   .....Or less often, over the city itself? They should try living in west London, where it's two flights 
minute. Belfast objectors lack one of the arguments used against a third runway at Heathrow, that would be a more 
environmentally friendly alternative for many of the half of its 67 million passengers a year who are short haul flyers. 
The same choice doesn't apply to City ?- though I suppose there?'s always Aldergrove, sorry, Belfast International.  
And then again, in the case of NI, travel broadens the mind, or so I like to think.    Newstex ID: SLUG-0001-

   Aug. 28, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  I swear, I'm going to have to change the name of this blog to Cranky 
Mythbusters, because there is just so much ridiculous stuff flying around the media right now.  Once again, it's my 
favorite whipping boy, .  This time, the title of the report is "."  Will someone please put a muzzle on these guys?
 The story is this.  A Ryanair flight was traveling from Bristol in the UK to Girona (outside Barcelona).  It lost 
pressure at altitude and quickly descended in order to get to an altitude with breathable air, 8,000 feet.  Then the 
plane diverted to Limoges, the nearest airport. The AP article would make you believe that the plane plunged 
26,000 feet as a result of the depressurization, but that's absolutely ridiculous.  The plane quickly descended 
because that's how pilots are supposed to respond when the plane depressurizes. See, those oxygen masks are 
attached to tanks that don't have a ton of oxygen in them.  They're basically there to tide you over for a few minutes 
until you can get down to a level where you can breathe on your own.  So as soon as a plane loses pressure, the 
pilots purposefully go into a steep descent to make sure that you don't run out of oxygen.  (The pilots, by the way, 
have more oxygen available for themselves.) So the AP goes out there and hears the cries of terror from 
passengers and decides to pounce on it.  The passengers were freaking out because, well, they were descending 
very quickly, and the pilots didn't come on right away to say anything.  You know why?  The pilots were too busy 
actually trying to keep them from running out of air!  Once the plane was stabilized at a lower altitude, they were 
able to come on and talk about what was happening, but priority number one is to get everyone to safety.  Then 
they talk to the passengers. If you'd like to learn more, I recommend going to this highly respectable report from the 
.  Kudos to them for actually reporting correctly on this.  As for the AP, just ignore them.    addthis_url    =

be in the balance as the airline posts . And with a, as chief financial officer Sean Coyle admitted today.He added 
that the company's cost per passenger is roughly double that of rival Ryanair. 
  With fierce competition raging between all airlines flying in and out of Aldergrove and City, it was a stinging blow to 
to reveal that after all the rows with staff in the Republic,  their abandoned Shannon/ Heathrow link.  Aer Lingus sold 
just 176 seats on its Belfast Aldergrove to London Heathrow route for the first month of operation of the new route 
in January. A total of 32,364 seats are available on the return route, with three 174-seat aircraft flying three return 
trips daily.   A year after its controversial decision to switch Heathrow flights from Shannon to Belfast, Aer Lingus 
has cornered just 10% of the Belfast/London air market.   Aer Lingus defended the airline's Belfast/Heathrow 
performance, saying market share "wasn't the main consideration" and stressing the route's improving 
performance.   But industry figures from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) confirmed that Aer Lingus carried 
about 87,000 passengers on the Belfast/Heathrow route between January and May, less than 10% of the total 
Belfast to London market, which came in at 888,000 for the five months.   Aer Lingus's sole competitor on the 
Heathrow route, BMI, meanwhile, carried almost 220,000 passengers during the same five months this year..   As 
of July 2008, Aer Lingus had , serving eleven European destinations   Only three weeks ago, Aer Lingus said it had  
reduce frequency on its services from Belfast despite crippling fuel costs.   Will that pledge survive these awful 
figures?   Meanwhile, good news in the announcement that the leading department store  is putting in another bid to 
open an all Ireland store at Sprucefield, shorn this time of the additional shop units that had caused such a furore 
with local traders in Belfast and Lisburn.  The over-worked word ?"iconic?" applies to JL even more than to Ikea 
whose opening at Holywood Exchange was regarded as such a coup.    Newstex ID: SLUG-0001-27727528

   Aug. 20, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  The typical way individual investors attempt to grow their savings in the 
stock market is by  buying and holding  common stocks over long periods of time. Indeed, there exists large profit to 
be made for diligent investors who regularly scan the market looking for undervalued stocks to buy up on the cheap 
and then hold in expectation of substantial share price increases.However, investors who follow a  long -only 
investment strategy can only profit making trades on stocks that increase in price. They've lost the opportunity to 
profit from stocks that decrease in price.Don't Sell Your Returns ShortIn order to maximize profit potential, savvy 
investors know to search not only for attractive long positions to enter in to, but potentially lucrative  short-selling  
opportunities as well. During  bear markets  this advantage can prove critical and can go a long way to helping you 
beat the market. (To learn more, check out  Short Selling Tutorial .)Wednesday Morning Short StackAs a general 
rule of thumb, stocks that have already been trending significantly downward over a one-month period of time, and 
are expected to produce negative  earnings per share  (EPS) growth for the current year are good places to start 
looking for short sale candidates. Here are five stocks that fit that bill:

Ryanair HoldingsI am generally not a bull when it comes to the airlines. It seems they're always struggling for one 
reason or another whether its government regulation, a lack of consumer spending, competition, or high  commodity  
costs. When it comes to Ryanair, I find its cheap flights attractive, but over the long haul I doubt it will be able to 
effectively compete with the big boys.  Ryanair is based in Ireland and does offer some attractive flights throughout 
Europe. It's also made it this far despite the vast increases in fuel prices over the past year. However, if the 
economy remains in the tank for an extended period of time and/or fuel prices remain at lofty levels, I have to 
wonder where the stock can go from here. (Read more on evaluating airline stocks in  Is That Airline Ready For Lift-
Off? ) At present, Wall Street is expecting the company to have  earnings per share  of 32 cents in the current fiscal

year and 97 cents a share in 2009. Hold the email Ryanair bulls, I understand that's a pretty decent rate of 
expected growth; however, for a stock that currently trades at over $25, I'm not impressed. I'm also concerned 
about the potential for some pretty hefty  tax-loss selling  near year end.Are these stocks worthy of selling short? Be

   Aug. 18, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  Nobody has ever accused Ryanair of being a "nice" airline.  On time?  
Yep.  Cheap?  Oh yeah.  But if you're looking for more than that, you're in the wrong place. 
 That's why it's no surprise that Ryanair is starting to crack down on how people buy tickets on the airline.  To make 
sure you don't get caught in the crossfire, if you fly these guys, you'll want to book direct at ryanair.com. So what 
exactly is going on here?  I must admit, I had no idea this type of problem even existed.  Companies can't just start 
selling tickets on an airline unless they have access to the airline's schedule, fares, and availability.  When airlines 
participate in distribution systems like Sabre and Worldspan, travel agents all over gain access to that.  When it 
comes to selling on the web, the big sellers will tend to have deals with the airlines directly that allow them to make 
more money from a sale as well. Ryanair isn't a fan of these things, so it doesn't participate.  The airline isn't alone 
here.  Airlines like Southwest have long shunned these distribution systems because it costs money.  Southwest 
has recently begun playing more and more in the systems in order to get the business traveler, but you still won't 
see them on any consumer-facing sites.  Ryanair, as far as I can tell, doesn't play with anyone and has really 
clamped down since they told everyone to stop selling their tickets back in May. So I was surprised when I saw the 
news that  that were booked on third party sites against their will.  I couldn't figure out how this was happening, but I 
think I get it now. Some websites out there were scraping fare and availability info from the Ryanair website and 
then selling the tickets via their own interface.  I have to assume this meant that they were just automatically making 
the bookings via Ryanair.com and then charging the passengers extra for it.  Back in May, Ryanair told them to 
knock it off, and the bigger guys did.  Some of them continued, and now Ryanair says it will cancel bookings made 
through those sites. So, if you're heading over to Europe and you want to fly Ryanair, you should really book direct.  
Or, if you just want to fly on those routes and you don't care who it's on, you should definitely shop around.  The 
online travel agents are trying to fight Ryanair by giving good deals elsewhere.  Check out CheapOair, for example.  
They're offering  as long as you fly on a DIFFERENT airline on that same route.  It's true that there aren't many 
airlines that fly to Ryanair's remote airport locations, but that doesn't mean there isn't any overlap. As far as I'm 
concerned, Ryanair has the right to do whatever they want with their own inventory.  If they don't want anyone else 
selling it, so be it.  But as a consumer, I'd be happy to take advantage of the deals that seem to be popping up 
because of this spat.  Do your homework, but if you choose Ryanair, make sure to book on their website so you 
don't find yourself in trouble.Edited @ 742a on 8/19 to change CheapOair discount from 15% to $15.    addthis_url

   Aug. 15, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --     I don't know whether to feel schadenfreude for Ryanair boss Michael 
O'Leary at his loss of income ( he's personally worth $400m), or admire him for chutzpah.. Here he is admitting he 
or failing to hedge on oil prices last year. and here again he  at the Republic's National Consumer Agency which 
has asked him to honour sales of Ryanair seats made by rival websites. How much revenue was Ryanair losing on 
these transactions I wonder?Quote   " Ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are 
ripping customers off by adding ?"hidden fees and mark-ups?".   ?"The National Consumer Agency is utterly 
useless,?" he said.   Up to 1,000 bookings a day were being made by these ?"scam artists?".   He said Ryanair was 
now cancelling bookings made by screenscraping websites".   1,000 bookings a day cancelled! Is no one 
objecting?To O'Leary, the customer is only right if he says so - and he seems to be getting away with it. Legal 
action over these websites could take a long time. Meanwhile the poor customer seems to have no redress.

   Aug. 14, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  The first chapter of my  covers Newspeak Crap and contains a glossary 
of words abused by the politicos, together with their correct meanings.  For example, "friendly fire" means "killing 
colleagues", "legal tender" means "a compulsory medium of exchange", "social justice" means "theft", and so on. 
Also in the glossary is "price war" meaning "competition to serve customers". Ever-present, "pricewar" has recently 
been  by The Guardian to describe Ryanair price cuts. You can't win of course; price increases are "exploitation" or 
"rip-offs"; even "pickpocket" was used recently by Ed Mays, chief of the National Consumer Council.Meanwhile 
poor old Ryanair is in the wars on another front, having been accused of "waging war" against consumers by its 
decision to exclude price-comparison websites from purchasing tickets through third party websites rather than 
Ryanair's own site.  "Pawns" is the word used to describe consumers by Which? Magazine (not always a true friend 
of the consumer). Similarly, (directly alongside news of the price war mentioned above) 
The Guardian  that "Ryanair to cancel thousands of  'illegal' tickets" and surreptitiously hinted that the word 'illegal' 
(in Ryanair's claim that the practice is against its terms and conditions) was dubious if not ridiculous - even though 
Ryanair has already succeeded in recent legal actions on this very point.Although it seems to me that Ryanair's 
spokesman made several telling points in support of its action, it is quite possible that Ryanair has made an error.  
But if so, it will correct it, quickly, just like British Airways did over its crucifix ban.That's the way that markets work - 
the consumer is king.  The word "pawns" is best left to describe consumers who are not served by markets.  The 
NHS is a good example, and let us not forget that it too can and does turn away patients which don't fit its templates 
or whims. And outside the directly nationalised organisations, the UK is riddled with state regulation and state 
corporatism. The airline industry is a case in point, but somehow I don't think this was what Which? Magazine had 
in mind.Click  to learn about Terry's latest book, Crap: A Guide to Politics.   Newstex ID: SMIT-0001-27395594

   Aug. 7, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  In England's , Alice Thomson writes:Julie Burchill can't stand them. 
According to her new book, Not in my Name: A Compendium of Modern Hypocrisy, she thinks all environmentalists 
are po-faced, unsexy, public school alumni who drivel on about the end of the world because they don't want the 
working classes to have any fun, go on foreign holidays or buy cheap clothes. 
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, agrees. In an interview with Rachel Sylvester and me, he told us 
that the "nutbag ecologists" are the overindulged rich who have nothing better to do with their lives than talk about 
hot air and beans. So the salad days are over; it's the end of the greens. Where only a year ago the smart new eco-
warriors were revered, wormeries and unbleached cashmere jeans are now seen as a middle-class indulgence. But 
the problem for the green lobby isn't that it has been overrun by "toffs": it's the chilly economic climate that has 
frozen the shoots of environmentalism. Espousing the green life, with its misshapen vegetables and non-disposable 
nappies, is increasingly being seen as a luxury by everyone.In addition to the deliberate misery that green policies 
cause (seen most obviously every time you fill up your car), the seeds of its destruction are sewn by the same 
people who espouse its beliefs. Environmentalism is , but a religion nonetheless, and the left, historically, works to 
undermine religious faith, quickly pointing out any sign of hypocrisy.  will tell an audience..."This is not a political 
issue," Gore told a crowd of approximately 2,500 paying attendees. "It is a moral issue. It is an ethical issue. It is a 
spiritual issue."...Before floating away . If that was Jerry Falwell using similar rhetoric but living such a lavish 
lifestyle, the hoots of derision from the chattering classes would be palpable.  Or, look at this way: everybody 
admires Mother Teresa's sacrifices, because nobody wants to actually live that way himself.  Update: Related

   Jul. 30, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --   The seven-year Doha trade talks now seem dead  By P O Neill It's hard 
to tell today whether the pessimism regarding the WTO talks which are supposed to conclude in Geneva 
tomorrow is just standard last minute brinkmanship or a sign of serious trouble.  But there is at least one strange 
aspect to the US position, which has of China and India in the last few days. For the third year running, global trade 
negotiations came to a disappointing end yesterday (29 July) as countries refused to compromise on opening up 
their national markets for agricultural goods. The talks in Geneva were considered a "last chance" for a deal before 
the US Presidential elections in November and are unlikely to be reopened before January next year at the very 
earliest. 
Riots in Belgrade as police and Karadzic supporters clash Bosnia is struggling to overcome the Karadzic legacy  By 
Peter Finn on Europe  THE HAGUE, July 29 -- Thousands of hard-line nationalists rallied in the Serbian capital of 
Belgrade on Tuesday evening to protest the expected extradition of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to a 
U.N. war crimes tribunal here on genocide and other charges for his role in the 1992-1995 Bosnian... While the 
arrest of accused war criminal Radovan Karadzic on 21 July could signal the beginning of Serbia's reconciliation 
with its role in the Western Balkan wars of the 1990s, Kosovo could still prove a stumbling block for further EU 
negotiations, argues Tomas Valasek in a 25 July commentary for the Centre for European Reform.  A rally attended 
by at least 10,000 supporters of ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Belgrade ends in violence. Escorted 
by masked officials from the Serbian secret service, Radovan Karadzic has left Serbia and is to face a U.N. war 
crimes court at The Hague EU ambassadors put off a decision on Serbia's EU ambitions until Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic is sent to The Hague.  In MAIN FOCUS  The high price of oil is wreaking havoc with Europe's 
cheap airlines: The Irish carrier Ryanair yesterday announced an 85 percent drop in its first-quarter profit while its 
British rival Easyjet has revised its profits outlook downwards. Is the era of cheap air travel coming to an end?  By 
Nabeelah Shabbir  Harmonising the first divorce regulation, bad airlines and fishermen aid - your weekly news from 
Brussels Despite marked improvements since 1990, emissions from cars and trucks continue to be the main source 
of health-damaging air pollutants, according to a new report by the European Environment Agency (EEA).  By 
Pierre-Antoine Rousseau  This night I was watching news from Belgrade where some 15.000 demonstrators were 
involved running battles with riot police after a Belgrade rally in support of Radovan Karadzic. In every capital one 
(NYSE:COF)  can find hardliners, extremists or simple hooligans so this event itself is not very dangerous. However 
While Doha dream ends, Serbian fascists riot in Belgrade ...
the serious question from my point of [ Why the EU has still to start its blue cars in Kosovo  It is hard to imagine 
Nicolas Sarkozy as a diplomat - at least until his adoption of that role became unavoidable, when on 1 July 2008 
France began its six-month  of the European Union. If it remains an an effort to think of "Sarko" performing the 
diplomat's duties, it is in large part a matter of style: for the French president seems always readier to bulldoze his 
views over his partners, to express himself in blunt and even acrimonious terms towards any leader or country bold 
enough to disagree with or oppose him, than to seek common ground or compromise.  European works are 
dominating the programme schedules of European television channels, with broadcasters preferring EU films and 
fictions to Hollywood or other extra-EU TV products, according to a report carried out by the Commission.  By david 
hayes  "They only went to Paris because they wanted to meet his wife". An Arab diplomat friend with an inexorable 
grasp of the realities of international relations is a vital source of wisdom in separating glitter from gold. The 
reference in this case was the summit organised by Nicolas Sarkozy in the Grand Palais in Paris on  which 
launched his favoured initiative, the Union for the Mediterranean (UPM); though if the event made a dramatic 
opening to France's chairing of the European Union's rotating six-month , it is doubtful that even the lustre of Carla 
Bruni could have made this more than a one-day-headlines wonder.  
Mr. Jang
 The free movement of workers was one of the fundamental principles of the Rome Treaty, signed in 1957 between 
6 European States. Workers could freely move within the European Economic Community and try their luck at 
finding a job elsewhere. One of the underlying ideas was that the free movement of workers would be a way to fight 
high unemployment in some Member States while giving citizens everywhere the chance to enjoy a better standard 
of living.   By Boz  "Started the term badly, his show-off tendencies making him unpopular in class. But he seemed 
to calm down - apparently under the influence of a girlfriend."   Newstex ID: ERFD-0001-27027069

   Jul. 29, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  Delta Air Lines Inc. will begin charging $50 for the second checked bag, 
the highest fee assessed by major U.S. airlines for a second bag. 
Delta said it does not intend to charge for the first checked bag as several of its competitors have begun doing this 
year. However, the $50 charge is more than the $15 first-bag fee and $25 second-bag fee charged by American 
Airlines (NYSE:AMR)  Inc., Northwest Airlines (NYSE:NWA)  Inc., United Airlines Inc. and US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  
Inc. "As fuel costs remain at record levels, Delta (NYSE:DAL)  believes revising the fee structure for excess bags 
and specialty items is essential to generate the necessary revenues to offset record fuel costs while continuing to 
offer these services to customers," Delta said in Tuesday's announcement. The changes are effective for tickets 
bought Thursday or afterwards for travel beginning Tuesday, Aug. 5, and afterwards. Delta was one of the carriers 
that went along after United announced a $25 fee for the second checked bag on domestic flights, but did not 
match after some others began the $15 fee on the first bag. Some small carriers like Spirit Airlines in the United 
States and low-fare leader Ryanair in Europe have long charged for bags. But big U.S. carriers didn't get into the 
game until this year as fuel prices pushed most into the red. For the big U.S. airlines, the extra fees usually don't 
apply to premium members of the carriers' frequent-flier program, full-fare passengers and others.   Newstex ID:

Ryanair's idea of cutting fairs to recoup its losses is pounding sand down a rathole.The story points out that, in 
addition to the selling of advertising space on planes, etc., Ryanair makes money through package deals like rental 
cars, etc. Nonetheless, relying on cattle-car volume to prop up unprofitable routes doesn't make sense.There is no

   Jul. 28, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --   KKR plans to go public on the NYSE. It (NYSE:IT)  won't be doing an 
IPO however. 
Instead it will be merging with some Dutch affiliate listed in Amsterday, and it will then relist on the NYSE under the 
ticker "KKR". Perfect. Said the company's two founders in the release: "This transaction offers substantial benefits 
for KPE unitholders, and it builds KKR for the long-term. Going forward, KPE unitholders will benefit by being 
owners in a diversified asset management business that generates regular distributions of cash earnings." Anyway, 
no doubt we'll have a lot more to say about it today. One nice things: because there's no IPO, perhaps the listing 
won't be quite the media circus as the last time a major PE firm went public.  This will be news to everyone except 
the six people that watch ABC's "This Week" Sunday morning program. Apparently John McCain used the word 
"villain" describe Wall St. when discussing the subprime mortgage mess. It sound like he favor prosecution, not 
mention the elimination of pay for certain Wall St. practitioners. We're not even going to bother.  RyanAir better get 
its "beds & blowjobs" cabin class onto market stat! The Irish discount carrier, famous for selling some flights at 1 
EUR (but then tacking on all kinds of ancillaries, like getting to use the jetway to get on the plane, and getting to 
check luggage), posted a sharp drop in earnings and wared it could incur its first annual loss. The cuplrit needs no 
introduction. It's oil.  This explains that collective sigh of relief we've been hearing. National gas prices averaged 
$3.996 on Friday, which means if you're filling up a big 25 gallon tank, it costs less than $100, which is pretty cool. 
Prices are at their lowest leve since May 16th.      Newstex ID: DEBR-0001-26968930

   Jul. 22, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  Merrill Lynch is really turning things around, post Holocaust of a second 
quarter. According to the Financial Times private jet use among the investment bank's senior managing directors is 
being curbed slightly. The staff must now get permission from the division's global head and prove that no cheaper 
means of travel is available. For those of you MER executives out there shivering in fear at the idea of boarding a 
plane of plebes without hermetically sealing yourself in a full-body condom first, take solace--the FT has crunched 
some numbers and apparently private jets can be a more cost-effective means of transport, if you're making it a 
group thing. A Cesna Citation CJ3, carrying six passengers, costs $14,000 ((EURO)8,800) for a trip from Teterboro 
to Indianapolis, on to Cincinnati and back, whereas a last minute return ticket from Newark just to Indianapolis will 
set Thain back about $1,000 in first class. Also, we have it on good authority the U.S. commercial airline industry is 
seriously considering Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's  to the menu. So there's that.  [FT]         Newstex ID: DEBR-

   Jul. 19, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  Some of your comments deserve a response and discussion. So let's 
take a look at some of them. Please get your facts in order before publishing this information!
 The $15 fee for the first checked bag was NOT first adopted by American Airlines (NYSE:AMR) ! Spirit Airlines and 
Allegiant Air were the first airlines to implement these fees. And if you were referring strictly to "legacy carriers" then 
make that clear! I am tired of listening [to] the incessant slams of American Airlines at every turn these days! 
jetfuel1, on an item about Delta (NYSE:DAL)  saying it isn't adopted a $15 first-bag fee like American Airlines 
MAXON: Without doing the historical research, I've got a hunch that Allegiant and Spirit weren't the first to adopt 
first-bag fees. I'm guessing that Ryanair and other European discounters are way ahead of us on that. The question 
is how many qualifiers we need to make. Spirit's first-bag fee isn't $15 -- it's $10 in advance, $20 at the airport. 
Interesting point, to consider little Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air as the trendsetters, not the world's biggest airline.  
If I had written that American Airlines was the first legacy carrier to charge $15 for the first checked bag, would that 
qualification have prevented the item from being one of the incessant slams? someone please explain to me why a 
company can lose 1 billion dollars over a 3 month period and the stock goes up?...SWA reports next week, and 
hopefully, it will again report another quarter of profit..may not be what analysts want, but a profit is good, right?...i 
think an airline that loses money should be on the way out...take UAL with you too..and an airline that makes 
money, however small should be on the way up, especially in stock price....Davey (on the 32 percent rise in the 
price of AMR stock on the day it reported a $1.45 billion net loss, $284 million excluding special charges)MAXON: 
Four things were at work, I think:1. The loss wasn't as bad as Wall Street was expecting.2. Revenues for AMR and 
other airlines grew faster than expected.3. AMR was able to boost its liquidity $720 million by airplane mortgaging 
and sale-leasebacks.4. Crude oil prices were down sharply. I'd put my money on No. 4 more than anything else. 
The other big carriers saw big jumps in stock value the same day.  Hey, was that another incessant slam at 
American? A strike would be the worst thing the pilots could do to themselves. It would shut the airline down - 
permanently in the current environment - and they would all lose their jobs and precious seniority. I have to think it's 
a bluff. If not, the responsibility for all of AMR's lost jobs will rest squarely on Captain Hill.John S  MAXON: I have 
no particular insight into the Allied Pilots Association. But unions always have strike preparedness committees. 
Don't interpret planning and exchanging ideas as meaning they plan to go out on strike next week. The APA at 
some point would like to force the issue. But the legal requirements of the Railway Labor Act mean it's still a long 
We get comments
time before the union would even have the options. And I'm sure they'd consider the ramifications carefully, just as 
you have. Terry, I say it again..lose the picture of Kelleher smoking. It is disgraceful and non-productive. I can just 
see the parent-employees of Southwest singing his praises to their children and proudly showing them this photo. 
Smoking kills thousands of people every year. Please do not glorify it.AAer MAXON: This one gives me pause 
because I'm a non-smoker and don't like to be around cigarettes. However, Herb Kelleher is always smoking. It is 
part of his persona. I cannot pretend that he doesn't usually have a cigarette in his hand. I don't know that we 
should try to toss out the ones that show him smoking. But I'll pass on your request to the people who actually 
choose what photos go on dallasnews.com. This isn't like one of those celebrity shots where a paparazzi caught 
someone guiltily sneaking a smoke. Mr. Kelleher doesn't sneak smokes; he glories in them. Two stories about Herb 
and smoking: 1. He was speaking to an SMU air law symposium in the early 1990s. The person who introduced him 
made a fervent public plea: Herb, please give up smoking for your own good. We want you around for a long time. 
When Herb reached the podium, he started out his speech by saying, "I hope you don't mind if I smoke. Because if I 
can't smoke, I'm not speaking." 2. At one annual meeting, Herb was flicking his Bic frequently to light the next 
cigarette. Finally, I noticed that he was flicking, but the Bic wasn't lighting. I looked at my watch to see how long it 
would take him to adjourn the shareholders' meeting. It took 52 seconds. Herb defends his smoking by saying he 
has floppy arteries and needs the cigarettes to tighten them up. But other readers, what do you think? Should we 
clean up Herb, take the cigarette out of his mouth on dallasnews.com? Great. We finally get done with fawning all 
over Herb and now we seem to be going through the same thing with Colleen.Scott (on an item about Colleen 
Barrett's stepping down as Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)  president) MAXON: Sorry, I'm sure we still have some 
more fawning to do over Herb.   Newstex ID: DA-2642-26778091

   Jul. 17, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  In the policy world you keep your ear to the ground and still things gallop 
up unannounced. One such is David Cameron's 'Chapter 11' proposal. 
It certainly didn't arrive through long rounds of brainstorming. More likely it came off a long list of squibs that CCHQ 
keep in order to keep DC in the news every week.Still, it's not a wholly bad idea, and the timing is excellent, since 
the UK economy is shot to pieces and lots more people will be going bust pretty soon.The idea of Chapter 11 is that 
individuals and firms who are facing bankruptcy are allowed to keep control of their assets provided they have a 
recovery plan. Does it work? Well, most of the high-profile cases have been airlines. Sure, it has staved off the 
instant shock of an airline collapsing, but it's not obvious that it has really changed what would have happened 
anyway. Some Chapter 11 filers (Northwest and Delta (NYSE:DAL) ) have merged, some (ATA) still failed, some 
(United) limp along, hobbled with debt. In the UK, by contrast, we have competition red in tooth and claw, and the 
threat of failure is all too real. And yes, weak airlines go bust. But it makes the competition so strong that cost-
conscious airlines like Ryanair and Easyjet are becoming dominant. America's airlines still look fat and bloated.The 
UK bankruptcy problem, though, is HM Revenue & Customs. When a firm fails, they are fist in the queue for 
payment. Suppliers and customers get left with a few pence for each pound they're owed. Nor surprisingly, HMRC 
is the largest filer of bankruptcy petitions. And no doubt all those nice people up in East Kilbride get fat bonuses for 
bringing in the cash. It would be better, though, if they were in the same queue as all the other creditors. Then they 
might actually do something to help businesses through these difficult times, rather than bankrupting them.

   Jul. 11, 2008 ( delivered by Newstex) --  Ever get the feeling US Airways (NYSE:LCC)  is a sinking ship that's 
throwing off as much weight as it can to stay afloat?  This week we've seen the airline  and ditch all the onboard 
equipment.  They're also getting rid of ovens in the coach galleys. 
 Yep, that means they're really, honestly, trying to get as much weight off the plane as they can to save gas.  But it's 
not just on the plane.  They're also getting rid of ticket jackets.  I always thought that ads made those profitable, but 
I guess not. You might think that I'd be flinging a Cranky Jackass award for this move, but actually, I'm not.  
Surprisingly, I have to give them credit here for actually following the strategy they've laid out, right or wrong.  This 
is the strategy that was outlined for us at .  In their eyes, all that matters is price and schedule as long as the 
appearance is clean, the flights are on time, and it's convenient.  They've , and I think they've been cleaning up their 
planes (though I haven't flown them in quite some time). In other words, though many people bemoan the direction 
the airline is taking, US Airways is actually delivering on its promises.  With that in mind, I started thinking about 
what they're going to spring on us next.  No matter what it is, there's a very good chance people will hate it, but at 
least it's not false advertising. Here is my list of the top 5 ways I'd expect to see US Airways increase revenues 
next, in no particular order.  And no, this isn't a joke or some snarky post about "gee, what could the airlines 
possibly charge us for next."  There have been far more than enough of those floating around.  Overhead Bin Ads - 
Ah come on, they've already done tray table ads, so why not just go to the overhead bins as well?  It's worse, yes, 
because you can't actually hide those from sight, but it wouldn't surprise me if they could make some decent money 
off of it.  And that means it could actually happen, even if it does somewhat degrade the "appearance."  Charge for 
Advanced Seat Assignments - I know, this is a little late to the game with Spirit already setting the bar, but why not 
jump on the bandwagon?  If someone is really going to choose you because of price and schedule, then advanced 
seating assignment fees won't really alter the decision, right?  Remove Window Shades - This takes a page out of 
the Ryanair playbook.  No window shades = less weight and fewer things that can break.  Ryanair also doesn't do 
seatback pockets, but there's too much money in the magazine and Skymall to take that away.  Would US Airways 
actually do this?  I'm not sure what the savings would really be, but if they are real, then I don't see why not.  Sell 
Products Onboard - They already pimp their credit cards, so why not follow the Skybus model and start selling 
products, like duty free in the international world?  True, that would technically add weight to the plane, so it would 
have to generate good revenue to make sense, but they might think it's worth a shot.  Charge for First Class 
Top 5 Ways US Airways Might Increase Revenues or Reduce Costs
Upgrades - I've saved the most controversial for last.  If you think there have been objections to the latest round of 
changes, just wait until something like this happens.  All hell will break loose.  I'd argue that free First Class 
upgrades are by far the most important reason someone desires elite status with the airline.  But, would people 
walk away if they had to pay $25 for the privilege on a domestic flight?  It's a risky move, and it would absolutely 
piss off the elites, but at some point they may consider it for the revenue it would raise.  Some of these are pretty 
risky moves, but with fuel where it is right now, I'm sure everything is in play.  Would any of these moves stop me 
from flying the airline?  Nah, not more than anything they've already done.  (I haven't flown them in almost 18 
months, or at least that's what my Dividend Miles expiration notice tells me.)  The reality is that they're right about a 
lot.  Price and schedule do matter most in the domestic world, and they rarely if ever have a price or schedule 
advantage from my home in the LA area. The airline has made it clear that it is racing to the bottom when it comes 
to amenities being included in the fare.  At some point, passengers will revolt, that is, if they actually have a better 
option to choose.  With all the legacy airlines following similar paths, there aren't many options left for someone who 
wants to protest.  But one of these moves will cross the line, and passengers will start to defect.  Until that happens, 
you can expect to see airlines continuing to push the envelope on what they're willing to try to reach profitability.

   Jun. 28, 2008 (Adam Smith Institute blog delivered by Newstex) --  Colin Matthews, Chief Executive of the UK 
airports operator BAA, has launched into the debate on the future of London's airports with a big speech at the 
Transport Times conference. 
There has been suggestion that more traffic should be decanted to other London airports; but, says Matthews, if 
people were unable to make connections at Heathrow (and, I suppose, faced a gruelling trip across London on the 
capital's ailing public transport system), it would be a major strategic mistake. Charles De Gaulle or Schipol airports 
would be only to happy to pick up those interlining passengers, and the UK as a whole would suffer.So he is 
strongly in favour of a third runway at Heathrow, rather than resurrecting the old idea of building a new hub in the 
Thames Estuary. (That idea was floated in the 1960s, but dropped for environmental reasons, leaving Stansted to 
become the third London airport. I cannot imagine that environmental concerns have got any lighter in the 
intervening period.) And Matthews thinks the suggestion that Heathrow should be made better before it is made 
bigger is a false choice. Heathrow needs both new runway capacity and better terminal facilities, not just one or the 
other.He's probably right on all these points, though critics like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary complain at the cost of 
BAA's new airport infrastructure projects, and that a lot of travel these days is point-to-point, which can be done 
using smaller airports that are presently underused. One thing I still think should happen, though, is that BAA's 
London near-monopoly (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted) should be broken up. We said that in the early 1980s in an 
excellent little paper called Airports for Sale. Competition works. It's time we had more of it in the provision of 
airports, just as we now do in airlines. Newstex ID: SMIT-0001-26304648

   Jun. 27, 2008 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --  I thought about writing about more cuts that were 
announced by            Frontier,            Northwest, and            Delta, but really, aren't you getting tired of this?  Click 
the links above if your answer is "no."  Otherwise, keep reading for a little bit of escapism to end the week.It's been 
a long time since I wrote a book report.  I mean, throughout school it usually meant finding a way to write paper 
after paper on books that absolutely drove me insane.  It's safe to say that I haven't fully recovered from "           
Ethan Frome."   Of course, this time around it's a different story.  I'm writing about a book about airplanes, well 
mostly about airplanes, so that's a good start.  
This time, I'm writing about "           Ruinar: How to be Treated Like Shite in 15 Different Countries . . . and Still Quite 
Like It."The title had me interested right away.  That and the pretty airplane on the cover.  So when the author 
offered to send me a copy, I was more than happy to dive in.  It arrived and the first thing that caught my eye was 
the big red sticker on the front saying, "Only â,¬0.01* - *price excludes fees and charges of â,¬12.98 (full price 
â,¬12.99)"  I love it.  The author clearly knows Ryanair well.So what did I think?  It was a fun read without question, 
but there were a couple of things that seemed to be thrown in just to fill up space and other parts that didn't seem to 
fit at all.  Overall, it's a worthwhile read if you're looking for something light (mostly) with a dry and witty humor.The 
premise was simple enough.  The author had a bad flight on Ryanair back in the day, and he paid â,¬300 for the 
privilege.  So, he decided to try to fly to every single country in the EU with a couple others thrown in (not counting 
recent Eastern Europe additions) for the same price and tell his story.  You might think (and hope) that the book 
would focus more on his flying experience, but it seems to be more of a hybrid.  While he talks about the flights, he 
spends an equal or greater amount of time talking about his experiences in the countries themselves.  In those 
chapters that focus on his flying and traveling experiences, the book works quite well.Possibly the only thing that 
really bothered me was the intentional misspelling of airline names (Ruinair, EZjet, etc) throughout the book.  I'm 
not quite sure why he had to do it, maybe he was afraid of a lawsuit or maybe there are some funky EU laws that 
made him change them, but it seemed rather odd to me.  He also seems to be a little dusty on his facts sometimes, 
especially regarding Southwest Airlines. (NYSE:LUV)   He mentions that Southwest requires you to pay for food 
and drink (uh, no) and that Southwest doesn't compete with other airlines, just train transportation.  Sounds to me 
like he picked up a book about Southwest from 1985 and has missed the fairly significant changes since then.But 
those are nits, because they are not central to the book.  The author's snarky and dry sense of humor worked well.  
My Book Report on Ruinar
("In the recently upgraded Galleria lounge a glorious Bentley GT is parked centre stage. . . .  'Would you like a car 
like this?' he asks.  Talk about asking a bleeding obvious question.  It's Â£200,000 plus. 'Nah, I already have 
one.'")And yes, it even works when he's taking his potshots at Americans.  For example, "Only 20 per cent of 
Americans possess passports so we must be grateful for small mercies . . . ."  Oh but don't worry, he's an equal 
opportunity insulter.  "Greeks are dark, short, stocky, squat and hirsute.  And that's the ladies."A warning for those 
of you like me who are not very familiar with Irish pop culture:  he has plenty of references that leave me running to 
Google to figure out what he's saying.  "Much like the duck at Fawlty Towers I suspect one can have tripe with 
orange sauce, tripe with cherry sauce, or tripe surprise."  Now, I've heard of Fawlty Towers, but that's about as far 
as my knowledge goes.  Jokes like this are completely lost on me, but it's easy to read beyond them.As I said, 
when he's writing the chapters on his country trips, it's really a fun read.  Yes, there are some helpful travel tips, 
"Never eat in a restaurant with a multilingual menu.  Never eat in a restaurant with pictures of the food on the place 
mats. . . ."  I couldn't agree more.  He also apparently shares my love of Mars bars (the European kind without nuts, 
not the second class US version), but there are a couple of times he strays into oddly serious territory.  His chapter 
on the Jewish Museum in Berlin and the horrors of the holocaust seemed out of place with its humorless (obviously) 
and dark tone.  It didn't belong in this book.Toward the end, it seemed like the author had a set number of pages to 
fill but ran out of content.  There are a good 25 pages of material copied straight from the internet.  Online reviews 
of the airline at            Skytrax, a note from the            PPrune board, and an excruciatingly-painful description of a       
     video on YouTube left me skipping further to find more of what I couldn't find for free online.In the end, I enjoyed 
the read.  The author certainly has a love-hate relationship with Ryanair, and it's one that I think many people feel 
all over Europe.  The airline will get you there cheaply and mostly on-time, but when things go wrong, it can be an 
ugly experience if you're not prepared for it.  It's worth picking up a copy.  addthis_url    =

   Jun. 20, 2008 (Plane Buzz delivered by Newstex) --  Just another Michael O'Leary story for a Friday 
afternoon.O'Leary, the always chatty and usually controversial Chairman and CEO of Ryanair recently gave an 
interview in Germany where he talked about how Ryanair might set up a new trans-Atlantic operation. He said that 
the new service would definitely be two-class, as there would always be a market for those higher-priced seats.So 
in "Economy [class] it will be very low fares, but in business class it will be beds and blow jobs," O'Leary calmly 
explained.His German translator, clearly somewhat unnerved, then explains that she can not come up with a proper 
German equivalent of "blow job." Whereupon O'Leary makes a crack about how the Germans must have a terrible 
sex life.Hey, as I said, it's Friday. I think we all need a cold beer. Or two. Don't you? technorati tags start Technorati

   Jun. 18, 2008 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) --  Stay with me here.  Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's fearless 
leader and king of publicity, has announced his plans for a transatlantic airline.  And yes, it will apparently include 
blowjobs.His plan?  A bunch of economy class seats that will sell for 10 euros or something really cheap like that as 
well as a business class that'll run you 4,000 to 5,000 euros.  Why would you pay that much?  "Beds and blowjobs."  
Now THAT's a value proposition.  Don't believe me?  Watch for yourself (sorry, but the video is blowjob free):
Click here if you can't see the videoI'm actually surprised that he gets that you need to have a premium cabin to 
make this work, but it's his spin on the product that makes this blogworthy.  Will it happen?  Probably not, but he'll 
get all kinds of people to write about it.  Heck who knows if he'll ever get this thing off the ground at all, but who 
cares? 
 
Just 
watching 
his 
translator 
squirm 
is 
worth

  Jun. 3, 2008 (DealBreaker delivered by Newstex) --            Losses Push Lehman To Weigh Raising New Capital 
(WSJ) Lehman is expected to report losses in a couple weeks, and WSJ reports that in conjunction with this, the 
company may announce a raise of $3-$4 billion. From this timing, the report surmises that the loss will be worse 
than expected. Currently analysts expect a loss of around $300 million. It's not obvious to us that plans for a large 
capital raise necessarily relate to surprisingly weak earnings... though it's also possible that the report has heard 
hints of a very weak quarter (why not, seeing as they've already been made privy to sensitive info), and is trying to 
inject that possibility orthogonally.  
Grasso's Grit May Win After All (NYT) Wait, the Grasso pay package case? This nonsense isn't over yet. What's 
next, are you going to tell me there's still some Enron-related stuff in the courts? Of course not.            Oh Wait! 
Anyway, back to Grasso. With Spitzer gone and the whole story kinda faded from memory, Grasso doesn't have all 
kinds of negative headlines to deal with.            Soros Says Sell (Infectious Greed) Just a heads up (mainly to the 
daytrime crew at The 'Breaker). Soros is apparently testifying today in front of the Senate, where he will argue on 
the "oil is a bubble" side of things.            FT has more on what he'll be saying, including his argument that investing 
in energy via index funds is a problem. Gosh, would love the irony if lawmakers commenced a war on index funds.       
     Ryanair prepares to raise prices (FT) Ryanair, popular among frugal travelers and airplane nerds will be forced 
to raise prices to cope with rising oil prices. After turning in record profits last year, the company's earnings will 
plunge to "only" break-even this year, which a lot of other airlines would be really jealous of. In addition to the fare 
hikes, there's also a company-wide pay freeze. While we're big fans of Ryanair (in theory), and its aggressive 
approach to capitalism and competition, we're not entirely convinced by it. For all the free-market rhetoric, the 
company has been accused of taking subsidies from the small airports it serves (that issue may have been resolved 
at this point, though last we heard, the charge made a lot of sense).   Newstex ID: DEBR-0001-25716417

  May 27, 2008 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) --  Ruinair by Dubliner Paul Kilduff remained solidly planted 
as the number one bestselling nonfiction book in Ireland for its first seven weeks of publication. It has since gained 
in popularity throughout Europe, and for obvious reason. 
Kilduff's humorous account of traveling on Ryanair and other low fares airlines throughout Europe should resonate 
with anyone who has ever taken advantage of the low prices offered by no-frills airlines.Shameless knock-offs of 
the hugely successful American mainstay, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) , these European cousins seem to be 
holding their own, both to the joy and chagrin of their customers, who clearly favor the low fares offered yet relish 
the opportunity to gripe about their lack of specialized service, their high fees, and other pitfalls. As Kilduff advises 
in his book, one must be prepared to travel the low-budget way, and he provides many helpful tips for doing so.The 
premise of the book is as follows: Stung by a ten hour delay and a &euro;300 fare to Spain on his native 'lowfares' 
airline, Dubliner Paul Kilduff plots revenge - to fly to every country in Europe for the same total outlay, suffering 
every low fares airline indignity. ...And all this on a cheap Irish airline led by a self-proclaimed 'obnoxious little 
bollocks', which flies from A to somewhere remotely near B, weighs baggage like gold, charges its passengers to 
check-in or for wheelchairs, sells them hangover cures and scratch cards, lands its aircraft at the wrong airport, 
takes court cases against its own pilots and doesn't even care if Kilduff shows up. On his miserly pan-European 
exploration he reveals the secrets of the new travel phenomenon favoured by one hundred million plus passengers 
annually. I found this book an enjoyable read, particularly as in-flight entertainment. However, I found myself 
disagreeing with or wanting to correct the notion of a few of the observations made by Kilduff. One example was in 
his recounting of an incident in which flight attendants held seats empty "for balance" on a Boeing (NYSE:BA)  737 
flight. Kilduff implies that it is a ploy by the flight attendants to keep seats available for their own gain. The fact of the 
matter is that, as crazy as it sounds, this is indeed a safety necessity with particular passenger numbers on Boeing 
airplanes, and it can be fact-checked and confirmed through the Boeing company.I did appreciate the blunt Irish 
humor throughout the book. Poking fun at tourists, business travelers, airport staff, and airline owners alike, Kilduff's 
slightly exaggerated descriptions of his many trips and misadventures illustrate all that is both worthy and 
deplorable about air travel as a modern means of transportation. As a frequent traveler myself, I cannot deny that I 
do sometimes feel like simple "self loading freight" following a cattle-call routine, and yet the world has never been 
more accessible at our fingertips with high-speed jumbo jets and airfares that make it possible for the average

  May 12, 2008 (Investopedia Advisor delivered by Newstex) -- It's been more than 60 years since the end of WWII, 
but it now looks like an air-war could once again erupt over the skies of Europe. This time however, the prize is not 
a military victory, but a financial one.Recently, Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief executive of Europe's largest 
budget airline Ryanair (Nasdaq: RYAAY ), announced that his airline would be halving ticket prices. The 
announcement comes at a time when soaring oil prices are squeezing margins for the global airline business, 
prompting bankruptcies of several regional carriers in the U.S. and forcing the proposed  merger  of Delta (NYSE: 
DAL ) and Northwest Airlines (NYSE: NWA ).If it follows through, Ryanair's move could prompt a devastating fare 
war in Europe that could knock some of Ryanair's competitors out of the skies. One possible victim could be 
Germany's second largest carrier, Air Berlin. (For further reading on competition, read  Competitive Advantage 
Counts  and  Economics Basics .)Weaker U.S. Dollar Helping RyanairThe strategy is not with risk to Ryanair; it's 
highly vulnerable to rising fuel costs itself. It recently went on record that it would not be tacking on a fuel surcharge 
to its ticket prices despite the fact that it currently has no fuel price hedges in place. However, well timed currency 
transactions designed to take advantage of the U.S. dollar's decline against the euro have helped the company 
offset higher fuel costs. While it reports its revenues in  euros , about 60% of its costs for items such as planes, 
insurance and fuel are denominated in dollars. (To see how a rising or falling dollar can influence company profits, 
read  The Impact Of Currency Conversions  .)Hidden Aircraft Value Could Entice A Takeover O'Leary is also no 
stranger to reaping a huge payoff for the company from making bold and well-timed moves. In the wake of the 911 
attacks, when the global airline industry also faced considerable stress, he placed a massive order with Boeing 
(NYSE: BA ) for 100 new aircraft and  options  on 50 more at rock-bottom prices. Subsequent renegotiations and 
additions to the deal have increased the number to 150 planes on order, with options to buy another 70. Now that 
strong demand for planes has lifted prices significantly, analysts have now calculated that the deal provides Ryanair 
with a hidden value of $3.6-4.1 billion, giving it a  break-up value  of $8.5 billion, which is $2.6 billion more that its 
current market value. Numbers like that have prompted a degree of speculation about the company being a 
potential  takeover  candidate, with a private equity player the most likely suitor. (To learn more, read  Trademarks 
Of A Takeover Target .)The Bottom LineSo far this year, Ryanair shares have lost about one-third of their value, 
roughly in line with the declines faced by the rest of the industry. The selloff had, in part, been triggered by company 
predictions that a "perfect storm" of higher fuel costs, declining traffic levels and falling fares could slash profits by 
as much as 50% in the fiscal year ending March 2009. Now that it has fired a first shot in a potential fare war, you'd 
Ryanair Launches Air War In Europe
have to assume that a sharp decline in profits this year is now a dead certainty. However given ample warning, its 
now likely that shares are fully discounting that outcome. What they may not be discounted at this point is the 
enormous strategic gain that Ryanair could reap if it wins its European air offensive. That, plus the company's 
(below market) value to a potential acquirer, could see the stock regain some altitude from its currently depressed 
level.At the time of writing Eugene Bukoveczky did not own shares in any of the companies mentioned in this

  Apr. 17, 2008 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- 
The Mile-High Club has two new members: Delta (NYSE:DAL)  Airlines and Northwest Airlines. (NYSE:NWA)  The       
     two merged April 15th with a handshake. Merger and a handshake. Isn't that romantic? Sounds more like a 
combo meal offered by a house of ill repute.  
The Wall Street Journal calls it a            marriage. A marriage in Deliverance, maybe. Those in the know suggest 
United and Continental are standing in the lavatory line waiting patiently for the light to blink "vacant."  
Now for the screw: The merger likely means higher ticket prices, fewer places to go, and -- in defiance of all 
physical law -- even more cramped seating. 
           Ryanair can fly you about 960 miles from Frankfurt, Germany to Belfast, Northern Ireland for $68.            
Delta will fly you 48 miles less than that, from Phoenix, Arizona to Denver, Colorado for $165 more -- and that price 
is about to go up by 22 percent, from $233 to $284. United comes in at $231 - $163 more than Ryanair; and 
Continental is charging.            American Airlines can come in at $198, but that's still $130 more than Ryanair. 
Before long, AA will be charging about $241.  
More disconcerting than the cost (differences and forecasted raises) is the flagrant lack of customer service hoisted 
upon, I mean offered to the flier. Airlines in the United States can talk all the trash they want; there has been a 
noticeable decline in how customers are regarded.  
To be fair there's also been a rise in the number of people too uncivilized to take a walk, much less a flight, but can 
they not be filtered out along with all the tiny vials of Listerine? I've seen trouble customers make trouble as soon as 
they entered the airport, but for some reason their behavior was tolerated as if the airline employees all suffered 
with battered woman syndrome. Many an incident has necessitated airport security meeting the arriving flight -- and 
the offender still gets to fly again. What's that about?  
I've flown every one of these airlines -- and Ryanair never lost my luggage, treated me like a terrorist, balked at a 
request for one more snack packet, or            threw a fit over a breastfeeding mother. 
When my teenaged daughter became sick in the middle of the plane on our way from Frankfurt, Germany to 
Shannon, Ireland, Ryanair's flight attendants acted like mothers themselves. Contrarily, when a baby across the 
Those Incestuous Airlines
aisle from us became ill on a Delta flight, you'd have thought the child had opened the gates to hell the way the 
flight attendants chastised the young mother -- and did nothing to assist her.  
Is this apples and oranges -- or is there another explanation why the little airline that, proportionately, goes more 
places and is paying more for fuel than the bigger airlines is charging less for tickets and being more civil to its 
customers?

  Apr. 14, 2008 (Accidental Hedonist delivered by Newstex) -- No trips planned. I'm back in Seattle, and back at 
home and "regular" life. *sigh* So in the tradition of Harper's Weekly, I give you the following metrics and 
summation of the four weeks of travel: Miles Traveled: 18900 (approx) Airports: 13 Worst Airline: Ryanair. The 
cheap costs of their flights are defrayed by a very limiting baggage policy, and excessive fees if you exceed their 
limits. Best Airline: I was really surprised by West Jet Hotels: 13 Scariest Hotel: Executive Inn in Louisville - Straight 
out of the seventies, and not in a good way. Best Hotel: Culdearn House in Grantown-On-Spey. Small, cozy, great 
food. And the host was friendly as he could be. Most Underated Hotel: We loved the Lord Nelson in Halifax. Rental 
Cars: 6 Rental Cars Damaged: 1 Number of cans of Shoe polish purchased to cover damage: 1 Times trapped in a 
Parking Garage: 2 Amount of Times lost: 7 Of those time, amount due to GPS failure: 4 Number of times driven on 
the wrong side of road: 2 Cups of Coffee Consumed: 30 Cans of Sugar Free Red Bull Consumed: 18 Best 
Breakfast: Culdearn House, and their Traditional Scottish Breakfast. Worst Breakfast: Radisson Buffet in Windsor, 
Ontario. It's likely that I got food poisoning from a smoked salmon. Best Meal: I'll go with the most memorable - The 
great Haggis we had on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, at a place whose name escapes me at the moment. 
Distilleries visited: 24 Most Difficult Distillery to locate: Forty Creek (wrong google directions) Most Scenic Distillery: 
Glenfiddich - It's a great location with a ruined castle nearby. Woodford Bourbon was also quite stunning. Glasses 
of Whisky Consumed on trip: 120 (approx) Brands tasted: 110 Oldest Whisky Consumed: 63 years old Youngest: 2 
minutes Worst Tour: Jameson (Dublin) - Not a tour so much as a model of what their site used to look like. The 
Jameson folks have also seemed to have hired disinterested tour guides, making the entire process seem like a 
sales pitch to get you to their gift shop. Best Tour: Woodford Distillery was one of the more informative tours we 
had. The George Dickel tour we found to be quaint and fun due to the tour guide. Most interesting Characters: God, 
there were so many. John Teeling of Cooley had us laughing almost non stop. Dennis Malcolm of Glen Grant was 
the most charming, and John Hall of Forty Creek was the most thoughtful, both to us and how he views whisky. I 
could list everyone here tho. George Grant, Roger Brashear, Larry Kass, Dan Tullio - all were an exceptional help. 
Best Whisky Shop: The Whisky Castle in Tomintoul, Scotland. Mike Drury and his wife Cathy were both funny, 
engaging, and helpful. Best Whisky Moment: Having Brian Quinn at Locke's Distillery serve us the 63 year old was 
up there, as was drinking the 25 year old Glen Grant whilst overlooking their creek on the old wooden foot bridge. 
Drinking a whisky equal my age at Glenfarclas was also extraordinary. I can't pick just one moment. Biggest 
Surprise: Canadian Club's embracing their Prohibition Past. Sure it can be seen as a marketing tool at this point, 
At Long Last Home - A Distillery tour summation
but it's great to see them embrace their place in history (both Canadian and American). All you need to see is the 
bullet hole in the wine cellar to understand that. Additionally, they have a really great location (off of the Detroit 
River, which is prettier than it sounds), and I liked their whisky more than several of the bourbons and Scotches I've 
tried. Brands and companies I'm now interested in more than before: Forty Creek, Buffalo Trace, George Dickel, 
Cooley, Glenfiddich. (Note: I only rated the tours where the sites where no one knew why we were there. We visited 
several locations that were quite remarkable thanks to the help of PR folks and brand managers.)

Looks like Ryanair's upgrade went well, and the site even came back up a day early.  When I read through the            
page describing the benefits of the upgrade, one thing stood out.
You can now check-in for your flight online up to 5 days in advance of travel.  If both your flights happen to be within 
5 days, you can check in for both of them.  Interesting.
It used to be that if you had checked in for a flight with most airlines, you were somewhere in the airport.  Gate 
agents could be pretty sure that if they showed a certain number of people checked-in, they could expect them to 
show up, unless they were on a delayed connecting flight.  Even then, it was easy for the agents to predict how 
things would go.  That was really helpful on oversold flights.
But then people started having the ability to check in from home.  All of a sudden, people could show up as 
checked-in, but they could have been stuck in traffic or had a last minute change of plans so there was a better 
chance they wouldn't show up.  It made it harder to predict how full an aircraft would be.
Now, you can check yourself in 5 days prior to your flight.  Imagine all the things could happen in that time?  Yet 
now, people will check in 5 days in advance on Ryanair, because it's still first come, first serve seating.  So, even if 
you think your plans might change, you're not going to take a chance that you get stuck with a late boarding 
number.  So they can expect even less certainty.
This makes me think.  What's the point of having you check in at all?

If you need to book a ticket, change your ticket, or view your reservation on Ryanair in the next few days, you better 
hurry up.             Starting tonight (Friday, Feb 22) at 10pm GMT (11pm on the Continent), Ryanair will            
completely shut down its booking engine while it upgrades it.  The site won't come back up until Monday, Feb 25 at 
11p GMT.  During that time, you won't be able to:
Make a booking online
Make any changes to an existing booking online
Review your flight itinerary online
Check-in online for any flight (fees will be waived to check-in at the airport)
Get any information from Ryanair - they're shutting down their call centers the whole time
I have to say, I can't remember ever seeing a system upgrade go like this before.  Knowing Ryanair, this was 
probably the cheapest way to do the upgrade, so they signed on to just shut everything down.  Hopefully when it 
comes back up, they'll have better luck than other airlines who have recently tried to upgrade.  Keep your fingers 
crossed, and if you're traveling this weekend, get there earlier than normal to deal with the long lines that are likely 
to occur.

If you are wondering why your favorite stock (and hey, today it doesn't even need to be an airline stock) is glowing 
red and not green this afternoon as you check your online portfolio, there's one big reason.
The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) report which was released this morning, was worse than bad. It was 
dreadful.
The ISM reported today that its index of service sector business activity declined to 44.6 in January from a revised 
reading of 54.4 in December.
Economists surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected a slight slowdown but had still forecast growth, with a 
median estimate for the index of 53.
As with a number of economic indexes, a reading above 50 usually indicates expansion of the economy, while a 
number below 50 indicates contraction.
As if the drop was not newsworthy enough just because of its sheer amount, this also marked the first time the 
service sector reading has contracted below 50 since March 2003.
Dow Closes Down More Than 350 Points On Dismal ISM Report
"This is an absolute collapse of this index," Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at Global Insight told CNBC.
So now that we know the big story, how about the things with wings? How did they fare specifically?
Not so good.
Of all the airline stocks we track, only five posted a gain for the day. And the extent of those gains were nothing to 
get excited over. Those stocks  Continental, American Airlines (AAR)  (AMR) , Alaska, Allegiant and Ryanair.
And oil prices? Crude closed today at $88.41 -- down about $1.61.

  Feb. 4, 2008 (Wall Street Greek delivered by Newstex) --            
(Stocks in this  N SPY,  DIA,  QQQQ,  ADM,  HUM,  GOOG,  MSFT,  YHOO,  WAG,  WEN,  RYAAY,  SDS,  QID,  
QLD)
Tension is already mounting regarding Thursday's scheduled European Central Bank decision. While the Bank of 
England is widely expected to cut its target interest rate a quarter point or more, the ECB faces a less obvious 
economic decline with plainly apparent inflation.
In the U.K., housing issues similar to ours and economic decline leave the Bank of England with a clear decision. 
However, the ECB has a 3.2% inflation rate to contend with, and Jean-Claude Trichet is on record showing 
concern. But when the U.S. Federal Reserve views the economic situation so dire to cut the Fed Funds Rate by 
1.25% in eight days, can the ECB justify such a contrary or at least passive action as keeping rates steady?
Challenger Job-Cut Report
Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that planned layoffs reached 74,976 in the month of January, representing a 
19% year-over-year increase. What's more concerning to us is the 69% increase in layoffs since December of 
2007. Despite fiscal stimulus, we continue to expect retailers to post depressing fiscal Q4 results starting this 
month. On Thursday, most retailers will post same-store sales for January, and all indications are that growth has 
declined dramatically. The weekly figures posted by the International Council of Shopping Centers have shown 
same-store sales generally running between 1-2%, and the rate is deteriorating.
Consumer spending softness should lead retailers to post poor results this quarter, and to announce even more 
depressing fiscal '09 (Jan.) guidance. As a result, we expect the more proactive of corporate management teams to 
announce store closures and workforce reduction. We expect the retail environment, as well as the restaurant and 
Morning Report: Giant ECB Decision Ahead
other consumer sensitive industries, are saturated in light of the recessionary environment we believe the economy 
has already entered. The Challenger Report offered no reason to doubt this view.
Asia Catches Up
Last week, Asian markets mostly declined as a monster storm battered China. This morning the Shanghai B Class 
shares of Mainland China recovered their entire loss of last week in one fell swoop. Still, this occurred even as the 
World Bank cut its '08 GDP growth forecast for China to 9.6% from 10.8%. World Bank stated that China's 
burgeoning domestic demand should keep the country's growth robust despite global economic softening. This is a 
view we've come across on more than one occasion. Still, we remind the mathematically inclined of the significance 
of change and rate of change. Also, the unsophisticated Mainland market remains at risk to unforeseen events. We 
are probably nearly reaching the time to look for value in emerging markets and avoid momentum plays in the 
sector. For now though, we suspect a portion of panicked 401K flows out of U.S. stocks are finding the portfolios of 
well-promoted emerging funds that have strong past performances. Thus, fund flows could continue to support the 
emerging markets in the near-term, but eventually the news of global slowdown should reach Main Street as well.

     comments           disagreeing that it is the PR disaster I'd characterized it as. Whether it is or not (and I think it 
is), let's try this one on for size. 
 Today, budget Irish airline            Ryanair is in the public dock accused of crossing the boundary of taste with a 
provocative press ad to promote its latest low-price flight offer. The ad in question is shown here, courtesy of a            
BBC report. That report says advertising regulator the            Advertising Standards Authority received 13 
complaints from readers who found the ad [...;] after an investigation, the watchdog ruled the advert breached the 
advertising code's rules on social responsibility and decency. 
[...;] The ASA told Ryanair to withdraw the advert and ensure its future promotions complied with the advertising 
code. See the ASA's            adjudication report for the details. But the airline has refused to comply,  
[...;] "It is remarkable that a picture of a fully-clothed model is now claimed to cause 'serious or widespread offence', 
when many of the UK's leading daily newspapers regularly run pictures of topless or partially-dressed females 
without causing any serious or widespread offence," said Peter Sherrard, head of communications for the airline. 
"This isn't advertising regulation, it is simply censorship. This bunch of unelected self-appointed dimwits are clearly 
incapable of fairly and impartially ruling on advertising."  
Mr Sherrard added that Ryanair believed the advert was not irresponsible nor offensive and would therefore "not be 
withdrawing this ad" and would "not provide the ASA with any of the undertakings they seek". Sherrard's first point 
has some validity. Pick up any edition of a paper like The Sun, Daily Mirror or, best/worst of all, The Daily Sport, 
and you'd undoubtedly agree. 
Yet I think that's a pretty weak and ineffectiveness defence as you're not comparing like with like. It also displays a 
little arrogance where some humility might go down  referring to the regulator as a "bunch of unelected self-
appointed dimwits" is hardly going to get you much sympathy. 
The key point to me is the ASA's view that Ryanair's ad breaches not only the code of advertising practice but also 
that of social responsibility. You don't agree, Ryanair, so what do you see as your social responsibility? 
Meanwhile, the three newspapers which ran the ad have themselves said they will not run it again. They seem to 
understand what social responsibility means. Is this a PR disaster for Ryanair? The ad itself is one thing; how 
Ryanair's PR disaster
Ryanair has responded to complaints and criticism is another. They're on a pretty            sticky wicket with this. So 
it looks like it could be.          2008 - visit the            author for more great content.            >

  Jan. 28, 2008 (Samizdata delivered by Newstex) -- Patrick Crozier and various others, of whom I am one, continue 
to put stuff up at            Transport Blog from time to time (although my contributions are not always            very 
profound). One of the more interesting Transport Blog items of recent weeks has been this            recorded 
conversation in which Samizdata's own Michael Jennings talks with Patrick Crozier about low cost airlines.            
Says Patrick: "           Here's my favourite bit." This favourite bit is worth quoting in  J There was an airline named 
ValuJet which flew a plane into the Everglades and everybody on that plane was killed. Now this sort of put a 
damper on the discount airlines of the US, because ValuJet was the second largest discount airline in the US at that 
point after South West, and it got out ... once there was an investigation into this crash, it turned out that ValuJet 
had cut costs in all kinds of places, and in particular they'd simply neglected safety. And because the fact that this 
one discount airline in the US had done terribly bad things with respect to maintenance, discount airlines in the US 
didn't grow as fast after that as they probably would have if this crash had not happened. 
 It's interesting that that does sort of put a kibosh on the profits-before-safety argument. If you try to put profits you 
lose the safety, and if you lose the safety you lose the profits.  The interesting thing which came out of that was that 
discount airlines in other parts of the world really, really learned a lesson from that. Discount airlines in Europe, in 
particular RyanAir, which is ... one of the most ferocious cost-cutting companies I've ever seen of any kind ... it 
doesn't skimp on maintenance. The lesson was learned that whatever you do, you do your maintenance properly, 
because if you do skimp on maintenance and a plane crashes that will be the end of you, basically. 
One of Patrick Crozier's relentless Transport Blog memes is that safety and profit are not alternatives; they go hand 
in hand. As he says            here in connection with railways, where exactly the same equation  ... crashes are 
expensive. You lose the train, you lose passenger revenue through delays and cancellations and you probably 
have to rebuild the track. As            a rail executive once said: "Even a minor derailment or a collision can cost a 
fortune. I mean millions." No wonder Patrick was glad to hear Michael saying a similar thing not just about airlines, 
but in particular about cheap airlines. 
My favourite bit is where, reflecting on the impact on low cost aviation of the Second World, Michael  There are 
probably more airstrips in East Anglia than there are in all of China. It's not so much that I never knew that as that it 
had never occurred to me to even think about it.

  Jan. 4, 2008 (Plane Buzz delivered by Newstex) -- It's another chilly morning here at the PlaneBusiness 
Worldwide Headquarters.
>
>           >>No, that's not actually the Worldwide Headquarters, that is the Ice Hotel in Jukkasjarvi, Sweden.
>But hey, after four mornings of sub-freezing temperatures in this part of the world, it's a fair equivalent. Kind of. At 
least the four-legged members of our staff think so. Their forays outside have been, let us say, minimal. To say the 
least.
>Later today, subscribers to PlaneBusiness Banter will get to read their latest issue. This week we'll do our usual 
review of the latest DOT operational stats, we take a look at the capital structures of the major airlines we track -- as 
of the end of the third quarter. We'll also go into much more detail concerning the huge drop in airline shares over 
the last quarter, and particularly the last month.
>I'll post one or two of those airline stock performance charts in here next week if you guys behave yourselves 
between now and then. My New Year present to you.
>Meanwhile, that story continues to be written -- as they say -- as today the airline sector is taking yet another 
major body blow.Â 
>The airlines taking the biggest hits this morning?
>Shares of ExpressJet are being hammered. Shares here, as of this posting, are down 6.3%, to 2.23.
>Shares of United are not having a good day either, down 5% to 30.33.
>Shares of Mesa, which we noted here yesterday were the sector's biggest loser, are now down 3.4%, down to 
2.59, although shares were as low as 2.29 earlier in the day -- the lowest price level in 17 years, according to            
MarketWatch.Â >JetBlue is not having a good day either. Shares here are down 4%, at around 5.21, while shares 
of Frontier are down 5.5%, down to 4.85. Shares of US Airways are down 4% to 12.24 as of this posting.
>Two foreign flyers are having an awful day as well so far this Friday.
>ADRs of GOL are down almost 8% to 21.63, while shares of Ryanair are not having a ducky day either, as ADRs 
here are currently trading down 5% to 34.60.
Good Morning! Is There An Airline Bankruptcy in Your Future?
>I hate to ruin your mid-morning snack, but if economic conditions continue to push in the same direction they are 
pushing now, jet fuel continues to wobble around record highs, and market valuations of airlines continue to drop 
like rocks -- the issue in the next six months for this industry is not going to be consolidation. It's going to be 
survival.
>I look for us to hear about at least one major deal in the industry this month, and we may also hear about at least 
one other smaller one.
>As for Chapter 11 filings, I think SkyBus is in trouble. They are holding a $20 fare sale -- and remember -- this fare 
level would be in addition to their "guaranteed" bank of $10 seats on every plane.
>The airline had a horrendous Christmas season -- with many operational difficulties and many unhappy 
customers.
>This $20 fare sale the airline just announced? Familiar with the phrase, "Must raise cash?"
>And hey, while we are dragging out phrases from the "Airline Bankruptcy Primer" remember the term, "pre-
packaged bankruptcy?"
>I would not be surprised if we don't already have one of those sitting on the shelf. Or if it is not already on the 
shelf, an older version that was on the shelf is in the process ofÂ  being edited now to reflect changed conditions.
>Any bets as to which airline I'm talking about?
>I'll give you a hint. They fly lots of airplanes that go through a lot of jet fuel.
>And a pre-packaged bankruptcy would be one way to make all of those airplanes go away. Rather quickly.
>It would also do other things.
>We'll see, but I'm afraid, unless economic conditions dramatically improve (and PBB subscribers know I am in full 
Ratty Old Bear Suit regalia on that question) -- we are looking at a dramatically difficult six months ahead in this 
industry.

  Oct. 24, 2007 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- It's been awhile since I've checked in on Skybus, but I 
figured their            announcement that they're finally opening a new base (in Greensboro) meant it was time to 
>There's actually been a lot going on with the airline's route network recently.  First, on September 20, they            
announced they'd start flying to Chattanooga, Milwaukee, Gulfport/Biloxi, and Punta Gorda.  Since most people 
probably don't know where most of those cities are, this definitely keeps with their plan of serving places others 
don't go very often.  (Ok, Milwaukee is an 
>In fact, Skybus will have the only commercial service at Punta Gorda, which is outside Ft Myers in Florida.  I 
mean, since when does Ft Myers need a reliever airport!?!  Surely it's because Punta Gorda is cheaper.  (Of course 
it is, and don't call me Shirley.)
>
The announcement on Sept 25 was more interesting to me.  That's when they said they'd fly their first non-
Columbus routes - Portsmouth (New Hampshire) to both St Augustine and Punta Gorda (Florida).  Looks like 
they're getting hooked on the Florida snowbird gravy train, and I can't say I blame them.  There's a lot of money to 
be had there, especially during the             >Then last week it            came out that the airline was going to start 
cutting back on some of its long hauls.  Bellingham and San Diego are disappearing while Burbank gets cut in half 
to only one daily flight.  Sounds like the long hauls aren't carrying their weight right now.  It could be lack of demand 
for those routes in general or it could be lack of demand for the tight, no-frills product that the airline offers over long 
periods of time.  I'd bet it's a combination of both.  So what are they doing with the planes that used to fly those 
>Well, this week we got the big news that they were going to open a new base.  Like Ryanair, they have "bases" 
meaning that they base a certain number of aircraft and crews in their largest operations.  To date, Columbus has 
been the only base, but now we have . . . Greensboro.
>
Airline dorks (and Greensboro/High Point/Winston-Salem residents) will remember that airport as the home of many 
failed airline experiments.  The grandest attempt was Continental's old low fare division, CALite, which opened up a 
Greensboro hub in the mid 90's, back when every airline thought that a low fare division was a good idea.  (United 
Skybus Expands, Then Contracts, Then Expands . . .
still hasn't figured out that it isn't.)  I actually remember flying through there once connecting from Baltimore to 
Atlanta on an old 737-100.  So what makes Skybus think they can 
>What I'm sure the airline sees is an airport that doesn't have much service at this point and is less than 100 miles 
away from both Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham.  If the fares are low enough, they're banking that they can fill the 
planes.  Besides, Greensboro is also one of the destinations they already fly from Columbus, so they have an idea 
of what demand is like.  It must doing well for them.
>
So what routes are they flying from 
>Besides Columbus, we once again have the Florida gravy train.  St Augustine, Punta Gorda, and Ft Lauderdale all 
get flights, and I bet they'll do well for them.  They're also serving Gulfport/Biloxi, another town that I bet will do well 
as the gambling mecca of the south.  (I don't think mecca is the right word for the place.)
>
After that it gets interesting.  Portsmouth (New Hampshire) and Chicopee (Massachusetts) both get flights.  I'm not 
convinced that those are going to generate much traffic at all, but I suppose we'll find out soon enough.  Then 
again, I have to think those will look like blockbusters compared to the last route they announced . . . 
>Now, I'm surprised that they can even make this flight happen.  Burbank has a short runway and that's a long haul, 
so I have to think that an A319 with 156 seats is going to have some weight restrictions.  But then again, they 
probably won't be able to fill enough seats to worry about that.  Delta (DAL)  can't even support a daily flight from 
Los Angeles to Raleigh/Durham (it's down to 5x weekly).  I would be amazed if Skybus can find enough demand to 
fill half this plane.
>
So this is a lot of change for the young airline.  On one hand, it's good to see that they aren't wedded to routes that 
simply aren't performing.  This capacity shift tells me that they probably are seeing success on some routes and 
they are realigning to better serve those 
>It's not entirely surprising to see the longer hauls not working out as well as they'd hoped.  I mean, it's a tougher 
sell to get people to stuff themselves into those tight seats for that long of a flight.  And those routes have less 
demand overall anyway, so it was a long shot to begin with.  It may mean we'll see less of them out here on the 
west coast until they decide to open a base for short haul flying out this way, but until then . . . there's always

  Sep. 20, 2007 (Slugger O'Toole delivered by Newstex) -- Hmmm...; curiouser and curiouser...; It seems Ryanair 
are powerless to call an EGM without Irish Government support, so now are            talking about resorting to law. 
Hmmm...; so that 25.1% stake (           retained by the state to protect key interests including landing slots at 
London Heathrow), what was that all about then?

  Sep. 17, 2007 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- I have to pick my car up from the shop tomorrow 
morning, so I thought I'd put my post up tonight instead.  It's amazing, but I actually do get email if posts don't go up 
at the usual time.  So, here you go . . . 
>You always hear misguided governments argue that they need to prop up failing airlines.  I'm not quite sure why 
that is, but combined with other government intervention (including the proposed passenger bill of rights which I 
don't support) this probably helps explain why this industry will never be healthy for long periods of time.  
Something that happened over the last couple of weeks will hopefully help governments understand why coddling 
isn't necessary.  (I can always dream, right?)
>
Fortunately for me, it involves the airline I love to hate . . .  Alitalia.  I            wrote a couple weeks ago about how 
Alitalia's latest turnaround plan would involve significantly slashing flights at its Milan hub and moving them to Rome 
instead.  Well, you know the government is freaking out about losing all that service in such a major city.  But guess 
what?  Where there's demand, other airlines will come in and fill in the

Ryanair said it'll come in with 12 planes based at the airport operating flights to 50 international and 10 domestic 
destinations within a couple 
>See, if there's enough demand for service, when one airline goes, another will follow in its place.  You argue that 
Ryanair doesn't have the same level of service as Alitalia?  True.  But if enough people want full service, you can 
bet other airlines will come in and fill the need.

This has happened time and time again.  Remember when Southwest set up shop at Chicago/Midway the day after 
Midway Airlines went under?  And how exactly did Atlanta end up being the biggest airport in the world after losing 
Eastern Airlines almost 20 years ago?  Delta (DAL)  and AirTran (AAI)  picked up the

  Sep. 4, 2007 (Slugger O'Toole delivered by Newstex) -- The Shannon [No] Show            may not be quite as over 
as it appeared, and I don't mean because of the            Fianna Fáil cumann in Co Clare.  Aer Lingus' largest 
shareholder (29.4 per cent), RyanAir, has ignored the official            response from the Aer Lingus management 
and gone over their heads            by "issu[ing] a notice to the stock exchange today of requisition under the 
Companies Act and Aer Lingus's articles of association."  It's an attempt to force Aer Lingus to hold the EGM that 
both the Aer Lingus management and Fianna Fáil definitely don't want to see held. [some            more so than 
others - Ed] Adds According to            this short reportUnder Aer Lingus' rule book and company law, any 
shareholder owning at least 10% of the airline has the right [to] convene a meeting at any time.And via            Irish 
Election we have the            actual requisition notice>

  Aug. 31, 2007 (Slugger O'Toole delivered by Newstex) -- Fine Gael leader            Enda Kenny's late arrival to the 
debate over Aer Lingus'            tranfer from Shannon to Belfast has been somewhat over-shadowed            by the 
annoncement by Aer Lingus that they have rejected RyanAir's            call for a Emergency General Meeting.  Both 
stories also get an airing            in this RTÉ report.  It doesn't change            the fundamentals underpinning            
the decision though.. but            whether any politician, our own local            variety included, will articulate that case 
rather than following a            locally populist, if non-sensical, line remains to be seen seems unlikely.

recent restructuring, GM confirmed a $891 mln rise in net income compared to a $3.4 bln year-ago loss, despite 
more charges for its former parts unit Delphi. SunMicro rallied after better than expected profits, as did Ryanair in 
Europe, while Wendy's Intl may be a takeover target. In the pharma sector, Glaxo rallied after Avandia was kept on 
the market by the FDA, while Alcatel-Lucent fell after posting a loss. Mortgage lender IndyMac net income sank 
57% amid subprime problems. See Dow, S&P and

  Jul. 13, 2007 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- First there was Southwest's Ding!, then there was 
Ryanair's Bing!, now there's . . . American's Dang!?  Enough with the ridiculous punctuation, please!*!@#)&*%)!!!
Ok, so it's not actually called Dang!, but according to            Sky Talk, some people internally referred to it as just 
that.  It's actually called            DealFinder.  So guess what it does?  Um, finds deals?  Right!
But it's not really much like Ding! at all.  There's actually more to it than that, and despite it's slowness on my 
machine, I still like what they're doing.  Like Ding!, DealFinder sits in your system tray, usually at the bottom right 
hand corner of your Windows-based computer.  You'll see a little AA logo there.  When you click it, you'll see the 
application come up on your screen.  It looks like 
           h1
The main part of the application is the "saved searches," which are nothing like Ding! and more like the            
Orbitz DealDetector.  You pick routes that you want to fly and set a maximum price.  It will alert you when you get 
below that level.  As you can see, my quick trip to Hawai'i for under $500 isn't looking likely, but the sub-$500 
Christmas run to Indianapolis is available now.
The other, potentially more interesting piece of this application is the RSS reader they've built in.  If you aren't sure 
what RSS is, this quick            summary from Wikipedia will help.  I know RSS readers are gaining in popularity, but 
I'd guess that many people who book travel at aa.com don't use them yet.  That's why this is a good idea.
First, they have feeds from American that offer deals and news from the airline.  That can be helpful, of course.  But 
you can also subscribe to your own RSS feeds in here.  As you can see, I subscribed to the Cranky Flier (great 
American Goes Dang!
blog, I hear) and it loaded my most recent posts on the left.  Just below the saved searches, you can see a small 
window that has the text of that post for you to read.
Now, this isn't a full-featured RSS reader.  You can't see pictures and it truncates long posts, so if you use Google, 
My Yahoo (YHOO) , or anyone else, this won't replace it well.  But if you don't have a reader, this could be a good 
way to get quick news updates, sports scores, anything else you might want to catch at a glance.
This may have nothing to do with American Airlines (AAR)  (AMR) , but that's why it's a good idea.  If American can 
get you checking the application for your news and sports throughout the day, that's more opportunity for them to 
get your attention and potentially get you thinking about taking a trip.  That's why I like it, because there are plenty 
of people who don't have an RSS reader and might find this to be an interesting way to get started with one.
So the RSS reader is nifty, but what is going to draw people in?  Low fares, of course.  If my Hawaiian trip still 
shows the same fares I can find anywhere else, I'm more likely to use Orbitz DealDetector, because at least then I 
can check other airlines as well.  But, if American starts telling you that they've found a low fare that you can only 
get through DealFinder, then it's going to do very well.
Can the airline do that?  I'd think that the GDS contracts might prevent them from posting fares there that they don't 
post with the reservations systems, but there could be a loophole.  If anyone knows more, please write a comment 
below.

managed (as Ryanair's are) and my belief that fewer passengers would mean shorter immigration queues proved 
wrong (the border control guys preserved the traditional line length by having just one person to do the stamping 
stuff) but it was fine. We got here, and stepped out into 119 degree sunshine. 
 On the way I read some more Jeremy Clarkson. Gosh, that guy is sound. If the Conservatives ran him for Mayor of 
London (or even Doncaster, his home town) he'd be a shoo-in. 
 Checking in to our hotel, we met some other FreedomFesters (if that's the right word). I don't suppose I'll ever see 
them again, because the football-field-sized hotel lobby is so crowded with neon slot-machines it's like a 
technicolour hall of mirrors and I'm lost.

  Jun. 9, 2007 (Adam Smith Institute blog delivered by Newstex) -- We wouldn't normally look to Michael O'Leary, 
the boss of and driving force behind Ryanair, to provide an insight into one of the less studied areas of economics. 
But he does provide a useful hint            here:He added he was likely to leave Ryanair "within the next two to three 
years, but it's a rolling date. I've always said when Ryanair gets large and very boring it needs a different set of 
skills to mine. I'm good at doing the loud-mouth and fighting everyone."In the standard texts far too little attention (in 
my humble view) is paid to the role of the entrepreneur, something O'Leary has just described, in innovation. Yes, 
large companies do, as William Baumol            has stated, make continuous improvements to their products and 
this does indeed drive technology forward. Yet there's a large difference between this and the "change an industry" 
leaps of faith that the entrepreneur offers. 
 People such as Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, O'Leary himself, are famously out of step with the received 
opinion on almost everything, until they become it, and there's as yet no really good account in economics (at least 
as far as I know) of the importance of all of this.
 Perhaps it's just that loud-mouthery and fighting everybody are difficult things to model, however essential they are 
to the continuance of human progess.

  Apr. 26, 2007 (http://www.crankyflier.com|The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- I?m guessing that most of you 
who read this blog know about Southwest?s ?           http://www.southwest.com/ding/|Ding!? application.  In short, 
you download a program that stays open on your computer.  If you?re connected to the internet, you will receive an 
alert when Southwest publishes special sale fares.  These can sometimes be up for only a couple of hours, and 
you?ll only be able to access them by clicking on a link in the application.  The last couple of weeks, Southwest has 
made a splash with a lot of $25 to $50 one way fares throughout the US and you could only find them on Ding!.
It?s a great program because it enables Southwest to keep in constant contact with its customers.  If they keep it up 
with compelling content, they have a very captive audience that acts like Pavlov?s dog any time they hear the ding 
alert.  So it was only a matter of time before others followed the same strategy.  I just didn?t know it would be such 
a 
blatant 
rip-off. 
 
Behold, 
Ryanair?s 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
http://www.ryanair.com/site/EN/feeds.php?partner=BING&view=email&pos=HEAD|Bing! application.
            http://www.flickr.com/photos/crankyflier/473694544/|/h1
Um, yeah.  It?s the one on the left, looking eerily similar to Ding! over on the right.  And it works the same way too.
           http://www.flickr.com/photos/crankyflier/473694546/|The application sits in your system tray (in your start bar 
on Windows) and then a little envelope shows up when deals arrive.  Click it and it opens those windows with a link 
to see the deals.
It?s definitely unreal how little effort Ryanair put into this thing in terms of creativity.  Nice work, Southwest, for 
creating a program others want to steal so badly that they can?t even be bothered to tweak it.

  Apr. 24, 2007 (http://www.crankyflier.com|The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- Head on over to            
http://www.skybus.com|Skybus.com and you?ll see the brand new website launched this morning.  (It?s been 
timing out on me a lot - not a good start.)  They?re now taking reservations, and true to their word, they?re going to 
be flying by the middle of May.  Initial promo fares start at $10 one way.  First, let?s look where they?re flying.
            http://www.flickr.com/photos/crankyflier/471278889/|/h1
All of these cities will be served from Columbus initially, though I really hope they get some non-Columbus routes 
going for their own sake.  Oh, but be careful.  In true Ryanair fashion, they?re serving nearby airports so this is a 
little misleading.  Here?s the actual lineup. As mentioned, all cities are served only from Columbus to start:
Burbank (Los Angeles) - once daily on 5/22, twice daily on 6/12
Portsmouth, NH (Boston) - twice daily on 5/22
Kansas City - once daily on 5/22
Richmond - once daily on 5/23
Bellingham (Vancouver/Seattle) - once daily on 5/29
Greensboro - once daily on 5/29
Ft Lauderdale - once daily on 5/29
Oakland (San Francisco) - once daily on 6/12
So now that the schedules are out, we can also talk about the product.  Everything that they?re doing is very 
consistent with the ultra low cost model, but it?s going to be a shock to a lot of travelers.
Skybus Launches
Check In - They recommend doing it at home, but there are also kiosks at the airport.  I?m guessing those are your 
only two options.
Baggage - You can bring one carry on and one personal item onboard for free, but all checked bags cost money.  
It?s $5 per bag for the first two and then $50 per bag after that.
Drinks/Snacks - You can NOT bring your own drinks and snacks onboard.  How else are they going to make money 
off of you?  You?ll have to pay onboard for any drinks or snacks you?d like to consume on the plane.  They aren?t 
picky about how you pay though.  All money is good whether cash or credit. Heck, they?re so desperate they?ll 
even take Diner?s Club.
Inflight Entertainment - None.  According to their            http://ask.skybus.com/about/rules-of-flying.shtml|Rules of 
Flying, you?ll have to bring your own.
Legroom - If you don?t have any entertainment to bring onboard, you can just count the threads in the seatback in 
front of you.  It?s going to be that tight.  Let me put it this way.  Those seats everyone whines about being too tight 
on United, US Airways (NYSE:LCC) , American, etc are usually at a 31? pitch (proxy for legroom).  Skybus will 
have 156 seats on their A319 aircraft.  EasyJet in Europe has the same layout and it offers a mere 29? pitch.  Tall 
people might want to rethink flying these guys.
Phone Reservations - None.  Seriously.  They don?t even have a phone number.  It?s all email if you can?t find 
what you need on the website.  I find that quite annoying personally.  I would hope that at some point they at least 
get an online chat function up and running.
Staffing - Not much.  They?re going lean here.  That?s why you won?t be able to check-in with an agent, and you 
won?t see gate agents at the gate until it?s time to board.
On Time - They say you have to arrive at least 30 minutes prior to departure or you won?t get on.  I wouldn?t mess 
with these guys on this.
Refunds - None.  Seeing a pattern here?  There?s a $40 change fee but nothing is refundable.  That?s not a bad 
deal, though if you bought a $10 ticket you?re better off throwing it away.
Pre-Boarding - If you want to pre-board, that?ll cost you $10.
As you can see, this is definitely a different way to fly.  I really hope that anyone who buys a ticket does their 
homework beforehand, because otherwise they?ll be in for a rude awakening when they get to the airport.
As far as I?m concerned, this is a great idea, but the key is on-time performance and route selection.  I think 
markets like Oakland and Burbank are great, but Greensboro and Richmond?  Hmm, not so sure, especially with 
156 seats to fill on every flight.  They?re going to need to get away from Columbus quickly and start moving into 
more markets that will support this type of service, but if they do it right, this could be big.

  Apr. 19, 2007 (http://www.crankyflier.com|The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- I believe Spirit?s 
transformation is now complete. Yesterday they launched what I believe is the first $0.01 sale they?ve run (it ends 
tonight).  I know they ran a $0.05 sale, but this could be the first time they?ve tried to prove that a penny isn?t 
irrelevant.  (Actually, it still is because you have to pay taxes, but I digress.)
So what do I mean by transformation?  Well, they used to be a low cost carrier that didn?t stand out from the pack.  
In the last year, they?ve basically stripped everything out of the fare that they can to become an ?ultra? low cost 
carrier.  Pay for checking bags, pay for drinks, pay for just about anything beyond your seat.  That?s how they can 
offer these $0.01 sale fares that Ryanair perfected long ago. While we?re at it, can you tell which one of these 
pictures is from the Spirit homepage and which is from the Ryanair homepage?
            http://www.flickr.com/photos/crankyflier/464746815/|/h1
Ok, so maybe the dollar sign vs. pound sign thing is a dead giveaway, but other than that, they?re pretty similar.  I 
hope they don?t get too comfortable down there in the basement because competition is coming.  Skybus is still 
working on certification and should be joining them shortly.

  Apr. 16, 2007 (Adam Smith Institute blog delivered by Newstex) -- Ryanair has announced that they plan to start a 
transatlantic service based on the same low-cost, no-frills model that has made it one of the World's most 
successful airlines. Other firms look set to follow. This is of course fantastic news and promises to vastly increase 
competition in this notoriously restrictive airline market.
 At present, only BA, Virgin, United and American are allowed to fly from Heathrow to the US and prices, especially 
in the business travel market, are extortionate. The break in this cosy little cartel came with the US/EU Open Skies 
agreement which was agreed two years ago and is due to come into force in July. Under this agreement, many of 
the restrictions on air travel are lifted and more open competition is encouraged. The results are already starting to 
show.
 With ticket prices starting at £7, exactly how Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary will manage to make this new 
business profitable is hard to see. But as the saying goes, if anyone can, he can.
 Better transport and communication links are vital for an expanding economy and so the next step must be to look 
for new ways to increase capacity in the system. More airlines flying out of Heathrow inevitably put more pressure 
on the already disgracefully overcrowded and dilapidated airport. Terminal Five, when it opens in 2008 will help to 
relieve the pressure but the ceaseless expansion of air travel means that sooner rather than later a third runway 
and a sixth terminal will be needed. 
 Needless to say, the biggest problem with the plans for expansion is the torturous planning process ahead. The 
public enquiry into Terminal Five was the longest in history and a new runway and terminal may face even more 
difficulties. Strangling this most vital of industries in the face of the benefits of improving competition is damaging to 
the British, European and American economies.

  Apr. 11, 2007 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- 
I saw this Skybus press release announcing their aircraft advertising program today and knew I had to blog about it.
In short, they are going to sell advertising on any white space they can find.  This includes the outside of the plane, 
overhead bins, tray tables, and restroom doors.  Nationwide Insurance is the first to do the outside, but I'm going to 
be the first to do the inside. . . .
Looks good, huh?  Hmm, maybe not.  I can hear all those naysayers cringing about this "horrible" development 
(onboard advertising in general, not the picture of my face specifically), but I say . . . bring it.  This is a great move 
for them.
Remember, Skybus is going to have ultra-low fares a la Ryanair.  That means you could see fares for a buck or 
even less (just speculating here).  The only way they can offer those low fares is if they can make money 
elsewhere.  Advertising is one great way to do that.  That's how all those free websites, including mine, make 
money.  (Side note:  Remember to use those Google links at the bottom of this post if you are genuinely interested 
so I can start paying to advertise on Skybus.)
Generally all those people who say this is a horrible thing are the same people who complain that airfare is too 
expensive these days.  Well, here's your tradeoff.  If you're willing to stare at an ad for awhile, you too can fly for 
cheap.Most airlines aren't going to match this, and they shouldn't.  The idea of paying for a better product in coach 
is something that hasn't really happened on a large scale in some time.  If you just want cheap, go ahead and 
shoehorn yourself into a tight seat and stare at ads all flight long.  Buy a cup of water if you want, but don't complain 
about it as long as you get there on time.  If you want more, then you'll have to pay more to fly on another airline 
that won't put ads up.
It's all about creating a value proposition that will appeal to different segments of travelers, and I think there is 
plenty of room for this type of the service at the bottom end of the pricing curve.

  Apr. 11, 2007 (Action Economics delivered by Newstex) -- Canada's S&P/TSX Composite has opened higher, up 
0.3% in early trading, helped by surging metal prices and M&A activity. Supportive of the materials sector, front-
month copper has jumped 2.5%, reaching a seven-month high. Meanwhile, spot gold has steadied at higher levels, 
holding near $678/oz. Elsewhere, front-month crude dipped below $62/bbl ahead of the EIA weekly inventory data. 
In M&A, Lundin Mining is set to acquire Tenke Mining in a $1C.4 bln stock-swap deal, extending recent 
consolidation in the sector. Meanwhile, Onex and Magna are working on a joint bid for Chrysler, according to the 
Globe and Mail. CAE is also in focus, after winning pilot training contracts with Ryanair and IndiGo. See our 
S&P/Toronto Composite technicals.

  Apr. 3, 2007 (The Cranky Flier delivered by Newstex) -- 
Skybus has said they plan to start flying around May 20 of this year.  Now, that's less than two months away and 
we know very little about this airline.  They've clearly taken the opposite approach of Virgin America here.  Instead 
of pushing everything out into the public eye, they're keeping it all very close to the vest.  So what can we figure 
out?
Well I believe they've said that the first routes will be out of their home base in Columbus (Ohio).  That makes 
sense, of course, but we don't know where those planes will go.  This YouTube video shows some test runs landing 
at Burbank airport, just outside of Los Angeles, last week.
So could we see Burbank-Columbus on the route map in the beginning?  Quite possibly.  I like the route, but if they 
do go with the "cram a ton of seats on the plane" strategy, I do wonder about how reliably the plane can make the 
flight nonstop from those short runways.
This Airliners.net thread also points to a proving run last week into Pease Airport (New Hampshire), about 50 miles 
north of Boston.  That's about the same distance as Manchester from Boston and a little closer than Providence.  
So, it's not a bad idea.  If they really do go with Ryanair style $1 fares (or less), they have a chance to draw traffic 
out there.

  Feb. 21, 2007 (Cato@Liberty delivered by Newstex) -- 
One of the benefits of tax competition is that there is a feedback mechanism that tells politicians they made a 
mistake. If taxes are too high in one jurisdiction, politicians lose money as economic activity shifts to another 
jurisdiction. The latest example of this liberalizing process comes from the United Kingdom. The Labour 
government just imposed new taxes on airline travel that will boost ticket prices by as much as $159 -- even if 
London is the hub for travel elsewhere. As the Wall Street Journal explains, this is good news for other nations 
since airline customers now are looking to use cities such as Amsterdam as their gateway to Europe:
 You may want to steer clear of London. Thanks to a new U.K. ticket tax that took effect February 1, passengers 
who fly into or through London airports will pay new taxes and fees that can add up to $159 to the cost of a ticket. 
This levy was the brainchild of Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and is being applied retroactively. So 
even if you bought your plane ticket last year, you'll get socked with the tax surcharge. The tax has infuriated both 
U.S. and British airlines, to say nothing of their passengers. "It's a major league headache for all our air carriers 
who fly to London and are trying to collect this retroactive tax," says Jim May of the U.S. Air Transport Association. 
A spokesman for British Airways (NYSE:BAB) , which has been struggling financially, calls the new tax "completely 
unfair." Ryanair's Web site describes Mr. Brown as "greedy Gordon" and his tax as "the great plane robbery." The 
new tax comes on the heels of other highly publicized problems at Heathrow, including a breakdown in the baggage 
handling system and security delays. Consumeraffairs.com reports that one consequence is that more and more 
American travelers are investigating Amsterdam as an alternative hub for discount flights in and out of Europe.

  Jan. 2, 2007 (EclectEcon delivered by Newstex) -- Courtesy of            Stephen Pollard, from the tag end of            
this piece in the Telegraph:
... a warning: I'm about to share something with you that may well distract you at inopportune moments in days to 
come, possibly while operating heavy equipment, possibly even this evening as you are counting down to midnight. 
It is this. I was travelling on South West Trains the other day when the announcement was made: "We regret to 
inform you that the buffet trolley is unable to come down the train as it is too wide for the aisles."
Think about it. Aisles must be a standard size. So must buffet trolleys. Was a batch of trolleys manufactured to the 
wrong specifications, then sent out anyway in the hope that no one would notice?
 My guess is that the buffet carts were ordered by the catering firm, not SW Rail, but there was probably a 
bureaucratic snafu at work here. Another possibility is that some employee in the catering firm got the carts mixed 
up. Even so it is funny.
My own experiences with the British rail system last summer were mostly good, but they were pretty bad at times. 
The worst example: I could buy a ticket online from southeast England to Scotland, but nowhere did the webpages 
inform me how to get a reservation for a specific seat. And once I arrived at the train, it was impossible to make a 
reservation. And the conductor did not seem to understand my confusion and frustration. Next time I'll probably just 
take RyanAir. Yes, there is serious competition in many of these transportation markets.

Last week, British officials foiled a terrorist plot to blow a commercial airplane to hell over the Atlantic Ocean. 
Yesterday, a West Virginia airport was evacuated after security officials detained a Pakistani woman with 
suspicious liquids in her possession. Today, we learned from a TSA spokesperson that the liquids tested positive 
for explosive residue. In addition, a British aircraft bound for Egypt made an emergency landing in Italy when the 
pilot reported that he suspected a bomb was on board. Earlier this morning, Indian authorities stationed over 100 
soldiers around the Taj-Mahal after an alleged al-Qaida letter threatened to blow it up. 
Now, we have some greedy, self-absorbed loony demanding that Britain eliminate its restrictions on carry-on 
luggage and liquids because these "bizarre" new policies have cost his company around 62m ($3.8m USD) since 
the London terror scare last week. If his demands are not met, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary claims he may sue 
the government for compensation, citing section 93 of the Transport Act 2000. This act obligates the Secretary of 
State to provide compensation to certain entities negatively affected by any new state-sanctioned policies enforced 
during a national emergency. O'Leary considers Ryanair one of those entities.
Ryanair prefers to have customers take more of their luggage on board with them in order to facilitate efficient 
passenger traffic to and from the planes, allowing flights to remain on schedule while maintaining low fares. 
Unfortunately, the British government has greatly inconvenienced O'Leary in its effort to protect passengers from 
suicide bombers.  According to BBC correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, Mr O'Leary was very concerned because 
the "new regulations are a threat to his business." 
"He depends on getting away fast, no baggage in the hold and a quick turn around at the other end. If he is kept 
behind schedule his whole business starts to suffer," she said. In a lame attempt to deflect the public's ire, O'Leary 
stated that "If they allow these restrictions to stay in place, then the government will have handed the extremists an 
enormous PR victory." So, lifting the restrictions is a better option? I'd rather watch a video clip of terrorists dancing 
Britian's Ryanair Airlines Demands Reduction in Airline Security
in the street with glee over their "PR victory" than watch the same clip imbedded in a news article depicting five 
plane wreckages.
Fortunately, the British government will probably not give into O'Leary's petty demands. A spokesman with Britain's 
Department for Transport stated that "We have no intention of compromising security levels nor do we anticipate 
changing our requirements in the next seven days."  I'll be very interested (and amused) to see how this case pans 
out.

Hey, it looks like everyone's favorite marijuana consuming pop culture icon, Snoop Dogg, still hasn't forgotten his 
gangsta roots. The rapper and his 30-strong posse are now banned for life from British Airways (NYSE:BAB)  after 
injuring 7 police officers and attacking BA staff members when Snoop posse members with coach tickets were 
refused entry into the VIP lounge:He is claimed to have screamed at staff and thrown bottles of duty-free whisky 
after his 30-strong entourage was refused entry to the British Airways lounge at Terminal 1. Only three were said to 
hold first-class tickets. All were subsequently refused entry to their aircraft and banned from travelling with BA. 
 [...] Airport staff claimed that a minder threw a policeman across a room as more than 20 officers tried to restrain 
the group. The entourage was reported to have been squirted with pepper spray before the 34-year-old rapper was 
arrested with five other men.
In a twist with just that extra bit of oddness, Snoop Dogg was bailed out of jail by Nelson Mandela's daughter. Cus, 
y'see, Snoop Dogg and posse were traveling through London to connect with a flight to South Africa, where they 
were to perform with Sean Paul and Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes. But there was to be no Snoop Dogg in 
J'burg, alas - He missed the concert due to his jail stay.

"Hello, sir, and welcome to Eos Airlines. Hips or lips?" I kid! Eos Airlines, the niche airline offering all-biz-class 
service between New York and London, had for some time offered an expedited, escorted check-in at curbside for 
passengers who were running late. The escort included a quick zip through security and everything. The popularity 
of the service has inspired Eos to offer it for all their passengers, meaning that any Eos ticketholder can swan in 
quite late -- cutting it as close as 45 minutes before takeoff -- and still make it comfortably onto the plane. I'm 
guessing they don't have to pay extra for snacks neither.

In last week's New Yorker, film critic and Londonphile Anthony Lane wrote a love letter to dirt-cheap European flight 
carrier Ryanair. Unfortunately, the article isn't available online -- which is a shame, since it demystifies many of the 
questions both Americans and Euros have had about the budget carrier, while simultaneously shedding light on the 
past, present, and future of Europe's econo airlines. We've already written about their price war with British Airways 
(NYSE:BAB) , flights to Trieste and Marrakech, and questionable safety standards before. But Mr. Lane loves 
Ryanair, and, to be frank, we do too. After the jump, we bring Anthony Lane's take on Ryanair to the non-New 
Yorker subscribing masses. (Also note the easter egg in the above picture: "Auf Widersehen Lufthansa" was a 
recent, trademark-assertive Ryanair marketing campaign.)
 In a Nutshell: Opening grafs dedicated to the author choosing a city via Ryanair service at random (Vitoria-Gasteiz 
in Spain's Basque Country) and flying there from London's Stansted airport. The flight took under two hours and 
cost, including taxes, under $40US; Vitoria-Gasteiz turned out to be a charming small city with a Basquiat and 
Kandinsky-filled art museum. Moreover, flights from Stansted and other hubs are similarly priced throughout Europe 
on no-frills planes (seats don't recline and are first come-first serve, customers pay extra to check non-carry-on 
luggage). Flights booked far in advance = dirt cheap, flights booked at the last minute = far less so. Airports near 
larger cities tend to be further out, while smaller cities like Leipzig and Baden-Baden offer airports within 10 minutes 
of the city center.
 The Planes and the Airports: "Ryanair runs a fleet of a hundred and three 737s of the most recent vintage." "The 
majority of budget destinations (some of them converted to civilian life after decades of military use during the Cold 
War) are more pleasantly placed. Rome Ciampino ... the poor relation of the city's principal airport, is wholly 
preferable, not least because the road trip into town takes you along the Appian Way, whose rickety stones shook 
the bones of Julius Caesar."
 Planning a Trip: "Reserving my flight to Vitoria-Gasteiz took less than three minutes. I went to the Ryanair web site, 
scrolled down to my destination ... At no point did I hold a physical ticket in my hand; seats are unallocated, so there 
is a stimulating last-minute scramble to the plane from the gate."
Flights: A Ryanair Primer
 The Ride: "[Seats are so cheap because] the airline would prefer to fill that seat rather than leave it empty, on the 
understanding that, once in plane you are a captive customer. The salesmanship on short flights is direct and 
unabashed, trusting that we will be overcome by the need to wear Glow, the new fragrance from J. Lo ... Should 
you feel hungry, it will charge you the amusing price of two euros ($2US.40) for a small tub of potato chips. Bottled 
water runs to five euros per litre."
 Why is Ryanair Expanding to So Many Cities?: "Local councils and businesses on the Continent have an even 
deeper desire to open their airports to Ryanair; because of business that tourists and entrepreneurs will bring, the 
airline is offered incentives -- in effect, subsidies -- to land at a particular airport. Board a flight to Balaton, a new 
Ryanair destination in Hungary, and you will reportedly find it crammed with property developers scouring for grand 
estates or other bargains which they can then refurbish."
 The History and the Guy in Charge: "Ryanair ... began shyly, in 1985, ferrying passengers from Waterford, Ireland, 
to London Gatwick. The aircraft were fifteen-seaters, so cramped that the cabin crew had to be shorter than five 
feet two." "Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair ... doesn't like planes. 'I am not a cloud bunny,' he has 
said. 'I am not an aerosexual.' [When asked] the function of an airplane? 'It's a bus.'"
 American Comparisons: Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)  to a degree. But ... "Fly an hour from Kansas City and 
you will find yourself under similar skies, with little need to alter your dress code, your diet, your speech, or your 
point of view. Fly the same distance from Geneva and you can wind up on the Mediterranean, chomping seafood in 
the shade."
 Why fly Ryanair?: "The seat cost me a dollar each way, plus taxes and airport charges. The tagliatelle al funghi 
that I ate for dinner that night was better, and more seductively yolk-yellow, than anything I could have ordered in 
Britain. And the plane landed ahead of schedule on both legs of the journey. Given these virtues, the question has 
to be: why travel any other way?"

That's Michael O'Leary (CEO of Ryanair) above, "larking about" in reaction to British Airways (NYSE:BAB)  
increasing its fuel surcharge by _65 per leg. We just don't often see nutty execs like this in the States. However, 
O'Leary probably wasn't quite so amused by BA's announcement that they're cutting regional Europe fares by as 
much as 50% in response to competition from discounters like Ryanair and Easyjet. For example, you can now fly 
on BA from London to Amsterdam for as little as _632 one way, which ain't bad at all.
