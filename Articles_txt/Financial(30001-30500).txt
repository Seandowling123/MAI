Body
Aer Lingus pilots spent close to E30m on shares in the airline at a price of E3.04 in attempt to block a takeover bid 
from Ryanair, it has been confirmed.
Newspaper reports this morning had suggested that the group of pilots had spent E24m on the shares, however, a 
statement to the Irish Stock Exchange revealed that the pilots bought just short of 10 million shares, bringing their 
stake in the flag carrier to just over 2pc.
This means that the Government and staff now own 42pc of Aer Lingus.
 Last week, Ryanair snapped up a 19.2pc stake but is prevented from buying any more shares until it raises its 
E2.80 per share offer. The pilots and other opponents believe that they can veto any bid from Ryanair by buying up 
as many shares as possible.

Body
The Government, with its 28pc share in Aer Lingus, has an effective block on any bid by Ryanair to take over the 
airline and merge it with its own operations, Finance Minister Brian Cowen told the Dail today.
Mr Cowen said that the State's share meant it could not be delisted from the stock exchange, so it would remain a 
separate company and its operations could not be merged with those of Ryanair.
He said the Government believed a merger between the two airlines would not be in the country's best interests.
 He added that the Government believed a merger between the two airlines would not be in the country's best 
interests. Labour leader Pat Rabbitte had asked why the Government sold off a 7pc holding in Aer Lingus, which he 
claimed had facilitated a takeover. Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party accused the Government of 'allowing the 
cuckoo to get into the Aer Lingus nest', and claimed that Ryanair would use its shareholding to bargain with the 
Government on aviation policy.

Body
Finance minister Brian Cowen has conceded that Ryanair's attempted takeover of Aer Lingus is likely to be a matter 
for the European Commission rather Irish regulatory authorities.
"There is a question as to whether jurisdiction for the purposes of merger clearance rests with the European 
Commission or member states, including Ireland," he told the Dail. 
"It is expected that jurisdiction will lie with the European Commission.
 "The departments of Transport and Finance are working closely with advisors to prepare and make submission to 
the European Commission and will also be consulting with the Attorney General." He faced noisy criticism in the 
House however, over the government's reduction of its stake in Aer Lingus from 35 pc to 28.2 pc. Although 
Brussels is thought likely to look favourably on a Ryanair buyout of the former state airline, Mr Cowen said the no-
frills carrier was "a long way away from the majority shareholding that they seek".

Body
The Dublin market continued to out-perform its European peers today, soaring more than 70 points for the second 
consecutive day.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 79.22 points higher at a new record high of 8427.75.
Investor sentiment was buoyed by traders in Asia who, earlier in the day, had shrugged off fears raised when North 
Korea said it had carried out a nuclear test.
 However, further hints of more interest rate hikes in from European Central Bank president, Jean Claude Trichet, 
could dampen that sentiment in the coming days. President Trichet reiterated that the ECB will need to raise 
interest rates further if the euro zone economy continues to recover in line with its expectations. If the ECB 
governing council's assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, it will 'remain warranted to further withdraw 
monetary accommodation,' Trichet said in a speech to the European Parliament economic and monetary affairs 
committee. The ECB's staff forecasts, published on Aug 31, point to euro zone growth of 2.5pc this year and 2.1pc 
next year. The comments closely match Trichet's introductory statement to the Oct 5 news conference. The ECB 
has hiked rates on five occasions since December last year, taking the benchmark rate to 3.25pc from 2.00pc. The 
latest hike came last week and at least one more is predicted before the year ends. 'Trichet has ticked all the 
hawkish boxes in his latest comments to the EU,' said John Ratcliffe at Thomson IFR Markets. 'He has spoken of 
'careful monitoring' of monetary policy, and the need to monitor price developments 'very closely'. These are all 
more or less the contents of the press conference from last week, and clearly point to a Dec hike and a continued 
hawkish tone,' Ratcliffe added. Back in Dublin, CRH was the day's star performer, climbing 30c to 27.40, after it 
announced the acquisition of a cement plant in China. The good feeling spread throughout the rest of the 
construction sector, with Grafton closing 13c higher on 11.33, McInerney up 1c to 13.15 and Kingspan up 9c to 
16.72. Financial shares were mixed, with AIB slipping 13c to 20.96, Anglo Irish Bank up 5c to 13.60 and Bank of 
Ireland 21c higher on 15.46. Irish Life and Permanent fell 5c to 19.60. Shares in Aer Lingus fell back in late 
ISEQ soars 79 points to record high
afternoon trading, down 7c to 2.89, having been as high as 3.00 earlier in the day as the market awaits further 
developments in Ryanair's hostile bid for the airline. Shares in Ryanair also slipped into the red, down 4c to 8.61. 
Shares in drinks and snacks group C and C were up 1c to 11.56 as it prepares to issue its interim results on 
Thursday. Icon was a notable mover, climbing 83c to 57.24, while Irish Estates was in favour, tacking on 14c to 
4.45. The day's biggest gainer was Viridian Group, which soared almost 28pc, or 425c to 19.45 after it agreed to a 
Â£1.62bn cash bid from Bahraini private equity firm Arcapita last week. The Bahrain group confirmed today that it will 
retain the management of the group. Elsewhere, bookmaker Paddy Power was up 14c to 14.60, UTV climbed 31c 
to 540, while Trinity Biotech climbed 6c to 1.80.

Aer Lingus will use the services of two former top EU competition officials in its fight against Ryanair's hostile bid.
Mario Monti and Karel van Miert both now act as advisers to Goldman Sachs, which is financial adviser to Aer 
Lingus, the Irish Times reported.
The airline has asked Goldman Sachs to prepare a defence to the hostile takeover by Ryanair and this includes 
preparing a regulatory and competition case against the takeover offer.
 The offer made by Michael O'Leary last week is set to become one of the biggest competition cases heard in the 
European airline sector for many years. Strong attempts are being made to block the E2.80-a-share Ryanair bid, 
announced last Thursday. An employee shareholding group, the Employee Share Ownership Trust (Esot), and a 
group of pilots are understood to be considering purchasing additional shares in an attempt to frustrate the Ryanair 
bid. Opponents of the bid believe if up to 10 per cent of the airline's equity - over the State and Esot stakes - can be 
kept away from Mr O'Leary, his chances of getting more than 50 per cent will be frustrated.

Fine Gael MEP Gay Mitchell has written to the EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes to investigate the matter of 
Ryanair's purchase of almost 20pc of shares in Aer Lingus and reports that the company may bid for a controlling 
stake in Aer Lingus. 
He has also placed a question on the matter to the Commission.
Speaking today Deputy Mitchell, who is member of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs 
Committee, said, "I have asked the Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes to investigate this matter to ensure 
that competition rules are fully observed.
 "Whereas Ireland has benefited from the competition introduced by Ryanair, it seems to me that a Ryanair 
takeover of Aer Lingus, just like an Aer Lingus takeover of Ryanair, could be the antithesis of competition and would 
be a disaster for Ireland as competition in the aviation sector is essential for our island economy," he said.

Ryanair raid
Ryanair Holdings had by late last week raised its shareholding in Aer Lingus to 19.2% after the budget airline?s 
declaration of its intention to take over the Irish flag carrier. The Irish government says that it will not sell its minority 
shareholding in Aer Lingus and the carrier?s board has advised other stakeholders not to sell.
Boeing buoyant
Boeing has notched up net orders for 723 airliners so far this year, putting it on track to achieve near parity with 
2005?s record-breaking net order tally of 1,002 and to bring it within range of the previous record year of 1988 
when Boeing and McDonnell Douglas between them amassed 877. The 737 orderbook once again dominates, with 
539 taken so far this year, while the 787 has attracted 111, the 777 24, the 767 eight and the 747 41. Boeing has 
left itself with 100 airliners to deliver between now and the end of the year to achieve its projected 2006 delivery 
target of 395.

Body
Anglo Irish Bank and AIB put last week's poor performance firmly behind them today as the financials led the Dublin 
market sharply higher.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 73.29 points higher on 8348.53.
Investor sentiment was given a boost by figures from the Irish Stock Exchange which revealed a 17pc increase in 
turnover for the first nine months of the year, compared with the same period last year.
 The value of shares traded by the ISE was E94.3 billion, bringing the average daily turnover so far this year to 
E500m. Companies raised E1.56 billion in the third quarter of this year, including E1.2 billion from Aer Lingus before 
its official entry to the exchange earlier this month. The ISEQ index, which recently hit a record high, is up 12pc in 
the nine months, with a 9pc rise in the third quarter alone. Four new companies joined the IEX market in the period 
- Amarin, Petroceltic, Ardent and Petroneft. Anglo Irish Bank and AIB were the only banking stocks in Western 
Europe to lose ground last week amid worries of a slowdown in the Irish property market. Both jumped back in style 
today however, with Anglo Irish Bank climbing 30c to 13.55 and AIB up 47c to 21.08. Elsewhere in the sector, Bank 
of Ireland managed marginal gains tacking on 1c to 15.21, while Irish Life and Permanent bucked the trend, slipping 
4c to 19.65. Shares in Aer Lingus were down slightly, 3c to 2.95, as investors await further developments in 
Ryanair's hostile bid in the flag carrier. Shares in Ryanair were down 16c to 8.64. Drinks and snacks group C and C 
made modest gains, climbing 15c to 11.54, as it prepares to issue its interim results on Thursday. Stockbrokers at 
Goodbody are forecasting that earnings per share will increase by 64.5pc to 26.7 cents, driven by continuing 
strength in its cider brand Magners. In the construction sector, Grafton picked up where it left off on Friday, climbing 
18c to 11.20. Shares in the firm gained an impressive 6pc last week, with an upbeat trading statement from UK

Body
IMPACT will today lodge a pay claim for Ryanair pilots with the Labour Relations Commission, the trade union said 
today. 
The union is seeking a closer alignment with higher-paid Aer Lingus pilots.
IMPACT said the company is likely to reject an LRC intervention and the claim will then be referred, to the Labour 
Court, which is currently considering an IMPACT claim against Ryanair under Ireland's Industrial Relations 
(Amendment) Act, 2004.
 IMPACT lodged the pay claim with Ryanair management last month, which was rejected. The union now believes 
that Ryanair's bid to take over Aer Lingus substantially strengthens the union's claim for a closer alignment of pilots' 
remuneration and working conditions in the two airlines. In October 2005, the Irish High Court rejected Ryanair's 
claim that the Labour Court did not have jurisdiction under the 2004 Act, which allows the Labour Court to set pay 
and conditions in companies that don't engage in collective bargaining. The company has appealed to the Supreme 
Court, which is expected to make a ruling shortly. Ryanair recently lost a separate High Court case against IMPACT 
members, who it had accused of "bullying" other staff. The court ruled that the only evidence of bullying was by 
Ryanair itself and awarded penal costs of E1 million against the company. Dismissing Ryanair's application, the 
judge said evidence given by a senior Ryanair manager was "baseless and false." Ryanair could incur even higher 
costs if it loses its current Supreme Court appeal, IMPACT said.

Body
Airlines may have lost the battle over the implementation of European laws requiring them to compensate 
passengers for cancellation, long delays and being denied boarding.
But the experience of the laws makes them not just irritated but confident that logic will prevail and the European 
Commission will ease back on what they believe are unnecessary and unfair rules.
Certainly, irritation among airlines has not abated since challenges by the International Air Transport Association 
and the European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA) against the regulations were rejected by the European 
Court of Justice in January.
According to John Hanlon, secretary-general of ELFAA, the regulations have taken air travel back to a time when 
the experience of aviation was very different. "When you took an international air journey, you were expected to be 
watered and fed from the start of your journey to the end. Then, market liberalisation provided growth in the low-
cost sector, which enabled as many people to travel as possible by removing extra costs like catering," Mr Hanlon 
says.
"People are not promised catering and they understand that. But now if you are delayed, you are guaranteed to be 
fed and accommodated under these regulations."
Levels of compensation are dependent on length of delays and the time elapsed before alternative arrangements 
are found. Regulations require airlines to pay in all instances cancellation fees unless passengers have been given 
two weeks' notice.
Airlines complain that there is no comparable regulation constraining operators in other forms of travel, that costs 
are disproportionate to the type of carrier and length of journey, and are not necessarily beneficial to passengers.
Power to the passengers EU LEGISLATION: Roger Blitz looks at the compensation regulations thathelp 
customers but leave airlines battling for breath
Ryanair claims that the legislation is not just unnecessary but also contrary to international law, as the Montreal 
Convention already enables passengers to seek compensation in cases where an airline is at fault for a delay.
In reality, airlines are not experiencing a significant increase in costs. Nor do the regulations require a radically 
different level of customer care from the one that airlines already provide. Also, airlines are not predicting that the 
new rules will have any impact on airline punctuality.
On-time performance of scheduled airlines at leading UK airports is 74 per cent, with average delays of 14 minutes. 
For charter flights, it is 65 per cent, with average delays of 28 minutes. The change in these figures quarter by 
quarter is fractional.
Airlines have no interest in cancelling flights for frivolous reasons, Mr Hanlon adds. "Cancellation is resorted to in 
extremis. The average age of our fleets is very low."
What has changed is the burden of customers' claims. It has become greater. The regulations gave rise to what Mr 
Hanlon calls "fanciful claims" from passengers after publicity was given to the new laws.
Passengers are not necessarily the winners here, the airlines point out. Mandatory penalties are changing the way 
airlines think about their obligations and making them look at ways of minimising the risk of incurring any costs 
linked to the regulations - at the expense of passengers. The effect of the regulation is to encourage more carriers 
not to "interline" with other carriers, that is, to provide connecting flights.
More carriers, says Mr Hanlon, are reviewing whether they wish to be involved in linking up itineraries with other 
carriers. "If you are coming from Shanghai via London and on to Belfast, and you are delayed on the last part of 
your journey, you have an entitlement against the London to Belfast operator - if necessary - to fly you back to 
Shanghai on the first available flight," says Mr Hanlon.
"In that instance it would be unwise for carriers to be exposed to that risk. The rules will make them want to operate 
on a point-to-point basis."
Delays are frequently out of the control of airlines. Italian air traffic control, for example, closed Rome air space for 
the day of the funeral of Pope John Paul II.
"Air traffic control does induce a lot of delay. It is more within the gift of the European Commission to reform (air 
traffic control) than individual airlines," says Mr Hanlon.
Like most other airlines, Easyjet has always been in favour of the principle of the aims of the regulations, but 
described it as a bad law that fails in its goal.
"Airlines should look after their customers - there is a duty of care. However, airlines are being penalised for 
situations completely out of their control," Easyjet says.
Compensation penalities of Euros 250 for flights that may cost Pounds 42 are disproportionate, Easyjet says. "We 
have to pick up hotel costs because air traffic control goes on strike for three days," says Easyjet. "Surely, that is 
what passenger travel insurance is there for."
The effect is that Easyjet has abandoned its four-hour delay policy by which money was paid back to the customer 
and the customer would then have the option of flying for nothing.
The European Commission is reviewing the regulations and has appointed consultants to talk to airlines about the 
impact of the legislation. "We are hoping to explain the difficulties. They have prepared an in-depth survey to 
establish what the thoughts of the people governed by them are," Mr Hanlon says. Expect those replies to be 
lengthy and colourful.

International hedge funds have been snapping up shares in Aer Lingus following the shock announcement of a 
hostile takeover bid by Ryanair last week.
Aggressive Wall Street hedge fund Eton Park - the largest hedge fund when founded three years ago by ex-
Goldman Sachs executive Eric Mindich - in effect doubled its stake to 2.8pc in Aer Lingus by buying options to 
acquire stock in the carrier at prices above E2.84.
Dealers said the shares were being supported by hopes that either Ryanair's Michael O' Leary will lift his offer or a 
white knight might fly to the rescue of an embarrassed Irish government which still holds 28pc.
 Though Ryanair has built up a near-20pc stake, analysts believe that the government, the Competition Authority 
and Aer Lingus workers will act to scupper the takeover.

Regulatory notes to the Irish Stock Exchange today revealed the extent of buying and selling of Aer Lingus stocks 
by AIB and Goldman Sachs on Friday.
Statutory disclosures to the Irish Takeover Panel today showed that, last Friday, AIB sold just over 4.4 million 
shares in Aer Lingus at prices ranging from E2.90 per share to E2.98 each.
The bank did not say how much the shares were bought for but, prior to Ryanair's shock announcement last week 
of a hostile bid for the flag-carrier, Aer Lingus shares shot up from E2.51 to E2.98.
 The IPO price for Aer Lingus shares was E2.20 each less than two weeks ago. AIB still controls 9.132 million 
shares in the airline or 1.68pc. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs told the Takeover Panel that it has sold 400,000 Aer 
Lingus shares at E2.9591 each on Friday. Goldman Sachs, in a separate disclosure, said that it had bought 1.05 
million shares in the price range between E2.73 a share and E2.808 a shares and sold 1.666 million shares in the 
price range of E2.456 and E2.884 a share. It said it still controls 0.21pc of Aer Lingus shares.

Some of Ryanair's major investors are concerned over the no-frills airline's Aer Lingus bid attempt.
Ryanair said over the weekend it planned to talk to investors in the US and to explain the strategy of the move to

This is after its largest US investor, Gilder, Gagnon, Howe and Co raised concerns about the need for the bid and 
its timing during a investors' conference call last week. At the weekend Howar Millar, the airline's chief financial 
officer, said discussions with shareholders would take place.
 On Friday ABN Amro downgraded Ryanair to "hold" from "buy" following the Aer Lingus bid. ABN Amro said the 
bid "took us by surprise". It warned that the bid would have major problems in succeeding "because of competition 
policy and Government opposition." Meanwhile analysts at Citigroup added in a note to investors that Ryanair's 
operations would be further complicated by the fact that Aer Lingus uses Airbus aircraft, whereas Ryanair has a 
fleet of Boeing 737s. One of the keys to low-cost flying is using one aircraft type as this saves on maintenance and 
spare parts.

ESOT, the Aer Lingus employees' shareholder group, is set to block Ryanair's E1.4 billion takeover bid for the 
airline.
If the ESOT and other staff shareholders manage to increase their stake by a few percentage points and they form 
a loose alliance with one other substantial shareholder, the chances of Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary

One source who is advising the opponents of the Ryanair bid said: "Every share that is taken off the table puts 
another dent in the Ryanair attempt to get control."
 Ryanair currently has a 19.2pc stake; the ESOT and other staff shareholders have 14.9pc; while the Government 
has 28pc; the remaining shares are held by institutions and wealthy individuals. Aer Lingus has asked a sub-
committee of its board to frame a strategy to deal with the Ryanair offer. The former chief executive of Anglo Irish 
Bank, Sean Fitzpatrick, and solicitor Ivor Fitzpatrick are members of this committee.

The Irish government last night went on the offensive against Ryanair, the country's largest airline, and said it was 
"hard to comprehend" the rationale for the low-cost carrier's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 997m) takeover bid for Aer 
Lingus.
Battling to fend off criticism of the handling of last week's initial public offering of Aer Lingus, Martin Cullen, Irish 
transport minister, said the government was determined to maintain at least 25.1 per cent to protect the state's 
strategic interests. It currently has 28.3 per cent.
He said this stake ensured another company could not acquire the 75 per cent required to force a de-listing. It also 
meant the company's Memorandum and Articles of Association could not be changed without state consent.
"Against the backdrop where the company cannot be de-listed, the announcement by Ryanair is hard to 
comprehend. Without de-listing, and operational integration with Ryanair, it is hard to see how the synergies, which 
motivate mergers and takeovers, could be realised."
He said information put out by Ryanair "does not resolve this fundamental question. Ryanair investors must be 
unsure what this is all about".
One possibility was that this was "a defensive move by Ryanair to tackle the threat of competition from a well-
resourced Aer Lingus with a clear business plan", said Mr Cullen.
Last night, Ryanair's share price closed 13 cents higher at Euros 8.80 while Aer Lingus closed up 8 cents at Euros 
2.98, well above the Euros 2.80 Ryanair offer price.

EasyJet raises full-year guidance as it shrugs off terror alert

EasyJet has lifted its profit guidance for the year after strong sales in September showed the UK low-cost carrier 
was suffering few after-effects from August's UKterror alerts.
The budget airline yesterday said it expected pre-tax profit for the year to September 30 to be slightly ahead of 
previous estimates, which had forecast growth of 40 to 50 per cent to between Pounds 115m and Pounds 124m, up 
from Pounds 82.6m last year.
The strength of the budget aviation sector was underlined on Thursday when Ryanair, EasyJet's biggest European 
competitor, launched an audacious Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn) takeover offer for Aer Lingus only days after the 
Irish national carrier was successfully floated in Dublin and London.
If successful, a Ryanair deal would be the first take-over of a legacy networkcarrier by one of the new breed of low-
cost airlines.
EasyJet said passenger numbers in the year to September were 11.5 per cent higher than last year, with revenues 
per seat rising by 7.8 per cent. Yearly revenues rose 21 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn.
However, its shares, which have gained 65 per cent in the past year, fell by 2 1/4p to close at 495 3/4p yesterday. 
Some analysts had worried that the low-cost airline business model would suffer because of the stringent security 
measures introduced in the wake of the August terror alerts.
Baggage restrictions have been relaxed slightly but intensive security checks of passengers remain in place. The 
security turmoil at UK airports cost EasyJet about Pounds 4m and forced it to cancel 469 flights over five days.
The main problems were caused at the London airports where EasyJet hasits three biggest basesat Gatwick, Luton 
andStansted.

Both the European and the Irish competition authorities expect Ryanair's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn) takeover bid 
for Aer Lingus to be referredinitially to Brussels forscrutiny rather than toDublin.
Competition lawyers said yesterday that the takeover, as proposed by Ryanair on Thursday, would meet the 
necessary criteria to come within the jurisdiction of the European competition authorities, namely that:
* the combined worldwide turnover of the two groups exceeds Euros 2.5bn;
* the combined turnover exceeds Euros 100m in at least three European Union member states.
Formally, it is up to the bidder in the first instance to notify the relevant authorities at any stage before the deal is 
implemented.
The European competition directorate said yesterday that no such move had yet been made formally byRyanair.
It also refused to comment on any informal soundings taken by the Irish carrier, which is Europe's leading low-cost 
airline.
Brussels has shown itself to be broadly favourable to consolidation in the European airline industry in the belief that 
the sector is far too fragmented.
With an era of globalairline liberalisation somewhere over the horizon, Brussels believes there should be strong 
European airlines able to competesuccessfully on the world stage.
The Air France/KLM and Lufthansa/Swiss deals found little objection in Brussels, and any problems could be solved 
by the remedy ofgiving up some airportslots to rivals to allowthem on to sensitive routes.
In practice, however, there could be significant issues to overcome to gain competition approval for an Aer Lingus 
takeover and much will hinge on the approach the authorities take in defining the appropriate markets.
Brussels to scrutinise deal with the Irish keen for their say COMPETITION ISSUES
Ryanair said on Thursday that there were overlaps on only 17 of the 500 routes operated by the two airlines. 
However, rival carriers were quick to point out thatRyanair actually overlaps on 62 per cent of Aer Lingus's 
European capacity on a basis of city-pairs.
While there are few direct overlaps on routes airport-to- airport, such as Dublin to London Stansted, where Aer 
Lingus is absent - or Dublin to Heathrow, where Ryanair is absent - both airlines operate in the samewider market 
of Dublin to London.
Based on figures for July, Ryanair had 54.2 per cent of the capacity in the Ireland/UK market and Aer Lingus had 
23.8 per cent.
In the Ireland/continental European market Aer Lingus had 43.2 per cent of the capacity and Ryanair 32.1 per cent.
Under European competition rules, even if Brussels has jurisdiction over the Ryanair/Aer Lingus case, it would be 
open to Dublin to ask for a role in the inquiry on the grounds of the deal's potential impact on one state, but such a 
referral would be entirely at the discretion of the Commission.
The clear rejection of the bid by the Irish government, which still owns 28.3 per cent Aer Lingus equity, suggests 
that Dublin will seek such a role.
Martin Cullen, Irish transport minister, said on Thursday: "What Ryanair is now in effect trying to do is recreate a 
monopoly in the aviation sector in this country.
"A monopoly is bad for business, bad for this country, bad for the customer, bad for the travelling public and it's bad 
for tourism interests in this country."
Mr Cullen added that the government had "fostered and encouraged competition, particularly in the aviation sector. 
We certainly do not want to see a new monopoly created in aviation."

Body
A trust set up at Aer Lingus more than a decade ago to reward workers for improvements in work practices looks 
likely to play a key role if Ryanair's bid for the former state airline is to succeed.
With Ryanair owning just under 20 per cent, the 9.6 per cent owned by the Employee Share Ownership Trust could 
prove critical if Michael O'Leary is to gain majority control.
The seven-member trustee board of the ESOT met yesterday but made no comment afterwards.
On Thursday, Grant Farrell Sparks, the trust's advisers, issued a statement refuting Ryanair's claim that employees 
would on average receive more than Euros 60,000 (Pounds 40,415) if they accepted the offer.
It argued that there would be capital gains tax to pay by the trust when it sold its shares and individual income tax 
when the proceeds were subsequently distributed to the 5,000-odd trust beneficiaries.
However, the statement, unlike both the government and the company, did not reject the Ryanair offer outright.
Although it is currently a cash offer, one broker familiar with the way the ESOT worked at Eircom, the former state 
telecommunications company, said if Ryanair was prepared to offer shares instead, this would create less tax 
headaches and might prove more appealing to the trust.
A union official said the ESOT had a fiduciary duty to accept an offer deemed in the best interests of the 
beneficiaries.
A decision on the offer from Ryanair is certain to require a ballot of ordinary members.

European stocks climbed to their best levels for more than five years this week as investors took their cue from 
record highs for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a flurry of merger and acquisition activity and encouraging 
valuations.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index closed yesterday at 1,412.11, up 1.1 per cent over the week and its highest finish 
since July 2001.
Citigroup, the US bank, said it remained bullish on the outlook for equities in the region and expected double-digit 
returns over the coming year.
"With European equities not rerated since 2003, valuations - both absolute and relative to bonds - are still 
attractive," Citigroup said. "Additionally, de-equitisation continues to provide support to share prices through 
mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buy-outs and capital returns."
Much of the M&A fever gripping the markets this week centred on banks. Spain's BBVA rose as high as Euros 
20.26 yesterday on talk that Banco Santander Central Hispano might be considering a takeover of its smaller rival. 
Santander denied the rumours. Early in the week, a report in the French press claimed BBVA was one of four 
European banks being considered as possible takeover targets by Citigroup of the US.
BBVA shares finally settled yesterday at Euros 19.01, down 0.5 per cent on the day but up 4.2 per cent over the 
week. BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, also suggested as potential bid targets by the French report, rose 2.4 
per cent to Euros 86.90 and 1.5 per cent to Euros 126.60 respectively on the week.
Santander denied talk it was considering buying the 11 per cent of Banesto it does not own. Banesto shares 
yesterday rose 3.8 per cent to Euros 16.26, but were slightly lower for the week, partly due to a downgrade by 
Deutsche Bank. Santander gained 2.8 per cent to Euros 12.82.
Scania, the Swedish truckmaker that rejected a Euros 9.6bn hostile bid from MAN, jumped 6.1 per cent to 
SKr463.50 over the week. MAN yesterday said it would offer friendly talks after Volkswagen, Scania's biggest 
M&A fever helps Eurofirst to five-year peak EUROPE
shareholder, acquired a 15 per cent stake in the German truck group. MAN shares closed at Euros 67.82 for a gain 
of 1.6 per cent, while VW rose 1 per cent to Euros 67.82.
ThyssenKrupp added4.9 per cent to Euros 27.86 as the prospect of further consolidation in the steel sector was 
raised by news that India's Tata Steel was considering a bid for Anglo-Dutch group Corus, up25 per cent at Euros 
7.15.
Aer Lingus ended the week at Euros 2.98, up 35 per cent from its initial public offer price of Euros 2.20, after 
Ryanair's surprise Euros 1.48bn bid for the group. Ryanair rose 4.3 per cent to Euros 8.80.
It was a grim week for EADS shareholders as the aerospace group's warning of further delays to its A380 
superjumbo sent analysts rushing to lower their ratings and share price targets.
EADS shares fell 9.9 per cent to Euros 20.43, although some observers said that the bad news was now largely 
priced into the stock.

Even before Thursday's bombshell announcement of Ryanair's takeover bid for Aer Lingus, Bertie Ahern, Ireland's 
prime minister, was under political attack over his personal financial dealings.
Today, among ordinary Irish men and women, the entire government stands accused of financial mismanagement 
after what is already being described as the second botched privatisation on its watch.
After last week's Aer Lingus initial public offering, one senior minister commented only half in jest: "We've got our 
money out and the Paddies are still in control."
That was before Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he was mounting a Euros 2.80-a-share bid, valuing 
the former state carrier at Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn).
With the flamboyant Mr O'Leary in charge, the "Paddies" would still be in control, though that is hardly what the 
minister envisaged.
But the government has been embarrassed in several regards. There is the potentially electoral fall out from this 
affair, with the bulk of Aer Lingus 3,500 employees living in the crucial constituencies of north Dublin.
With an election in 2007, these votes could be vital for Mr Ahern's Fianna Fail party and his chances of retaining 
power.
With Ryanair and Aer Lingus under the same ownership, analysts say it would give Mr O'Leary a huge say in the 
direction of transport policy - and particularly on the development of the Euros 700m second Dublin air terminal, 
where he has lodged a formal planning objection.
"It will have a big impact. But my gut feeling is the government at the moment is not looking at how it might affect 
the airport but rather at how foolish they look on the pricing issue," said one industry observer.
Dublin embarrassed by Ryanair's audacity John Murray Brown analyses the fall-out for Bertie Ahern's 
government after the bid for Aer Lingus
But he conceded that, if Mr O'Leary had effective control of 70 per cent of Dublin Airport's traffic, he would have a 
near stranglehold over developments.
At street level, there was bewilderment at how the government, on the behalf of the taxpayer, was a willing seller of 
Aer Lingus at Euros 2.20 and yet was not a seller at Euros 2.80 - Ryanair's offer price.
Trade unions, who were unanimously opposed to the IPO, accuse the government of creating a new private 
monopoly where they intended to increase competition. They say the price was pitched too low, thus allowing Mr 
O'Leary and his advisers to mastermind their daring raid on Aer Lingus.
Whatever the advice, it did not come cheap - with Euros 30m consumed in fees. But a senior finance ministry 
official, who took part in the meeting to set the IPO price, says the government and Aer Lingus were anxious to 
have what he called a "stable share register".
The advice was, if the price was raised, there would be fewer traditional fund managers and more hedge funds.
The government and its advisers insist there was unanimity on the price.
The government may well have noted the Air Berlin float in May - which was priced too aggressively with the 
advisers forced to lower the price and the IPO delayed.
Dublin must also have been mindful not the repeat the experience of 1999 flotation of Telecom Eireann - 
subsequently renamed Eircom - its other important privatisation.
This was marketed aggressively by a government anxious to nurture a share-owning culture only to see the shares 
plummet as the dotcom bubble burst, inflicting big losses on investors.
Ministers were clearly keen to minimise the potential for repetition with Aer Lingus - one reason the minimum 
subscription was 10,000 shares, too big an outlay for most small investors.
Announcing the intention to float earlier this year, Martin Cullen, transport minister, said it would not be an "all-
singing, all-dancing" affair, a reference to the razzmatazz that surrounded the Eircom flotation.
On that occasion there was open warfare between the minister and the company chief executive over the price - 
with the latter effectively accusing the former of being too greedy.
This week, the government stood accused, effectively, of being too generous and too naive.

Shares in both Ryanair Holdings PLC and Aer Lingus Group PLC rose Friday as investors gambled that Ryanair's 
hostile takeover bid for its Irish rival would produce a higher offer.
Aer Lingus shares closed 2.8 percent higher at â¬2.98 (US$3.76) a 35 percent premium to the airline's â¬2.20 IPO 
price Sept. 27, and 6 percent above Ryanair's â¬2.80-per-share offer Thursday that stunned the Irish government, 
investors and Aer Lingus chiefs.
Ryanair said it had acquired 19.2 percent of Aer Lingus shares as of Thursday night. Ryanair was excluded from 
Friday's dealing because, under terms of takeover law, it cannot buy shares priced over its offer price of â¬2.80.
Analysts agree that Ryanair, which has rapidly expanded across Europe but never mounted such an ambitious 
takeover bid before, certainly could afford to raise its offer, because it has cash reserves exceeding â¬2 billion 
(US$2.6 billion).
While analysts are divided on the merits of acquiring Aer Lingus for Ryanair, shares in Europe's leading no-frills 
carrier also rose 1.5 percent Friday to close at â¬8.80 (US$11.09).
The government, which sold most of its holding in the previously state-owned carrier to give it the freedom to grow, 
insists it will retain a minimum 25.1 percent stake the minimum required to block any attempt by a majority owner to 
have the company de-listed from stock markets. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary says he wouldn't mind having the 
government as a minority holder, because Ryanair's bid requires only 50.1 percent share ownership to take control.
However, regulatory hurdles loom both in Ireland and at the European Commission. Analysts say competition 
authorities probably would order both airlines to surrender lucrative slots at Dublin airport to British no-frills 
competitors, which currently have found it impossible to crack the Republic of Ireland market. Also likely to be 
relinquished would be slots at Ryanair's main London base, Stansted, and Aer Lingus' main London hub, Heathrow.
CEO Dermot Mannion, who broke off a holiday in the United States to return to Dublin, said Friday he was certain 
that the Ryanair bid would fail and Aer Lingus would remain independent. He said most major institutional investors, 
Ryanair 's hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus drives both shares higher
who bought about 40 percent of the IPO shares last week, would want to keep their money in an independent Aer 
Lingus and not cash in for a good, quick profit.
"We're not concerned. ... Those investors we believe are going to stay with us because they like the Aer Lingus 
value proposition," he told Ireland's state broadcasters, RTE.
Mannion rejected Irish media reports that Aer Lingus would welcome a rival "white knight" bid from another airline, 
particularly British Airways PLC, which is run by Aer Lingus' former chief executive, Willie Walsh.

Budget airline easyJet raised its full year profit forecast on Friday on the back of increased passenger numbers and 
higher ticket prices.
EasyJet, Europe's second largest low-cost airline behind Ryanair Holdings PLC, now expects pretax profit for the 
year ended Sept. 30, 2006 to be "slightly ahead" of its previous guidance of growth of 40 to 50 percent. The airline 
made a pretax profit of 82.6 million pounds ($155 million) last year.
EasyJet said its revenue for the year ended Sept. 30 increased 20.7 percent to 1.62 billion pounds ($3.05 billion). 
Passenger numbers over the year rose 12 percent to 32.95 million and revenue per seat rose 7.8 percent.
EasyJet said that it carried 3 million passengers in September, an increase of 9.8 percent on the same month last 
year.
Meanwhile, Air France-KLM and Scandinavian airline group SAS AB both reported passenger increases in 
September.
At Air France-KLM September passenger numbers rose 4.3 percent to 6.42 million. The world's largest airline by 
revenue also announced a cut to its fuel surcharge, in response to a recent decline in oil prices. It will pare 1 euro 
($1.27) from the cost of a domestic flight, 2 euros ($2.54) from medium-haul trips and 7 euros ($8.90) from long-
haul tickets, effective Saturday.
SAS AB said it carried 2.4 percent more passengers in September compared with the same month last year.
The company carried 3.6 million passengers in September, while group traffic including freight operations increased 
by 5.2 percent.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, is seldom stuck for words.
But he will have to do a lot of convincing to justify his latest move to try to take over Aer Lingus only days after the 
rival Irish carrier completed its own successful flotation on the Irish and London stock exchanges.
In the days leading up to Aer Lingus's initial public offering Paddy Power, Ireland's biggest provider of fixed-odds 
sports betting, opened a book on what stunt Mr O'Leary would pull to "deflect attention away from the national 
carrier's day of glory".
You could take a punt on Ryanair offering a big free flight promotion, introducing an inflight service, launching 
transatlantic routes or acquiring the naming rights to Dublin airport as "Ryanair Airport". But not even Paddy Power 
came up with the outlandish notion of Ryanair making a takeover bid for Aer Lingus.
"He never fails to surprise that man - it's incredible," the bookmaker said last night.
Investors were as nonplussed as analysts and bookmakers as the Ryanair share price fluctuated during the day 
making early gains, then falling away. It closed 9 cents lower at Euros 8.63.
"No one dreamed he would buy a network airline," said one leading aviation analyst. "Aer Lingus is suddenly 
available but this is the action of a pirate. Ryanair is one of the best low-cost carriers in the world with afantastic 10 
years of future growth ahead. Where, though, is the strategic logic of the deal?"
Mr O'Leary has built Ryanair ruthlessly since the mid-1990s into Europe's leading low-cost carrier. It is already on 
track to carry 42.5m passengers in the current financial year to the end of March and is planning for 84m by 2012.
UK AND IRELAND: 'Trust us' over shock bid, says Ryanair But Michael O'Leary will have to do a lot of 
convincing after themove for Aer Lingus, writes Kevin Done
It is aiming to more than double its fleet of 189-seat Boeing 737-800s from the 134 due by next March to 281 
aircraft by March 2012.
It has been the most profitable airline in Europe for several years and one of the most profitable in the world, with 
net margins consistently above 20 per cent.
British Airways, the airline currently with the highest absolute operating profit in the world, still dreams of margins of 
10 per cent and that is only at an operating, not a net, level.
Mr O'Leary has achieved this success with a zealot's commitment to the purist principles of the low-cost airline 
model. He has the lowest costs in Europe. The seats on his aircraft no longer recline, there are no blinds on the 
windows and there will soon be mobile phone services.
You can buy inflight scratch cards, he charges for baggage and there will be seat-back advertising - anything to 
make money.
He offers cheap flights and more punctual flights than his rivals.
He thinks his passengers can expect no more. And in most cases, they get no more. If you want anything else or 
you cannot stand the noise on board, take another airline. And if you are an employee, you can forget union 
representation.
He is unapologetic. And the formula has been an outstanding success. Until now.
If he takes over Aer Lingus, the magic circle could be broken.
Aer Lingus itself has achieved a highly successful turnround since 2001 and a near brush with bankruptcy.
It has been transformed from a state-owned legacy airline and network carrier into a lower-cost, low-fare short-haul 
operator with long-haul operations largely to the US. It has restructured and shed thousands of jobs but it remains 
highly unionised and a bastion of the union movement in Ireland. So why does Ryanair want it?
Howard Millar, deputy chief executive and chief financial officer, said simply: "We think it is a good investment. We 
don't do things without having thought about it.
"Aer Lingus after Ryanair is one of the most profitable carriers in Europe. We know them very well. We think with 
our know-how (and) our purchasing power, we can improve the business and make it even better."
Mr Millar argued that Ryanair would be able to bring its "enormous leverage with Boeing" to bear to obtain lower 
aircraft acquisition costs for Aer Lingus. It would also be able to negotiate better airport deals.
Ryanair has spent much of its life rudely abusing the Irish government - and most other governments and the 
European Commission. But as political controversy raged yesterday in Ireland over the move, Ryanair said it was 
perfectly prepared to keep the Irish government as a minority shareholder at Aer Lingus, where it still holds a 28 per 
cent stake after the IPO.
"We will control the board," said Mr Millar. "We will have the majority. 'All in favour? Aye.' That's how boards work."
Equally, Ryanair was cheerily confident that it could overcome competition objections. The size of the proposed 
deal appears to ensure it will be scrutinised by the European as well as the Irish competition authorities. Brussels 
has shownitself broadly favourable to consolidation in the European airline industry, believingthe sectortoo 
fragmented.
Ultimately, even Mr O'Leary was a little at a loss yesterday to explain any bigger rationale than a financial killing. He 
ended his address to analysts with the words: "Trust us that we are doing something sensible."

Cunning dawn raid hard to repeat
Even by his own standards of diplomacy, Michael O'Leary has raised the bar when it comes to using aggressive 
tactics in hostile takeovers.
The Ryanair chief executive quietly mopped up 16 per cent of the shares in rival airline Aer Lingus before launching 
a full-blown bid yesterday.
The purchases were made just days after Aer Lingus's initial public offering (IPO). It is hard to imagine a more 
hostile start to a takeover.
Bidders normally struggle to pull off a "dawn raid" such as this without exposing their identity or massively pushing 
up the price of the target stock. Ryanair has avoided either pitfall. It paid on average Euros 2.42 per share, only a 
10 per cent premium to Aer Lingus's already discounted float price. Meanwhile, traders were wrongly pointing 
fingers at BA.
The move could lower the total cost of Ryanair's bid, pitched at Euros 2.80 a share for the outstanding stock.
Having bought more shares yesterday, Ryanair is now closer to gaining 50 per cent of the stock, giving it effective 
control of Aer Lingus, assuming regulatory clearance.
One downside to such tactics is that they make it harder to do an agreed deal later on. But that was an unrealistic 
ambition here, given the apparent reluctance of the Irish government, Aer Lingus's dominant shareholder, to 
countenance a sale.
Many UK companies may be fretting that they are vulnerable to similar assaults. Ryanair has made it look so easy. 
Indeed, buying stock in a target has been an increasingly popular tool for bidders, having recently sealed the fate of 
BAA, the airports group.
Ryanair shows what it really means to go hostile CHRIS HUGHES LOMBARD
However, Aer Lingus looks like a special case. Ryanair was able to grab some of the shares because many 
investors in the Aer Lingus float were hedge funds looking to make a fast buck by selling out quickly. The Irish 
government should be asking its advisers, Allied Irish Banks and UBS, if they could have done more to sell the IPO 
to long-term investors who might not have sold out so fast.
Shares in most companies that have been listed for some time are not so liquid that they are vulnerable to dawn 
raids on this scale. Still, Ryanair has shown companies looking to float why they might prefer their shares to go to 
committed investors.

It was not just his choice of phrase that that was uncharacteristically restrained yesterday.
Michael O'Leary's whole demeanour appeared more sober than usual as Ryanair came out of a proverbial clear 
blue sky to announce an all-cash Euros 2.80-a-share takeover bid for Aer Lingus.
The jeans and check shirt had been discarded in favour of the well-cut dark suit and black Gucci loafers.
Apart from one reference to Jesus, the famous expletives were absent.
Stock exchange rules restricts what he can say about a deal that values the Irish national carrier at Euros 1.48bn 
(Pounds 1bn).
Indeed, there is still confusion as to what the rationale for Ryanair's bid is.
Some questioned whether it is a device to put Aer Lingus in play to flush out another bidder, enabling Ryanair to 
make a quick profit on its investment, or if Ryanair is genuinely committed to buying its smaller Irish rival.
However, all agree this is the biggest corporate event in Ryanair's history since it floated in May 1997.
In those nine years, Mr O'Leary has come to personify Ryanair's brash, no-holds-barred, business ethos.
He has emerged as a personality in an industry that has never been short of big egos.
Although Ryanair, by his admission yesterday, is one of Europe's biggest airlines, he still likes to act as if he is a 
rebel fighting the airline establishment.
In Ireland, he is often involved in crafting the company's adverts, revelling in lampooning ministers.
UK AND IRELAND : Plain talking from O'Leary
Some of his famous publicity stunts have backfired, such as when the airline's millionth customer sued the 
company after it reneged on a promise to give her free flights for life. The airline was also in hot water in a dispute 
over charges for wheelchair passengers.
He has been known to play football with his pilots and help out the baggage handlers but his friendliness belies a 
brilliant and often ruthless business brain.
No one can question his achievement after transforming Ryanair from an airline carrying 4m passengers in 1998 to 
one carrying more than 40m this year. What is more, the low-cost model is now favoured for almost all short-haul 
services.
The proposed takeover,Mr O'Leary argued, is inline with other European consolidation and therefore should not 
trigger a regulatory challenge.
Where the proposed deal is unusual is that it is a low-fares operator that is acquiring the flag carrier, not the other 
way round.
If successful, this would be Ryanair's first big takeover.
Previously, Mr O'Leary has talked as if he can push rivals to one side just through competition.
Aged 45, there are signs that he is slowing down.
He was married three years ago and now has a baby boy. However, even with his latest pastime - racehorse 
breeding - he exhibits a winner's streak.
At the Cheltenham national hunt festival last year, a horse trained at his Mullingar stud won the prestigious Gold 
Cup. The horse's name was War of Attrition.
Many analysts wonder whether Mr O'Leary is preparing for his own corporate war of attrition to control the former 
state carrier.

To do a deal because it offers better returns than keeping the money on deposit seems an odd motivation, yet this 
is one of the stated factors behind Ryanair's surprise Euros 1.5bn offer for Aer Lingus. The promptly rejected 
approach has other unusual facets.
Ryanair built a 19 per cent stake only days after Aer Lingus' initial public offering. Yet it is debatable whether the 
deal will make it past European competition authorities. ABN Amro calculates that the two airlines have 78 per cent 
of the UK/Ireland market between them, and Ryanair's suggestion that the companies could be run separately 
seems unlikely to satisfy regulators. Against that, European regulators favour consolidation to create powerful 
European carriers and Ryanair has legal advice that the issue will be considered on an airport-to-airport basis, 
following European precedent. Crucially, this would split the Dublin-London route into five markets.
The Irish government has already said it will not sell the 28 per cent stake it currently holds, though this does not 
prevent Ryanair gaining control. The government also opposes the disposal of any of Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots 
and has written in safeguards against this. Chief executive Michael O'Leary's colourfully worded attacks on plans 
for a second terminal at Dublin airport have hardly fostered a constructive relationship - as yesterday's anti-
monopoly rhetoric from the transport minister appeared to confirm.
In the event that these issues are resolved, the deal is unlikely to get done at this price. But, whatever the price, any 
deal would alter Ryanair's profile, since it would no longer offer a pure play on the low-cost, short-haul market. Such 
a deviation may suggest that its rapid organic growth within Europe is starting to run out of steam. Still, given its 
cost-cutting record, it could probably be counted on to improve Aer Lingus' profitability. That at least sounds like a 
better reason to bid than improving returns on its cash pile.

Flurry of takeover rumours help FTSE 100 close above 6,000-mark LONDON
Flurry of takeover rumours help FTSE 100 close above 6,000-mark LONDON

The London market was awash with takeover activity and speculation yesterday after a flurry of bid stories were 
flushed out.
Steel company Corus rose 16.2 per cent to 473 3/4p on news that Tata Steel is considering a bid. Irish power 
company Viridian gained 12.4 per cent to Pounds 12.21 after it disclosed a bid approach and stock market 
newcomer Aer Lingus rallied 15 per cent higher to Euros 2.90 after an audacious bid by Ryanair.
Perhaps the most intriguing tale was that United Business Media, the business-to-business publisher and owner of 
PR Newswire, had drawn interest from a private equity group.
Traders noted the rumours came a day after Morgan Stanley had upgraded its rating on UBM to "overweight" and 
set a 745p target price, citing recent deal activity in the sector.
Indeed, last month Apax Partners paid Pounds 199m for Incisive Media, 1.4 per cent weaker at 195 1/2p, the 
publisher of Insurance Age and Legal week, and said it was planning further acquisition of business publishers.
Although UBM is amuch bigger company, analysts pointed out that the company has a strong balance sheet and 
there would be the potential for a private equity buyer to sell on some of its businesses to finance an offer.
UBM shares closed4.9 per cent higher at 715 1/2p, while in the credit default market, the cost of insuring UBM debt 
rose.
Elsewhere, Intertek Group, the FTSE 250 testing and inspection group, rose3 per cent to 808 1/2p in heavy volume 
excited by rumours that its Swiss rival, SGS Surveillance, is about to hit the acquisition trail.
In the summer, Dan Kerpelman, chief executive of SGS, told a Swiss newspaper that he was ready to do a big deal 
and highlighted Intertek as a possible target. He noted the two companies had a lot of overlapping activities, 
especially in the consumer goods and oil and gas markets.
Flurry of takeover rumours help FTSE 100 close above 6,000-mark LONDON
Meanwhile, BT Group eased 0.4 per cent to 268 1/2p in spite of talk that Deutsche Telekom is runningthe numbers 
on a possible bid. Analysts said DT would love to get its hand onBT Global Services but the German company's 
lowly share price would probably preclude a move for BT in the near-term.
Accident Exchange, the motor accident management group, improved 3.4 per cent to 357p on talk that it has 
received an approach.Traders cited Helphire,1.9 per cent better at 395p, or one of the large dealerships as possible 
predators.
These takeover stories added to Wall Street's strong overnight performance and a good showing from the 
heavyweight oil sector to help help the FTSE 100 rise 38 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 6,004.5 - the first time it had 
closed above 6,000 since global markets wobbled in May. The FTSE 250 advanced122.4 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 
10,128.6.
BG Group gained 3.4 per cent to 646 1/2p, helped by a rally in the oil price and a push from Cazenove. The broker 
said the market had ignored big gas finds in the North Sea and Brazil recently announced by BG.
Cazenove was also behind the rise in British Energy, up 2.9 per cent to 572p. Reiterating its outperform rating, the 
broker said the recent fall in wholesale spot gas prices would have little effect on BE because the company 
contracts its sales forward and long-term power prices have remained steady.
Traders reckoned BE shares had also been supported by rumours that Germany's Eon has approached the British 
government with an offer to buy its 65 per cent stake in the nuclear power company.
On the downside, Sage,the accountancy software group, eased 1.1 per centto 244 1/2 amid talk it has been guiding 
earnings forecasts lower.
Lower down the market, car insurance company Admiral Group rose0.4 per cent to 852p after Bear Stearns 
reiterated its "outperform" rating and 928p target price in the wake of a meeting with chief executive Henry 
Englehardt.
"In his view, the market is probably underestimating the impact that revised reinsurance terms could have on the 
company. These new terms could take effect from 2007," the broker said.
Restaurant Group rallied 1.2 per cent to 242p after fund management group Fidelity completed a large sell order. 
Traders reckon an overseas stake builder has being mopping up the Fidelity stock.
Vague takeover talk helped Enodis, the catering equipment manufacturer, improve 1.9 per cent to 177 1/2p.

European stocks climbed to their best levels for more than five years yesterday as merger and acquisition activity 
continued to provide support to the markets.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 7.73 points, or0.6 per cent, to 1,410.11, its highest close since July 2001. 
Benchmark stock indicesin Switzerland and Spain showed record highs.
Ryanair, the low-cost airline, surprised the market when it launched an audacious Euros 1.48bn bid for Aer Lingus.
Ryanair said it had bought a 19.2 per cent stake in the Irish flag carrier in the market and intended to make an all-
cash offer of Euros 2.80 a share for the rest. Aer Lingus rejected the offer.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at ABN Amro, said he saw only limited chances of the bid succeeding. "We think 
Ryanair is lookingfor speculative investment gains, publicity and political gain," he said. "It will likely gain all of 
these. We don't think it will gain a medium-sized airline with a shamrock on the tail."
Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon said airline acquisitions were notoriously difficult to implement successfully. 
"Even though Ryanair intends to keep both businesses separate, differences in working practices or salary 
structures, for example, may become potential issues," he said.
"The shares recently hit our Euros 8.50 target price and given the uncertainty surrounding the offer for Aer Lingus, 
we are cutting our recommendation from "buy" to "hold".
Ryanair shares fell as low as Euros 8.33 before closing just 0.8 per cent weaker at Euros 8.63. Aer Lingus - which 
began trading only on Monday after an initial public offering at Euros 2.20 a share - climbed 15.5 per cent to Euros 
2.90.
There was also talk of more consolidation in the steel sector after India's Tata Steel said it might bid for Corus. The 
Anglo-Dutch steelmaker's Amsterdam-listed shares jumped 15.8 per cent to Euros 7.03.ThyssenKrupp, Germany's 
biggest steelmaker, climbed 3.6 per cent to Euros 27.18 while smaller rival Salzgitter gained 3.2 per cent to Euros 
77.82.
Equities climb to five-year highs EUROPE
The move follows the Euros 31bn acquisition by Mittal Steel of Arcelor earlier this year. Arcelor Mittal shares rose 3 
per cent to Euros 27.70.
But MAN, the German truckmaker, fell another 3.6 per cent to Euros 66 as investors continued to digest the 
implications of Volkswagen's acquisition on Wednesday of a 15 per cent stake. Last month, MAN launched a Euros 
9.6bn bid for Swedish rival Scania, whose main shareholder is Volkswagen.
Jose Assumendi, analyst at WestLB, said Volkswagen's move was intended to guard and strengthen the potential 
of its own truck businesses and its investment in Scania. VW shares rose 1.2 per cent to Euros 69.65 while Scania 
B added 0.8 per cent to SKr465.50.

Body
Ryanair yesterday launched a Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn) takeover offer for Aer Lingus, only days after the Irish 
national carrier was floated in Dublin and London, and, by last night, the low-cost airline had captured a stake of 
19.2 per cent.
If successful, the audacious attack by Europe's leading budget airline on its smaller local rival would transform the 
aviation map in Europe with the first takeover of a legacy network carrier by one of the new breed of low-cost 
airlines.
The bid whipped up a political storm in Ireland where the Irish government, which still has a28 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus and faces a general election early next year, rejected the Ryanair offer. The board of Aer Lingus 
unanimously rejected the bid.
However, Howard Millar, Ryanair deputy chief executive and chief financial officer, said the group would "be happy 
with50.1 per cent".
Martin Cullen, Irish transport minister, said: "What Ryanair is now in effect trying to do is recreate a monopoly in the 
aviation sector in this country. A monopoly is bad for business, bad for this country, bad for the travelling public and 
it's bad for tourism interests in this country."
Aer Lingus has again become a potentially damaging political issue, just at the point when the government believed 
it had resolved the uncertainty through last week's listing after years of efforts to privatise the carrier.
The bid also surprised rival airlines, as it breaks the mould of Ryanair's low-cost business model, which it has 
ruthlessly pursued for more than a decade to achieve the lowest costs and by far the highest profit margins of any 
airline in Europe.
Aer Lingus, as a long-established network carrier, has short- and long-haul operations.
Ryanair in shock Pounds 1bn offer for Aer Lingus * Irish minister says approach would create monopoly
Ryanair has made an all-cash offer of Euros 2.80 a share, valuing Aer Lingus at Euros 1.48bn, which it said 
represented a 27 per cent premium over the initial public offering price of Euros 2.20 and 12 per cent over Aer 
Lingus's Euros 2.51 closing price on Wednesday.
Aer Lingus shares closed last night 15.5 per cent higher at Euros 2.90, while Ryanair closed 3 cents lower at Euros 
8.67.
If the bid were successful, both companies would continue to operate separately and compete on the routes on 
which they both operated - only about 17 of some 500 routes. While there are few direct overlaps on routes airport-
to-airport, both airlines operate in the same wider markets, such as Dublin to London.
Jack O'Connor, president of Siptu, Ireland's biggest trade union, which represents 1,800 Aer Lingus workers, said, 
"If they can pull it off, it will enable Ryanair to take out its principal competitor on their main routes, acquire the 
critically valuable Heathrow slots, consolidate market dominance and dictate whatever price they like to airports, 
with obvious long-term adverse consequences for workers and the travelling public alike."

Transport Minister Martin Cullen has told the Dail the Government is opposed to the Ryanair bid to take over Aer 
Lingus, as it would create a private monopoly in aviation.
He said that would be bad for consumer and for business, and that the regulatory and legal issues were being 
studied.
Green Party TD Eamon Ryan said the sale of the airline had been a foolish, reckless decision by the Government. 
The Minister said the Aer Lingus slots at Heathrow airport could not be sold off, as long as the Government held its 
shareholding. Earlier, the Taoiseach told the Dail the Government would not be selling its shares in Aer Lingus.

Aer Lingus's employee share ownership trust (ESOT) has refuted Ryanair's claim that employees stand to make 
E60,000 from its proposed Aer Lingus takeover.
It said it had no contact with Ryanair ahead of the offer announcement.
In a statement, it said that, contrary to the Ryanair announcement, its E2.80 per share offer would amount to 
'significantly less' than E60,000 per worker.
 This was because of tax law. The ESOT holds around 9.6pc of Aer Lingus and is entitled to buy another 2.9pc. The 
rest of the employees' stake is held individually.

Ryanair's shock bid for Aer Lingus has heated up after it announced it has bought more shares bringing its stake to

Shares in the national airline, which was floated barely a week ago, shot up yesterday amid frantic buying from

Ryanair announced its willingness to pay E2.80 a share for Aer Lingus in a formal cash offer yesterday. At the time 
of making the announcement, Mr O'Leary already had 16pc of the former semi-state company.
 That the share price is now above the level of Ryanair's bid suggests that the market believes the carrier will

Body
The Government is preparing a challenge to Ryanair on competition grounds in an effort to stop its E1.4 billion 
takeover bid for Aer Lingus, according to reports this morning.
Ministers are said to have received legal advice which indicated that Ryanair's surprise approach for Aer Lingus 
could be vulnerable on a range of grounds because the two airlines dominate the Irish market.
The matter is expected to be adjudicated by regulators in the European Commission, which has the power to block 
a takeover or impose a range of restrictions on the two companies.
 Sources believe it may be open to the Government to seek to have the case referred to the Competition Authority 
in Dublin, but it was unclear last night whether it was willing to go down that road. Some sources suggest the 
authority would not have jurisdiction over the case because Ryanair takes in most of its revenues outside Ireland. 
The Irish Times quotes Ryanair as saying yesterday that its offer will lapse if the European Commission challenges 
the takeover on the grounds of concentration of ownership.

Does Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost airline Ryanair, know no bounds when it comes to shaving costs 
from his business?
The official press notice announcing the company's Euros 1.48bn (Pounds 1bn) bid for Aer Lingus, Ireland's smaller 
national carrier, was helpfully posted on Ryanair's website, saving a fortune on printing paper copies. Just as well, 
since the full document ran to 31 pages.
However, journalists were less than impressed when they called the press office number given on the media 
release and found themselves stuck on the end of a recorded message asking if they would like to make a ticket 
reservation.
Luckily Mudlark found a number for Ryanair's external PR agency.
If only such a solution was available to Ryanair customers, who often have little choice but to sit on hold, waiting to 
be connected to a customer service representative as their phone bill mounts up.

Body
Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, launched a surprise takeover bid Thursday for Irish rival 
Aer Lingus Group PLC in a deal that would value the formerly state-owned carrier at 1.48 billion euros ($1.88 
billion).
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said his company had bought more than 16 percent of Aer Lingus over 
the past week and wanted to buy the rest at 2.80 euros ($3.55) a share, a 27 percent premium over Aer Lingus' 
Sept. 27 IPO price of 2.20 euros ($2.79) a share.
Aer Lingus shares soared 13 percent to 2.83 euros ($3.60) in frenetic trading on the Irish Stock Exchange, while 
Ryanair slid 1.8 percent to 8.54 euros ($10.85).
To be successful in gaining a majority stake, analysts said Ryanair almost certainly will have to raise its offer price, 
while other potential suitors particularly British Airways PLC, whose Chief Executive Willie Walsh previously ran Aer 
Lingus might be tempted to build their own stake.
O'Leary pledged to keep Aer Lingus running as a separate company and to respect the powerful role of labor 
unions in the Dublin-based operation a pledge lambasted by union leaders.
But the Ryanair chief said his offer, if accepted, would mean more than 220 million euros ($280 million) in profit for 
an Aer Lingus employee share-ownership trust that controls more than 10 percent of Aer Lingus stock. That would 
equal more than 60,000 euros ($76,000) per employee.
"We believe it's a unique opportunity to put the two leading Irish airlines together into one strong group that would 
be able to compete with Europe and the world," O'Leary said in an interview. He said the combination would carry 
more than 50 million passengers annually and, through Aer Lingus' existing trans-Atlantic routes, expand the range 
and quality of its services to the United States.
O'Leary said he wanted to buy 100 percent of the company if possible and had more than 2 billion euros ($2.6 
billion) in cash reserves to make it happen.
Ryanair launches takeover bid for rival Irish airline Aer Lingus
He said he had already telephoned senior Irish Cabinet ministers to bid for the government's remaining 28 percent 
stake. But he said acquiring 50.1 percent would be sufficient for Ryanair to forge a new aviation alliance with Aer 
Lingus.
Aer Lingus issued a statement saying its board is considering the offer and "will make a statement in due course."
"In the meantime, Aer Lingus Group shareholders are strongly urged to take no action," the company said.
The Irish government immediately ruled out a deal with Ryanair, noting its longstanding determination to retain an 
Aer Lingus stake big enough to block decisions considered detrimental to Ireland's economic competitiveness.
Finance Minister Brian Cowen and Transport Minister Martin Cullen said in a statement that the government 
"remains fully and firmly committed to competition in aviation markets. It will not sell its shares in Aer Lingus."
O'Leary said a Ryanair-controlled Aer Lingus would cut its short-haul fares 10 percent within four years, retain its 
slots at Heathrow the only major London airport that Ryanair does not use and upgrade Aer Lingus' long-haul fleet 
serving U.S. routes.
Labor leaders rejected Ryanair's bid as designed to weaken and eventually gobble up Aer Lingus. They noted 
Ryanair's refusal to recognize unions and frequent confrontations with an unofficial union that represents Ryanair 
pilots.
"Mr. O'Leary is doing what comes naturally to him taking out the only real competitor on his main (Irish) routes as 
well as acquiring the very valuable slots at Heathrow," said Jack O'Connor, president of Ireland's largest union, 
SIPTU.
A union that represents Aer Lingus cabin crew, pilots and middle management, IMPACT, said a Ryanair takeover 
"would create a near-monopoly on passenger air travel in and out of Ireland with obvious adverse implications for 
passengers and society."
"Ryanair has a well-known history of hostility to its staff and shabby treatment of its customers," IMPACT added in a 
statement.
The proposed takeover would face regulatory hurdles in both Ireland and the European Union. Ireland's 
Competition Authority is obliged under law to open an investigation if Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus grows beyond 
25 percent, but the authority said Thursday it had already begun the work.
O'Leary said he expected the major decision to be taken by European competition authorities. Clearing that hurdle 
that shouldn't be a problem, he asserted, citing past EU verdicts permitting mergers that allowed British Airways, Air 
France and Lufthansa to grow on their home soil.
Aer Lingus came close to bankruptcy in 2002 because of a bloated payroll and lost business following the Sept. 11 
terrorist attacks in the United States, traditionally its key profit-making destination. But under the direction of current 
BA chief Walsh, it managed a swift turnaround by slashing staff and moving to a low-frills model emphasizing 
European routes essentially emulating Ryanair's formula.
Aer Lingus, which in Gaelic means "air fleet," was founded by the government in 1936. The airline initially offered 
flights only to England but now connects Ireland to more than 50 European cities; directly to the U.S. cities of 
Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York; and to the Middle East emirate of Dubai.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, launched a surprise takeover bid Thursday for its Irish 
rival, Aer Lingus Group PLC, in a deal that would value the formerly state-owned carrier at â¬1.48 billion (US$1.88 
billion).
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said his company had bought more than 16 percent of Aer Lingus over 
the past week and wanted to buy the rest at â¬2.80 (US$3.55) each, a 27 percent premium over Aer Lingus' Sept. 27 
IPO price of â¬2.20 (US$2.79).
Aer Lingus shares soared 13 percent to â¬2.83 (US$3.60) in frenetic trading on the Irish Stock Exchange, while 
Ryanair slid 1.8 percent to â¬8.54 (US$10.85).
To be successful in gaining a majority stake, analysts said Ryanair almost certainly will have to raise its offer price, 
while other potential suitors particularly British Airways PLC, whose Chief Executive Willie Walsh previously ran Aer 
Lingus might be tempted to build its own stake.
O'Leary pledged to keep Aer Lingus running as a separate company and to respect the powerful role of labor 
unions in the Dublin-based operation a pledge lambasted by union leaders as incredible.
But the Ryanair chief said his offer, if accepted, would mean more than â¬220 million (US$280 million) in profit for an 
Aer Lingus employee share-ownership trust or more than â¬60,000 (US$76,000) per employee that controls more 
than 10 percent of Aer Lingus stock.
"We believe it's a unique opportunity to put the two leading Irish airlines together into one strong group that would 
be able to compete with Europe and the world," O'Leary said in an interview. He said the combination would carry 
more than 50 million passengers annually and, through Aer Lingus' existing trans-Atlantic routes, expand the range 
and quality of its services to the United States.
O'Leary said he wanted to buy 100 percent of the company if possible and had more than â¬2 billion (US$2.6 billion) 
in cash reserves to make it happen.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, offered Thursday to buy Aer Lingus PLC for 1.48 billion

into Ryanair.
Ryanair said it would cut Aer Lingus' short-haul fares by 2.5 percent annually for the next four years; retain the Aer 
Lingus brand and its slots at Heathrow, the only major London airport that Ryanair does not use and upgrade Aer 
Lingus' long-haul fleet serving U.S. routes.
Aer Lingus was floated on the Dublin and London stock exchanges last week.
The company's shares soared about 12 percent in Dublin to 2.82 euros ($3.58). Ryanair's stock slid 2.3 percent to

Transport minister Martin Cullen has declined to say whether he thinks Ryanair will succeed in taking over Aer 
Lingus.
Speaking today, he said "A lot of hurdles have to be crossed before we get to that, so let's see what happens."
He said he understood the concerns expressed by the SIPTU and IMPACT trade unions, which have come out 
against such a takeover.
 Asked if he thought a Ryanair takeover would have to be cleared by the Competition Authority or would be handled 
by Brussels, he said: " I'm going to wait and see what the Competition Authoirty will say. "I don't want to speak for 
them. I don't want to pre-empt what they may say on the matter." The minister's lunchtime comments came after an 
earlier statement from himself and finance minister Brian Cowen, in which they said that the government "remains 
fully and firmly committed to competition in aviation markets. It will not sell its shares in Aer Lingus". Speaking in the 
Dail this morning, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern said : "The government remains fully committed to competition in aviation 
markets and will not be selling its shares in Aer Lingus." He said it was for the board and shareholders of Aer 
Lingus to respond to the offer that has been made, and added: "Any proposal of this kind would require regulatory 
clearance. "It remains to be clarified if this is a matter for the Irish regulatory authorities or the authorities of the 
European Commission."

Body
Ryanair has announced a E1.48bn offer to buy Aer Lingus, saying it already holds 16pc of the airline.
Ryanair said it was offering 2.80 euro per share in cash for the remaining shares in Aer Lingus, which listed on the 
Dublin and London stock markets at the beginning of this week at a price of 2.20 euro per share.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the proposed deal represented 'a unique opportunity to form one 
strong airline group for Ireland and for European consumers'.
 O'Leary said Ryanair would expand, enhance and upgrade the Aer Lingus operations. If successful, the offer 
means both companies will continue to operate separately and compete on the small number of routes on which 
they both operate, currently about 17 of the 500 or so routes operated by the two airlines, he said. 'We believe the 
price of 2.80 euro (per share) to be an excellent offer,' O'Leary said. 'If accepted, the Irish Government will realise 
over 500 m euro from the sale of their Aer Lingus shares and the employees will realise over 220 m euro, which 
equates to an average of over 60,000 euro per employee.' Aer Lingus has made no significant comment on the 
offer. 'The company is not in a position to make any further comment at this time,' a spokesperson for it said. 
However, the Irish government said it remained 'fully and firmly committed to competition in aviation markets' and 
would not sell its 34.8 pc stake. Ryanair chief financial officer Howard Millar said the company believes a deal 
would be unlikely to raise major regulatory issues, according to a report. The budget airline plans to keep the Aer 
Lingus management in place, although some job losses are likely at Aer Lingus, which currently employs 3,500 
people, Millar said. Ryanair said the offer represented a premium of about 27 pc over last week's IPO share price 
and a premium of about 12 pc against yesterday's closing price for Aer Lingus shares of 2.51 euro per share. 
Ryanair said the combined airline group would fly more than 50 million passengers each year and would replicate 
recent European airline mergers such as the link-up between Air France and KLM. The group said it intends to 
reduce Aer Lingus's average short-haul fare of 87.55 euro in 2005 by 2.5 pc a year for a minimum of four years. It 
plans to retain the Aer Lingus brand, its slots at London Heathrow and all profitable routes while cutting its costs

through improved efficiencies and Ryanair's bigger purchasing power. The budget carrier also said it will upgrade 
the flag carrier's transatlantic fleet and improve its long-haul service. Ryanair said in a statement: 'Investing in Aer 
Lingus is attractive for Ryanair and its shareholders because, amongst other things, Aer Lingus's earnings yield is 
superior to the returns currently available on Ryanair's cash deposits. 'Ryanair believes there will be opportunities, 
by combining the purchasing power of Ryanair and Aer Lingus, to reduce operating costs, to increase efficiencies 
and to pass on these savings in the form of low fares to the travelling public.' Analyst Andrew Fitchie at Collins 
Stewart in London described the move as a 'masterstroke' by Ryanair, provided it can get the approval of regulators 
and Aer Lingus' employee share trust. The budget airline would be able to secure more capacity to expand at 
Dublin airport by cutting Aer Lingus' unprofitable routes, he said. Ryanair would also be able to better manage the 
flag carrier's fleet expansion through its superior buying power. 'If they can do this, I think it will be good news for 
Ryanair,' Fitchie said.

US stocks fell today despite strength in retailers' September sales. In the opening minutes, the Dow Jones

OPEC today moved to cut production by a million barrels a day, sending crude futures back above the USD60-a-

 Also, cooler weather, falling gasoline prices and a burst of late back-to-school shopping gave a boost to retailers' 
sales in September. A few companies released earnings today as well, including Marriott International and 
Constellation Brands. Drugmaker Wyeth lifted its earnings guidance for the year, citing the success of key 
pharmaceutical products. The Labour Department reported today that 302,000 persons filed claims last week, the 
smallest number to show up at unemployment offices since the week ending July 22. A gauge of online U.S. 
employment recruitment slipped in September on reduced demand in the finance and real estate sectors. The 
Monster employment index fell to 172 in September from a record 173 in August, the online recruiting company said 
Thursday. The U.S. dollar was flat against the euro and slightly weaker against the Japanese yen. The dollar's 
move comes ahead of a European Central Bank interest rate decision, in which the Frankfurt bank is expected to lift

Ryanair's sees a takeover of Aer Lingus as a unique opportunity to form one strong airline group for Ireland and for 
European customers, its chief executive Michael O' Leary said today. 
Making the announcement of the takeover bid at a press conference this morning, Mr. O'Leary claimed that Ryanair 
would expand, enhance and upgrade Aer Lingus operations. 
He said, "the offer, if successful, means that both companies will continue to operate separately and compete 
vigorously in the small number of routes that which we both operate."
 Ryanair said in a statement that the bid to buy Aer Lingus at E2.80 per share was "an excellent offer". "If accepted 
the Irish government will realise over E500m from the sale of their Aer Lingus shares, and the employees will 
realise over E220m which equates to an average of over E60k per employee," Mr. O' Leary said in the statement. 
The Dublin- based carrier also said that is the offer is successful, it intends to reduce Aer Lingus' average shorthaul 
fares by 2.5pc a year for at least four years, reduce fuel surcharges at the airline, retain its Heathrow slots, retain all 
the profitable routes, upgrade the airline's transatlantic fleet and improve its long haul routes. Ryanair said that 
investing in Aer Lingus is attractive for the low fares airline because, among other things, Aer Lingus' earnings are 
superior to the returns currently available on Ryanair's cash deposits. "Ryanair believes there will be opportunities 
to reduce operating costs, to increase efficiencies and to pass on these savings in the form of low fares to the 
travelling public," Ryanair said. Ryanair's chief executive also said that he would be pleased to get a 50.1pc 
majority, despite making an 100pc offer for the company, and would be happy to work alongside the Government, 
which holds more than 28pc. Ryanair said that a newly merged airline would establish an Irish airline group with 
over 50m passengers annually, capable of competing with the likes of Lufthansa/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), 
France/KLM (70m passengers) and BA/Iberia (63m passengers). "There are numerous precedents across Europe 
for two airlines of similar nationality coming together to form a stronger, more widely diversified airline group. The 
Aer Lingus :O'Leary backs bid at briefing
EU has recognised the value of competitive European airline consolidation because of the benefits, which it brings 
to consumer," Ryanair said. "This offer- if successful- will result in that precedent begin largely replicated here in 
Ireland and elsewhere, with the added benefit that customer of Aer Lingus will enjoy lower fares in the short haul 
market, a better product and service in the long haul market by reducing fuel surcharges as oil prices fall, as 
Ryanair applies its philosophy of lower costs and lower fares to Aer Lingus' existing business."

Body
The trade union that represents Aer Lingus cabin crew, IMPACT, is opposed to the proposed Ryanair takeover of 
Aer Lingus, it said today.
The union said in a statement that it believes that an independent stand-alone Aer Lingus is in the best interests of 
the company, the country, passengers and staff.
"Ryanair has a well-known history of hostility to its staff and shabby treatment of its customers, which is 
unacceptable to IMPACT," the union said. 
 IMPACT said that the proposal faces significant obstacles. "There are clearly significant competition issues 
involved in the proposed takeover, which would create a near-monopoly on passenger air travel in and out of 
Ireland with obvious adverse implications for passengers and society. The Competition Authority would be obliged 
to consider the situation if Ryanair's Aer Lingus stake reaches 25pc." "It is also possible that Ryanair's motive in 
taking a significant shareholding in the company is to divert the management of its main Irish competitor as it begins 
a substantial investment and expansion programme. IMPACT calls on the Aer Lingus board to restate its 
commitment to that expansion programme, which staff have fully supported, and continue work on its 
implementation." The union welcomed the Government's statement that it will not sell its 25pc stake in the 
company, however, it said that today's situation is a direct result of the Government's part-privatisation of Aer 
Lingus, which IMPACT and other Aer Lingus unions opposed. "This is a very fluid and uncertain situation. IMPACT 
will be taking further advice in the coming days and will be keeping its members informed of significant

Aer Lingus takes off as Ryanair flies in with bid

Irish airline Aer Lingus jetted into the stock market on Monday and now looks like taking off as part of rival Ryanair 
in what could be the fastest turnaround in corporate history.
Ryanair has acquired a 16% stake in the Aer Lingus Group and is planning a 2.80 cash bid for the outstanding 84% 
valuing the newly-quoted group at 1.481 billion. The offer is conditional on Ryanair obtaining a majority of the Aer 
Lingus shares.
Investors taking up the 2.20 a share offer in last week's flotation stand to make a quick 27% profit. Ryanair's offer is 
12% over Wednesday's closing price of 2.51.
Ryanair's (RYA) 84.8 million share stake was acquired at an average price of 2.42 a share. Its buying spree clearly 
had much to do with the rising Aer Lingus (AERL) share price which fell from 2.48 to 2.41 on the days Ryanair was 
not buying, Monday and Tuesday.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, says if the bid is successful both companies will continue to operate 
separately and compete on the 17 routes they both run.
If it goes through, the bid gives Europe's largest low-fares airline access to transatlantic routes for the first time and 
these services will be improved and the fleet upgraded as Ryanair believes they have not in recent years kept pace 
with the competition.
Should the Ryanair bid be accepted the Irish Government will realise over 500 million from the sale of its Aer Lingus 
shares. The employees will share over 220 million, an average of over 60,000 per person.
O'Leary says the Ryanair bid represents 'a unique opportunity to form one strong airline group for Ireland'. It would 
have over 50 million passengers a year and complete with the likes of Lufthansa and Air France.
It is seen as being a good deal for Ireland whose tourism industry in particular and economic in general is partly 
dependant on low-fare air services.
Costs will come down as Aer Lingus adopts Ryanair systems and gets the benefit of its greater purchasing power 
and lower cost aircraft.
Aer Lingus takes off as Ryanair flies in with bid
Ryanair shares fell 0.188 to -8.523 on the news giving it a stock market value of 6.6 billion. Aer Lingus shares rose 
0.28 to the bid price of 2.80 with 20 million shares changing hands.
Aer Lingus' average short-haul fares are seen by Ryanair as being 'far too high' and will come down by 2.5% a year 
for a minimum of four years and its fuel surcharges will reduce as oil prices fall.
The Aer Lingus brand will be retained along with all its profitable routes and the landing slots at London Heathrow. 
Its 35 aircraft operate 11 routes to the UK, 57 to Continental Europe, nine to the US and one to the United Arab 
Emirates.
In the year to 31 December 2005 Aer Lingus turnover was just over 1 billion and its profit before tax 100 million; for 
the six months to 30 June the figures were 508 million and 5.2 million respectively.
Ryanair's fleet of 107 aircraft operate 305 routes and run over 750 short-haul flights a day to 115 locations, 24 of 
them in the UK and Ireland. It had a turnover and operating profit before taxation of 1.7 billion and 375 million 
respectively in the year to 31 March.

Bid fever returned to the stock market as a number of big names look poised to go under the hammer.
Much of the action was taking place the other side of the Irish Sea as Northern Ireland power giant Viridian soared 
on a bid approach while no frills airline Ryanair launched a cheeky bid for market newcomer Aer Lingus.
At home dealers breathed a sigh of relief after the Bank of England decided to leave interest rates unchanged at 
4.75% for the second month running. However, many believe November could signal a rise. In Euroland as 
predicted rates rose 0.25% to 3.25%.
A flurry of corporate activity pushed the FTSE 100 up to an early 6016 peak but it failed to hold the high ground 
closing 38 higher at 6004.50 but still above the 6,000 level for the first time in nearly five months.
The other key indices moved ahead, notably the FTSE 250 up 122.40 at 10,128.60.
The 350 was 22.50 ahead at 3129.20. The Dow Jones failed to maintain its spirited 123 overnight advance to 
11,850 and remained in negative territory as London closed.
Steel giant Corus set the mood advancing powerfully to 470p, up 62p, after India's private steel maker Tata 
revealed it was looking at acquisition opportunities including the Anglo Dutch group.
Ryanair launched a Â£1billion hostile bid for rival Aer Lingus after picking up a 16% stake. Ryanair, unchanged at 
8.65 euros, is offering 2.80 euros for Aer Lingus, which soared 15% to 2.9 euros. Aer Lingus says Ryanair should 
leave it alone and the Irish Government, which owns 34%, says it will not accept the offer.
Viridian rocketed 132p or 12% to Â£12.32 valuing it at Â£1.5 billion after confirming an approach almost certainly from 
private equity firms. One analyst suggested however that one of the Scottish electricity groups, Scottish Power or 
Scottish & Southern Energy, could also be involved.
Other takeover favourites were also better. Prudential went 9p better in early trading on rumours that the US 
insurance giant AIG is considering making an offer. The Pru failed to hold the gains and drifted 4p lower at 646p at 
the close. Building materials group Hanson advanced a further 7p to 737p on talk of a US-based bid.
Thursday Closing Market: Bid fever breaks out
Vodafone paused for breath after hosting a successful investor and analyst presentation on its Italian and Spanish 
operations. Morgan Stanley has raised its target price to 146p and Merrill 153p. In the market they eased 1p at 
126p.
PartyGaming gave up another 0.25p at 40p as it prepares to nosedive out of the FTSE following the sector wide 
share price collapse triggered by US action to stop gamblers paying for on-line betting. Among smaller players 
ukbetting gained 6p to 61p on a bid approach. It does not have any involvement in the US.
An upbeat note from broker Investec pushed software group LogicaCMG up 5p at 164p. The broker has a target 
price of 187p.
Insolvency expert Begbies Traynor jumped 12p to 153p after saying it was unaware of any reason for the recent 
price fall.
Former cash shell Mid-States started trading on AIM after the acquisitions of Inov8 and Moving Sun to turn itself 
into an environmental technology company. The shares gained 1.75p to 17.25p.
Sterling was a shade weaker against the dollar at 1.8863 and also lost slight ground against the euro at 1.4842.

The Taoiseach told opposition TD's that they would have to wait until next week to debate the offer.
Mr. Ahern said the move by the no- frills airline was unexpected. He said the Government remains fully committed

 He said it was a matter for the board of the airline to examine and would need regulatory clearance from either the

afternoon. 
This comes after the announcement by Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary that his company had acquired 
over 16pc of Aer Lingus and was making a bid for total control.
Aer Lingus chairman John Sharman said the bid by the no- frills airline was 'unsolicited' and 'opportunistic' saying it 
undervalued the airline's business and growth potential.
 Mr Sharman also said the offer would raise significant competition issues because of Aer Lingus's strong position 
in its main markets. It 'strongly urged' shareholders to take no action.

Body
Ryanair shares have bounced back from early falls to go 1.7pc up this afternoon as investors digest the company's 
takeover plans for Aer Lingus.
Its shares were 15c ahead in Dublin at 885 a short time ago, having initially gone 19c lower to 851 this morning on 
its announcement.
Aer Lingus shares, for their part, have gone further ahead as the day progressed.
 They had risen 29c in early trade to a level of 280, which is the price that Ryanair has offered in its announcement. 
However, as the day has gone on, they have risen further. By this afternoon they were 35c up (+13.9pc) at 286. 
The futher rise indicates that someone thinks they are worth more than what Ryanair offered in its announcement. 
With so many of the stockbroking community in Dublin having been involved in one way or another in the Aer 
Lingus flotation, it was difficult to get a handle today on what exactly is happening in the market. However, it is a fair 
bet that Ryanair is in the market trying to raise the 16pc stake it confirmed this morning that it already holds.

This comes after the announcement by Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary that his company had acquired 
over 16pc of Aer Lingus and was making a bid for total control.
"It makes very good business sense for Michael O'Leary and his heavily financed Ryanair. If they can pull it off it will 
enable Ryanair to take out its principal competitor on their main routes, acquire the critically valuable Heathrow 
'slots', consolidate market dominance and dictate whatever price they like to airports, with obvious long term 
adverse consequences for workers and the travelling public alike," Mr. O'Connor said.
 "Are we really expected to believe that a highly resourced state apparatus and the Government itself could not 
have foreseen this sort of development, which a mere trade union like ourselves warned against long ago. Ironically 
we now have a measure undertaken in the name of competition which, if Ryanair pulls off this takeover, will have 
precisely the opposite effect."

Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary this morning said that he wants 100pc of Aer Lingus but would settle for

E1.48bn.
'We have enough cash in our coffers to pay for this without going to the market,' Mr O'Leary said.
 'This is a compelling off, the Government could realise E500m and the staff shareholders could make E220m from 
this offer,' he aded. 'That's just over E60,000 per employee,' he said. 'The combined airlines would operate 
separately and compete vigorously. We currently only compete on 17 short haul routes with Aer Lingus and there is 
a great potential for synergies and cost savings in the deal,' he said. 'We would have no problem with a unionised

Body
Ryanair's attempt to buy Aer Lingus would be a disaster for passengers and the Government must use every 
means possible to prevent it, Fine Gael Transport Spokeswoman Olivia Mitchell said today.
Ms. Mitchell said that a take-over by Ryanair would result in a single dominant airline in the Irish market and 
immediately wipe out competition on British and European routes.
"The competitive circumstances, which grew both Ryanair and Aer Lingus into successful and profitable companies, 
would no longer pertain in the Irish market," she said. 
 "The Government must use all its persuasive powers in making strenuous representations to the European 
Commission," she said. "Competition in the aviation sector is essential for our island economy. No one wants to go 
back to the dark days of a single major airline. The message to Europe must be that our island status makes 
competition on the island of greater importance to Irish citizens than European competition on its own." Ms. Mitchell 
called on the Dublin Airport Authority should actively seek business from other airlines in order to reduce our 
reliance on the two major players whose interests may not necessarily coincide with the national interest.

 The cash offer is a premium of 27pc over last week's flotation price of E2.20 per share. Ryanair says the combined

of competing on the European and World stage against other large European airline groups, including 
Lufthansa/SAS/Swiss, Air France/KLM and BA/Iberia. 'This offer represents a unique opportunity to form one strong

Europe?s regional airlines are flying fuller aircraft than ever, as the sector rebounds strongly from the 9/11 downturn 
with turboprops in particular enjoying a renaissance.
European Regions Airline Association director-general Mike Ambrose said at ERA?s general assembly in 
Barcelona last week that business is booming for regional carriers.
Scheduled passenger traffic among ERA members is up 8.2% in the first half of this year compared with 2005, says 
the ERA.
Passenger load factors are also up to a record 62%, raising the bar from last year?s record of 59.8%. The number 
of seats in the marketplace has increased 5.1% and available seat kilometres by 5.9%.
European manufacturer ATR illustrates the resurgence in demand for turboprop short-haul transport aircraft, taking 
52 orders for new aircraft in the first nine months, and on 8 September it delivered its 700th of the ATR 42/72 
series. The manufacturer has an order backlog of 130 aircraft.
Irish ATR operator Aer Arann?s chairman Padraigh O?Ceidigh says the prophesised demise of the turboprop never 
materialised, and indeed the type is back in its element, serving routes profitably on which the low-cost jet operators 
cannot make money.
He quotes Cork-Dublin as an example, where he says Aer Arann makes a profit with ATR 72s, carrying load factors

Turboprops resurgent in European market
Now Saab has announced the largest single lease deal ever for its 340Bplus, with Australian regional carrier 
Regional Express (Rex) having signed for 25 of the type, and the biggest deal for the 340 since it went out of 
production, says Saab. The aircraft features a redesigned extended wing that increases flight performance and 
improves fuel efficiency.
Rex managing director Geoff Breust says: ?Rex has been finding it increasingly difficult to respond to numerous 
requests from regional Australia for quality air services. These aircraft present Rex with the opportunity to undertake 
a bold commitment to expanding our services to regional Australia.?
The 340Bplus fleet will enter service with the airline over the next three years. Rex already operates 30 Saab 340s.

Europe? regional airlines are flying fuller aircraft than ever, as the sector rebounds strongly from the 9/11 downturn 
with turboprops in particular enjoying a renaissance.
European Regions Airline Association director-general Mike Ambrose said at ERA? general assembly in Barcelona 
last week that business is booming for regional carriers.
Scheduled passenger traffic among ERA members is up 8.2% in the first half of this year compared with 2005, says 
the ERA.
Passenger load factors are also up to a record 62%, raising the bar from last year? record of 59.8%. The number of 
seats in the marketplace has increased 5.1% and available seat kilometres by 5.9%.
European manufacturer ATR illustrates the resurgence in demand for turboprop short-haul transport aircraft, taking 
52 orders for new aircraft in the first nine months, and on 8 September it delivered its 700th of the ATR 42/72 
series. The manufacturer has an order backlog of 130 aircraft.
Irish ATR operator Aer Arann? chairman Padraigh O?Ceidigh says the prophesised demise of the turboprop never 
materialised, and indeed the type is back in its element, serving routes profitably on which the low-cost jet operators 
cannot make money.
He quotes Cork-Dublin as an example, where he says Aer Arann makes a profit with ATR 72s, carrying load factors 
around 80%, while Ryanair runs a loss leader with Boeing 737-800s at load factors between 50% and 60%.
?Everyone thought jets would provide the sex appeal the marketing departments could work with,? says O?Ceidigh,

Shares of Ireland's Aer Lingus airline traded above their offering price Monday in their first day of unrestricted 
trading, five days after the government sold most of its stake in the Dublin-based carrier.
Aer Lingus Group PLC shares began trading at 2.48 euros ($3.14) on the Irish Stock Exchange, 13 percent higher 
than their 2.20 euro ($2.79) offering price fixed jointly by the company and government Wednesday. By closing, the 
shares had slipped to 2.44 euros ($3.09), still 10.9 percent higher than the flotation price, as some investors 
dumped their holdings for a quick profit.
The shares rose in unofficial trade from Wednesday to Friday, when buyers and sellers could register but not 
complete transactions. Those deals were cleared Monday morning.
The government netted about 200 million euros ($260 million) from Wednesday's sale and retained more than 28 
percent of Aer Lingus shares. The company said it raised more than 470 million euros ($600 million), which it plans 
to use to secure 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in loans and buy new aircraft.
Economists said the government priced the Aer Lingus flotation conservatively because of concerns over terrorism, 
the high cost of oil, and Aer Lingus' head-to-head competition on European routes with Dublin-based Ryanair, the 
leading no-frills carrier in Europe.
"Flotations are routinely priced at a discount in order to ensure success, but the increase in the price seen in the 
past few days suggests the government and its advisers erred on the side of caution," The Irish Times newspaper 
said in an editorial.

Shares in Aer Lingus Group PLC, the former state-owned Irish airline, fell 1.2 percent Monday on their first day of 
unrestricted trading to close at â¬2.45 (US$3.11), but remained 11 percent higher than last week's initial public 
offering.
The government on Wednesday sold most of its stake in the airline for â¬2.20 (US$2.79) a share, at the lower end of 
expectations. The stock rose 13 percent to â¬2.48 (US$3.15) in unofficial trade last week, when buyers and sellers 
could register but not complete transactions.
The backlog of deals was cleared Monday, when profit-taking knocked â¬0.03 (US$0.04) off the share price.
The government netted about â¬200 million (US$260 million) from the sale and retained more than 28 percent of Aer 
Lingus shares. The company said it raised more than â¬470 million (US$600 million), which it plans to use to secure 
â¬2 billion (US$2.6 billion) in loans and buy new aircraft.
Economists said the government priced the Aer Lingus flotation conservatively because of concerns over terrorism, 
the high cost of oil, and direct competition with Dublin-based Ryanair, Europe's leading no-frills carrier.
"Flotations are routinely priced at a discount in order to ensure success, but the increase in the price seen in the 
past few days suggests the government and its advisers erred on the side of caution," The Irish Times newspaper 
said in an editorial.
The Aer Lingus privatization was the first in Ireland since 1999, when the government sold the Eircom telephone 
monopoly months before telecom shares plummeted worldwide as the speculative bubble in high-tech stocks burst. 
Tens of thousands of small-time Irish investors lost about two-thirds of their investment.

Shares on the Dublin market were marginally down this morning 
Around midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 15.78 at 8208.06. 
Financial shares put in a mixed performance. AIB fell 10c to 20.90 and Anglo Irish Bank climbed 10c to 13.05. Bank 
of Ireland dropped 3c 15.39 while Irish Life and Permanent remained flat at 19.76. 
 Shares in the construction sector put in a solid performance with the exception of Kingspan, which fell 5c to 16.20. 
CRH rose 26.66 and Grafton climbed 15c 10.55. McInerney was unchanged at 12.80. Elsewhere, bookmaker 
Paddy Power dropped 20c to 14.60 after US lawmakers effectively banned Internet gambling. In terms of Paddy 
Power, it does not accept play from the US, so this legislation has no direct impact on the group. However, 
competition in the European online gaming space may become more intense as PartyGaming, 888 Holdings and 
SportingBet will now have to concentrate on the European market more, as it is now highly likely that they can no 
longer operate in the US. Other notable movers included no- frills airline Ryanair rose 4c to 8.48 and Irish 
pharmaceutical company Elan, which fell 19c to 12.01. Elan today reported that new data show that its flagship 
multiple sclerosis drug, Tysabri, has a sustained effect on relapse rates in MS patients treated for up to three years.

Employers warned to mind their language Lawyers expect age discrimination claims to increase under the new

The kind of pressure exerted by BP directors to persuade Lord Browne to step down as chief executive of the 
energy group when he turns 60 will become illegal from tomorrow under under new age discrimination laws.
The new rules, which will prevent employers specifying age when recruiting, promoting or training staff, and ban 
compulsory retirement on age grounds for workers below the age of 65, are among the issues to which employers 
need to be alert, lawyers are warning.
Stephanie Dale of Stevens & Bolton says terms such as "dynamic", "vibrant" and "lots of energy" should be 
excluded from recruitment advertisements because they could be construed as a coded appeal for youth.
Employers calling for "experience" in job specifications will also have to be careful younger candidates do not feel 
they have been excluded unfairly. Employers must be able to justify why experience is essential and supply details 
of the training and qualifications required, says Ms Dale.
Ryanair was fined IPounds 8,000 in 2001 in the Irish Republic after the low-cost airline placed a job advert in the 
Irish Times for a "young" and "dynamic" professional.
It is not just over the wording of job adverts where companies have to be careful. Another Irish complainant got 
Euros 40,000 for failing to win promotion at the Department of Health and Children after it was discovered it had not 
appointed a candidate aged over 50 to principal or assistant principal officer in more than three years.
Asda, the supermarket chain, last month announced it would no longer ask job candidates to provide a date of birth 
on application forms to "reinforce the fact that age does not play any part in its recruitment process".
Employment lawyers have warned that the traditional career fairs at universities could be challenged on age 
discrimination grounds.
Employers warned to mind their language Lawyers expect age discrimination claims to increase under the new 
regulations, writes Andrew Taylor
They expect a surge of legal cases as a result of the new rules and warn companies could be vulnerable to 
"ambulance-chasing" applications from older out-of-work candidates whose main aim is to launch a legal case 
when they are rejected. There are no limits on age discrimination compensation under the law.
Heyday, a body established by Age Concern, the charity, is seeking a judicial review over legislation that would still 
allow employers to force people to leave jobs at 65 provided managers had considered properly requests to work 
longer. It says the rule has failed to implement fully a European Union directive outlawing age discrimination.
The government has also been forced to agree to a two-month delay in applying new age discrimination pension 
provision rules, affecting nearly 10m employees. James Purnell, minister for pensions reform, said the delay would 
"allow a short informal consultation period to assess whether any amendments are required to provide greater 
clarity for schemes and employers".
At risk are favourable pension arrangements for older workers taking early retirement. Enhanced arrangements for 
directors and other senior executives could also be a casualty, says Lovells, the law firm.
Businesses making their own arrangements to provide enhanced redundancy payments for older staff could also 
face problems, says Lewis Silkin, the law firm.
The government has ruled that older workers can continue to receive higher rates of statutory redundancy pay, 
without falling foul of the European Union directive because they are likely to find it harder than younger people to 
get a similar job. But many redundancy schemes offer different arrangements and structures and it is not clear 
whether some of these will be allowed under new rules.
Some employee share schemes could be at risk, says Addleshaw Goddard, the law firm. Claims for discrimination 
could arise if older workers taking early retirement are still allowed to receive shares due to be vested after they 
have left the company and young workers, simply quitting to go to another job, are not offered the same benefit.
Share plans based on qualifying periods of service may also have to be revised. Employers similarly will have to be 
able to justify longer notice periods provided for older workers.
Employers will also have to think carefully about employee insurance schemes if premiums are going to rise sharply 
to cover workers kept on beyond current retirement ages.
Lawyers it would seem are likely to be kept very busy.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest budget airline, said Friday that it was raising its full-year profit forecast 
because of lower fuel prices and expanding routes, and confirmed orders for 32 more Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
In Dublin, Ryanair shares rose 1.9 percent to 8.44 euros ($10.71) on the Irish Stock Exchange.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair expected to report net profits for the year ending March 31, 2007, of 
335 million euros ($425 million), up 11 percent. Its previous forecasts projected net profit growth of 5 percent to 10 
percent.
O'Leary said the Dublin-based airline expected its passenger numbers to grow 22 percent 2 percentage points 
more than previously expected to 42.5 million in this fiscal year "based on our aircraft delivery program, our new 
routes and bases."
Previous passenger-volume forecasts excluded the full impact of a new base opening next month in Marseille, 
southern France. Ryanair said it also plans to open a new base in Bremen, its second hub in Germany, in April. 
O'Leary said the airline was adding 106 routes across Europe and North Africa this winter.
He noted that Ryanair earlier this week purchased advance contracts for aviation fuel at a cost of $73 a barrel more 
than the current price of $62.25, but less than previous Ryanair forecasts based on oil prices nearer $80.
As a result, he said, Ryanair was forecasting that its "yield" the average profit per ticket sold would decline by just 5 
percent in this fiscal year, at the lower end of Ryanair's previously cited forecast of 5 percent to 10 percent.
O'Leary also announced that Ryanair was exercising options negotiated in 2005 to buy 32 more Boeing 737-800 
aircraft from the U.S. manufacturer for delivery from September 2008 to June 2009.
Ryanair, whose fleet is composed exclusively of Boeing 737-800s with an average seat capacity of 160, said it has 
received or placed firm orders for 281 of the aircraft, about 15 percent of Boeing's total worldwide order book.
Ryanair raises profit forecast, orders 32 Boeings
Boeing said the 737-800 had a list price of $70 million each, but the manufacturer and Boeing declined to specify 
what discount Ryanair was receiving under terms of its conditional 2005 bulk order.
O'Leary said the newest variant of the 737-800 boasts "all of the latest technological advances in engine type, 
aerodynamics and blended winglets, which ensure maximum fuel efficiency and have allowed Ryanair to reduce 
fuel burn by 45 percent and cut (carbon dioxide) emissions by 50 percent per seat."

IAWS led a sluggish Dublin market a touch higher this morning.
Shortly after midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 13.77 points to 8209.59.
The gains in Dublin were in line with other European bourses, which were buoyed by a drop in oil prices and strong 
gains on Wall Street last night.
 Dealers said that while some caution remained ahead of key US data later today, the tone was broadly positive 
after the Dow Jones briefly traded above its record high close of 11,722.98 on Thursday a record which was set on 
January 14, 2000. Investors will today be looking closely at US August consumer spending and the University of 
Michigan consumer sentiment reading for September. "We are at the end of the quarter and so we are in a period 
of window-dressing which usually benefits stock markets," one dealer said. Shares in Petroceltic jumped by over a 
third after it announced a narrowing of interim losses. It said that net losses in the six months to June eased to 
USD144,000 from 1.16m last time as turnover rose to USD609,577 from USD329,000. Investors were also buoyed 
by the words of chief executive, John Craven, who said that the group has enough funds to proceed with its drilling 
plans, having raised USD40m from a share sale in April. "We can all look forward to an exciting future," he said. 
Shares in Petroceltic were up 6c to 0.24. Still with exploration, shares in Glencar Mining were up 3.5pc after it 
issued an upbeat statement about its prospects in Mali. The firm said that its exploration programme in Mali is 
"entering a very exciting phase". Elsewhere, IAWS was one of the biggest gainers in the morning session, climbing 
32c to 14.82. The food group announced earlier in the week that, for the financial year 2006, turnover grew by 7pc

were mixed. AIB made marginal headway, tacking on 8c to 21.00, while Bank of Ireland added on 1c to 15.40. Irish 
Life and Permanent slipped 6c to 19.78, while Anglo Irish Bank was unchanged on 12.90. Construction shares

gains for the second consecutive day, tacking on 14c to 10.68, while insurance group FBD Holdings was up 30c to 
38.00. No-frills airline Ryanair was up 7c to 8.35, as investors wait to hear whether Michael O'Leary sheds any 
further light on its Q3 outlook at a conference in New York later today. Investors were also buoyed after it 
announced plans on Thursday to expand the number of routes from its Barcelona base by 17 to 40. Ryanair will 
invest a total of USD280m in the expansion.

Ryanair has raised its full year net profit guidance 335m euro (+11pc on last year).
It had previously been guiding +5pc to +10pc.
The airline has also announced that it is ordering a further 32 Boeing 737-800 series aircraft, bringing the total 
number of its firm orders for Boeing 737-800s to 281.
 The 32 next generation aircraft are due for delivery between September 2008 and June 2009. Ryanair says they 
will allow double digit annual growth from 42m passengers this year to 84m passengers in 2012. At that point, it 
says, it will be Europe's largest international airline. These orders are the conversion of options agreed with Boeing 
in 2005. Announcing this increased guidance and firm order today in New York, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO 
said: "Our outlook for this winter remains cautious. This winter we will launch 106 new routes and new bases at 
Marseilles and Bremen. "We have also hedged our fuel requirements for Q4 at an average cost of USD 73 per 
barrel, lower than we had originally anticipated. "Based on our aircraft delivery programme, our new routes and 
bases, we anticipate that passenger growth will be slightly higher at 22pc (previously 20pc) to 42.5m for the full 
year. "We anticipate that our loss making competitors will continue to dump fares. "We also expect slightly lower 
load factors (down 2pc on last year) during H2 which will give improved yield stability in the winter period. "This will 
result in the decline in forecast yields being closer to 5pc which is at the lower end of the (-5pc to -10pc) range we 
previously guided. "As a result of these factors we believe that the increase in net profit after tax for the fiscal year 
will be approximately 11pc to E335m, slightly higher than our previous (+5pc to +10pc) range of profit guidance.

European markets have been more than usually led by Wall Street this week and in London today buyers held back 
for a string of US inflation indicators instead of ending the quarter by pushing the FTSE 100 confidently through the 
6,000 mark.
Although the FTSE did break through the psychologically significant barrier with 6,002.9 at 0919, the weakness of 
mining stocks meant that the high couldn't be maintained.
Prices slipped back to a day's 1152 low of 5,959.9 before rallying to 5,982 at 2.19 pm, up 10.7 points. Trade was 
only moderate with 1.14 billion shares changing hands in 143,920 deals.
The weakest mining stock was Vedanta, down 10p to Â£11.83, although Lonmin was another loser, down 13p to 
Â£25.85. Antofagasta was the best performing miner, up 2.25p to 458p.
Although Wall Street did well overnight, it failed to close above record levels as the evidence builds that the US is 
economy is slowing down.
It is expected go five points higher in early trading and hit a new high sometime today although whether it closes 
above the 11,722 all-time high remains to be seen.
Man Group added 9.5p to 452.75p after the group's bullish trading statement forecast half-year profit growth of 
20%. It was second on the FTSE 100 leader board to Hanson, up another 23p to 769p on resistant bid rumours.
Banks were strong with Royal Bank of Scotland up 31p to Â£18.43 and Barclays 6p better at 675.5p.
The names in the frame for the SSL bid speculation are Proctor & Gamble and Schering Plough. SSL raced up to 
361p, but are now 349.625p, up 12.625p with over 2.7 million shares going through the market in 657 deals.
So far talk of a private equity bid for engineering group Charter has come to nothing. The shares raced up 53.5p at 
one point, but settled back to the current 838.25p, 20.25p better on the day so far.
Shares in Ryanair rose 0.285 to 8.573 despite the admission of the group earlier this week to screwing up its fuel 
hedging arrangements and being cautious about winter trading.
At noon in Paris the French CAC-40 was 27.03 points higher at 5,277.04. German shares also broke the 6,000 
barrier, the DAX 30 hitting 6,014.56 in Frankfurt at 1119.

The dollar was firmer in international currency markets partly for technical reasons as dealers balanced their end-of 
quarter-positions. The pound weakened from the overnight $1.8764 to $1.8671. Sterling was also softer against the 
Euro easing from 1.4773 to 1.4737.

close on 2.46, with just under 50 million shares changed hands.
In the financial sector, Irish Life and Permanent was the biggest mover tacking on an impressive 29c to close on

be minimal and remain positive on AIB's longer-term outlook". CRH was trading in the black, up 35c to 26.90, 
buoyed by the news that US new house sales figures grew in August by 4.1pc to an annualised rate of 1.05m units,

strategic milestone by signing its first licence agreement with a US firm for one of its pipeline products. Shares in 
Elan were down 13c to 12.20 despite the pharmaceutical group telling the 22nd Congress of the European

6c to 8.28 as investors await a trading update, due to be released at an investor conference in New York tomorrow. 
Last week Michael O'Leary said that the company remained comfortable with current Q2 and Q3 guidance, adding

outlook for Q2 in New York. Elsewhere today, drinks and snacks group C and C enjoyed strong gains, jumping 29c

Aer Lingus Group PLC, Europe's most profitable national airline, sold shares at â¬2.20 (US$2.79) each Wednesday 
in a flotation which went ahead despite fears that the twin threats of international terrorism and high fuel costs could 
depress demand.
The price was at the lower end of the government's initial forecast of â¬2.10-â¬2.70 (US$2.65-US$3.40), but the 
shares closed up 7.7 percent at â¬2.37 (US$3.00) in restricted trading on the Dublin Stock Exchange. They will go 
on unrestricted sale Monday.
Aer Lingus said it raised â¬471.8 million (US$594.5 million) through the flotation, money it will use to purchase new 
aircraft and expand its route network in Europe, North America, Asia and possibly South Africa. The company said 
its market value was â¬1.13 billion (US$1.43 billion).
The government said it would net about â¬200 million (US$255 million) from the sale of the airline, which nearly went 
bankrupt in 2002 but transformed itself by cutting staff, overhauling its route network and moving to a no-frills 
business model.
Chief Executive Dermot Mannion said Aer Lingus wanted to double its long-haul fleet to 14 aircraft and boost its 
short-haul fleet from 28 aircraft to 42 chiefly to reach more U.S. airports and to expand its European services in 
competition with Dublin-based Ryanair, the no-frills leader in Europe.
Mannion said European Union competition rules restricting the ability of governments to invest in state-owned 
airlines made such expansion plans impossible without privatization. He said the airline now hoped to secure loans 
worth about â¬2 billion (US$2.6 billion) to buy new aircraft over the next five years.
As of Wednesday, Aer Lingus said the government retained a 34.8 percent stake in the airline, banks and other 
institutional investors had 40.3 percent, private investors held 11.6 percent, and an Aer Lingus employees trust the 
rest. As part of the deal, the government which plans to unload more of its holding, reducing it to just above 25 
percent in coming months has earmarked 2.8 percent for sale to the employee trust.
Shares in Ireland 's Aer Lingus airline rise on first day of flotation
The trust, which benefits more than 6,000 current and former employees, saw its traditional 15 percent share in Aer 
Lingus diluted by the flotation and the issuing more than 290 million new shares. But the employees have supported 
the deal on the grounds that their stock is likely to rise in value.
Roy Barrett, managing director of Goodbodys Stockbrokers in Dublin, which advised on the share sale, said 
investor applications exceeded the number of shares available by 3.5 times.
Demand from Irish and British residents, who were required to commit a minimum of â¬10,000 (US$12,600), was 
"exceptionally strong," Barrett said.
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern has spent nine years mulling when and how to privatize Aer Lingus. His government 
hesitated, in part, because of the bad taste left in investors' mouths from its 1999 privatization of state telephone 
company Eircom, in which most retail investors lost two-thirds of their investment.
Ahern also had to ease potential labor-union trouble at Aer Lingus, whose 3,300 employees guard the value of their 
shareholding and fear that their pension rights could be slashed under private ownership.
After months of negotiations, the government agreed to keep a minimum 25.1 percent stake in the airline sufficient, 
it argued, to defend any Aer Lingus services considered essential to Ireland's economic interest. The airline also 
promised to invest an extra â¬104 million (US$131 million) in the workers' pension fund.
Aer Lingus, which in Gaelic means "air fleet," was founded by the government in 1936, 14 years after Ireland won 
independence from Britain. The airline initially offered flights only to England but now connects Ireland to dozens of 
European cities; directly to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in the United States; and to the Middle 
East emirate of Dubai.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, has hedged its fuel requirements for the first three months of next year 
close to the peak of the market.
It warned investors yesterday that it had hedged its fuel requirements for the period from January to March at 
Dollars 73 (Pounds 38.50) per barrel of Brent crude compared with a price in recent days of about Dollars 60 a 
barrel. Forward prices for January deliveries of Brent crude were yesterday about Dollars 62 a barrel.
The airline was still unhedged in early August for the final quarter of its financial year from January to March 2007 
and became increasingly nervous as the oil market reached a new peak of more than Dollars 78 a barrel in the first 
two weeks of August.
By hedging close to the peak oil price, the airline will be unable to take early advantage of the recent steep fall in 
the crude oil price.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said in early August that the group was 90 per cent hedged until the end 
of October at Dollars 70 a barrel and was 90 per cent hedged for November and December at Dollars 74 a barrel.
But Mr O'Leary added it was unhedged for the final quarter of the financial year and was looking for opportunities to 
hedge its outstanding fuel requirements.
Andrew Fitchie, aviation analyst at Collins Stewart, said Ryanair had left itself unhedged for the latter part of its 
financial year to March and had "paid the price".
"It has ended up with one of the highest unit fuel costs in the sector."
However, Mr Fitchie added that it could be a "major beneficiary" of lower oil prices next year, if it locked in around 
current levels.

Ryanair shares fell 6 cents to Euros 8.39.
Separately, the airline said it had opened a new stream of ancillary earnings by signing an exclusive five-year deal 
with InviseoMedia to install and sell seatback advertising across its entire fleet of aircraft, which will total 134 by the 
end of March and 234 by March 2012 based on existing orders.
The airline expects passenger numbers to total 42m in the current year.

Irish discount airline Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday it has hedged its fuel costs from January to March 2007 at 
a price equivalent to US$73 per barrel of oil.
Oil prices rose by more than a dollar yesterday on worries that the recent drop in prices could prompt OPEC to cut 
production. Oil prices are down 21 percent since hitting a record of US$78.40 on July 14.
Fuel is one of Ryanair's greatest costs.
Europe's biggest budget airline said last month it earned â¬115.7 million (US$147.3 million) in the quarter ended 
June 30, compared with â¬69.6 million in the same quarter of 2005.
The Dublin-based company founded in 1985 with a single route linking London to the southeast Irish city of 
Waterford has 3,700 employees and operates 351 routes to 23 countries across Europe.
Separately, Ryanair said it entered a five-year contract with InviseoMedia to install seatback advertising across its 
fleet of 239 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
The so-called Inviseo Table is a backrest tray-table, set with an advertising panel for printed advertisements.
"This product is great news for passengers who can expect even lower fares as advertisers all over Europe 
contribute to lowering the cost of flights," the company said in a statement.
Ryanair shares fell 2.4 percent to â¬8.26 (US$10.56) in Dublin trading.

No- frills airline Ryanair today confirmed that it would oppose Dublin Airport Authority's planned Terminal 2 at 
Dublin Airport.
The airline said that T2 is "badly designed, in the wrong location, is five times more expensive than other similar 
terminal facilities in the UK and Europe, and has ballooned in cost from E170 million to E750 million when the 
DAA's plans were finally revealed in August 2006."
Ryanair also said that it will be opposing any attempt by the DAA to seek a 25pc increase in passenger charges to 
the Commission of Aviation Regulation and will submit a complaint to the Competition Authority calling for an 
investigation into the fourfold increase in T2 costs.
 The airline has also written to the DAA offering to build a low cost, efficient Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport at a cost of 
E250 million Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary today said, "The DAA cannot be trusted to build efficient, low cost 
facilities. Having wasted E150 million on Pier C in 1998 they now propose to scrap it. Having spent a further E150 
million. Extending the Terminal in 2002 "to cater for 20 million passengers" this summer's experience has proven 
that the facilities cannot handle 20 million passengers." Meanwhile, the DAA today expressed their disappointment 
at Ryanair's opposition to the plan. "The DAA will transform the experience of all passengers using Dublin Airport 
within the next three years by delivering, cost-effectively, a major new passenger terminal and a range of other new 
and upgraded facilities, despite the regrettable decision by Ryanair to try to delay these benefits on grounds that 
have no basis or merit."

Drugmakers continued to head the mergers and acquisitions charge yesterday after Belgium's UCB agreed to buy 
Germany's Schwarz Pharma, the third big European bid in the sector in five days.
Schwarz soared 17.7 per cent to Euros 89.07 after UCB said it would buy the company for Euros 4.4bn in cash and 
stock. Credit Suisse said it thought the merger was sensible.
"The key rationale for the merger is near-term pipeline augmentation," said analyst Ravi Mehrotra.
UCB shares fell 0.1 per cent to Euros 47.
On Thursday it was announced that Switzerland's Serono was to sell a controlling stake to Germany's Merck. 
Altana, also of Germany, has announced it is to sell its drugs division to unlisted Nycomed.
The broader sector was buoyed by the announcement. Denmark's Novo Nordisk added 1.3 per cent to DKr432 
while Shire of the UK added 1.9 per cent.
Also in Germany, GPC Biotech shot up nearly40 per cent to Euros 15.01 after announcing positive results from 
phase-three trials for Satraplatin, its treatment for late-stage prostrate cancer.
The company said it expected to submit the drug for US regulatory approval by the end of the year, followed by 
European filing in the first half of 2007.
Crucell fell 4.1 per cent to Euros 17.47 as speculation faded that the Dutch biotech company might soon receive 
regulatory approval for its Quinvaxem childhood diseases vaccine. The shares had initially rallied on hopes that a 
decision would be made this week.
European air carriers welcomed a further weakening of oil prices, but M&A speculation was also in the air after 
Germany's Lufthansa was reported to be seeking acquisitions to capture new markets.
Schwarz leads charge in M&As EUROPE
Early speculation centred on Scandinavian group SAS, but Lufthansa said that comments from its CEO appearing 
in Norwegian press reports had been misinterpreted. SAS shares rallied2.1 per cent to SKr97.
German broker HVB lifted its price target on Lufthansa from Euros 16.45 to Euros 18, highlighting the fall in oil 
prices as well as the company's successful integration of Swiss International Air Lines.
Shares in Lufthansa, however, fell 0.4 per cent to Euros 16.14.
Ryanair, the Irish carrier, gained 3.7 per cent to Euros 8.45.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.1 per cent to 1,370.04, hit by the weight of falling oil stocks after crude prices 
resumed their downward course.
Among the big fallers were Norway's Statoil, down 5 per cent to NKr147.25, and its domestic peer Norsk Hydro, off 
4.5 per cent to NKr138.75.
Finnish refiner Neste Oil shed 3.8 per cent to Euros 21.16.
Industrial metals groups were sharply lower, similarly hit by falling commodities prices.

Ryanair has hedged its fuel requirements for the first three months of 2007 at a rate equivalent to USD73 a barrel of

The move came as a report yesterday said oil prices would probably drift lower in the absence of an OPEC output 
cut amid fading world political tensions.
'As things stand today, further declines in the price are likely unless OPEC somehow manages to reduce its output,' 
the influential Centre for Global Energy Studies said in a monthly report.
 Crude prices sank below USD60 yesterday, hitting their lowest levels since early March as tensions eased over 
Iran and BP said it would resume output at Prudhoe Bay, the biggest oil field in the US. Prices recovered slightly to

British Airways PLC fired another shot Monday at the beleaguered British Airports Authority, calling on regulators to 
cut the charges levied by the operator of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports.
British Airways said the charges hamper efficient investment in new infrastructure and the building of facilities that 
airlines want.
"We operate in a highly competitive environment and our customers want good value for money," BA's economic 
regulation manager Andrew Cunningham said in a speech at the Airport Finance and Investment 2006 Conference.
"We cannot make inefficient investments that drive up our ticket prices to uncompetitive levels," he added. 
"Monopoly airport operators are not under similar pressure."
BAA owns and operates airports that handled 63 percent of air passengers in Britain in 2005. Its airports in 
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen give BAA an 86 percent share in Scotland, while in London, BAA has 92 
percent of the air passenger traffic.
The company is facing heavy criticism from most major airlines of its handling of last month's terror alert, which led 
to hundreds of canceled flights and long delays at airports around the country due to heightened security measures.
BA and no-frills rival Ryanair Holdings PLC have already made submissions to an inquiry by the Office of Fair 
Trading for BAA to be broken up.
BAA has rejected those calls, saying that such a move would hamper, rather than boost, competition in the 
domestic airline industry.
The Office of Fair Trading announced in May that it was considering a full inquiry into the domestic airport market. 
The current process could lead to a possible referral to the Competition Commission.

From the shell of an unfinished villa, through what will eventually be a window overlooking the Atlantic, it is just 
possible to see a small boat and a great deal of splashing out on the dark blue expanse of ocean.
"Oh, another whale," says Roger Still, the development manager of -Palheiro Village, a new residential complex 
that grips one of the famously steep hillsides in Madeira.
Whale-spotting is nothing new for those who know Madeira. They're just one reason why the tiny island - only 57km 
long and 22km wide - seems so exotic, a part of Portugal since the 15th century yet somehow completely un-
European.
It also has those hills, which drop straight into the ocean, leaving no conventional beaches; a striking, craggy 
interior; a year-round temperate climate; an almost obscene abundance of bananas and flowers; and a rich history 
as a post for trade with the US.
The connection to the mainland is clear, of course. The islanders speak Portuguese, the food is Portuguese and the 
local architecture - particularly the island's Gothic churches - is livened up by the decorative Manueline style unique 
to Portugal. There is also a significant British contingent, which arrived in the 17th century and still exerts an 
influence.
Yet the island has not been turned into a typical southern European tourist trap. There are plenty of visitors - 
sipping the fortified wine also known as Madeira, sitting in the island's tea rooms, playing on its golf courses and 
walking the famous levadas inland. But, unlike on the Algarve, the Spanish costas or the French Rivera, the 
presence of sun seekers is not what hits you on arrival. And it's this air of exclusivity - Madeira is neither an Easyjet 
nor a Ryanair destination - that is propelling the island's emergence as a second home market.
Traditionally, anyone interested in owning property on Madeira had to pick from a limited selection of private 
apartments and villas, mostly in Funchal, the pretty, but busy, capital.
Isle with an air of exclusivity Some see Madeira 's hills, climate and lack of budget flights as drawbacks. To 
others they are boons, writes Emma Tucker
One group of upmarket apartments, built next to the island's most famous hotel, Reid's Palace Hotel, attracted a 
mix of foreign and local buyers, and residences there now sell for anything from Euros 450,000 to Euros 500,000. 
But the island has lagged other resort areas in terms of new construction and price rises.
"Madeira offers a better deal simply because it is a much smaller market and there is much less competition 
between buyers," says Tony de Nobrega, an independent estate agent selling homes priced from Euros 170,000 for 
a three-bedroom apartment to Euros 3.1m for a 19th century quinta overlooking Funchal's horseshoe-shaped 
harbour.
The absence of child-friendly beaches and cheap flights, not to mention the island's copious rainfall, are some of 
the reasons developers were reluctant to enter the market. But, thanks to a newly refurbished airport and a big road 
building project, they are starting to recognise the island's potential. "Madeira was a sleeping beauty," Still says. 
"Only in the past 10 years has improved infrastructure made access to the island easier."
The sloping Palheiro Village, an extension of an existing 200-year-old estate with a golf course, country house hotel 
and spa, is the first big second home community of its kind on the island. When complete it will have 32 one- and 
two-bedroom apartments and a number of three- and four-bedroom -villas, some with their own pools; there are 
also 30 large building plots available at the top of the steeply sloping development. Colombo's Resort - a 
development of 193 apartments, 12 villas, a hotel and spa designed by Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill - is 
meanwhile rising on Porto Santo, a 14km by 4km island with nice sandy beaches just off Madeira's north-east 
coast.
So far prices on Madeira remain well below those at competing mainland locations. At Palheiro, where construction 
is under way, homes are selling from Euros 3,200 to Euros 4,000 per sq metre, compared with Euros 4,400 to 
Euros 5,000 per sq metre for new, up-market, off-plan apartments in the Algarve.
Promoters of Madeira argue that its "downsides" - the rain, the lack of sandy beaches and the absence of low-cost 
carriers - will eventually attract second-home buyers because they also serve to keep tourist hordes away. There 
are also strict planning and conservation controls, strengthened over the past 10 to 15 years in response to some of 
the overdevelopment horrors on the Algarve.
Linda Beaney, a partner at her London estate agency, a keen golfer and walker, confirms that she bought a home 
in Palheiro in part because the island is so "grockle-free". "It is very undeveloped. It does have its touristy areas but 
they don't intrude," she says. "I had in mind the possibility of buying a property overseas as an investor that I could 
keep for five to 10 years but also have some fun with."
Ease of access was also important. It takes about four hours to fly to Madeira from most northern European cities 
and Palheiro is just a few minutes outside Funchal, perched above a busy road. "I am not very good at taking long 
holidays and what is terrific is that this is somewhere where I can look at my diary on a Wednesday or Thursday 
and decide to grab three nights at the weekend," she says.
Dublin-based David Lawlor, a father of two in his mid-40s who doesn't play golf, has also bought a plot at Palheiro 
and plans to build a substantial villa with a swimming pool. "The things that always put us off other resorts in 
France, Italy or Spain were that it was too hot in summer or that the resorts were just that - holiday centres that 
existed in kind of bubble," he says. "We saw the place and just loved it. It's just so hard to describe - the air and the 
smells, and the steepness of the hills."

Construction shares led the Dublin market sharply lower today as investors pocketed gains from earlier in the week.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 56.81 points lower on 8140.66.
The falls mirrored those on in the US, where Wall Street was lower again. Investors there remain cautious after the 
Philly Fed revealed on Thursday an unexpected contraction in manufacturing, and with oil prices continuing their 
slow rise from Thursday's six month lows.
 A slowdown in US economic growth and receding fears about this year's Atlantic hurricane season have dragged 
oil down by more than 20pc since the middle of July. Oil prices hovered around USD61 a barrel today. In Dublin, 
the dip in share prices was somewhat inevitable as leading shares have enjoyed a largely positive week thanks to a 
raft of strong trading updates and the decision by the US Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged for the 
second month running. The Fed decision offered a boost to financial shares, with major banks trading in positive 
territory for much of the week. However, the good run came to an end today with all the major banks falling into the 
red. Irish Life and Permanent slipped 7c to close on 19.50, while AIB was down 1c to 2094 and Bank of Ireland 
ended the week on 15.27, down 3c. Anglo Irish Bank dropped 6c to close on 1294. Shares in building materials 
giant CRH have suffered a trying week after figures showed that the pace of housing starts in the US fell 6pc in 
August - twice as fast as expected. Meanwhile, new housing construction notched its fifth decline in six months, 
hitting its lowest point in over three years. Indeed, housing has now replaced inflation as Wall Street's biggest 
worry, with fears that a sharp drop in the sector could cause a spike in unemployment and a slowdown in consumer 
spending. This is particularly bad news for CRH, which gets 50pc of its revenue from the US. Shares in CRH were 
down 55c to 26.40. Elsewhere in the sector, Grafton was down 12c to 10.40, while McInerney slipped 5c to 13.05. 
Kingspan managed to buck the trend, climbing 3c to 15.75. Shares in the food sector were mixed. Kerry Group 
gave away 20c to close on 18.30, while drinks and snacks firm C and C was up 15c to 1065. Investors plundered 
recent gains from Ryanair, down 10c to 820. Shares in the no-frills airline shot up on the drop in oil prices earlier in

on hand luggage at airports. Other notable movers included DCC, down 20c to 19.20, Elan, down 25c to 11.75, 
IAWS, down 23c to 15.57, and South Wharf, down 35c to 6.60. Bookmaker Paddy Power and media group UTV

Airlines warn of security confusion LUGGAGE RESTRICTIONS

Security experts and airlines warned of continuing confusion and passenger disruption as the government eased 
some hand baggage restrictions without international agreement on other measures.
One leading London-based international transport security adviser cautioned that the government was risking giving 
passengers false reassurance about their safety with piecemeal measures aimed at helping curb losses incurred by 
airports and airlines since an alleged terrorist plot last month.
Sally Leivesley, a scientific adviser on emergency planning, told the Financial Times: "Ambiguous messages about 
what is safe to take on to airlines will only confuse the public. What is needed is much greater global co-ordination 
in response to an ongoing terrorist threat."
Separately, airlines gave a mixed reaction to the latest move, arguing a further relaxation of security measures was 
needed to avoid airport congestion.
"We continue to call on the government to restore the body search requirement to the safe and effective levels that 
were in place prior to August 10," said Ryanair, "Failure to do so is causing unnecessary queues." Other airlines 
said they were disappointed the government was maintaining restrictions on liquids and on further hand baggage 
being taken on aircraft leaving the UK, except for a special concession for musical instruments.
BAA, the airports operator, said the easing of restrictions would be in place at its seven airports from the start of 
business today but warned passengers to expect continuing delays and to allow "extra time" for their journeys. It 
said: "This easing of restrictions is not a return to normal. It remains the case that liquids, gels or pastes, toiletries 
and sharp items are forbidden from hand luggage,"
Enhanced security measures for passengers travelling to the US remain in place, meaning passengers will continue 
to be subject to secondary security searches and no toiletries or cosmetics purchased in the departure lounge will 
be allowed on to the aircraft.
Airlines warn of security confusion LUGGAGE RESTRICTIONS
The Department for Transport said: "We will never compromise on the safety of passengers but it's right that we 
continually strive to strike the right balance between properly robust security and arrangements which minimise the 
burden on passengers and business."
Security officials said the tough restrictions brought in last month were in response to intelligence of a specific and 
imminent threat that terrorists might attempt to blow up aircraft flying from the UK to the US.
While several suspects linked to the plot have since been arrested and charged, security officials on both sides of 
the Atlantic argued against too great a relaxation of the security regime.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline may consider setting up a partner company to operate 
long-haul flights between Ireland and the US.
His comments came at Ryanair's annual general meeting where the company announced three new routes from 
Dublin yesterday - to Fuerteventura, Tenerife, Alghero in Sardinia, and Trapani in Sicily, as well as one from Derry 
to Glasgow Prestwick. Mr O'Leary said the airline would travel to 69 destinations from Dublin by next summer.
Asked about the airline's plans to focus on more distant destinations with the introduction of flights to the Canary

some popular holiday destinations.
 Mr O'Leary told shareholders Ryanair expects earnings to be in line with expectations despite disruption following

Dateline: TARFAYA Morocco
Body
In this fishing village on Morocco's southern coast, French writer Antoine de St-Exupery dreamed of the faraway 
worlds visited by his immortal character, the Little Prince. Eighty years on, the haphazard cluster of salmon-colored 
buildings and the crenelated shell of a Spanish fort still oozes charm.
But Shaibata Merebbi Rebbo a native son, local history buff and contact for the United Nations Development 
Program feels the wide world pressing down on his home. He worries that Tarfaya's drowsy sepia-tinted existence 
risks being obliterated by mass tourism as Morocco's skies open to European budget airlines.
"The rhythm of mass tourism is very quick," he said. "All the things that used to be beautiful will change."
This year, Morocco became the first African country to join Europe's flight zone. Loosened controls and slashed 
airport fees led budget pioneer Easyjet to start flights to Marrakech in July, and Irish rival Ryanair is set to arrive in 
late October. Fledgling Moroccan low-costers are joining the action, with startup Jet4you announcing new flights 
from Paris.
To fly to Morocco, Europeans used to have to pay big carriers like Air France, British Airways and Morocco's own 
Royal Air Maroc hundreds of dollars. In a devastating undercut, budget airlines are now offering return tickets from 
Europe for under $60.
Remote Tarfaya is still far from the budget airlines' initial bridgeheads in northern Morocco. But with Ryanair alone 
looking to expand to up to twenty Moroccan destinations, Merebbi Rebbo foresees a lot more foreigners visiting 
Tarfaya in coming years.
He hopes tourism will provide a much-needed economic boost, but also worries about the impact on local lifestyles 
and cultures.
"The municipality would have the money to create green spaces and improve the roads," he said, plodding down a 
dusty alleyway. But tourism must be controlled, he added. "If we need infrastructure to accommodate these people, 
it must respect the local architecture, not build high buildings."
Budget airlines herald promise and peril for Morocco
Some 500 miles to the north in Rabat, Morocco's tranquil capital, Tourism Minister Adil Douiri has ideas strikingly 
similar to Merebbi Rebbo's. In an interview, he said the government hopes to drum up some $7 billion between 
2001 and 2010 to develop major historic cities like Fes and Marrakech as weekend destinations for Europeans and 
attract others to upscale beach resorts for longer, sun-soaked stays. Most of the funding will come from private 
investors, he said.
Morocco hopes tourism will help lower chronic unemployment estimated at 20 percent in cities and modernize an 
economy still heavily grounded in agriculture.
"Tourism is the broadest industry in terms of job creation it's transport, it's retail, it's everything," said the minister.
Key are budget airlines, which the government hopes will significantly boost tourist numbers from 5.8 million in 2005 
to 10 million a year by 2010.
Douiri said tourism will also help rescue crumbling historic towns and walled cities the government is unable to save 
by providing owners with cash to repair buildings and install modern utilities like running water and telephone lines.
Real estate agents are gearing up for more European vacationers and retirees as cheap air fares make commuting 
to and from Europe easier. They expect rents to rise and say developers are already getting ahead by building 
small studios and flats more suited to Westerners than the cavernous apartments meant for traditionally large 
Moroccan families.
Said French real estate agent Olivier Boisard, who caters mainly to French retirees moving to Morocco: "The 
potential is enorme, enorme, enorme!"

Shares in Dublin slipped marginally lower in late deals today, having spent virtually all of the day in the black.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 5.40 points lower on 8197.47. Trading remained light with just 23 million 
shares changing hands.
The main cause of the late falls was a sluggish start to trading in the US.
 Stocks on Wall Street treaded water in the opening hours as investors pondered their next move now that the 
Federal Reserve has decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged. Although the Fed's decision lifted Wall 
Street's spirits and sparked a rally on Wednesday, there is still uneasiness among investors that the Fed's string of 
17 interest rate hikes might have taken too much of a toll on the economy. The Fed began that streak in June 2004 
to keep inflation under control. 'As long as we are data-dependent, the market is going to be vulnerable to some 
significant swings,' said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist and director of asset allocation for Trusco Capital 
Management. 'The Fed has put their stake in the ground with their forecast of decelerating growth and easing future 
inflation pressures,' he said, adding the markets will be nervously awaiting to see whether this scenario plays out. 
He said investors will be keeping a close eye on corporate earnings news in the coming weeks as they try to gauge 
the health of the economy. The news had a mixed effect on financial shares in Dublin today, with AIB down 4c to 
2095 and Bank of Ireland 10c lower on 1530. Irish Life and Permanent excelled however, jumping an impressive 
39c to close on 1957, while Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 4c to 1303. Construction shares lacked any real direction, 
with CRH remaining unchanged on 2700, Grafton up a modest 2c to 1052 and Kingspan up 2c to 1572. McInerney 
closed 10c higher on 1310. Ryanair continued its strong recent trading, climbing 20c to 830 today. Its share price 
has soared over the last few days as oil prices fell below the critical USD60 per barrel level for the first time in six 
months. While prices remained steady today, OPEC's former acting general secretary, Adnan Shihab Eldin, warned 
that prices could drop to as low as USD40 a barrel by mid-2007 over receding geopolitical concerns. However, it 
ruled out a collapse to pre-2003 prices. 'It's possible that the price may dip to USD40, but not this year, maybe in 
ISEQ slips into the red in late trading
2007 and 2008,' depending on geopolitical conflicts, said Eldin, now a top contender for the post of OPEC secretary 
general. Elsewhere in Dublin, investors pocketed gains from most of Wednesday's major gainers. Shares in UTV 
closed 29c lower on 509 after it announced earlier in the week that it was no longer interested in a merger with 
Scotland's SMG. Irish Continental was another faller, slipping 15c to 1085, while Kerry Group fell 5c to 1845 and 
FBD Holdings dropped 20c to close on 3780. Pharmaceutical group Elan slipped 20c to 1200 after it was confirmed 
that its rival Serono had sold a majority stake in the company to German drugmaker Merck for USD13.31bn. The 
Swiss biotech firm also said that its oral cladribine treatment for multiple sclerosis has received 'fast-track' status 
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Bookmaker Paddy Power was up 4c to 1440, while South Wharf 
continued its recent strong trading, closing 19c higher on 695. Meanwhile, ICON was the biggest gainer of the day, 
tacking on an impressive 60c to close on 5435.

Shares on the Dublin market enjoyed a positive morning as oil prices remained low and after the Fed kept interest 
rates on hold last night, hinting that its rate hike cycle has now almost certainly peaked.
Just before midday, the ISEQ was up 37.81 points to 8240.68.
A major drop in oil prices, below the USD60 per barrel mark, buoyed investment sentiment yesterday, with the 
ISEQ closing more than 100 points higher.
 The news that the Fed kept rates on hold for the second month running added to the positive trading. The falling oil 
prices again helped Ryanair, with the no-frills airline tacking on 21c to trade at 831. The airline also announced 
today that it is to add five new routes from Ireland in 2007, four from Dublin and one from Derry. Irish Life and 
Permanent led the way in the financial sector, jumping an impressive 42c to 1960. Other banking stocks also made 
marginal headway. Bank of Ireland was up 8c to 1548, while Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 1c to 1300, with AIB down 
1c to 2098. South Wharf continued its recent strong trading, climbing 19c to 6.95. Construction shares were mixed, 
with CRH down 3c to 26.97, Grafton unchanged on 1050 and Kingspan up 5c to 1575. McInerney made modest

Highlight: Irish shares hit an all time high today, with the ISEQ soaring 121 points as oil prices fell.
Body
Financial stocks led the Dublin market more than 120 points higher to an all time high today as oil prices hit six-
month lows.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 121.06 points higher on 8202.87.
Oil prices slid to the lowest point for six months today as traders were reassured by easing supply concerns ahead 
of the weekly report on energy stocks in the United States.
 The price of New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in October, slid as low as USD60.61 - the 
lowest point since March 21. In London, Brent North Sea crude for November delivery fell as low as 61.16 dollars, 
also last seen March 21. Crude prices had tumbled Tuesday on soft US economic data and as US President 
George W. Bush backed a 'diplomatic solution' to the nuclear crisis in major crude producer Iran. Crude oil has now 
shed around 22pc in value since striking historic highs above USD78 in July and August. The sharp falls boosted 
investor sentiment in Dublin with shares in Irish Continental Group and Ryanair rising more than 3pc. The Irish 
Ferries owner closed 33c higher on 1100, while no-frills airline Ryanair was up 28c to 810. Financial shares also 
shot up with the US Federal Reserve widely expected to leave interest rates on hold at its meeting late last night. 
Economists said that while the battle against inflation is not over, the trend points to an easing of inflationary 
pressures that will allow the central bank to maintain its base rate of 5.25pc. Last month, the Fed announced a 
pause after 17 consecutive rate increases, saying that any future actions would depend on incoming data. The 
latest statistics on inflation appeared to confirm the trend. US consumer prices rose 0.2pc in August and the widely 
watched core rate excluding food and energy increased at the same 0.2pc pace. Analysts say the sharp drop in 
energy costs in recent weeks will show up in future data, resulting in even tamer inflation figures. Shares in AIB 
welcomed the news, jumping 33c to 2063, while Anglo Irish Bank closed 26c higher on 1296, with Irish Life and 
Permanent up 23c to 1913. Bank of Ireland was also in the black, tacking on 16c to 1536, after it, earlier this week, 
raised its earnings forecast for the full-year. The bank surprised most analysts when it made the forecast, citing the 
ISEQ soars 121 pts to new all time high
bank's growing position in a surging economy and its stringent cost-cutting plans. In the construction sector, CRH 
managed modest gains, climbing 10c to 2700, while Grafton slipped 2c to 1050. Shares in McInerney were 
unchanged on 1300, with Kingspan down 2c to 1570. Other major gainers included insurance group FBD Holdings, 
up 20c to 3800, food group Kerry, up 13c to 1853, and drinks and snacks group C and C, up 11c to 1032. The 
strong investor sentiment stretched to other stocks. Qualceram Shires, which last week announced a significant 
drop in losses for the first six months of the year, climbed 9c to 154, while concrete maker Readymix tacked on 3c 
to 258. Shares in UTV shot up 28c to 538 after the media group confirmed that it was no longer interested in a 
merger with Scottish Media Group. Elsewhere, Paddy Power slipped 10c to 1436, while DCC dropped 13c to 1935, 
and South Wharf fell 19c to 676.

The badinage between Irish businessmen knows few bounds. Ryanair yesterday ran an advert in Irish newspapers 
promoting its latest new route - Dublin to Malta. It featured a picture of Denis O'Brien, the telecommunications 
entrepreneur who was reported last week to have moved his tax residency to the Mediterranean island ahead of the 
upcoming flotation of Digicel, his 83 per cent owned Caribbean mobile company.
The bubble caption read: "Just heard 'bout Ryanair's free seat sale! I'm moving to Malta!" The advert encouraged 
readers to book now for free flights. "All you pay is taxes," one thing O'Brien will apparently not be paying in Malta.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, is known to take a hands-on approach to designing the company's ad 
campaign, often using the medium to lampoon Irish ministers or the Brussels bureaucracy for thwarting his 
ambitions.
The swipe at O'Brien has his fingerprints all over it.

Body
Financial shares led the Dublin market comfortably higher today following a positive start on Wall Street and 
reassurances about the Eurozone economy from the European Central Bank.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 25.42 points higher on 8097.40. Trading was light with just 16 million shares 
changing hands.
The ECB said that it still sees growth in the eurozone despite prospects of further interest rate increases.
 ECB executive board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said "I don't see the risk," in response to questions 
whether further rate increases in the eurozone will dampen growth. At the end of last week, EU statistics office 
Eurostat released figures which showed that eurozone inflation eased slightly in August, limiting the scope for the 
ECB to continue raising interest rates. Economists said that while the decline will not stop the ECB council from 
hiking rates again over the next three months, it may mean that it does not need to continue tightening policy next 
year. Investors are also confident that the US Federal Reserve will leave rates unchanged when it meets later this 
week. The Fed passed up a chance to raise rates at its last meeting in August, breaking a string of 17 consecutive 
rate hikes. Indeed, Goodbody Stockbrokers have forecast that there will be no change for the rest of the year. 
Economist, Dermot O'Leary, said "since the last meeting on August 8, the Fed has received information that unit 
labour costs are growing at a much faster pace than originally thought. However, with the housing market 
continuing to weaken, the moderation in the monthly inflation increases will at least give the Fed more time to 
assess the incoming data before moving rates in either direction. We expect no change for the rest of the year." 
Financial shares have benefited most from the news. In Dublin today, Anglo Irish Bank was up 11c to 1271, while 
Bank of Ireland jumped 10c to 1500 and AIB tacked on 2c to 2007. Irish Life and Permanent was unchanged on 
1910. In the construction sector, shares were mixed. Building materials group CRH continued its recent strong 
trading, climbing 20c to 2750, while McInerney remained unchanged on 1300. However, Grafton and Kingspan both 
fell back, dropping 5c to 1035 and 27c to 1590 respectively. Shares in food group Kerry were the day's biggest

climbed 15c to 1600 and Irish Estates tacked on 20c to 365. Investors decided to pocket profits in Paddy Power 
after the bookmaker recorded solid gains last week. Shares in the bookmaker closed 14c lower in Dublin today on 
1445. Ryanair was also down slightly, shares in the no-frills airline slipped 3c to 785. Other notable movers included 
C and C, down 9c to 1038, DCC, which slipped 7c to 1038, and Viridian, up 25c to 1520.

 Empty-handed and wasting precious time AIRPORT SECURITY: August's 
terror alert left busy executives twiddling their thumbs at baggage 
collection. Jill James reviews the restrictions

It cannot have been a good couple of months for the makers of that sine qua non of the business traveller, 
executive hand luggage.
If holidaymakers have been seriously inconvenienced by the severe restrictions on aircraft luggage, wrought by the 
latest terror alert in London, then it has been even more troubling for the business traveller.
Following the UK government's reduction in security levels from critical to severe, passengers are still reminded by 
the British Airports Authority that strict security remains in place at all UK airports and that the easing of restrictions 
is not a return to normal.
Although there has been talk of easing the policy in the next few days, passengers still face hand baggage 
restrictions and are being asked to allow extra time for their journey and to arrive "prepared".
That means, in effect, that passengers must bring only one item of hand baggage that until last week had to be 
45cm x 35cm x 16cm, and be prepared to check in all other luggage. However, talks were taking place as Global 
Traveller went to press to allow small trolley bags as hand luggage.
All items carried by passengers will be screened and whether or not liquids, cosmetics, toiletries, gels or pastes are 
permitted, there will still be an ongoing debate about the secuirty risk that these items pose.
Once through security, if you are travelling to any destination except the US, you can take items purchased in the 
departure lounge into the aircraft.
Business travellers to the US have extra restrictions, however. Passengers face secondary security searches at the 
gate. No toiletries or cosmetics purchased in the departure lounge will be allowed into the aircraft cabin and any 
drinks or liquid items must be consumed before boarding. Food, however, is allowed. Passengers boarding flights 
to the US will be subjected to a secondary search at the gate and any liquids discovered will be removed.
Empty-handed and wasting precious time AIRPORT SECURITY: August's terror alert left busy executives 
twiddling their thumbs at baggage collection. Jill James rev....
The loss of the hand luggage facility posed a difficulty for business travellers, and its partial restoration probably 
causes more problems than its solves. It has certainly led to confusion among passengers concerning what items 
are, and are not, allowed on board.
Until the latest terror alert, some airlines had been actively encouraging travellers to take only hand luggage. 
Ryanair is one example. Michael O'Leary, its chief executive, is railing against the imposed restrictions to the extent 
of taking the matter to court.
Business travellers needing to check in luggage that they would rather carry on have been irritated that time that 
might be spent on work has been wasted in slow moving queues.
Leaving the airport quickly to fit in urgent meetings has been an impossibility for the last few weeks since business 
people have had to wait at the luggage belt along with everyone else.
Tom Barber, one of the founding directors of Original Travel, a short breaks company, is a regular business traveller 
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
He says: "The most unsettling thing about the baggage alert is that it has been changing daily. I hope it has settled 
down now. Our company deals in short breaks and the hand baggage requirements have been very restrictive.
"However, it does concentrate the mind having only a small bag - you can at least lead a clutter-free existence."

Construction and banking stocks dragged the Dublin market marginally higher this morning after figures released 
today showed that eurozone inflation fell slightly in August, limiting the scope for the ECB to continue raising 
interest rates.
Just before midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 23.61 to 8046.69
EU statistics office Eurostat confirmed its preliminary estimate that inflation eased to 2.3pc in August from 2.4pc in 
July and 2.5pc in June.
 Following the release, economists said that while the decline will not stop the ECB council from hiking rates again 
over the next three months, it may mean that it does not need to continue tightening policy next year. 'ECB council 
members have a dilemma on their hands as inflation is easing, just at the point when they are looking to escalate 
their tightening campaign,' said David Brown of Bear Stearns. He said the downward trend in inflation will not stop 
the ECB from raising its main interest rate to 3.50pc by end-year from 3.00pc currently, as expected by markets. 
The news boosted financial shares, with AIB jumping 5c to 1995, Anglo Irish Bank up 10 to 1255, while Bank of 
Ireland was unchanged on 1487. Meanwhile, investors pocketed gains from Irish Life and Permanent after its recent 
strong trading. Shres were down 3c to 1900. Construction stocks were also in the black. CRH was up 20c to 2740, 
while McInerney jumped 15c to 1295 and Kingspan tacked on 11c to 1251. Grafton bucked the trend, falling 12c to

Banking stocks led the Dublin market modestly higher today after figures showed that eurozone inflation eased 
slightly in August, limiting the scope for the ECB to continue raising interest rates.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 48.90 points higher on 8071.98.
EU statistics office Eurostat confirmed its preliminary estimate that inflation in the eurozone eased to 2.3pc in 
August from 2.4pc in July and 2.5pc in June.
 Following the release, economists said that while the decline will not stop the ECB council from hiking rates again 
over the next three months, it may mean that it does not need to continue tightening policy next year. 'ECB council

the ECB from raising its main interest rate to 3.50pc by end-year from 3.00pc currently, as expected by markets. 
Investors are also confident that the US Federal Reserve will leave rates unchanged when they meet next week. 
The Fed passed up a chance to raise rates at its last meeting in August, breaking a string of 17 consecutive rate 
hikes. Figures released today showed that core inflation over the past 12 months has risen by 2.8pc, the biggest 
12-month gain in nearly five years and far above the Fed's comfort zone of 1pc to 2pc price gains in core inflation. 
However, optimists point to big declines in world energy prices in recent weeks as evidence that inflation pressures 
are beginning to moderate. The news boosted financial shares in Dublin, with AIB jumping 15c to 2005, Anglo Irish 
Bank up 15 to 1260 and Bank of Ireland up 2c to 1489. Shares in Irish Life and Permanent bucked the trend, falling 
3c to 1900. Construction stocks were also in the black. CRH tacked on 10c to 2730, while McInerney jumped 20c to 
1300 and Kingspan tacked on 25c to 1585. Grafton bucked the trend however, falling 2c to 1040, as investors 
remain cautious about the building materials group. Despite posting a 35pc jump in pre-tax profits for the first six 
months of the year on Wednesday, the firms' share price took a tumble as investors decided it was time to pocket 
gains made in the year. Goodbody Stockbrokers said that the share price has already gained 14pc this year and is

expected to grow by 14pc for the year as a whole. Shares in Ryanair tacked on 18c to close on 784 despite the no-
frills airline announcing plans to suspend three routes from Ireland to France. Paddy Power also jumped sharply 
higher, tacking on 17c to 1452. Other notable movers included pharmaceutical firm Elan, up 9c to 1219, insurance 
group FBD Holdings fell 20c to 3780, while food group Kerry slipped 26c to 1841. Investors pocketed gains from 
drinks and snacks group CandC after a E200m expansion of its cider plant in Clonmel earlier this week. The news 
sent its share price sharply higher on Wednesday and Thursday. In Dublin today, shares slipped 16c to 1044.

Moroccan budget airline Jet4You will begin flights linking Casablanca with Paris and two Belgian cities in late 
October, taking on the Irish low-cost superstar Ryanair, which will start Europe-Morocco flights at the same time.
Jet4you's Paris-Casablanca flights will begin Oct. 29, with flights linking the Moroccan commercial capital to 
Charleroi and Liege, Belgium, set to start on Nov. 1, Jet4you's Casablanca office said Friday.
The fledgling airline, with just two planes at present, began flights between Paris and the Moroccan tourist centers 
of Fez, Marrakech and Agadir in February.
Morocco's entry this year into the European flight zone has opened the door to low-cost airlines looking to cash in 
on Morocco's growing popularity as a tourist destination for Europeans.
Ryanair, Europe's largest no-frills airline, announced its first foray into Africa last month, with flights to the Moroccan 
cities of Fez, Marrakech and Oujda from London's Luton Airport, Hahn Airport north of Frankfurt, Germany, and the 
southern French city of Marseille.

 Ryanair said that the plane which will be freed up for winter as a result of the withdrawals will be allocated to a

 Curbs on hand luggage may be relaxed AIRCRAFT SECURITY

Passengers will soon be allowed to carry larger bags on to aircraft again following a government announcement, 
expected next week, that it is relaxing some of the restrictions on hand luggage imposed after last month's security 
alert.
However, new European Union-wide measures on airline security are expected to mean a broader international ban 
on certain liquids being carried on board.
Ryanair, the budget airline, said last night that the relaxation of the rules on hand luggage could lead it to drop its 
legal claim for Pounds 3m compensation from the government.
The move to allow larger bags to be carried on board will be put to industry representatives at a meeting in London 
next week.
"We will be presenting new proposals aimed at lessening the burden on both passengers and operators while 
allowing us to maintain a rigorous security regime," said a Department for Transport official. "We will never 
compromise on passenger security but we are always mindful that passengers should be able to travel as freely as 
possible."
In Brussels, Jacques Barrot, European transport commissioner, said yesterday he would propose at a meeting of 
EU aviation specialists on September 27 that restrictions on carrying on liquids should be implemented throughout 
the EU, although he is not expected to call for a ban on all liquids in hand luggage.
The UK will meanwhile maintain its own ban on liquids, pending the outcome of the EU meeting. EU transport 
security officials plan over the coming days to reach agreement on the volume of liquids that can be taken on board 
without the risk of them being used as an explosive.
EU officials have suggested that a small bottle of shampoo or a toothpaste container would be acceptable volumes, 
while baby food and liquid medicines, allowed on flights out of the UK, would also be permitted.
 Curbs on hand luggage may be relaxed AIRCRAFT SECURITY
Mr Barrot is likely to call for laptop computers to be scanned separately when passengers put hand luggage through 
security checks, a measure which has been adopted by the UK authorities, the US and some other EU member 
states.
The proposals for relaxing the standards on hand luggage could be swiftly put into law because they do not require 
the backing of the European Parliament.
Even before there was an EU-wide agreement, passengers flying out of the UK would see a relaxation in days 
rather than weeks, said British officials.
While there is no longer specific intelligence, as there was in August, of an imminent terrorist threat to airlines flying 
out of the UK, British officials are continuing to warn that the threat of terrorism in the future remains "severe".
They have been advising the government against returning security at airports to the level that existed prior to the 
the foiling last month of an alleged plot to blow up aircraft with liquid explosives.

The financial impact ofthis summer's terror alerts became clearer yesterday with a profit warning from MyTravel, the 
package tour operator that owns Airtours and Going Places.
It followed news this week from BAA, which operates seven UK airports including Heathrow and Gatwick, that the 
security turmoil had cost it Pounds 13m in lost revenues and added costs.
The World Cup and a hot British summer have not helped matters but MyTravel blames August's terror alert, plus 
terror incidents in Turkey and Jordan, for "compounding an already difficult summer".
The group expects to make profit this year of Pounds 40m to Pounds 45m instead of the Pounds 75m to 85m that it 
had hoped for.
Peter McHugh, MyTravel's chief executive, says booking levels dropped for more than a week after the foiled airline 
plot in the second week in August and only with discounting did bookings rebound after several weeks.
The terror alerts have driven up costs for both airlines and airports, although most carriers report booking levels 
have largely recovered in subsequent weeks.
The August passenger numbers at BAA's seven UK airports were 5 per cent below forecast levels.
Numbers fell in August by 2.2 per cent year-on-year at Heathrow to 5.99m.
British Airways, which was forced to cancel 1,280 flights over several days affecting close to 100,000 passengers, 
said this month that the upheaval had cost it about Pounds 40m.
Overall bookings had returned to last year's levels but were still weaker than the much stronger trend of recent 
months.
Terrorism threat takes its toll on travel Roger Blitz and Kevin Done assess the effect that the terror alerts are 
having on the industry
EasyJet said that the security turmoil cost the airline about Pounds 4m and Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, has 
already launched a claim directly against the UK government for compensation for more than Pounds 3m damages.
A number of retailers have also complained of the impact of terror measures.
DSG International, which sells electrical goods through its Dixons airport stores, says sales are still "not quite where 
we expected them to be".
The retailer adds: "We are very happy with the advice from BAA but there is a bit of an issue with advice to 
passengers from airlines. Certain airlines are giving misleading advice that we think is having an impact on some 
retailers."
Particularly confusing is the often conflicting advice coming from the airport authorities and airlines concerning the 
use of devices such as laptops, iPods and cameras on board that have been purchased after customs. Boots, the 
health and beauty chain, also says business was hit in the days immediately following the terror alert, although it 
has been returning to normal recently.
Diageo, the drinks group that relies heavily on duty free sales, said last month that sales growth had been had been 
hit by the new airport security measures.
"This is a very uncertain world," Paul Walsh, chief executive, said on the day, referring also to the impact of war in 
Lebanon. "You can't keep absorbing these hits."
However, observers of the package tour operators believe excuses about terror alerts mask more fundamental 
shifts in the industry.
Tour operators and their allied charter airlines have for several years been suffering a heavy loss of market share to 
the scheduled low- cost carriers, whose low fares and internet booking engines have transformed the way many 
people arrange their travel and holidays, with air travel and hotels being booked as separate items.
European charter traffic has been in long-term decline with many charter airlines choosing to sell a growing share of 
their capacity through "seat-only" bookings.
BAA said European charter traffic at its seven UK airports fell again by 6.8 per cent year-on-year in August, chiefly 
due to continuing competition from low-cost services.
MyTravel, which has undergone a long and painstaking restructuring and cost-cutting programme after flirting with 
bankruptcy in 2002, has been hampered more than most by the scale and speed at which British consumers have 
changed travel habits.
Mark Reed, analyst with Teather & Greenwood, says in a note: "The scale of the cut (in consensus forecast profit), 
49 per cent, highlights the necessity for the group to broaden its product range and diversify from the budget short-
haul market."
Others in the sector are also suffering the pain.
"It's a very difficult market, margin and volumesare under pressure," says Manny Fontenla-Novoa, chief executive 
of Thomas Cook Europe. "We still intend to hit our budgets but we have to work very hard to achieve that."
Package tour operators have set up their own online services to wrest back business lost to the likes of Expedia 
and Lastminute.com.
Others, such as First Choice, have changed the business model, offering more medium and long-haul flights in 
more upmarket packages and reducing its short-haul mainstream offering to about 25 per cent of the business.
Terrorism threat takes its toll on travel Roger Blitz and Kevin Done assess the effect that the terror alerts are 
having on the industry
Thomas Cook has offered unbundled services so that customers can put together their own tailored holidays but 
still allowing the company to retain commission.
Yet, however smart tour operators get, the nature of their high-volume, low-margin business means they will always 
be at the mercy of events such as terrorism.
One leisure analyst says the package holiday is less of a must-have than it used to be and had become slightly old-
fashioned.
The analyst says: "It won't mean package tour operators become extinct but they have to change the model and 
product and show they have value."

 (ANSA) - Trapani, September 14 - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair launched today a flight connecting the airport of 
Trapani, on the Sicily island, the southernmost part of Italy, and Pisa, northern Italy.
The flight will be operated by a Boeing 737 aircraft, which had 180 passengers on board during its first flight to Pisa. 
A total 100,000 passengers are expected to travel on the route in the first year after the launch of the flight.
 The new service was presented officially at a new conference by Alessia Viviani from Ryanair, Fabrizio Bignardelli, 
deputy chairman of airport operator Airgest, and provincial councillor Giuseppe Poma.
 From Pisa passengers will have the opportunity to fly, again with Ryanair, to 17 international destinations. Ryanair 
boasts 35 million passengers a year, 309 destinations and 101 aircraft. The company's fleet is expected to rise to 
230 by 2012, Alessia Viviani of Ryanair said on March 28, 2006 as reported by ANSA.

Airport security upheaval costs BAA Pounds 13m

The security turmoil at British airports last month cost BAA, the UK airports operator, Pounds 13m.
The group, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial, said yesterday that passenger numbers at its seven UK airports in 
August were 5 per cent below forecast.
BAA was delisted from the London Stock Exchange in mid-August following its takeover by a consortium led by 
Ferrovial, the Spanish construction, infrastructure and services group, in a deal that valued the BAA equity at 
Pounds 10bn.
The disruption, most marked at BAA's three London airports - Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick - was caused by the 
imposition of tough security measures by the government on August 10 in response to an alleged plot to blow up 
several passenger jets across the north Atlantic.
British Airways, the biggest operator at London Heathrow, accounting for more than 40 per cent of all take-offs and 
landings, said earlier this month that the upheaval had cost it around Pounds 40m. It said its booking levels were 
still weaker than in recent months.
BA was forced to cancel 1,280 flights affecting close to 100,000 passengers, and the airline is still keeping its 
options open on whether to seek compensation and to take legal action against BAA.
Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, has launched a claim directly against the government for compensation of more 
than Pounds 3m damages. It says it suffered from the tighter security measures, which led to the cancellation of 
more than 260 of its flights.
The security problems at Heathrow have triggered a bitter row between BA and BAA. Willie Walsh, BA's chief 
executive, has blamed the airports operator rather than the government for the turmoil and said recently: "If BAA 
had responded faster, a lot of disruption could have been avoided."
BA has called for the break-up of the BAA London airports monopoly and the separation of the ownership of 
Heathrow and Stansted airports.
Airport security upheaval costs BAA Pounds 13m
The rules in the UK are now more restrictive than at any other airports in Europe, and limit passengers both leaving 
the UK and transferring through the UK to a cabin bag the size of a small laptop bag. BA claims that it is losing 
transfer passengers at Heathrow to airlines using rival hubs such as Paris Charles de Gaulle or Amsterdam 
Schiphol.
BAA said it had been forced to cancel more than 2,000 flights in order to cope with the extra security burden and to 
restore order to flight operations. Airlines had chosen to cancel about 500 additional loss-making flights, chiefly UK 
domestic services, to save money.
Overall passenger traffic at the group's UK airports rose by 0.3 per cent in August to 14.3m. Numbers fell by 2.2 per 
cent year-on-year at Heathrow in August to 5.99m, but rose by 4.9 per cent at Stansted and by 2.1 per cent at 
Gatwick.
BAA said that UK domestic flights had been worst hit by the disruption with a fall in passenger numbers of 7.6 per 
cent. European charter traffic fell by 6.8 per cent, although that was chiefly due to the continuing competition from 
low-cost services.

At first glance, the price set by Aer Lingus for its initial public offering looks pretty cautious.
A range of Euros 2.10-Euros 2.70 a share seems designed to get the Irish airline's offer away, while a minimum 
application of Euros 10,000 will deter smaller retail investors, badly burnt in the past by the privatisation of Eircom. 
Assuming the greenshoe is unused, the state will retain a third of the carrier and employees will keep just over 10 
per cent. At Euros 2.40, the mid-price implies a multiple of 9.5 times last year's earnings. This compares with a 
long-term average, according to Davy Stockbrokers, of 13.1 times for the European network airlines. Assuming an 
end 2006 net cash position of Euros 165m, adjusted for IPO proceeds,
Aer Lingus's implied enterprise value of Euros 1bn is 5.8 times this year's consensus earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, amortisation
and aircraft rentals. This is appropriately nearer to British Airways' multiple of 4 times than Ryanair's 11.
So on straightforward valuation metrics, the price range chosen seems sensible. Yet some caution seems justified. 
Aer Lingus has espoused a hybrid but convincing business model that combines low fares with certain frills. It has 
also pursued a demanding cost-cutting programme. Still, performance is hardly stellar. In the first half of 2006, 
underlying operating profit and ebitdar were flat year-on-year.
Deciding to buy the shares will depend less on historic performance than on willingness to support the 
management's ambitions to expand its fleet and add long-haul destinations. At the mid-price, the offer will raise 
Euros 470m of cash for Aer Lingus. After a Euros 104m payment to its pension fund, it will be left with about Euros 
350m, even before taking on any new debt, to help fund those ambitions. Cautious is not an obvious word to apply 
to this strategy.

State-owned Aer Lingus airline expects to net $597.8 million from Sept. 27 IPO

Body
Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus Group PLC, announced Tuesday it plans to net 470.3 million euros 
($597.75 million) from its Sept. 27 initial public offering, a sale going ahead despite concerns that other recent 
airline offerings have fared poorly in a market worried about terrorism and fuel costs.
The Dublin-based airline which nearly went bankrupt in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes in the United States 
but returned strongly to profit in recent years said the sale would be used primarily to buy both short- and long-haul 
aircraft as part of an aggressive, six-year expansion plan.
It said the government would retain a minimum 25.1 percent share in the company as expected, but would sell 72.7 
million shares, while an additional 208.4 million shares would be created. The share price was set in a range of 2.10 
euros to 2.70 euros ($2.67 to $3.43), with the exact price to be confirmed Sept. 27 when the shares go on sale.
Aer Lingus was expected to begin trading Oct. 2 on the stock exchanges in Dublin and London, the company said.
The share-price range will value the post-IPO company at 1.10 billion euros to 1.27 billion euros ($1.40 billion to 
$1.62 billion).
"We have made a good start to 2006 and we are well positioned for the future. We believe the capital-raising we are 
undertaking will allow the group to make the most of our opportunities and create value for shareholders," Chief 
Executive Dermot Mannion said in a statement.
Mannion and other Aer Lingus executives spent Tuesday in London making boardroom presentations to potential 
institutional investors.
The flotation will be open to institutions in the United States and Europe and to private investors in Britain and 
Ireland willing to invest a minimum of 10,000 euros ($12,700).
State-owned Aer Lingus airline expects to net $597.8 million from Sept. 27 IPO
Analysts noted that other recent flotations of airlines over the past year involving German budget airline Air Berlin 
PLC, Slovakia's SkyEurope Holding AG and Air China Ltd. have fared poorly because of the sector's struggle to 
remain competitive in the face of increased fuel and security costs.
But Aer Lingus executives note that their airline is among Europe's few aviation success stories, thanks to its 
radical program of cutting staff, slashing fares and refocusing services since 2002 on European no-frills routes.
They argue that the company must hold an IPO to drum up enough capital to buy new aircraft, particularly long-haul 
Airbuses or Boeings that would permit new routes to the United States, South Africa, Middle East and Asia.
Aer Lingus currently links Ireland directly with the U.S. cities Boston, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles and 
Dubai in the Persian Gulf, but otherwise competes with no-frills leader Ryanair Holdings PLC on European short-
haul routes.

Financial shares dragged the Dublin market sharply lower today in light trading as investors continued to pocket 
profits.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 42.95 points lower on 7923.63, with just nineteen million shares changing 
hands.
The ISEQ fell by more than 100 points last week as investors pocketed profits following two weeks of sharp gains 
and a series of positive trading updates and interim results from leading Irish firms.
 Last week was a busy one for corporate results, with nine companies reporting interim results and CPL releasing 
full-year results for the 12 months to the end of June. Davy Stockbrokers said that the results underpinned "the very 
strong upward momentum that there is in corporate earnings in the Irish market". "In aggregate, the results were 
11pc higher than the same period in 2005. The star performer was CPL, with full-year results that were almost 15pc 
ahead of forecasts and more than 80pc higher than the previous year," Davy analyst Robbie Kelleher said. "Irish 
Life and Permanent and Kingspan also produced very strong numbers, while earnings at ICG were over 60pc 
higher." Davy said that it was upgrading numbers for Irish Life and Permanent, Kingspan, FBD, CPL and Anglo Irish 
Bank. "We now expect earnings for the market (ex-Elan) to grow by 19pc in 2006, up from our forecast of 13pc at 
the start of 2006," Mr Kelleher said. Investor sentiment in Dublin was also hit by sombre start on Wall Street with 
investors sidelined as the US commemorated the fifth anniversary of the September 11 World Trade Centre 
attacks. Shares were also down on major bourses across Europe. In Dublin, the financials endured a torrid time, 
with AIB the biggest faller, down 38c to 1962. Bank of Ireland was also down, slipping 10c to 1445, while Anglo Irish 
Bank fell back 4c to 1248. Irish Life and Permanent was another faller, down 23c to 1877. The wider market 
suffered as a result of the general sluggish performance of the banks. Construction stocks were mixed, with 
Kingspan up 5c to 1525, McInerney up 10c to 1195 and Grafton down 1c on 1074. Shares in building materials 
group CRH were unchanged on 2655. Shares in food and drinks group C and C were down 9c to 1040, while 
Banks lead Dublin market 42 points lower
insurance group DCC slipped 36c to 1924 and no-frills airline Ryanair closed 3c lower on 770. Shares in CPL were 
up 2c to 502, while FBD Holdings recovered from a slow start to close 25c higher on 3825. Elsewhere, bookmaker 
Paddy Power was unchanged on 1410 after it announced a strong first half performance last week. Shares in UTV 
were unchanged on 495 after the broadcaster this morning posted a 30pc rise in operating profits. Shares in 
bathroom suites distributor, Qualceram Shires, climbed more than 9pc, or 12c, to 140 after it agreed to buy the 
freehold relating to part of its facility at South Quay in Arklow from the Arklow Harbour Commissioners for an

Financial stocks led the Dublin market lower today as the general nervousness that has returned to haunt the 
Dublin market in September continued.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 51.44 points lower on 7966.58, having been down by as much as 75 points 
earlier in the session. The losses meant the market was down over 120 points for the week.
Losses were capped by a positive start on Wall Street after oil prices fell and investors seemed to shrug off another 
warning from a homebuilder about declining demand.
 After closing out August in impressive style, climbing above the 8000 level for the first time since May, Irish stocks 
have began September in sluggish fashion. Investor sentiment was hit by negative world markets amid inflation 
worries which investors fear could prompt the US Federal Reserve to again lift interest rates. The financials bore 
the brunt of the falls today, with AIB hit worst, down 20c to 2010. Bank of Ireland fared little better, closing 9c lower 
on 1456, while Anglo Irish Bank slipped 10c to 1245 and Irish Life and Permanent dropped 18c to 1902. The story 
was similar in the construction sector, where CRH continued to be hit profit taking after recording sharp gains in 
recent weeks. Shares in the building materials group were down 26c to 2654 in Dublin today. Kingspan and 
McInerney were both also in the red, slipping 5c to 1520 and 15c to 1185 respectively, while Grafton closed 10c 
lower on 1075. Meanwhile, FBD Holdings was the biggest faller of the day, down 49c to 3800, after it this week 
posted an almost 50pc increase in its pre-tax profits for the first six months of the year to E157.4m. The group also 
predicted strong trading in the rest of the year. 'All of our businesses continue to perform satisfactorily and we are 
confident regarding the outcome for the full year. We continue to focus on maximising returns to shareholders,' said 
FBD's CEO Philip Fitzsimons. Kerry Group was hit by profit taking after it announced a pre-tax profit of E216m for

Security turmoil fails to depress EasyJet
 Security turmoil fails to depress EasyJet

EasyJet confirmed it would leave its profit guidance for the year unchanged, despite the security turmoil at UK 
airports last month that cost the UK low-cost carrier about Pounds 4m.
The airline was forced to cancel 469 flights over a period of five days butmanaged to accommodate the majority of 
affectedcustomers on alternative flights.
The disruption resulted in additional costs for passenger assistance and compensation and hit revenues during the 
period of the security scare and in the immediate aftermath.
British Airways said this week that the upheaval had cost it about Pounds 40m and warned that its booking levels 
were still weaker than in recent months.
The disruption was caused by the sudden imposition of much tougher security measures by the UK government on 
August 10 at all UK airports in response to an alleged plot to blow up several passenger jets across the North 
Atlantic.
The main problems were caused at the London airports, where EasyJet has its three biggest bases at Gatwick, 
Luton and Stansted airports.
Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, has already launched a claim directly against the UK government for 
compensation for more than Pounds 3m damages it says it suffered from the tighter security measures, which led to 
the cancellation of more than 260 of its flights, chiefly to and from Stansted airport, its biggest European base.
EasyJet said that, in spite of the extra costs, it was maintaining its current guidance for growth in pre-tax profit for 
the financial year to the end of September of 40 to 50 per cent to between Pounds 115m and Pounds 124m, up 
from Pounds 82.6m last year.
The airline said that its passenger numbers in August had risen by 8.4 per cent to 3.1m. It handled 32.7m 
passengers in the latest 12 months, a 12.1 per cent rise from 29.2m a year earlier.
Security turmoil fails to depress EasyJet
Ryanair, the leading European low-cost carrier, which is expanding its capacity faster than EasyJet, carried 4m 
passengers in August, 23 per cent more than a year ago, with 38.4m carried in the latest 12 months.
Both carriers are expanding their networks into new countries including Turkey, Croatia and Morocco.

Shares on the Dublin market took a tumble this morning as investors continued to pocket profits after sharp gains 
during recent weeks.
At 1300, the ISEQ was down 66.69 points to 8019.62.
Sentiment was also hit after Irish Continental and Fyffes became the latest companies to announce disappointing 
interim results.
 CRH was the biggest faller in the construction sector as investors continued to plunder profits after shares in the 
building materials group soared last week. Shares were down 32 to 2713 today. Other construction stocks were 
also down, with Grafton slipping 12c to 1085, Kingspan down 5c to 1535 and McInerney 5c lower on 1200. 
Financials stocks were mixed. Irish Life and Permanent was a big faller, down 34c to 19.21, while AIB slipped 14c

Ryanair's revolution against high fare tyranny came close to causing public mutiny in Spain this week. The low-cost 
carrier offered a free flight to anyone who gathered in Barcelona's Plaza Catalunya with a placard saying why they 
preferred Ryanair to Iberia, the Spanish flagship airline. Such was the response - Ryanair estimates about 500 
people gathered - that the airline was unable to hand out the promised tickets.
Spanish press reports say a Ryanair representative was mobbed while trying to distribute free flights and then 
rescued by police when she was cornered by angry placard-bearers. Ryanair denies there was any kind of scuffle, 
but made it up to the loyal public by giving away a flight to the first 1,500 people to apply by e-mail.
The Spanish airlines association failed to see the funny side, condemning the publicity stunt as "shameful". Ryanair 
seemed to be taking it in its stride yesterday, jesting that its wider free-seat offer was sparking riots throughout 
Europe and calling on punters to "join the revolution". It is not as if the company isn't accustomed to such hiccups: 
Germans turning out for a free seat rally mis-translated the rubric and arrived with frying pans instead of placards.

The Dublin market ended a sluggish day in negative territory for the second consecutive day today following 
another mixed set of half year trading updates.
The ISEQ index closed marginally lower, down 32.47 points to 8086.31. Volume remained light with just 18 million 
shares changing hands.
After spending much of the day in the black, shares slipped back in late afternoon trading as Wall Street opened 
lower on wage inflation concerns.
 The Labour Department said today that productivity decreased and wages increased in the spring, stoking fears 
that wage inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to return to a policy of interest rate hikes. Major US indices, 
which had reached three-month highs, pulled back on the news. In Dublin, shares were also hit as investors 
pocketed profits from the likes of CRH, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life and Permanent, who have all recently 
delivered strong buoyant trading updates. Irish Life and Permanent was the biggest faller, down 40c to 1955, after 
Ireland's largest house mortgage lender and life assurance group posted a 23pc increase in operating profit for the 
six months to June 30. The story was similar for Anglo Irish Bank, whose shares fell 9c to 1260, after it upgraded its 
full year forecasts on Tuesday. It predicted that earnings per share will be ahead of the current market consensus of 
87 cents by more than 3 cents. The group is due to release its full year results on December 6. Elsewhere in the 
financial sector, Bank of Ireland was down 10c to 1460, while AIB slipped 20c to 2050. CRH was also in the red as 
investors continued to pocket profits following sharp gains last week. Shares in the building materials group closed 
28c lower on 2745 in Dublin today. Other construction shares were more fortunate, with Grafton up 2c to 1097 and 
McInerney, up 15c to 1205. Kingspan was trading positively again, up 5cto 1540 after it reported a 33.7pc rise in 
profits in the first half of the year on Tuesday. In a week when no less than nine Dublin-listed companies are 
releasing trading updates, today it was the turn of Paddy Power, Glanbia and FBD to release their interim results. 
Shares in Paddy Power fell slightly, down 5c to 1425, despite the bookmaker announcing a 12pc rise in pre-tax

London security turmoil cost BA Pounds 40m

Body
The security turmoil at London airports last month cost British Airways about Pounds 40m, and the airline warned 
yesterday that its booking levels were still weaker than in recent months.
The sudden imposition of much tougher security measures be-cause of an alleged plot to blow up several 
transatlantic passenger jets forced BA to cancel 1,280 flights over several days, affecting close to 100,000 
passengers.
The airline, the biggest operator at London's Heathrow airport, said the financial impact included lost revenue and 
the increased costs of hotel accommodation, catering and transporting misplaced baggage.
BA said the traffic of passengers transferring through Heathrow still had not recovered because of continuing 
limitations on the size of carry-on baggage allowed at UK airports. The regulations in the UK are more restrictive 
than at any other airport in Europe, and limit passengers leaving and transferring through the UK to a cabin bag the 
size of a small laptop case.
The problem is chiefly being felt at Heathrow, BA's global hub, where transfer passengers usually account for 30-35 
per cent of its passengers.
Overall bookings had returned to last year's levels but were still weaker than the much stronger trend of recent 
months.
European aviation security officials are due to meet in Brussels today to discuss the threat of liquid explosives on 
aircraft and the level of security measures.
The problems at Heathrow triggered a bitter row be-tween BA and BAA, the airport's operator. George Stinnes, BA 
head of investor relations, said yesterday the airline was still keeping its options open on whether to take legal 
action against BAA or to seek compensation
Shares in BA fell by 5.1 per cent or 19 3/4p on the day the security measures were imposed, but have since 
recovered strongly and yesterday closed 4 1/2p or 1.1 per cent higher at 418 3/4p.

British Airways PLC said Tuesday that the terrorism scare last month that grounded thousands of its flights cost the 
airline 40 million pounds (US$76 million; â¬59.13 million).
The carrier said the extra expense came from lost revenues it canceled around 1,280 flights during the height of the 
alert and the cost of hotels, catering and baggage repatriation for passengers whose flights were canceled.
The airline added that there has been some impact on forward bookings since the disruption, largely because of 
ongoing heightened security measures at Britain's airports.
However, overall passenger numbers were still up in August compared with last year, rising 1.5 percent to 3.15 
million.
"The overall level of bookings has returned to levels experienced last year, but is still weaker than the trend of the 
past few months," BA said in a statement. "The recovery of premium and non-premium transfer traffic, for example, 
is lagging due to the limitations on carryon baggage at London."
BA is the first airline to reveal a cost estimate for the alert that crippled the country's airports last month.
In comparison, a week before the alert the carrier announced a first-quarter net profit of 150 million pounds 
(US$282 million; â¬221 million) on revenue of 2.32 billion pounds (US$4.36 billion; â¬3.41 billion).
The trans-Atlantic route was the target of an alleged plot to blow up as many as 10 aircraft with liquid explosives 
that was revealed by the government on Aug. 10, sparking tough new security regulations that banned all hand 
luggage and increased passenger searches.
Travelers were restricted to one clear plastic bag as carry on luggage, holding little more than their passport and 
tickets. No food or drink was allowed on board and mothers were forced to taste bottles of baby milk to show it was 
safe.
British Airways says it lost 40 million pounds during airport terrorism alert
Those measures have since been eased, but restrictions still apply on hand luggage all liquids, including toiletries, 
remain banned.
BA is among several airlines that blamed BAA PLC for the chaos that followed the alert, claiming the airports 
authority was ill-prepared for the emergency. BAA has defended its actions.
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, meanwhile, has blamed the government for its own loss of revenue and has 
launched legal action in the High Court, claiming 3 million pounds (US$5.7 million; â¬4.4 million) compensation.
Looking ahead, BA said "visibility" about trading was limited as it emerged from the issues surrounding August's 
alert, but added that market conditions continue to be good.
Shares in the company closed 1.1 percent higher at 418.75 pence (US$7.93; â¬6.17).

Boeing's decision to shut down its loss-making Connexion division has not discouraged rival in-flight connectivity 
providers from pushing ahead with plans to offer what they insist will be more affordable passenger communication 
services.
Underlining this, Australian carrier Qantas has agreed to a three-month evaluation of AeroMobile's service from 
early 2007 on board Boeing 767s operating domestic routes. And Irish budget carrier Ryanair is to equip its entire 
Boeing 737 fleet with OnAir's on-board mobile phone system.
But the setback suffered by the world's largest aerospace company, which will result in it taking a pre-tax charge of 
up to $320 million, has sounded yet another warning to an industry accustomed to seeing in-flight entertainment 
(IFE) services fall short of expectations.
Airlines want a supplier to have a "business case that makes sense and have a proposal that is sustainable", says 
Peter Tuggey, director of sales and airline programmes for AeroMobile, the in-flight connectivity partnership 
between Arinc and Telenor. If an in-flight product fails, he says, "that creates real concern and there is a backlash" 
from passengers who have become accustomed to using the service.
Initially, AeroMobile is using Inmarsat's "classic" narrowband satellite communications as a "stepping stone" to 
support its in-flight voice and short messaging service using passengers' own GSM mobile phones. This ensures 
AeroMobile is "cost effective and very light", says Tuggey, but it also provides "an economic vision" that gives 
airlines "tangible levels of connectivity on the satcom systems they have today, yet the same architecture will also 
support broadband" in the future.
The company is on target to begin revenue service this year, with two airlines to launch its voice and messaging 
services in the next six months, says Tuggey.
New connections
OnAir, a joint venture between Airbus, Sita and Tenzing that will use Inmarsat's SwiftBroadband satcom, has also 
taken a different approach to Connexion "from the very basics of the technology used, to the most fundamental 
element: the needs and preferences of the target market", says chief executive George Cooper.
The company's model "recognises passengers' differing requirements, ranging from using their mobile or 
BlackBerry-type devices, to accessing webchat and webmail through the in-seat in-flight entertainment system, to 
full Wi-Fi internet and VPN access through their laptops", Cooper says.
Air France will carry out a six-month single-aircraft trial of OnAir's GSM phone connectivity service next year - the 
third carrier after BMI and TAP Portugal to sign up for a trial and the first to take an aircraft line-fitted with the 
system.
Connexion by Boeing's approach was to provide high-speed connectivity to a passenger's laptop, via leased Ku-
band satellites. Lack of demand was the reason cited for halting Connexion sales in June and the company's 
subsequent announcement it will shut down the business unit and work with customers "to facilitate an orderly 
phase out" of the service. But the cost of making aircraft compatible with the service was a major deterrent to many 
potential customers.
US Airways vice-president of sales, marketing and distribution Travis Christ, has said that, after considering weight 
and wiring issues, Connexion proved "more than we could afford".
Those Asian and European operators that did adopt Connexion have expressed disappointment at Boeing's 
decision. Lufthansa says it hopes a solution can be found to continue the service. But South Korean carrier Asiana, 
which has service on two of its 777s, says it is in negotiations with Boeing and may receive compensation. Boeing 
declines to comment on reports that Korean Air, which has Connexion on 29 747-400s and 777s, intends to ask the 
company to reimburse at least $12 million.
Boeing expects to record a pre-tax charge of up to $320 million, of which about $290 million is expected to be 
recognised in the third quarter and $30 million in the fourth quarter. This includes write-downs of assets of $472 
million, contract termination costs of $168 million (including operating leases, supplier and customer costs), offset 
by a gain of $320 million associated primarily with early termination of capital lease obligations.
The shutting down of Connexion, therefore, will be one of the more expensive missteps in an in-flight 
communications market that seen its share of reversals. But the lure of connecting passengers wherever they fly is 
still bringing companies into the market. In the USA, AirCell is developing air-to-ground wireless services that the 
company says "will be a fraction of the cost of satellite-based broadband systems".
The Colorado-based company in June won an exclusive broadband licence at a US government auction. Targeted 
for launch in 2007, AirCell's ground-based network will initially cover the continental USA, but is expandable to 
Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.
Like AeroMobile and OnAir, AirCell's system will support the use of cellular telephones on board aircraft. But further 
regulatory approvals are required before this can be offered in the USA. And the social issues surrounding 
passenger cellphone use have yet to be resolved. The business case for in-flight connectivity, it seems, has still to 
be proved.

Body
Shares on the Dublin market picked up today where they spent all of last week, trading in the black for the eighth 
consecutive day following several strong trading updates in recent weeks.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 40.29 points higher on 8132.36.
Trading remained light with just 19 million shares changing hands in Dublin.
 Last week saw shares break through the 8000 level for the first time since May following a string of strong results 
and buoyant trading updates from several leading firms including CRH, AIB and C and C. Trading is expected to 
remain strong in coming days with several Irish firms set to announce results for the first half of the year. Paddy 
Power and Irish Life and Permanent are due to release their results tomorrow. Shares across Europe traded higher 
today, however, trading remained light with US markets closed for the Labour Day holiday. Falling oil prices also 
added to investor sentiment with the cost of a barrel in London falling below USD68 for the first time since June 21. 
Traders took the view that possible sanctions against Iran will not be adopted any time soon and were encouraged 
as fears over US hurricanes receded. After gaining almost 11pc on Friday, shares in C and C remained buoyant 
again after the drinks firm posted better-than-expected trading update at the end of last week. The group said that 
turnover growth in the first half of the year is expected to rise by more than 25pc. This led both Credit Suisse and 
Deutsche Bank to up their targets for the firm, to E12.6 from E10.30 and to E12 from E10 respectively. Deutsche 
Bank said that with forecasts suggesting a 2pc share of the UK beer market for the company by the end of the year, 
there is considerable upside for future growth and share price appreciation. Shares in the firm have now more than 
tripled in price since its flotation in mid-2004. In trading today, they were up 2pc or 23c to 998. Shares in CRH were 
the day's biggest gainer, climbing 50c to 2790, after it confirmed the purchase of RSI Roofing, a Hawaii-based roof 
specialist firm for an undisclosed sum. RSI is the second Hawaii company for the Dublin-based construction and 
building supplies giant. Elsewhere in the construction sector, Grafton jumped 10c to 110, while Kingspan tacked on 
4c to 1418. McInerney remained unchanged on 1190. Financial stocks were mostly lower, however AIB managed to 
CRH & C&C lead ISEQ 40 points higher
buck the trend, adding 22c to close on 2050. Elsewhere, Bank of Ireland slipped 3c to 1480, Anglo-Irish Bank fell 9c 
to 1310 and Irish Life and Permanent closed 20c lower on 2010. Shares in Ryanair were up 9c to 769 after the no 
frills airline posted record passenger numbers for August and announced three new routes from Dublin. Meanwhile, 
bookmaker Paddy Power was up 5c to 1427 as investors awaited its interim results for the first six months. The 
firm's results are expected to come in ahead of expectations, in-line with several large bookmakers in the UK who 
have posted strong results in recent weeks. Shares in the Fyffes property offshoot, Blackrock International, were 
unchanged on 040 after it announced plans to invest E200m over the next two years. Elsewhere, Newcourt was in 
the black, jumping 3c to 125, after the outsourcing group named Ely CEO Philip Marley as an executive director.

Continental reveals costs of air alert AVIATION

Body
Continental Airlines has revealed that last month's security alert cost the carrier millions of dollars in lost revenue, in 
the first admission by a non-UK carrierthat heightened security concerns are having a lasting financial impact.
Houston-based Continental was one of three US airlines - alongside American and United - identified by US 
security officials as the target of an alleged plot to bomb transatlantic aircraft following a UK-led intelligence 
operation on August 10.
The alert led to sweeping new security measures at airports, and the ensuing disruption forced British Airways, 
Ryanair and other UK-based carriers to cancel hundreds of flights.
Non-UK carriers maintained there had been minimal impact on passenger bookings after the initial disruption, but 
Continental's latest monthly traffic report has suggested the carrier was forced to cut fares in order tosupport higher 
traffic levels.
Continental is one of the largest operators of trans-atlantic services, and continued to add flights over the summer 
alongside rivals such as Delta, leading analysts to forecast downward pressure on fares.
Continental said late on Friday that its margins in August had been hit by what it described as the "elevated security 
concerns", reducing its closely watched revenue per available seat mile by1.5 percentage points from the expected 
level.
The airline said RASM rose between 6.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent during the month, below analysts' estimates, in 
spite of record traffic and load factors on other routes, and trailing the9.6 per cent rise in July.
Continental's mainline RASM - which excludes regional feeder services - rose 5.5-6.5 per cent in August, and traffic 
was 12 per cent higher in terms of revenue passenger miles.
Continental reveals costs of air alert AVIATION
Merrill Lynch had forecast an increase of 7-8 per cent, and while this was in line with the performance excluding 
"security concerns", the carrier had consistently beaten estimates in recent months.
Continental is one of the few US carriers to release monthly revenue statistics broken down by region.
Its report will raise concerns about the sustainability of the industry's financial recovery, as airlines enter the slower 
travel season following the Labour Day holiday.
All the major US carriers reported higher operating profits during the second quarteras a series of fare increasesand 
continued cost-cuttinghelped to counter higher fuel prices.
The higher fares have been helped by capacity cuts over the past two years, but year-on-year comparisons will 
become tougher for airlines to match after August, noted Merrill Lynch.

Body
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has slammed plans to build a new metro service to Dublin Airport, 
describing it as "a waste of time and money".
Speaking at the launch of its passenger figures for August today, Mr O'Leary said that the money earmarked for the 
Metro plan would be better spent elsewhere.
He said that with just 20pc of passengers using Dublin Airport forecast to use such a service, the Government 
should consider investing the money on a new road around Dublin.
 Mr O'Leary also used the opportunity to take another swipe at the handling of airport security following the recent 
terrorist alerts in the UK. He questioned why UK officials had not tightened up security on rail travel and the London 
Underground, despite the majority of terrorist activity in Europe in recent years being aimed towards rail travel. The 
no frills airline re-iterated that its recently announced court action against the UK government was aimed at getting 
airport services back to normal and not about money. Ryanair announced last week that any money won from the 
court action would be given to charity.

Highlight: Millions Ryanair of passengers are facing extra 'stealth' charges in the form of baggage check-in fees.
Body
While budget airline, Ryanair, has so far lived up to its promise not to slap a surcharges on tickets, millions of 
passengers are facing extra 'stealth' charges in the form of baggage check-in fees and reduced weight allowances.
'Watch my lips,' said Ryanair's colourful chief executive, Michael O'Leary earlier this year. 'No surcharges on 
Ryanair tickets'.
His promise came as aviation fuel costs soared to record highs in line with world crude oil prices and major airlines, 
including British Airways, slapped fuel surcharges onto tickets.
 However, the airline is attempting to claw back some of the spiralling costs of fuel through other means, chiefly by 
charging more for bags. An airline analyst has predicted that Ryanair could reap up to E50 million a year from 
baggage charges and restrictions to offset its massive fuel bill.

The City came back from holiday this week to news of a new chairman at Barclays. Meanwhile, the support 
services sector has, once again, produced several companies plagued by accounting irregularities. Ryanair's flights 
are set to get much noisier after this week's announcement that mobile phones will soon be allowed on board.
LEISURE
Harrah's Entertainment the world's biggest gaming company, this week made its first foray into the newly 
deregulated UK market, agreeing to buy London Clubs International for Pounds 279.3m. The move could herald a 
"land grab" by US gaming groups attracted by the UK government's go-ahead forbigger casinos, largerjackpots and 
liberalised licensing hours.
BANKS
Marcus Agius was last night confirmed as the new chairman of Barclays after Matt Barrett said he would retire from 
the UK's third-largest bank at the end of the year. Mr Agius isone of the City's best-known investment bankers and 
currently UK head of Lazard.
RETAILERS
Tesco is putting 8,000 products, from leather sofas to Le Crueset pans, into its Tesco Direct home shopping service 
as the UK's biggest retailer looks to grab a bigger slice of the fragmented non-food market.
Baugur said it was keen to add H Samuel and Ernest Jones to its growing UK retail empire if the jewellery chains 
are put up for sale by Signet as part of a strategic review.
Steinhoff, the South African furniture group, plans to extend its base in the UK in spite of a disappointing 
performance at Homestyle, the retailer it rescued from near-bankruptcy last year. Homestyle this week revealed 
losses of Pounds 25m after raising expectations that it would break even.
BEVERAGES
THE WEEK
Diageo said this week that global geopolitical uncertainty had made it cautious in its profit forecasts as the reported 
an 11 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profit to Pounds 2.1bn.Problems abroad compounded a decline in sales of its 
flagship beer brand Guinness in its core market of Ireland. Thecompany suffered a fall in liquor sales in Lebanon 
following the Lebanese war. It alsoexperienced a drop in sales of duty-free products after the British and US 
governments imposed restrictions on carrying liquids on transatlantic flights following an alleged terrorist plot.
SUPPORT SERVICES
Amec reported Pounds 58m in interim losses following a write-down in its construction division, offsetting a healthier 
performance from the rest of the business. Sir Peter Mason, chief executive, ruled out further write-downs but 
warned that the UK construction business was unlikely to pick-up until next year.
Lawyers for an Interserve shareholder have sent a letter to the company's board demanding more information 
about the accounting irregularities that caused the support services company's shares to losea fifth of their value 
earlier this month.
MEDIA
Johnston Press painted a bleak picture of the advertising market this week noting there was nothing to point to an 
early recovery in revenues. The company reported a 3 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profit to Pounds 79.8m.
Daily Mail & General Trust added to its growing portfolio of online businesses this week with a deal to buy Simply 
Energy, a site that comparesthe prices of household utility bills, in a deal valued at Pounds 22m.
Shares in St Ives lost a tenth of their value after the printing group announced a Pounds 2.8m profit write-down 
following the discovery of accounting irregularities.The write-down is equal to about 11 per cent of expected full-
year pre-tax profit for this year. Analysts are forecasting pre-taxprofit of Pounds 24.5m on turnover of Pounds 400m.
TRANSPORTATION
The pleasure - or pain - of inflight mobile phone use came a significant step closer as Ryanair, the European low-
cost carrier, announced plans toequip its fleet with anonboard mobile service by next year.
The Irish government and Aer Lingus yesterday launched the formal process for the part privatisation of the state-
owned flag-carrier through an initial public offering, which is expected to value the airline at between Euros 750m 
(Pounds 507m) and Euros 950m.

Taking a cruise used to be one of the few ways for travellers to get away from it all, blissfully out of telephonic reach 
- except in an emergency - until the ship docked. Not so today.
Cingular Wireless, the biggest US mobile carrier, is busy wiring many of the world's biggest cruise ships with the 
equipment needed to make and receive mobile phone calls, send text messages or check e-mail using passengers' 
own handsets.
The news comes days after Ryanair, the cut-price airline, said it would equip its fleet of aircraft with an onboard 
mobile service by next year.
Cingular, through its Wireless Maritime Services joint venture with Maritime Telecommunications Network, is rapidly 
cornering the expanding cruise ship mobile telephony market, signing up many of the biggest cruise ship lines 
including Carnival Cruise Lines, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean.
WMS already provides cellular service for eight cruise lines and has roaming agreements in place with more than 
300 carriers, on both GSM and rival CDMA, in over 180 countries.
That means that in most cases passengers who bring their own mobile phones - or Blackberries - can use them on 
board paying the same sort of roaming fees they would if they were visiting a foreign country.
"A year ago we had seven ships and now we have 31 ships fitted out," said Leighton Carroll, chief executive of the 
WMS joint venture. "By the end of this year it will be 50-plus." And usage is also soaring - up 1,000 per cent over 
the past year, according to Mr Carroll.

The party's over. For 10 years we've got up at unholy hours of the night, scurried across rainy tarmacs to be stuffed 
in the back of budget jets and got out the other end at airports miles from the cities they're supposed to serve. We 
didn't care. Our love affair with cheap flights enabled us to criss-cross Europe for a day's shopping in Milan or a 
stag weekend in Prague.
Then the passion cooled. As Mark Smith, train buff and creator of the website www.seat61.com says: "Cut price 
airlines are the burger and fries of travel." We always knew low-budget flying was an unpleasant experience: now 
we have learned that it's an environmental disaster, with airline emissions a big contributor to global warming. The 
last straw came with the alleged UK terrorist plot this August. On the day the authorities announced its discovery, 
turning Britain's airports into refugee camps for stranded passengers, Mark Smith's website had 12,000 hits - 
double its usual daily number. Over the next four days, Eurostar carried an extra 28,000 people (a 27 per cent 
increase).
Welcome to the (second) golden age of the train. "European trains have been getting better," Rod Maton, managing 
director of International Rail, the travel agency, says. "There are more high-speed tracks and the seats are 
comfortable. A huge amount of money is going into trains because it is a good system, but it takes a long time with 
rail for things to change because it is so expensive to build new trains, rails or stations."
Still standing in the way of a switch from air travel back to rail - for short-haul trips at least - are three obstacles: 
cost, convenience and information. Riding the rails around Europe often does cost more than going by Ryanair or 
Easyjet but the difference can be small once you remember hidden charges such as taxes and the price of those 
extended journeys between low-budget airports and city centres. The same is true of convenience. Flying may 
seem a lot quicker than taking the train but add getting to and from airports (train stations are typically situated in 
the heart of cities) and those dreaded snakelike airport queues at check-in and security, now ever longer and more 
soul-destroying, and the train can end up more convenient and timely than the plane.
 All aboard for the future of real travel Carolyn Lyons gives the airport queues a miss and takes the train for a 
proper journey across Europe
Which leaves information, and here there is a real problem. There's simply no comparison between the cut-price 
airlines with their user-friendly, online booking services and the tortuous process of trying to find out times and 
trains and then buying tickets for a rail journey to the Continent. "Making a European train trip is really simple and 
quite affordable and is a great experience but finding out about it and buying your tickets can be a nightmare," 
Smith agrees. "I started my site to fill that gap." In previous times, Mark would have been an anorak with his nose in 
the Thomas Cook Timetable; now he's a computer geek who shares his vast knowledge with us via the internet. He 
is kind and gentle and explains the problem. "Eurostar is only interested in London to Paris. The national train 
companies around Europe are only interested in their own domestic trains. No one says, 'Look, if you want to go 
from London by train to Spain or Greece or Moscow, this is the best train time, this is roughly how much it costs and 
this is the best place to buy tickets.'"
Seat61.com does take me by the hand and explain carefully in what order I should book the trains, which is the best 
site to book online and what a couchette looks like ("a padded ledge"). Armed with his information, Smith thinks 
booking becomes as simple as booking a cut-price airline ticket and then working out how to get to Stansted 
Airport. He actually "likes booking online because I can play around and see what is available and what the options 
are." But I think it's still too hard without talking to somebody, like an agent. Fortunately, there are a number of 
specialised international rail travel agents. They charge a modest booking fee, but as International Rail's Samantha 
Plank says, "if you are only doing a short journey and it is a direct train, it is very easy to book online. For anything 
longer with changes, it is much easier to phone and chat."
Having got Sam to book my ticket, I decided to try the train myself. I started my journey back to London from 
Orvieto in central Italy. Orvieto station is small and yellow, with a platform going north and another going south, 
each one with three large clocks, all six of which show a different time. It is calm and quiet except when the bell 
rings to signal my train approaching from Rome.
The journey is cool, fast but leaves me totally unprepared for the fuggy heat and crowded chaos of Milano Centrale, 
a monumentally grand station started in 1912 but finished and decorated by the Fascists. I pull my suitcase along 
and heave it up the steep steps (why are Continental trains so high?) on to the train for Switzerland. The train chugs 
along beside lakes, stopping frequently. At Como, I look down on lakeside rooftops before entering Switzerland; but 
the border at Chiasso is invisible - only the station clocks have changed. Now they are correct, stylish and modern, 
with a big red dot swinging round on the second hand.
We head up the valley and through the Alps, with more snow than bright green flowered pastures, even in July. It is 
a magical journey. I see cars and lorries hacking up and down the mountains, disappearing in and out of tunnels, as 
I glide smoothly along, drinking my coffee at the bar. At Zurich HB, the station tries to rival Milan's, cavernous and 
elegant with shops and cafes concealed in dark green arches while below the tracks is a whole underground 
shopping city.
Trains are fun. Children love them, especially the overnight sleepers. Pets are welcome as well. (They are banned 
on Eurostar, but you can take them on P&O Ferries across the Channel). However, rail's real trump card is that they 
treat you like an adult. Travel writer James Hamilton-Paterson recently described economy air travel as a process 
"calculated to infantilise the passengers" who are "effectively told to keep quiet and strapped in, like recalcitrant 
infants". Only in first class was he "treated like an ordinary adult".
As Smith points out, trains by contrast "aren't nanny states. There's nothing stopping you bringing your own bottle 
of champagne or picnic on board if you choose." Next time I go back to Orvieto, I'll take Eurostar to Paris, a taxi to 
Paris Bercy and the night sleeper. Instead of paying Ryanair Pounds 88.75, British Rail to Stansted Pounds 25; the 
coach into Rome Pounds 9.50 (total Pounds 123.25 return), I'll buy a Eurostar ticket for Pounds 59 and book an 
overnight couchette to Rome for Pounds 57 (Pounds 113 return).
Actually I'm thinking of splurging and reserving a first class sleeper for two at Pounds 216 return. Either way, it will 
be my contribution to saving the environment for my granddaughter and I will arrive in Rome having had a 
wonderful time. Who knows in the future I might just buy a timetable and even an anorak - do they sell pink ones?
 All aboard for the future of real travel Carolyn Lyons gives the airport queues a miss and takes the train for a 
proper journey across Europe

 Scott Carson has been appointed to lead Boeing Commercial Airplanes as its president and chief executive officer. 
James Jamieson has been named chief operating officer at Boeing Commercial. British Airways estimated that the 
security alerts in August cost the company Â£40 million ($76.2 million). The flag carrier says that it had to cancel 
1,280 flights from all London airports. The disruptions had an effect on forward bookings. 
The newly formed Gulf Flight Safety Committee has meet in Manama, Bahrain. More than 20 airline representatives 
and others from safety organizations discussed various matters concerning airline safety. Hong Kong-based airline 
Dragonair has been approved by the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department as a type rated training organization. 
The airline can offer type rate training on a number of specific aircraft types such as A320s, A330s and 747s to a 
more widely recognized global standard. Brazilian low-cost airline GOL has released good August operating 
statistics. System-wide passenger traffic was 72.4% higher and capacity was up 47% on the corresponding month 
in 2005. This improved the load factor by 11.3 points to 76.9%. Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair carried more than four 
million passengers in August. It is a record for the airline. The number of passengers that were carried was 
4,002,358. The airline gave away four million free seats on its European routes to celebrate this milestone. Mario 
Heinen has taken over as head of Airbus' A380 programme. Alain Flourens will head the single-aisle programme, 
replacing Heinen. Charles Champion was replaced as head of the A380 programme, but will be a special adviser to 
the Airbus chief executive officer Christian Strieff. Norwegian, the airline, has released its August operating 
numbers showing that it carried 515,679 passengers, an increase of 60% over the August 2005 figures. 
International and domestic passenger figures increased by 67% and 54%, respectively. Swedish airline FlyMe has 
acquired 51% of the British airline Astraeus for Â£6 million ($11.4 million). The remaining 49% is held by Aberdeen 
Asset Management and airline management. With the acquisition of Astraeus, the FlyMe Group operate 15 aircraft. 
Central European low-cost airline SkyEurope reported nine-month figures to June 30 2006 showing net operating 
figures of (TM)95.7 million ($120.1 million) and a net loss after tax of (TM)50.2 million. BAE Systems appears to be 
a step closer to the sale of its stake in Airbus, pending the outcome of an audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The 
UK aerospace and defence manufacturer called for an independent audit after the NM Rothschild valuation, which 
deemed BAE Systems' Airbus stake to be worth (TM)2.75 billion ($3.5 billion). The BAE Systems board will 
recommend the results of the audit to shareholders, who will be asked to vote at an EGM. British-based low-cost 
carrier FlyBe has taken delivery of its first Embraer 195. The ceremony took place at the Embraer headquarters at 
San Jose dos Campos in Brazil. The airline has ordered 14 aircraft with an option for a further 12. Delta Airlines 
filed its monthly operating report for July with the US Bankruptcy Court. It reported a net income, excluding re-
organization fees, of $99 million and a net income after those fees of $69 million. Cyprus Airways reported total 
News in brief 
revenue of CÂ£86.8 million ($190.8 million) for the first six months of 2006. The airline reported a net loss for the 
period of CÂ£23.3 million. Hainan Airlines in China has ordered 50 ERJ 145s and 50 Embraer 190s. The list price of 
the firm order is $2.7 billion. The ERJ 145s will be built in China at the Harbin joint-venture factory. Deliveries are 
due to start in September 2007. BAA dismissed calls from BA and Ryanair for the break-up of its UK airports. The 
airports operator claimed that a more fragmented ownership structure would undermine investment. Ryanair 
announced it is to allow the use of mobile phones on its entire fleet of 737 aircraft. A deal with inflight 
communications specialist OnAir means that, subject to regulatory approval, from mid-2007 passengers will be able 
to call, text and email using mobile phones, BlackBerrys and Treos at international roaming rates. Franco-Dutch 
airline Air France-KLM announced operating income of (TM)936 million ($1.2 billion), up 69% for the first quarter of 
last year. Revenues were also increased by 10% to (TM)21.4 billion. These profits prompted the airline to forecast 
that its investment for 2006-2007 would amount to about (TM)2.1 billion. US Airways has ordered seven A321-200 
aircraft. It had previously converted eight A320s. The new aircraft will accommodate 183 passengers in two 
classes. The recently merged US Airways and America West fly 205 Airbus aircraft. The airline industry is to halve 
its losses in 2006 because of economic growth, efficiency and hard work, according to the International Air 
Transport Association (Iata). Air Malta has lost 28 pilots in the past two years, about 20% of its total. The pilots have 
decamped to airlines in Europe and the Middle East, such as Emirates, Gulf Air and Qatar Airlines, because pay 
rates at the Malta flag carrier are too low. 
The Airline Pilots Association (Alpa) says that Air Malta pays only LM26,000 ($78,000) a year for a pilot with five 
years' experience and LM17,000 for first officers. Alpa claims that pilots at low-cost airline Ryanair, for instance, 
earn about LM62,000 and first officers LM42,000, while Emirates pays pilots LM36,000 tax free. It adds that 
captains on these carriers also get better perks.

Breaking up BAA, the airports operator, would be bad for passengers and the economy, the group said yesterday in 
evidence submitted to the Office of Fair Trading.
BAA's leading customers, including British Airways and Ryanair, have called for the break-up of the group.
But in evidence to the OFT's review of the UK's airports, BAA argued that more fragmented ownership would 
undermine vitally needed in-vestment in airport capacity.
Stephen Nelson, BAA chief executive, said the airlines' calls for a break-up of BAA and for heavier price regulation 
would be a "poisonous cocktail for consumers".
Mr Nelson said "I fully understand why airlines like British Airways and Ryanair want to weaken airport operators 
and achieve greater control over prices and investment at the airports where they hold such powerful positions 
themselves, but the job of the competition authorities is to protect the longer-term interests of all consumers.
"The biggest problem facing UK air travellers is the shortage of airport capacity, especially in south-east England. 
Failure to build new runway capacity will lead to gridlock, disappointed customers and significant loss to the national 
economy."
BAA said the threat to investment from break-up would "outweigh any possible benefits to consumers in terms of 
choice, price or quality of service".
It said its airports were already among the cheapest in Europe in terms of landing charges, which were heavily 
subsidised by BAA's retail activities and were regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority. BAA is planning to invest 
Pounds 9.5n in its three London airports in the next 10 years, chiefly at Heathrow and Stansted.
It is nearing the completion of the first phase of the Pounds 4.2bn project to build a fifth terminal at Heathrow, which 
will create capacity to handle 35m passengers a year when it opens in March 2008. It is also aiming to seek 
planning permission early next year for the Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.5bn Heathrow East project, to build a new 
terminal to replace the existing Terminals 1 and 2.
BAA dismisses calls to end monopoly AIRPORTS
At Stansted, BAA is pursuing the Pounds 2.7bn project recommended by the government to build a second runway 
and terminal, which would triple the capacity of London's third airport to 76m passengers a year, more than the 
current size of Heathrow.
Ferrovial, the Spanish construction, infrastructure and services group, which acquired BAA this year, has said it is 
committed to the expansion plan but is reviewing in particular the scale of the planned spending at Stansted.
Calling for the break-up of the BAA's London airports monopoly, Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, said Heathrow 
and Stansted should not be owned by the same company.

BAA PLC, which owns Heathrow and two other major London airports, on Thursday urged government regulators 
not to force a breakup of the company's holdings.
British Airways and budget carrier Ryanair have both recently suggested there would be benefits in changing the 
ownership structure for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports the three busiest airports in Britain, all serving 
London.
In a submission to the Office of Fair Trading, BAA said the threat to investment from breaking up the company 
would outweigh any benefits to consumers.
"I fully understand why airlines like British Airways and Ryanair want to weaken airport operators and achieve 
greater control over prices and investment at the airports where they hold such powerful positions themselves, but 
the job of the competition authorities is to protect the longer-term interests of all consumers," BAA Chief Executive 
Stephen Nelson said.
BAA owns and operates airports which handled 63 percent of air passengers in Britain in 2005. Its airports in 
Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen give BAA an 86 percent share in Scotland. In London, BAA has 92 percent of 
air passenger traffic.
The Office of Fair Trading announced in May it was considering a full inquiry into the domestic airport market. The 
current process could lead to a possible referral to the Competition Commission.
Since the May announcement, BAA agreed to a takeover bid by a consortium led by Grupo Ferrovial SA of Spain.
Last week, British Airways called for consideration of separate ownership of Stansted, a hub for regional budget 
carriers, and Heathrow, British Airways' main base.
BAA PLC , owner of major London airports, rejects airlines' calls to break up company
"The airline believes that decisions on new runway construction in southeast England should not be concentrated in 
the hands of one company," British Airways said in its submission to the Office of Fair Trading.
Ryanair, calling for a breakup of BAA, complained that government regulators had "failed to prevent BAA from 
developing gold-plated facilities that do not meet the requirements of the airlines and their passengers and have led 
to inflated airport charges for consumers."
Nelson said the biggest problem for British air travelers is a shortage of airport capacity, particularly in London and 
southeast England.
"Despite this, some airlines want to break up BAA and impose even heavier price regulation," Nelson said. "This 
have-it-both-ways proposal would be a poisonous cocktail for consumers. It risks setting back the much needed 
investment program which BAA is pursuing, to transform London's airports through projects like Heathrow Terminal 
5, Heathrow East and the Stansted second runway."

The pleasure - or pain - of inflight mobile phone use came a significant step closer yesterday as Ryanair, the 
European low-cost carrier, announced plans to equip its fleet with an onboard mobile service by next year.
"If you want a quiet flight, use another airline," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive. "Ryanair is noisy, full and we 
are always trying to sell you something."
The airline announced a deal with OnAir to equip its fleet of Boeing 737-800s over the next two years, with the first 
calls being made in July next year, subject to regulatory approval.
Air France plans to launch the first trial on a single aircraft in February and further trials will be made by BMI British 
Midland and TAP Air Portugal in the second quarter of next year. A rival system developed by AeroMobile is to be 
tried by Qantas on a Boeing 767 on domestic routes in Australia in early 2007.
Fliers worried about lack of sleep on long-haul flights can rest easy - at least for part of the time. Pilots can control 
the service and are likely to switch to "silent" mode on night flights, blocking calls but allowing text messages.
The systems are being launched just as Boeing prepares to abandon Connexion, its own loss-making in-flight 
communications service, which provides internet and e-mails but not mobile telephony.
Existing in-flight services using handsets fixed in the cabin have failed to take off, with high prices a significant 
deterrent.
Verizon Communications said in June it would cancel its US service, which cost Dollars 3.99 for a connection and 
Dollars 4.99 per minute for calls to fixed lines.
Ryanair will receive commission payments based on the level of phone usage.

their mobile phones, BlackBerrys and Treos at rates, which will mirror international roaming charges. Ryanair will 
receive a commission from OnAir on call revenues generated by passengers. 'The revenues generated by onboard 
mobile telephony will reduce our costs and help us to keep offering the lowest fares in Europe while at the same 
time doubling the size of our operation over the next five years as we grow to carry 80 mln passengers annually by 
2012,' said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive. OnAir will fit 50 Ryanair aircraft during the second half of 
2007, with the remainder of the 200 plus fleet receiving installations from early 2008. Mobile OnAir will be offered on 
all Ryanair flights across its network of 371 routes serving 23 countries across Europe.

Shares in Dublin closed marginally higher today for the fifth consecutive day and above the 8000 level for the first 
time since May.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 12.11 points higher on 8006.32.
Investor sentiment was also boosted by a positive start on Wall Street, where stocks clocked up gains on the back 
of increased oil stockpiles and benign second quarter GDP figures.
 Oil prices eased below the USD70 per barrel mark after the US government reported a rise in oil inventories, 
mitigating supply worries as tomorrow's deadline nears for Iran to halt its nuclear program. Inventories of crude oil, 
gasoline, and distillate fuels - which include heating oil and diesel - all rose last week, according to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration, compared to expectations of lower inventories. Gains in Dublin were capped in late 
afternoon trading as dealers began to exercise caution ahead of tomorrow's European Central Bank meeting. The 
ECB will likely keep its key interest rate unchanged when its governing council meets, but analysts will be watching 
for signs of an increase coming at its next meeting in October. The Frankfurt-based bank last raised the refinancing 
rate on August 3, from 2.75 to 3pc. CRH was in positive territory for the second consecutive day after it announced 
strong profits for the first six months of the year on Tuesday. The building materials firm posted a 34pc rise in profits 
to E384m - well ahead of expectations. It also said it was on track to post a 'healthy' full year rise. Elsewhere in the 
sector, Grafton fell 7c to 1055, while McInerney was up 10c to 1285. Shares in Kingspan did not fare so well 
however, slipping 18c to 1397. Financial stocks also struggled to make any real headway, but managed to keep 
losses to a minimum. AIB slipped 2c to 2028, while Anglo Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland both fell 3c to close on 
1294 and 1494 respectively. Irish Life and Permanent managed to buck the trend, tacking on an impressive 28c to

The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) today confirmed plans to build a new E395m terminal at Dublin Airport capable 
of handling up to 15 million passengers a year.
Construction of T2 is due to begin in the second quarter of next year and the new terminal will open in the Autumn 
of 2009.
The DAA said the new terminal "will transform the passenger experience for travellers using Dublin Airport and 
raise capacity at the airport to a potential 35 million passengers per year".
 "T2 will provide an elegant and contemporary gateway for twenty-first century Ireland," said DAA chairman Gary 
McGann. "It provides a cost effective solution to Dublin Airport's current capacity deficit that meets the 
Government's requirement for delivery by 2009 and it represents a further significant milestone for the DAA in its 
commitment to deliver on its key shareholder and customer objectives." It was announced that the terminal will 
feature large airy spaces in areas such as check-in, baggage reclaim, security and the departures lounge. The 
75,000 square metre building will also have dedicated facilities to meet the needs of business travellers and families 
travelling with young children, the DAA said. Transport Minister Martin Cullen today said that T2 is a significant 
development for the country as people coming to Ireland for the first time would get a positive view of the country 
through the airport. The Minister paid tribute to the DAA and said it was a very important day for Dublin Airport and 
the travelling public. The Minister said that is was also a good day for airlines such as Aer Lingus and Ryanair as it 
fits into their expansion ambitions.

Spain is becoming one of the main battlegrounds for the low-cost carriers after the UK and Germany.
EasyJet, the number two low-cost airline in Europe, is intensifying its challenge to the European flag-carriers with 
the announcement last week that it plans to open its first base in Spain at Madrid's Barajas airport.
Both EasyJet and Ireland's Ryanair are carving out large shares of the European aviation market with the opening 
of a growing number of strategic operating bases around continental Europe with the aim of becoming the largest 
short-haul carriers in Europe by the end of the decade.
EasyJet's move to increase its presence in Madrid, including the launch of its first Spanish domestic routes, will add 
to fierce competition in one of Europe's biggest aviation markets.
Ryanair already has a fast-growing base at Barcelona-Gerona and has also been awarded take-off and landing 
slots for possible expansion at Madrid Barajas.
EasyJet said it would open its Madrid base next February, initially with three or four locally based aircraft.
It is already the fourth- largest operator at Barajas after Iberia; Spanair, a subsidiary of SAS Scandinavian Airlines; 
and Air Europa.
It currently operates nine routes to Madrid, carrying 900,000 passengers last year.
Spain is its second-largest market after the UK with 7.5m passengers carried on its Spanish routes last year, which 
include 11 Spanish airports.
 UK AND IRELAND: EasyJet taking aim at Spain TRAVEL & LEISURE: The low-cost carrier's decision to open 
a base in Madrid will increase competition in one of Euro....
Andy Harrison, EasyJet chief executive, said Spain had "excellent opportunities for growth" and said Madrid was 
"still under-served by low fares airlines".
There is growing competition, however.
Vueling, the Spanish low- cost start-up that began flying in July 2004, is developing bases in both Madrid and 
Barcelona. It hopes to have a fleet of 16 180-seat Airbus A320s by the end of 2006,rising to 25 in 2007.
The airline, which is owned 40 per cent by Apax Partners, the UK private equity group, and 30 per cent by 
Inversiones Hemisferio, a subsidiary of Grupo Planeta, the Spanish media group, is planning an initial public 
offering in late 2007 or early 2008.
A seven per cent stakein Vueling is held byVA Investors, led by Dave Barger, president of JetBlue Airways, the US 
low-cost carrier.
The opening of a base by EasyJet in Madrid, its 17th in Europe, will add tough competition for Iberia, the Spanish 
flag-carrier, which is already facing heavypressure from other low-cost carriers across Spain.
Iberia, which has itself been cutting lossmaking short-haul routes, is responding to the competitive threat by leading 
the start-up of another low-cost carrier from a base in Barcelona, which is due to start flying in October. It will trade 
under the brand name, Clickair. Iberia holds an initial 20 per cent stake but has an option to raise this later.
The battle for the Spanish market has also been joined by Spanair, which is aiming to increase its passenger 
volumes by 50 per cent by 2010 to 15m with the focus of expansion on creating aBarcelona hub.
EasyJet's pan-European expansion strategy has previously led to it opening bases in Germany in Berlin and 
Dortmund, in Switzerland at Geneva and Basel, as well as in Paris and earlier this year at Milan Malpensa airport. 
In addition, it has has 10 operating bases in the UK led by the three London airports Gatwick, Luton and Stansted. It 
handled 32.4m passengers in the 12 months to July compared with 37.6m at Ryanair.
The Irish carrier has16 European bases, including eight in continental Europe, and is planning to announce two 
more later this yearfor launch in the first halfof 2007.
The airlines are expanding in Spain to take advantage of the big increase of capacity at Madrid's Barajas airport, 
which has doubled the number of runways from two to four and has opened a new fourth terminal. The facilities are 
part of a Euros 6bn (Pounds 4bn) 10-year programme to overhaul the airport, which will allow it to increase the 
passenger capacity by 68 per cent to about 70m a year.
The two new 3.5km runways will allow the airport to deal with up to 120 aircraft movements an hour. In a first step, 
capacity is being raised in the coming winter season from 78 to 90 take-offs and landings an hour.

Hopes of a bid worth around 132p a share for jewellery group Signet retreated this morning and the stock slumped 
8.75p to 106.5p with the 30 million going through the market making it the most active in the FTSE 250.
Last week corporate raider Apax & Kohlberg Kravis abandoned its plans to bid for the US end of the group, and 
broker Numis later put out a 'reduce' recommendation and a target price of 96p.
The beginning of the hurricane season made New York nervous on Monday, but the weakening of Tropical Storm 
Ernesto calmed things down and crude oil prices eased. The Dow Jones industrial index finished below its 11,387 
points high, but still 67.96 points higher at 11,352.01.
Oil remains over $70 a barrel, however, buoyed by the lingering concerns in the Middle East with Iran's missile tests 
over the weekend confirming its continued defiance of UN demands over uranium enrichment. BP fell 3p to 602.5p 
in sympathy, while Cairn Energy fell 10p to Â£20.68 and Shell 8p at Â£18.66.
Airlines benefited from the lower oil price with British Airways, 13.5p higher at 411.625p, taking it to the top of the 
FTSE 100 leader board and to its highest level since February 200. Over 8.7 million shares went through the 
market.
easyJet added 13.75p to 449p, while Ryanair hardened 0.335 to 7.475. Carnival, up 46p to Â£21.64, whose shares 
have suffered since its profit warning in May, was another beneficiary.
Buyers were generally slow to return to the market after the long weekend and prices were marked down in the first 
hour, forcing the FTSE to a low of 5,896.6, down 18 points. The remainder of the morning was brighter, the FTSE 
100 hitting 5,921.3 at 10.48. At 1.30 pm it was 32.8 points better at 5,911.4.
Both the FTSE 250 and FTSE 350 also moved into higher territory, but the FTSE AIM All-Share eased 1.8 points to 
1,043.9. Volume was poor with 772.6 million shares changing hands in 121,983 deals.
Antofagasta, 12p better at 445p, was the centre of attention in the mining sector as its interim figures hit a new 
record. Its shares were the third best performer of the morning. Close behind was Xstrata, 55p up to Â£23.89, 
Kazakhmys, 21p higher at Â£12.42, and BHP Billiton, ahead 14p at Â£10.14. Lonmin was the weakest stock in the 
sector, down 18p to Â£27.34.
Tuesday Lunchtime Market: FTSE higher as Signet bid hopes decline
Among the leaders to lose ground were BG Group, down 8.5p to 685.5p, Rentokil, 1.75p lower at 150.75, and 
power station Drax which lost 6p to 912.5p. In the FTSE 250, Victrex was the best performer, up 29p to 750.5p.
Wall Street will this week be looking for more evidence to see whether or not the US economy is slowing down. 
Encouraging figures from Wal-Mart helped lift share prices on Monday, but the market today is expected to be flat.
Paris shares were also helped by the easier oil price, the CAC-40 being 31.06 points better at 5,179.58 at 12.46 
pm. By 11.53 in Frankfurt the DAX 30 had added 22.16 points to 5,877.15.
In the currency markets the pound firmed against both the Euro, moving from last week's closing 1.4814 to 1.4822, 
and the US dollar where the rate went from 1.8949 to 1.8991.

Ireland to privatize state-owned Aer Lingus airline Sept. 29

The Irish government will sell most of its stake in Aer Lingus Group PLC next month to permit the airline to buy new 
aircraft and expand services worldwide, the government and company directors announced Monday.
The Sept. 29 flotation on the British and Irish stock exchanges is expected to raise about â¬400 million (more than 
US$500 million) and enable the airline to borrow up to â¬2 billion (US$2.5 billion) from banks for the purchase of new 
long-haul and short-haul aircraft.
Transport Minister Martin Cullen said the sale would "give Aer Lingus both the commercial flexibility and the 
financial strength to succeed in what is a highly competitive global marketplace."
The Aer Lingus chairman, John Sharman, said the sale "will give the company access to the wider capital markets 
and enable it to realize its full potential. Aer Lingus and its staff can now look forward to the future with confidence."
The joint government-Aer Lingus statement said qualifying investors would need to commit a minimum of â¬10,000 
(US$12,800). It said the price of Aer Lingus stock would be fixed a few days before the flotation following a meeting 
of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
The government currently holds more than 243 million shares, or an 85.1 percent share, of Aer Lingus stock, while 
an employee trust holds the remaining 42 million, or 14.9 percent. Until now, the public has been unable to trade 
Aer Lingus shares.
Cullen said the government would retain a minimum 25.1 percent stake in the privatized Aer Lingus. He said this 
holding would be strong enough to block the sale of airline assets considered of Irish public interest, such as Aer 
Lingus' current landing slots in Heathrow Airport in London.
Ahern has been considering a sale of Aer Lingus since he came to power in 1997, but has repeatedly delayed the 
move because of the potential of labor-union unrest and fears a that a flotation could prove unpopular with the wider 
public. The government's previous privatization, of state telephone company Eircom in 1999, proved a bad deal for 
investors, most of whom lost about two-thirds of their money.
Ireland to privatize state-owned Aer Lingus airline Sept. 29
Aer Lingus came close to collapse in 2002 amid heavy losses caused by a bloated payroll and the effects of the 
Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. But the company made a rapid return to profit by slashing staff 
nearly in half and introducing a low-fares, Internet-based system that mimicked its principal domestic rival, Ryanair.

State-owned Aer Lingus airline plans stock sale next month

Aer Lingus Group PLC expects to raise more than $500 million by selling stock for the first time in a public offering 
next month, the government and directors of the state-owned airline announced Monday.
The flotation, slated for Sept. 29 on the British and Irish stock exchanges, will give the airline more resources to buy 
new aircraft and expand services worldwide, the announcement said.
"This is the right decision for the company, its employees, customers and Ireland, and it is taking place in order to 
give Aer Lingus both the commercial flexibility and the financial strength to succeed in what is a highly competitive 
global marketplace," Transport Minister Martin Cullen said.
Cullen said the sale would give Aer Lingus "the access to capital it needs to develop new routes and to grow."
The sale is expected to raise about 400 million euros and enable the airline to borrow up to 2 billion euros ($2.5 
billion) from banks for the purchase of new long-haul and short-haul aircraft.
The Aer Lingus chairman, John Sharman, said the sale "will give the company access to the wider capital markets 
and enable it to realize its full potential. Aer Lingus and its staff can now look forward to the future with confidence."
The joint government-Aer Lingus statement said qualifying investors would need to commit a minimum of 10,000 
euros ($12,800). It said the price of Aer Lingus stock would be fixed a few days before the flotation following a 
meeting of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
The government currently holds more than 243 million shares, or an 85.1 percent share, of Aer Lingus stock, while 
an employee trust holds the remaining 42 million, or 14.9 percent. But the shares have not been publicly traded.
Cullen said the government would retain a minimum 25.1 percent stake in the privatized Aer Lingus. He said this 
holding would be strong enough to block the sale of airline assets considered of Irish public interest, such as Aer 
Lingus' current landing slots in Heathrow Airport in London.
State-owned Aer Lingus airline plans stock sale next month
Ahern has been considering a sale of Aer Lingus since he came to power in 1997, but has repeatedly delayed the 
move because of the potential of labor-union unrest and fears a that a flotation could prove unpopular with the wider 
public. The government's previous privatization, of state telephone company Eircom in 1999, proved a bad deal for 
investors, most of whom lost about two-thirds of their money.
Aer Lingus came close to collapse in 2002 amid heavy losses caused by a bloated payroll and the effects of the 
Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. But the company made a rapid return to profit by slashing staff nearly in 
half and introducing a low-fares, Internet-based system that mimicked its principal domestic rival, Ryanair.
Nonetheless, the government and company directors agreed that the company needed to sell shares to drum up 
sufficient capital to invest in a new fleet of aircraft. They cited the fact that European Union competition law severely 
restricts the ability of state-owned airlines to expand through taxpayer subsidies.
Aer Lingus says it wants to increase its short-haul routes to continental Europe in competition with Ryanair, 
increase the number of locations it serves in the United States it currently operates from New York, Boston, 
Chicago and Los Angeles and pursue potential new routes to Asia and South Africa.

The Dublin market began the week as it finished the previous one today, moving sharply higher and ever closer to a 
return to the 8000 level.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 43.63 points higher on 7917.47.
After breaking through the 8000 in May, Irish shares went in to free-fall during June, falling below the 7000 level.
 Since then, shares have steadily regained ground as inflation and interest rate fears have eased. Investor 
sentiment was buoyed by a positive start on Wall Street. Leading US shares rebounded due to a drop in oil prices, 
which reassured investors nervous about a series of major economic reports expected this week. With the market 
uneasy about inflation and interest rates, the market welcomed the drop in crude, which fell USD2.01 to USD70.50 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after Hurricane Ernesto was downgraded to a tropical storm. A weaker storm 
poses less of a threat to oil installations off the Gulf Coast. Back in Dublin, construction shares led the way with 
CRH jumping 45c to 2625, while Grafton tacked on 7c to 1037 and Kingspan closed 8c higher on 1400. Elsewhere, 
shares in McInerney were also in the black, climbing 3c to 1163. The financials failed to perform as well, with only 
Anglo Irish Bank managing to make any headway, climbing 15c to 1295. Meanwhile, Bank of Ireland led the fallers, 
slipping 13c to 1483, while Irish Life and Permanent fell 5c to 1925 and AIB shed 5c to close on 2014. Shares in 
Kerry Group jumped 5c to 1710 after it was confirmed that UK buy-out group, Permira, had beaten it and other 
rivals in the race to buy Unilever's Birds Eye and Igloo brands with a E1.5bn bid. No-frills airline Ryanair was 
another share in the black after a survey showed it to be the most profitable airline in the world. The survey from 
aviation magazine, Air Transport World, found that Ryanair's profit margins are well ahead of its European low-cost 
rivals, including EasyJet, and are higher than US airline, Southwest, the carrier that pioneered the low-cost model. 
Shares in the Irish airline closed 13c higher on 723. Other notable movers included pharmaceutical group Elan, 
which climbed 41c to 1260, food and drinks group C and C, which closed 5c higher on 850, while DCC tacked on

10c to 1895. Fyffes property offshoot, Blackrock International, managed slight gains, up 1c to 045 after it confirmed 
last week that it is to invest around E90 million in developing the Glasgow headquarters of the BBC. Blackrock was 
revealed as preferred bidders for the site along with local firms Applecross Properties and Esk Properties. Shares in 
the company climbed 1c today to 039. Elsewhere, Bookmaker Paddy Power was also in the black, up 5c to 1385, 
while FBD Holdings slipped 7c to 3870 and Irish Continental climbed 5c to 1070.

Turbulence ahead as the airlines hit back BAA has not done itself any favours in avoiding break-up

Far from quietly focusing on ways of avoiding a repeat of this month's airport security chaos, the main players in 
Britain's aviation industry seem to be at each other's throats. Typically, Ryanair, the low-cost carrier, has carried 
recrimination furthest by suing the government for Pounds 3m in compensation for the flights it cancelled and 
bookings it lost in the first week after the government imposed new anti-terrorist checks. This claim probably will not 
get anywhere, any more than those that several airlines have considered making against BAA, the main UK airport 
operator, for its lack of proper contingency plans for extra staff to deal with a terrorist emergency.
However, the security row gives a little extra edge to the calls from several airlines for a break-up of BAA's near-
total monopoly of London's airports. These calls have been made in representations to the Office of Fair Trading, 
which had already launched a competition investigation into airports in June.
One of the arguments for a break-up is the complaint that BAA behaves like a typical monopolist in being 
unresponsive to customer needs. Perhaps BAA's handling of the security crisis has displayed such complacency, 
though the airport operator can claim it was acting under government orders. Equally, one of the arguments for the 
status quo has been that BAA is in the throes of a Pounds 10bn investment programme. Perhaps this programme 
will now have to be expanded to make room for more search equipment, though one way of creating more space 
would be to close some of BAA's airport shops.
So, in the end, it is hard to see how recent events change the issue of BAA's structure either way. Not that the 
airlines are really pretending it has. British Airways, for instance, has long disliked the idea of its Heathrow hub 
being used to cross-subsidise fancy facilities at Stansted that are not valued by that airport's two main users, 
Ryanair and EasyJet. Indeed these two airlines have long complained of being overcharged for what they see as 
over-building at Stansted.
Notwithstanding these objections, it is still hard to see how a break-up can remove the real difficulty of London's 
airports competing with each other, even if they were under different ownership. Such are the environmental 
constraints at Heathrow and legal ones at Gatwick that expansion through greater competition must be largely 
theoretical.
Turbulence ahead as the airlines hit back BAA has not done itself any favours in avoiding break-up
This does not, however, remove the need for an OFT inquiry (including a subsequent referral to the Competition 
Commission) into ways of improving regulation of an important industry. As we have suggested before, the OFT 
might want to steer between a status quo that many find unsatisfactory and a break-up that might simply replace 
one monopoly with several. The issue of ownership may be secondary to that of regulation.

Irish no-frills carrier, Ryanair, is the most profitable airline in the world, according to a survey from aviation 
magazine, Air Transport World.
The survey found that Ryanair's profit margins are well ahead of its European low-cost rivals, including EasyJet, 
and are higher than US airline, Southwest, the carrier that pioneered the low-cost model.
Last year, Ryanair posted an operating profit of E369 million and a net profit of E307 million compared to 
Southwest's E643 million operating profit and E429 million net.
 However, the Irish airline carried 33.4 million passengers on 107 aircraft while Southwest carried 88.5 million 
people on 453 aircraft giving the Irish firm a huge lead on a profit per passenger and a profit per aircraft basis. One 
Ryanair aircraft contributes E4 million to profits while one of Southwest's planes adds just E1.65 million to its bottom 
line, the survey found. Ryanair's nearest European challenger, Britain's EasyJet, saw a contribution of just E0.75 
million per aircraft to profits last year.

Ryanair has launched its claim against the government for compensation for damages it suffered during the first 
days of the tougher security measures introduced two weeks ago at UK airports.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said yesterday that the group was claiming just more than Pounds 3m 
to reflect its losses from cancellations and lost bookings from August 10-16.
No other airline has chosen to pursue any claims against the government as a result of the turmoil caused by the 
heightened security measures.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways, said this week, however, that the airline was "keeping all its options 
open" regarding legal action against BAA, the airports operator and a demand for compensation.
Ryanair is pursuing its claim under section 93 of the 2000 Transport Act, which says that claims can be made by 
organisations in-cluding airlines suffering "direct injury or loss" by complying with orders given under the act "in any 
time of actual or imminent hostilities or of severe international tension or of great national emergency".
It said that if its action were successful, it would donate the money to charity, and it was pursuing the claim to 
encourage the Department for Transport to return "airport security to normal".
The DfT said it did not believe Ryanair had any legal grounds for its claim. The security measures had been 
directed under the 1982 Aviation Security Act, which did not have any provisions for compensation.
Restrictions on the amount of hand luggage passengers can take on board could be eased in a few weeks' time, 
the DfT said yesterday, but future limits were still likely to be tighter than before the August 10 terror alert. "We are 
looking at changes we can make," it said. "One of those possibilities could be larger bags."
Ryanair called on the government to restore airport security to the same norms that "are followed at every other 
European international airport and on every inbound flight to the UK".
Ryanair seeks damages for security chaos
Both British Airways and BAA said they were planning to operate a full flight schedule over the bank holiday 
weekend.
Yesterday was the busiest day of the holiday, said BA, when 122,000 passengers were expected to fly compared 
with 70,000-80,000 on a normal day. There had been no cancellations and operations were running "fairly 
smoothly", although there were long queues at security checks.
BAA said it was using hundreds of extra staff at the terminals recruited from volunteers from other parts of its 
business.
BAA advised passengers flying this weekend to arrive at the airport no more than three hours before their flight was 
due to depart, and friends and family were asked not to enter the terminals to avoid congestion.

Air Berlin's original listing plan came unstuck because it thought it should be priced like EasyJet. Aer Lingus, about 
to launch its initial public offering, is unlikely to indulge in such delusions of grandeur.
The Irish carrier is used to unfavourable financial comparisons with low-cost carriers. Prodded by the example of 
Ryanair, its larger rival, and near-bankruptcy after 9/11, Aer Lingus has developed a workable business model 
which aims to combine competitive fares with better than low-cost service. Now it hopes to spread its wings a little 
further.
Dermot Mannion, chief executive, wants to add long-haul destinations and turn Dublin airport into a mini-hub. Dublin 
has a near-unique advantage - travellers can clear US immigration before boarding. But the airport needs massive 
upgrading and past attempts to turn others, like Manchester, into mini-hubs, have foundered. Aer Lingus's 
immediate challenge is to continue to reduce costs. This is crucial to its ability to compete with Ryanair. A union 
agreement appears close, but average costs per employee are still too high.
A multiple of 5.2 times prospective earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and leases - the EU 
network airlines' average - suggests a Euros 950m enterprise value. With the government and employees retaining 
40 per cent and a Euros 100m payment to the pension fund, Mr Mannion could have Euros 400m of new money. 
Hopefully the proceeds of a realistically priced IPO won't be wasted on unrealistic pipe dreams.

O'Leary said the claim also aimed "to prevent similar breakdowns at U.K. airports during future security scares by

Airline security standards should be upgraded and made common throughout the European Union amid renewed 
intelligence warnings about the terror threat to aircraft, the government has argued.
EU transport security officials will meet in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss UK proposals that would cover 
restrictions on hand luggage checks, increased screening of passengers, and an EU-wide investment programme 
for updating technology used in explosive detection.
"We are hoping for a forum that will take us to a common position on airline security across Europe, and not for a 
talking shop," said a UK official.
Britain, which with the US and Pakistan, thwarted an alleged plot at Heathrow airport to blow up several US-bound 
jets, is pressing for an agreement on measures commensurate with the new threat of terrorists smuggling liquid 
explosives on to aircraft.
Security officials at the Department for Transport said the alleged plot had exposed gaps in the ability of scanning 
machines to detect liquids that could be used in a bomb and had necessitated a "step change" in airline security 
measures.
"We can not disinvent the threat of liquid explosives so we cannot go back to the security regime that existed prior 
to August 10," said a security official
Discussions are ongoing between governments, airports and the airlines to try to strike a balance that meets the 
commercial needs to minimise disruption to air travel and the duty to ensure passenger safety.
But as Britain prepares for a busy holiday weekend, security officials repeated a warning made this week by anti-
terrorist police that the threat posed by international terrorism was "real, present, deadly, and enduring," and 
insisted that tougher measures introduced over the past two weeks needed to remain for the foreseeable future.
Call to toughen airport security across EU
They disputed claims by Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, that the size of hand luggage made no 
difference to security. They said scanning machines used in UK and other European airports were less effective on 
larger bags, making more time-consuming searches by security staff necessary.

British Airways yesterday called for the first time for the break-up of BAA's monopoly of London's airports.
Willie Walsh, BA chief executive, said that Heathrow and Stansted, the two London airports identified by the 
government for expansion, should not be owned by the same company.
The call came only two weeks after operations at Heathrow, BA's global hub, were thrown into turmoil by BAA's 
inability to respond quickly to the government's demand for tighter security procedures at UK airports.
Security was raised significantly on the morning of August 10 in the wake of the foiling of an alleged plot to blow up 
several passenger jets on transatlantic routes out of Heathrow, which led to chaos at the airport, with hundreds of 
flights cancelled, long delays and thousands of bags misplaced.
However, Mr Walsh said the call for the break-up of the BAA monopoly was in "no way influenced" by recent 
security events but was a strategic response to the study launched by the Office of Fair Trading into the UK airports 
market in June.
He said there was evidence of BAA's poor performance "well before August 10. BAA cannot use the sudden 
change (in security procedures) as the reason for its performance".
BA urged the OFT to make a reference to the Competition Commission for a full investigation of the UK airports 
market because of its "concerns about airport regulation and ownership". In the event of a break-up there would still 
need to be "strong regulation to protect users against monopoly power in particular at Heathrow and Gatwick".
Pressure for a reference to the Commission is growing across the airline industry. Ireland's Ryanair, Europe's 
biggest low-cost carrier by passenger numbers, also called yesterday for a break-up of the BAA monopoly.
EasyJet, the UK low-cost airline, said that UK airports had to be subject to "strong price regulation to stop them 
abusing their monopoly positions". It supported the break-up of BAA, but said the primary focus of the investigation 
should be on tougher regulation.
BA urges end to BAA's grip on London airports
The Transport and General Workers Union warned yesterday, however, that breaking up BAA's London airports 
would increase prices, act against consumer interests and could endanger security. Brendan Gold, TGWU national 
secretary for aviation, said: "We believe the public can see the advantages of an orderly management of the BAA 
airports, with an emphasis on safety and service rather than the introduction of competition which could only drive 
up profits at the expense of security."
BAA, the world's biggest airports group, was taken over by a consortium led by Ferrovial, the Spanish group, in 
June. Ferrovial said during its bid that it was "familiar" with the UK regulatory framework and would "co-operate 
fully" with any inquiry.
BAA controls seven UK airports: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Southampton. 
Last year it accounted for 63 per cent of all UK air passengers.

Ryanair today said that its threat to sue the UK government over what it called 'nonsensical' security at airports still 
stands.
Mr O'Leary's ultimatum to the UK Government to restore airport security measures to normal expires today.
Last week the low fares airline gave ministers seven days to implement changes to security checks described as a 
'shambles'.
 Today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said he still wanted to see changes made. 'We are threatening to sue the 
Government in the hope that we get it to go back to the normal high standards of security at London's airports, 
release the pressure on London's airports and more importantly next time we have one of these security scares at 
the airports, we force the UK Government to put in the police and the army personnel that are necessary,' he said. 
'Under the Government's new rules a very large briefcase can now be carried safely on board an aircraft but 
thousands of passengers' normal carry-on luggage which is only 20pc larger is somehow unsafe,' he added.

In the spirit of NudeAir and of Ryanair's cheeky idea about how to "put the fun back in to flying", Keith Hann, North 
Country exile from City PR, has put forward a suggestion in the Newcastle Journal for increasing consumer choice: 
"WhatTheHell airlines could be set up with the unique selling proposition that you could take whatever you liked on 
board as hand luggage, with the downside that you stood a greater risk of being blown to smithereens mid-flight."

Irish shares ended a sluggish marginally lower today as the ISEQ struggled to find any direction due to a lack of 
earnings reports and economic news.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 18.69 points lower on 7779.46.
Volume was again seasonally light with only 18 million shares changing hands.
 Mid-afternoon gains were wiped out by a slow start on U.S. markets as leading Wall Street shares came under 
pressure in early deals, as news U.S. existing home sales had hit a two year low re-ignited fears the economy has 
slowed too much. A report from the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes fell in 
July to 6.33 million units, the lowest since January 2004. Investor attention will soon turn to the next meeting of the 
US Federal Reserve, which takes place on 20 September. Speculation suggests that the Fed may be about to raise 
interest rates gain after leaving them unchanged earlier this month. Chicago Federal Reserve President Michael 
Moskow said this month's pause to the Fed's string of rate hikes was "constructive" but warned that more rate 
increases could still be needed to cut inflation. "Some additional firming of policy may yet be necessary to bring 
inflation back into the comfort zone within a reasonable period of time," Moskow said. Mr Moskow stated that the 
risk of inflation remaining too high is greater than the risk of growth being too low; therefore some additional firming 
of policy may be necessary to bring inflation back into the comfort zone within a reasonable period of time. 
Meanwhile, oil prices continue to fluctuate after hitting record highs at the end of last week. Prices dipped today 
after U.S. government data showed rising supplies of gasoline and other fuels as refiners cranked up their output. 
Analysts said traders also locked in profits after Iran offered to continue negotiations on its nuclear program. Back in 
Dublin, the financial sector endured a mixed day's trading, with AIB and Irish Life and Permanent both falling 15c to 
2015 and 1895 respectively. Elsewhere, Bank of Ireland slipped 3c to 1487, while Anglo Irish Bank jumped 15c to 
1220. The story was similar in the construction sector, with CRH down 30c to 2550, Grafton down 2c to 1035 and 
McInerney down 3c to 1142. Kingspan also closed in the red, down 9c to 1397. Other notable movers included

bookmaker Paddy Power, which put two days of losses behind it to close 15c higher on 1370, while no-frills airline 
Ryanair tacked on 6c to 714 and Kerry Group added on 15c to close on 1695. Elsewhere, DCC was another share 
in positive territory, closing 10c higher on 1890, with IAWS also jumping 10c to 1520. Pharmaceutical group Elan 
was not so fortunate however, slipping 15c to close on 1138, while C and C fell 11c to 8.59.

Restrictions on the size of hand baggage that can be taken on board aircraft at UK airports are expected to 
continue for the foreseeable future because of concerns over further terrorist plots, according to Whitehall officials.
While the level of theperceived threat was lowered at the beginning of last week from "critical", meaning there is 
specific intelligence that an attack is imminent, to "severe," meaning an attack is still "highly likely", the government 
has no plans to change the current category based on security advice that there other plots might be planned. The 
airline industry would remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks, potentially capable of causing mass casualties, unless it 
agreed to new restrictions on hand luggage, said a security adviser yesterday.
The warning came as some carriers have questioned the efficacy of current security measures.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said this week: "The size of the bag makes no difference whatsoever to 
security. A large briefcase is no more or less secure than the normal IATA-approved carry on bag. It is this illogical 
and totally ineffective security restriction that is handing the extremists an unwarranted and undeserved victory."
Some airline officials have stressed the need to weigh up the practicality of airport and airline operations against 
security measures.
European carriers have demanded that security actions should be co-ordinated throughout the European Union.
"The last thing the aviation sector needs is confusion," said Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, secretary-general of the 
Association of European Airlines.
"The US is imposing extra measures on flights originating outside the US without proper communication to airlines' 
national governments. This places airlines in the difficult situation of having to implement rules that might conflict 
with their national rules."
 Tougher measures might be needed to counter terrorist attacks Experts are warning of new sources of threat 
to aircraft, report Jimmy Burns and Kevin Done
However, security analysts have warned that the present level of security might have to be raised and that threats 
to aircraft safety could come from other sources, such as air freight.
Sally Leivesley, head of the London-based New Risk Ltd, said the alleged plot to blow up US-bound airliners from 
Heathrow should be a wake-up call to the industry that measures brought in after September 11 needed to be 
radically overhauled and upgraded on a long-term basis. "The threat is of terrorists developing methods of 
smuggling clear liquids and other components on board and exploding a bomb when a plane is flying over a 
populated area," she said.
According to Ms Leivesley, the airline industry should ban all but essential hand luggage, namely travel documents 
and money, with passengers being required to carry this in transparent plastic bags.
The measure was introduced at airports across the UK in the aftermath of the alleged plot being intercepted on 
August 10 but was relaxed four days later in favour of limiting the size of carry-on bags, a measure also 
implemented in some European countries, and only on certain routes judged to be security sensitive.
Ms Leivesley has advised the British and Australian governments as well as the private sector on counter-terrorism 
and business continuity.
In an interview with the FT, she argued that using transparent plastic bags would provide a "necessary safety valve" 
against terrorists smuggling potentially lethal liquids in small quantities. It would also help to reduce overcrowding 
and prevent bottlenecks developing, cutting the number of checks carried out by security staff.
In a view shared byother security and intelligence experts, Ms Leivesley be-lieves that international terrorism has 
for sometime been looking at waysof taking aircraft downwith explosives as an alternative option to hijacking them.
As one British intelligence source put it: "It was generally assumed after the security measures that were brought in 
after 9/11 that anyone who wanted to target the airline industry was either delusional or ex-tremely sophisticated. 
The fear now is that there are (terrorist) networks out there developing their tactics so that they can get on board 
planes."
However, other government advisers have been warning of other threats to the transport industry, making a 
coherent set of across-the-board measures difficult to implement.
In a report published in June, Lord Carlile, the government's terror watchdog, warned of private jets being used in 
terror attacks.
Before the latest alleged plot, the last big security alert at UK airports was sparked by intelligence that terrorists 
were planning to use a ground-to-air missile.
Meanwhile, since the attacks on Madrid trains and the London bombings, British transport officials have stepped up 
security on railways and the Underground but have decided against passenger checks on the grounds they would 
cripple commuter travel.

Unions at Stansted airport have called off a proposed bank holiday weekend strike after accepting a pay offer, the 
BBC reported.
The news will come as a relief to two of Stansted's biggest customers - the Irish no-frills carrier Ryanair and its 
nearest rival, easyJet.
Baggage handlers and check-in staff had threatened to walk out in a dispute with ground handling company 
Swissport, owned by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA.
 But after three days of talks, the Transport and General Workers' Union (T&G) and GMB said they had agreed to 
an improved salary deal. The BBC cited the GMB as saying Swissport had offered an 11 pct rise over two years, 
and it would recommend its members accept the offer. It said the unions had suspended strikes pending a ballot of 
members. The BBC added that planned strikes on the Gatwick Express airport train service over the holiday 
weekend were also suspended yesterday.

Airport authorities and the UK government have been condemned by airlines for the disruption caused to airports 
on 10 August by a suspected terrorist threat.
UK airports had no plans for coping with the raised national security threat level and the government has taken no 
responsibility for the disruption, even though "the uncovered terrorist plot constituted a threat against states, not 
against airlines", says the Association of European Airlines (AEA).
The International Air Transport Association's chief executive Giovanni Bisignani says: "In the case of BAA [owner of 
the three largest London airports] the airports must have a stronger contingency plan and be more proactive in 
handling the emergency."
Bisignani says BAA should have been able to call on military and police resources to help in passenger processing. 
BAA responded that it would have had to bring in 50% more staff, and that this could not be done at short notice. 
British Airways' chief executive Willie Walsh described the scenes at London Heathrow airport as like "a bad dream 
at Disneyland". Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has threatened to sue the government for compensation 
for the 270 flights he had to cancel because of "farcical Keystone Cops security measures that don't add anything 
except to block up airports".
AEA general secretary Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus says: "In higher-risk situations such as that experienced in the UK, 
all operators, including airports, should be able to adapt their measures without causing extreme disruption to their 
customers.
"Since the European Commission recently recognised that security could, and should, be publicly financed, the 
reimbursement of losses incurred by the industry in the last few days will have to be addressed at European Union 
level," says Schulte-Strathaus.

Airline passengers have been incredibly patient with air travel despite increased security measures, but unless the 
authorities' approach to security priorities changes, patience will run out. This will hurt the entire travel and tourism 
industry because discretionary air travel - both business and leisure - would then be affected. 
This might cause a slowing of growth rather than a reduction in traffic, but there will be an effect unless the 
authorities get much smarter than they are today. Europe has its problems, but not quite to the same degree as the 
USA. There are good reasons why aviation cognoscenti in America call the TSA (Transportation Security Agency) 
the Transportation Suppression Agency.
Meanwhile the good news is that it would not be difficult for the authorities - including the TSA - to get smarter than 
they are today. 
Since aviation security, like aviation safety, is ultimately a risk management rather than a risk elimination exercise, 
the security agencies would do well to take stock of their priorities in a way they have not done so far. It is true that 
threats and risks can change, and the security agencies and governments should be ready for this. But there has 
been no reassessment of what the true threats and true risks are since the inevitable knee-jerk reactions to the 9/11 
disaster, despite the fact that a lot has been learned since then. We have had time to gauge what does not 
constitute a primary risk as well as tracking the changes in what does. As Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary said in a 
typically barnstorming press conference last week, "exploding lipsticks" cannot seriously be judged a primary risk.
The clear aim for governments and agencies should be to identify the most serious security risks that pose the 
greatest dangers to air travellers. If these serious dangers can be identified by the intelligence services - and the 
UK's recent experience indicates they can - most of the security system's resources should be directed at 
preventing those. There will always be some median-level risks about which tactical judgements on surveillance 
levels have to be made, but there must be a thorough review of what is no longer dangerous. At present, for 
ordinary front-line security scanner operators, there is so much froth in the objectives they are given that it obscures 
the real dangers. While they are still instructed to look for women's cosmetics, cuticle scissors and screwdrivers in 
hand luggage they will be diverted from the task of recognising detonators or their separated components - not an 
easy job.
Threat to sanity
In a modern airliner with a hardened cockpit door operated by disciplined flight and cabin crew, the primary threat - 
indeed the only remaining onboard threat that poses a catastrophic danger - is a bomb. Given the high level of 
security risk awareness of crews and passengers today, a man in possession of a screwdriver - or even a large 
knife - will pose a risk only to the one or two passengers who might be injured during the two seconds it will take for 
everyone in the cabin to mobilise against him. A gun might be a risk to more passengers, but even then the person 
carrying the gun would lose the battle with no political or ideological aims achieved.
There are other issues. Following a UK police decision to act on the intelligence about an imminent attack on US-
bound flights, the UK home secretary John Reid raised the threat level to "critical", the highest state. That, plus 
additional hand baggage restrictions that are not an intrinsic part of the critical security state drill, created the travel 
chaos everyone has witnessed.
The howl of protest from the airlines since then has been that the intelligence agencies may have done a good job, 
but although the UK government controls security standards by law, it makes no financial provision for them, and 
certainly has no contingency plans for backing up airport security services when they are commanded to raise the 
surveillance levels because of a politically inspired terrorist plot.
The time has come for states across Europe to put their money where their mouths are. The European Commission 
and the European Parliament say governments should take financial responsibility for the security of their citizens 
when they fly just as they do when there is a threat against rail or buses. Until governments take responsibility for at 
least some of the costs of aviation security they will not feel compelled to do any joined-up thinking about it.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, yesterday attacked the government's decision to limit the size of carry-
on bags in the wake of the foiling of the alleged plot to blow up passenger jets, writes Kevin Done.
"The size of the bag makes no difference whatsoever to security. A large briefcase is no more or less secure than 
the normal IATA-approved carry-on bag. It is this illogical and totally ineffective security restriction that is handing 
the extremists an unwarranted and undeserved victory," he said in an internet discussion on FT.com.
He said: "If these requirements really did add to passenger security, they would of course be applied to all UK 
inbound flights, the London Underground and Eurotunnel. The sooner the government gets back to normality at the 
British airports, the sooner we will defeat these terrorists and extremists.
"What we urgently need for both business and ordinary passengers is to return UK airport security to normal, in the 
same way as the UK government successfully restored the London Underground to normal two days after the 7/7 
outrage."
Red24, the security agency, warned against a "whole load of company executives from the same company 
travelling together". "If they do, and there is an accident, you could end up with a scenario where the entire board of 
a company disappears in one go," it said.

From Mr Matt Andersson.
Sir, A much greater security risk than a fellow passenger at your elbow is the cargo packed below your posterior. If 
Michael O'Leary of Ryanair thinks that passenger screening is "farcical" ("Airlines in backlash over new travel 
restrictions", August 19), he should be as forthcoming about the tragic comedy that is air freight security.
At least one-third of this country's nearly 30bn tons of annual freight movement travels along with passengers under 
the "known shipper programme" in and out of the US. Unfortunately, this programme too is not meaningful in 
ensuring integrity of cargo shipments; moreover, what very small percentage of freight is randomly checked, the 
checking is done not by the Transportation Security Administration or any official security authority but by private 
"inspectors" from shipping or airline companies. While passengers are subjected to enormous security processing 
delays, a parallel movement of freight is speeding along outside the terminal to your aircraft, facing no such 
screening whatsoever.
Relatedly, non-passenger flight risk from external weaponry such as various portable rocket armaments is also 
effectively unaddressed and suffers as well from a lack of sufficiently developed counter-technology, and of course 
funding.
In all the noise and drama of profiling and carry-on rules, we would be wise to get serious about breaches arguably 
more real and much more easily exploited than the ones perceived to emanate from "high-risk" passengers. Where 
is the biggest security delay? The US Congress and UK Parliament.

After twice this summer enduring a grueling 14-hour car ride from a New York City suburb to Detroit, Michael 
Belsole couldn't believe his eyes when a Spirit Airlines online service he signed up for sent him an email advertising 
a round-trip flight for only $16.
Date availability was limited, but the deal which came to $35 after taxes and fees was too good to pass up. So Mr. 
Belsole and his wife, Angela, organized a visit with her brother and his grandchildren. "It was a nice family reunion," 
says Mr. Belsole, a 57-year-old computer-sales account manager from Mount Vernon, N.Y.
In recent years, airlines have been cutting back on discount programs for people over 50. But some travelers are 
fighting back with strategies of their own. Getting the best fares takes some savvy, and sometimes a strong 
stomach to gamble a bit by waiting for last-minute sales. For those willing to invest the time and energy, the Internet 
now offers a plethora of tools formerly available only to industry insiders.
"Seniors are the perfect candidates for flying cheaply because they have time flexibility and destination flexibility, 
which are the two ingredients for getting a good price," says Rick Seaney, chief executive of FareCompare.com, an 
airfare information Web site based in Dallas that was launched in March.
Here are some favorite strategies from road warriors and travel agents:
PICK THE CHEAPEST TRAVEL DAYS: Typically Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the least booked and 
consequently the least expensive days to travel within the U.S. You can typically save $20 to $40 on domestic 
flights compared with prime weekend times, says Liberty Travel Inc. consultant Al Vega.
European fares vary depending on the route, but are often somewhat less expensive on Monday through Thursday. 
And you're more likely to find a seat in the airport waiting area.
BUY TICKETS TO EUROPE IN DECEMBER FOR WINTER TRIPS: Airlines typically launch fare wars in December 
for travel from January through March. The peak purchasing season for winter and spring travel kicks off on Jan. 2, 
Mr. Seaney says. But, by then, many of the best fares are gone.
With senior discounts all but gone, here's how to find the best fares
Since the fare competition may be more intense for certain destinations, you can save even more by being flexible 
on where you land. For example, says Mr. Vega, you can often save by flying to London where fare competition is 
intense and hopping a low-cost European carrier such as Ryanair to your final destination.
WATCH LIKE A HAWK: New domestic fares from hundreds of airlines are released by fare-collection firm Airline 
Tariff Publishing Co. three times every weekday: at 10 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. On weekends, they come out 
once, at 5 p.m.
FareCompare says it makes new fares public within 10 minutes of their official release time. The truly obsessive 
can log on to FareCompare just after the posting times, check out what is available, and be among the first to snap 
up deals when they're posted on airline and travel sites, generally three to four hours later. You can't buy tickets on 
FareCompare itself.
If you use Firefox browser, a popular alternative to Microsoft's Internet Explorer, you can also sign up to get a 
beeping alert from FareCompare while you're online. The alert tells you when a fare to your selected destination 
dips below a level you've chosen.
DON'T PLAN TOO FAR IN ADVANCE: Older travelers often want to plan ahead getting to the airport three hours 
early and buying tickets six months ahead or more, Mr. Seaney says. He says the early-bird strategy is smart only 
when you must travel at a peak time, such as Christmas and Thanksgiving. Otherwise, "if you're buying outside of 
six months, you're overpaying," Mr. Seaney says.
Start looking at fares three or four months ahead, he says, but don't buy unless you see a deal. FareCompare gives 
historical seasonal fares for 77,000 city pairs in the U.S. and Canada and ranks them with stars up to four, which 
means "purchase it as quickly as possible."
At about a month to 90 days before travel, you should get serious about buying, but still hold out for a three-star or 
four-star fare. It's a game of chicken; if fares spike, you could miss a good deal. But more than likely, Mr. Seaney 
says, you'll pay less if you wait, watch and buy on a dip.
If you are flying from a small airport, where there is less fare competition, you might want to err on the side of 
caution. And make sure to buy before the cutoff point needed to get cheaper advance fares generally 14 or 21 days 
before the flight.
TRAVEL ON A LARK: If you don't mind packing your bags with only one or two weeks' notice, a package with 
airline and hotel fare can be a steal.
Ed Perkins, the 76-year-old founding editor of the now-defunct Consumer Reports Travel Letter, says that packages 
can be a great money-saver, but that you should beware of the bottom-priced hotel used by travel agents to post 
eye-catching price headlines since it may be poor quality. He recommends paying a little more for the next-most-
expensive hotel offered and even then checking its reputation with a guidebook or independent travel site.
STRATEGIZE YOUR OFF-SEASON PLANS: Pick your off-season bets carefully, says Mr. Perkins. Tickets are 
cheap to Scottsdale, Ariz., in July and August, he says, but "you open the door of your air-conditioned hotel room, 
and you think you've opened a furnace."
Mr. Perkins, now a semiretired online travel writer, says Europe is just as nice with a little rain and snow. "But if 
you're going to London, what you care about is the theater, not the weather," he says.
On FareCompare, the lowest available fare from Los Angles to Rome recently was logged at $573 for travel from 
November through March. But if you leave after April 1, you pay at least $809.
INVEST TIME IN LEARNING ARCANE CODE: If you enjoy a puzzle with your bargain hunting, it's now possible to 
get the same information travel agents have been getting for years.
With senior discounts all but gone, here's how to find the best fares
ExpertFlyer.com, for a basic monthly fee of $4.99 or a premium fee of $9.99 monthly, or $99.99 annually, offers an 
inside peek at airlines' actual seat inventories. This information, which ExpertFlyer buys from three major airline 
reservation systems, tells you how many seats are available in each "fare bucket," or class of fares on each flight. 
By learning the codes the airlines use, you can find which seats can be upgraded to a higher class with frequent-
flier miles. You can also get a rough idea (not exact, alas) of how many seats are open in each booking class on 
each flight. So if you see there are only two coach-class seats left for a flight you're considering, you'd better book 
fast. If a lot are left, you might be able to wait a few days and see if the fare drops.
You can't buy directly from ExpertFlyer, but "we tell you what's available, so when you go to the airline's Web site 
you know what you are looking for," says John Lopinto, co-founder of the Patchogue, N.Y., site.
One highly coveted fare that the site helps you find is coded with the letters YUP, which means you pay coach fare 
but immediately upgrade to first class. Y-up fares, as they're referred to in the industry (though their codes can also 
begin with QUP or KUP), are offered by airlines because they bring in paying customers for seats which might 
ordinarily have been given away free or nearly free as upgrades.
ExpertFlyer tells you exactly which airlines are offering the Y-up fares on the dates you want to travel and how 
much they cost compared with cheaper coach fares. You can find the same fares on individual airline sites and 
some popular travel sites, but multiple searches are generally required to find what ExpertFlyer shows you on just 
one screen.
Still, securing a Y-up can be a little tricky. Mr. Lopinto recommends you first check the price of Y-up fares on 
ExpertFlyer and find out which flights have first-class seats available. Then you go directly to the airline's Web site 
and select "first class with restrictions" or a similar term and choose the flights where you already know Y-up fares 
are offered.
SUBSCRIBE TO EMAIL ALERTS: Many airlines and online travel agents will send you email alerts about cheap 
fares. Mr. Belsole, who got the cut-rate fare to Detroit, subscribes to about 10. The hitch: You might be limited to a 
very few travel dates. Spirit Airlines offered only five dates for the New York-Detroit deal, and all but two were gone 
by the time Mr. Belsole logged on. Spirit says it sends its "crazy eight" deals and other specials to anyone who 
asks, but frequent fliers get them at least slightly before they are made publicly available.
SENIOR DISCOUNTS: While airline discount programs for seniors have been disappearing, a few such as at 
Southwest and United Airlines are still going strong.
But you have to know how to use them to get the best discounts. For example, says Mr. Perkins, United Airlines' 
Silver Wings Plus program, available to people age 55-plus, often offers the biggest savings to small, underserved 
airports such as his local airport of Medford, Ore. Preferred membership in the program, which costs $240 a year, 
offers fares sold on a "zone" system, in which you pay a flat fee based roughly on how far away you are traveling.
For example, fares for a fall trip from Medford to Boston recently ranged from $575 to a whopping $1,050, while the 
same trip leaving from Portland, Ore., would cost only $429 to $557. A Silver Wings "Preferred" member could fly 
from either Medford or Portland for $389 plus a $5 administrative fee.
Silver Wings Preferred members get $300 in "travel credits" a year, which can be used only in increments of $100 
for each ticket purchase but don't expire as long as you remain a member. And for procrastinators, a big plus: You 
can book travel at the last minute under zone fares for the same flat fee, as long as fares are still available.
Other discounts for airfares, hotels and theme parks are available on an AARP members-only travel site 
(http://www.travelocity.com/AARP/home). On the site, powered by Travelocity, the text is made larger and colors 
are chosen to be easy on the eyes, Travelocity says. Airline discounts are few, but Travelocity says it is negotiating 
to add more. For now, the AARP site offers discounts of as much as 5 percent on some United fares and will soon 
be offering additional discounts on Mexicana Airlines.

Shares on the Dublin market bounced back today, regaining most of Friday's losses, as news that CRH had 
completed its biggest ever acquisition offset early falls on Wall Street.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 20.14 points higher on 7781.83.
Volume however, remained seasonally low with only 15 million shares changing hands.
 Over on Wall Street, US stocks suffered a negative morning, with higher oil prices and a lack of economic or 
corporate excitement providing investors with an excuse to take profits after last week's gains, traders said. A report 
released in the US on Friday showed that consumer sentiment dropped more than expected in early August, 
registering its lowest reading since just after Hurricane Katrina. The data, combined with higher gasoline prices, 
have increased consumers' expectations for inflation, a potentially troubling sign for the Federal Reserve. CRH led 
the construction sector higher today after the buildings materials group confirmed that its US subsidiary, Oldcastle 
Materials, has bought Ashland Paving and Construction for USD1.3bn (E1.008bn) - its biggest ever acquisition. 
Shares in the company climbed 35c to 25.70. McInerney also traded in the black, up 15c to 1150, while Kingspan 
gained 5c to 1415. Elsewhere in the sector Grafton was up 5c to 1039 after the building firm was named by 
Goodbody Stockbrokers as a share "best placed to benefit from the Irish economy". With interest rates on the rise, 
Goodbody said investors tended to seek larger more liquid stocks with better defensive characteristics than small 
cap stocks. Goodbody also identified fruit company Fyffes and food group Greencore as stocks with "special 
situation" potential depending on the outcome of specific events. Shares in Fyffes jumped 1c to 147, while 
Greencore closed 2c higher on 405. Goodbody's Irish Small Caps Update report forecast that small cap stocks on 
the Irish Stock Exchange will do less well than larger firms. The broker said the key conclusion from the research 
was that the argument for small cap outperformance relative to larger caps may not be as compelling as it was in 
the past. Small cap valuations "appear less compelling" than larger caps, it said. Goodbody analyst Gavin Kelleher 
said investors should choose smaller cap stocks where there is a structural growth story at play. "The Irish smaller 
ISEQ jumps 20 points, buoyed by CRH
caps we identify as structural growth stories that, in our view, offer the best opportunity for outperformance are 
IAWS, Kingspan, Norkom and Paddy Power." The report appeared to have a minimal impact on the shares today, 
with IAWS slipping 24c to 1500, Paddy Power down 5c to 1370 and Norkom up 2c to 139. No-frills airline Ryanair 
fell 8c to 708 after it was confirmed that baggage handlers at Stansted airport plan to strike later this month over a 
pay dispute. Despite the threat of action, Ryanair said it will operate a full schedule to and from the airport even if 
the strike goes ahead. Other notable movers included Elan, up 16c to 1160, ICON, up 1.45 to 54.75 and C and C, 
up 3c to 888. Insurance group FBD Holdings was the days biggest faller, shedding 45c to 3955, while Kerry Group 
slipped 7c to 1681.

Body
Six days of travel chaos, warnings of lawsuits, a staffing crisis and the matter of providing the most intense level of 
security ever witnessed at Britain's main airports to counter terrorists' plans to blow up aircrafts in mid-air. It would 
be unreasonable to suggest Stephen Nelson has had better days as chief executive of the British Airports Authority. 
He was only appointed to the position on July 13.
He is a man used to facing up to challenging tasks. Three days prior to his appointment, this keen cyclist completed 
in nine hours the 187km L'Etape du Tour, one of the most exacting stages of the Tour de France. BAA's own 
gruelling journey of the last 10 days is far from over. Its press release last Thursday - a week after the police anti-
terrorist operation to foil the alleged liquid bomb plot led to chaotic scenes at Heathrow and BAA's six other UK 
airports - may have caused a corporate sigh of relief.
Service, it said, was back to levels similar to those prior to the imposition of increased security levels, which at one 
stage increased the ratio of body searches at Heathrow from one in four to one in one.
But Mr Nelson has had to bring in hundreds of volunteers from BAA's 11,000 workforce to support security staff. 
"It's a machine running very fast just to keep up," said one BAA insider. One of Mr Nelson's immediate priorities is 
to find a permanent solution to the temporary security staffing arrangements.
Then he has warring airlines to fend off. Mr Nelson was not inaccurate in describing the situation as "the biggest 
security crisis in aviation history in this country". But that did not prevent headlines such as "Utter chaos" after Willie 
Walsh, chief executive of BA, described Heathrow security "like a bad dream at Disneyland". Mr Walsh and Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, will not let this rest.
One national newspaper put Mr Nelson's claim that BAA staff had "coped magnificently" to a passenger queuing for 
hours in the rain outside Heathrow. "Magnificent? Is that a joke? It's just a total shambles," the passenger said.
Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at ABN Amro, said he believed the bricks being thrown at Mr Nelson were unfair. 
"BAA got criticised for not having a contingency plan but that would have meant a contingency to employ double the 
A man for turbulent times IN THE SPOTLIGHT STEPHEN NELSON
number of security staff. They would have been slaughtered by the regulator and the airlines for inefficiency," Mr 
Lobbenberg said.
Mr Nelson, a 43-year-old Oxford classics scholar, made his reputation in retail and consumer industries. He spent 
seven years at Diageo, mainly on Guinness-related projects, before rejoining J. Sainsbury as trading and marketing 
director. "He is very intelligent, thoughtful and puts himself out there," said a senior Sainsbury's insider. "He is not 
one to sit behind the desk."
He was brought in by BAA as retail director only last year to head the company's huge retail centre at the Pounds 
4.2bn Terminal 5. But Ferrovial's Pounds 10.1bn hostile takeover of BAA in March prompted the departure of Mike 
Clasper, the chief executive who led the company's failed defence of the bid. Ferrovial catapulted Mr Nelson into 
the top spot, though there is a view he was always seen by the Spanish owners as Mr Clasper's successor. Luis 
Sanchez Salmeron, a Ferrovial insider, is looking over Mr Nelson's shoulder as deputy chief executive.
Aside from managing the expectations of the Spanish owners, Mr Nelson has to deal with an Office of Fair Trading 
inquiry into the ownership and market structure of UK airports, the Civil Aviation Authority's five-year review into 
airport charges. He also has to renegotiate a bond and ensure T5 gets into operational readiness as well as submit 
a planning application for a replacement Terminal 2.
BAA insiders say Mr Nelson has the advantage of calling on an experienced management team that has, with the 
exception of Mr Clasper, stayed in place during the transition to new owners.
Where he might need to be more involved is with BAA's media profile, handicapped, say some, by having a 
multitude of spokespeople in the security crisis firefighting the very public complaints of passengers and airlines.
"He won't be particularly fazed by this. He won't be running round saying the sky's fallen in," said the Sainsbury's 
insider. "But I think he needs to have his head more above the trenches. There are some pretty vocal people out 
there."

Ryanair today confirmed that it expects to operate a full schedule of flights to and from Stansted airport next 
weekend even if the proposed strike goes ahead.
If the threatened strike proceeds, Ryanair will allow all passengers to use its web check-in facility and has written to 
those passengers today to advise them that if the strike goes ahead, then they may be required to web check-in 
and travel with no checked in luggage on those flights.
"Ryanair hopes that the strike will not proceed as it is not in the interests of the Swissport workers (who earn double 
time for working a bank holiday weekends) or the travelling public who should not be held to ransom by the GMB 
over the course of a bank holiday weekend," a statement from the Irish low-cost carrier said.
 "Ryanair believes that the GMB and Swissport should sort out their differences without trying to blackmail the 
travelling public, however any strike if it proceeds will not be allowed to disrupt Ryanair's flights at Stansted next 
weekend."

Body
Controversial Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary, has been accused of boasting that he is making money out of the 
airport terror crisis in the UK.
The airline chief has made frequent TV appearances attacking the British Government's security clampdown at 
airports and allegedly told an official at the Transport Department: 'Every time I appear on TV I get a spike in sales.'
Mr O'Leary, who has clashed with Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander, last night denounced the claim as 
'preposterous' and denied having made the remark.
 And he stepped up his war of words with the Government by claiming there was no proof that any plot to blow up 
airliners had ever existed. Mr O'Leary caused protests last week by invoking the spirit of Winston Churchill to revive 
airline sales following the terror scare. Ryanair adverts in UK national newspapers featured a photo of Churchill 
making his famous V for Victory sign under the heading Let's Beat Terrorism, with a balloon from the wartime 
leader's mouth which declared: 'Keep Britain Flying.' Below, it offered '1 million seats at Â£25 - book today on 
Ryanair'.

While Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has raged - with justification - about new security restrictions on passengers, 
airlines and pilots at the UK's main airports, European Business Jets has reaped the benefits.
The Aim-listed private jets operator has had its phone "going non-stop" since the security alerts and subsequent 
restrictions hit Britain's largest airports. Its business model is 'fractional ownership' of small Cessna Citation CJ1 
twin-engine planes - a plan similar to that of Netjets, owned by US investor Warren Buffett.
It promises part-owners they can fly anywhere in Europe with 12 hours' notice. By using airports such as Biggin Hill 
and Cambridge, passengers can avoid some of the hassle affecting fellow executives.
It is now close to getting an aircraft operators' certificate to allow it to operate other private jets.

A week after Britain said it had foiled a terrorist plot to blow up US-bound aircraft, the authorities face a backlash 
against a confusing array of security restrictions that have baffled passengers, upset pilots and drawn legal threats 
from one airline.
The world's busiest airports are now mostly free of the grim queues and cancelled flights that afflicted thousands of 
travellers last weekend, but there is no sign of a change to safety measures that Michael O'Leary, chief executive of 
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, yesterday described as "farcical" and "Keystone Cops-like".
Terrorists "must be rolling around the caves in Pakistan laughing at us", he said, as he threatened to sue the 
government for Pounds 2m in compensation unless normal service resumes within seven days.
"We are not in danger of dying at the hands of toiletries," he added.
However, the Department for Transport said it had no immediate plans to end the requirements introduced since 
last week's terror alert for everyone boarding an aircraft in Britain, including pilots and airline stewards.
The measures include searches of every second passenger and no cabin luggage larger than 45cm x 35cm x 
16cm.
US-bound passengers are also banned from taking cosmetics, toiletries, liquids or drinks on board aircraft.
The British Airline Pilots Association said it was "illogical and frankly bizarre" to stop pilots taking aboard toothpaste 
or contact lens fluid, given that they carried thousands of litres of fuel on each flight.
Adding to the woes of travellers, baggage handlers at Stansted airport plan to strike over the bank holiday next 
weekend because of a pay dispute.
Airlines in backlash over travel restrictions *Confusion across Europe over new security rules
Meanwhile, travellers outside Britain face a range of restrictions that appear to vary according to destination and 
airline.
In Germany, Fraport - the operating company for Frankfurt, continental Europe's largest airport - said the new hand 
luggage restrictions only applied to US-bound flights and those operated by US airlines.
But in Spain, the airports authority AENA said that restrictions applied to flights to the UK, the US and Puerto Rico. 
Iberia, the national carrier, was also putting them on flights to Argentina. Flights to all other destinations are 
unaffected.
Italy and France banned liquids on flights to the UK, the US and Israel. Italy also has the same hand luggage ban 
as the UK but Air France does not.
The luggage size restriction does not apply to passengers using US airports either, including those flying to the UK.
A spokesman for Britain's Department for Transport said he knew of no plans to co-ordinate security measures 
internationally.
The lack of consistency has caused confusion at many large companies. RBS, the Edinburgh-based banking group, 
said it had advised staff to cancel all non-essential travel.
"Other companies must have done the same thing," a spokesman said. "We have also seen more use of video-
conferencing."

The Conservatives are considering a radical overhaul of transport policy in an attempt to embrace "the principles of 
eco-taxation", according to Steve Norris, the former minister charged with reforming the party's manifesto on the 
subject.
The party needs to re-examine its reputation as the "motorist's friend," said Mr Norris, the former transport minister 
who is leading the Tories' transport working party. He is also proposing that the Conservatives should put an 
increased levy on short-haul air travel, arguing that the "polluter" should pay for refusing to make short or medium 
length international journeys by rail.
Between 1975 and 2004 there was an 11 per cent drop in real terms in motoring costs; a 60 per cent rise in bus 
fares; and a 70 per cent rise in train fares, Mr Norris said.
"That's absolutely wrong. What eco-taxation needs to do is fundamentally (to) address the gap simply by removing 
the distortion in the marketplace at the moment, which doesn't internalise the real costs to the environment of 
emissions," he said in an interview with The Guardian.
On motoring policy, Mr Norris suggested the Tories need to move away from their long-standing reputation for 
being "the provisional wing of the Automobile Association".
Mr Norris also suggested that air passenger duty could be graded to charge more for the first 500km, with costs 
tapering after that. "Under 500km, we should really be looking at making those journeys by high-speed rail."
Referring to the owners of Ryanair and EasyJet, he said: "Mr O'Leary won't like this, Sir Stelios won't like this, but 
every environmentalist will regard this as absolutely essential. You do have to avoid creating a culture based on 
cheap aviation which will be as pernicious as the way of life based on car ownership has been in terms of urban 
planning. We've now got a generation living in France, working three days a week here, (which) thinks nothingof 
going to Prague fora stag night."

All-frills airline and charter services receive a boost from terror alert

The airborne terror alert that crippled Britain's major airports has proved to be an unexpected boon for all-frills 
airlines and charter services shuttling from Britain to the United States and Europe.
While budget and mainstream airlines counted their losses and pondered who to sue for the loss of business 
Friday, high-end and charter carriers tallied up the number of new customers since the alert on Aug. 10.
"When the bigger system is under stress and is breaking down, we are continuing to deliver," said David Spurlock, 
the founder of Eos Airlines, a business-class only trans-Atlantic carrier.
Business travelers in particular have been attracted to luxury carriers that fly out of smaller British airports avoiding 
long security lines at the major terminals and that offer planes with onboard services that many mainstream airlines 
cannot rival.
Those services have had the phones running hot at both business-only scheduled carriers and charter airlines.
Eos Airlines, which began operating once-daily flights between London's Stansted Airport and New York's John F. 
Kennedy Airport in mid-October, reported a 32 percent increase in bookings for next week.
MAXjet Airways, which offers a rival service on the same route, said it has seen a 30 percent rise in average weekly 
ticket sales over the past five days.
"There are a lot of people switching, people are obviously feeling more comfortable to fly on a private jet than on a 
commercial carrier," said Spurlock, formerly a director of strategy at British Airways.
The trans-Atlantic route was the target of an alleged plot to blow up as many as 10 aircraft with liquid explosives 
that was revealed by the government on Aug. 10, sparking tough new security regulations that banned all hand 
luggage and increased passenger searches.
British Airways PLC, Virgin Atlantic, Continental Airlines and other major carriers canceled hundreds of flights 
following the alert and airports are still struggling to get back to normal operations.
All-frills airline and charter services receive a boost from terror alert
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC threatened Friday to take legal action against the government if it does not 
improve matters at airports, while British Airways has already raised the possibility of suing the British Airports 
Authority for compensation.
In contrast, Spurlock said Eos canceled no flights and operated with an average delay of just 15 minutes during the 
crisis.
The security level has since been eased and passengers are now allowed to take a small amount of hand luggage, 
but several liquid items are still banned.
Eos Airlines is providing its passengers with several items they can no longer carry onboard, including saline 
solution and contact lens holders. It is also currently offering an escort service that greets each arriving passenger 
at the airport to assist with any necessary baggage repacking, and to escort the guest individually through check-in 
and fast-track security procedures.
MAXjet CEO Gary Rogliano said that the airline's passengers benefited from a fast track security checkpoint at 
Stansted, "which significantly reduces waiting times."
The phenomenon is not restricted to airlines operating out of London or the trans-Atlantic route.

long-term option to transport executives," Newtown said.

taken aback by the cost.
"They're learning a lesson in economics. When you buy a plane ticket, you're paying for a part of the flight," she 
said. "But when you charter a flight, you're paying for all of it."

Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC threatened to take legal action against the British government unless it meets 
three demands for relaxing airport security and improving staffing at overstretched airports within the next seven 
days.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the carrier has sent a letter to Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander 
informing him of its demands.
The airline, which canceled scores of flights and suffered a 10 percent drop in weekly bookings because of the 
terror alert that raised security levels on Aug. 10, wants the government to return passenger search requirements to 
pre-alert levels.
It also wants the government to restore the hand luggage allowance for passengers leaving British airports and an 
assurance that military and police personnel would be released to help with airport security checks next time there 
is a major security alert.
O'Leary declined to say how much compensation the airline would seek from the government, but said the alert had 
so far cost the carrier "a couple of million" euros in canceled flights and lost bookings.
He rejected analyst forecasts that Ryanair faced a â¬10 million hit, saying the short-term cost was likely to be "a 
couple of million euros" and the long-term impact would be immaterial.
"If the security procedures are returned to normal within another seven days, then Ryanair will not make any claim 
against the government," he added.
The government initially banned all hand luggage on flights out of Britain after it announced on Aug. 10 that it had 
thwarted a plan to blow up as many as 10 trans-Atlantic flights. It has since eased that ban, but some restrictions 
remain.

O'Leary was particularly critical of the fact that passengers may now carry a large briefcase, but not a small 
wheeled case, which he claimed was just 20 percent larger than the allowed briefcase.
The issue is a problem for Ryanair because the carrier began charging customers in January for each bag they 
checked as part of a plan to get passengers to take only what they could carry.
The airline temporarily waived its â¬2.50 ($3US.20) fee for each carry-on bag that unexpectedly had to be checked, 
but has since reintroduced it. O'Leary said Monday that the airline had no plans to end the policy.

All-frills airline and charter services receive a boost from terror alert

Body
The airborne terror alert that crippled Britain's major airports has proved to be an unexpected boon for all-frills 
airlines and charter services shuttling from Britain to the United States and Europe.
While budget and mainstream airlines counted their losses and pondered who to sue for the loss of business 
Friday, high-end and charter carriers tallied up the number of new customers since the alert on Aug. 10.
"When the bigger system is under stress and is breaking down, we are continuing to deliver," said David Spurlock, 
the founder of Eos Airlines, a business-class only trans-Atlantic carrier.
Business travelers in particular have been attracted to luxury carriers that fly out of smaller British airports avoiding 
long security lines at the major terminals and that offer planes with onboard services that many mainstream airlines 
cannot rival.
New airlines running the premium service London-New York shuttle at a discounted price believe they can 
capitalize on the current increased interest and win long-term customers.
Eos Airlines, which began operating once-daily flights between London's Stansted Airport and New York's John F. 
Kennedy Airport in mid-October, reported a 32 percent increase in bookings for next week.
MAXjet Airways, which began a rival service on the same route also last year, said it has seen a 30 percent rise in 
average weekly ticket sales over the past five days.
"There are a lot of people switching, people are obviously feeling more comfortable to fly on a private jet than on a 
commercial carrier," said Spurlock, formerly a director of strategy at British Airways.
The trans-Atlantic route was the target of an alleged plot to blow up as many as 10 aircraft with liquid explosives 
that was revealed by the government on Aug. 10, sparking tough new security regulations that banned all hand 
luggage and increased passenger searches.
All-frills airline and charter services receive a boost from terror alert
British Airways PLC, Virgin Atlantic, Continental Airlines and other major carriers canceled hundreds of flights 
following the alert and airports are still struggling to get back to normal operations.
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC threatened Friday to take legal action against the government if it does not 
improve matters at airports, while British Airways has already raised the possibility of suing the British Airports 
Authority for compensation.
In contrast, Spurlock said Eos canceled no flights and operated with an average delay of just 15 minutes during the 
crisis. Airlines like Eos and MAXjet have the advantage of using separate private jet terminals at the airport.
The security level has since been eased and passengers are now allowed to take a small amount of hand luggage, 
but several liquid items are still banned.
Eos Airlines is providing its passengers with several items they can no longer carry onboard, including saline 
solution and contact lens holders. It is also currently offering an escort service that greets each arriving passenger 
at the airport to assist with any necessary baggage repacking, and to escort the guest individually through check-in 
and fast-track security procedures.
Unlike the standard Boeing 757s, Eos' jets are fitted with just 48 seats on a plane that typically carries 180. MAXjet 
puts around 102 seats on a plane that typically carries more than 200, with the same legroom as standard business 
class on American and Continental Airlines.
MAXjet CEO Gary Rogliano said that the airline's passengers benefited from a fast track security checkpoint at 
Stansted, "which significantly reduces waiting times."
And while flexibility is not always on offer Eos and MAXjet have limited flight schedules they do have a cost 
advantage. Eos, for example, offers flexible round-trip fares for $5,200, compared to the $7,900 flexible business 
class fare or $12,600 flexible first class fare available on BA's website.
The phenomenon is not restricted to airlines operating out of London or the trans-Atlantic route.
AD Aviation, which runs a private air charter service out of Liverpool John Lennon Airport in the north of England, 
reported a 50 percent increase in British and European travel inquiries and bookings.
AD Aviation CEO Mike Newtown said that business travelers in particular were constrained by the security 
measures on a mainstream scheduled flight.

environment where meetings can even be conducted in flight," Newtown said.

long-term option to transport executives," Newtown said.
However, Executive Beechcraft's Allen wasn't convinced, saying prospective new passengers were sometimes

Charges for a full charter service vary depending on the size and style of the plane Executive Beechcraft's run from 
just under $1,000 an hour to $3,400 an hour.
"They're learning a lesson in economics. When you buy a plane ticket, you're paying for a part of the flight," she 
said. "But when you charter a flight, you're paying for all of it."

No- frills airline Ryanair is to issue the UK government a seven-day ultimatum over airport security measures.
The airline today said it would be writing to the UK government to demand 'immediate restoration' of security 
measures at Britain's airports to 'normal international standards'.
Ryanair said it had confirmed to the Secretary of State for Transport that if the government restored security at 
Britain's airports to normal levels within the next seven days then it will not make any claim for compensation, which 
it said it was entitled to do under UK law.
 Ryanair also said it was attempting to restore customer confidence in flying by releasing 1 million seats for sale on 
over 100 routes from the UK to Europe for travel during August and September at prices of Â£25.00 one-way Ryanair 
today said that releasing cheap seats is a way to get Britain flying again and after last weeks terrorist alert in 
Heathrow airport. Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said. "The best way to defeat terrorists and extremists 
is for ordinary people to continue to live their lives as normal. Because of the additional security restrictions 
imposed by the Government last Thursday, the shambles at the London airports has been anything but normal."

The UK Department for Transport today turned down an ultimatum by Ryanair's saying that they have no intention 
of compromising security levels or changing their requirements in the next seven days.
This comes after the low cost airline said that it would be issuing the UK government with a seven-day ultimatum 
over airport security measures today.
Ryanair said it had confirmed to the Secretary of State for Transport that if the government restored security at 
Britain's airports to normal levels within the next seven days then it will not make any claim for compensation, which 
it said it was entitled to do under UK law.
 A spokesman for the UK's Department for Transport challenged Ryanair's claim that it was entitled to 
compensation under UK law, saying the airline was basing its claim on the wrong Act of Parliament. 'The security 
regime in place at UK airports is necessary because of the level of security threat and is kept under constant 
review,' he said. 'We have no intention of compromising security levels nor do we anticipate changing our 
requirements in the next seven days. At a press conference in London today, Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O'Leary accused the UK government of 'inaction and stupidity' over the way it had handled last week's terrorist 
threat, which he said left over 100,000 passengers stranded at Britain's airports and resulted in 1,000 cancelled 
flights.

7,761.69.
Body
The Dublin shares market closed off a week of modest but steady gains with a fall in stock prices this evening as 
profit takers pocketed what little gains there were. 
The ISEQ took on 150 points in total in the past week though volumes were notably low as the market treaded 
water in the traditional holiday month.
While there was little to spur share buying through the week, there was also little to scare investors into selling 
either.
 Economic releases both at home and abroad were mostly benign as oil prices fell by up to USD4 a barrel in the 
wake of the Lebanese cease fire and the apparent success in UK authorities in preventing what could have turned 
out to be a major catastrophe. However, talk has been building of a possible slump in the US economy setting in by 
the end of this year, a scenario that was refuted today by several Irish economists. Mergers and acquisitions news 
gave some flavour to today's trading. Shares in outsourcing services group, Newcourt, climbed 2c to 1.22 after 
Newcourt's shareholders approved its acquisition of the Irish AIM-listed company, Ely Properties. Newcourt is 
paying E22.3 million for Ely, a property management business that specialises in student accommodation and has 
plans to open creches. The purchase gives Newcourt a foothold into the student accommodation, childcare and 
private healthcare markets. In comments at the EGM, management reiterated its previous guidance that the 
company would complete a further three or four deals by the end of the year, which follows on from the seven 
announced so far this year. Meanwhile, the financial sector put in a mixed performance. AIB closed 10c weaker at 
20.20, Bank of Ireland was down 8c at 14.72. Anglo Irish Bank was up 6c to 12.06 and Irish Life and Permanent 
dropped 12c to 19.13. Shares in the construction sector were up with the exception of CRH, which was down 26c to 
25.33. Kingspan climbed 18c to 14.10 along with McInerney, which was up 5c to 11.35. Grafton rose 11c 10.34. 
Elsewhere, Irish pharmaceutical company Elan was down 11c to 11.4 and no- frills airline, Ryanair, dropped 8c to

7.16. Dolmen Securities today reported Michael O'Leary has said that the increased airport security measures in 
London over the past week have not had a big financial impact on Ryanair. O'Leary said the short-term financial 
impact of the past week's cancellations and delays might total "a couple of million euros." and "over the longer term, 
it's an immaterial impact." Ryanair, nevertheless, intends to sue the UK government. Last weekend, Ryanair 
experienced a drop of roughly 10pc in bookings, but that rebounded quickly. Other notable movers included 
bookmaker Paddy Power. Shares in the Belfast-based broadcaster UTV rose by 3.75pc yesterday after it confirmed 
it had made a merger approach to its Scottish counterpart SMG. UTV shares were trading 12p up at 332 in London.

Air Berlin to take over budget rival DBA TRANSPORT

Body
Air Berlin, Europe's third-largest budget airline, is stepping up consolidation in the sector by taking over DBA, a 
German rival, previously owned by BA.
The surprise announcement yesterday which helped push Air Berlin's shares 10.6 per cent higher to Euros 10.99, 
highlighted the pace of change in the tough German market and intensified the competitive threat facing Lufthansa, 
the German flag carrier.
Air Berlin, which had 13.5m passengers last year and has a reputation in Germany as an aggressive upstart, eager 
to take on rivals such as Ryanair and Easyjet, expected to have 20m passengers together with DBA. No sale price 
was given but Joachim Hunold, Air Berlin's chief executive, described the net price agreed for DBA as in the "mid-
two-digit millions" of euros. He stressed the attraction of DBA's slots in Munich and Dusseldorf.
The financial market reaction was a fillip for Air Berlin, which in May had been forced to scale back its flotation amid 
investor scepticism about the outlook for the sector.
BA disposed of DBA in 2003 for a symbolic Euros 1 (Dollars 1.30). Deutsche BA had lost money every year since 
its creation in 1992.
The buyer then was an investment group headed by Hans Rudolf Wohrl, a Bavarian businessman who also had 
interests in retail clothing and property.
Air Berlin yesterday said DBA's performance had improved significantly. A Euros 66m loss in 2003-04 had been cut 
to Euros 30m in the 2005-06 financial year and DBA had notched up a profit in the first quarter of its current 
financial year.
Mr Wohrl had also been able to justify his investment, said one person close to yesterday's sale. "You can assume 
that it was profitable for him."

Lufthansa reacted by saying it had expected consolidation in the sector. "We've faced competition before and 
competition will remain stiff," said a spokesman.
Analysts also played down the immediate impact on the flag carrier. "We . . . would not overestimate the financial 
consequences for Lufthansa," Sal Oppenheim said in a research note.

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, will today give details of legal action against the UK Government over losses incurred 
through the new anti-terror airport regulations.
An initiative 'to keep Britain flying' is also set to be launched by chief executive, Michael O'Leary.
O'Leary, whose airline has had to cancel dozens of flights at the height of the security crisis, has been highly critical 
of the new baggage rules, describing them as 'nonsensical'.
 It is believed that Ryanair has been trying to get other airlines to join in the fight for compensation. Ryanair has 
been particularly critical of airport operator BAA's arrangements at Stansted, accusing the company of not having 
enough staff on duty. The airline's website said: 'We continue to call on the UK Government to lead the process of 
returning normality to London's airports by addressing the root causes of the problems.'

British Airways and easyJet have both denied a report in The Times that they and other airlines, including Ryanair 
Holdings, are planning to sue the UK government for up to Â£300 million to recover losses incurred since extra 
security measures were imposed after last Thursday's terror alert.
The newspaper claimed the airlines are hoping the threat of legal action will force the government to lift the 
restrictions on hand luggage, which have caused thousands of flight cancellations and delayed millions of 
passengers since as alleged terrorist plot to blow-up planes flying between Britain and the US was foiled.
The Times quoted an e-mail it obtained that was sent by Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's head of regulatory affairs, to 
leading airlines outlining the case for compensation and encouraging them to take action.
 'No consideration has been given or is being given to suing the UK government,' said a spokeswoman for the UK 
carrier. She confirmed BA will, however, seek compensation from BAA, the operator of seven UK airports, including 
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. BAA is now owned by a consortium led by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA. A 
spokesman for easyJet also dismissed The Times report. 'Any suggestion that easyJet is considering suing the UK 
government for any losses incurred as a result of the additional security measures imposed last week is wildly and 
deliberately inaccurate,' he said. 'The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens and easyJet commends 
the UK government for acting decisively last week.' However, the spokesman did note that the situation of the last 
few days has highlighted the 'absurd and immoral' obligation of airlines to provide hotel accommodation for 
passengers when flights are cancelled for reasons wholly outside of their control. 'This is something we will be 
urging the UK government to take up at EU level -- but that is for another day.'

Shares on the Dublin market made modest gains today after tame US inflation data and falling crude oil prices. 
At the close, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 34.05 to 7792.02. 
Crude-oil prices dropped more than a dollar a barrel as traders responded to a report of above-average US oil

 The fall in oil prices had a positive effect on the Dublin market as it would reduce the energy costs of companies,

Body
Airlines operating out of the UK, including Ryanair and British Airways, will sue the British government for up to 
Â£300m in lost earnings stemming from extra security measures imposed last week, according to a report in the 
Times.
The airlines hope the threat of a legal action will force the government to drop hand luggage restrictions, which 
have seen hundreds of flights cancelled since an alleged terror plot was foiled last week, said the paper.
Ryanair has been vocal in its condemnation of the handling of the crisis by the UK government and called for an 
urgent review of security measures.

Foiled terror plot sparks debate about profiling passengers in Britain

As airport security tightens, checkpoint lines grow and tempers fray amid fears of devastating airborne attacks, 
more and more Britons are calling for the use of profiling to decide which travelers should be singled out as possible 
threats.
Advocates say it's common sense: elderly women and families with young children pose little risk. Opponents argue 
it's an ineffective policy which will alienate Muslims and in the words of a senior police officer create an offense of 
"traveling whilst Asian."
"Any measures introduced have got to be intelligence-led and not beard-led," said Shahid Malik, a lawmaker with 
the governing Labour Party.
Security at British airports was radically tightened last week after authorities said they had foiled a plot to blow up 
U.S.-bound jetliners using liquid explosives.
In the immediate aftermath, onboard liquids and hand luggage were banned and passengers endured long delays 
as security staff conducted hand searches of every traveler. That requirement has been eased, but the number 
remains far higher than the roughly one in four passengers searched before last week.
The Department for Transport now says that for the foreseeable future, most passengers will be searched.
Aviation security expert Chris Yates of Jane's Information Group said that with airports' current technology focused 
on screening checked baggage for bombs and passengers for guns or knives "you cannot check every single 
person for explosives. The airports would just grind to a halt."
The gridlock seen at Heathrow and other British airports this week has prompted more people to call for profiling to 
select passengers for searching.
Michael O'Leary, CEO of budget carrier Ryanair, said it was pointless "to be body-searching young children 
traveling with their parents on holiday to Spain. These are not terrorists."
Foiled terror plot sparks debate about profiling passengers in Britain
Former Metropolitan Police chief Lord Stevens argued in the News of the World newspaper that "Islamic terrorism 
in the West has been universally carried out by young Muslims ... almost always traveling alone or in very small 
groups."
Racial and behavioral profiling has made Israel's El Al arguably the safest airline in the world, but the policy is 
controversial elsewhere. In the United States, civil libertarians have objected to profiling programs introduced at 
U.S. airports which look for suspicious patterns of behavior.
Experts say an element of profiling already exists at British airports. Security staff covertly scan passengers looking 
for those who appear nervous or behave oddly.
Advocates of such behavioral profiling say it should be vastly expanded, arguing it is a vital tool that avoids 
stereotyping passengers by ethnicity or religion.
"You are looking for abnormal behaviors, and they will be different on any flight," said Philip Baum, editor of Aviation 
Security International and an adviser on airline security.
He cites the example of Anne Marie Murphy, identified as an anomaly by Israeli profiling at Heathrow Airport in 
1986 because she was a pregnant young Irishwoman, traveling alone to Tel Aviv. When searched, she was found 
to be carrying a bomb in her handbag, placed there by her Jordanian boyfriend.
"We should practice positive profiling you look for those people who pose an extremely low threat, for example 
people who look like a family, act like a family and interact with the outside world like a family," Baum said.
"You cannot say, 'let's pull aside all Asian males.' That would be wrong, and it would not be good security sense."
But Muslim leaders fear profiling will inevitably mean more Muslims are searched, alienating a community that 
already feels it has borne the brunt of police stop-and-search tactics since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United 
States.
"What you are suggesting is that we should have a new offense in this country called 'traveling whilst Asian,'" said 
Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent Ali Dizaei.
"That's unpalatable to everyone. It is communities that defeat terrorism, and what we don't want to do is actually 
alienate the very communities who are going to help us catch terrorists," Dizaei told British Broadcasting Corp. 
television.
Dizaei argued that terrorists "come in all shapes and sizes."
Richard Reid, the would-be shoe bomber apprehended aboard a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001, was a mixed-race 
convert to Islam. Three of those arrested in the airplane plot were also converts.
"Muslims are not an ethnic group and come from many different backgrounds including from the black community 
and increasingly from the white community," said Inayat Bunglawala, spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain.
"There is concern that such profiling would perhaps only contribute to further alienating a group whose close 
cooperation is essential in countering terror."

Ryanair considers legal action over ' Disney ' measures

Ryanair, the low-cost airline, is considering legal action against the government for what it terms Walt Disney-style 
security measures.
Ministers have told BAA, the airports operator, that they do not envisage fundamental changes to the stringent 
security regime put in place at British airports this week. Airport security staff are body searching every second 
passenger rather than the one in four before last Thursday's alerts, and carry-on baggage has been limited to one 
small cabin bag per person.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, accused the government of introducing Walt Disney security 
measures, adding: "We should go back to the same provisions we had before Thursday. They were perfectly 
efficient."
Mr O'Leary said his lawyers were exploring available options, but he did not provide details on how action could be 
brought against the government.
His comments highlight concerns that low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet have most to lose from new 
airport procedures. The budget airline business model relies heavily on cost-cutting measures such as making 
passengers pay to check in luggage.
The comments from Mr O'Leary, who had also called for troops to be used to clear backlogs on body searches, 
shifts some of the blame for the chaos of the past week away from BAA.
British Airways has threatened to seek compensation from BAA for losses since the alert, estimated at Pounds 50m 
by some analysts. It believes the airport group was not properly prepared for the crisis and did not provide adequate 
staff cover for body searches.
But BAA said yesterday that while it regretted the disruption it believed the allegations "are neither fair nor 
accurate". It said Heathrow was significantly overstretched and pointed to the disruption caused by last year's 
Ryanair considers legal action over ' Disney ' measures
industrial dispute at Gate Gourmet, BA's in-flight caterer. It also warned that the new security measures would 
inevitably lead to higher costs for itself and the airlines.
"The current security regime, which we must assume will be maintained for the foreseeable future, will require us to 
bring in additional staff across our airports.
"Since 9/11 wehave added roughly 1,500 security guards to our security team, which currently comprises 6,000 
people. The only alternative to increasing security resource is to accept a reduced passenger throughput capacity 
atour airports."
Other airlines want to discuss compensation, but said the first priority was a return to normal service. Virgin Atlantic 
suggested yesterday the government should consider covering part of the bill.
But the Department for Transport said there was no question either of government compensation for airlines or BAA 
or for government funding for new security measures. "It has always been made clear that the industry pays its 
security costs," it said.
However, the US government has helped to pay for stricter security measures at US airports.
BAA executives believe much of the criticism,led by BA, is aimed at influencing an investigation by the Office of Fair 
Trading into the dominant position of BAA in running London's airports.

Mudlark normally is no fan either of Ryanair or of wheeled carry-on bags when used by any able-bodied person 
under 60.
But the current shambles at British airports may lead to a Damascene conversion, at least concerning Ryanair.
Suddenly Michael O'Leary seems like the most reasonable voice around.
Consider the airline's attack on "nonsensical and ineffective" security rules: "Under the new measures, a large 
briefcase can now be carried on board as hand luggage but not the normal carry on 'wheelie bag', which is only 25 
per cent larger. What security 'expert' decided that a large briefcase was safe as hand luggage but the normal 
carry-on wheelie bag isn't? This rule is a nonsense."
Who could put it better?

Europeans have become used to cheap flights, sometimes paying no more than the price of a good meal for a 
ticket between London and Barcelona.
But last week's terrorist alert has cast a shadow over the era of budget flying, with fears that no-frills airlines won't 
be able to avoid passing on to their customers the costs of tougher long-term security measures.
"The situation as it is at the moment is unsustainable," David Bryon, an industry consultant and former managing 
director of low-cost airline bmibaby, said Monday.
Canceled and delayed flights since Thursday, when authorities revealed a plot to attack several trans-Atlantic 
flights, have already cost all carriers millions of pounds (dollars; euros) per day. Budget airlines could be even more 
susceptible to future costs.
That is because the no-frills carriers are particularly vulnerable to increases in "turnaround times" the interval 
between when a plane's wheels hit the tarmac and when it takes off again with a new set of passengers.
Speedy turnaround times mean more flights and reflect the budget airlines' decision not to offer full onboard meals 
and to discourage passengers from checking bags costly services that eat up time and staff on the ground. Fast 
groundwork is a primary way that the no-frills carriers keep down costs and fares.
Ryanair Holdings PLC prides itself on a turnaround time of 25 minutes, while its major competitor easyJet PLC aims 
for just five minutes more. But with passengers stuck in lengthy queues at airports around the country because of 
strict security checks, those numbers are currently far out of reach.
"The problem is that the budget airlines work to tight schedules," said Bryon. "If you can't physically do that because 
of passenger checks, you can't meet your turnaround timetable, you have to consider changing your schedule and 
costs rise."
Terror threats spell trouble for cheap travel
The government slightly eased strict security measures that had banned all carry-on baggage as the threat level 
was lowered Monday. The Transport Department said passengers would be allowed to carry a single, briefcase-
sized bag aboard planes, and that books, laptop computers and digital music players would be permitted again.
But BAA PLC, the operator of Heathrow and other major London airports that has struggled to deal with the chaos, 
said it would not adopt the relaxed regime until Tuesday. It also ordered airlines to cut Monday's services by 20 
percent or face the loss of all their flight slots, drawing complaints from airlines.
Bmibaby Chief Executive Nigel Turner said the airline was following BAA's directive but he hoped the situation 
would have returned to "pretty much as normal" by the end of the day.
EasyJet, which has canceled more than 500 flights since Thursday, continued to ask its passengers Monday to still 
pack everything into one piece of luggage for the hold in an attempt to minimize the volume of bags it has to deal 
with.
Ryanair, which has grounded a fifth of all scheduled departures since Thursday, was harshly critical of both the 
BAA and the government.
"The U.K. government, by insisting on these heavy handed security measures, is allowing the extremists to achieve 
many of their objectives," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
Ryanair is particularly sensitive to restrictions on hand luggage after it this year began charging customers for each 
bag they checked as part of a plan to get passengers to take only what they could carry.
The airline temporarily waived its â¬2.50 (US$3.20) fee for each carry-on bag that unexpectedly had to be checked, 
but said Monday that it had no plans to ditch the policy.
David Learmount of Flight International magazine said that stance was unsustainable in the long term as some form 
of more intense security checks were likely to remain in force.
Ryanair said the recent delays and cancelations were unlikely to affect its forecast for the number of passengers it 
expects to carry over the financial year because it bases the outlook on the number of tickets booked, rather than 
the actual number of passengers carried.
However, the airline declined to comment on whether the situation would hurt its full-year profit guidance. Ryanair 
expects net profit over the year to be up 5 percent to 10 percent on the â¬301.5 million it made last year.
Learmount said budget airlines might be able to make some money going forward from increased sales onboard if 
restrictions remained on purchases of duty-free goods before boarding.
Bryon, however, said that any new restrictions on sales of goods like bottles of alcohol would likely apply to onboard 
sales as well as at gate-side shops, restricting the abilities of low-cost airlines to spread the extra costs unlike full-
cost airlines that can leverage the cost over a wider base.
"I don't think we will be able to go back to those days of relaxed onboard baggage, which means things will have to 
change," he said.

Airlines begin to count cost of terror alert and question who should pay

As the immediate security threat at British airports wanes, airlines are beginning to count the multimillion dollar cost 
of the terrorist alert and consider who should pay.
British Airways PLC on Tuesday led a growing campaign against the British Airports Authority, which many carriers 
claim was ill-prepared for the emergency that led to hundreds of canceled or delayed flights.
A joint compensation claim against BAA, which operates seven airports around Britain including London's 
Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick, could run as high as 300 million pounds ($570 million), based on analyst 
estimates of the airlines' daily losses.
Airlines say BAA was too slow to respond when the government imposed strict security checks on all passengers 
and a ban on onboard baggage last week after the discovery of a plot to blow up several airplanes on the trans-
Atlantic route.
The alert crippled airport operations on Thursday and BAA has struggled to get flight schedules back to normal 
since then.
Analysts estimate that the crisis could be costing British airlines a combined 50 million pounds ($95 million) a day, 
putting the total costs at 300 million pounds ($570 million) by the end of Tuesday.
BAA, which was recently acquired by Spanish construction giant Ferrovial SA for 10 billion pounds ($19 billion), 
called accusations that it lacked adequate plans "neither fair nor accurate."
It pointed out that Heathrow, where much of the criticism has been leveled, was designed to cater to a maximum of 
55 million passengers per year, but is currently handling 68 million.
"The fact is that Heathrow, the world's busiest international airport, is at the best of times significantly overstretched 
because of the difficulties over many years of securing permission to grow capacity at the airport," BAA said in a 
statement. "The scale and suddenness of the measures imposed last week could not be managed without 
significant disruption."
Airlines begin to count cost of terror alert and question who should pay
The airports operator kept bans on hand luggage in place for an extra day after the government eased the security 
threat level Monday. In a bid to ease congestion, it also ordered all airlines to cut the number of their departures by 
between 20 percent and 30 percent each day since the alert, with the threat of losing all their flight slots if they did 
not.
BAA lifted that requirement Tuesday but British Airways again canceled 20 percent of its flights and said there 
would be more cancellations Wednesday, blaming the scrapped flights on BAA's inability to cope.
The airline said it was actively considering whether to pursue BAA for compensation.
"Since 9/11, everyone in the industry has known there might be times when extra security measures needed to be 
put in place," British Airways Chief Executive Willie Walsh told the Daily Mirror newspaper. "Yet when the moment 
struck, BAA had no plan ready to keep the airport functioning."
Budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC also canceled more flights Tuesday from Stansted, its key London airport.
"This morning, we had a situation where, despite assurances to the contrary, the staff were not in place," said 
Ryanair spokesman Peter Sherrard. "An hour before scheduled flights, there were still only half the 14 security 
points open."
Ryanair, which said it has seen a 10 percent dropoff in bookings since Thursday, said it was considering legal 
action against the government in order to reduce security screening delays at airports. It said it would consider 
compensation after it dealt with the current logistical issues.
It said the current restrictions, which still bar any liquids from being taken through security points, should be 
reviewed or alternatively police or army personnel should be deployed to speed up the screening of passengers.
Virgin Atlantic Airways said it was considering all options and was prepared to discuss compensation with BAA.
"Airlines have incurred substantial costs in the past few days, collectively running into millions of pounds and clearly 
we need to consider all the options for possible contributions to these costs, whether it be possible rebates, 
compensation or government support," it said in a statement.
However, no-frills carrier easyJet PLC said it had no plans to join in any attempt to sue BAA for compensation. 
Spokeswoman Samantha Day said BAA had dealt with the crisis as best as it could and the industry was better off 
discussing how to cope with future alerts.
BAA said it was working on the assumption that the current security regime would be maintained for the 
foreseeable future and it had begun working on bringing in additional staff and strengthening its security system.
The airport operator said it had added about 1,500 security guards to its security team since the Sept. 11, 2001, 
attacks, bringing the total to 6,000.
BAA owns and operates airports that handle 63 percent of travelers to and from Britain a figure that rises to 86 
percent in Scotland and to 92 percent in London.
Britain's competition watchdog is considering a detailed inquiry into the domestic airport market and whether BAA's 
dominance delivers the best value for air travelers.
A full probe by the Competition Commission, which was mooted in the middle of the takeover battle for the airports 
operator in May, could complicate any bid from airlines for compensation.

Ryanair has described the British government's revised security measures as 'nonsensical and ineffective' and said 
delays and cancellations will continue.
It noted that twice the number of passengers passing through the x-ray security machines in British airports must 
now be searched.
'If the government wants to double the number of security checks, it must provide the extra staffing (army or police 
personnel) to allow the London airports to carry out these checks without causing mass delays and cancellations,' it 
said.
 Ryanair today said that at 04.00 this morning, BAA Stansted had opened just 4 out of 14 security points at the 
airport. Passengers had already been checking in for one hour at that point. At 05.00 this morning, just one-hour 
prior to the scheduled first wave of departures, BAA Stansted had opened just 7 out of 14 security points. UK 
travellers are enduring a sixth day of disruption and delays at UK airports despite yesterday's relaxation by the 
government of restrictions on airline hand baggage. BAA, which owns seven UK airports including Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted, stressed that although the nation's security level has been downgraded to 'severe' from 
'critical' strict security remains in place in the wake of last Thursday's foiling of an alleged plot to blow-up planes 
flying between Britain and the US by police. 'Delays are likely, and anyone travelling over the next few days is 
asked to allow extra time for their journey and to arrive at the airport prepared,' it said in a statement. Passengers 
are now permitted to carry one item of cabin baggage through the airport security search point. However, the 
allowance (45 cm by 35 cm by 16 cm) is less than half the size they were able to take on board before last 
Thursday's alert. Some items, such as liquids and aerosols, remain prohibited. Extra restrictions remain in place for 
flights from the UK to the US. British Airways PLC anticipates cancelling about 20 pct of its flights operating out of 
Heathrow. It plans to operate a full longhaul schedule from Gatwick but 11 domestic flights have been cancelled. It 
also cautioned that flights that are running remain subject to delays. A spokeswoman for the UK flag carrier said it is

Insurance stocks put in an impressive performance in Europe yesterday after a couple of brokers turned more 
positive on the sector following recent strongsecond quarter results.
Citigroup upgraded its stance on the sector from "neutral" to "positive", saying the market undervalued the likely 
free capital generated since IFRS accounting standards were adopted.
"The market is implicitly assuming that surplus cash will be wasted on value-destructive M&A. We think this is too 
harsh," said James Quin, a strategist.
The broker named Germany's Allianz, France's Axa and Zurich Financial as its top picks in the sector.
Deutsche Bank named the same three as its favoured insurance stocks, but focused on Allianz. Deutsche, like 
Citigroup, was impressed by potential cash returns, saying "ongoing earnings momentum supports dividend 
capacity".
Allianz gained 1.2 per cent to Euros 130.09, while Axa added 1.6 per cent to Euros 28.55 and Zurich Financial 
climbed1.5 per cent to SFr282.00.
Other insurers were lifted by improving broker sentiment. Munich Re was up1.4 per cent to Euros 115.65 and Swiss 
Re moved 2 per cent higher to SFr93.00.
Lehman Brothers noted that returning cash to shareholders was becoming more prevalent outside the financial 
sectors. "With dividends and buybacks on the rise, capital expenditure is declining as a proportion of total cash 
use," said Ryan Kloster, an analyst.
Ahold was one of yesterday's biggest gainers amid speculation about cash returns to shareholders after two hedge 
funds put pressure on the Dutch retailer to break up. Centaurus Capital and Paulson & Co, who jointly own 6.4 per 
cent of Ahold, said: "Ahold has a lot of separate entities with few synergies."
Broker sentiment lifts insurers EUROPE
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,343.55, helped by weaker oil prices following a ceasefire in the 
conflict between Israel and Hizbollah.
Although oil prices fell, there was some good news for the energy sector after BP announced it was keeping the 
western half of its Prudhoe Bay oilfield on line while work was carried out on the damaged pipeline.
Austria's OMV gained1.1 per cent to Euros 45.40 while France's Total added 0.7 per cent to Euros 53.05.
European airline stocks received a boost as the UK lowered its security alert and lifted some of the restrictions on 
passengers at UK airports in the wake of last week's discovery of an alleged plot to bomb transatlantic flights.
Lufthansa gained 2 per cent to Euros 14.52 while Air France-KLM climbed 1.8 per cent to Euros 19.60.
But Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, fell 1.2 per cent to Euros 7.150, after it complained that airport operator BAA 
needed to do more to clear the backlog of flights.

British Airways is "seriously considering" demanding compensation from BAA, the airports operator, as a result of 
the chaos that followed last week's security alert, estimated to have cost the airline Pounds 50m.
Over the weekend Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, blamed BAA for being unable to cope with the in-creased 
security and baggage checks imposed after the discovery of an alleged plot to blow up a number of US-bound 
aircraft.
Andrew Fitchie, aviation analyst at Collins Stewart, the broker, said yesterday: "It is quite clear that BAA was the 
bottleneck over recent days that caused many passengers to miss their flights. It was the first time I've ever seen 
the chief executive of British Airways complain publicly about BAA's performance."
Collins Stewart estimates the cost to BA is Pounds 50m so far, and increasing by Pounds 5m a day, although BA 
cautioned that it had not made its own assessment. The broker estimated that the cost to EasyJet, the budget 
airline, had reached Pounds 10m.
The strongest criticism from the airlines has been reserved for BAA's shortage of security staff to carry out searches 
of passengers.
The airport operator said: "None of this is anyone's fault, these are exceptional circumstances. No one foresaw this 
and there is only a certain amount you can do within contingency plans.
"We would have needed the new Terminal 5 (scheduled to open in 2008) to have coped with this. And we would 
have needed an extra 50 per cent of security staff sitting off in a building somewhere on the off-chance something 
might happen."
Heathrow was designed to cope with 40m passengers a year but 68m use the airport.
Stephen Nelson, BAA's chief executive, said the situation was "the biggest security crisis in aviation history in this 
country".
BAA could face compensation demand AIRPORT CHAOS
The crisis has come at a sensitive time for BAA. The company's future, including its ownership of UK airports and 
the next round of price-capping by the airports regulator, is under review. Ferrovial, the Spanish construction, 
infrastructure and services group, paid Pounds 10.1bn to acquire BAA in June. Only days after the deal was 
revealed, the Office of Fair Trading announced an investigation into the UK airports market that could lead to a 
demand for the eventual break-up of BAA's dominance of London's airports. Airlines such as BA and Ryanair could 
support a break-up as a way to drive down costs. Some BAA executives believe much of the weekend mud-slinging 
was aimed at showing the airport group in a poor light.
Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at ABN Amro in London, said: "I'm a bit cynical about the airlines throwing 
bricks at BAA.
"They are trying to deflect any blame for delays from themselves and position themselves for the row about who 
pays for the new security measures going forward. Ultimately, it will be the airlines, and their customers, who will 
need to pay for this."
BAA and the airlines are not yet able to determine the cost of new security measures. But under an agreement with 
the Civil Aviation Authority, the air travel regulator, BAA can pass three-quarters of the costs of any increased 
security to the airlines, once they go above a Pounds 14m threshold at Heathrow, Pounds 6m at Gatwick and 
Pounds 3m at Stansted.
Yesterday's relaxation of security measures will go some way to easing concerns about the appetite for business 
travel, the most profitable part of the aviation business. But worries about any extra burden will weigh on airlines.

is a primary way no-frills carriers keep their costs and fares lean.
Ryanair Holdings PLC prides itself on a turnaround time of 25 minutes, while its major competitor easyJet PLC aims 
for just five minutes more. But with passengers stuck in lengthy queues at airports around the country because of 
strict security checks, those numbers are currently far out of reach.
"The problem is that the budget airlines work to tight schedules," said Bryon. "If you can't physically do that because 
of passenger checks, you can't meet your turnaround timetable, you have to consider changing your schedule and 
costs rise."
Terror threats spell trouble for cheap travel
The government slightly eased strict security measures that had banned all carry-on baggage as the threat level 
was lowered Monday. The Transport Department said passengers would be allowed to carry a single, briefcase-
sized bag aboard planes, and that books, laptop computers and digital music players would be permitted again.
But BAA PLC, the operator of Heathrow and other major London airports, said it would not adopt the relaxed regime 
until Tuesday. It also ordered airlines to cut Monday's services by 20 percent or face the loss of all their flight slots, 
drawing complaints from airlines.
BAA has struggled to deal with the chaos and been roundly criticized by Ryanair and British Airways over its 
handling of the security threats.
Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, said the airline was ready, willing and able to fly its planes, but blamed BAA's 
slow-going approach for the delays.
"BAA is unable to provide a robust security search process and baggage operation at London Heathrow, and as a 
result we are being forced to cancel flights and operate some others from Heathrow without all the passengers 
onboard," he said.
Bmibaby Chief Executive Nigel Turner said the airline was following BAA's directive but he hoped the situation 
would have returned to "pretty much as normal" by late Monday.
EasyJet, which has canceled more than 500 flights since Thursday, continued to ask its passengers Monday to still 
pack everything into one piece of checked luggage in an attempt to minimize the volume of bags it has to deal with.
Ryanair, which has grounded a fifth of all scheduled departures since Thursday, was harshly critical of both the 
BAA and the government.
"The U.K. government, by insisting on these heavy handed security measures, is allowing the extremists to achieve 
many of their objectives," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said.
Ryanair is particularly sensitive to restrictions on hand luggage. In January it began charging customers for each 
bag they checked as part of a plan to get passengers to take only what they could carry.
The airline temporarily waived its 2.50 euro ($3.20) fee for each carry-on bag that unexpectedly had to be checked, 
but said Monday it has no plans to ditch the policy.
David Learmount of Flight International magazine said that stance was unsustainable in the long term as some form 
of more intense security checks were likely to remain in force.
Ryanair said the recent delays and cancelations were unlikely to affect its forecast for the number of passengers it 
expects to carry over the financial year because it bases the outlook on the number of tickets booked, rather than 
the actual number of passengers carried.
However, the airline declined to comment on whether the situation would hurt its full-year profit guidance. Ryanair 
expects net profit over the year to be up 5 percent to 10 percent over the 301.5 million euros it made last year.
Learmount said budget airlines might be able to make some money going forward from increased sales onboard if 
restrictions remained on purchases of duty-free goods before boarding.
Bryon, however, said that any new restrictions on sales of goods like bottles of alcohol would likely apply to onboard 
sales as well as at gate-side shops, restricting the abilities of low-cost airlines to spread the extra costs unlike full-
cost airlines that can leverage the cost over a wider base.
"I don't think we will be able to go back to those days of relaxed onboard baggage, which means things will have to 
change," he said.

Highlight: Dublin shares followed global markets higher today, with the ISEQ ending 45 points ahead this evening.
Body
The Dublin market made modest gains today as investors looked for guidance to London and New York, which both 
rebounded following the easing of worry over last week's terrorist plot to blow up US bound aircraft and as the 
Israeli/Lebanon ceasefire began.
The net effect of the two events was to send crude oil prices sharply lower on the world market, thus easing - for the 
time being - a major burden on equity markets worried about the inflationary effects of surging energy costs.
All eyes will be on the US this week as inflation data is released with Irish and world investors hoping for some let-
up in inflationary pressures.
 At home, there were few buyers around to give the market a kick-start as holiday trading kept volumes low. 
Ryanair, a major faller last week after the foiled terror attack in the UK, saw its stocks languish in the red again amid 
growing worries that security restrictions at British airports, though relaxed somewhat, will continue to affect 
operations at some of its biggest European hubs. Earlier today the no-frills airline has called for the immediate 
introduction of scanners at Dublin Airport. Shares closed 9c lower at 715. Dolmen Securities today issued its 
Strategy Review for the year for its clients, giving Adidas its top stock status out of a pick of twelve with Grafton 
heading its top Irish stock to watch at number six and Ryanair at number ten. Dolmen has forecast the ISEQ to rise 
to 8,500 by the end of the year with a target upside of 15pc earnings from its portfolio of Irish and international 
stocks. The report stressed that the recent decline in Irish and world equities has been futures led and not earnings 
related, meaning that external market forces rather than the inherent value of stocks has had a major downward 
pull of late. Meanwhile, banking shares led the ISEQ forward yesterday with AIB shares up 27c to 1982, Anglo Irish 
gained 9c to 1145, Bank of Ireland jumped 24c to 1439 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 15c to 1905. Dolmen 
has a target price E15 for Bank of Ireland stocks, citing its impressive array of earnings and profit numbers at its 
half yearly interim report earlier and gains in loan growth. Among the builders, Grafton shares were up 6c to 1026 
amid more data - this time from Ulster Bank's PMI index - showing no let-up in activity in the construction sector. 
ISEQ closes 45 points higher at 7,640
Dolmen points out that the company is realising increasing cash amounts from its property sites and that the market 
in the UK is showing marked signs of an improvement. Elsewhere in the sector, CRH shares dropped 6c to 2531 on 
profit taking and McInerney rose 11c to 1091. Shares in Independent News and Media edged up 1c to 230 after 
Independent News & Media is to acquire a 20pc stake in Shri Puran Multimedia, a company which owns eight 
licences to operate radio stations in India. Shri Puran Multimedia is a sister company of Jagran Prakashan, the 
listed Indian newspaper group of which INM already owns a 20pc stake in.

 Low-cost airlines expected to be hit hardest

Low-cost airlines could be harder hit by increased security procedures than long-haul carriers, industry ex-perts 
warned yesterday.
Companies such as Ryanair and EasyJet rely on cost-cutting measures, such as making passengers pay to check 
in suitcases so that they take their luggage on board themselves.
If these have to be abandoned over the long term it will make the budget airline business model less viable, 
according to Chris Tarry, an independent airline industry analyst at Ctaira.
"We will see less efficiency in the low-cost airline business model," he said.
Budget airlines are already compromising their stringent limits on passenger baggage to help people to get through 
check-in faster. EasyJet has increased its luggage allowance from 20kg to 25kg, for instance.
A big risk for budget airlines is that people choose other forms of transport for journeys across Europe.
Mr Tarry said: "You may see a natural switch to the train because people cannot stand building in an extra hour into 
their journeytime to get through theairport."
Eurostar, which runs high-speed trains between London, Paris and Brussels, said Thursday's disruption at airports 
led to an extra 5,500 bookings, with all seatssold on the London to Paris route.
Industry experts estimated that the disruption over the past few days could cost long-haul and low-cost airlines as 
much as Pounds 10m each.
The immediate cost is likely to differ between the airlines because some of the budget carriers do not fly out of the 
London airports, where the worst of the disruption has been felt.
Flybe, for instance, which uses airports in Birmingham, Belfast, Southampton, Exeter, Glasgow, Guernsey and 
Norwich, was running a full schedule yesterday with 98 per cent of its flights on time.
 Low-cost airlines expected to be hit hardest
British Airways on the other hand scrapped 256 flights yesterday, an inc-rease from the 101 it cancelled on 
Saturday. This was in spite of the support of 400 additional BA staff, who volunteered to come into work yesterday 
to help reduce queues at the airports.
Airline bosses expressed increasing frustration with the government and BAA, the airport operator, as analysts 
began to count the cost of delayed and cancelled flights.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, which scrapped 20 per cent of its flights out of Stansted over the 
weekend, said the overloaded security situation had to be fixed and vowed to return to a full flight schedule today.
Willie Walsh, BA's chief executive, blamed BAA for being unable to cope with the increased security and baggage 
checks.
The security clampdown has created another summer of misery for BA, which last year was hit by unofficial strike 
action by 1,000 ground services staff in support of dismissed workers at Gate Gourmet, the airline's catering 
supplier. That dispute ended up costing BA about Pounds 40m.

Bomb plot link to al-Qaeda 'likely'

Body
Security officials in the UK and Pakistan yesterday said intelligence was pointing to a likely link between al-Qaeda 
and the alleged plot to bomb commercial airlines en route from London's Heathrow airport to the US.
As the UK continued to remain on the highest "critical" level of terrorism alert, Pakistan's investigation of the plot 
was concentrating on an al-Qaeda group based near Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, which officialssaid had 
actively backed the plot.
The security operation continued to cause severe disruption yesterday at the UK's main airports - Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted - with extensive flight cancellations and delays for the fourth day running.
John Reid, home secretary, admitted that the new security checks amounted to a "terribly inconvenient regime" that 
was "not indefinitely sustainable".
He is said to have raised the issue of lengthy checks by the US of passenger lists with the Department of Homeland 
Security.
But Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA, which cancelled 256 flights yesterday, more than double the number it axed 
on Saturday, blamed BAA, the airports operator, for being unable to cope with the increased security.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost operator Ryanair, attributed the delays to government-ordered body 
searches for all passengers and called for them to be scaled back.
BAA asked most airline operators to cut 30 per cent of their capacity to help it clear a backlog of passengers.
Among a group arrested in Pakistan in connection with last Thursday's anti-terrorist operation in the UK are some 
who were given plans by the al-Qaeda group for manufacturing explosives, a Pakistan official said.
Bomb plot link to al-Qaeda 'likely'
"The plans were handed over to these people and they then passed on the plans to contacts in the UK. The cell in 
Afghanistan played an active role through the provision of details on how the operation had to be carried out while 
the actual implementation was being done at the UK end," he said.
Pakistan officials examining the case also revealed details of a money trail linking accounts in the UK and Pakistan, 
and including groups in the UK dedicated to Islamic charities and small businesses suspected of being fronts for 
militants.
UK officials said there was a likely strong link between al-Qaeda and the alleged bombing plot, although the exact 
nature continued to be investigated.
The officials added that MI5 had identified at least 20 plots that could be activated relatively soon and there were 
dozens of others that appeared to be less advanced.

Holidaymakers and business travellers will today face further disruption to their plans as more flights from Heathrow 
are cancelled.
Just under a third of flights were scrapped yesterday after BAA, the airports operator, asked carriers to cut the 
number of departures to help it cope with the backlog of passengers and heightened security arrangements.
BAA said the decision had been taken because the problem of passengers facing long and uncertain waits for 
flights and the resultant overcrowding was "not sustainable". "We proactively made this decision to make sure that 
the airline carriers could contact passengers and inform them of the situation," BAA said.
The cuts in yesterday's service came after 30 per cent of flights were cancelled on Saturday. The airlines taking the 
brunt of the changes are the larger carriers, as airlines operating two or fewer flights a day are exempt from the 
cuts.
There will be more reductions today as BAA struggles to cope with processing passengers under the tightened 
measures that require body searches of all passengers.
But, BA, which yesterday cancelled 30 per cent of its Heathrow flights, said it would be cutting just 20 per cent of its 
short-haul flights today, as it saw "some im-provement" at Heathrow. A total of 163 short-haul BA flights out of the 
normal 202 are expected to leave Heathrow, alongside 71 out of 76 long-haul flights.
The other main London airports, with the exception of City, reported disruption yesterday. At Gatwick, BA cancelled 
all 26 of its domestic fights and EasyJet nine. There were 38 cancellations at Stansted. BA said it would not run 
domestic flights today from Gatwick.
Most regional airports reported a return to normal yesterday. Birmingham said that it had not cancelled flights since 
Thursday. Manchester, Blackpool, Southampton and Liverpool John Lennon reported no cancellations and near 
normal delay times.
Regions back to normal as London hubs bear brunt of disruption
The mixed picture was reflected in the experience of carriers. One of the hardest hit was Ryanair, which yesterday 
cancelled 31 flights from Stansted.
BMI, which operates more than 170 flights a day, said it had largely recovered. It was expecting to cancel only three 
flights today. Virgin cancelled four flights from Heathrow yesterday and was waiting for instructions from BAA to see 
if it would have to cut services today.

Body
The downgrading of the threat from terrorism and the lifting of the ban on hand luggage on flights came after 
mounting pressure on ministers to deploy troops to speed up checks or to relax stringent security measures 
imposed on airline passengers after a fourth day of chaos at London's airports.
The controls, which in-cluded a body search for every passenger and a ban on hand luggage, were introduced on 
Thursday as police foiled an alleged plot to blow up several aircraft en route to the US.
Airlines and BAA - the operator of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports - joined MPs to urge the government to 
intervene to alleviate delays and extensive cancellations, with 200 flights cut on Sunday from Heathrow's schedule 
alone.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, called on the government to drop a requirement for every air 
passenger to be body searched - the main cause of a fourth day of delays and cancellations.
"We believe that the body search requirement can and should be revised from 100 per cent to the normal 25 per 
cent of passengers without in any way diminishing airport security," Mr O'Leary said. "If we don't get back to 
normality as soon as possible we're going to hand these extremists an unbelievable PR success."
Denis MacShane, a former minister caught up in the disruption over the weekend, urged the government to "get a 
grip" and send in the army, describing the situation at Heathrow as "reeking of third world chaos and 
disorganisation".
David Davis, shadow home secretary, also called for troops to be deployed, saying BAA "are clearly not up for this 
level of scrutiny".
John Reid, home secretary, conceded that the "terribly inconvenient regime" was "not indefinitely sustainable".
Mr Reid is understood to have persuaded the US Department of Homeland Security to speed up its checks on 
passenger lists which until yesterday had further delayed transatlantic flights.
Threat reduced after days of chaos AIRLINE SECURITY
As queues of frustrated passengers continued to snake around Heathrow, airport sources confirmed that "central 
search" - the security screens that separate check-in from the departure lounges - had become the main bottleneck. 
All passengers are subject to pat-down searches after passing through a metal detector and are required to remove 
their shoes for inspection.
BAA said the capacity of the central search areas was the limiting factor. Stansted, for example, had only 14 
security gates and although most of them were double-manned delays were extensive. "The workload has 
effectively magnified four times (because of body searches) and that is unprecedented," said BAA.
The scanning of hold luggage was adding to delays. The requirement for passengers to store in their hold luggage 
many electronic items normally carried by hand was making screening more difficult and time-consuming.
Early today the Home Office announced that the threat to the UK posed by terrorism was downgraded from critical 
to severe.
A statement on how this will affect air travel was expected this morning.

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, has called on the UK government to ease security measures at its airports and to bring 
in police to process passengers.
Ryanair called the new measures 'heavy handed' and said the UK airports were 'close to collapse'.
The low fares airline cancelled 20pc of flights from its London Stansted base over the weekend as airport managers 
tightened security after British police thwarted what they said was a plot to blow up transatlantic airliners.
 Ryanair's call was part of a growing row between carriers and the British Airports Authority over how to handle 
tougher security, which includes body searches and a ban on most hand luggage. British Airways cancelled 30pc of 
its flights from London's Heathrow airport yesterday. 'Ryanair supports all sensible and effective security measures 
which protect the safety of the travelling public and the UK's air transport industry,' Ryanair said in a statement. 
'However the BAA are unable to carry out body searches on 100pc of passengers who have just passed through 
security x-ray machines and this level of body searches does not enhance security,' the statement added.

Airlines canceled almost a third of flights from Britain's busiest airport Sunday, plunging travelers into a fourth day of 
travel chaos triggered by the foiling of an alleged airplanes bombing plot.
Many passengers were also missing their flights because they were stuck in lengthy security lines, prompting 
airlines to ask the government to bring in police to speed up the security checks.
British Airways scrapped 30 percent of flights from London's Heathrow Airport on the instructions of the airport 
operator British Airports Authority, or BAA.
The airport operator said 70 percent of flights on all airlines at Heathrow were expected to operate, but warned that 
tough new screening measures for passengers and luggage meant delays were inevitable.
BAA's chief executive for Heathrow, Tony Douglas, said the airport was doing its best, but that delays "will go on 
until the security threat level is reduced."
Home Secretary John Reid acknowledged that the security measures would have to be altered.
"The present regime is time limited," Reid told British Broadcasting Corp. television. "We know it is not indefinitely 
sustainable."
In the wake of the foiled plot to bomb as many as 10 airplanes over the Atlantic Ocean, authorities introduced tough 
new security measures, including individual searches of all passengers and a ban on carry-on luggage except clear 
plastic bags containing travel documents and a few essential items.
Reid said Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander had asked U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to 
ease the restrictions imposed by the United States, which include a ban on passengers carrying liquids aboard 
flights.
Nearly 1/3 of Heathrow flights canceled, airlines blame airport operator for delays
On Sunday, British Airways canceled almost 100 flights to Europe from Heathrow and scrapped all its domestic 
flights from London's second airport, Gatwick. Most long-haul flights were operating, although 10 BA flights to the 
United States were canceled.
Scores of flights from Britain to Europe and the United States also were canceled Saturday. Passengers were 
delayed so long by the strict new security measures that many missed their flights.
British Airways said it "cannot rule out the possibility that flights will once again depart without all their passengers 
because of ongoing problems with BAA's security search process and baggage operation at Heathrow Airport."
Some airlines accused BAA which operates seven of the country's major airports of failing to cope with tough new 
anti-terror security requirements.
"The airport's baggage system cannot process all of the passengers' bags and where passengers have been able 
to check their bags in, the lengthy queues in the airport security search area means that passengers are unable to 
get to the departure gate in time," BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh said.
Budget carrier Ryanair appealed to the British government to use police and army reservists to speed up searches 
at overloaded airport security checkpoints.
Ryanair, which has its British base at Stansted Airport, northeast of London, said it had complied with BAA orders to 
cancel more than 60 of its Stansted flights this weekend, about 20 percent of the total, but said this overloaded 
security situation must be fixed by Monday.
"Ryanair and other major U.K. airlines cannot keep canceling flights and disrupting the travel plans of tens of 
thousands of British passengers and visitors solely because the BAA cannot cope with the new body-search 
requirements," chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
"If the British government is serious about defeating terrorism and not allowing the terrorists to disrupt normal, 
everyday British life, then it must provide the additional security staffing."

European equities fell this week, hit by concerns over international terrorism and a renewed debate over global 
interest rates after the US Federal Reserve halted its monetary tightening for the first time in two years.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 1.1 per cent lower on the week at 1,331.1.
The biggest falls were earnings-driven. Securitas, the Swedish provider of security services, endured a weekly fall 
of 14.9 per cent to SKr117 after Thomas Berglund, chief executive, quit following a more than 50 per cent slump in 
second quarter net income. There was was also disappointment that the company had failed to find a buyer for 
Loomis, its cash handling business, and was instead embarking on a demerger next year.
Telecom stocks were knocked after Deutsche Telekom warned on profits and slashed its 2006 and 2007 targets as 
competition stifled growth in its domestic markets.
UBS downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "buy", while Citigroup was among several brokers lowering their price 
targets, dropping its to Euros 11.50 from Euros 13.50.
Deutsche's shares fell11.5 per cent over the week to Euros 10.84, while France Telecom fell 4.8 per cent to Euros 
15.73.
A mixed week for financial stocks left Commerzbank down 10 per cent at Euros 25.60. Like many of its European 
rivals, profits at its investment banking division surged as financial markets flourished, but business loan margins - a 
division the company has made central to its growth strategy - were disappointing.
Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch banking group, rose 2.8 per cent to Euros 29.25 after JPMorgan raised its price target on 
the stock to Euros 34.50 from Euros 32.30 in reaction to the company's 33 per cent rise in second quarter net profit.
AGF, the French insurer, rose 2.2 per cent to Euros 96.80 after first-half net profit climbed 33 per cent. Allianz, 
which owns 58 per cent of AGF, rose 0.5 per cent to Euros 128.60.
Securitas slumps as chief heads for the exit EUROPE
Celesio was one of the week's biggest climbers, up 7.8 per cent to Euros 40.03, after the German drugs wholesaler 
reported strong second quarter gains in its pharmaceuticals business. This prompted WestLB to upgrade its price 
target on the company to Euros 40 from Euros 39 and retain its "add" rating.
Stocks most geared to the threat of terror attacks on the airline industry were hit following Thursday's events at 
Heathrow airport. Grupo Ferrovial, which is buying BAA, the company that runs Heathrow and Gatwick, fell6 per 
cent to Euros 60.65. Ryanair fell 4.5 per cent to Euros 7.24 and Lufthansa slid 3.8 per cent to Euros 14.24.
EADS, the European aerospace group, was down4.1 per cent over the week to Euros 22.50 on fears that any 
subsequent fall in passenger traffic could have a knock-on effect on aircraft orders.
German steelmaker and engineer ThyssenKrupp fell 7.7 per cent yesterday, down 6.6 per cent over the week to 
Euros 26.10, after outlining expansion plans in North America, which include the purchase of Dofasco, the 
Canadian steel manufacturer.

Heathrow airport remained heavily congested yesterday and passengers faced continued delays and flight 
cancellations as airlines attempted a return to more normal schedules.
British Airways was hoping to operate about 70 per cent of shorthaul and domestic flights in and out of Heathrow.
BA was also facing more flight cancellations than expected of long-haul flights from Heathrow and Gatwick.
Tony Douglas, managing director of Heathrow for BAA, the airport operator, said: "Terminal buildings are extremely 
busy and passengers should still expect delays. Our advice is for anyone intending to travel to check the status of 
their flight with the airline before leaving home."
European airlines cancelled more than 1,100 flights and about 400,000 passengers experienced disruptions on 
Thursday after reports of the foiled terror plot, with most delays at Heathrow.
It is the fourth August in a row that passengers have had to cope with severe disruption at the world's busiest 
international airport, after previous summers were hit by incidents of industrial action and technical problems for BA.
Any problems at Heathrow are particularly pronounced because it already works at full capacity.
Severe disruption is expected through the weekend. BA usually carries 100,000 people a day out of Heathrow and 
Gatwick airports.
EasyJet, the budget carrier, scrapped 112 flights from Gatwick, Stansted and Luton to various destinations in 
Scotland and across Europe.
About 800 EasyJet flights did take off and the company promised to return to business as usual by today. Ryanair, 
Europe's largest low-fare carrier, cancelled 46 services out of Stansted.
Airlines try to catch up despite disruption fears
Eurostar, which runs high-speed trains between London, Paris and Brussels, said that Thursday's disruption at 
airports led to an extra 5,500 bookings, with all seats sold on the London to Paris route. Yesterday, it carried an 
extra 1,100 passengers.
Insurers may also end up paying out as claims on the cost of non-recoverable travel and accommodation can be 
made if flights are delayed for more than 24 hours under the terms of many policies.
Norwich Union, the UK's biggest insurer, said: "If you have been sitting at Heathrow for more than 24 hours and you 
just can't wait anymore and want to cancel your trip, we'll cover it."
Some insurers have amended policies to allow valuable items, such as laptops, to remained covered even if they 
are stored in cargo.

Britain's flight schedules slowly returned to normal Friday, a day after fears of a major terrorist plot to blow up U.S.-
bound planes caused massive disruptions.
A number of long-haul flights were canceled or delayed Friday, though many shorter flights resumed from Heathrow 
and other British airports, aviation officials said.
"The airport has returned to normal business," said Tony Douglas, the British Airports Authority official in charge of 
Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport. He said there were still delays, but most airlines were hoping to operate full 
schedules.
Transport Secretary Douglas Alexander reassured frustrated passengers that "the heightened level of security will 
last only as long as the situation demands, and is kept under constant review."
Airports canceled hundreds of flights Thursday after police said they foiled a plot to blow up as many as 10 jets. 
Airlines banned passengers from carrying hand luggage after reports that terrorists were planning to use common 
electronic devices to detonate liquid explosives concealed in sports drink bottles.
A spokeswoman for Heathrow said around 70 percent of flights were running, lines were shrinking and the situation 
was much calmer.
Earlier, many passengers turned around and headed home after an early morning announcement that a raft of 
flights had been canceled, including British Airways services to San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Most of Heathrow's inbound flights were arriving on time, but flights from the United States which increased security 
measures in the wake of the threat were heavily delayed.
In Paris, two airport security unions maintained their call for a strike over a wage dispute Friday, a day after France 
introduced stricter security at airports and train stations. A third union called off the strike because of the terrorist 
threat, and a spokesman for Aeroports de Paris, which operates the airports, said few workers were participating in 
the walkout.
Air travelers face further disruption at British airports in wake of terror threat
France has announced searches of all hand luggage on flights heading to the U.S., Britain and Israel, and Air 
France said it would ban all liquid products from carry-on baggage on flights to the U.S.
At London's Paddington rail station, the start of the line for express trains to Heathrow, police with dogs trained to 
find explosives patrolled the platforms.
"I quite understand all the checks. I know why they have got to do it," said Elaine Loman, who hoped to catch a 
flight from Heathrow to Barcelona, Spain.
At London's Stansted Airport, staff said they had canceled 59 flights on budget carriers easyJet and Ryanair. But 
many flights operated as scheduled, clearing the airport of some of the hundreds of passengers who spent the night 
there.
At Gatwick, southeast of London, where 44 flights were canceled early Friday, officials were hopeful that normal 
schedules would resume during the day.
Staff at Manchester Airport said most flights were operating as usual, though flights on Continental, PIA, and Delta 
Airlines to New York, and US Airways flights to Philadelphia were delayed.

Body
The Dublin share market made further losses today as the slide started by yesterday's terrorist alert in the UK 
continued.
Ryanair was again the main loser, sinking by 20c to 724, after its 26c drop yesterday.
The airline was forced to cancel more than 100 flights in the wake of the alert this week, with many other flights 
delayed.
 Trading volumes on the Dublin market were hit by the traditional August slump. Also, with both London and New 
York markets largely treading water, Irish investors were reticent about committing in any great force amid 
continued worry over geo-politics, inflation and oil prices. Fear that rising inflation in the US will dampen economic 
growth was a key feature of trading both here and abroad after US retail sales bounced back in July after sliding 
into negative territory the previous month, recording its biggest gain since January in the process. Typical of the day 
was the fact that even a broker upgrade failed to keep drinks group C & C in the black. It gained 7c initially after the 
upgrade, but ended the day 5c lower at 870. Goodbody Stockbrokers had upgraded their share price target for the 
company to E11 on research showing strong sales of its cider product Magners in the UK. The broker also 
predicted that, in time, C & C could become a takeover target for one of the larger international brewers. It also 
carried out a tele-survey of the Scottish on-trade market at the end of July to assess how Magners has performed 
during the crucial June and July period. It said that it focused on the Scottish market as it is considered to be the 
lead indicator as to where Magners market share in Britain will ultimately settle. Financial stocks put in a mixed 
performance with AIB shares unchanged at 1955, but with Bank of Ireland falling by 8c to 1415, Anglo Irish 
declining by 15c to 1136 and Irish Life & Permanent dropping 55c to 1890. Bank of Ireland said that it would raise 
its interest rates on loans and deposits following the latest 0.25pc base-rate hike from the European Central Bank. 
The bank said that a standard variable homeloan rate will increase by 0.2pc to 4.44pc and an investment variable 
ISEQ ends week with fall of 55.86
homeloan will have a new rate of 4.94pc, an increase of 0.2pc - just under the quarter point rise from the 
eurozone's central bank. Goodbody Stockbrokers noted that figures from Danske Bank's National Irish Bank show 
that it has gained market share in the first half of this year and will open 15 new branches over the next three years, 
ramping up the level of competition in the increasingly busy marketplace. Among the lower caps, shares in Trinity 
Biotech were among the few winners with the stock up 10c to 160 after it reported a solid set of interim results 
earlier this week for the half year. Goodbody's gave the firm a 37pc rise in its forecast earnings per share for the full 
year on the back of Trinity's impressive sales growth and recent bolt-on acquisitions. Readymix, which posed good 
results today, ended 2c higher at 241.

Irish air passengers are set to face further delays and disruption today due to the continuing security alert in the UK.
Ryanair said that some flights today have been cancelled, while knock-on delays are expected, as a result of new 
security checks at British airports.
Aer Lingus and British low cost carrier BMI said it expected they would operate a full schedule.
 Following a major security alert yesterday, passengers on all flights out of UK airports are not allowed to take any 
hand luggage on board. However, the new restrictions on hand luggage introduced at British airports are not being 
imposed in Ireland, with passengers advised that normal procedures will apply today. Aer Lingus passengers 
travelling to Britain for the purpose of catching connecting flights to other destinations have been warned not to 
carry hand luggage, however. Up to 3,500 passengers at Dublin airport were yesterday affected by the cancellation 
of nearly 20 flights to Britain as a result of the security alert. Inbound flights were also cancelled. A significant 
improvement is expected today, but Ryanair said a small number of flights between Stansted and Dublin, Derry and 
Shannon would be affected today. Passengers have been told to check with the airline for up-to-date details prior to 
setting off for the airport.

Airline shares fell yesterday as reports of foiled terrorist attacks sparked fears of a reduction in transatlantic traffic - 
but the wider markets largely shrugged off the news.
European and Asian shares suffered sharp initial falls but steadied after Wall Street opened firmer. In spite of early 
losses, the FTSE 100 closed just 37 points down at 5,823, while the S&P500 was up 0.45 per cent in late afternoon 
trading.
British Airways bore the brunt of the sell-off as its shares fell 5 per cent in London. Rivals such as Lufthansa and Air 
France-KLM also suffered declines. Shares in EasyJet and Ryanair fell 2 per cent and3.4 per cent respectively.
Oil prices dropped sharply as investors took the view that security worries might lead to a reduction in air traffic. 
West Texas Intermediate retreated Dollars 1.75 to Dollars 74.60 a barrel.
US companies that operate transatlantic routes, including American, Continental and United Airlines, had more 
modest falls. Some analysts warned that a renewed terrorist threat could damage a nascent recovery in the US air 
market.
Cost cuts and booming passenger numbers, now higher than before September 11 2001, helped most US airlines 
reach profit in the three months to June 30, after a combined loss of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 21bn) in the past five 
years. But US carriers are now relying more on higher margin transatlantic routes.
BA, which makes most of its profit from transatlantic flights, said it could not yet determine the long-term cost or 
impact of heightened security measures.

European airline stocks suffered heavy losses yesterday as equity markets slid on the news of a foiled attempt to 
bomb three US carriers taking off from London's Heathrow Airport.
British police said a pre-planned operation disrupted a plot to detonate explosives carried on board the aircraft in 
hand luggage. The three US airlines targeted were American Airlines, Continental and United Airlines.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.8 per cent to 1,329.72.
British Airways led the declines, falling 5.1 per cent. Air France-KLM fell 3.1 per cent to Euros 19.15, Italy's Alitalia 
shed 2.1 per cent to Euros 0.8635, Irish budget carrier Ryanair lost 3.4 per cent to Euros 7.29 and Germany's 
Lufthansa slid 3.3 per cent to Euros 14.17.
Brokers were largely of the view that share price weakness would be short- term. Panmure said it was not changing 
its "buy" rating on airline stocks, while HSBC retained its "overweight" rating on Lufthansa and raised its target to 
Euros 20 from Euros 17.30. Strategist Jonathan Wober added that Lufthansa's increasing focus on value creation 
was responsible for the move.
EADS fell 5 per cent to Euros 23.33 on fears that this and any future attempt to bring down a passenger plane could 
result in a slump in airline traffic and a knock-on fall in aircraft orders. In addition, Credit Suisse downgraded the 
stock to "neutral" from "outperform" on concerns of furtherpotential problems with delivery.
Telecommunications groups also dragged down the market after Deutsche Telekom warned on profits as it slashed 
its 2006 and 2007 targets. Competition was stifling growth in its domestic markets, the operator said, after reporting 
a7 per cent fall in second-quarter profits, missing market forecasts.
WestLB downgraded the stock to "hold" from "add". Analyst Stefan Borscheid said: "We now have no positive 
recommendation for European incumbents left, and this profit warning is unlikely to ease the pressure on the 
sector."
Foiled bomb plot hurts airlines EUROPE
Deutsche Telekom fell7.5 per cent to Euros 11.17, while Dutch operator KPN fell3.2 per cent to Euros 9.28 and 
France Telecom shed 2 per cent to Euros 15.97.
"On the mobile side, Deutsche Telecom is provided by Siemens and Nokia 3G and Ericsson for 2G," said Guy 
Peddy at Deutsche Bank, explaining which other stocks were likely to be hit in an expected cut in capital 
expenditure at DT.
Ericsson fell 1.8 per cent to SKr21.30, Nokia fell 0.7 per cent to Euros 15.51 and Siemens lost 1.1 per cent to Euros 
62.44.
Securitas, the Swedish provider of security services, fell 11.2 per cent to SKr118.50 after Thomas Berglund, chief 
executive, quit following a more than 50 per cent slump in second-quarter net income.

Airline stocks were hit hard yesterday as news emerged of a foiled terrorist plot to blow up aircraft in mid-flight 
between the UK and US.
Shares in British Airways dropped 5.1 per cent to 370 1/4p as security at British airports was tightened and 
additional security measures were put in place for all flights.
Gert Zonneveld, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said BA's shares were more sensitive to the news than Ryanair, 
down 1.5 per cent to Euros 7.425, and EasyJet, off2.1 per cent to 414p, due to its higher profile name and route 
network across the North Atlantic.
However, he refused to change his "buy" recommendations on the stocks, saying all had substantial cash balances 
and were in much better shape than at the time of the attack on the World Trade Centre in 2001.
Aero engine maker Rolls- Royce was also caught up in the selling, falling 2.3 per cent to 412p.
Fears that the security situation might encourage travellers to stay home sent First Choice Holidays and MyTravel 
Group down 1.4 per cent to 213 3/4p and 2 per cent to 208 1/2p respectively. InterContinentalHotels fell 3.1 per 
cent to 839p and car hire group Avis Europe lost 5.2 per cent to 63 1/2p.
News of the security alert spooked the wider market, sending the FTSE 100 down 100 points in early trade. 
However, a resilient performance saw the main index recover most of its early losses to finish down 37.1 points, or 
0.6 per cent, at 5,823.4. The FTSE 250 fell 67.6 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 9,261.5. Volume was poor, with 2.6bn 
shares changing hands.
Away from the security situation, telecommunications stocks took a beating after Germany's Deutsche Telekom 
slashed its profit forecasts and admitted it was reaching the limits of growth in its home market.
In response, mobile phone group Vodafone fell 3.9 per cent to 112p and BT Group dropped 2.4 per cent to 243 
1/2p. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said Vodafone looked particularly vulnerable since it derived fifteen per cent of its 
earnings from Germany.
Bomb threat pushes shares in BA and travel groups sharply lower LONDON
Housebuilders came under pressure as JPMorgan Cazenove cut its recommendations on Persimmon, down 2.5 
per cent to Pounds 12.16, Redrow, 2.8 per cent weaker at 469 3/4p, and Barratt Developments, off 2.5 per cent to 
917p, from "outperform" to "in-line".
"While we are normally loath to do the obvious, we have downgraded our recommendations following last week's 
tightening of monetary policy in the UK," the broker said.
Smiths Group fell 4.7 per cent to 840 as Dresdner Kleinwort cut its target on the stock from 950p to 890p following a 
trading update from the engineering group. Dresdner said while Smiths was reassuring on margin progression, its 
warning over the impact of adverse currency movements meant the going would get tougher at the company.
International Power bucked the sliding market, rising 3.4 per cent to 316 1/2p after the utility unveiled a 69 per cent 
jump in first-half profits and said it expected 2006 to be a year of strong growth. Charles Stanley, the stockbrokers, 
raised its recommendation on the stock from "reduce" to "hold", saying the figures were well ahead of its forecasts.
Among the mid-caps, Spirent Communications rose 4.2 per cent to 43 1/4p after well-received first-half figures from 
the telecoms testing group. UBS reiterated its "buy" recommendation and 60p price target on the stock, saying 
revenues were better than it expected.
UBS added that the recent build-up of a 9.6 per cent stake by activist investor Sherborne was likely to prompt 
Spirent's management to accelerate its restructuring programme.
Enodis dropped 8.1 per cent to 165p after the food services group said it had turned down a request from US rival 
Middleby seeking deeper due diligence access and an extension to its deadline for making a firm offer for the 
company.
According to Enodis, Middleby - which has a put-up-or-shut-up deadline on August 14 - said that even if its 
demands were met, it could not say whether it would make a firm bid or if it would top the 195p a share approach it 
made in May.
SCi Entertainment, the UK's biggest computer games publisher, rose 3.7 per cent to 460 1/2p amid excitement over 
the imminent launch of Just Cause, a game designed for Microsoft's XBox 360.
Shanks Group climbed 2 per cent to 176 1/2p as talk of a bid for the waste management company resurfaced.

The Dublin market languished in the doldrums again today after yesterday's slump following the terrorist alert in the 
UK and a modest rebound by Ryanair failed to lift stocks.
By 12:30, the ISEQ index was down 29.04 points to 7,622.39.
Trading volumes on the Dublin market were hit by the traditional August slump, although some stocks did come in 
for special scrutiny with Ryanair and C and C in focus.
 While both London and New York markets managed gains, Irish investors were reticent about committing in any 
great force amid continued worry over geo-politics, inflation and oil prices. Shares in drinks group, C and C, stood 
out among the morning's few gainers with the stock up 14c to 877. Earlier today, Goodbody Stockbrokers have 
raised their share price target for food and drinks group C and C to E11 after research showed strong sales of its 
cider product Magners in the UK. The broker also predicted that, in time, the group could become a takeover target 
for one of the larger international brewers.

Highlight: Airlines that charge for baggage should reverse their policy in the light of yesterday's terror plot.
Body
Ryanair and other airlines that charge for baggage should reverse their policy in the light of yesterday's terror plot in 
the UK and requirements that passengers no longer be allowed to take hand-luggage on board, Labour's deputy 
leader, Liz McManus, said today.
She said the security and safety of the travelling public must come before airline profits.
Ryanair currently charges customers E3.50 a bag if they book in their luggage when making their reservation and 
E7 a bag if they check in at the airport.
 These charges are due to rise to E4.50 and E10 respectively from next month. The Wicklow TD said: "It is clear 
that new security arrangements will lead to considerable inconvenience for travellers, but this is now a price that we 
will all have to pay to prevent the massacre of innocent people. "The airline companies will also have a role to play 
and, in particular, the demand for profits must play a secondary role to the need for security. In this regard the 
government should request airlines which are currently charging passengers for checked-in baggage should be 
asked to reverse this policy."

Body
Aer Lingus said that it still plans to go private in September despite a sharp sell-off in airline shares following 
yesterday's foiled terrorist attack in the UK.
Airline stocks throughout Europe and the US tumbled yesterday on fears of a reduction in the number of people 
travelling across the Atlantic, with shares in EasyJet and Ryanair fell 2pc and 3.4pc respectively.
"Its business as usual as far we are concerned," Aer Lingus chief executive Dermot Mannion is quoted as saying in 
the Irish Times.
 "This is an industry subject to major security incidents, but the privatisation process is rolling. This is a hiccup, but 
these things happen in this industry," he said. Aer Lingus has a significant trans-Atlantic business, carrying about 
1.2 million passengers per annum and derives about one-third of its profits and turnover from this business. 
Analysts said while US originating passengers might be less likely to fly to Europe, this could be offset by Irish 
passengers avoiding US carriers and switching to Aer Lingus.

Shares of airlines and travel companies dropped sharply Thursday after British authorities reported they thwarted a 
terrorist plot to blow up several aircraft in flight between the United States and the Britain.
As heightened security measures caused long delays and canceled flights at airports around the country including 
Europe's busiest airport, London's Heathrow experts said the alert could be a severe blow to both industries.
"You will always see a selloff based on the headlines today, but investors and analysts will now be waiting to see 
the depth of issues," said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.
The news sent stocks down across the board, with the FTSE 100 share index in London down 1.3 percent at 
5,785.90, Germany's DAX index down 1.9 percent at 5,596.47 and the CAC-40 in Paris off 1.4 percent at 4,954.36.
British Airways PLC was one of the stocks hardest hit because of its heavy exposure to the trans-Atlantic route. Its 
shares fell 3.9 percent to 374.50 pence ($7.15) in trading on the London Stock Exchange.
BA said it was experiencing severe operational delays Thursday and it was likely some flights would be canceled. It 
said people choosing not to travel Thursday would get a refund.
Budget airline easyJet PLC fell 2.6 percent to 411.75 pence ($7.84) while fellow low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings 
PLC was down nearly 2.8 percent to 7.32 euros ($9.41).
The new security measures banning all hand luggage from all flights leaving the U.K. posed a logistical problem for 
Ryanair, which this year began charging customers for each bag they checked a policy that has swelled the volume 
of luggage carried on board their aircraft.
Among other airlines, Air France-KLM was down 2.8 percent to 19.19 euros ($24.68) in Paris, while Lufthansa was 
down 3.2 percent at 14.16 euros ($18.21) in Frankfurt.
The ban on hand luggage will also likely to hurt some retailers, who run tax-free franchises at airports. Retail 
operations are a major source of income for the airport operators like Ferrovial's BAA PLC. However, BAA was up 
marginally, 0.3 percent, at 936 pence ($17.88).

While airlines and travel companies were dealt a sharp blow Thursday by the discovery of a terrorist plot aimed at 
trans-Atlantic flights, shares of companies that make surveillance and detection technologies were boosted by 
prospects of increased spending on security.
Tourism would feel an immediate impact, experts said, but the longer-term economic effects were likely to be less 
harsh particularly as officials had thwarted the planned attack.
"Sadly, I think the world has learned to live with the threat of sporadic terrorism," said Philip Shaw, chief economist 
at Investec Securities.
Airline shares had already recovered slightly by the close of trading in London.
Analysts said the main immediate impact for airlines would come from the cost of canceled flights, but in the long 
run all airlines would be hit with higher security costs. This sent shares of security technology stocks markedly 
higher.
Inspection-systems maker American Science and Engineering Inc. rose 26 percent to close at $45.64 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. Morgan Keegan analyst Brian W. Ruttenbur said investors may believe the company will win 
new business for its "backscatter" technology, a type of X-ray used to screen passengers at airports.
OSI Systems Inc. rose 9.1 percent to end at $19.14. Ruttenbur said the company's thermal neutron analysis 
technology would be "ideal" for airport personnel screening because it can identify liquid explosives.
Other companies in the security and surveillance industries that saw their shares rise include: L-3 Communications 
Holdings Inc.; Israel's Magal Security Systems Ltd.; Isonics Corp.; Digital Recorders Inc.; and Global ePoint Inc.
Foiled terrorist plot drives airline, travel shares lower, boosts security companies
The plot detected by British officials had targeted United Airlines, American Airlines and Continental Airlines, 
according to U.S. counterterrorism officials. Deputy Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said it 
involved several planes and an intent "to commit mass murder on an unimaginable scale."
Heightened security measures targeting preflight checks and severely limiting onboard baggage led to chaotic 
scenes at airports, forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights.
The worst affected was London's Heathrow, Europe's biggest and busiest airport, catering to 190,000 passengers 
and 1,250 departures and arrivals on an average August day.
British Airways PLC was one of the hardest stocks hit because of its heavy exposure to the trans-Atlantic route and 
its reliance on Heathrow. Its shares fell 5.1 percent to close at 370.25 pence ($7.00) on the London Stock 
Exchange.
U.S. airline shares sold off early but later recovered, with American Airlines parent AMR Corp. closing unchanged at 
$20.29 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, fell 1.3 percent to 
finish at $23.52 on Nasdaq while Continental Airlines fell 1.4 percent to $23.86 on the NYSE.
All short-haul inbound flights to Heathrow were canceled with several outbound flights also canceled or delayed. 
Long-haul flights continued to operate but with lengthy delays.
Flights to and from other airports around the country, including London's Stansted, Gatwick and Luton, were also 
heavily impacted.
Airports operator BAA PLC, which runs Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, said the cancelations would continue into 
Friday, and did not know how long the heightened security measures would be in place.
The ban on hand luggage posed a particular logistical problem for budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, which this 
year began charging customers for each bag they checked. The airline waived its new 2.50 euro ($3.20) fee for 
each carry-on bag that unexpectedly had to be checked in Thursday.
Ryanair shares fell 1.5 percent, while fellow low-cost carrier easyJet PLC fell 2.1 percent. Among other European 
airlines, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were both down 3 percent.
The malaise spread to other travel companies, with British package tour operator MyTravel down 2 percent.
However, analysts said the longer-term outlook was not as pessimistic as was feared after last year's July 7 
bombings on London's transport network that killed 52 commuters.
"You will always see a selloff based on the headlines today, but investors and analysts will now be waiting to see 
the depth of issues," said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.
Holger Schmieding, an analyst with Bank of America in London, said vacationers and business travelers were 
unlikely to change their travel and spending habits by enough to hurt the economy for long.
"We do not expect the thwarted terror plot to affect economic and financial market trends in any significant way," he 
said.
Elliott Frisby, a spokesman for VisitBritain, the country's tourism authority, said it was too early to estimate the 
impact but noted that Britain still had a record year in number of visitors last year despite the London bombings.
Meanwhile, many travelers headed to the railroads in Europe. Eurostar Group Ltd. spokesman Gareth Headon said 
the company's train service across the English Channel had carried 10 percent more passengers than usual 
Thursday and was likely to grow.
AP Business Writer Dan Seymour in New York contributed to this report.

"You will always see a sell-off based on the headlines today, but investors and analysts will now be waiting to see

The plot had targeted United Airlines, American Airlines and Continental Airlines, according to two U.S. 
counterterrorism officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Shares of U.S. airlines were hit hard in early trading, but recovered some ground by late morning. American Airlines 
parent AMR Corp.'s stock fell 1.7 percent to $19.95. Shares of UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, fell 1.5 
percent to $23.47. Continental Airlines Inc. fell 1.2 percent to $23.93.
At Heathrow Airport in London, Europe's busiest airport, all short-haul inbound flights had been canceled with 
several outbound flights also canceled or delayed, said Tony Douglas, managing director for airport operator BAA 
PLC.

Gatwick. Its shares fell 3.9 percent to 374.50 pence ($7.15) in trading on the London Stock Exchange.
Analysts said the main impact on airlines will come immediately from the cost of canceled flights and in the longer 
term from extra expenditure on security. Expenses at BA's home airport of Heathrow which caters to 190,000 
passengers on an average August day could skyrocket, they said.

"The news and airport disruption is negative in the short term for all U.K. airlines, especially for BA at its busiest 
time of the year and will also contribute to negative sentiment for the European airline sector as a whole," said BNP 
Paribas analyst Nick van den Brul.
United Airlines flights from London to the United States are expected to operate about two and a half hours late, 
said spokesperson Robin Urbanski, but the airline hasn't canceled any flights. American Airlines spokesman John 
Hotard said at least one London-bound flight from Chicago has been canceled Thursday morning and a later flight 
from London to Chicago has also been canceled.
The news sent European stocks down across the board, with major indexes in Britain, France and Germany each 
off more than 1 percent.
Budget airline easyJet PLC fell 2.6 percent to 411.75 pence ($7.84) while fellow low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings

Lufthansa was down 3.2 percent at 14.16 euros ($18.21) in Frankfurt.
The ban on hand luggage will also likely hurt some retailers, who run tax-free franchises at airports. Retail 
operations are a major source of income for airport operators like Ferrovial SA, whose shares fell 2.8 percent to 
60.50 euros in Madrid ($77.77). However, its affiliate BAA was up marginally, 0.3 percent, at 936 pence ($17.88).
The malaise also spread to other travel companies, with British package tour operator MyTravel Group PLC down 4 
percent to 204.25 pence ($3.88).
However, companies that make security products especially for airports rose.

The plot detected by British officials had targeted United Airlines, American Airlines and Continental Airlines, 
according to U.S. counterterrorism officials. Deputy Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said it 
involved several planes and an intent "to commit mass murder on an unimaginable scale."
Foiled Terror Plot Hurts Airline Shares
Heightened security measures targeting preflight checks and severely limiting onboard baggage led to chaotic 
scenes at airports, forcing airlines to cancel hundreds of flights.
The worst affected was London's Heathrow, Europe's biggest and busiest airport, catering to 190,000 passengers 
and 1,250 departures and arrivals on an average August day.
British Airways PLC was one of the hardest stocks hit because of its heavy exposure to the trans-Atlantic route and 
its reliance on Heathrow. Its shares fell 5.1 percent to close at 370.25 pence ($7.00) on the London Stock 
Exchange.
U.S. airline shares sold off early but later recovered, with American Airlines parent AMR Corp. closing unchanged at 
$20.29 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, fell 1.3 percent to 
finish at $23.52 on Nasdaq while Continental Airlines fell 1.4 percent to $23.86 on the NYSE.
All short-haul inbound flights to Heathrow were canceled with several outbound flights also canceled or delayed. 
Long-haul flights continued to operate but with lengthy delays.
Flights to and from other airports around the country, including London's Stansted, Gatwick and Luton, were also 
heavily impacted.
Airports operator BAA PLC, which runs Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, said the cancelations would continue into 
Friday, and did not know how long the heightened security measures would be in place.
The ban on hand luggage posed a particular logistical problem for budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC, which this 
year began charging customers for each bag they checked. The airline waived its new 2.50 euro ($3.20) fee for 
each carry-on bag that unexpectedly had to be checked in Thursday.
Ryanair shares fell 1.5 percent, while fellow low-cost carrier easyJet PLC fell 2.1 percent. Among other European 
airlines, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were both down 3 percent.
The malaise spread to other travel companies, with British package tour operator MyTravel down 2 percent.
However, analysts said the longer-term outlook was not as pessimistic as was feared after last year's July 7 
bombings on London's transport network that killed 52 commuters.
"You will always see a selloff based on the headlines today, but investors and analysts will now be waiting to see 
the depth of issues," said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers.
Holger Schmieding, an analyst with Bank of America in London, said vacationers and business travelers were 
unlikely to change their travel and spending habits by enough to hurt the economy for long.
"We do not expect the thwarted terror plot to affect economic and financial market trends in any significant way," he 
said.
Elliott Frisby, a spokesman for VisitBritain, the country's tourism authority, said it was too early to estimate the 
impact but noted that Britain still had a record year in number of visitors last year despite the London bombings.
Meanwhile, many travelers headed to the railroads in Europe. Eurostar Group Ltd. spokesman Gareth Headon said 
the company's train service across the English Channel had carried 10 percent more passengers than usual 
Thursday and was likely to grow.

Airlines across Europe canceled flights bound for London's Heathrow Airport Thursday, and some airports said they 
could take on some of the diverted traffic.
Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, was closed to most incoming European flights Thursday morning, after 
authorities announced they had uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up several aircraft flying between the U.S. and 
Britain using explosives smuggled in hand luggage.
Massive delays created after authorities began enforcing new security regulations banning hand luggage forced 
many European carriers to cancel their flights to Heathrow.
British Airways canceled all of its short-haul flights to and from Heathrow through Thursday afternoon. The airline 
advised passengers to avoid traveling if possible.
At Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, KLM spokesman Hugo Baas said the airline had canceled five flights to Heathrow.
"The backlog for people traveling to and through London is in the hours. That's going to create a ripple effect 
throughout the day, and increase as long as the airport remains closed," he said.
He said KLM was diverting to other London airports, and substituting larger planes where possible to increase the 
number of people getting through.
Cicero Alves Do Nascimento, a 47-year-old Brazilian martial arts teacher, was stuck at Schiphol after his British 
Midland flight to Heathrow was canceled.
"This is not fun at all. You get no compensation. Nobody gets any help here. You feel abandoned," he said, adding 
he was rebooked on a flight for Friday but got no voucher for a hotel or food because the airline said it wasn't to 
blame.
European flights to London canceled after authorities foil terror plot
Frankfurt Airport, Europe's second-busiest, said it was prepared to take any traffic diverted from Heathrow. 
Spokesman Wolfgang Schwalm said security measures had been increased but that no ban on hand luggage had 
been enacted.
Other airports, including Amsterdam's Schiphol and Charles De Gaulle in Paris, also said they would be able to 
accommodate Heathrow-bound planes if necessary.
In Berlin, easyJet, British Airways, AirBerlin and Ryanair canceled their London-bound flights. All flights from Athens 
to airports in the London area were canceled, Athens International Airport said.
Air France canceled all Thursday morning flights to Heathrow because the airport was "saturated," an Air France 
spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity in accordance with the airline's policy.
Spain's Iberia said it had canceled four flights to Heathrow, and Italian carrier Alitalia stopped six flights through 
London.
SAS, the flag carrier for Sweden, Norway and Denmark, canceled its flights to Heathrow from Stockholm, 
Copenhagen and Oslo.

Ryanair led shares on the Dublin market sharply lower today amid news of an alleged foiled terrorist plot to blow up 
several planes flying between the UK and the US.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 75.54 points lower on 7651.43.
News of the UK terror plot hit market sentiment hard in early trading, with the ISEQ down by as much as 100 points. 
However, a positive start on Wall Street, after the US Department of Homeland Security said there was no evidence 
of a terrorist plot in America, sparked a mild recovery.
 Wall Street was also lifted by news the US trade deficit in June narrowed to Â£64.8bn, down from a Â£64.97bn deficit 
in May, which was up from a revised Â£66.07bn gap originally. Police in the UK announced early this morning that 
they had thwarted a major attack by terrorists to blow up around 20 aircraft between the UK and US. As a result, 
hundreds of flights were stopped from flying to London, while passengers were banned from taking aboard hand 
luggage. Major delays and cancellations were experienced, not only in the UK, but throughout Europe. Shares in 
Dublin were also hit by a report from the Central Statistics Office that showed that the annual rate of inflation 
increased by 0.3pc to 4.2pc in June. The rise was the fastest in over three years and came in much higher than 
expected. The CSO said that the rise was the result of rising interest rates which pushed mortgage repayments 
higher and also soaring energy prices which increased the cost of petrol and home heating fuels. Elsewhere, the 
European Central Bank repeated its threat to gradually raise key interest rates further after raising rates by a 
quarter of a percentage point last week. The ECB reaffirmed that further rate rises are on the cards if current 
projections for the eurozone economy prove accurate. No frills airline Ryanair was a notable casualty of the flight 
disruptions caused by news of a thwarted terror plan to blow up several flights from the UK to the US, weakening an 
industry already hit hard by surging oil prices. The airline was forced to cancel more than 100 flights following the 
news with further delays commonplace on other flights. Shares in company fell 26c to 729. Negative trading was

the order of the day with financial stocks suffering heavy losses. AIB was hit hardest, slipping 30c to 1955, while 
Bank of Ireland fell 23c to 1422 and Anglo Irish Bank closed 14c lower on 1146. Irish Life and Permanent dropped 
5c to finish on 1940. The story was the same in the construction sector, where CRH led the fallers, down 55c to 
2545. Grafton closed 8c lower on 1030, while Kingspan fell 24c to 1358 and McInerney slipped 9c to 1076. Other 
notable fallers included FBD Holdings, which fell 39c to 3806, IAWS down 29c to 1476 and Paddy Power, down 12c 
to 1360. Elsewhere, pharmaceutical group Elan was down 4c to 1149, while recruitment group CPL was one of the 
few major stocks to make any headway, closing 5c higher on 405.

British Airways shares suffered most from the closure of Heathrow because of terrorist bomb threats and remained 
top of the FTSE 100 loser board for most of the day closing 19.75p down at 370.25p valuing the national carrier at 
under Â£4.2 billion.
'The news and airport disruption is negative in the short term for all UK airlines, especially for BA at its busiest time 
of year' French-owned broker Exane BNP said in a note to clients that reiterated its 'underperform' 
recommendation.
It says the main impact was likely to be on the long-haul sector and could be as financially damaging as the 2005 
baggage handlers' strike that cost an estimated Â£35-40 million.
Other airlines moved in sympathy with Ryanair 0.355 lower at 7.175 and easyJet down 8.75p to 414p. BP shares 
closed above their worst at 615p, down 4.5p, after admitting that the cost of fixing the corrosion in its Alaskan 
pipeline will be around Â£52 million.
The loss of 400,000 barrels of oil in what amounts to 8% of US oil production will cost it much more than that, 
however. The share price was not helped by the easing of the oil price, Brent crude for September delivery falling 
73 cents a barrel to $76.55.
Having taken over the Swedish savings group Skandia, Old Mutual said that first half sales were 8% up on what 
they were a year ago. Even so the shares slipped 4.25p to 153.75p valuing the Anglo South African group at Â£8.4 
billion.
Royal & Sun Alliance shares eased 4p to 129.5p after revealing a 24% increase in profit for the six months to 30 
June.
The shares in the news were the most active, notably British Airways with 43.4 million, BP with 44.3 million, Old 
Mutual with 19.8 million and Royal & Sun Alliance with 76.4 million. Vodafone, down 4.5p to 112p, was by far the 
busiest, however, with nearly 550 million changing hands.
Barclays lost 12p to 632p after it said that it planned to fight a Â£24.5 million lawsuit filed by the Italian Banc Popolare 
di Intra over alleged losses from derivative trading.
Thursday Closing Market: BA shares grounded by Heathrow terror threat
Best performers were the utilities International Power, 10.25p better at 316.5p, Kelda, 15.5p up at 819p, and Drax, 
13.5p higher at 924.5p.
Xstrata, up 52p to Â£22.42, was the best performing mining stock. Brewer SABMiller was also close to the top of the 
leader board, rising 17.5p to Â£10.39.5.
The FTSE 100 closed at 5,826.4, down 34.1 points after trading through the day between 5,826.4 and 5,860.5. The 
other key London indices also lost ground, notably the FTSE 250, down 67.6 points to 9,261.5. Volume picked up 
after a slow morning with 1.64 billion shares changing hands in 215,644 deals.
Shares were down on a broad front, in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial index 
was 15.37 points lower at 11,091.83 as London closed. In Paris the CAC-40 finished the afternoon 65.94 points 
lower at 4,959.22, while in Frankfurt the German DAX 30 was 102.96 down at one point during the afternoon.
The US dollar firmed up in the foreign exchange markets after better than expected trade figures for June. The 
deficit was $64.8 billion against $65 billion in May. The gap narrowed because exports rose 2% awhile imports only 
increased 1.2% to $185.5 billion.
Sterling closed at 1.8881 against the overnight 1.9067, but was little changed against the Euro at 1.4805 compared 
to the overnight 1.4807.

The closure of London Heathrow as part of a major anti-terrorist campaign to prevent the blowing up of passenger 
aircraft in-flight, had a greater effect on the stock market than the overnight sell off in New York.
Prices were sharply marked down from the start, the FTSE 100 bottoming at 5,752.6, down 107.9 points, at 0916. 
The attempted rally that followed lacked any spark and at 1.18 pm the index was still 78.4 points lower at 5,782.1.
British Airways was the worst hit share losing 20.75p to 369.25p, a fall of 5.32%. With 22 million going through the 
market it was also the morning's fifth most active stock after Vodafone with 240 million, BT, BP and Old Mutual.
In sympathy, Ryanair fell 0.308 to 7.22, while easyJet dropped 9.125p to 413.625p.
Another weak sector was house building after blue-blooded broker Cazenove cut its recommendation on all but a 
handful of stocks after last week's surprise interest rate hike. Persimmon, Barratt, Bellway, Redrow, Wilson Bowden 
and George Wimpey were all down by between 7.75p and 36p.
Only three of the top 100 shares added value during the morning: International Power, 7.5p up at 314.25p following 
strong first half figures, Yorkshire-based utility Kelda Group, 4.5p higher at 808p, and supermarket Tesco 1.25 
better at 362.25p after a research report said it would become the UK's biggest non-food retailer by the end of the 
year.
Other the other key indices lost ground the biggest fall being shown by the FTSE 250, down 109.5 at 9,219.6. 
Volume was thin with 117,495 deals involving 883.2 million shares.
International network technology group Spirent Communications was top of the FTSE 250 leader board with a 
1.75p gain to 43.25p after its interims and became the most active share with over 14 million changing hands. 
Worst performer was Enodis, down 11.25p to 168.25p.
New York is expected to pick up the mood of London's foiled bomb plot, and dealers expect the Dow Jones 
industrial index to fall by up to 44 points to between 11,045-11,051. 
US trade data for June is expected to come out before the market opens with the deficit expected to widen to $64.5 
billion from May's $63.8 billion.
Thursday Lunchtime Market: Heathrow bomb plot hits shares worldwide
The London bomb plots inevitably affected other European stock markets. In Paris the French CAC-40 was 72.46 
points lower at 4,952.69 at 1 pm with EADS, France-KLM and Sanofi-Aventis the biggest fallers. 
In Frankfurt the German DAX 30 at 12.02 pm was down 105.96 points to 5,552.73 with Deutsche Telekom the 
worst affected after a surprise profit warning.
International currency markets saw hectic trading with the pound dropping to a low of 1.8982 against the US dollar, 
while the Euro moved up to 0.6772.
The pound later covered most of its earlier losses to stand at 1.9033 against the US dollar compared to the 
overnight 1.9067. In terms of the Euro sterling was back to 1.4806 against Wednesday's closing Euro of 1.4807.

(Update) The delays at UK airports caused by an averted terrorist attempt to bomb inflight trans-Atlantic flights and 
a late sell-off in New York on interest rate concerns prompt widespread falls in UK and European markets. By 9.30 
am the FTSE 100 index was above its early worst but still down 92 points at 5,769, the Mid-250 index was 132 
points weaker at 9,197 and the techMARK 19 points easier at 1,293. In Paris the CAC-40 was down 57 points 
Predictably airlines were badly hit as incoming flights were delayed or cancelled and British Airways banned any 
hand luggage being allowed on flights leaving the UK.
BA at 367p and easyJet 405p fell 22p and 17p while Ryanair eased 28 cents to 7.24. In a sea of red on dealing 
screens International Power managed to hold steady at 308.25p, up 2p in response to better-than-expected profits 
and strong growth outlook, but positive statements failed to support Smiths Group at 861p, down 21p, Old Mutual, 
3.25p easier at 154.75p or Royal & Sun Alliance, 3.25p lower at 130.25p. Inflation and interest rates worries 
weighed heavily on the miners where loses of between 16p and 64p were recorded against Anglo American at 
Â£22.53, BHP Billiton 973p, Lonmin Â£26.44 and Rio Tinto Â£26.75p. Oils receded under the lead of BP, 11p down at 
609p, as the Alaskan pipeline repairs looked set to continue into next year. Falls into double figures were frequent 
elsewhere with AstraZeneca at Â£31.64, British Land Â£13.16, Reckitt Benckiser Â£17.15, Next Â£16.15, Wolseley 
Â£10.67 and Standard Chartered Â£12.67 among the worst hit. Among the smaller caps Freeport stood out at 45p, up 
32p, after confirming bid approaches and Premier Direct hardened 2p to 31p on news that Peter Gyllenhammer had 
increased his stake to almost 12%. QXL Ricardo returned from suspension at Â£95, up 899p following the end of 
Polish administration. Earthport picked up 4p to 26p on its agreements to supply products and services to Smart 
Card, Global Cash Card and MyECheck and strong DVD sales supported Metrodome Group at 4.12p, up 0.25p. 
Punch Taverns gave up 5p to 877p on the sale of its Old Orleans unit to Regent Inns, steady at 77p. Spirent Inns 
was little changed at 41p, a sharp profits turnround already discounted, but an upbeat statement lifted Lok'N'Store 
2p to 157p. Homebuy was suspended at 208p pending clarification of its financial position while good figures and 
contracts news failed to inspire Vanco at 457p, down 10p. Playtech improved 3p to 248p on winning a UKBetting 
casino contract and Murchison United edged up a fraction to 3p after being granted two more exploration permits in 
Guinea. Bumper profits boosted Aquarius Platinum 7p to 907p

Markets in the UK and Europe open sharply lower in the wake of a late-sell off in New York due to concerns over 
slowing economic growth and the prospect of at least one further interest rate hike. At home the gloomy mood was

Ryanair 18 cents easier at 7.35 following delays at all UK airports after a major threat to potentially bomb an inflight

 It added that flight departures from other UK Airports are experiencing delays with first wave departures from 
Liverpool, Luton, Glasgow Prestwick and East Midlands suffering 1 hour delays. Flights between non-UK airports 
remain largely unaffected, it said. The airline said that it was hopeful that afternoon departures will depart on time, 
however, it added that. given the backlog of passengers at UK airports. further delays and cancellations are

Ryanair Holdings PLC announced a major expansion Wednesday at its Dublin headquarters, where it plans a 
dozen new routes involving three new aircraft and more than 200 new employees.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the expansion, being rolled out from December to February, would bring to 63 
the number of routes operating from Dublin to Britain and continental Europe.
The new routes are to and from Oslo, Norway; the Spanish cities of Almeria, Madrid, Seville and Vitoria; Tampere, 
Finland; Billund, Denmark; Bologna, Italy; Grenoble, France; Friedrichshafen, Germany; Pula, Croatia; and 
Rzeszow, Poland.
O'Leary said Ryanair would never impose fuel surcharges one of the budget airline's major barbs against 
competitors even if the cost of oil exceeded $200US (â¬160) a barrel.
"Ryanair will never introduce fuel surcharges, today tomorrow or ever, even if it reaches 200 dollars a barrel," 
O'Leary said. "Admittedly, if it hits 200 a barrel we'll be the only airline left flying in Europe."
Ryanair shares slipped 6 cents (8 U.S. cents) to â¬7.54 ($9US.71) in midafternoon trade on the Irish Stock 
Exchange in Dublin.

Scandinavian airline group SAS AB on Wednesday posted a 1.2 percent drop in profits as higher fuel costs offset 
an increase in passenger numbers.
Net profit for the quarter fell to 489 million kronor (â¬53.23 million; US$68.39 million), from 495 million kronor a year 
earlier.
The number of passengers carried in the quarter rose 8.7 percent to 18.8 million, boosting total sales to 17.92 
billion kronor (â¬1.95 billion; US$2.51 billion), from 16.02 billion kronor in the second quarter of 2005.
However, fuel costs rose 24 percent from the year-ago quarter, biting into profits.
"There is still no indication of a slowdown in the market, but uncertainty remains regarding the future strength of 
market growth and the trend of jet fuel," said acting Chief Executive Gunnar Reitan.
The profits were lower than expected but sales came in above analysts' forecasts. SAS shares fell 2.8 percent to 78 
kronor (â¬8.50; US$10.90) in Stockholm trading.
SAS said it has implemented about half of a 2.5 billion cost-savings package aimed at making its units more 
efficient and productive by the end of 2007.
Reitan indicated that more measures may come soon, saying "further cost-cutting needs to be done to ensure long-
term competitiveness."
Reitan became acting CEO after Jorgen Lindegaard stepped down from the post in May. The company gave no 
indication of when a permanent replacement may be appointed.
The travel group operates Scandinavian Airlines, which is the joint carrier of Sweden, Denmark and Norway. The 
group also includes regional airlines Blue1, Spanair, SAS Braathens, Wideroe, airBaltic and Estonian Air, as well as 
the Rezidor SAS hotel chain.
SAS airline group sees earnings fall 1.2 percent in second quarter
SAS' second quarter results underperformed those of other major European airlines. British Airways PLC and fast 
expanding Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC posted strong profit growth for the three months to June.
Analysts have warned that trading conditions are likely to get tougher over the winter in Europe due to tough pricing 
competition and weaker demand.

Body
Financial and construction stocks led the Dublin market sharply higher yesterday as the ISEQ continued its recent 
revival, with investors continuing to see value in the market.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 57.47 points higher on 7726.97.
Meanwhile, Wall Street was higher in early deals as a buoyant sales outlook from Cisco Systems offset 
disappointment after the Fed Reserve signalled a pause rather than an end to interest-rate hikes on Tuesday.
 The Fed announced, as expected, that it was leaving rates steady at 5.25pc, the first time in 2 years or 18 policy 
meetings that rates have been left unchanged. However, in the statement which followed, the Fed noted that 
inflation risks remain, although it said that these are likely to dissipate over time, given that the pace of economic 
activity is growing. One FOMC member voted for a rate hike. Dissenters are very rare on the FOMC, highlighting 
the degree of uncertainty regarding the outlook for US rates. With the Fed reserving the right to raise rates again as 
it sees fit, the sense of finality investors had hoped for never materialised. Back in Dublin, construction stocks led 
the way yesterday, with CRH climbing 2c to 2572, Grafton up 8c to 1038 and Kingspan up 10c to 1382. McInerney 
tacked on 9c to close on 1085. Irish Life and Permanent was the star performer in the financial sector, climbing 45c 
to 1945, while Bank of Ireland jumped 20c to 1441. Elsewhere, Anglo Irish Bank made modest gains, up 4c to 1154, 
while AIB bucked the trend, slipping 2c to 1976. Meanwhile, shares in insurance group FBD Holdings soared by 
more than 1pc, or 43c to 3803, while food and agri-business group IAWS, jumped 35c to 1505. Kerry Group was 
another major gainer, up 21c to 1621, with C and C down 6c to 857. Ryanair was down 5c to 755 despite the no-
frills airline announcing yesterday that it is to add 12 new routes from Dublin Airport in December, taking the total 
number of routes to 63. The airline also confirmed plans to base three new aircraft in the Irish capital. Shares in 
Fyffes' property spin-off, Blackrock International, remained unchanged on 38c, after the group confirmed a E4.5m 
property investment in the UK. The property comprises around 16,000 square feet of office accommodation in

Milton Keynes in England. The company also said it was looking at 'several' other deals in a number of locations 
and anticipated further announcements this year. Elsewhere on the market, shares in pharmaceutical group Elan 
succumbed to profit taking again yesterday, falling 17c to 1153, while bookmaker Paddy Power slipped 1c to 1374 
and recruitment group CPL Resources fell 5c to 400.

Body
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair today announced twelve new routes from Dublin Airport bringing the number of routes 
served from Dublin to 63.
The airline said that the expansion will create around 200 additional jobs for pilots, cabin crew and sales staff.
The expansion will see an additional three aircraft based at Dublin Airport from December this year.
 The new routes, to Oslo, Madrid, Tampere (Finland), Vitoria (Spain), Billund (Denmark), Bologna, Grenoble, 
Friedrichshafen (Germany), Seville, Pula (Croatia), Almeria (Spain) and Rzeszow (Poland), will commence 
operation between December 2006 and February 2007 and will be served on a year round basis. Chief executive 
Michael O'Leary claimed that the new routes would challenge Aer Lingus on its Spanish and Italian routes, and he 
also claimed that the expansion meant that Ryanair was now "Ireland's national airline". Speaking at a press 
conference this morning, Mr O'Leary said that the new routes would bring around 900,000 additional passengers 
through Dublin Airport next year. He said the new routes had been introduced to fill in gaps in its own schedule and 
to meet the demands of customers who had been calling for these destinations to be served. The move comes after 
the airline warned last week that it faces a difficult winter due to high oil prices and difficult trading conditions. Mr 
O'Leary today reiterated those warnings and cautioned that should oil prices rise considerably higher than USD74 
per barrel, then there is a chance that Ryanair will post a loss in the final quarter. However, he reiterated that 
Ryanair would "never introduce fuel surcharges regardless of whether oil prices hit USD200 per barrel". With 
passenger numbers continuing to soar at the airline, Mr O'Leary said that he expects numbers to almost double to 
80 million per year within five years. Mr O'Leary also took the opportunity to launch a broadside at EU officials who 
claim that Ryanair's booking system "misleads" customers. He said that the EU was to blame for many of the 
additional charges and taxes and that Brussels was merely trying to disguise this fact by trying to get Ryanair to 
hide such charges in its prices.

Body
The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) today welcomed news from Ryanair that it plans to open 12 new routes from 
Dublin Airport and base three new aircraft there.
The expansion by the low-fares airline brings the number of routes served from Dublin to 63.
Commenting on the announcement DAA Director, Robert Hilliard said "This announcement is very timely given that 
construction will commence next week on a our new Check-in area 14 which will be used by Ryanair when 
completed. This new check-in area will provide an additional 25 new check-in desks, will have capacity to cater for 
in excess of 4 million departing passengers per annum and will be delivered in December this year."
 While the availability of new destinations is very welcome for passengers travelling through Dublin Airport, Mr. 
Hilliard also emphasised the importance of slot co-ordination at Dublin Airport for 2007 schedules. Slot co-
ordination is an important element of the efficient use of airport facilities and effectively means that, with an even 
distribution of flight schedules during peak times, the Airport will be better able to comfortably cater for the growing 
numbers expected at the Airport.

Shares on the Dublin market closed sharply higher today as the ISEQ's good run continues following gains of more 
than 200 points last week.
The ISEQ closed 48.34 points higher on 7669.50.
Market sentiment was also boosted by a positive start on Wall Street amid expectations that the Federal Reserve 
would, at its meeting tonight, pause for breath in its rate hiking campaign for the first time since May 2004.
 Most investors expect the Fed to keep its key interest rate unchanged at 5.25pc after 17 consecutive increases at 
its previous meetings. However, dealers said they are waiting for the Fed's outlook on the growth and inflation 
prospects for the world's largest economy, especially in light of the recent increase in oil prices. Many analysts 
believe Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues will decide they don't need to raise rates further, at least 
for now, because of growing signs that the economy is slowing. Last week, the government reported a fourth 
straight month of weak job growth, with the unemployment rate rising from 4.6pc to 4.8pc in July. Another report 
showed the overall economy, after racing ahead at an annual rate of 5.6pc in the first three months of the year, 
slowed to less than half that pace - 2.5pc - in the spring. Bernanke raised expectations of a pause when he 
delivered the Fed's latest economic forecast to Congress last month, saying the central bank believed that a 
slowing economy would lower inflation pressures over the next two years. In Dublin, strength came from 
pharmaceutical group Elan, up 37c to 1170, after it last week reported a smaller second-quarter loss and predicted 
it would return to profit soon because of the burgeoning sales of multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. Leading financial 
stocks were mostly in the black, with AIB up11c to 1978, Bank of Ireland, up 17c to 1427 and Irish Life and 
Permanent, up15c to 1900. Anglo Irish Bank bucked the trend, slipping 1c to 1150. Shares in the construction 
sector endured a similar day, with CRH leading the way, jumping 13c to 2566, while Kingspan climbed 16c higher to 
1361 and McInerney gained 1c to 1076. Elsewhere, Grafton slipped 8c to 1030. C and C traded in positive territory 
after broker Goldman Sachs upgraded the food and drinks distributor to a "Buy" on the back of strong sales of its 
Elan and C&C lead ISEQ higher
cider brand Magners in the UK. Shares in C and C jumped 8c yesterday to close on 863. Other notable movers 
included insurance group DCC, which jumped 6c to 1871, fruit group Fyffes, up 5c to 142 and Icon, up 185c to 
52.05. Bookmaker Paddy Power made marginal gains, up 3c to 1358, while no-frills airline Ryanair tacked on 2c to 
757.

Delta Golf reborn
Not far from the original Pilgrim's Way of Chaucer fame, Concorde lovers everywhere now have their own place of 
pilgrimage in Weybridge, Surrey, one of the spiritual homes of British aviation. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of 
renowned Concorde aficionado Gordon Roxburgh and a team of supersonic stalwarts at Brooklands museum, delta 
wing fans of every vintage can pay homage to this wonderful machine in virtually factory new condition. Officially 
opened by His Royal Highness Prince Michael of Kent on 26 July, the restored aircraft G-BBDG is now the 
museum's star exhibit.
"I made my first Concorde flight on Delta Golf in 1974, and who'd have thought that I'd be here 32 years later at the 
official opening...wearing the same tie!" joked museum patron Prince Michael. The quality of the restoration of this 
Concorde - which as serial number 202 was the first UK-built production aircraft - is remarkable. This airframe, 
which had lain all but derelict at Filton in recent years, was shipped to Brooklands by road two years ago in pieces 
and now stands proudly in the original Birdseed Airways red-tail colours of the 1970s.
A visit on board Delta Golf includes a "flight" in the fully furnished forward cabin where a sound and video show 
hosted by former BA chief Concorde pilot Mike Bannister provides a realistic simulation of what take-off and the 
transonic acceleration was like aboard "The Rocket".

More people are travelling with no frills airline easyJet, whose aircraft are more crowded than ever with revenue 
during the last 12 months topping Â£1.57 billion against Â£1.29 billion in the 12 months to July 2005.
Europe's number two airline after Ryanair (RYA) carried 3.2 million passengers in July, 11.3% more than in the 
same month a year ago. On average its aircraft were 90.4% full against 88.4% in July 2005.
This lifts the running total for the year to 32.4 million, 12.9% higher than the 28.7 million carried in the 12 months to 
July 2005, but the load factor at 84.6% is slightly down on the 85.2% for the year to July 2005.
Shares in the Luton-based airline fell 8.375p to 423.125p in early trading, a reflection of the weak start to the market 
rather than a reaction to the figures. The group has a stock market value of over Â£1.7 billion.
easyJet (EZJ) carried 8.8 million passengers in the three months to the end of June, 15.8% higher than the 7.6 
million in the same 2005 quarter.
On average, each aircraft was 86% full in the quarter against 84.9% for the comparable period while revenue 
increased 34.2% to Â£460.2 million against Â£342.9 million. Revenue per seat increased 17.3% from Â£38.43 to 
Â£45.07.
When the group published its traffic statistics for June, easyJet upgraded its guidance for the year and said that 
profit growth would be between 40-50%.
It repeats this guidance in a trading statement for the three months to June and says capacity growth should be 
around 13% with both revenue and costs slightly higher than previously indicated.
During the quarter it started 19 new routes expanding from its new base at Milan where it operates 12 routes to 
Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Greece, the UK and Portugal. A further 11 routes were launched connecting UK 
bases in London, Scotland and Liverpool with various European destinations; four routes began operating between 
bases in France and Switzerland to destinations in Italy, Spain, and Turkey.
easyJet, which now operates 121 aircraft on 267 routes between 74 airports in 21 countries, has also expanded 
outside the European Union recently adding Croatia, Turkey, and Morocco.

Body
Shares on the Dublin market shot ahead today following a rally in stocks in New York and London and on the back 
of a recent spate of encouraging earnings reports from the likes of CRH, AIB and Elan.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 101.86 points higher on 7704.24 - up 224 points for the week as a whole.
Shares in London were boosted today by increasing speculation that the Bank of England is almost certain to leave 
interest rates unchanged in September after shocking markets on Thursday with a quarter point hike - its first in 
over two years.
 "Generally central banks like to flag their intentions in advance these days, and, while a rate hike had been 
expected from the bank, the timing was a shock," NCB Stockbrokers said today in its weekly economic report. 
"However, it seems unlikely that this is the beginning of a renewed series of rate increases from the Bank. There is 
a chance that rates could be raised to 5pc but that is likely to be at least three months away and not a high 
probability in our view". Meanwhile, the European Central Banks decision to raise interest rates, also on Thursday, 
came as no shock and had been priced in by investors prior to the announcement. Although the accompanying 
statement from ECB President Jean Claude Trichet failed to rule out a rate rise in September, the general 
consensus is that it will be October before we see the next rate hike. In the US, shares on Wall Street opened firmer 
as weaker-than-expected US jobs data fuelled hopes that interest rates may have peaked. According to the US 
Labour Department, the total number of non-farm payrolls rose by 113,000 in the month, short of the 135,000 
flagged by the market. The Federal Reserve is due to meet next week to decide whether to raise interest rates, 
however, analysts have predicted that the US central bank will leaves rates unchanged. Back in Dublin, CRH was 
the days star performer, climbing an impressive 57c, or 2.25pc, to 2592. Other construction stocks were also 
higher, with Grafton up 7c to 1043 and Kingspan 25c higher on 1365. McInerney turned in a strong performance 
after the building firm announced earlier in the week that it has added to its presence in the UK with the purchase of 
Bowey Homes, which builds houses in the north-east of England. The group predicted that the Â£23.6m acquisition 
ISEQ closes 116 higher, up 242 on week
would boost earnings immediately. McInerney closed 16c higher on 1075. Irish Life and Permanent led the way in 
the financial sector, climbing 22c to 1872, while bank of Ireland tacked on 23c to 1438 and AIB closed 7c higher on 
1989. Anglo Irish Bank was unchanged on 1166. Elsewhere, shares in Ryanair ended the week in buoyant fashion 
after posting a 23pc increase in passengers during July compared to June. The no-frills airline closed 11c higher on 
7.58. Other notable movers included Kerry Group, which closed 56c higher on 1586, Paddy Power, up 6c to 1361 
and ICON, which tacked on 30c to 5020. Meanwhile, Elan ended the week in style, up 45c to 1185.

ISEQ down ahead of ECB rates decision

Body
Shares on the Dublin market fell marginally lower this morning following yesterday's sharp gains, as the attention of 
investors centres firmly on today's interest rate decisions by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.
At midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 31.26 to 7615.55.
The ECB is fully expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.00pc, while the BoE is set to leave rates on 
hold, but with a small risk of a hike.
 Given that an ECB hike is already priced in, investors will be looking to ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet's 
accompanying speech for clues on whether rates could rise more aggressively in the coming months. Trichet's 
speech may have to be particularly hawkish for the euro to make any progress from here, however, analysts 
reckon. 'Ahead of the ECB meeting and its following press conference the euro has little to gain,' analysts at BNP 
Paribas said. 'Not only that interest rate markets have priced in a 25 basis point move today, the markets have also 
been positioned for the ECB to operate at an increased pace of further tightening moves,' they said. In Dublin, the 
financials endured a mixed morning with Bank of Ireland down 16c to 1410, and Irish Life and Permanent up 28c to 
1878. AIB and Anglo Irish Bank were unchanged on 1994 and 1170 respectively. Amongst the construction stocks, 
CRH was down 26c to 2552, Grafton fell 15c to 1040, while Kingspan was unchanged on 1335. McInerney was 
down 5c to 1090 after it announced it has bought UK house builder, Bowey Homes, for E34.5m. Other notable 
movers included C and C group, up 10c to 850, FBD Holdings, up 30c to 3765 and Kerry Group, down 27c to 1510. 
Paddy Power slipped 10c to 1335 as investors pocketed yesterday's profits, while Ryanair was 9c lower on 748.

Top 10 tips for property barons

Identifying the next property hotspot has become something of a national sport. And it isnt just UK properties we are 
talking about. So if you fancy yourself as a property speculator you might take a trip to Excel in September to talk to 
the experts at the Property Investor Show (22 to 24 September, ExCeL London).
According to the organisers, the experts have identified the top ten indicators to look out for. Top of the list is an 
expanding economy and increase in tourism which will push rental demand and increase the returns on capital 
invested.
The experts warn that political stability is important and advise investors to research the political environment of the 
country in which they are planning on investing, especially if there has been a history of war and instability.
Investors should also check on government and private investment in the area as this encourages improvements in 
the local infrastructure and amenities and brings money into the area, pushing house prices up.
The same applies to local transport links. Accessibility is a major factor with new or expanded airports and 
upgraded roads and railways increasing the inward movement to an area. Anyone who doubts this should take a 
look at what the inauguration of Ryanair flights has done across wide regional areas of Italy and France.
Another important consideration is that the house buying process should be simple. Countries where most property 
is unregistered, and establishing good title is difficult, may have cheap property prices but to whom are you going to 
sell if you cannot prove that you own the property?
The experts suggest investors keep abreast of legal issues surrounding foreigners access to the housing market or 
the removal of purchasing restrictions which allows investors to move in and take advantage of the lower property 
prices before everyone else jumps on the bandwagon.
Its also worthwhile investigating whether any large companies intend to relocate to the area. This brings instant 
investment and employees relocate to the area, pushing up both rental rates and property prices. Corporate lets, for 
example in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, are a good opportunity for investors.
Planned entry to the European Union also brings the expectation of inward investment and the easing of restrictions 
on the movement of capital and trade. Cyprus has done well from EU accession in particular.
Top 10 tips for property barons
Areas where large scale leisure facilities are being constructed are a good bet too. Ski runs, golf courses and hotels 
increase property prices and push up demand for second homes.
The experts put low-cost flight routes opening up at number nine on their list. There are those who would argue it 
ought to be higher up. Cheap charter flights that fly directly into an area increase the demand for holiday homes and 
rented accommodation.
Finally watch out for the effects of hosting an international sporting event such as the Olympics. This has already 
pushed up house prices in the area of East London where the games will be held.
Identifying hotspots needs a lot of market knowledge as prices are obviously governed in most places more by the 
local property buyer than by the overseas property buyer, commented Trisha Mason, managing director of VEF 
French Property. You need to know about proposed transport links, about company investment in the area, what 
trends are occurring within the market and to understand the culture of the country.
By the time hotspots have hit the media they are old news. There are still some places where property values 
remain low and where there is a good opportunity to see strong capital growth within five years but there are not 
many and they are guarded jealously, so you have to act fast to keep ahead.
Over 100 overseas property companies operating in a range of markets are exhibiting at the Property Investor 
Show in September and will be on hand to give advice. Exhibitors will include VEF French Property, Florida 
Countryside, Brazil Property Services and MacAnthony Realty.
The show will also be host to trade associations, estate agents, developers, mortgage and finance specialists from 
the UK and a comprehensive programme of expert-led seminars focusing on different industry issues, giving visitors 
all the information they need to successfully invest in property. Further details on the Property Investor Shows are 
available at www.propertyinvestor.co.uk.

Body
Drug development group, Amarin, which is a spin-off from Elan, today reported a pre-tax loss of USD6.98 million for 
the second quarter to June 30, from a loss of 6.39 million a year before, and said it should have enough cash to 
fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2007 -- and beyond if revenue is generated from potential partnerships.
Amarin noted that its widened net loss -- which stood at USD6.8 million against USD6.1 million last time -- was a 
result of substantial R and D investments, in particular for final-phase trials of Miraxion, a compound to fight 
Huntington's disease.
'Amarin made significant progress on the execution of its strategy during the second quarter,' management said. 
 Last month, the company enrolled 240 patients for a Phase III trial in Europe of its Miraxion drug to treat 
Huntington's disease. The enrolment was completed ahead of schedule, the AIM-listed pharmaceuticals company 
said. The trial will take place in Austria, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK. Amarin was founded by former 
Elan finance director Tom Lynch and also includes Ryanair-founder Tony Ryan on its share register.

Body
Shares on the Dublin market powered ahead by more than 100 points today following a string of strong earnings 
results from Irish companies in recent weeks.
The ISEQ index closed 119.95 points higher on 7646.81.
The eyes of investors will tomorrow turn to the ECB and its decision on whether to hike interest rates, with a 0.25pc 
rise widely expected.
 A rise in interest would normally spell trouble for share prices and send them plummeting, however, Stuart Draper 
of Dolmen Securities this evening said the rally in the ISEQ was down to a string of exceptional earnings results 
from the likes of AIB Ryanair and CRH and had nothing to do with the ECB rate decision. "I don't see the ECB 
having a big effect on the shares market today unless Trichet signals stronger than expected rate tightening policy", 
he said. This week alone has seen AIB, Ryanair and Elan all deliver strong results. Meanwhile, the market was also 
supported by a strong start on Wall Street, despite continued fighting in the Middle East and rising oil prices. In 
Dublin today, the financials led the way, with AIB trading sharply higher, climbing over 3pc or 68c to 1990. Shares in 
the group soared after it announced strong profits for the first half of the year on Tuesday. AIB reported pre-tax 
profits of E1,214m for the first six months of 2006, up from E825m in the same period last year - well ahead of 
expectations. Bank of Ireland was another major gainer, climbing 30c to 1426, while Anglo Irish Bank tacked on 30c 
to 11.69 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 35c to 1850. Construction stocks also performed strongly, with CRH 
up 58c to 2578 after the buildings materials group confirmed on Tuesday that its US arm Oldcastle Materials has 
snapped up a 50pc share in American Cement Company for USD50m in cash. Elsewhere in the sector, Grafton 
tacked on 28c to 1055, Kingspan gained 15c to 13.24 and McInerney climbed 17c to 1095. Ryanair managed slight 
gains, up 3c to 757, despite warning earlier this week that it faces a very tough winter due to volatile oil prices and a 
harsh trading environment. The airline was boosted however by confirmation that it is close to securing a deal with 
a "leading telecoms firm" to install mobile phone kits on its aircraft. Tapping into the mobile market is just one new 
ISEQ shares soar more than 120 points
revenue source that the airline is said to be considering. Paddy Power continued to trade strongly as the Galway 
Races continue, climbing 27c to 1357, while Food and drinks group C and C tacked on 14c to close on 825. Other 
notable movers included drugs group Elan, which fell 24c to 1145, Dragon Oil, down 13c to 255 and Kerry Group, 
which slipped sharply to 1537, down 28c. FBD Holdings managed marginal gains, closing 35c higher on 3735.

A mixed crop of earningsleft European equities struggling to make headway yesterday, with early losses on Wall 
Street further undermining sentiment.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index finished the session0.9 per cent lower at 1,326.70.
KPN bucked the weaker trend after reporting a stronger-than-expected10 per cent rise in second-quarter core 
earnings and an improving outlook.
The company said accelerating fixed-line disconnections were offset by improvements at its German E-Plus division 
and proposed an interim dividend of Euros 0.16. Shares gained 5.6 per cent to Euros 9.39.
"We retain our bullish stance on this name," said Terence Sinclair at Citigroup.
The banking sector reporting season continued with Deutsche Bank unveiling a 30 per cent rise in second-quarter 
net profit.
However, investors were disappointed in the bank's trading performance as revenues at its equity investment unit 
dropped 50 per cent amid "challenging" conditions. The shares fell4.7 per cent to Euros 86.
Allied Irish Banks, however, gained 1.5 per cent to Euros 19.22 after reporting a forecast-beating 47 per cent surge 
in first-half pre-tax profit.
"AIB remains our top Irish bank pick," said Jason Napier at Deutsche Bank. "All divisions are performing well, the 
Irish economy and the segments of the UK market in which it operates are also very strong."
This gave Allied's domestic rivals a welcome boost. Bank of Ireland climbed1.2 per cent to Euros 7.54 and Anglo 
Irish Bank ended flat at Euros 11.42, outperforming a European banking sector that tumbled 1.2 per cent.
KPN gains from strong earnings EUROPE
The luck of the Irish ran out for Ryanair, however, as warnings of a tough winter hit the no-frills airline. In spite of 
reporting a much better-than-expected 80 per cent leap in quarterly profits, Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said 
the "outlook for the rest of the year remains cautious". The stock fell 3.2 per cent to Euros 7.54.
Drugmaker Elan's shares initially rose more than3 per cent after announcing it had cut its losses in the second 
quarter.
However, although the company said it was poised for a return to profitability following the relaunch of its troubled 
multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, the shares succumbed to the pressures of the wider market and ended with a loss 
of 0.3 per cent at Euros 11.69.
Man, the German truckmaker and heavy engineer, climbed 0.5 per cent to Euros 56.88 after it raised its sales and 
profit forecasts following a 60 per cent jump in second-quarter operating earnings. Booming commercial vehicle 
sales and growth in the energy sector, along with cost cutting, were behind the surge in profits, said Hakan 
Samuelsson, chief executive.

Ryanair, the leading European low-cost airline, increased its first quarter pre-tax profit by 67 per cent to a record 
Euros 128.6m (Pounds 87.9m), but warned that it faced difficult trading this winter due to a big increase in capacity 
and the high oil price.
It said that if oil prices remained above Dollars 74 a barrel it could make a loss in its final quarter from January to 
March 2007, a period that it still had no protective fuel hedges in place.
Ryanair expects to announce a deal next month for the in-flight use of mobile phones with the service becoming 
operational in July next year. Online gambling via its website, a new source of commissions, is also expected to be 
launched in September.
Despite the group's "bumper" first quarter, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said net profit for the full year 
was still expected to rise by only 5 to 10 per cent with average fares likely to fall by 5 to 10 per cent in the second 
half from October to March.
Almost all of the airline's profit will be generated during the first half of the financial year from April to September. 
The Ryanair share price closed 27 cents lower at Euros 7.51.
"We think that the company could be crying wolf," said Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JP Morgan. "The winter 
warning is the third consecutive year that Ryanair has been cautious."
The carrier was expected to be one of the two winners along with EasyJet in the European open skies market in 
terms of long-term shareholder value creation, he said, given its "size, brand, first-mover advantage, lowest costs, 
highest margins, cheapest Boeings and a strong net cash balance".
In the first quarter net profits rose from Euros 69.4m to Euros 115.7m, while adjusted net profits, excluding a Euros 
5.2m settlement of an insurance claim a year ago, rose from Euros 64.4m to Euros 115.7m.
Passenger volumes rose to 10.7m, while turnover rose by 40 per cent to Euros 567m.
Ryanair warns of winter chill TRAVEL & LEISURE
Ryanair is one of the world's most profitable airlines and achieved a 20.4 per cent net profit margin in the first 
quarter up from 17.2 per cent a year ago.
It said its strong performance in the three months from April to June was due chiefly to a big rise in its average 
fares, or yields, by 13 per cent from Euros 41 to Euros 46, although yields for the full year were forecast to rise by 
only 1 per cent.
The jump in first quarter yields was due in part to rising fuel surcharges at many rival airlines, which was driving 
more traffic to the Irish carrier.
Mr O'Leary said the group was planning to announce two more bases for launch in early 2007. It has been 
allocated slots for the winter schedule at Madrid Barajas airport, which could become its second Spanish base.

Two years ago, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's famously forthright chief executive, forecast a winter "bloodbath" for the 
airline industry. The bloodbath failed to materialise, but the Irish carrier's propensity for pessimistic predictions 
remains intact. Yesterday, it announced first quarter results that were significantly better than expected. It also said 
yields would fall by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent in the second half, and profitability would decline sharply.
Whether such gloom is justified is a moot point. It is also irritating for investors, who are constantly told jam today 
does not mean jam tomorrow. And the first quarter figures certainly look pretty jammy. Passenger numbers were up 
25 per cent, while revenues rose 40 per cent. Ancillary revenues - from services like car hire - continued to rise 
faster than overall traffic, and net margins were an industry-beating 20 per cent.
So why the caution? Geopolitics and the oil price are genuine concerns. Passengers are already showing signs of 
bypassing countries such as Turkey in favour of "safer" western European destinations. Meanwhile, although 
Ryanair has hedged its fuel needs until the end of the year at between Dollars 70 and Dollars 74 a barrel, it is 
currently unhedged thereafter. Other potential problems are more home-grown. The airline is adding new capacity 
to its 107-strong fleet at a breakneck pace - 27 new aircraft by March 2007, and another 30 the year after.
Investors may question how Ryanair's management can talk about the opacity of future demand while embarking 
on a spending spree. The more Machiavellian might even argue that it provides the airline with an excuse not to 
return some of its large cash pile to shareholders. Preserving cash in an uncertain world makes sense, of course. 
But it would not hurt if Ryanair started predicting nice surprises - like a special dividend - rather than just nasty 
ones.

Ryanair 1Q profit surges despite higher fuel costs
Ryanair 1Q profit surges despite higher fuel costs

Ryanair Holdings PLC announced Tuesday that its first-quarter profit surged by 66 percent thanks to higher 
average fares and its expanding route network, but warned of tougher times ahead because of high fuel costs.
Europe's biggest budget airline said it earned 115.7 million euros ($147.3 million) for the quarter ending June 30 
compared with 69.6 million euros in the same quarter of 2005.
Sales rose 40 percent to 566.6 million euros ($721.3 million) from 404.6 million euros a year earlier.
The figures were significantly better than analysts' forecasts. But Ryanair's unexpectedly downbeat prediction of a 
difficult winter rattled investors, who sent its shares down 3.2 percent to close at 7.54 euros ($9.62) on the Irish 
Stock Exchange.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary attributed the strong growth in part to Ryanair's provision this year of "many more 
`sun' destinations, the impact of competitors' fuel surcharges, which continue to drive traffic towards Ryanair ... and 
the earlier launch of our new bases and routes, much of which took place in the fourth quarter last year."
Ryanair carried 25 percent more passengers, and the average cost of a ticket rose 13 percent to 46 euros ($58.50). 
About 84 percent of seats were filled, a one-point gain from the first quarter of 2005. The higher numbers partly 
reflected that the busy Easter holiday fell in the first quarter this year. Easter fell in the fourth quarter of 2004, 
depressing the first-quarter 2005 figure.
O'Leary warned that exceptionally high fuel costs would increasingly bite into Ryanair profits this year, particularly in 
the lower-traffic fourth quarter from January to March 2007.
"Our outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year remains cautious," O'Leary said. "As we emphasized at the time of 
our full-year results in June, we expected a bumper set of first-quarter results, and a strong second quarter, but we 
believe that the forthcoming winter will be characterized by much more difficult trading conditions."
Ryanair 1Q profit surges despite higher fuel costs
Ryanair said its first-quarter fuel costs rose 52 percent to 167.5 million euros ($213.2 million), a period when it 
purchased advance contracts for aviation fuel at the equivalent of $70 a barrel. The airline forecast it would fall into 
red ink in the fourth quarter if fuel rose above $74 a barrel, the price secured for its fuel supplies through November.
Oil was trading near $75 a barrel Tuesday.
"We have the fourth quarter unhedged," said Howard Millar, Ryanair's deputy chief executive. "When your biggest 
single cost is rising by 50 percent, it does create problems for your business."
The Dublin-based company founded in 1985 with a single route linking London to the southeast Irish city of 
Waterford has 3,700 employees and operates 351 routes to 23 countries across Europe.

Ryanair Holdings PLC announced Tuesday that its first-quarter net profit surged by 66 percent thanks to higher 
average fares and its expanding route network, but warned of tougher times ahead because of high fuel costs.
Europe's biggest budget airline said net profit for the quarter ending June 30 was â¬115.7 million (US$147.3 million) 
compared with â¬69.6 million in the same quarter of 2005. Sales rose 40 percent to â¬566.6 million (US$721.3 
million) from â¬404.6 million a year earlier.
The figures were significantly better than analysts' forecasts. But Ryanair's unexpectedly downbeat prediction of a 
difficult winter rattled investors, who sent its shares down 1.9 percent to â¬7.64 (US$9.73) on the Irish Stock 
Exchange in an otherwise upbeat market.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary attributed the strong growth in part to Ryanair's provision this year of "many more 
`sun' destinations, the impact of competitors' fuel surcharges, which continue to drive traffic towards Ryanair ... and 
the earlier launch of our new bases and routes, much of which took place in the fourth quarter last year."

Shares on the Dublin market closed marginally higher today but well of session highs as investors pocketed profits 
following a slow start on Wall Street.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 19.68 points higher on 7526.86
At one stage today, shares were up over 100 points after AIB posted a strong trading update for the first six months 
of the year and Elan issued an improved second quarter performance, however, investors pocketed much of those 
gains in late afternoon trading.
 Investors also pulled back following a sluggish start on Wall Street amid heightened fears of inflation as a key price 
index climbed to an 11-year high and an improving manufacturing sector raised the likelihood of another interest 
rate hike by the Federal Reserve. The Fed meets next Tuesday to gauge whether more interest rate hikes are 
needed to clamp down on inflation. Analysts said that today's reports could push policy makers toward another 
quarter percentage point increase, which would put the benchmark rate at 5.5pc. That would make capital more 
expensive for corporations and hurt corporate earnings and share prices. 'The market is trying to read every tea leaf 
to gauge where the Fed is going to go. You're going to see these kind of movements, up and down, before you get 
to the Fed meeting,' said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Wachovia Securities. Dealer sentiment was not 
helped either by a fresh spike in oil prices as energy traders kept an eye on supply threats ranging from a tropical 
storm in the Caribbean to fighting in the Middle East. Back in Dublin, the financials were in the black today, with AIB 
leading the way after it posted strong first half profits of E1.214bn - up a massive 47pc on the year. Shares in the 
bank were up 29c to 1922. Elsewhere, Bank of Ireland was up 16c to 1396, while Anglo Irish Bank gained 1c to 
1143. Irish Life and Permanent gained 10c to 1815. Construction stocks were mixed, with CRH unchanged on 
2520, Grafton up, 35c to 1032 and McInerney down 7c to 1078. Kingspan tacked on 10c to close on 1309. Shares 
in Ryanair fell after the no-frills airline warned of a tough winter ahead amid rising oil prices. It issued the warning 
despite posting a much stronger than expected 80pc jump in first quarter net income. The airline reported net profit 
AIB leads ISEQ marginally higher
of E115.7m for the three months to the end of June, above consensus of E98m. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary 
said in a statement that he believes the 'forthcoming winter will be characterised by much more difficult trading 
conditions' and reiterated that he expected net profit to rise 5 to 10pc for the full year. Shares closed 21c lower 
today on 758. Elan was another notable faller, slipping 3c to1169. Shares in the company shot up by more than 40c 
in morning deals after it posted narrowing second-quarter losses and said it is 'confident' the revenues from re-
launched Tysabri will drive the group's return to profitability. The group's share price slipped back later in the day, 
however, as investors pocketed profits. Other notable movers included ICON, which fell 110c to 4990, Kerry Group, 
down 15c to 1565 and Paddy Power, up 23c to 1330.

No frills-airline Ryanair has warned that it faces a "very difficult winter" amid rising oil prices.
Despite posting record profits for the first quarter of the year yesterday, chief executive Michael O'Leary cautioned 
that figures for the second quarter and for the second half of the year are likely to be down.
Mr O'Leary warned that the Dublin-based airline could even make a loss during the winter months due to difficult 
trading conditions and volatile fuel prices.
 The warning came despite the airline yesterday announcing that profits for the three months to the end of June 
soared 80pc to E115.7m. Analysts had forecast a profit of E98m. The airline said that the growth was a result of 
higher fares, increased passenger numbers and a late Easter. It also pointed to an increase in the number of "sun" 
destinations offered and the impact of competitors fuel surcharges which continue to drive traffic towards Ryanair. 
The company's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said: "Our outlook for the fiscal year remains cautious. We believe 
that the forthcoming winter will be characterised by much more difficult trading conditions." Meanwhile, total 
revenues surged by 40pc to E566.6m, with unit costs, excluding fuel, falling by 2pc (including fuel they rose by 6pc). 
Mr O'Leary said that fuel continues to be a concern for Ryanair, as it is for all airlines. He said that although it has 
been able to hedge 90pc of oil prices at USD74 for November and December, no price has been agreed for the 
opening months of 2007. The figures for the first quarter show that fuel costs rose sharply by 52pc to E167.5m, with 
the airline commenting that prices remain "high and volatile." Mr O'Leary warned that should prices go far beyond 
USD74 per barrel then the company will likely make a loss in first three months of next year - January to March. 
The group said that traffic soared by 25pc to 10.7 million passengers during the quarter, whist yields (the amount of 
money made on each passenger) rose by 13pc - well ahead of forecasts. The percentage of seats filled also 
increased to 84pc - up 1pc on the same period last year. Despite average fares, or yields, rising by 13pc in the first 
quarter, the company said that it expected average fares, or yields, to fall in the remainder of the year. "We would 
caution, based on advanced bookings, that we do not expect this yield buoyancy to be maintained at similar levels 
Ryanair predicts "very difficult winter"
during the second quarter or indeed the second half of the fiscal year". Mr O'Leary also welcomed the takeover of 
BAA by the Spanish construction firm Ferrovial, as well as the news that the Office of Fair Trading is to launch an 
investigation into BAA's ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. "Real competition between these 
three airports will lead to lower airport charges and better facilities for passengers," the company said, "and Ryanair 
will continue to strongly campaign for the break-up of the BAA airport monopoly, which has for many years 
delivered high passenger charges and abysmal facilities at the London airports." Meanwhile, Mr O'Leary also said 
that Ryanair will announce the opening of two new bases in the coming months, with several new routes also in the 
pipeline. At 1615, shares in Ryanair were down 29c to 750.

Dublin's High Court has ordered Ryanair to pay legal costs amounting to over ?1 million ($1.3 million) to two pilot 
unions following a judge's decision to dismiss the Irish carrier's request to identify certain pilots who had posted 
anonymous comments on a union-hosted website.
The ruling follows legal action taken by Ryanair against the British Air Line Pilots Association (BALPA) and the Irish 
Air Line Pilots Association (IALPA), in which the carrier sought to identify the names of some of its pilots involved in 
anonymously posting comments on the Ryanair European Pilots Association (REPA) website established by the 
two unions in 2004. 
BALPA says the REPA website was launched to enable Ryanair pilots to exchange views on the carrier's move to 
make individual pilots responsible for repaying the ?15,000 training costs associated with the operation of larger 
Boeing 737-800s in the event that the airline enters union negotiations within five years.
Ryanair says it took legal action to identify "three individuals who made anonymous postings on the REPA website 
advocating threats, including slashing car tyres, against specific Ryanair employees who had accepted posts in 
Dublin".
It adds: "Had Ryanair not taken action to identify and prevent the publication of these threats, Ryanair may have 
been accused of allowing its employees to be bullied or intimidated by these pilot trade union activists."
BALPA claims that Justice Thomas Smyth dismissed Ryanair's request because the evidence surrounding it was 
"baseless and false". Union chairman Mervyn Granshaw adds: "The judge's comments that the management style 
of Ryanair bears all the hallmarks of oppression were spot on and should sound another warning to governments, 
regulators, investors and the travelling public."
Ryanair says the carrier is "disappointed" with the High Court ruling, and is considering appealing against the 
decision.

Higher fuel bills make record-breaking Ryanair cautious for second half
Higher fuel bills make record-breaking Ryanair cautious for second half

A cautious view of the future is taken by Europe's number one budget airline, despite making record profits in the 
first quarter.
With a 25% increase to 10.7 million passengers in the three months to 30 June, 2.2 million more than the same 
2005 period, and yields up 13%, Ryanair made adjusted net profits of 115.7 million, up by a record 80% from 64.4 
million last time.
Although a record first quarter was strongly signalled when the preliminary results were revealed in June, the size of 
the rise is still greater than the market anticipated. The shares fell 2.22%, by 0.173 to 7.608.
But chief executive Michael O'Leary says that after looking at the advanced bookings he does not expect this yield 
buoyancy to be maintained at similar levels during the second quarter or indeed the second half of the fiscal year. If 
oil prices go over $74 a barrel Ryanair could even make a loss in the fourth quarter, he says.
Ryanair (RYA) is adding 27 aircraft this winter, new routes and bases, but O'Leary thinks trading will be difficult 
because of increased capacity, fuel charges of $74 a barrel instead of the forecast $70, and price dumping by loss-
making competitors.
Even so he expects the company to increase its net profit after tax for the year by between 5-10%, but says almost 
all the profit will be generated in the first half.
'The underlying causes of these stronger first quarter yields was primarily the presence of Easter in the quarter, and 
its absence from the prior year comparable, many more "sun" destinations, the impact of competitors fuel 
surcharges, which continue to drive traffic towards Ryanair, the initial impact of our baggage charging initiative, and 
the earlier launch of our new bases and routes, much of which took place in the fourth quarter last year' he said.
A 31% increase in ancillary revenue helped push turnover up by 40% to 566.6 million against 404.6 million last 
time.
O'Leary says that after stimulating increased traffic with lower fares, passengers are more willing to spend money 
on car hire, hotels and travel insurance. During the quarter Ryanair exercised its option for the delivery of ten further 
Boeing 737-800 series aircraft in 2008 which will help it keep down future aircraft operating costs.
Higher fuel bills make record-breaking Ryanair cautious for second half
Costs overall rose 6%, but this is entirely due to a 52% increase in fuel costs of 167.5 million. If fuel is excluded 
from the overall costs, they came down 2%, much of it due to increased on-line check-ins and priority boarding 
arrangements for passengers travelling with hand luggage.
'Fuel prices continue to be high and volatile' added O'Leary. 'We have recently extended our hedging position, so 
that we are 90% hedged to the end of October at $70 per barrel and 90% hedged for November and December at 
$74 per barrel'.
Ryanair is currently unhedged for the January to March 2007 quarter, but is looking for an opportunity to change 
this if and when the futures markets move favourably.
Excluded from the adjusted profit figure is 5.2 million received net of tax from the settlement of an insurance claim 
for the scribing of six Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
The increase in profitability boosted cash balances by 212.4 million to 2.18 billion which lifted the profit margin after 
tax by four points to 20%.
Now that the Ferrovial consortium has taken over BAA, the Spanish group is reviewing the plans for Stansted and 
O'Leary hopes 'that a second runway and terminal can be built at a more realistic cost of Â£1 billion, rather than the 
Â£4 billion gold-plated Taj Mahal proposed by the BAA airport monopoly'.
O'Leary also welcomes the Office of Fair Trading enquiry into the monopoly ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and 
Stansted.
'Monopolies don't work and don't serve the needs of consumers' he said. 'Real competition between these three 
airports will lead to lower airport charges and better facilities for passengers, and Ryanair will continue to strongly 
campaign for the break-up of the BAA airport monopoly, which has for many years delivered high passenger 
charges and abysmal facilities at the London airports'.

Aer Lingus today confirmed it is to charge customers to check-in luggage on its short haul routes.
The airline said that a E4 per bag fee will apply to bags booked in advance on the Aer Lingus website, while those 
deciding they wish to check their luggage in at the airport will face a charge of E8 per bag.
The charges will come into effect on short-haul routes for bookings made after August 8 for travel after January 17 
2007, the airline said.
 Short-haul passengers will be allowed 20kg for checked-in baggage, with an allowance of 36kg for passengers on 
long-haul routes. Charges for excess baggage will remain at E8 per kilo for luggage above these amounts. Aer 
Lingus is the latest airline to add on such charges after Ryanair did so earlier this year. Ryanair charges customers 
E3.50 per bag, per flight if booked online or E7 per bag at the airport. Aer Lingus said it is also introducing web 
check-in from early December 2006 and will allow passengers to check in up to 24 hours before their scheduled 
flight.

Body
Low-cost carrier, Ryanair, this morning posted record net profits that rose by 80pc in the first quarter to E115.7m as 
traffic soared by 25pc to 10.7 million passengers.
It said that yields (the amount of money made on each passenger) rose by 13pc - well ahead of forecasts - while 
ancillary revenues climbed by 31pc.
Total revenues surged by 40pc to E566.6m.
 Unit costs excluding fuel fell by 2pc (including fuel they rose by 6pc) as fuel costs rose by 52pc to E167.5m. 
Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said the "exceptional" results reflect a much 
stronger yield environment despite substantially higher oil prices. "We would caution however, based on advanced 
bookings, that we do not expect this yield buoyancy to be maintained at similar levels during the second quarter or 
indeed the second half of the fiscal year," he said.

Shares on the Dublin market picked up today where they left off on Friday as hopes of a cease fire in the Middle 
East increased.
At 1230, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 33.91 points to 7535.20.
Hopes of peace in the Middle East were sparked after Israel agreed to a 48-hour halt to its aerial bombardment of 
Lebanon.
 There is now optimism that an agreement to end the deadly conflict between the Jewish state and Hezbollah 
militants will be agreed soon. Back in Dublin, the financials were mostly in the red, with AIB up 12c to 1896, while 
Bank of Ireland gained 6c to 1406 and Irish Life and Permanent tacked on 31c to 1811. Anglo Irish Banks bucked 
the trend falling 2c to 1143. Construction stocks were little changed, however, CRH did managed to add 20c to 
2555, while Grafton was up 1c to 998. Trading was sluggish elsewhere in the sector however, with both McInerney 
and Kingspan unchanged. Other notable movers included DCC, whose shares slipped 15c to 1895, Elan, falling 
11c to 1144 and Kerry Group, down 10c to 1570. Paddy Power was trading well, up 18cto 1316, while Ryanair

Financial and construction stocks led the Dublin market 85 points higher today taking the ISEQ back to within sight 
of the 7500 level.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 85.25 points higher on 7479.89.
Investor sentiment was also lifted by a firm start on Wall Street after a report from the Federal Reserve on 
Wednesday suggested that the US economy was slowing and that interest rates could soon peak.
 In its Beige Book, the Fed, which has raised its key Fed funds rate a quarter point on 17 consecutive occasions to 
5.25pc, said growth in the US was moderating at the same time as wage pressures remained benign. The report 
was interpreted as reducing the likelihood that the Fed will hike interest rates at its meeting on August 8. Markets 
are now discounting a 34pc probability that the Fed will not hike again any time soon. Meanwhile, the European 
Central Bank is widely forecast to raise its key interest rate next week to 3pc from 2.75pc. Analysts then expect at 
least one more rate hike before the end of the year. In Dublin today, AIB led the way in the financial sector, climbing 
27c to 1877, while Irish Life and Permanent was up 30c to 1795 and Bank of Ireland tacked on 25c to 1385. Anglo 
Irish Bank was also in the black, adding on 2c to close at 1146. It was a similar story in the construction sector, with 
all leading stocks closing in positive territory. CRH led the way, climbing 42c to 2542, while Grafton tacked on 5c to 
986. Kingspan was also up 7c to 1307, as was McInerney, which climbed 15c to 1100. ICON enjoyed sharp gains 
again today climbing over 8pc for the second consecutive day after the contract clinical research group reported 
strong second quarter profits and raised its full year revenue forecast earlier in the week. The Dublin-based firm 
said that second quarter net revenues increased 25pc during the second quarter to USD107.4 million. The firm also 
raised its full year revenue forecast from USD425m to USD440m. Shares in the company closed 391c higher on 
5109. Shares in Ryanair were up 8c to 788 after the no-frills airline welcomed the news that the EU is set to launch

Cheapflights is a resolutely modest company. A dotcom with no smoothies or beanbags in its offices and a name 
that is useful but adds no pizazz, the flight-comparison site hails not from Silicon Valley but a London attic.
It is also distinguished from most of its peers in another respect: Cheapflights has been profitable since before the 
dotcom boom and throughout the messy aftermath. Its owners plan next year either to float it on the stockmarket, 
accept an injection of private capital or find a buyer. The price tag is likely to be in excess of Pounds 200m.
The story of the UK site - which is expanding fast in the US and plans to launch on continental Europe next year - 
shows how careful adherence to a trusted business model and a parsimony untypical of internet start-ups can spell 
the difference between success and failure.
Cheapflights was launched in 1996 by John Hatt, then travel editor of Harpers & Queen, the fashion magazine. With 
a career spent mainly in travel journalism, Mr Hatt's knowledge of the industry proved useful, even if he was not a 
natural entrepreneur.
Four years later he handed over to someone who wanted to trade in a lucrative day job for the buzz of running his 
own business.
As head of media mergers and acquisitions at ABN Amro, David Soskin had witnessed the dotcom phenomenon up 
close. When Cheapflights came across his desk in 2000, he decided to stop advising his clients on what to buy and 
take the plunge himself. "A lot of my business school contemporaries were all getting sucked into internet activities: 
I thought it was incredibly exciting," he says.
What he found was an operation based in the attic of Mr Hatt's house, where the founder had built up 300,000 
unique users a month and an annual turnover of Pounds 400,000. Revenues came from 70 advertisers buying 
spots beside the unbiased results brought up by those searching for deals.
A start-up that took to the skies Cheapflights survived the dotcom boom and bust. Now the UK travel 
comparison website is expanding in the US , says Tom Braithw....
But Mr Hatt had had enough. "He was absolutely exhausted by this time," says Mr Soskin, speaking from the 
company's modest offices in central London. "It was basically him and his personal assistant doing all the work."
Selling near the top of the market left Mr Hatt with sufficient funds to satisfy his love of travel. Mr Soskin and his 
business partner, Hugo Burge, paid a full price but Cheapflights weathered the bursting of the dotcom bubble and 
stayed in profit.
Today, the site attracts more than 5m bargain-seeking travellers a month. Last year's turnover reached Pounds 
12.2m and the company estimates turnover of Pounds 18m this year as the business continues to grow at 50-60 
per cent a year.
Cheapflights' rise coincided with the birth of UK budget airlines, such as EasyJet and Ryanair, bringing to public 
attention the benefits of shopping around for business or leisure flights. Mr Soskin sees liberalisation of the skies as 
a key growth factor. "The more deregulation there is, the better it is for our business," he says.
Then there is the name. Unlike other travel companies such as Travelocity or Expedia, Cheapflights has been able 
to minimise its advertising spending owing to the simplicity of its brand and the fact that it can be found easily on 
search engines. It has spent just over Pounds 100,000 on marketing in the UK since 1996.
Fortunately for Cheapflights, airlines and travel agents have not been so abstemious. In the site's relationship with 
advertisers, though, Mr Soskin has taken a cautious approach, anxious not to betray the values of an unbiased 
information service established by his predecessor. "Because we're from a journalistic heritage, this neutrality is 
terribly important. The John Hatt philosophy was if you create a site that is good for users you will make money."
In 2000 Mr Soskin took the crucial decision to place sponsored links alongside search results - the pay-per-click 
advertising model made famous by Google. He says he was "terribly nervous" about giving the impression of 
polluting the results, but decided to follow the market leader. "We all know Google is not evil: Google's good. So we 
thought Cheapflights could be good, too."
Some of the advertisers were less keen. After the number of leads sent to one advertiser doubled, Mr Soskin told 
the client he would raise his prices by 20 per cent. "They said we've been advertising in traditional media for years 
and no one has ever done that."
Nevertheless, he says, about half of the travel agents and airlines that advertise with the site were pleased with the 
concept. The others were forced into it over time after the company dropped alternative means of advertising. Yet 
some independent travel agents have seen their revenues increase dramatically thanks to traffic generated from the 
site.
This made the company particularly upset when the Association of British Travel Agents, an industry body, ran a 
"Dotcom = Dotcon" advertising campaign in 2001, which attempted to convince travellers to trust their money to 
bricks-and-mortar agents rather than buy tickets online. "I took exception to it and went and explained that we were 
keeping their members in business," says Mr Soskin.
In conversation, he is level headed, sometimes downbeat. "We always feel dissatisfied with our product," he says. 
He says users complain about having to wade through too much data: a search for flights between London and 
Paris returns about 50 options, from Pounds 39 to nearly 10 times as much. The site's designers plan to streamline 
the technology and improve its layout.
Geographic expansion is now the order of the day. Yet it was only made possible by a pivotal decision Mr Hatt took 
several years earlier. Not blessed with vast reserves of cash, he agonised over whether to spend Pounds 1,500 on 
the cheapflights.com domain name to complement cheapflights.co.uk. He made the investment and the invoice is 
now framed in the company's boardroom.
A start-up that took to the skies Cheapflights survived the dotcom boom and bust. Now the UK travel 
comparison website is expanding in the US , says Tom Braithw....
Without the ".com" doÃâÃÂ­main, says Mr Soskin, the expansion plans for the US would have been impossible. Even 
with it, it was a struggle. "People laughed: 'A British internet company in the States! People in Silicon Valley will run 
rings round you.' " But with little investment, Cheapflights is ranked 13th by Hitwise among US travel sites in terms 
of unique users a month. Since it provides only travel information and does not take a cut on booking fees, most 
travel sites do not see it as a direct competitor. Indeed, the top five travel sites advertise with Cheapflights.
The no-frills US expansion, led by Mr Burge, typifies the company's approach to overheads. "We did it in a typical 
Cheapflights way, moving a couple of people over from London and renting an office in northern Boston rather than 
splurging our cash."
Next year the company will launch sites in continental Europe. As always, Mr Soskin insists, the entrance into these 
new markets will not be flashy. "Hugo is going to start taking some Berlitz lessons in French, in German and 
Italian."

Ryanair has announced plans to axe current services from the west of Ireland to London.
The low fares airline will cut services between Shannon and Knock airports to Luton and Gatwick on October 31.
The news came as the airline also unveiled two new routes from Shannon to Bournemouth and Edinburgh, and 
more flights between Dublin and Cork and Dublin and London Gatwick.
 "Ryanair's Shannon base has performed strongly this summer and has firmly established itself as an important 
driver of both tourism and business in the west of Ireland," said Ryanair's Peter Sherrard. "Today's new route

No- frills airline Ryanair has welcomed the EU Commission's announcement yesterday of an enquiry into flights 
between Italy's mainland and Sardinia and what it perceives as the abuse of public service obligation (PSO) rules to 
block competition from low fare airlines and protect high fare Italian airlines.
On May 2, the Italian authorities blocked Ryanair and Easyjet from offering low fare flights on 16 routes between 
mainland Italy and Sardinia.
Ryanair head of communications Peter Sherrard today said, 'Sardinian consumers and visitors are being ripped off, 
denied choice and paying fares 4 times higher than Ryanair's, solely as a result of the unlawful actions of the Italian 
authorities to block Ryanair's flights and permit the routes to be taken over by high fare Italian airlines.
'We hope the EU investigation will be completed quickly and Ryanair's low fares restored to the Sardinian routes.'

Icon led the Dublin market marginally higher today after it reported strong second quarter profits and raising its 
revenue forecast for the rest of the year.
The ISEQ closed 4.51 points higher at 7394.64.
Gains on the market were capped however as stocks on Wall Street fell moderately due to profit taking after two 
days of gains. Markets remain cautious as fighting continues in the Middle East and as oil prices continue to 
fluctuate.
 Investors in the US also remain slightly anxious over earnings season, however, they are much more nervous 
about the meeting of the Federal Reserve on 8 August, which could bring the 18th straight increase in the fed funds 
rate, the nation's benchmark interest rate. The markets are hoping that the Fed will then put its rate hike program 
on hold. Fed chief Ben Bernanke hinted last week that a end to the rate hiking cycle was close, however, 
speculation since then has suggested that there may still be one rate rise left. There was no doubt which share was 
the star performer today as shares in contract clinical research group ICON soared more than 8pc, or 345c, to 
47.11 after the firm reported strong second quarter profits and raised its full year revenue forecast. The Dublin-
based firm said that second quarter net revenues increased 25pc over the comparative quarter to May 31, 2005, to 
USD107.4 million, prompting the firm to raise its forecast for revenue to USD425 to USD440 million for 2006 as a 
whole. The financials endured a mixed day. AIB closed up 16c at 1856 and Bank of Ireland was 9c higher on 1372, 
however, Anglo Irish Bank slipped 10c to 1135, while Irish Life and Permanent was unchanged on 1765. 
Construction stocks had a difficult day, with Grafton the worst of the fallers, down 13c to 981. CRH was also in the 
red, closing 2c lower on 2513, while Kingspan fell 5c to 1303. McInerney managed to buck the trend, up 10c to 
1095. Elsewhere, Elan was in the black, soaring 36c to 1130, after confirming earlier in the week the prices for its 
multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri. The prices were much higher than previously forecast. The Irish drug firm also 
received a boost after Biogen Idec, its US partner of Tysabri, posted better-than-expected adjusted second-quarter 
Buoyant ICON fails to lift sluggish ISEQ
results. Shares in Ryanair were unchanged on 780 after the no-frills airline confirmed a series of new routes. The 
airline has added two new routes from Shannon to Bournemouth and Edinburgh, while a sixth daily flight was added 
on its Dublin to Gatwick service. It also said it is adding a fourth daily frequency on its Cork to Dublin service. 
Eircom was down 1c to 218 after shareholders gave their overwhelming backing to a takeover approach from 
Australian investment firm Babcock and Brown at a meeting in Dublin. The deal means that Eircom has now 
changed hands four times in the last six years. Elsewhere, shares in C and C were down 4c to 831, while Fyffes 
slipped 3c to 137 and Greencore fell 4c to 414.

losses.
Body
Construction and financial shares led the Dublin market sharply higher today, erasing most of Friday's heavy losses 
following a solid start to trading on Wall Street and falling oil prices.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 69.87 at 7450.72.
Shares suffered heavy losses on Friday, with the ISEQ closing down almost 90 points.
 Investors were buoyed by a dip in oil prices as US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made a surprise stop in 
Beirut for talks with Lebanese leaders on the worsening conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, calling for an 'urgent' 
cease-fire in the deadly conflict. The falls today mean that oil prices have lost some 8pc since striking record highs 
above USD78 a barrel last week on hopes the crisis will not spill over into a wider regional conflict, nor drag in 
major crude producer Iran. Bank of Ireland analyst Paul Harris said prices had eased further 'on foot of the growing 
diplomatic efforts centred around the Israeli/Hezbollah conflict'. Back in Dublin, the financials led the way, with AIB 
up 37c to 1874, while Anglo Irish Bank added on 22c to 1155 and Irish Life and Permanent tacked on 5c to 1755. 
Bank of Ireland was up 11c to 1389 after it restructured staff at its troubled investment arm Bank of Ireland Asset 
Management (BIAM) in a bid to 'accelerate a turnaround in our performance'. BoI also announced plans to hire a 
further 18 new staff in the coming weeks. Grafton was the star performer in the construction sector, climbing 30c to 
1010. CRH also made modest progress, trading 20c higher at 2530, while Kingspan tacked on 15c to 1320 and 
McInerney added 5c to 1088. C and C was another stock in the black, up 6c to 826, while shares in insurance firm 
DCC climbed 5c to 1890. Ryanair slipped 5c to 775 after it was confirmed that the no-frills airline will have to pay up 
to E1m in costs after the High Court dismissed its application seeking disclosure of the identities of pilots using a 
Website set up by the Ryanair European Pilot's Association. Ryanair argued that some of their pilots had been 
intimidated by postings by anonymous individuals using code names such as 'I hate Ryanair'. After hearing 
submissions, the judge said he had no doubt that all the costs should be awarded to the pilots associations against

Ryanair. Shares in pharmaceutical group Elan were down 22 at 1048 after its troubled flagship multiple sclerosis 
drug, Tysabri, was launched on the US market today. Tysabri is now available in the U.S. 17 months after the 
companies pulled the drug from pharmacies. In June, the Food and Drug Administration re-approved the drug with 
certain restrictions. FBD Holdings was the days biggest loser, falling 40c to 3680, while shares in Dragon Oil were 
also in negative territory, down 5c to 415. Shares in UTV were unchanged at 485 despite speculation that the group 
is mulling a E439 million bid for Scottish Media Group. UTV was close to bidding for SMG two years ago but exited 
the scene after the Scottish company's share price rose too high. However, SMG's stock has been weaker of late, 
declining by 40pc since 2004.

application seeking disclosure of the identities of pilots using a Website set up by the Ryanair European Pilot's

Ryanair argued that some of their pilots had been intimidated by postings by anonymous individuals using code

After hearing submissions, the judge said he had no doubt that all the costs should be awarded to the pilots 
associations against Ryanair.
 Mr Justice Smyth said his conclusion on costs was firm and refused to put a stay on the costs order in the event of 
a Ryanair appeal to the Supreme Court. Mr Justice Tom Smith said that there was no evidence of bullying by 
defendants to the action and that the only evidence of bullying was by Ryanair itself.

Body
The concept of the masterclass, originally confined to the musical register, has always lent itself to liberal 
interpretation. Nowadays you can find masterclasses in practically anything - golf, ballet, sustainability, even particle 
physics.
For Rory and Minette Constant, a British couple who made the move from the UK to south-west France almost 20 
years ago, the idea of offering wine masterclasses seemed a logical option.
Minette's references were impeccable. After completing a winemaking course at the local Lycee Viticole 
(winemaking school), working in a vineyard and setting up as a wine broker, in 1997 she became a Master of Wine, 
one of about 250 people worldwide to have passed this ferociously demanding, British-based wine qualification. 
Together the Constants found the ideal location for their new venture, an ochre-washed, 17th-century chateau set 
in the gentle Bearnais countryside, with views from the terrace of the snow-capped Pyrenees. They were dealt a 
trump card when Ryanair began operating a daily flight from London to Pau, 20 minutes from the chateau.
So was born Tastevin du Monde, which offers tailor-made, top-end short breaks for groups with a focus on wine 
appreciation. Granted observer status recently, I joined one.
Typically, a group will have varying levels of wine expertise and interest. Ours (featuring, among others, an artist, a 
soldier-turned-security-chief, an IT expert, a resting chef and a wine grower) was no exception. The first session 
was thus to be pitched at beginner/intermediate level, with a more advanced approach for the second.
We each received a clipboard and a printed list of the wines. In front of us, a flight of glasses was gracefully 
arranged, V-shaped, like geese on the wing. There was a tactful reminder that there would be eight wines and two 
champagnes to compare (before we even got anywhere near dinner). We could, of course, drink the wine if we 
wished, or we could use the elegant black spittoons provided.
All in disgracefully good taste Sue Style takes a wine masterclass with a little more luxury thrown in courtesy of 
the scenery and food of south-western France
We started with pairs of wines from the same grape variety, so we could get a handle on what each cepage (vine 
variety) had to offer and try to identify and memorise common traits. We got our noses around a pair of Chenin 
Blancs first, one from South Africa, one - a Savennieres - from the Loire. Next came two Sauvignon Blancs, one 
from the Loire again, another from New Zealand. With glasses tilted against the white damask tablecloth, we began 
to pick up nuances of colour ranging from pale straw to greenish yellow to deep honeyed gold. Most striking of all, 
with both Chenin and Sauvignon Blanc, were the differences between the Old World version and the New World 
one - different traditions, climate, soil, explained Minette, even different clones of what is ostensibly the same grape.
By the time we progressed to the pairs of reds (Pinot Noir, Syrah) we were beginning to warm to our subject, 
exchanging ideas on what the aroma suggested ("strawberries", "tea leaves", "rotting vegetation") and how they 
tasted ("classic Pinot", "high acidity", "quite tannic").
After a pair of champagnes taken on the terrace (too good to spit out), we set off for supper at the ferme-auberge in 
the neighbouring village. The patronne appeared, drying her hands on her apron. She proposed home-made foie 
gras with salad, followed by grilled duck breast and roast duckling, all from the farm, including her famous pommes 
de terre. It was all disgracefully good.
Next day, the advanced tasting focused on sweet wines and posed the burning question: is it possible to make 
luscious white wines without botrytis, the so-called "noble rot" that gives fabulous complexity and long life to some 
of the world's finest naturally sweet wines? We snuffled, sucked and spat, silently making notes on a brace of 
Sauternes, an alluring Bonnezeaux from the Loire, three delectable offerings from the south-west, an extraordinary 
vin de paille from the Jura and a Hungarian Tokay. Most were botrytis-affected, all were luscious. The wild card 
came from Chateau de Cabidos with a late harvested (but nobly un-rotted), barrique-aged wine made from Petit 
Manseng, the grape responsible for the superb sweet wines of Jurancon.
We learnt our final lesson well: it's perfectly possible to make a thrilling sweet white wine without the help of the 
magnificent mould.

Shares on the Dublin market closed deep in positive territory today for the second consecutive day as investors 
remained hopeful of a pause in US interest rate hikes.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 54.69 to 7446.13.
Irish shares jumped by over 200 points on Wednesday following a speech from US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben 
Bernanke, which suggested that a string of interest rate hikes in the world's biggest economy may be nearing an 
end. Bernanke said that US economic growth seems to be moderating. Mr Bernanke's testimony to the Senate 
banking committee also included a passage about inflation cooling off as the year progressed. That was taken by 
the market to mean that the Fed's campaign of interest-rate rises is at an end.
 Investors remained positive yesterday with shares in Dublin trading in the black all day. They were also buoyed by 
figures from the Central Statistics Office showed that factory gate prices increased by 0.6pc in June compared to an 
increase of 1.6pc in June 2005. However, gains were capped as stocks on Wall Street opened lower as investors 
locked in profits following gains the previous day. In Dublin today, the financials were the biggest gainers with Bank 
of Ireland jumping 10c to 1370, after it announced on Wednesday a new management structure at its BIAM asset 
management business. The move forms part of its push to improve performance at the underperforming unit. 
Elsewhere in the sector, AIB was up 22c to 1865, while Irish Life and Permanent was up 32c to 1780. Anglo Irish 
Bank bucked the trend, down 4c to 1110. Construction stocks performed strongly, with only Grafton trading in 
negative territory, down 12cto 987. Shares in CRH shot up however, adding on 34c to 2579, while McInerney was 
4c higher at 1079 and Kingspan was up 37c to 1332. Iona Technologies was up 28c to 340 after announcing that it 
had narrowed its losses to E200,000, with a quarterly revenue growth of 27pc year-on-year. It said that revenue for 
the second quarter reached USD17.7 million. Looking ahead, the company said it expects revenue in the third 
quarter in the range of USD17.5m to USD18.5m, with total expenses to reach fall in the range of USD18.3m to 
USD18.8m. Elsewhere, Ryanair closed 25c higher at 785 after the no-frills airline announced six new routes, two 
ISEQ in the black for 2nd day running
from Glasgow and four from Frankfurt. It said it will start flights from Glasgow to Eindhoven and Riga from 31st 
October 2006, while on the same date Ryanair will also start flights from Frankfurt to Balaton, Biarritz, Nantes and 
Valencia. The airline said the new routes will result in an additional 350,000 passengers per annum across its 
network. Paddy Power tacked on 5c to trade at 1275 as another of the summers big sporting events got underway. 
Bookmakers across the UK and Ireland reported a flurry of activity as the British Open golf championship got 
underway in at Hoylake near Liverpool. Food and drink company Kerry Group was up 18c to 1578, while other 
major gainers included Irish Estates, up 13c to 343, and Trinity Biotech, up 9c to 155.

EU proposes bill to force airlines to advertise all-inclusive fares

Body
The European Commission on Tuesday proposed legislation that would force airlines to advertise fares inclusive of 
all taxes, charges and fees, sparing travelers the shock of jaw-dropping hidden costs when it is time to pay.
The EU's consumers federation BEUC hailed the move as "putting an end to misleading advertising" of the kind that 
promises cross-Europe flights for as little as â¬1 (US$1.25).
"We really welcome this initiative," said Muriel Danis, a BEUC spokeswoman, who said air fares have long 
generated consumer complaints.
David Henderson of the Association of European Airlines, which represents 31 major carriers, called it "a good thing 
for it applies to the entire industry."
The bill leaves it to airlines to set fares, but will make it easier for consumers to compare the price of tickets on 
different airlines because they have to be all-inclusive rates.
It also removes fare differences based on where a passenger lives.
In advertisements and on Web sites, airlines will have to spell out the total charge for a ticket, including if any credit 
card charges, government taxes, fuel surcharges and extra baggage fees.
"Consumers are being mislead by seemingly interesting fare offers and are only told the full fare at the moment of 
payment," the European Commission said in explaining the rationale for the bill.
The draft legislation must be endorsed by the 25 EU governments and the European Parliament to become law in 
late 2007 at the earliest.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement, "one has to ask why European air passengers will have to wait 
18 months" for the bill to take effect.
EU proposes bill to force airlines to advertise all-inclusive fares
He said all-in fares will "highlight the scandal of fuel surcharges" of his competitors adding Ryanair the Irish no-frills 
carrier that has seen spectacular growth in the last decade will never impose such charges.
The liberalization of the EU aviation sector in the past decade has increased the number of air routes by more than 
60 percent and forced prices down as new competitors appear on the market.
"Today it is generally cheaper to travel by air and more and more European citizens can afford it," EU 
Transportation Commissioner Jacques Barrot said in a statement.
But he said passengers can still run into "unclear information on fares or pricing that discriminates based on 
residence.
The bill requires airlines to charge customers the same fare no matter where they live in the EU.
EU officials say they have received numerous complaints about airlines charging different fares for exactly the 
same ticket. Most of these complaints were about Internet bookings that refused the sale when customers typed in 
their credit card numbers and home address.
The EU's push for price transparency is part of the legislative package that also aims to make it easier to lease 
aircraft and crew in the EU and harder in non-EU nations with less rigorous social and safety rules.
The Commission wants the power to be able to revoke EU operating licenses for airlines something that only 
national governments can do at the moment saying it needs to be able to step in if countries do not act.
They will also reinforce regulation to make sure airlines are not on the verge of bankruptcy and will draft clearer 
rules for airlines run as public services to isolated islands.
The EU says it will demand more information before it approves subsidized air services to make sure that this is not 
being misused to reward one airline and keep out new contenders.

Body
The European Commission on Tuesday called for a ban on air fare ads that do not spell out all the hidden extras.
The Commission says that airline ads and Web sites should list all the charges they impose including credit card 
charges, government taxes, fuel surcharges and extra baggage fees.
"Consumers are being mislead by seemingly interesting fare offers and are only told the full fare at the moment of 
payment," it said in explanatory material distributed to the media.
National flag carriers are just as guilty of this as some low-cost airlines, the Commission said, adding that 
publicizing fares this way has become a "widespread practice" that makes it difficult for air passengers to compare 
fares.
It also was insisting that customers be charged the same price no matter where they are based in the European 
Union, saying it has received numerous complaints about airlines charging different fares for exactly the same 
ticket.
Most of these complaints were about Internet bookings that refused the sale when customers typed in their credit 
card numbers and home address. EU intervention usually forced a climbdown, the Commission said, but it wants to 
make sure this cannot recur.
However, the new rules would not guarantee that the fees an airline charges covers the actual costs of a service.
Austrian MEP Eva Lichtenberger called on the Commission last week to investigate overcharging by budget airline 
Ryanair Holdings PLC, citing German media reports that these fees are higher than the actual taxes and airport 
levies Ryanair pays out. Ryanair denies these claims.
The EU's push for price transparency is only one part of the aviation package that was formally approved Tuesday.
Regulators also want to make it easier to lease aircraft in the EU and harder to do it outside the bloc. This will make 
it more difficult to lease both aircraft and crew who would not be employed under EU social and safety rules.

Construction stocks led the Dublin market marginally lower today after a volatile days trading as stocks on Wall 
Street turned lower in the face of rebounding oil prices.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed 12.84 lower on 7185.35
The market remained sluggish throughout the day, ending in the red for the fourth consecutive day.
 After closing more than 100 points lower on both Friday and Monday, the market held its breath yesterday as it 
waits to see what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has to say in his semi-annual testimony to Congress 
on Wednesday. Investors will be scrutinising his words to see whether he gives any hints regarding the future 
direction of interest rates. Mild wholesale price data, released in the US today, calmed some worries about inflation. 
The Labour Department's core producer price index - excluding volatile energy and food costs - rose 0.2pc to match 
Wall Street estimates, but investors remained cautious about a larger-than-forecast 0.5pc jump in the overall index. 
John Forelli, portfolio manager for Independence Investments, said that with so much uncertainty about global 
politics and the economy, investors were looking to the Fed for clarity on interest rates. 'It's the first time in a while I 
can remember that we were within three weeks of a Fed meeting and Fed fund futures were 50-50,' Forelli said, 
meaning the market is still divided on whether the central bank will boost interest rates at its Aug. 8 meeting. 
'Bernanke's statement could be a linchpin for a rally or continued malaise in the trading range we've seen.' In 
Dublin, construction stocks endured a difficult day. CRH closed 5c to 2475, Kingspan slipped 45c to 1255, while 
McInerney was down 40c to 1050. Grafton was down 5c to 975. However, the financials fared markedly better, with 
AIB up 15c to 1750, Irish Life and Permanent up 37c to 1742 and Bank of Ireland up 6c to 1329. It was not all good 
news for the sector however, with Anglo Irish Bank slipping 8c to 1092. Shares in outsourcing group Newcourt were 
buoyed after it was confirmed that it has agreed a E22m takeover deal for Ely Property, the Irish company which is 
listed on London's AIM market. The sale has been backed by the Ely board. Ely specialises in property 
management and facilities management in Ireland and the UK and is mainly involved in student accommodation,

pre-school learning and private healthcare. Newcourt closed 9c higher at 130. Elsewhere, Ryanair was up 14c to 
734 after it welcomed the proposals by the EU Commission to make airfares more transparent. The low cost airline 
said that all passengers who book and fly with Ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares, taxes and charges 
before they are allowed to make a booking. This comes after rules, to be outlined by the European Commission 
today, which will ban airlines using misleading advertisements for cheap tickets and would have to include all 
'hidden extras' in the price. Meanwhile, Paddy Power was down 32c to 1220, C and C group was up 5c to 750 and 
DCC slipped 4c to 1911.

Body
Shares on the Dublin market performed sluggishly this morning as the market took a breather following three days 
of heavy losses.
At midday the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 0.11 to 7198.08.
After closing 100 points lower yesterday, investors are now waiting to see what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben 
Bernanke has to say in his semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday and whether he gives any hints 
regarding interest rates.
 "Today and tomorrow are crucial for the Fed's August 8th decision, said Davy analyst Rossa White. "US producer 
prices for June are out today. Then tomorrow, the Consumer Price Index for the same month will be released in 
advance of Bernanke's salient semi-annual testimony to Congress. The "core" CPI reading may decide it: if the 
month-on-month change exceeds 0.2pc, a rate hike is likely. If not, Bernanke's speech will become even more 
important." In Dublin, the financials were the biggest gainers, with AIB up 23c to 1758, Bank of Ireland up 8c to 
1331 and Irish Life and Permanent up 20c to 1725. Anglo Irish Bank bucked the trend, falling 12c to 1088. 
Construction stocks did not fare so well however in morning exchanges. CRH was down 10c to 2470, while 
Kingspan slipped 20c to 1280 and McInerney was down 15c to 1075. Grafton was unchanged at 980. Newcourt 
made the headlines today after it announced that it has reached an agreement with Ely Property Group on the 
terms of a recommended cash offer by Newcourt valuing each Ely share at 5.6 pence for a total of about Â£15.2m. 
Newcourt said the acquisition of Ely represents an attractive entry-point into the property management market in 
Ireland and the UK. Shares in the company were up 4c to 125. Elsewhere, Ryanair was up 7c to 727 after it 
welcomed the proposals by the EU Commission to make airfares more transparent. The low cost airline said that all 
passengers who book and fly with Ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares, taxes and charges before they

Shares on the Dublin market fell by more than 100 points today for the third consecutive day as shares on Wall 
Street fluctuated and oil prices remained close to record highs.
The ISEQ closed 100.22 points lower at 7198.19.
Following heavy falls on world markets last week, Goodbody analyst Dermot O'Leary predicted that such 'turbulent 
trading' is set to continue this week.
 With violence in Israel and Lebanon continuing into a sixth day, oil prices edged slightly lower as world leaders 
weighed their options, including a possible United Nations peacekeeping force. However, with no resolution in sight, 
world markets remained wary. 'Unfortunately, right now this conflict in the Middle East is the elephant in the room, 
and nothing's going to happen until there's a little more clarity there,' said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at 
Harris Private Bank. 'This is probably a market best viewed from the sidelines.' The market is also holding its breath 
as it awaits Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's semi-annual testimony to Congress on Wednesday. 
Investors will be looking for any hints regarding interest rates. Davy economist, Rossa White, said: 'Expectations for 
a Fed hike in August have oscillated dramatically in recent weeks. At one stage, a 25bps rise looked a done deal. 
That is no longer the case and the market reckons the probability of a move is 40pc now. We will know a lot more 
by Thursday morning." Back in Dublin, investors were given some positive news yesterday as NCB Stockbrokers 
issued an upbeat forecast for Irish equities in the second half of 2006. It said that the effect of better economic 
conditions in Japan and the eurozone should offset higher interest rates. It added that dividend growth and the 
possibility of further merger and acquisition activity make growth prospects for the second half attractive in the Irish 
market. NCB said that its favoured stocks for the second half of the year are AIB, CRH, Ryanair, Elan, Grafton, 
Kingspan, IAWS, C and C, DCC, McInerney and IFG. On the market today, the financials were the biggest fallers, 
with Irish Life and permanent the biggest loser, falling 30c to 1705. Anglo Irish Bank fared little better, down 29c to 
1101, while AIB slipped 25c to 1738. Bank of Ireland was also down, 10c to 1325, after reports over the weekend 
ISEQ shares close 100 points lower
indicated that funds under management at BOI's asset management division have slid back E3bn from the fiscal 
year end March level of E45bn. All eyes now turn to the groups AGM on Friday from which any trading commentary 
will be closely scrutinised by investors. CRH led the construction sector lower, falling 50c to 2480, while Grafton 
also fell considerably, down 30c to 980. Elsewhere, McInerney slipped 10c to 1090 and Kingspan was unchanged 
on 1090. Shares in no-frills airline Ryanair were down 15c to 713 after the EU proposed forcing all airlines to 
disclose full taxes and charges when advertising on their websites or in the media. DCC was one of few gainers, 
climbing 15c to 1915, while Greencore managed to close 3c higher on 415.

NCB Stockbrokers today issued a positive forecast for Irish equities in the second half of 2006.
The group said that in common with most other equity markets, Ireland saw a sharp sell off in the second quarter 
despite generally stable to improving global economic prospects.
"In our view the prospect of higher interest rates does not of itself undermine the case for equities, reflecting as it 
does improved economic prospects. Economic growth in Ireland has averaged 7.3pc (GDP) over the past decade 
and is projected to reach 6.0pc in 2006 and 6.3pc in 2007."
 "The primary driver of this growth has been demographics (both internal and a switch from emigration to 
immigration). We expect demographic influences to remain positive over the medium term and see further gains in 
productivity." NCB also said that its favoured stocks for the second half of 2006 are AIB, CRH, Ryanair, Elan,

Shares on the Dublin market slipped back this morning following overnight losses on Wall Street as oil prices hit 
new records.
At midday, the ISEQ was down 71.48 at 7519.76.
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in August, hit a record USD75.89 per barrel in electronic 
deals before the official daily opening of the US market. That beat the previous peak of USD75.78 set last Friday 
amid simmering geopolitical tensions over Iran and North Korea.
 Brent North Sea crude for August delivery struck a record USD75.45 per barrel in electronic dealing, beating its 
previous high of USD75.09 which was also set on July 7. Construction stocks were the worst hit as investors 
plundered yesterday's gains in the sector. McInerney was the worst hit, down 44c to 1100, while CRH slipped 20c 
to 2630 and Grafton fell 23c to 1045. Kingspan fared little better, down 10c to 1340. Housebuilder Abbey was also 
down, 58c to 895, after it reported lower pre-tax profits of E47.1 million in the year to the end of April compared to 
E57.47 million the previous year. Abbey said the decline in pre-tax profits was due to increased margin pressure 
despite improving market conditions in the UK. The financial sector was also down considerably, with AIB down 21c 
to 1850, Bank of Ireland was 23c lower at 1374, while Anglo Irish Bank fell 12cto 1175. Irish Life and Permanent 
bucked the trend climbing 10c to 1800. Ryanair was another faller, down 17c to 753, while Paddy Power slipped 
15c to 1330. Newcourt was unchanged despite confirming this morning that it has made an offer for Ely Property. In 
a note to the Irish Stock Exchange, the firm said that, further to recent speculation of a bid, the company is in 
discussions with Ely "which may or may not lead to an offer". Shares in the company remained at 130. Greencore 
was down 6c to 414 after it was announced on Wednesday that it was to receive 70pc of the EU's sugar 
restructuring compensation fund. Farmers, who are to get the remainder of the money, have called the decision 
"outrageous" and vowed to examine their options with a view to fighting the decision. Elan was one of the few major 
stocks to make any headway in the morning session, climbing 15c to 1205.

Construction stocks led the Dublin market higher this morning as investors benefited from a strong finish to trading

At midday, the ISEQ was up 48.24 to 7614.93.
CRH led the way in the construction sector, climbing 20c to 2685. Kingspan was not far behind, up 19c to 1345, 
while Grafton was 3c higher at 1067 and McInerney was up 6c to 1145.
 The financials enjoyed a mixed morning. Anglo Irish Bank was down 5c to 1180 as investors pocketed yesterday's 
gains. AIB was up 17c to 1887, while shares in Irish Life and Permanent were 21c higher at 1811. Bank of Ireland 
was down 3c to 1392. Independent News and Media traded higher for the second consecutive day as it awaits 
changes to the laws in Australia governing media ownership. The proposals, due to be revealed fully later this 
week, are expected to lift a ban on companies owning newspaper, radio and television operations in the same city 
or region. The changes could benefit Independent, which owns 40pc of APN, as they would allow IN and M to up its 
stake in the Australian firm. IN and M was up 8c to 235. Elsewhere, Ryanair was also in the black, up 19c to 772, 
while Elan was up 5c to 1180. DCC was 15c higher on 1950, while C and C was up 20c to 775.

Construction stocks led the Dublin market modestly higher today, however gains were capped by a slow start on 
Wall Street.
The ISEQ closed 38.09 points higher on 7604.78.
Kingspan led the way in the construction sector, climbing 28c to 1353, while Grafton was 4c higher at 1068 and 
McInerney was up 5c to 1144. CRH closed unchanged on 2665, having been up as much as 25c earlier in the day.
 The financials endured a mixed day. Anglo Irish Bank was down 3c to 1182 as investors pocketed gains from 
earlier in the week. AIB was up 5c to 1882, while shares in Irish Life and Permanent were 20c higher at 1810. Bank 
of Ireland was unchanged at 1395. Independent News and Media traded higher for the second consecutive day as 
reports suggested that it could benefit from possible changes to the laws in Australia governing media ownership. 
The changes, set to be revealed fully later this week, would remove a 15pc limit on overseas ownership of 
Australian broadcasters and a 25pc limit on foreign control of mass circulation newspapers. It has been suggested 
that the change in the regulation of the market could clear the way for a wave of large-mergers. The move could 
open up opportunities for Independent which owns 40pc Australian newspaper group APN. The group closed 11c 
higher at 2.38. Meanwhile, Ryanair was also in the black, up 19c to 772, despite the High Court dismissing an 
application from the no- frills airline seeking disclosure of the identities of pilots using a website set up by the 
Ryanair European Pilot's Association. Ryanair argued that some of their pilots had been intimidated by postings by 
anonymous individuals using code names such as 'I hate Ryanair'. The court ruled that there was no evidence of 
bullying by defendants to the action and that the only evidence of bullying was by Ryanair. Shares in Irish Estates 
shot were up 15c to 315 after the property firm confirmed the acquisition of Beverly Smyth, Nat Ross, Oman 
Transport, McConnells and Hire-A-Crate in a deal worth up to E14m. The purchase is part of Irish Estate's strategy

licences in the Tete Province of western Mozambique. Greencore shares were down 5c to 420 as investors waited 
to see how much the company would receive of the E145m EU compensation package after sugar reforms in 
Brussels led to the closure of Greencore factories in Carlow and Mallow, and the end of the Irish beet industry. 
Shares are likely to soar in the coming days after it was confirmed that Greencore will receive the lions share of the 
money. Elsewhere, DCC was down 1c to, while C and C was up 25c to 770 and Elan was up 25c to 1200.

Report: Low-cost airline Ryanair to cut back in Sweden
Report: Low-cost airline Ryanair to cut back in Sweden

STOCKHOLM, Sweden Irish low-cost airline Ryanair said Tuesday it will cut back its operations in Sweden because 
of the government's plans to introduce a special airport tax.
Ryanair will shut down all traffic from Vasteras in central Sweden to London and cut the number of departures from 
the southern cities of Malmo and Goteborg, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley told Swedish news 
agency TT. The cuts will reduce annual passenger traffic by about 350,000 people in Sweden, Cawley said.
The decision follows plans by the Swedish government to introduce an airport tax of 94 kronor (â¬10; US$13) per 
ticket sold. The tax has been passed by parliament, but has been severely criticized by airline operators and is 
under review in the EU, which has questioned whether it violates the union's competition rules.
"This cannot come as a surprise. We have made it clear what would happen ever since the government voted for 
the new tax in June," Lotta Lindquist-Brosjo, head of the airline's Nordic operations, told SR.
Cawley told TT that the company could not wait for the EU to decide whether to allow the tax.
"We must complete the planning of our winter timetables," he was quoted as saying.
As of Oct. 28, all traffic between Vasteras and London will end, and the number of daily departures from Malmo to 
London will be cut from two to one. Planes will depart from Goteborg to Glasgow three times per day, instead of 
five, Cawley said.
The airline had previously planned to expand in Sweden, which Lindquist-Brosjo said it might still do if the 
government decides to scrap the tax.

The Dublin market followed world markets lower today with Wall Street supplying little impetus due to a lack of 
major economic data.
The ISEQ closed 83.21points lower on 7566.69.
CRH was one of the day's biggest fallers, closing 64c lower at 2666. Elsewhere in the construction sector, Grafton 
was up 15c to 1065, McInerney was 24c higher on 1139, while Kingspan was down just 1c to 1326.
 The financials turned in a similarly mixed performance. While AIB was down 24c to 1870, Anglo Irish Bank closed 
21c higher at 1186. Bank of Ireland was up 1c to 1396, while Irish Life and Permanent was 28c lower on 1791. Elan 
continued its volatile trading of recent months, falling 75c to close at 1175 despite US firm Abbott Laboratories 
asking the Irish biotechnology firm for permission to use its specialised NanoCrystal technology to merge Abbott 
cholesterol drug Tricor with AstraZeneca cholesterol drug Crestor. Cholesterol drugs are the largest-selling 
category of drugs in the world and are currently valued at USD32bn. FBD Holdings continued its positive trading of 
recent weeks, climbing almost 3pc, or 110c, to 3810. DCC was also in the black after media reports today 
suggested that there was a shareholder revolt at its AGM on Monday. The revolt centred around the re-election of 
several key-directors. At the meeting, DCC reported a turnaround in the fortunes of its games distribution business, 
SerCom, which had been dogged by falling prices. It also said that it was pleased with trading results in the first 
quarter and, in particular, the continuing pick-up in the results of DCC SerCom. Furthermore, DCC chief executive 
Jim Flavin reported that the company is still active on the acquisition front, and hopes to add to its oil distribution 
business. Independent News and Media was down 6c to 231 after press reports suggested that the Australian 
government could be about to announce changes in foreign ownership of media. Such a move could affect the 
Independent's Australia and New Zealand business, APN News and Media. Under the current rules, foreign 
ownership of newspaper titles is restricted to 20pc for a metropolitan title and 49.9pc for regional titles. Recent 
rumours have suggested that Independent is keen to increase its stake in APN, which publishes a number of 
ISEQ follows world markets lower
regional titles along the east coast of Queensland. Independent owns 40pc of the Australian firm. Ryanair was 
another faller, slipping 25c to 755. The no-frills airline announced today that it is closing its operation at Stockholm's 
Vasteros airport, and will significantly reduce services from Malmoe and Gothenburg ahead of the introduction of a 
new Swedish flight tax on Aug 1. The possibility of the tax has unnerved airlines for some time now, prompting 
several to reconsider their operations in Sweden. Meanwhile, the European Commission said on Monday that it is 
studying the need for new rules to govern airline ticket pricing. That followed a German TV programme which 
accused Ryanair of mis-stating taxes and airport passenger fees - an accusation which the Irish airline has refuted. 
Elsewhere on the market, Greencore was up 8c to 425, while C and C was 1c higher on 756.

Body
The recent market correction is no more than evidence that investor enthusiasm during the bull run was too 
extreme, argues Gavin Corr, manager of Merrill Lynch's European fund.
So, where does one find good value amid the downturn in European equities? There is plenty to be unearthed 
according to Mr Corr, who believes the economic backdrop for stocks is benign, despite the fact that interest rates 
are rising. Look to sectors that have underperformed in the past two or three years such as food retailers and 
banks. He cites Tesco, HSBC and Lloyds as particularly attractive.
"These stocks had been performing very poorly," he says. Mr Corr's principal strategy to fend off swings in the 
market is to rotate the portfolio's holdings frequently. He never hesitates to sell stocks he considers overvalued and 
buy undervalued ones. "We're quite unemotional about it. We're willing to step off the train when momentum is 
really strong," he says.
The fund's exposure to commodities and investment banks has been pared recently and HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Tesco 
as well as Danone have been purchased. Mining issues such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are also on his radar as 
they are "far cheaper now than he thought they were". "We see good value in metal and mining stocks and also 
insurance stocks, steel companies, construction groups and some of the chemical companies and the magnitude of 
the share price moves we're witnessing obliges us to take action," he says.
The fund's results have been boosted recently by its underweight position in telecoms and and overweight stance 
on banking. But its limited exposure to auto stocks, which performed well at the start of the year, was a mistake. 
Vallourec, the French steel maker, Novartis, the pharmaceutical giant, and CRH, the Irish construction group, are 
three favourites. Earlier this year, the fund lost money on Ryanair, the budget airline.
The fund, which launched in 1993, has about Euros 718m in assets. BP, HSBC and GlaxoSmithKline are some of 
the biggest holdings in the portfolio that concentrates on about 31 stocks. More than a third of the fund is in UK 
issues and about a quarter in financials. Its benchmark is MSCI's Europe index.
Merrill finds silver linings
In the past six months, the fund outperformed its benchmark by a small margin, reporting a 6.89 per cent rise 
against a 4.7 per cent return by the European equity index, according to Standard & Poor's.
In the past year, the fund reported a 24.34 per cent return against a 19.3 per cent return by the index.
Mr Corr puts a lot of emphasis on diversifying the portfolio to a wide number of sectors to ensure the portfolio is not 
vulnerable to downward swings in the market.
"We like to maintain a low-risk profile," he says. He still thinks European equities look cheap and predicts many 
companies will see double-digit earnings this year. Dividend yields are growing and cash generation is high. Also, a 
wave of mergers and acquisitions should improve share prices.

Low-cost carrier Ryanair said it is closing its operation at Stockholm's Vasteros airport, and will significantly reduce 
services from Malmoe and Gothenburg ahead of the introduction of a new Swedish flight tax on Aug 1.
The airline will continue flying to Stockholm Skavsta'a airport, but in total, 21 flights from Sweden to various 
European destinations are to be axed.
The flight tax, the product of an agreement between the Social Democratic government and its Green and Left 
Party allies, will tax each passenger 94 skr for flights within Europe, and 188 skr for those travelling further afield.
 However, certain airports in remote parts of Sweden are exempt from the tax, prompting the European 
Commission in Brussels to launch an inquiry to see whether it breaks competition rules.

Body
C and C led the Dublin market higher today after a leading stockbroker upgraded its growth forecast for the firm, 
however gains were capped as investors ponder what the ECB will do with interest rates at its next meeting in 
August.
The ISEQ closed 39.24 points higher on 7637.21.
Investors continue to be spooked after the European Central Bank strongly hinted last week that it will raise interest 
rates when it next meets on 3 August.
 Having had time to fully digest the words of president Trichet and the ECB, Davy Stockbrokers said that it now 
expects the ECB to raise its refi rate to 4pc by Q2 2007. 'The strength of euro area money growth, the momentum 
behind the expansion and ECB rhetoric lead us to this conclusion,' said Davy analyst Rossa White. 'The gap 
between rate hikes is likely to close from three months to two months, beginning on August 3rd. That timetable may 
well continue into the first half of next year. The ECB may yet push beyond neutral, which-based on staffers' 
forecasts-is somewhere around 3.75-4pc. 'Remember that in its one and only hiking cycle to date, the ECB 
increased its refi rate to 4.75pc. But euro area growth reached 4pc+ then, inflated by the over-investment binge of 
1999/2000. Potential GDP growth is probably lower now and we are unlikely to see that kind of over-exuberance 
again. So 4.25-4.5pc is more likely to be the limit this time in circumstances where current momentum is sustained,' 
he added. C and C was one of the day's biggest gainers, climbing 20c to 758. The drinks company said last week 
that both revenues and operating profits, for the first four months of its financial year, are 'significantly' ahead of 
expectations. This led Davy Stockbrokers to upgrade its EPS forecast for C and C for this year by 19pc - to 39.6 
cent from 33.3 cent. Davy analyst John O'Reilly made the upgrade due to the phenomenal growth momentum of 
Bulmers in the UK (known there as Magners). The financials endured a mixed day. AIB was up 18c to 1895, Irish 
Life and Permanent was up 7c to1819 and Bank of Ireland was 18c higher on 1384. Shares in Anglo Irish were

McInerney fell13c at 1115 and Kingspan was 8c lower on 1327. Ryanair tacked on 12c to780 despite reports that is 
facing an EU probe into alleged misstating of taxes and airport passenger fees. A UK newspaper this morning said 
that Ryanair has been accused of systematically inflating charges added to ticket prices for flights from airports 
including Dublin, Treviso, Charleroi, Rome, Pisa and Alghero. Ryanair dismissed the report and said it was based 
on 'an inaccurate and untrue claim' Greencore closed 7c higher at 417.

Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, is facing an EU probe into alleged misstating of taxes and airport passenger fees, 
according to media reports.
The carrier is accused of inflating charges added to ticket prices for flights from some of its airports, a practice that 
may breach EU law. Ryanair allegedly levies 'taxes' which are in fact charges made by the company.
Some so-called taxes are alleged to have been levied at airports where there is no government tax.
 At Brussels/Charleroi, for example, Ryanair charges a 'tax' of E7 where there is no government tax. Eva 
Lichtenberger of the European Parliament's transport committee plans to call for an EC inquiry after the claims were 
made in the German media. 'This is a very serious matter,' she said. Ryanair denied any misrepresentation of its 
charges and insisted that all its fees accurately reflect costs imposed at Europe's airports.

 (ANSA) - Oristano, July 10 - Irish low-cost carrier RyanAir is among the companies showing an interest in 
operating flights from the Sard Fenosu airport of Oristano, on the Italian southern island of Sardinia, Sogeaor, the 
company which runs Sard Fenosu, said on July 8, 2006 at a presentation of the projects, which have been realised, 
are underway, or are about to be put into action under the port's four-phase development plan.
 RyanAir has set as a required minimum for operating flights from Sard Fenosu the availability of a 1,800-metre-
long runway, Sogeaor said, adding the current length of the airport's runway was 1,199 metres and the width was 
30 metres.
 The extension of the runway to 1,800 metres is included in a project, presented by Sogeaor in line with a plan, 
which was jointly elaborated with the Oristano Province, envisaging the allocation of almost 20 mln euro ($ 25.62 
mln), the airport operator stated.

EasyJet, the low-cost carrier, has raised its profit guidance sharply to reflect strong demand for short- haul flights in 
Europe and higher fares during the peak summer season.
Andy Harrison, chief executive, said that pre-tax profit in the financial year to the end of September was expected to 
rise by 40 to 50 per cent to between Pounds 115m and Pounds 124m, up from Pounds 82.6m last year.
As recently as the beginning of May, EasyJet indicated an increase in profit of 10 to 15 per cent.
Shares in EasyJet rose by 34p yesterday to close at 425p, its highest level for four years.
In recent weeks, EasyJet has made up all the ground it lost in April when its share price fell sharply from 358p to 
309 1/2p over three weeks in response to the sale by FL Group, the Icelandic investor, of its 16.9 per cent stake.
EasyJet's guidance strengthened investor confidence in the UK and Irish airlines sector with Ryanair and British 
Airways also closing higher. Both airlines reported strong traffic data this week with premium traffic at BA in June 
11.7 higher than a year ago.
Shares in BA closed 10 3/4p higher yesterday at 359p and those in Ryanair rose 19 cents to Euros 7.715.
EasyJet said its improving performance reflected "underlying revenue strength."
In June, it filled 87.6 per cent of its available seats compared with 85.1 per cent in the same month a year ago. 
Fears the World Cup could depress demand on non-German routes have proved unfounded.
Mr Harrison said "despite hesitations about the effect of the World Cup on non-Germany travel, we have seen good 
performances throughout our network."
For the latest quarter from April to June, EasyJet said unit revenues, the total revenue per seat flown, had risen by 
17 per cent, helped by the late Easter this year.

Mr Harrison said that full-year total revenues per seat were expected to be 3 to 4 per cent higher, helped by a 30 
per cent jump in ancillary revenues, including higher commission for hotel bookings, car rental and travel insurance.
The low-cost carriers led by EasyJet have been able to raise their average fares in response to rises at most of the 
network airlines.

European equity markets struggled against the headwinds of interest rate uncertainty and US employment data this 
week.
And while none of the FTSE Eurofirst 300's constituents took off particularly strongly, improving passenger numbers 
at several airlines - notably the UK's EasyJet - gave some of Europe's main carriers a lift. At the other end of the 
pan-European index stood a number of aerospace companies, namely those associated with troubled aircraft 
builder Airbus.
Over the week, the Eurofirst 300 index gained 0.2 per cent to finish at 1,316.45, after easing 0.2 per cent yesterday.
Ryanair, the Irish budget airline, gained 8.6 per cent over the week to Euros 7.71 after it reported a 23 per cent 
year-on-year increase in the number of passengers it carried in June.
Air France-KLM yesterday announced a less impressive but still welcome 7.1 per cent increase in June traffic. 
Shares in Air France-KLM rose 0.7 per cent over the week to Euros 18.51.
The gains came after EasyJet reported a 15.6 per cent rise in June passenger numbers and said it expected strong 
full-year profit growth.
EADS, the Europeanaerospace and defence group, fell as doubts were raised about the value of Airbus, the aircraft 
manufacturer in which it has an80 per cent stake. Rothschild, the private bank, valued the 20 per cent of EADS 
owned by BAE Systems of the UK at Euros 2.75bn, a disappointingly low figure.
EADS' shares rebounded 3.2 per cent yesterday after Louis Gallois, the new co-chief executive, said his 
management team's firstpriority was to restore conÃâÃÂ­fidence in the group. Over the week, however, the stock fell 
3.5 per cent to Euros 21.70.
Finmeccanica, which makes parts for Airbus, fell 3.2 per cent to Euros 16.808. In London, BAE dropped 7.4 per 
cent to 342.55p.
 Passenger numbers lift airline operators EUROPE
Energy stocks were buoyed up as oil prices hit fresh all-time highs amid renewedconcerns that supply would not 
meet fast-growing US demand.
Norway's Statoil rose 6 per cent over the week to NKr187.
Shares in Finland's Neste Oil jumped more than 3 per cent on Thursday but ended the week with a rise of just 0.8 
per cent at Euros 27.75. Merrill Lynch raised its price target for Neste to factor in potential gains from the company's 
bio-diesel operations.
"Using companies in the bio-fuels space as our valuation benchmark, Neste's bio-diesel business is worth Euros 3 
a share," the broker said, lifting its target price from Euros 33 to Euros 36.
Banks had a mixed week, clouded by interest rate decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of 
England, while US non-farm payrolls data also led to market nerves.
But Natexis Banques Populaire gained 6 per cent over the week to Euros 189.70 afterbroker Exane BNP Paribas 
favoured the stock because of the expected benefitsof its pending tie-up with rival mutual lender Caisse d'Epargne.

Iberian pilots strike over low-cost subsidiary
 Iberian pilots strike over low-cost subsidiary

As inevitably as the onset of summer, Iberia pilots have called a week-long strike from Monday to protest against 
the Spanish flag-carrier's plans to set up a low-cost airline.
Talks between Iberia and Sepla, the pilots' union, broke down this week, leaving Iberia to threaten a court injunction 
to stop the strike, which could cost the airline Euros 3m-Euros 5m (Dollars 3.8m-Dollars 6.4m) a day. "Spanish law 
does not allow workers to go on strike over a company's strategic business decisions," Iberia said.
The company is already struggling with higher fuel costs. Operational losses in the first quarter of this year doubled 
to Euros 65m.
The strike will force the cancellation of as many as 200 daily flights and affect 200,000 passengers at the start of 
the holiday season, Iberia says. The Spanish government has decreed minimum mandatory services should include 
most long-haul flights, about half of Iberia's domestic and European routes and all flights to the Balearic and Canary 
Islands.
Sepla said the strike was about protecting the jobs of Iberia's 1,900 pilots. "Management wants to dismantle Iberia 
bit by bit, and will use its low-cost offshoot to do so," Sepla said. "Iberia does not want to employ its pilots in its new 
low-cost subsidiary."
In October, Iberia will launch a low-cost airline, provisionally known as Catair, to compete with the likes of Easyjet, 
Ryanair and Air Berlin.
Low-cost carriers have been rapidly gaining market share at the expense of traditional airlines, transporting 1.2m 
passengers in the first quarter of 2006, a 6 per cent rise over the comparable period in 2005, according to the 
Spanish Institute of Tourism Studies.
Iberia wants to give up some of its loss-making European and domestic flights to concentrate on its profitable routes 
to the Americas. It will initially have a 20 per cent stake in Catair, although it is providing half of the Euros 50m in 
Iberian pilots strike over low-cost subsidiary
start-up capital. Catair has been structured as a stand-alone company, "so as not to contaminate the new airline 
with Iberia's higher cost structure", said Iberia.
That includes the costs of pilots, which represent the biggest single outlay for the company, according to Iberia. 
Iberia's pilots earn on average Euros 150,000 a year for flying 80 hours a month - in line with other European pilots.
Although Fernando Conthe, Iberia's chairman, has written to every pilot assuring them their jobs are not at risk, 
Sepla said it had seen the writing on the wall. It suspected Iberia would recruit low-cost pilots from eastern Europe 
to man Catair's flights.
"Iberia's management plan, announced last October, estimates it will retire 27 planes before 2008, which could put 
300 pilots out of work," Sepla said.
"Catair is expected to build up strength to about 30 aircraft by 2008, and will need to hire more than 300 pilots. The 
similarity in numbers is not a coincidence. It is a deliberate attempt to transfer routes and jobs to the low-cost 
airline," Sepla added.
Iberia said the pilots' fears were unfounded.
Short-haul aircraft would be replaced with long-haul planes as the company expanded services to Asia and the 
Americas. "We will need more pilots, not fewer, if our expansion plan is successful," Iberia said.

(Update) Share prices continued to drift aimlessly as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of today's US June 
employment report. By 9.30am the FTSE 100 index was 23 points lower at 5,867, the Mid-250 index was off 23 
points at 9,438 and the techMARK five points easier at 1,332. Aviva remained on offer at 731p, down 22p, as it 
admitted to holding acquisition talks with AmerUS, the American life assurer, where any deal is likely to be financed 
by cash, debt and a share placing. Prudential, which earlier this year fought off an approach from Aviva, declined 
12p to 589p. Imperial continued to stand out at Â£17.06, up 13p, encouraged by the Florida Supreme Court ruling to 
throw out the $145 billion Engle case class action against the big tobacco companies. Buoyant passenger numbers 
and an upbeat full-year profits forecast from easyJet boosted the shares, 26.5p higher at 417.5p, and lent support 
to British Airways at 351p, up 3p and Ryanair, a fraction better at 7.80. Energy shares attracted support under the 
lead of Drax, 8p firmer at 854p and revived takeover hopes sustained Corus Group at 436p, up 4p. BSkyB 
hardened 2p to 558p in response to a buy note from Deutsche Bank, but elsewhere among the leaders modest falls 
predominated with Alliance & Leicester another 17p weaker at Â£10.38 on disappointment that Credit Agricole has 
decided not to bid. 
Among the smaller caps iSoft shed 8.75p to 54.5p as it postponed its planned results announcement scheduled for 
next Tuesday due to overrunning negotiations with bankers in connection with new accounting policies. Sirdar lost 
5p to 35.5p after lowering its full-year 2007 earnings expectations and negative comment in the Investors Chronicle 
clipped 4p from Proteome Sciences at 38p. Yesterday US profits alert from Taylor Nelson Sofres prompted broker 
downgrades, contributing to a further share price fall of 9.25p to 185.75p. Gaming shares were nervous on a report 
that the Leach and Goodlatte bills have been combined and will be debated on the floor of the House of 
Representatives next week. PartyGaming, still unsettled by recent share sales by directors, dipped 3.25p to 111.5p 
and Sportingbet 12p to 368p. Favourable press comment support K3 Business Technology at 103.5p, up 4p, Hardy 
Oil & Gas, 17p firmer at 290p and Trafficmaster, 1.5p better at 37.25p. Retail Decisions rose 7p to 179p following a 
report that America's Wright Express has entered the bidding. Cheerful trading updates benefited Aga Foodservice 
at 376p, Redrow 499p, Marshalls 307p and Countrywide 511p, all a penny or two firmer. DCC Group hardened a 
penny to 19.1p on acquiring Carlton Fuels and NCC Group perked up 3p to 268p on the deal to buy US-based 
Source Harbour. But a rights issue to finance a bid for Colbond Investments overshadowed Low & Bonar at 128.5p,

UK markets were stuck in the doldrums as dealers waited for the all important non-farm payroll figures this 
afternoon and observed two minutes silence at noon, marking the first anniversary of terrorist bomb attacks on the 
London transport system. Analysts were predicting that between 175,00 and 190,000 new jobs were created in 
America last month. In very subdued trading leading shares had largely erased early modest falls and by 12.45 pm 
the FTSE 100 index was little changed at 5,891 and the Mid-250 index was five points softer at 9,457. In Europe the 
German DAX was 27 points adrift and the CAC-40 five points easier. Aviva remained depressed by the threat of a 
large placing to fund the possible acquisition of US life assurer AmerUS, valued at Â£1.25 billion. 
Airline stocks were buoyed by bumper passenger figures and an upbeat profits forecast from easyJet, 36p higher at 
427p. British Airway rose 10p to 359p and Ryanair 20 cents to 7.34. Mining stocks pushed ahead in the wake of the 
strong copper price. Anglo American at Â£22.75, BHP Billiton Â£10.71, Kazakhmys Â£12.35 and Rio Tinto advanced 
between 22p and 65p, while Falconbridge acquisition hopes lent additional support to Xstrata, 40p better at Â£20.03. 
Tobaccos were mixed following the welcome reaction to Florida's Supreme Court refusal to reinstate the $145 
billion punitive damages award against the companies. Profit-taking knocked 14p from BAT at Â£14.02, but Imperial 
gained 14p to Â£17.07 and Gallaher were a penny firmer at 864p. British Energy put on 6p to 700p following a rating 
upgrade from Goldman Sachs, with Drax 26p higher at 871p in sympathy. BP put on 7p to 645p and Cairn Energy 
23p to Â£21.72 as the crude price continued to trade at near record levels. Property shares succumbed to profit-
taking with British Land off 10p at Â£13.17 and Land Securities 19p lower at Â£18.62, but aerospace shares rallied in 
the wake of recent contracts with BAE Systems at 46p and Rolls-Royce 420p up 5p and 7p. Corus Group were

fell 8p and 13p ahead of figures next week and ITV shed a penny to 102.75p as advertisers hit out at the media 
group's pricing strategy. Daily Mail & General Trust softened 6p to 603p amid talk that Merrill Lynch was attempting 
to place 3.5 million shares at 598p. Among companies reporting, C&C perked up several cents to 7.20 as it said 
both revenue and operating profit for the first four months of its current year were significantly ahead of 
expectations and Lion Trust Asset Management, with Â£5.122 million funds under management, improved 8p to

Body
No-frills airline and Ryanair's biggest competitor in Europe, easyJet, said full year revenues and profits would be 
higher than expected after a good performance across its network.
The Luton-based carrier said it expects annual passenger revenue per seat to rise between 3pc and 4pc for the full 
year and growth in ancillary revenue per seat of about 30pc.
It said the improved revenue outlook had led it to increase its profit guidance, with pretax profit growth now 
expected to be in the range of 40pc and 50pc against previous expectations of 10pc to 15pc.
 The number of earned seats flown in June rose 15.6pc to 2,990,169 while the load factor - how full the company's 
aircraft were - increased by two percentage points to 87.6pc. In the 12 months to June 2006, the number of earned 
seats flown rose 13.5pc to 32,122,137, although the load factor fell 0.7 percentage points to 84.4pc. Total revenues 
for the year rose by 21.8pc to Â£1.535bn.

Geopolitical concerns combined with profit-taking accounted for much of the decline in European share prices 
yesterday, as equity markets across the globe were hit by nervousness after North Korea's test firing of seven 
missiles.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 ended at 1,306.07, down1.2 per cent, as early losses accelerated when Wall Street opened 
sharply weaker.
A fall of more than 1.7 per cent for the technology- heavy Nasdaq Composite index in the US pushed the similarly 
technology-laden Xetra Dax in Frankfurt1.8 per cent lower.
Turkish stocks fell 3 per cent after reports that 23 people had been detained by police for suspected stock-market 
manipulation.
In Europe, the banking sector added most weight to the session's losses, led by the UK's Alliance & Leicester, 
which fell 5.7 per cent after Credit Agricole of France abandoned its bid.
In a statement Agricole said that having evaluated the possible returns it could generate, it had decided not to 
proceed with an offer for Alliance & Leicester. Speculation grew that Agricole may have dropped out of the running 
to have more cash to sweeten its bid for Greece's Emporiki Bank.
Shares in Credit Agricole fell 1.6 per cent to Euros 29.82, while Emporiki Bank was0.2 per cent higher at Euros 
27.56.
Marfin, the Greek financial services group, said on Tuesday it would not bid for Emporiki as it was not in a position 
to tender a competitive offer. Its shares rose1 per cent to Euros 25.26. Bank of Cyprus, which is also in the running 
for Emporiki, fell 1.1 per cent to Euros 7.22.
National Bank of Greece fell 3.9 per cent to Euros 28.44. The bank said its Euros 3bn rights issue to finance the 
acquisition of Finansbank of Turkey had been subscribed 1.6 times and there wouldbe no need for a private 
placement of shares. The subscription period forthe rights issue endedyesterday.
Banks add most weight to losses EUROPE
Unicredit, Italy's top bank, said it was targeting compound earnings per share growth of 27 per cent a year to 2008 
after its acquisition last year of Germany's HVB. Staff cuts and a recovery in demand in its main Italian, German 
and Austrian markets would help support growth, the bank said.
But concerns over slower dividend growth and further acquisitions led the shares down 3.1 per cent to Euros 5.959.
Investors were unimpressed by German tyremaker Continental's announcement that its full-year goal remained to 
beat 2005 sales and profit.
Continental shares fell3.6 per cent to Euros 78.40, while French rival Michelin fell1.2 per cent to Euros 46.25.
Ryanair topped the Eurofirst 300 leaderboard, rising 1.8 per cent to Euros 7.30 after the Irish low-cost airline said it 
had carried 23 per cent more passengers in June than a year ago.

CRH led the Dublin market marginally higher this morning after the building materials group forecast that first half 
profits will be up a third to around E500m compared to the same period last year.
At midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 7.46 to 7566.82.
Gains were limited in the morning session as investors are waiting on the ECB to make its policy decision 
tomorrow. President Trichet is widely expected to keep rates at 2.75pc, postponing any change in rates until later in 
the year.
 However, the accompanying statement will be all-important, and this is where the market's attention will be focused 
as investors look for an indication of what the ECB will do in August. Back in Dublin, shares in CRH were flying high 
after the firm said that its US business has led the growth and, despite subdued trading in a number of major

Ireland West Airport Knock today welcomed its four millionth passenger since the airport opened in 1986.
Mrs Mary Croghan from Castlerea, Co. Roscommon was the airport's four millionth customer and was the lucky 
winner of a shopping spree in the airport's retail shop.
The latest figures show that the month of June was the busiest month ever at Ireland West Airport Knock with over 
65,000 passengers travelling through the airport on its scheduled and sun holiday charter flights. 
 Ireland West Airport Knock said that this brings the total amount of passengers using the airport in the first half of 
this year to just under 300,000, almost a 20pc increase on last year. The airport says that the increased passenger 
numbers is attributable to the growth in the airport's European charter flights as well as its scheduled flights to the 
UK. The airport is currently operating four times daily jet routes to three London airports with easyJet and Ryanair. 
Also, bmibaby's strong performance on its Birmingham and Manchester routes have resulted in that airline 
extending its daily flights to these destinations to twice daily at the beginning of July, they said.

The EU is to tax airline fuel and remove a series of tax breaks given to airlines, in an effort to curb greenhouse gas 
emissions.
MEPs voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of a package of environmental measures that would also bring 
airlines into the EU emissions trading scheme, the Irish Times has reported.
The measures are opposed by budget airlines such as Ryanair, which has already threatened to stop flying to 
Sweden if it introduces its own planned green airline tax.
 Aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of CO2 emissions, with the number of flights in the EU set to double 
by 2020. However, aviation fuel is not subject to VAT and the sector is not bound by strict targets to cut emissions 
set in the Kyoto protocol.

Airlines operating at London Stansted airport have attacked BAA proposals for a second runway and terminal and 
claim the plans are based on unrealistic passenger forecasts. The carriers led by Ryanair and EasyJet said 
research by independent consultants, commissioned by the airlines, "proves that BAA's passenger forecasts are 
without foundation and wildly inflated".
The government has supported the plan for a second runway as the first move to raise airport capacity in the 
overcrowded south-east. The consortium led by Spain's Ferrovial, which has taken over BAA in what is believed to 
be Europe's largest leveraged buy-out, has indicated, however, it is considering reducing planned investment at

Shares on the Dublin market turned in a sluggish performance today in a day of light trading due to the July 4 
holiday in the US.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 7.43 at 7545.15.
There was little direction in world markets with all the US financial markets closed for the Independence Day 
holiday.
 Investors in Dublin are also waiting on the ECB to make its policy decision on Thursday. President Trichet is widely 
expected to keep rates at 2.75pc, postponing any change in rates until later in the year. However, the 
accompanying statement will be all-important, and this is where the market's attention will be focused as investors 
look for an indication of what the ECB will do in August. Volume remained timid throughout the day, although 
certain leading shares were able to add colour to what was an otherwise dull day on the ISEQ. Insurance group 
FBD Holdings was the main gainer of the day, climbing 50c to 3700. FBD confirmed last week that it had bought 
back and cancelled 3.8 million shares from its major shareholder Farmer Business Developments. Shares in the 
construction sector were mainly higher, led by CRH which edged up 15c to 2630. CRH is due to issue a trading 
statement tomorrow, and it is likely to confirm a strong US performance with acquisition activity well-ahead of last 
year. Stockbrokers at Davy have forecast that group revenues will increase by around 20pc in the first half of the 
year, 6pc of which is organic and the remainder from 2005 acquisitions. Davy analyst Barry Dixon also predicted 
that group operating profit will have increased by 18pc, including 7.5pc from organic growth. Davy also reiterated its 
3200c price target for CRH. On Monday, the building materials group was also confirmed as the buyer of 
Netherlands-based blinds maker BV Aluminium Verkoop Zuid. It is believed CRH paid in the region of E76 million 
for the Dutch unit. Elsewhere in the sector, Kingspan also closed in the black, up 5c to 1365, while Grafton was up 
2c to 1002. McInerney slipped 12c to 1102. Kerry Group was up 15c to 16.45. The food group's share price is still

Body
The first few years of the 21st century were tough for the aerospace industry. The events of 9/11, plus other crises 
such as the SARS virus in China, depressed the market and cause wholesale cutbacks. But the industry has 
bounced back rapidly ? so much so, that it now looks like 9/11 was an excuse for many companies to make 
overdue streamlining to their operations. And 9/11 has resulted in an increased focus on defence and security, 
creating opportunities in the high-tech areas of the aerospace industry.
Meanwhile, the airline business has resumed the growth trend that was evident before the terrorist attacks. Driven 
by low-cost carriers, air travel is booming, and this is creating a considerable demand for aircrew and engineering 
staff to support the growing airliner fleets. Can anything prick this bubble of optimism, or are the various players in 
the aircraft industry right to feel upbeat? It seems there is a positive consensus from a lot of the players involved.
The trainer
Pilot training was hit hard by the events of 11 September 2001 ? but now it has bounced back in no uncertain 
terms, believes Graham Austin, chief executive of UK pilot training school Cabair.
?This year has been one of the best opportunities for pilots for some time,? he says. There had been a gradual 
increase in recruitment since 9/11, but now I believe we?re in a new dimension.? The demand for aircrew has 
bounced back because of a ?potent mix of factors?, Austin believes ? and now pilots are in short supply.
?The low-cost airlines are still growing, but more significantly the economies in the Middle East, India and China are 
growing at such a rate. We didn? imagine there?d be such an opportunity,? he says. As a result, Cranfield-based 
Cabair is increasingly finding jobs for pilots at airlines such as Kuwait Airlines and Royal Brunei.
But one thing has changed since 9/11 ? airlines are no longer prepared to pay for pilot training. The message is 
clear for young pilots ? you will have to find the money to fund your own training, but providing you put the work in, 
there are plenty of jobs out there. ?We?re not seeing added interest in airlines spending money on training,? Austin 
says.
Heavy demand.
Austin is finding that the opportunities for pilots are well-paid, too. Low-cost airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair 
may have sliced costs out of many areas of their business, but they have not scrimped on aircrew salaries ? so 
much so that smaller turboprop operators have a hard job hanging on to pilots when the low-cost carriers come 
calling for jet captains and first officers.
The downside for pilots joining the low-cost carriers is they will have to work their maximum 900h a year, thanks to 
sophisticated computerised rostering systems that the airlines use to sweat their assets to the maximum.
While the bar is still set high with regard to training in developed markets, Barber fears there might be a slackening 
of standards in emerging markets as airlines scramble to find enough pilots. ?They could copy the low-cost model, 
but without a firm grip on quality,? he says. Barber sees the aircrew jobs market remaining strong, so long as 
another major disaster does not hit the airline business. ?Another 9/11 is the spectre on the horizon. That could kill 
off growth again,? he says.
The labour provider
With more than 800 engineers working on contract in the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector, 
Resource Group commercial director Bob Keane is well-placed to gauge the health of the engineering sector. ?At 
the moment, business is really booming ? we?re doubling our business year-on-year,? he says. ?It? staggering to 
think of what? happened since 2001.?
However, despite his bullish point of view, Keane can see problems on the horizon. ?The business had been in 
decline for quite a few years leading up to 2001, and 9/11 was an excuse for airlines to look at their organisations to 
see where costs could be cut.? The rise of the low-cost carriers and their leaner business model has also 
accelerated moves to outsource MRO operations, although that can bring new problems.
Specifically, Keane sees a growing skills shortage ? a result of cutbacks in training over the past few years. The 
organised training programmes that used to provide a steady supply of experienced and well trained engineers 
have gone. Now military headcounts are down and the focus on security means engineers are being retained. 
Meanwhile, many graduate and apprentice programmes run by original equipment manufacturers and airlines have 
fallen victim to cost-cutting programmes. ?Training was seen as a luxury item ? the responsibility for providing 
trained people fell to the colleges. It? a demographic time bomb.?
So severe is the situation that Resource Group has started its own apprentice scheme and the first intake of 12 
apprentices will complete their training in July. They should not find trouble getting jobs because as well as the 
burgeoning MRO sector, large manufacturing programmes such as the Airbus A380 are equally demanding on 
resources. ?We see that side of the business growing by 50-60% in the next six months,? Keane says.
Increasingly, Keane is finding European jobs for engineers from other parts of the world. He is looking for ?anyone 
who can legally work in Europe and has the right skills, aptitude and attitude. We have to think globally now ? we 
can? just recruit from the UK. We?ll travel to all parts of the globe to identify the right skills.? For the future, the 
aerospace industry needs to make itself more appealing as a career at schools level ? children as young as 10 
should be made aware of the opportunities the industry provides, he believes.
Keane would like to see more assistance from the UK government in helping specialist organisations such as 
Resource Group set up technical training programmes. ?We want at least a level playing field with academic 
colleges. Academia is not training people for the skills the customer wants.?
The student pilot
Rob Adds is paying to become a pilot and he is confident the investment and risk will be worthwhile. Thirteen 
months in to his course at Cabair? Cranfield training school in central England, he has just started the multi-engine 
element of the course. ?The job opportunities definitely seem to be improving,? he said. ?There definitely seems to 
be an upward trend.? He reckons he is about six weeks away from starting to apply for jobs, but he is confident of 
finding work, as long as he gets a good first-time pass on his instrument rating.
Heavy demand.
?The market is very competitive, and you do hear stories about some pilots being unemployed for years, but if you 
get good grades you tend to get snapped up. I?m hoping to be recommended by Cabair to one of the airlines they 
have strong links with ? British Airways or Flybe. And I?ll be getting my CV off to other airlines too.?
Realistically, Adds is hoping for a first officer? job on turboprops as a first job, which should net him around 
?20,000-25,000 ($37,000-46,000) a year. If all goes according to plan it should take six to seven years to rise 
through the ranks to jet captain. He is also looking at the business jet sector ? another growing area. ?I?m 
reasonably upbeat about getting a job,? he says.
If he can not get a job straight away, there is a Plan B. ?If I?m still unemployed after six months I?ll take a flight 
instructor? course and try and build some hours and practise teaching.? Adds has wanted to fly since he was a 
schoolboy, and joined the Manchester and Salford University Air Squadron to get some basic training when he was 
a student. When some of his squadron colleagues got jobs at airlines, Adds decided to follow them, taking an office 
job to earn the cash to fund his training.
?I?m just happy to be flying. If someone says ?fly my Cessna and I?ll pay for your flight instructor course?, that?ll 
be fine by me,? he says.
The headhunter
Recruitment consultancy CBSbutler specialises in finding technical and engineering personnel for a wide range of 
aerospace companies, ranging from MRO operations to manufacturers and suppliers. But while the market is 
booming, it is going through several shifts in emphasis, believes managing director Dave Leyshon. Finding the right 
candidate for the job is not as easy at it seems. In the MRO area, there has been a significant recovery post-9/11. 
But the market is changing. ?Cost is a big challenge,? says Leyshon. ?A lot of bread-and-butter work has been 
shipped off to low-cost regions in eastern Europe and the Far East ? sending work away from Europe.?
So while there are plenty of job opportunities for MRO engineers, they are not necessarily conveniently located. 
Leyshon believes that is not a problem, as Europe offers plenty of opportunities elsewhere. ?We?re seeing 
significant demand all round. We?re now placing people who previously worked in MRO into the manufacturing 
side, into large projects like the Airbus A380. All the aircraft manufacturers are expanding their ranges and there us 
significant demand for engineers ? the skill sets are common to MRO and manufacturing.?
The manufacturing sector is going to continue to provide plenty of employment opportunities in the future, thanks to 
a number of driving forces ? emissions regulations, cost and weight reductions and the need for all-new aircraft 
ranges, with Airbus and Boeing both needing to replace their main short-range single-aisle jet ranges in the near- 
to-mid-term.
These aircraft will include plenty of new and unfamiliar technologies, generating a need within the aerospace sector 
for different skill sets, such as computer engineers. CBSbutler is placing increasing numbers of people from non-
aerospace backgrounds, such as software engineers from the computer industry. These skills are especially in 
demand in the defence sector, where demand for technologists is ?insatiable?, Leyshon says.
Encouragingly, he says there is evidence of a return to formal graduate recruitment programmes. Airlines are again 
looking to recruit management graduate trainees, he says, and CBSbutler has just completed a programme for 
MBDA, the European missiles joint venture between EADS, BAE Systems and Finmeccanica, that involved 
recruiting more than 100 graduate engineers.
Also for MBDA, CBSbutler is to headhunt 50 experienced managers to help run programmes to strict cost 
structures for demanding customers such as the UK Ministry of Defence. ?They recognise the need to strengthen 
their capability to manage large programmes,? Leyshon says.
The low-cost carrier
Heavy demand.
Repositioning itself as a low-fares airline in 2002 has proved a successful decision for regional carrier Flybe, based 
at Exeter, south-west England. The airline has expanded rapidly, with a fleet of 44 Bombardier Q400 twin 
turboprops on order ? 25 have so far been delivered ? and a dozen or so BAE Systems 146s. These jets are due to 
be replaced from this August by Embraer 195 twinjets.
With this expansion has come the need to recruit aircrew, but there seems to be no shortage of suitable candidates, 
believes Captain Ian Cheese, general manager turboprop. ?We are currently planning to recruit around 130 pilots a 
year to fuel our expansion needs, and there continues to be a large number of low-hour pilots to select from.?
Cheese says Flybe has always had a lot of interest from low-hour pilots in joining the airline. ?An online application 
form attracted 1,300 applicants in eight weeks.? All pilots joining the carrier start on the turboprop fleet, flying 
Q400s. However, Cheese says it is relatively easy to step up to jets. ?The Q400 is performs in many respects like a 
jet of a similar size.?
Flybe has also become one of the first airlines to restart sponsored pilot training. ?We currently run a partial 
sponsorship scheme with Cabair and a mentor airline pilot scheme with Flight Training Europe,? says Cheese. With 
the Cabair scheme, Flybe funds ?20,000 of the ?55,000 course costs. Six students a year are sponsored this way 
and in the first two years all have been taken on by Flybe. The mentored pilots receive about ?7,000, and some 
extra training is paid for by Flybe once they have completed the course.
Such programmes give the airline better control, he believes. ?These schemes ensure that we achieve quality 
control from a very early stage as we are part of the selection process from the outset.? In addition, non-sponsored 
students are also being recruited directly after finishing their courses. ?We draw both Integrated and ?One Stop? 
Modular students from five UK flight training organisations on recommendation,? said Cheese, who is also prepared 
to look further afield and hire non-UK pilots. ?We hire pilots with a JAA licence and the right to live and work in the 
UK.?
One problem for carriers with large turboprop fleets is retaining aircrew. Given the thirst for pilots among large 
carriers and rival jet-based low-fares airlines, it is inevitable that some of Flybe? pilots are lured elsewhere. Cheese 
is philosophical: ?I would not use the term ?poaching?. Pilots aspire to different things and there will always be a 
group that wish to fly different aeroplanes, work closer to home or overseas, or fly in a different environment. That 
has always been the way in aviation.?
To counter pilots leaving, Cheese says Flybe can offer a fast track to a captain? job. ?A commander? salary here 
will exceed a first officer? pay on a 757,? he says. Some pilots have progressed within around three years. ?We 
have some very young captains, including one 24-year-old who wasn? old enough to hire a car.?
The long-haul airline
The current spike in demand for air travel has seen passenger traffic in the first four months of 2006 running 7% up 
on last year, while airliner manufacturers are reporting record deliveries. Among the biggest winners from this 
market boom are the large Middle Eastern carriers, with more than half the widebodied aircraft to be delivered over 
the next 16 years estimated as going to airlines in the region.
Rick Helliwell, vice-president of recruitment for one of the fastest-growing airlines in the region, Emirates, has a job 
on his hands managing the company? need for staff. He is looking to recruit 300 aircrew this year alone, mainly to 
service growth; Emirates is adding 14 widebodied jets to its fleet this year alone.
And as Emirates? policy is only to recruit experienced aircrew, he has to rely on the reputation of the airline, plus 
the appeal of the Dubai lifestyle, to get the best candidates. ?We get a steady flow of applications ? pilots can 
register their interest in working for Emirates online. But a lot of applicants don? have sufficient experience. We look 
for 4,000h, including 2,000h on multi-engine jets.?
Heavy demand.
Applicants who fulfil that requirement have to undergo a thorough interview process, including flight simulators and 
psychometric testing. Only about half of those interviewed make the grade, says Helliwell, but because those hired 
already have plenty of hours, the route from first officer to captain is quick ? three to four years.
Whereas Emirates was able to hang on to its aircrew in the immediate post-9/11 period, Helliwell has noticed an 
increased turnover in aircrew recently as demand has picked up in other regions. ?China needs thousands of pilots 
over the next few years, and there could be a pilot shortage soon in the USA,? he says. ?It? getting more 
challenging to attract the right people.? Emirates casts its net far afield when it hires pilots, including as far away as 
South America and Australasia ? Helliwell himself is a New Zealander.
Emirates? thirst for new recruits is not just confined to aircrew. The airline has opted not to outsource MRO, and is 
building a massive new maintenance hangar in Dubai to service its A380 fleet. ?We?re also hiring engineers and 
mechanics from all over the world,? says Helliwell. ?We need to cope with the growing numbers of aircraft, plus the 
extra areas of specialisation on the aircraft ? for example we need specialists to maintain our in-flight entertainment 
systems alone.?
Emirates Group has become a diverse organisation, managing all ground handling at Dubai airport in addition to its 
large air cargo and IT divisions. ?In total we?re recruiting 4,000-5,000 people across the whole organisation this 
year.? Many of these are cabin crew, with Emirates now hiring between 60 and 80 new cabin staff each week. ?We 
have a need for more than 10,000 new cabin staff in the next five years,? says Helliwell.
Not even ?another 9/11? will dent the growth projections, he believes. ?You can? stop evolution, only dent it. The 
trends for the global economy and global mobility are rising - so the future looks bright.?

The European Cockpit Association (ECA) has set up a system for representing pilots? interests across multiple-
base pan-European airlines. This has already been arranged for EasyJet crews, says the British Air Line Pilots 
Association (BALPA), and the organisation has set its sights on doing the same for Ryanair pilots.
BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan says ?there is no European employment law which is portable [across 
national borders], even though there are [pan-European] corporate laws?. EasyJet has 16 bases in Europe where 
the crew are either hired locally or are expatriates living there, but all of them are on a contract drawn up under UK 
employment law.
BALPA chairman Capt Mervyn Granshaw says: ?This ground-breaking agreement will allow British, French, 
German and Italian pilots? associations to pool their resources and provide enhanced professional support to 
EasyJet flightcrew [in their respective countries].? The agreement has been arranged ?under the ECA umbrella?, 
says the UK association, but because all the pilots are on British contract, BALPA will be the link organisation 
regarding contract issues, and the local pilots? union will have the necessary knowledge of national conditions and 
employment law to be able to assist pilots at the mainland Europe bases.
EasyJet says it is happy with the arrangement. ?What we did not want was multiple pilot representation, dealing 
with German unions in Germany and French unions in France and so on,? says communications director Toby 
Nicol.
Ryanair, also with 16 European bases, is a BALPA target for a similar pilot representation model, says McAuslan, 
despite the fact that the carrier refuses to recognise any pilot organisation. Each Ryanair pilot is hired on an 
individual local contract, says the Irish Air Line Pilots? Association (IALPA). McAuslan says this is a good time to 
present the Ryanair pilots with a potential representation system, adding that the recent near-total rejection of a 
new pay and conditions offer from the airline was a sign that ?the Ryanair pilot community has decided that enough 
is enough?.

the moment, business is really booming ? we?re doubling our business year-on-year,? he says. ?It?s staggering to 
think of what?s happened since 2001.?
However, despite his bullish point of view, Keane can see problems on the horizon. ?The business had been in 
decline for quite a few years leading up to 2001, and 9/11 was an excuse for airlines to look at their organisations to 
see where costs could be cut.? The rise of the low-cost carriers and their leaner business model has also 
accelerated moves to outsource MRO operations, although that can bring new problems.
Specifically, Keane sees a growing skills shortage ? a result of cutbacks in training over the past few years. The 
organised training programmes that used to provide a steady supply of experienced and well-trained engineers 
have gone. Now military headcounts are down and the focus on security means engineers are being retained. 
Meanwhile, many graduate and apprentice programmes run by original equipment manufacturers and airlines have 
fallen victim to cost-cutting programmes. ?Training was seen as a luxury item ? the responsibility for providing 
trained people fell to the colleges. It?s a demographic time bomb.?
So severe is the situation that Resource Group has started its own apprentice scheme and the first intake of 12 
apprentices will complete their training in July. They should not find trouble getting jobs because, as well as the 
burgeoning MRO sector, large manufacturing programmes such as the Airbus A380 are equally demanding on 
resources. ?We see that side of the business growing by 50-60% in the next six months,? Keane says.
Increasingly, Keane is finding European jobs for engineers from other parts of the world. He is looking for ?anyone 
who can legally work in Europe and has the right skills, aptitude and attitude. We have to think globally now ? we 
can?t just recruit from the UK. We?ll travel to all parts of the globe to identify the right skills.? For the future, the 
aerospace industry needs to make itself more appealing as a career at schools level ? children as young as 10 
should be made aware of the opportunities the industry provides, he believes. 
Keane would like to see more assistance from the UK government in helping specialist organisations such as 
Resource Group set up technical training programmes. ?We want at least a level playing field with academic 
colleges. Academia is not training people for the skills the customer wants.?
The student pilot
Rob Adds is paying to become a pilot and he is confident the investment and risk will be worthwhile. Thirteen 
months in to his course at Cabair?s Cranfield training school in central England, he has just started the multi-engine 
element of the course. ?The job opportunities definitely seem to be improving,? he says. ?There definitely seems to 
be an upward trend.? Adds reckons he is about six weeks away from starting to apply for jobs, but he is confident of 
finding work, as long as he gets a good first-time pass on his instrument rating.
On the rebound
?The market is very competitive, and you do hear stories about some pilots being unemployed for years, but if you 
get good grades you tend to get snapped up. I?m hoping to be recommended by Cabair to one of the airlines they 
have strong links with ? British Airways or Flybe. And I?ll be getting my CV off to other airlines too.? 
Adds is hoping for a first officer?s job on turboprops as a first job, which should net him around ?20,000-25,000 
($37,000-46,000) a year. If all goes according to plan it should take six to seven years to rise through the ranks to 
jet captain. He is also looking at the business jet sector ? another growing area. ?I?m reasonably upbeat about 
getting a job,? he says.
If he can not get a job straight away, there is a Plan B. ?If I?m still unemployed after six months I?ll take a flight 
instructor?s course and try and build some hours and practise teaching.? Adds has wanted to fly since he was a 
schoolboy, and joined the Manchester and Salford University Air Squadron to get some basic training when he was 
a student. When some of his squadron colleagues got jobs at airlines, Adds decided to follow them, taking an office 
job to earn the cash to fund his training.
?I?m just happy to be flying. If someone says ?Fly my Cessna and I?ll pay for your flight instructor course?, that?ll 
be fine by me,? he says.
The headhunter
Recruitment consultancy CBSbutler specialises in finding technical and engineering personnel for a wide range of 
aerospace companies, ranging from MRO operations to manufacturers and suppliers. But while the market is 
booming, it is going through several shifts in emphasis, believes managing director Dave Leyshon. Finding the right 
candidate for the job is not as easy at it seems. In the MRO area, there has been a significant recovery post-9/11. 
But the market is changing. ?Cost is a big challenge,? says Leyshon. ?A lot of bread-and-butter work has been 
shipped off to low-cost regions in eastern Europe and the Far East ? sending work away from Europe.?
So while there are plenty of job opportunities for MRO engineers, they are not necessarily conveniently located. 
Leyshon believes that is not a problem, as Europe offers opportunities elsewhere. ?We?re seeing significant 
demand all round. We?re now placing people who previously worked in MRO into the manufacturing side, into large 
projects like the Airbus A380. All the aircraft manufacturers are expanding their ranges and there is significant 
demand for engineers ? the skill sets are common to MRO and manufacturing.?
The manufacturing sector is going to continue to provide plenty of employment opportunities in the future, thanks to 
a number of driving forces ? emissions regulations, cost and weight reductions and the need for all-new aircraft 
ranges, with Airbus and Boeing both needing to replace their short-range single-aisle jet ranges in the near- to-mid-
term.
These aircraft will include plenty of new and unfamiliar technologies, generating a need within the aerospace sector 
for different skill sets, such as computer engineers. CBSbutler is placing increasing numbers of people from non-
aerospace backgrounds, such as software engineers from the computer industry. These skills are especially in 
demand in the defence sector, where demand for technologists is ?insatiable?, Leyshon says.
He says there is evidence of a return to formal graduate recruitment programmes. Airlines are again looking to 
recruit management graduate trainees, he says, and CBSbutler has just completed a programme for MBDA, the 
European missiles company owned by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica, that involved recruiting more than 
100 graduate engineers.
Also for MBDA, CBSbutler is to headhunt 50 experienced managers to help run programmes to strict cost 
structures for demanding customers such as the UK Ministry of Defence. ?They recognise the need to strengthen 
their capability to manage large programmes,? Leyshon says.
The low-cost carrier
On the rebound
Repositioning itself as a low-fares airline in 2002 has proved a successful decision for regional carrier Flybe, based 
at Exeter, south-west England. The airline has expanded rapidly, with a fleet of 44 Bombardier Q400 twin 
turboprops on order ? 25 have so far been delivered ? and a dozen or so BAe 146s. These jets are due to be 
replaced from this August by Embraer 195 twinjets.
With this expansion has come the need to recruit aircrew, but there seems to be no shortage of suitable candidates, 
believes Capt Ian Cheese, general manager, turboprop. ?We are planning to recruit around 130 pilots a year to fuel 
our expansion needs, and there continues to be a large number of low-hour pilots to select from.?
Cheese says Flybe has always had a lot of interest from low-hour pilots in joining the airline. ?An online application 
form attracted 1,300 applicants in eight weeks.? All pilots joining the carrier start on the turboprop fleet, flying 
Q400s. However, Cheese says it is relatively easy to step up to jets. ?The Q400 performs in many respects like a 
jet of a similar size.?
Flybe has also become one of the first airlines to restart sponsored pilot training. ?We currently run a partial 
sponsorship scheme with Cabair and a mentor airline pilot scheme with Flight Training Europe,? says Cheese. With 
the Cabair scheme, Flybe funds ?20,000 of the ?55,000 course costs. Six students a year are sponsored this way 
and in the first two years all have been taken on by Flybe. The mentored pilots receive about ?7,000, and some 
extra training is paid for by Flybe once they have completed the course.
Such programmes give the airline better control, Cheese believes. ?These schemes ensure that we achieve quality 
control from a very early stage as we are part of the selection process from the outset.? In addition, non-sponsored 
students are also being recruited directly after finishing their courses. ?We draw both integrated and ?one stop? 
modular students from five UK flight training organisations on recommendation,? says Cheese, who is also 
prepared to look further afield and hire non-UK pilots. ?We hire pilots with a JAA licence and the right to live and 
work in the UK.?
One problem for carriers with large turbo?prop fleets is retaining aircrew. Given the thirst for pilots among large 
carriers and rival jet-based low-fares airlines, it is inevitable that some of Flybe?s pilots are lured elsewhere. 
Cheese is philosophical: ?I would not use the term ?poaching?. Pilots aspire to different things and there will always 
be a group that wish to fly different aeroplanes, work closer to home or overseas, or fly in a different environment. 
That has always been the way in aviation.?
Cheese says Flybe can offer a fast track to a captain?s job. ?A commander?s salary here will exceed a first 
officer?s pay on a 757,? he says. Some pilots have progressed within around three years. ?We have some young 
captains, including one 24-year-old who wasn?t old enough to hire a car.?
The long-haul airline
The current spike in demand for air travel has seen passenger traffic in the first four months of 2006 running 7% up 
on last year, while airliner manufacturers are reporting record deliveries. Among the biggest winners from this 
market boom are the large Middle Eastern carriers, with more than half the widebodied aircraft to be delivered over 
the next 16 years estimated as going to airlines in the region.
Rick Helliwell, vice-president of recruitment for one of the fastest-growing airlines in the region, Emirates, has a job 
on his hands managing the company?s need for staff. He is looking to recruit 300 aircrew this year alone, mainly to 
service growth; Emirates is adding 14 widebodied jets to its fleet this year.
And as Emirates? policy is only to recruit experienced aircrew, he has to rely on the reputation of the airline, plus 
the appeal of the Dubai lifestyle, to get the best candidates. ?We get a steady flow of applications ? pilots can 
register their interest in working for Emirates online. But a lot of applicants don?t have sufficient experience. We 
look for 4,000h, including 2,000h on multi-engine jets.?
On the rebound
Applicants undergo a thorough interview process, including flight simulators and psychometric testing. Only about 
half of those interviewed make the grade, says Helliwell, but as those hired already have plenty of hours, the route 
from first officer to captain is quick ? three to four years.
Whereas Emirates was able to hang on to its aircrew in the immediate post-9/11 period, Helliwell has noticed an 
increased turnover in aircrew recently as demand has picked up in other regions. ?China needs thousands of pilots 
over the next few years, and there could be a pilot shortage soon in the USA,? he says. ?It?s getting more 
challenging to attract the right people.? Emirates casts its net far afield when it hires pilots, including as far away as 
South America and Australasia ? Helliwell himself is a New Zealander.
Emirates? thirst for new recruits is not just confined to aircrew. The airline has opted not to outsource MRO, and is 
building a massive new maintenance hangar in Dubai to service its A380 fleet. ?We?re also hiring engineers and 
mechanics from all over the world,? says Helliwell. ?We need to cope with the growing numbers of aircraft, plus the 
extra areas of specialisation on the aircraft ? for example in-flight entertainment specialists.?
Emirates Group has become a diverse organisation, managing all ground handling at Dubai airport in addition to its 
large air cargo and IT divisions. ?We?re recruiting 4,000-5,000 people across the whole organisation this year.? 
Many are cabin crew, with Emirates hiring between 60 and 80 new cabin staff each week. ?We need more than 
10,000 new cabin staff in the next five years,? says Helliwell.
Not even ?another 9/11? will dent the growth projections, he believes. ?You can?t stop evolution, only dent it. The 
trends for the global economy and global mobility are rising ? so the future looks bright.? n

Body
The first few years of the 21st century were tough for the aerospace industry. The events of 9/11, plus other crises 
such as the SARS virus in China, depressed the market and cause wholesale cutbacks. But the industry has 
bounced back rapidly ? so much so, that it now looks like 9/11 was an excuse for many companies to make 
overdue streamlining to their operations. And 9/11 has resulted in an increased focus on defence and security, 
creating opportunities in the high-tech areas of the aerospace industry.
Meanwhile, the airline business has resumed the growth trend that was evident before the terrorist attacks. Driven 
by low-cost carriers, air travel is booming, and this is creating a considerable demand for aircrew and engineering 
staff to support the growing airliner fleets. Can anything prick this bubble of optimism, or are the various players in 
the aircraft industry right to feel upbeat? It seems there is a positive consensus from a lot of the players involved.
The trainer
Pilot training was hit hard by the events of 11 September 2001 ? but now it has bounced back in no uncertain 
terms, believes Graham Austin, chief executive of UK pilot training school Cabair.
?This year has been one of the best opportunities for pilots for some time,? he says. There had been a gradual 
increase in recruitment since 9/11, but now I believe we?re in a new dimension.? The demand for aircrew has 
bounced back because of a ?potent mix of factors?, Austin believes ? and now pilots are in short supply.
?The low-cost airlines are still growing, but more significantly the economies in the Middle East, India and China are 
growing at such a rate. We didn?t imagine there?d be such an opportunity,? he says. As a result, Cranfield-based 
Cabair is increasingly finding jobs for pilots at airlines such as Kuwait Airlines and Royal Brunei. 
But one thing has changed since 9/11 ? airlines are no longer prepared to pay for pilot training. The message is 
clear for young pilots ? you will have to find the money to fund your own training, but providing you put the work in, 
there are plenty of jobs out there. ?We?re not seeing added interest in airlines spending money on training,? Austin 
says.
Heavy demand
Austin is finding that the opportunities for pilots are well-paid, too. Low-cost airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair 
may have sliced costs out of many areas of their business, but they have not scrimped on aircrew salaries ? so 
much so that smaller turboprop operators have a hard job hanging on to pilots when the low-cost carriers come 
calling for jet captains and first officers.
The downside for pilots joining the low-cost carriers is they will have to work their maximum 900h a year, thanks to 
sophisticated computerised rostering systems that the airlines use to sweat their assets to the maximum.
While the bar is still set high with regard to training in developed markets, Barber fears there might be a slackening 
of standards in emerging markets as airlines scramble to find enough pilots. ?They could copy the low-cost model, 
but without a firm grip on quality,? he says. Barber sees the aircrew jobs market remaining strong, so long as 
another major disaster does not hit the airline business. ?Another 9/11 is the spectre on the horizon. That could kill 
off growth again,? he says.
The labour provider
With more than 800 engineers working on contract in the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector, 
Resource Group commercial director Bob Keane is well-placed to gauge the health of the engineering sector. ?At

The European Cockpit Association (ECA) has set up a system for representing pilots? interests across multiple-
base pan-European airlines. This has already been arranged for EasyJet crews, says the British Air Line Pilots 
Association (BALPA), and the organisation has set its sights on doing the same for Ryanair pilots.
BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan says ?there is no European employment law which is portable [across 
national borders], even though there are [pan-European] corporate laws?. EasyJet has 16 bases in Europe where 
the crew are either hired locally or are expatriates living there, but all of them are on a contract drawn up under UK 
employment law.
BALPA chairman Capt Mervyn Granshaw says: ?This ground-breaking agreement will allow British, French, 
German and Italian pilots? associations to pool their resources and provide enhanced professional support to 
EasyJet flightcrew [in their respective countries].? The agreement has been arranged ?under the ECA umbrella?, 
says the UK association, but because all the pilots are on British contract, BALPA will be the link organisation 
regarding contract issues, and the local pilots? union will have the necessary knowledge of national conditions and 
employment law to be able to assist pilots at the mainland Europe bases.
EasyJet says it is happy with the arrangement. ?What we did not want was multiple pilot representation, dealing 
with German unions in Germany and French unions in France and so on,? says communications director Toby 
Nicol.
Ryanair, also with 16 European bases, is a BALPA target for a similar pilot representation model, says McAuslan, 
despite the fact that the carrier refuses to recognise any pilot organisation. Each Ryanair pilot is hired on an 
individual local contract, says the Irish Air Line Pilots? Association (IALPA). McAuslan says this is a good time to 
present the Ryanair pilots with a potential representation system, adding that the recent near-total rejection of a 
new pay and conditions offer from the airline was a sign that ?the Ryanair pilot community has decided that enough 
is enough?.

BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan says ?there is no European employment law which is portable [across 
national borders], even though there are [pan-European] corporate laws?. EasyJet has 16 bases in Europe where 
the crew are either hired locally or are expatriates living there, but all of them are on a contract drawn up under UK 
employment law.
BALPA chairman Capt Mervyn Granshaw says: ?This ground-breaking agreement will allow British, French, 
German and Italian pilots? associations to pool their resources and provide enhanced professional support to 
EasyJet flightcrew [in their respective countries].? The agreement has been arranged ?under the ECA umbrella?, 
says the UK association, but because all the pilots are on British contract, BALPA will be the link organisation 
regarding contract issues, and the local pilots? union will have the necessary knowledge of national conditions and 
employment law to be able to assist pilots at the mainland Europe bases.
EasyJet says it is happy with the arrangement. ?What we did not want was multiple pilot representation, dealing 
with German unions in Germany and French unions in France and so on,? says communications director Toby 
Nicol.
Ryanair, also with 16 European bases, is a BALPA target for a similar pilot representation model, says McAuslan, 
despite the fact that the carrier refuses to recognise any pilot organisation. Each Ryanair pilot is hired on an 
individual local contract, says the Irish Air Line Pilots? Association (IALPA). McAuslan says this is a good time to 
present the Ryanair pilots with a potential representation system, adding that the recent near-total rejection of a 
new pay and conditions offer from the airline was a sign that ?the Ryanair pilot community has decided that enough 
is enough?.

The first few years of the 21st century were tough for the aerospace industry. The events of 9/11, plus other crises 
such as the SARS virus in Asia, depressed the market and caused wholesale cutbacks. But the industry has 
bounced back rapidly ? so much so, that it now looks like 9/11 was an excuse for many companies to make 
overdue streamlining to their operations. And 9/11 has resulted in an increased focus on defence and security, 
creating opportunities in high-tech areas of aerospace.
Meanwhile, the airline business has resumed the growth evident before the attacks. Air travel is booming, and this 
is creating demand for aircrew and engineering staff to support growing fleets. Can anything prick this bubble of 
optimism? It seems there is a positive consensus from many in the industry.
The trainer
Pilot training was hit hard by the events of 11 September 2001 ? but now it has bounced back in no uncertain 
terms, believes Graham Austin, chief executive of UK pilot training school Cabair.
?This year has been one of the best opportunities for pilots for some time,? he says. ?There had been a gradual 
increase in recruitment since 9/11, but now I believe we?re in a new dimension.? The demand for aircrew has 
bounced back because of a ?potent mix of factors?, Austin believes ? and now pilots are in short supply.
?The low-cost airlines are still growing, but more significantly the economies in the Middle East, India and China are 
growing at such a rate. We didn? imagine there?d be such an opportunity,? he says. As a result, Cranfield-based 
Cabair is increasingly finding jobs for pilots at airlines such as Kuwait Airlines and Royal Brunei.
But one thing has changed since 9/11 ? airlines are no longer prepared to pay for pilot training. The message is 
clear for young pilots ? you will have to find the money to fund your own training, but providing you put the work in, 
there are plenty of jobs out there. ?We?re not seeing added interest in airlines spending money on training,? Austin 
says.
On the rebound.
Austin finds that the opportunities for pilots are well-paid, too. Low-cost airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair may 
have sliced costs out of many areas of their business, but they have not scrimped on aircrew salaries ? so much so 
that smaller turboprop operators have a hard job hanging on to pilots when the low-cost carriers come calling for jet 
captains and first officers.
The downside for pilots joining the low-cost carriers is they will have to work their maximum 900 flying hours a year, 
thanks to sophisticated computerised rostering systems that the airlines use to sweat their assets to the maximum.
While the bar is still set high with regard to training in developed markets, Austin fears there might be a slackening 
of standards in emerging markets as airlines scramble to find enough pilots. ?They could copy the low-cost model, 
but without a firm grip on quality,? he says. Austin sees the aircrew jobs market remaining strong, so long as 
another major disaster does not hit the airline business. ?Another 9/11 is the spectre on the horizon. That could kill 
off growth again,? he says.
The labour provider
With more than 800 engineers working on contract in the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector, 
Resource Group commercial director Bob Keane is well placed to gauge the health of the engineering sector. ?At 
the moment, business is really booming ? we?re doubling our business year-on-year,? he says. ?It? staggering to 
think of what? happened since 2001.?
However, despite his bullish point of view, Keane can see problems on the horizon. ?The business had been in 
decline for quite a few years leading up to 2001, and 9/11 was an excuse for airlines to look at their organisations to 
see where costs could be cut.? The rise of the low-cost carriers and their leaner business model has also 
accelerated moves to outsource MRO operations, although that can bring new problems.
Specifically, Keane sees a growing skills shortage ? a result of cutbacks in training over the past few years. The 
organised training programmes that used to provide a steady supply of experienced and well-trained engineers 
have gone. Now military headcounts are down and the focus on security means engineers are being retained. 
Meanwhile, many graduate and apprentice programmes run by original equipment manufacturers and airlines have 
fallen victim to cost-cutting programmes. ?Training was seen as a luxury item ? the responsibility for providing 
trained people fell to the colleges. It? a demographic time bomb.?
So severe is the situation that Resource Group has started its own apprentice scheme and the first intake of 12 
apprentices will complete their training in July. They should not find trouble getting jobs because, as well as the 
burgeoning MRO sector, large manufacturing programmes such as the Airbus A380 are equally demanding on 
resources. ?We see that side of the business growing by 50-60% in the next six months,? Keane says.
Increasingly, Keane is finding European jobs for engineers from other parts of the world. He is looking for ?anyone 
who can legally work in Europe and has the right skills, aptitude and attitude. We have to think globally now ? we 
can? just recruit from the UK. We?ll travel to all parts of the globe to identify the right skills.? For the future, the 
aerospace industry needs to make itself more appealing as a career at schools level ? children as young as 10 
should be made aware of the opportunities the industry provides, he believes.
Keane would like to see more assistance from the UK government in helping specialist organisations such as 
Resource Group set up technical training programmes. ?We want at least a level playing field with academic 
colleges. Academia is not training people for the skills the customer wants.?
The student pilot
Rob Adds is paying to become a pilot and he is confident the investment and risk will be worthwhile. Thirteen 
months in to his course at Cabair? Cranfield training school in central England, he has just started the multi-engine 
element of the course. ?The job opportunities definitely seem to be improving,? he says. ?There definitely seems to 
be an upward trend.? Adds reckons he is about six weeks away from starting to apply for jobs, but he is confident of 
finding work, as long as he gets a good first-time pass on his instrument rating.
On the rebound.
?The market is very competitive, and you do hear stories about some pilots being unemployed for years, but if you 
get good grades you tend to get snapped up. I?m hoping to be recommended by Cabair to one of the airlines they 
have strong links with ? British Airways or Flybe. And I?ll be getting my CV off to other airlines too.?
Adds is hoping for a first officer? job on turboprops as a first job, which should net him around ?20,000-25,000 
($37,000-46,000) a year. If all goes according to plan it should take six to seven years to rise through the ranks to 
jet captain. He is also looking at the business jet sector ? another growing area. ?I?m reasonably upbeat about 
getting a job,? he says.
If he can not get a job straight away, there is a Plan B. ?If I?m still unemployed after six months I?ll take a flight 
instructor? course and try and build some hours and practise teaching.? Adds has wanted to fly since he was a 
schoolboy, and joined the Manchester and Salford University Air Squadron to get some basic training when he was 
a student. When some of his squadron colleagues got jobs at airlines, Adds decided to follow them, taking an office 
job to earn the cash to fund his training.
?I?m just happy to be flying. If someone says ?Fly my Cessna and I?ll pay for your flight instructor course?, that?ll 
be fine by me,? he says.
The headhunter
Recruitment consultancy CBSbutler specialises in finding technical and engineering personnel for a wide range of 
aerospace companies, ranging from MRO operations to manufacturers and suppliers. But while the market is 
booming, it is going through several shifts in emphasis, believes managing director Dave Leyshon. Finding the right 
candidate for the job is not as easy at it seems. In the MRO area, there has been a significant recovery post-9/11. 
But the market is changing. ?Cost is a big challenge,? says Leyshon. ?A lot of bread-and-butter work has been 
shipped off to low-cost regions in eastern Europe and the Far East ? sending work away from Europe.?
So while there are plenty of job opportunities for MRO engineers, they are not necessarily conveniently located. 
Leyshon believes that is not a problem, as Europe offers opportunities elsewhere. ?We?re seeing significant 
demand all round. We?re now placing people who previously worked in MRO into the manufacturing side, into large 
projects like the Airbus A380. All the aircraft manufacturers are expanding their ranges and there is significant 
demand for engineers ? the skill sets are common to MRO and manufacturing.?
The manufacturing sector is going to continue to provide plenty of employment opportunities in the future, thanks to 
a number of driving forces ? emissions regulations, cost and weight reductions and the need for all-new aircraft 
ranges, with Airbus and Boeing both needing to replace their short-range single-aisle jet ranges in the near- to-mid-
term.
These aircraft will include plenty of new and unfamiliar technologies, generating a need within the aerospace sector 
for different skill sets, such as computer engineers. CBSbutler is placing increasing numbers of people from non-
aerospace backgrounds, such as software engineers from the computer industry. These skills are especially in 
demand in the defence sector, where demand for technologists is ?insatiable?, Leyshon says.
He says there is evidence of a return to formal graduate recruitment programmes. Airlines are again looking to 
recruit management graduate trainees, he says, and CBSbutler has just completed a programme for MBDA, the 
European missiles company owned by BAE Systems, EADS and Finmeccanica, that involved recruiting more than 
100 graduate engineers.
Also for MBDA, CBSbutler is to headhunt 50 experienced managers to help run programmes to strict cost 
structures for demanding customers such as the UK Ministry of Defence. ?They recognise the need to strengthen 
their capability to manage large programmes,? Leyshon says.
The low-cost carrier
On the rebound.
Repositioning itself as a low-fares airline in 2002 has proved a successful decision for regional carrier Flybe, based 
at Exeter, south-west England. The airline has expanded rapidly, with a fleet of 44 Bombardier Q400 twin 
turboprops on order ? 25 have so far been delivered ? and a dozen or so BAe 146s. These jets are due to be 
replaced from this August by Embraer 195 twinjets.
With this expansion has come the need to recruit aircrew, but there seems to be no shortage of suitable candidates, 
believes Capt Ian Cheese, general manager, turboprop. ?We are planning to recruit around 130 pilots a year to fuel 
our expansion needs, and there continues to be a large number of low-hour pilots to select from.?
Cheese says Flybe has always had a lot of interest from low-hour pilots in joining the airline. ?An online application 
form attracted 1,300 applicants in eight weeks.? All pilots joining the carrier start on the turboprop fleet, flying 
Q400s. However, Cheese says it is relatively easy to step up to jets. ?The Q400 performs in many respects like a 
jet of a similar size.?
Flybe has also become one of the first airlines to restart sponsored pilot training. ?We currently run a partial 
sponsorship scheme with Cabair and a mentor airline pilot scheme with Flight Training Europe,? says Cheese. With 
the Cabair scheme, Flybe funds ?20,000 of the ?55,000 course costs. Six students a year are sponsored this way 
and in the first two years all have been taken on by Flybe. The mentored pilots receive about ?7,000, and some 
extra training is paid for by Flybe once they have completed the course.
Such programmes give the airline better control, Cheese believes. ?These schemes ensure that we achieve quality 
control from a very early stage as we are part of the selection process from the outset.? In addition, non-sponsored 
students are also being recruited directly after finishing their courses. ?We draw both integrated and ?one stop? 
modular students from five UK flight training organisations on recommendation,? says Cheese, who is also 
prepared to look further afield and hire non-UK pilots. ?We hire pilots with a JAA licence and the right to live and 
work in the UK.?
One problem for carriers with large turbo?prop fleets is retaining aircrew. Given the thirst for pilots among large 
carriers and rival jet-based low-fares airlines, it is inevitable that some of Flybe? pilots are lured elsewhere. Cheese 
is philosophical: ?I would not use the term ?poaching?. Pilots aspire to different things and there will always be a 
group that wish to fly different aeroplanes, work closer to home or overseas, or fly in a different environment. That 
has always been the way in aviation.?
Cheese says Flybe can offer a fast track to a captain? job. ?A commander? salary here will exceed a first officer? 
pay on a 757,? he says. Some pilots have progressed within around three years. ?We have some young captains, 
including one 24-year-old who wasn? old enough to hire a car.?
The long-haul airline
The current spike in demand for air travel has seen passenger traffic in the first four months of 2006 running 7% up 
on last year, while airliner manufacturers are reporting record deliveries. Among the biggest winners from this 
market boom are the large Middle Eastern carriers, with more than half the widebodied aircraft to be delivered over 
the next 16 years estimated as going to airlines in the region.
Rick Helliwell, vice-president of recruitment for one of the fastest-growing airlines in the region, Emirates, has a job 
on his hands managing the company? need for staff. He is looking to recruit 300 aircrew this year alone, mainly to 
service growth; Emirates is adding 14 widebodied jets to its fleet this year.
And as Emirates? policy is only to recruit experienced aircrew, he has to rely on the reputation of the airline, plus 
the appeal of the Dubai lifestyle, to get the best candidates. ?We get a steady flow of applications ? pilots can 
register their interest in working for Emirates online. But a lot of applicants don? have sufficient experience. We look 
for 4,000h, including 2,000h on multi-engine jets.?
On the rebound.
Applicants undergo a thorough interview process, including flight simulators and psychometric testing. Only about 
half of those interviewed make the grade, says Helliwell, but as those hired already have plenty of hours, the route 
from first officer to captain is quick ? three to four years.
Whereas Emirates was able to hang on to its aircrew in the immediate post-9/11 period, Helliwell has noticed an 
increased turnover in aircrew recently as demand has picked up in other regions. ?China needs thousands of pilots 
over the next few years, and there could be a pilot shortage soon in the USA,? he says. ?It? getting more 
challenging to attract the right people.? Emirates casts its net far afield when it hires pilots, including as far away as 
South America and Australasia ? Helliwell himself is a New Zealander.
Emirates? thirst for new recruits is not just confined to aircrew. The airline has opted not to outsource MRO, and is 
building a massive new maintenance hangar in Dubai to service its A380 fleet. ?We?re also hiring engineers and 
mechanics from all over the world,? says Helliwell. ?We need to cope with the growing numbers of aircraft, plus the 
extra areas of specialisation on the aircraft ? for example in-flight entertainment specialists.?
Emirates Group has become a diverse organisation, managing all ground handling at Dubai airport in addition to its 
large air cargo and IT divisions. ?We?re recruiting 4,000-5,000 people across the whole organisation this year.? 
Many are cabin crew, with Emirates hiring between 60 and 80 new cabin staff each week. ?We need more than 
10,000 new cabin staff in the next five years,? says Helliwell.
Not even ?another 9/11? will dent the growth projections, he believes. ?You can? stop evolution, only dent it. The 
trends for the global economy and global mobility are rising ? so the future looks bright.?

On the rebound.
Applicants undergo a thorough interview process, including flight simulators and psychometric testing. Only about 
half of those interviewed make the grade, says Helliwell, but as those hired already have plenty of hours, the route 
from first officer to captain is quick ? three to four years.
Whereas Emirates was able to hang on to its aircrew in the immediate post-9/11 period, Helliwell has noticed an 
increased turnover in aircrew recently as demand has picked up in other regions. ?China needs thousands of pilots 
over the next few years, and there could be a pilot shortage soon in the USA,? he says. ?It? getting more 
challenging to attract the right people.? Emirates casts its net far afield when it hires pilots, including as far away as 
South America and Australasia ? Helliwell himself is a New Zealander.
Emirates? thirst for new recruits is not just confined to aircrew. The airline has opted not to outsource MRO, and is 
building a massive new maintenance hangar in Dubai to service its A380 fleet. ?We?re also hiring engineers and 
mechanics from all over the world,? says Helliwell. ?We need to cope with the growing numbers of aircraft, plus the 
extra areas of specialisation on the aircraft ? for example in-flight entertainment specialists.?
Emirates Group has become a diverse organisation, managing all ground handling at Dubai airport in addition to its 
large air cargo and IT divisions. ?We?re recruiting 4,000-5,000 people across the whole organisation this year.? 
Many are cabin crew, with Emirates hiring between 60 and 80 new cabin staff each week. ?We need more than 
10,000 new cabin staff in the next five years,? says Helliwell.
Not even ?another 9/11? will dent the growth projections, he believes. ?You can? stop evolution, only dent it. The 
trends for the global economy and global mobility are rising ? so the future looks bright.?

Body
The first few years of the 21st century were tough for the aerospace industry. The events of 9/11, plus other crises 
such as the SARS virus in China, depressed the market and cause wholesale cutbacks. But the industry has 
bounced back rapidly ? so much so, that it now looks like 9/11 was an excuse for many companies to make 
overdue streamlining to their operations. And 9/11 has resulted in an increased focus on defence and security, 
creating opportunities in the high-tech areas of the aerospace industry.
Meanwhile, the airline business has resumed the growth trend that was evident before the terrorist attacks. Driven 
by low-cost carriers, air travel is booming, and this is creating a considerable demand for aircrew and engineering 
staff to support the growing airliner fleets. Can anything prick this bubble of optimism, or are the various players in 
the aircraft industry right to feel upbeat? It seems there is a positive consensus from a lot of the players involved.
The trainer
Pilot training was hit hard by the events of 11 September 2001 ? but now it has bounced back in no uncertain 
terms, believes Graham Austin, chief executive of UK pilot training school Cabair.
?This year has been one of the best opportunities for pilots for some time,? he says. There had been a gradual 
increase in recruitment since 9/11, but now I believe we?re in a new dimension.? The demand for aircrew has 
bounced back because of a ?potent mix of factors?, Austin believes ? and now pilots are in short supply.
?The low-cost airlines are still growing, but more significantly the economies in the Middle East, India and China are 
growing at such a rate. We didn? imagine there?d be such an opportunity,? he says. As a result, Cranfield-based 
Cabair is increasingly finding jobs for pilots at airlines such as Kuwait Airlines and Royal Brunei.
But one thing has changed since 9/11 ? airlines are no longer prepared to pay for pilot training. The message is 
clear for young pilots ? you will have to find the money to fund your own training, but providing you put the work in, 
there are plenty of jobs out there. ?We?re not seeing added interest in airlines spending money on training,? Austin 
says.
Heavy demand.
Austin is finding that the opportunities for pilots are well-paid, too. Low-cost airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair 
may have sliced costs out of many areas of their business, but they have not scrimped on aircrew salaries ? so 
much so that smaller turboprop operators have a hard job hanging on to pilots when the low-cost carriers come 
calling for jet captains and first officers.
The downside for pilots joining the low-cost carriers is they will have to work their maximum 900h a year, thanks to 
sophisticated computerised rostering systems that the airlines use to sweat their assets to the maximum.
While the bar is still set high with regard to training in developed markets, Barber fears there might be a slackening 
of standards in emerging markets as airlines scramble to find enough pilots. ?They could copy the low-cost model, 
but without a firm grip on quality,? he says. Barber sees the aircrew jobs market remaining strong, so long as 
another major disaster does not hit the airline business. ?Another 9/11 is the spectre on the horizon. That could kill 
off growth again,? he says.
The labour provider
With more than 800 engineers working on contract in the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) sector, 
Resource Group commercial director Bob Keane is well-placed to gauge the health of the engineering sector. ?At 
the moment, business is really booming ? we?re doubling our business year-on-year,? he says. ?It? staggering to 
think of what? happened since 2001.?
However, despite his bullish point of view, Keane can see problems on the horizon. ?The business had been in 
decline for quite a few years leading up to 2001, and 9/11 was an excuse for airlines to look at their organisations to 
see where costs could be cut.? The rise of the low-cost carriers and their leaner business model has also 
accelerated moves to outsource MRO operations, although that can bring new problems.
Specifically, Keane sees a growing skills shortage ? a result of cutbacks in training over the past few years. The 
organised training programmes that used to provide a steady supply of experienced and well trained engineers 
have gone. Now military headcounts are down and the focus on security means engineers are being retained. 
Meanwhile, many graduate and apprentice programmes run by original equipment manufacturers and airlines have 
fallen victim to cost-cutting programmes. ?Training was seen as a luxury item ? the responsibility for providing 
trained people fell to the colleges. It? a demographic time bomb.?
So severe is the situation that Resource Group has started its own apprentice scheme and the first intake of 12 
apprentices will complete their training in July. They should not find trouble getting jobs because as well as the 
burgeoning MRO sector, large manufacturing programmes such as the Airbus A380 are equally demanding on 
resources. ?We see that side of the business growing by 50-60% in the next six months,? Keane says.
Increasingly, Keane is finding European jobs for engineers from other parts of the world. He is looking for ?anyone 
who can legally work in Europe and has the right skills, aptitude and attitude. We have to think globally now ? we 
can? just recruit from the UK. We?ll travel to all parts of the globe to identify the right skills.? For the future, the 
aerospace industry needs to make itself more appealing as a career at schools level ? children as young as 10 
should be made aware of the opportunities the industry provides, he believes.
Keane would like to see more assistance from the UK government in helping specialist organisations such as 
Resource Group set up technical training programmes. ?We want at least a level playing field with academic 
colleges. Academia is not training people for the skills the customer wants.?
The student pilot
Rob Adds is paying to become a pilot and he is confident the investment and risk will be worthwhile. Thirteen 
months in to his course at Cabair? Cranfield training school in central England, he has just started the multi-engine 
element of the course. ?The job opportunities definitely seem to be improving,? he said. ?There definitely seems to 
be an upward trend.? He reckons he is about six weeks away from starting to apply for jobs, but he is confident of 
finding work, as long as he gets a good first-time pass on his instrument rating.
Heavy demand.
?The market is very competitive, and you do hear stories about some pilots being unemployed for years, but if you 
get good grades you tend to get snapped up. I?m hoping to be recommended by Cabair to one of the airlines they 
have strong links with ? British Airways or Flybe. And I?ll be getting my CV off to other airlines too.?
Realistically, Adds is hoping for a first officer? job on turboprops as a first job, which should net him around 
?20,000-25,000 ($37,000-46,000) a year. If all goes according to plan it should take six to seven years to rise 
through the ranks to jet captain. He is also looking at the business jet sector ? another growing area. ?I?m 
reasonably upbeat about getting a job,? he says.
If he can not get a job straight away, there is a Plan B. ?If I?m still unemployed after six months I?ll take a flight 
instructor? course and try and build some hours and practise teaching.? Adds has wanted to fly since he was a 
schoolboy, and joined the Manchester and Salford University Air Squadron to get some basic training when he was 
a student. When some of his squadron colleagues got jobs at airlines, Adds decided to follow them, taking an office 
job to earn the cash to fund his training.
?I?m just happy to be flying. If someone says ?fly my Cessna and I?ll pay for your flight instructor course?, that?ll 
be fine by me,? he says.
The headhunter
Recruitment consultancy CBSbutler specialises in finding technical and engineering personnel for a wide range of 
aerospace companies, ranging from MRO operations to manufacturers and suppliers. But while the market is 
booming, it is going through several shifts in emphasis, believes managing director Dave Leyshon. Finding the right 
candidate for the job is not as easy at it seems. In the MRO area, there has been a significant recovery post-9/11. 
But the market is changing. ?Cost is a big challenge,? says Leyshon. ?A lot of bread-and-butter work has been 
shipped off to low-cost regions in eastern Europe and the Far East ? sending work away from Europe.?
So while there are plenty of job opportunities for MRO engineers, they are not necessarily conveniently located. 
Leyshon believes that is not a problem, as Europe offers plenty of opportunities elsewhere. ?We?re seeing 
significant demand all round. We?re now placing people who previously worked in MRO into the manufacturing 
side, into large projects like the Airbus A380. All the aircraft manufacturers are expanding their ranges and there us 
significant demand for engineers ? the skill sets are common to MRO and manufacturing.?
The manufacturing sector is going to continue to provide plenty of employment opportunities in the future, thanks to 
a number of driving forces ? emissions regulations, cost and weight reductions and the need for all-new aircraft 
ranges, with Airbus and Boeing both needing to replace their main short-range single-aisle jet ranges in the near- 
to-mid-term.
These aircraft will include plenty of new and unfamiliar technologies, generating a need within the aerospace sector 
for different skill sets, such as computer engineers. CBSbutler is placing increasing numbers of people from non-
aerospace backgrounds, such as software engineers from the computer industry. These skills are especially in 
demand in the defence sector, where demand for technologists is ?insatiable?, Leyshon says.
Encouragingly, he says there is evidence of a return to formal graduate recruitment programmes. Airlines are again 
looking to recruit management graduate trainees, he says, and CBSbutler has just completed a programme for 
MBDA, the European missiles joint venture between EADS, BAE Systems and Finmeccanica, that involved 
recruiting more than 100 graduate engineers.
Also for MBDA, CBSbutler is to headhunt 50 experienced managers to help run programmes to strict cost 
structures for demanding customers such as the UK Ministry of Defence. ?They recognise the need to strengthen 
their capability to manage large programmes,? Leyshon says.
The low-cost carrier
Heavy demand.
Repositioning itself as a low-fares airline in 2002 has proved a successful decision for regional carrier Flybe, based 
at Exeter, south-west England. The airline has expanded rapidly, with a fleet of 44 Bombardier Q400 twin 
turboprops on order ? 25 have so far been delivered ? and a dozen or so BAE Systems 146s. These jets are due to 
be replaced from this August by Embraer 195 twinjets.
With this expansion has come the need to recruit aircrew, but there seems to be no shortage of suitable candidates, 
believes Captain Ian Cheese, general manager turboprop. ?We are currently planning to recruit around 130 pilots a 
year to fuel our expansion needs, and there continues to be a large number of low-hour pilots to select from.?
Cheese says Flybe has always had a lot of interest from low-hour pilots in joining the airline. ?An online application 
form attracted 1,300 applicants in eight weeks.? All pilots joining the carrier start on the turboprop fleet, flying 
Q400s. However, Cheese says it is relatively easy to step up to jets. ?The Q400 is performs in many respects like a 
jet of a similar size.?
Flybe has also become one of the first airlines to restart sponsored pilot training. ?We currently run a partial 
sponsorship scheme with Cabair and a mentor airline pilot scheme with Flight Training Europe,? says Cheese. With 
the Cabair scheme, Flybe funds ?20,000 of the ?55,000 course costs. Six students a year are sponsored this way 
and in the first two years all have been taken on by Flybe. The mentored pilots receive about ?7,000, and some 
extra training is paid for by Flybe once they have completed the course.
Such programmes give the airline better control, he believes. ?These schemes ensure that we achieve quality 
control from a very early stage as we are part of the selection process from the outset.? In addition, non-sponsored 
students are also being recruited directly after finishing their courses. ?We draw both Integrated and ?One Stop? 
Modular students from five UK flight training organisations on recommendation,? said Cheese, who is also prepared 
to look further afield and hire non-UK pilots. ?We hire pilots with a JAA licence and the right to live and work in the 
UK.?
One problem for carriers with large turboprop fleets is retaining aircrew. Given the thirst for pilots among large 
carriers and rival jet-based low-fares airlines, it is inevitable that some of Flybe? pilots are lured elsewhere. Cheese 
is philosophical: ?I would not use the term ?poaching?. Pilots aspire to different things and there will always be a 
group that wish to fly different aeroplanes, work closer to home or overseas, or fly in a different environment. That 
has always been the way in aviation.?
To counter pilots leaving, Cheese says Flybe can offer a fast track to a captain? job. ?A commander? salary here 
will exceed a first officer? pay on a 757,? he says. Some pilots have progressed within around three years. ?We 
have some very young captains, including one 24-year-old who wasn? old enough to hire a car.?
The long-haul airline
The current spike in demand for air travel has seen passenger traffic in the first four months of 2006 running 7% up 
on last year, while airliner manufacturers are reporting record deliveries. Among the biggest winners from this 
market boom are the large Middle Eastern carriers, with more than half the widebodied aircraft to be delivered over 
the next 16 years estimated as going to airlines in the region.
Rick Helliwell, vice-president of recruitment for one of the fastest-growing airlines in the region, Emirates, has a job 
on his hands managing the company? need for staff. He is looking to recruit 300 aircrew this year alone, mainly to 
service growth; Emirates is adding 14 widebodied jets to its fleet this year alone.
And as Emirates? policy is only to recruit experienced aircrew, he has to rely on the reputation of the airline, plus 
the appeal of the Dubai lifestyle, to get the best candidates. ?We get a steady flow of applications ? pilots can 
register their interest in working for Emirates online. But a lot of applicants don? have sufficient experience. We look 
for 4,000h, including 2,000h on multi-engine jets.?
Heavy demand.
Applicants who fulfil that requirement have to undergo a thorough interview process, including flight simulators and 
psychometric testing. Only about half of those interviewed make the grade, says Helliwell, but because those hired 
already have plenty of hours, the route from first officer to captain is quick ? three to four years.
Whereas Emirates was able to hang on to its aircrew in the immediate post-9/11 period, Helliwell has noticed an 
increased turnover in aircrew recently as demand has picked up in other regions. ?China needs thousands of pilots 
over the next few years, and there could be a pilot shortage soon in the USA,? he says. ?It? getting more 
challenging to attract the right people.? Emirates casts its net far afield when it hires pilots, including as far away as 
South America and Australasia ? Helliwell himself is a New Zealander.
Emirates? thirst for new recruits is not just confined to aircrew. The airline has opted not to outsource MRO, and is 
building a massive new maintenance hangar in Dubai to service its A380 fleet. ?We?re also hiring engineers and 
mechanics from all over the world,? says Helliwell. ?We need to cope with the growing numbers of aircraft, plus the 
extra areas of specialisation on the aircraft ? for example we need specialists to maintain our in-flight entertainment 
systems alone.?
Emirates Group has become a diverse organisation, managing all ground handling at Dubai airport in addition to its 
large air cargo and IT divisions. ?In total we?re recruiting 4,000-5,000 people across the whole organisation this 
year.? Many of these are cabin crew, with Emirates now hiring between 60 and 80 new cabin staff each week. ?We 
have a need for more than 10,000 new cabin staff in the next five years,? says Helliwell.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Monday it has bought 10 more Boeing 737-800s, the no-frills airline's jet of choice as it 
expands across Europe, valued at approximately US$700 million (â¬550 million).
In a statement, Ryanair said the order means the airline has bought 142 Boeing 737-800s for delivery by 2012. The 
10 newly ordered planes are expected to begin service in March, April and June next year.
The Dublin-based airline already operates 107 Boeing 737-800s as part of a mammoth deal with Boeing that gives 
the budget carrier the option to buy several hundred of the aircraft at pre-set, bulk-rate prices, although neither side 
has disclosed details of the price agreement.
Ryanair said its agreement with Boeing means it has voidable options to buy up to 169 more aircraft for delivery by 
2014. It credits the Boeing 737-800, which has an average seating capacity of 160, with being more cost-effective 
and fuel-efficient than passenger jets manufactured by rival Airbus.
"The outstanding reliability and lowest operating costs of Boeing's 737-800 aircraft lie at the heart of Ryanair's 
ability to deliver the lowest fares and best punctuality to our passengers," said Howard Millar, Ryanair's chief 
financial officer.

Boeing Co. said Monday that European low-cost carrier Ryanair has exercised options to order 10 more of its next-
generation 737-800 jets.
The order is valued at $705 million at list prices, though carriers often can negotiate discounts. Deliveries will begin 
in 2008. The planes will be outfitted with winglets, which reduce drag to boost fuel efficiency by 3 to 5 percent.
Airlines recently have been ordering more jets, hoping to retire the older, gas-guzzling portions of their fleet amid 
high fuel prices. Boeing has been battling with European rival Airbus to fill the market.
Ryanair is the world's second-largest operator of the 737 jet, after Southwest Airlines Co.
Boeing shares fell 62 cents to $81.29 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

No- frills airline Ryanair has welcomed a High Court ruling overturning the decision by the Commission for Aviation 
Regulation (CAR) to impose full slot coordination at Dublin Airport.
The High Court found that the CAR failed to follow the required steps proscribed by the European Regulation on 
slot coordination. 
The Regulation states that full coordination of airports should be the last resort and should only be done if it can be 
demonstrated that there is a serious capacity problem that cannot be resolved in the short term. 
 CAR failed to have an expert carry out a thorough capacity analysis and must consult with the airport and airport

AUSTRALIAN WALKABOUT
AUSTRALIAN WALKABOUT

Section: FEATURES
Length: 983 words
Highlight: Awas may now be British, but Australian operating leasing is booming. The three lessors are also in it for 
the long term.
Body
According to the stereotype, Australian men love sport, beer and barbecuing. Whether this is fair is up for debate, 
but all anyone in aviation finance needs to know is that Australians are usually well insured with private pensions. 
Firms such as Allco, Babcock & Brown and Macquarie are not new to aviation finance, but in the past few years 
they have become increasingly important as principals rather than arrangers. 
So far - with the exception on Babcock & Brown - most of their investments have been fairly low key. Allco has 
quietly grown a portfolio of about 32 aircraft through individual aircraft deals. Macquarie has been looking for aircraft 
and has also launched a successful spare engine leasing business. 
Retiring people 
One of the reasons that Australian firms are investing in operating leasing goes back to the 1980s. At that time 
about 40% of Australians had a private pension and the government was worried about the country's ageing 
population. Compulsory private pensions became law in 1992 and the required contribution rate has risen from 3% 
of salary to 9%. There are also tax incentives for people who contribute more. 
Australians also take insurance seriously. Although the Australian economy has performed well, it is still relatively 
small, forcing fund managers to look abroad. Many have been happy with returns from infrastructure and general 
asset finance funds and are now looking at aircraft. 
Babcock & Brown - first-mover advantage 
Babcock & Brown is not a new entrant to the aircraft leasing business. The Australian firm created Babcock & 
Brown Aircraft Management (BBAM) in 1991 to manage operating lease deals that it had structured through its 
Nomura Babcock & Brown joint venture. It also managed aircraft for other investors and made its first principal 
investments soon after. 
AUSTRALIAN WALKABOUT
BBAM has grown its portfolio by almost 25% in the past 12 months to $4 billion. Most of these aircraft were added 
using a $1.2 billion facility that the lessor closed with CSFB in 2006. The facility was later expanded and the 
arranger is planning a similar-sized second deal for the end of this year. 
One market in which BBAM is expanding fast is cargo. The lessor is converting a number of its 757-200s to 
manage residual values. BBAM is using two different conversion companies - Alcoa-SIE Cargo and Precision 
Conversions. 
Allco - Asian widebodies 
A lot is going on at Allco. The Australian investment company is merging with Record Investments, a listed 
investment fund that it manages. By merging, Allco is effectively floating itself. 
Allco has acquired 34 aircraft in the past three years and is planning to add another eight by the end of this year. 
The company's main focus is on organic growth. 
Allco's first deals were for Jetstar and Qantas, but the lessor quickly looked abroad closing deals for Asiana, British 
Airways, EVA Air, Ryanair, SIA Cargo and Emirates. Qantas, however, still accounts for about half its portfolio. 
That portfolio has a large number of narrowbodies but one of the ways the lessor has stood out is in its willingness 
to acquire widebody aircraft. "Allco has dominated the Asia widebody market," says one rival lessor. "They are 
smart people doing a great job." 
The bank is also prepared to put equity into more structured deals. In 2005 it closed an innovative export credit-
guaranteed operating lease for Asiana. Allco also took the junior and mezzanine tranches in qualifying debt 
securities operating lease financing for a SIA Cargo 747-400F aircraft. 
Although the aircraft division has fewer than 10 people - this is expected to increase when aircraft leases get closer 
to maturity - it is a significant part of Allco's asset finance and leasing business (which accounts for 60% of the 
firm's profits). Allco also has two directors - David Turnbull, the former CEO of Cathay Pacific, and Rod Eddington, 
the former CEO of British Airways - who understand the market. 
The 777-300ER that Boeing is displaying at the Farnborough Airshow this year belongs to Allco and is on a delivery 
flight to EVA Air. 
Macquarie - engines and aircraft 
Macquarie Bank is well known for its airport fund but is also active in aircraft and engine leasing. 
Macquarie Engine Capital is the most public. The spare engine lessor has been in the market for about three years 
and has quietly grown a portfolio of between 15 and 20 engines (it does not release exact figures). The leasing 
company is on the bank's balance sheet with Macquarie investing equity and debt, although it also syndicates debt 
on some deals. 
The lessor's growth has been restricted by the lack of spare engines in the market. "We chose to enter the market 
because we believe in the asset," says Andrew Pearce, a director at Macquarie. "Macquarie is in this market for the 
long term and we will keep growing." 
Macquarie is also keen to grow its aircraft leasing business. This was most obvious when it bid for Awas. The bank 
is trying to grow organically and has acquired a small portfolio of A320s and 737-800s through sale/leasebacks with 
Qantas. It is also looking to hire aircraft leasing specialists. 
Some bankers believe that Macquarie's plan may be to float a listed aircraft fund similar to the ones it has launched 
for other asset classes, such as airports. 
Big plans 
AUSTRALIAN WALKABOUT
Although it makes life easier to group institutions together, the three Australian operating lessors are at very 
different stages and have very different strategies. BBAM is a large established lessor with offices in San Francisco, 
Dublin, London and Dubai. 
Allco is in a fast growth stage. The size of its portfolio is impressive and it would be no surprise to see it reach 100 
aircraft in the next few years. 
Macquarie has not grown as fast but is definitely one to watch. 
Another stereotype that sellers should remember is that all Australians like a bargain - and this is certainly true with 
Australian lessors.

The firm, which is a spin-off from Elan, is already listed on the Nasdaq index in the US.
The firm hopes that by listing here it will raise its profile in Europe and attract further investor support on this side of 
the Atlantic.
 The company said yesterday that it has achieved target patient enrolment in the North American Phase III clinical 
trial of its Huntington's disease (HD) treatment Miraxion. Amarin was founded by former Elan finance director Tom 
Lynch and also includes Ryanair-founder Tony Ryan on its share register. The company is also developing drugs 
for Parkinson's disease and depressive disorders.

Body
Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest airline in the US, is reported to be looking at launching a number of routes 
from the US to both Dublin and Shannon.
The move will come as a blow to Aer Lingus' expansion plans in the transatlantic market, according to the Irish 
Independent.
While consumers will welcome the extra competition, Aer Lingus will not be so happy as it derives much of its 
revenue from transatlantic routes.
 The Irish airline has pinned much of its expansion plans on the market and is currently awaiting the completion of 
the Open Skies agreement to launch new routes. The move by the US airline, which enjoys Chapter 11 protection 
from bankruptcy, comes at a bad time for Aer Lingus as it faces increased competition from Ryanair on the majority 
of its short-haul routes and awaits government clearance to float on the stock exchange. As well as being the fourth 
largest carrier in the US, Northwest lays claim to being the fifth largest carrier in the world. Northwest already has 
hubs at Amsterdam, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St Paul and Tokyo, but continues to rack up huge losses. Last 
month it reported a USD1.1bn loss for Q1, 2006, up from USD529m in the same period last year. The Minneapolis-
based airline is looking to Europe to offset domestic losses.

Your articles ? ?Time to change? Pilots at Europe?s fast-growing low-cost carriers are flying more and facing 
different pressures? and ?EasyJet seeks better roster? (Flight International, 6-13 June) ? created a misleading 
impression that EasyJet has solved its scheduling and fatigue management issues by introducing a five-two-five-
four roster pattern. For example, you quote a survey that shows ?93% of pilots stated they felt less fatigued under 
the new roster?. This survey was conducted 18 months ago by the British Air Line Pilots? Association (BALPA) 
during the initial trial period and covered pilots based in Luton and Edinburgh.
A more recent survey of all EasyJet pilots conducted in January showed that 86% of pilots are unhappy with the 
existing roster pattern. As with any trial, short-term benefits have to be measured against the longer-term impact 
and sustainability of any new way of working. Discussions are taking place between EasyJet and BALPA to address 
ongoing fatigue and work-life balance issues.
You also say the UK Civil Aviation Authority has given EasyJet ?a permanent alleviation to work outside flight time 
limits [by adopting the five-two-five-four pattern] at all 14 company bases?. To the best of our knowledge this is not 
true. The CAA has granted a further 12-month trial period for five-two-five-four, not a permanent alleviation.
BALPA does recognise improvements to scheduling and fatigue management EasyJet has pioneered that allow 
pilots to raise flight-safety concerns and develop effective solutions with the company. Can the same be said of the 
?zero-tolerance approach? in Ryanair?

Body
Financial stocks helped the Dublin market regain Friday's losses today, with analysts predicting that the market 
could be about to come back to life in the days ahead after a volatile few weeks.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares closed up 
A slow start on Wall Street kept gains in Dublin in check as wary US investors marked time ahead of the Federal 
Reserve rates decision on Thursday.
 The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to lift rates by 25 basis points, bringing the official cash rate to 5.25pc. 
However, a 50 basis point hike has been muted in some quarters. In Dublin, the financial sector turned in a positive 
performance. Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life and Permanent led the way with gains of 37c to 1127 and 40c to 1860 
respectively. Elsewhere in the sector, AIB climbed 3c to 1818 and Bank of Ireland was up 20c to 1381. Construction 
stocks went in the other direction. Shares in Grafton fell 3c to 955, McInerney fell 33c to 1092, while CRH was 
unchanged at 2490. Kingspan stocks also suffered after it announced it has acquired Leanfort Limited, a holding 
company for Hytherma and Xtratherm, in a deal which could be worth E87m. Xtratherm is a polyisocyanurate rigid 
board manufacturer in the UK and Irish markets, operating from Chesterfield in Britain and Navan, Co. Meath. 
Shares in Kingspan fell 23c to 1307. Shares in Kerry Group shot up after the food company announced it has 
started buying back up to 2.8 million shares representing around 1.5pc of its share capital. In line with stock market 
rules, Kerry says the maximum price payable will be limited to no more than 105pc of the average daily price at 
which shares are dealt on each of the five dealing days preceding the date of purchase. The group said that the 
shares it buys back will be held as treasury shares, until they are reissued under Kerry's employee share option 
scheme. Kerry tacked on 71c to 1701. Elan also made decent headway, adding on 45c to 1365. Shares in no- frills 
airline Ryanair did not fare so well however, shedding 9c to 705. Independent News and Media were in negative 
territory despite announcing that it expects first half revenue growth to be ahead year on year by 3pc. The company 
said group circulation revenues are expected to also rise by 3pc while advertising revenues gain 3.5pc and adjusted 
Financial stocks push ISEQ higher
earnings per share will jump 10pc higher than the same period last year. Shares slipped 5c to 225. Elsewhere 
bookmaker Paddy Power was up 9c to 1309 as punters continue to flutter on the summers big sporting events. With 
the World Cup now entering the closing rounds and the Wimbledon tennis championships underway in London, the 
bookies are experiencing a busy time. Dublin security and computer systems firm Norkom, which was launched on 
the Dublin market today, remained unchanged at 127.

EU clears French subsidy for Ryanair to start Toulon-London route

EU regulators cleared a French subsidy to low-fare airline Ryanair Holdings PLC on Friday to help it start flying from 
Toulon to London Stansted just weeks after the company complained about government funds paid to rival Air 
France-KLM.
The owner of Toulon Hyeres airport, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Var, can go ahead and pay 50 
percent of the Irish airline's "additional costs" up to a â¬500,000 (US$629,000) threshold per year for three years, the 
European Commission said. The aid may also be extended for an extra two years.
Ryanair has expanded rapidly with its "no-frills" low-fare flights undercutting rivals. It usually flies to smaller regional 
airports that often offer low charges or subsidize its costs to attract new business.
Regulators said they approved the grant because it met EU guidelines designed to stop government money giving a 
company an unfair advantage over rivals. It said the French funds would help develop year-round tourism in the 
region.
Ryanair's rollout of new routes in France has led to a spat with France's flagship airline that has seen it file two 
antitrust complaints against Air France.
Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenue, has also complained about lower airport fees offered to 
Ryanair by Marseilles airport to help it serve 13 routes and bring in up to 1 million extra passengers. It said it has 
appealed to the Council of State, France's highest administrative body, against discriminatory fees.
Ryanair said the French Civil Aviation Authority had cleared the fees, describing the complaint as "the latest in a 
long line of abuses by Air France to protect their stranglehold on the French market."
It filed a complaint to the European Commission last month regarding approximately â¬1 billion (US$1.26 billion) 
worth of state aid it alleged Air France has received in the form of subsidized domestic landing and passenger fees.
Ryanair is still fighting an EU ruling that ordered it to pay back a â¬4.5 million (US$5.66 million) Belgian subsidy to 
run flights out of Charleroi airport.
EU clears French subsidy for Ryanair to start Toulon-London route
In February 2004, EU regulators ruled parts of Ryanair's contract with Charleroi were illegal and ordered the airline 
to make changes. Charleroi was granting the airline up to 90 percent of its costs over 15 years.
Ryanair is currently appealing the ruling at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.

The flights will operate from Toulon Hyeres and London Stansted.

Britain's Office of Fair Trading and the U.S. Department of Justice are investigating alleged cartel activity involving 
British Airways and other airlines in relation to pricing of passenger air transportation, including fuel surcharges, BA 
said Thursday.
In a brief statement, BA said it was assisting the Office of Fair Trading and the Department of Justice with their 
investigations, but it provided no other details about the probe or the other airlines involved.
BA said Martin George, its commercial director, and Iain Burns, its head of communications, have been given 
leaves of absence during the probe.
A spokeswoman at the Office of Fair Trading confirmed the investigation into alleged cartel pricing by British 
Airways. "It's very recent," an OFT spokeswoman said, declining to provide any other details. She spoke on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with government policy.
Paul Charles, director of communications at Virgin Atlantic, said: "We're aware of the investigations, and we're 
assisting with inquiries" from the two agencies. In a telephone interview, he declined to say whether Virgin Atlantic 
was being investigated.
Charles said Virgin Atlantic had not placed any of its staff members on leaves of absence.
British Airways shares were down 3.5 percent to 354.75 pence (â¬5.18, US$6.54) on the London Stock Exchange 
following the announcement.
Two other airlines, Ryanair and Lufthansa said they were not being investigated.
United Airlines declined to immediately comment, saying it was preparing a statement.

British and U.S. authorities are investigating alleged price-fixing in passenger fares and fuel surcharges by British 
Airways PLC and other airlines, the carrier said Thursday, and two senior executives have been placed on leave.
BA said it was assisting the Office of Fair Trading and the U.S. Department of Justice, but it provided no other 
details. Other airlines including Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American Airlines said they were cooperating 
with the probe.
Two BA executives commercial director Martin George and head of communications Iain Burns have been given 
leaves of absence. BA declined to provide any information beyond its brief statement, including whether George 
and Burns were asked to leave or ordered out.
High fuel prices have led airlines to raise the surcharge that passengers pay on long-haul flights. For instance, BA 
customers now pay a 70 pound ($129) surcharge on a round-trip ticket from London to New York, the airline said.
The OFT said it was conducting "both a criminal and civil investigation into alleged price coordination by airlines in 
relation to fuel surcharges for long-haul passenger flights to and from the U.K." OFT said its officials visited BA 
offices on June 13. The Justice Department did not return a call seeking comment.
The probe is in its early stages, the OFT said, and "no assumption should be made that there has been an 
infringement of competition law" until the investigation is complete.
The agency said it has named only British Airways at this point because it's the only airline that issued a statement 
saying it was a target of the probe.
BA shares tumbled 5.9 percent to close at 346 pence ($6.38) on the London Stock Exchange.
Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Charles said the airline was aware of the investigations and was "assisting with 
inquiries" from the two agencies. Charles declined to say whether the carrier was being investigated but said none 
of its staff had been placed on leave.
BA investigated by Britain, U.S. for alleged cartel activity
AMR Corp.'s American Airlines said it "has received a United States federal grand jury subpoena in connection with 
a government investigation into alleged price fixing in the air passenger industry. The airline has been informed that 
the company is not a target of the investigation."
Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, said: "We've been informed by the Department of 
Justice that United is not a target of their investigation, and we are cooperating with them in full."
Other airlines Delta Air Lines Inc., Ryanair Holdings PLC, bmi, Continental Airlines Inc., Lufthansa, Finnair, KLM, 
Icelandair and SAS said they were not being investigated.
In February, more than a dozen airlines were drawn into an investigation by U.S. and European Union officials of 
suspected collusion in the air cargo industry to fix prices on surcharges for fuel, security and insurance.
European and U.S. officials refused to provide details about the probe. But one of the airlines targeted, SAS AB's 
SAS Cargo in Copenhagen, Denmark, said the EU alleged that cooperation among airlines began in 2000 and 
involved agreements about surcharges imposed by airlines to offset certain external costs.
SAS said the costs included surcharges on fuel, added security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and premiums for 
war-risk insurance after the start of the war in Iraq.
Raids were conducted then at the offices of several airlines, including BA, and several cargo carriers said they had 
been contacted by authorities or issued subpoenas.
BA confirmed at the time that it had received a request for information from the European Commission and the U.S. 
Department of Justice "relating to alleged cartel activity involving BA and a number of other airlines and cargo 
operators."

Body
Southwest Airlines is to experiment with assigning seats to passengers for the first time in an attempt to boost 
efficiency and enhance its appeal.
Southwest is the largest US domestic airline and provided the business model for the huge growth of low-cost 
operators such as Easyjet and Ryanair, which also use a first-come, first-served method to board passengers.
However, the restructuring of the US airline industry has narrowed Southwest's cost advantage over rivals, almost 
all of which provide assigned seats at a time when reduced capacity has led to fuller aircraft.
Southwest will start allocating seats on some flights from San Diego next month, but stressed that "this evaluation is 
an important step to determine the feasibility of assigned seating . . . but only a test".
The airline, like most of its low-cost rivals, boards aircraft in four groups determined by when a passenger checks 
in. The initial tests will be done manually, avoiding any expensive changes to its reservations system, and analysts 
said the key test would be any impact on its ability to turn round aircraft at airports in its target time of 20 minutes.
The fast turnround times have been emulated by much of the industry seeking to match Southwest's efficiency 
levels, which has allowed it to maintain profitability in spite of offering some of the highest paylevels in the sector.
Southwest's move is the latest tweak to its business model. Changes to its reservation system could allow it to 
launch international flights for the first time.

Body
The Dublin market continued to lose ground in early trading today after its run of four consecutive days of gains 
came to an end yesterday.
By midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 73.89 at 7289.22.
Shares fell by 54 points yesterday following a hint from the US Federal Reserve of a further rate hike.
 The construction sector was hit hardest in early exchanges after the worlds largest plumbing and heating products 
distributor, Wolseley, announced this morning that it has spent Â£900m on acquisitions in the current financial year 
and expects them to add Â£1.4 bn to annual revenue. Wolseley is one of the top three in the UK merchanting market, 
with Grafton number four. Shares in Grafton fell 4c to 960 in morning trading. Elsewhere in the sector, CRH fell by 
43c to 2478, Kingspan fell 8c to 1290, while McInerney was unchanged at 1140. Meanwhile, Financial stocks 
continued to come under pressure this morning with shares in AIB down 17c to 1811, Anglo Irish Bank down 10c to 
1104 and Bank of Ireland 18c lower at 1382. Irish Lifer and Permanent was unchanged at 1800. Elan was another 
faller, dropping 8c to 1280, while bookmaker Paddy Power remained unchanged at 1295. Shares in Ryanair fell 
after the no-frills airline today said it has entered into a deal with Equity Insurance Group to provide its UK 
customers with car and home insurance products. The company confirmed this morning that from today, its UK 
customers will have access to car and home insurance with Equity via the airline's website. Shares in the company 
were 13c lower at 7.07.

Highlight: The Dublin market closed lower today in line with volatile trading in London and New York.
Body
The Dublin market closed lower today in line with volatile trading on the London and New York markets following a 
hint from the US Federal Reserve of a further rate hike.
The ISEQ closed down 54.03 at 7363.11.
Leading Irish stocks were also hit by profit taking as investors pocketed profits following four consecutive days of 
gains.
 Investors in the US are eagerly waiting to see whether the Fed will raise rates again at its two-day meeting June 
28-29. Data today showed inflation in terms of input prices for US firms is rising and world markets are anxiously 
awaiting more signals later this week on just how quickly US inflation is rising. Adverse figures will make it a virtual 
certainty that the Fed will hike rates next month to 5.25pc and uncertainty will creep in again of another rate rise in 
August. Many analysts say that a 5.5pc base rate in the US could trigger a sharp slowdown in growth as money 
becomes more expensive. In Dublin, Elan was the main faller of the day, shedding just over 3pc, as investors 
plundered profits from the pharmaceutical firm after it soared in recent days following a stockbroker upgrade. 
Shares in the company closed 40c lower at 1289. The financials were also hit hard today. AIB fell 31c to 1808, 
while Bank of Ireland dropped 29 to 1400, Anglo Irish Bank dropped 6c to 1114 and Irish Life and Permanent 
slipped 34c to close on 1795. Construction stocks also had a bad day at the office. Building materials group CRH 
shed some of the gains it made on Monday on news of a probable giant takeover in the US. Shares in the group 
closed 5c lower on 2524. Elsewhere in the sector, Grafton was down 5c to 965, Kingspan was off by 19c to 1295 
and McInerney dropped 9c to 1140. DCC was one of few stocks which made any real headway today after the 
business support firm announced to the stock exchange that it had bought back 1.29pc of its own shares, worth 
E18.8m. The company said in a regulatory note to the exchange that it repurchased the shares on Monday at a 
price of E17.90 each. Shares in the company were up 10c to 1800. Ryanair announced today that its website 
recorded its busiest day ever on Monday as customers logged on to their one euro July seat sale. The site 
ISEQ down in line with world markets
registered a record 6.5 million page views that resulted in the airline taking 198,000 bookings in a single day. 
Shares in the company were unchanged at 712.

Body
Michael O'Leary, the outspoken chief executive of Ryanair, who is famously tough on his competitors, has admitted 
to a few of his own shortcomings in an interview with The Times today.
O'Leary, who has said that he plans to retire in 2008, told The Times that Ryanair would need someone "more 
professional" than him when it became Europe's biggest carrier.
"When we're the biggest airline in Europe, it will be inappropriate to have somebody here shouting, swearing, 
abusing the competition," he said.
 "You need more professional management than me. And that time is coming," O'Leary is reported as saying. 
Asked whether an Irishman might succeed him at the helm of Ireland's phenomenally successful company, he said, 
perhaps with tongue firmly in cheek: "Much more likely a ghastly, emollient Englishman, probably with a knighthood: 
Sir Roger Mucknsmuck." O'Leary is famed for his outspoken comments and raucous abuse of passengers who 
delay his aircraft or complain about flight service standards. Earlier this month, Ryanair, Europes biggest low-cost 
operator, said that it was on track to double passenger volumes and profit by 2012.

No- frills airline, Ryanair recorded its busiest day ever yesterday as customers logged on to their E1 July seat sale. 
The internet site registered a record 6.5 million page views that resulted in the airline taking 198,000 bookings in a

Peter Sherrard Ryanair's Head of Communications said, "Yesterday the www.ryanair.com servers were going into 
overdrive to cope with an unprecedented volume of bookings following the announcement of our E1 seat sale. We 
are used to our seat sales generating big increases in traffic but because this sale includes flights for E1 during the 
popular first half of July, traffic volumes broke all previous records. The record 198,000 bookings is a 16pc increase 
on the previous record set in September 2005.

Body
Ryanair has written to the European Commission about what it claims is the latest abuse of state subsidy rules in 
Italy. 
A statement from the low fares ariline says it "contacted the Commission following the announcement that Alitalia 
would be allowed to fly on a public service obligation (PSO) route that it did not even apply for in the first place".
In a statement today, Ryanair says: "When the Italian Civil Aviation Authority blocked Ryanair and Easyjet from 
offering low fares, competition and choice to consumers between mainland Italy and Sardinia in May, the European 
Commission launched an investigation into the application of PSO rules in Italy. 
 "The PSO rules are being abused by the Italian authorities to protect high fare Italian airlines and block low fares 
and competition. Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said: "We are calling on the European 
Commission to reach a speedy conclusion to its investigation. "Italian consumers are being forced to pay fares four 
times higher than last year to fly between mainland Italy and Sardinia because the Italian authorities have 
systematically abused the PSO rules to protect high fare Italian airlines and block low fares and competition. 
"Following the announcement that Alitalia will be allowed to fly on a PSO route between mainland Italy and Sardinia 
that it did not even apply for, Ryanair is asking the Commission to investigate the latest abuses. "We are calling on 
the Commission to take immediate action to end these abuses and allow competition and low fares on the 
Sardinian routes".

EasyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has just got a a knighthood but rival Ryanair deserves something for its 
services to minicabs around Stansted airport.
Their business is booming because flights often arrive after the last Stansted Express leaves for London.
One minicab driver said: "Our whole business would collapse if Ryanair flights were on time."
According to the airline's website, 13 per cent of flights were late in May, up from 9 per cent last year.
It blamed the increase in lateness on construction at Dublin airport. Even if only 9 per cent of flights were late, that 
could mean as many as 320,000 passengers looking for a way home.

The Dublin market showed further promise this morning that last weeks heavy declines are behind it, as it followed 
world markets higher.
By 1115 the ISEQ index of Irish shares was 53.50 points higher at 7364.03.
After heavy falls last week, the ISEQ bounced back yesterday with gains of almost 300c. After dropping below the 
7000 level on Monday for the first time in six months, the market was trading in positive territory this morning for the 
third consecutive day.
 World markets received a boost after Wall Street posted its highest gains in over a year last night. Leading London 
shares got off to a strong start in early deals and Asian indices also enjoyed substantial gains this morning. In 
Dublin, the financials continued to perform strongly. AIB was up 14c to 18.2927, while Anglo Irish Bank climbed 20c 
to 11.47. Bank of Ireland was also trading well, up 8c to 14.08, while Irish Life and Permanent gained 50c to 18.45. 
Leading construction stocks also made moderate gains in early deals, with CRH climbing 1c to 24.51, Grafton up 
10c to 9.85 and Kingspan gained 9c to 12.90. McInerney was unchanged at 11.15. C and C was boosted by news 
that private equity group, BC Partners, has sold 15.5 million shares in the snacks and drinks group, representing 
5pc of the firm's total equity. BC has been reducing its holding in C and C after it floated on the stock market two 
years ago. Yesterday's block of shares is thought to have been placed at E6.52, just below where C and C traded 
for most of the day. This price signals strong demand for the stock, with placings more usually completed at a more 
significant discount to trading levels and comes following a glowing stockbrokers report on the firm's hugely popular 
Magners cider launch and expansion in the UK. Shares in C and C were 10c higher on 6.72. Elsewhere on the 
market this morning, Elan was up 20c to 13.10, Independent News and Media climbed 3c to 2.32, Kerry climbed 
25c to 16.25 and Paddy Power gained 30c to 12.80. Ryanair dropped 2c to 11.14.

The Dublin market continued to bounce back this morning as shares traded in positive territory for the second 
consecutive day.
By 1100am the ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 171.79 to 7185.06.
Tuesday saw leading Irish shares drop a whopping 238 points adding to a week of misery for the Dublin market 
when more than E5 billion was wiped off the value of Irish with banking and construction stocks hit particularly hard.
 The market was able to put an end to its losing streak yesterday with shares closing almost 60 points higher. It was 
the same story in early trading today as last weeks big fallers in the construction and banking sectors managed to 
make some headway. AIB climbed 63c to 1788, while Bank of Ireland gained 49c to 1380. Elsewhere in the sector, 
Anglo Irish Bank gained 25c to trade at 1099 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 39 to 1764. Construction stocks 
also opened strongly. Shares in CRH clawed back 60c to 2390, while Kingspan gained 11c to 1255 and Grafton 
traded 35c higher at 970. McInerney was unchanged at 1112. Elsewhere, Paddy Power made modest gains as 
punters continue to have a flutter on the World Cup. Stocks in the Irish bookmaker were up 25 to 1225. Shares in 
Ryanair also climbed, gaining 18c to trade at 723, while the Kerry Group, added 27c to 1600. Elan gained 45c to

Shares on the Dublin exchange bounced back yesterday by almost 300 points as the market ended in positive 
territory for the second consecutive day.
The market was able to put an end to its losing streak on Wednesday with shares closing almost 60 points higher. 
That came after a hard week for the ISEQ in which more than E5bn was wiped off the value of Irish shares.
Last week's big fallers continued to make strong headway yesterday, particularly those in the financial and 
construction sectors.
 Shares in AIB shot up by 90c to close at 1815, while Bank of Ireland also made solid gains, climbing 57c to 1388. 
Elsewhere in the sector Anglo Irish Bank gained 30c to 1104 and Irish Life and Permanent added on 33c to close 
on 1758. Impressive gains were also made by leading construction stocks. CRH led the way climbing 106c to 2436, 
McInerney gained 3c to 1115 and Grafton added on 45c to close on 980. Building materials group also saw its 
share price climb after stockbrokers at Goodbody forecast that its Off-site and Structural business will generate 
17pc of group revenues in the current year. Shares in Kingspan closed 36c higher at 1280. Food group C and C 
was boosted by news of a strong UK performance by Magners. A survey of 1,108 pubs across Britain by Merrion 
Ireland showed that Magners was being sold in 42.5pc of all establishments. Merrion said that this implied "a very 
successful distribution build across a broad geographical area". The survey also showed that 12pc of the pubs had 
only started to stock Magners within the last four weeks. Merrion said this gave it confidence that "distribution will 
continue to grow from already high levels". Shares in C and C closed 10c higher at 662. Meanwhile, Elan turned in 
a positive performance after stockbrokers at Davy upgraded their forecasts for Elan in light of the US price increase 
for Multiple Sclerosis drug Tysabri. Drugs developer, Elan, announced its pricing plan for Tysabri last week, raising 
the wholesale cost of the drug to USD2,184.62 per vial, up 21pc on its original launch price. Davy forecast that 
global Tysabri revenues could reach USD2bn by 2010, based on patient penetration of approximately 80,000.

The Dublin market made cautious gains this morning as the ISEQ index of Irish shares climbed back above the 
7000 level this morning after shedding over 200 points yesterday.
By midday, the ISEQ was up 65.04c at 6504.
Yesterday saw leading Irish shares drop a whopping 238 points, meaning that more than E5bn has been wiped off 
the value of Irish stocks within the last week with banking and construction stocks hit particularly hard.
 Leading financial stocks were able to steady the ship somewhat in early trading today however, with AIB climbing 
43c to 1718, while Bank of Ireland gained 15c to 1325. Elsewhere in the sector, Anglo Irish Bank gained 20c to 
trade at 1100, but Irish Life and Permanent was down again, dropping a further 4c to 1726 after shedding 40c 
yesterday. The construction sector also fared better in trading today. Shares in CRH clawed back 15c to 2305, CRH 
was boosted after Euroconstruct increased its forecasts for 2006. Stockbrokers at Davy predicted that on the basis 
of Euroconstruct's latest numbers, CRH should experience above-average growth this year and in 2007. "Weighted 
by revenue, we estimate that the company's European markets should deliver top-line organic growth of 3.4pc in 
2006, up from 1.8pc based on Euroconstruct's December forecasts. Growth in 2007 should be 1.9pc, compared 
with 1.3pc based on December's forecasts," Davy analyst Barry Nixon said. Kingspan gained 15c to 1230, while 
McInerney was unchanged on 1120. Grafton was unable to turn the corner however, trading 7c lower at 933. 
Eircom made slight gains in early deals after it was confirmed this morning that it would convene an EGM on July 
26 where shareholders can vote on Babcock and Brown/ESOT's joint offer for the company. Shares in the Irish 
telco climbed 1c to 217. Elsewhere, Paddy Power dropped 15c as the World Cup betting frenzy continued. 
Bookmakers have taken a hit in the opening games as the favourites continue to win. Ryanair stocks were another 
climber, gaining 20c to trade at 715, as was the Kerry Group, which added to 15c to 1585.

Cut-rate fares leader Ryanair takes on Air France in ongoing spat

Body
Ryanair, a European leader in cut-rate airfares, lambasted Air France on Tuesday for allegedly trying to block 
competition after the French national carrier protested lower airport fees it claimed were offered to its Irish 
competitor in Marseille.
Air France said it had appealed last week to the Council of State, France's highest administrative body, against 
lower fees offered to Ryanair at the airport in southern France.
An Air France spokeswoman said that Ryanair was being offered lower per-passengers fees than the French carrier 
pays.
"It is discriminatory," she said, asking not to be cited by name in accordance with Air France policy. She said she 
did not know when the council might rule.
Ryanair replied with a further complaint to the European Commission based on an "abuse of dominance under the 
European competition rules," the company said.
The airline announced last month that it would base two new aircraft at Marseille Airport, to serve 13 routes and 
reportedly deliver almost 1 million additional passengers annually to the airport.
A Ryanair statement said the tariff for using the Marseille airport was published and agreed to by the French Civil 
Aviation Authority.
"This is the latest in a long line of abuses by Air France to protect their strangle-hold on the French market," said 
Jim Callaghan, Ryanair's regulatory affairs chief.
Ryanair filed a complaint to the European Commission last month regarding approximately â¬1 billion (US$1.26 
billion) worth of state aid it alleged Air France has received in the form of subsidized domestic landing and 
passenger fees.

The Dublin market shed over 200 points today, falling below the 7000 level for the first time in over 6-months as 
investors continue to fret over inflation and interest rates.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down by 3.3pc or 238.10 to close on 6997.12.
Irish shares fell in tandem with markets around the world, with sharp falls recorded across all sectors, including 
banking, construction and food stocks.
 London's FTSE closed 1.8pc lower at 5,520 this evening, while the Paris CAC and the Frankfurt DAX also reported 
substantial losses. In Dublin, the financial sector continued to weigh heavy on the market with AIB the biggest faller, 
losing a whopping 5.63pc. It closed 1.00 lower on 1675. Anglo Irish Bank also dropped 41c to 1069, while Bank of 
Ireland fell 37 to 1298 and Irish Life and Permanent shed 24c to trade at 1746. Construction stocks fared little 
better. CRH shed 80c to trade at 2290, Grafton fell 35c to 940, while McInerney was 45c lower at 1135. Kingspan 
stocks also took a battering, shedding 57c to 1215. Ryanair stocks fell after it was confirmed that Air France-KLM 
has resorted to legal action to prevent the Irish no frills airline establishing its first French hub in Marseilles. Reports 
this morning suggest that Air France has filed a case at France's top civil court, the Conseil d'Etat, alleging that 
Marseilles airport is breaching the law by offering discount airlines cut-price fees at its second, no-frills terminal. 
Ryanair plans to build a far-reaching network at the new hub in Marseilles, serving three cities in Morocco to cater 
to the large North African community in Provence. Shares in Ryanair were down 16c to 701. Elsewhere, Irish 
biotech firm Elan continued its decline, shedding 50c to 1175, while Independent News and Media fell 12c to 220. 
Dragon Oil was another faller despite news yesterday that it has successfully completed the work-over program on 
well Z60/66 on the Zhdanov Field, offshore Turkmenistan. The well was completed in Zones 8 and 9, and was 
tested at a rate of 350 barrels of oil per day, Dragon said. Prior to the work-over the well was not on production. 
Shares in Dragon fell 31c to 210. Irish bookmaker Paddy Power also saw its share price drop as the betting frenzy

By 1130 am the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 195.00 to 6997.12.
The ISEQ continues to fall in tandem with world markets amid concern over US and eurozone inflation and interest

Air France-KLM has resorted to legal action to prevent Ryanair establishing its first French hub in the southern city

 Eleven new routes will be in operation from November, with a target of 1.2 mln passengers within two years. Two

Body
The Dublin market gave back all of Friday's gains in early trading today as financial and construction stocks 
continued to weigh heavy after last weeks 0.25 basis point ECB interest rate rise.
By midday, the ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 71.03 at 7234.78.
ISEQ punters remain worried that the tightening ECB rate policy coupled with record domestic inflation could play 
havoc with both financial and construction stocks - the mainstay of the Dublin exchange.
 The financials were hit by profit taking this morning after posting modest gains on Friday. On the market today, AIB 
shares fell 39c to 1781, Bank of Ireland declined by 8c to 1350, Anglo Irish fell 25c to 1115 and Irish Life and 
Permanent dropped 30c to 1775. Leading construction stocks fared little better in morning exchanges. CRH shed 
25c to trade at 2397, Grafton fell 27c to 973, while McInerney edged 5c lower to 1175. Shares in troubled ceramics 
firm, Waterford Wedgwood, remained unchanged this morning despite the firm posting reduced operating losses for 
the year to the end of March of E130.8m. The losses, after exceptional items, were down by E47.8m on the 
previous year as sales from continuing operations rose to E772.6m, 10.4pc ahead of last year as a result of the 
acquisition of Royal Doulton. Company's chairman, Tony O'Reilly, said that the company's fortunes are on a 
'turnaround' with strong sales and a positive earnings performance expected this year. His optimistic words failed to 
entice investors however, with shares trading flat on 004. Elsewhere on the market, troubled Irish biotech, Elan, 
continued to suffer after it last week announced its pricing plan for multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, raising the 
wholesale cost of the drug to E28,000 per year per patient, up 21pc on its original launch price. Elan stocks were 
down 13c to 1225 in trading this morning. Meanwhile, shares in no frills airline Ryanair were able to buck the 
morning trend, up 7c to 725, while Independent News and Media also gained 3c to trade at 228.

European stocks fell to their lowest levels for six months yesterday as the sell-off in global equity markets showed 
no signs of abating.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index fell 33.8 points, or2.6 per cent, to 1,255.30, while the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt and the 
CAC 40 in Paris both tumbled 2.9 per cent. It was the fifth time in the past four weeks that the Eurofirst has fallen 
more than 2 per cent.
The benchmark has dropped 10.7 per cent from the near five-year closing high of 1,405.55 struck on May 9. Year-
to-date, the index is down 1.6 per cent.
Oil stocks came under pressure as US crude futures fell below Dollars 70 a barrel.
OMV declined 8.1 per cent to Euros 40.66, Norsk Hydro shed 7.9 per cent to NKr152.50 and Neste Oil fell 6.8 per 
cent to Euros 23.73.
Worries about a possible slowdown in global growth sent industrial groups sharply lower. Atlas Copco A shares fell 
8.4 per cent to SKr174, ThyssenKrupp declined 6.2 per cent to Euros 23.93, while German truckmaker MAN shed 
7.2 per cent to Euros 50.70.
Richemont, the luxury goods group, put in one of yesterday's worst performances after its full-year operating profits 
disappointed the market.
"There was a bit of a miss on the net profits line, and the company's outlook was not too warm, but the numbers 
weren't that terrible," said one trader in Zurich.
"Bear in mind that the shares have had a decent run in the last couple of weeks and the overall market is down 
heavily today."
WestLB maintained its "hold" recommendation on Richemont, with a target price of SFr62, saying that although the 
results came in below consensus the company had made a strong start to the year.
Eurofirst down 10% in a month EUROPE
The stock tumbled 12.3 per cent to SFr51.15. On a brighter note, French utility Suez moved ahead amid lingering 
speculation that Italy's Enel might still launch a bid for the French utility.
The French government appeared to have slammed the door on a potential cross-border bid by backing a Euros 
70bn merger of Suez with Gaz de France.
Suez shares pared an early rise to close 0.2 per cent higher at Euros 30.20, while GdF went into reverse and ended 
0.9 per cent weaker at Euros 26.19.
Fulvio Conti, Enel chief executive, said on Wednesday that he did not believe the game was over for the acquisition 
of Suez.
Enel shares fell 0.5 per cent to Euros 7.09.
In Dublin, Ryanair climbed 3.5 per cent to Euros 6.87 as investors took a second look at the low-cost carrier's full-
year results and outlook, released this week. The stock also benefited from the slide in crude oil prices, although 
other airlines failed to benefit. Air France-KLM fell 2.4 per cent to Euros 15.96 and Lufthansa shed 0.7 per cent to 
Euros 13.60.

The bounding self-confidence of Ryanair's chief executive provokes an unkind desire to see it punctured.
It is difficult to see this happening, though, when Michael O'Leary continues to present such solid evidence of good 
performance. The Irish low-cost carrier increased passengers and revenue more than expected in the year to 31 
March. Net income rose 12 per cent and unit costs rose only 5 per cent despite a 74 per cent increase in fuel costs 
over the year. The amount Ryanair earns from providing extra services such as car hire and hotel bookings 
continues to grow as a proportion of revenues and contributed strongly to a 2 per cent increase in revenue per 
passenger.
Given this, Mr O'Leary's boast that Ryanair will this year overtake Lufthansa as the world's largest international 
scheduled carrier is not as hubristic as it sounds.
There are still valid questions to ask about Ryanair's future performance. It is adding capacity at breakneck pace. 
Although Mr O'Leary says cutting costs is like peeling an onion - once one layer is uncovered, another layer reveals 
itself - unit costs other than fuel cannot stay on a downward path indefinitely.
Despite the good news yesterday, Ryanair shares are stuck where they were three years ago and trade on a 20 per 
cent forward price to earnings discount to low-cost rivals such as Easyjet and Southwest. The most pressing 
question for shareholders is therefore what Ryanair will decide to do with its cash pile, now approaching Euros 2bn. 
Mr O'Leary says, with some justification, that he believes airlines rarely make money from acquisitions, so it is 
unlikely to be squandered. Shareholders hoping for a juicy special dividend have good reason to expect that 
Ryanair's success will soon flow over to them.

Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost airline, yesterday gave a cautious forecast for profit growth this year of 5 to 10 
per cent in the face of continuing high oil prices and a rapid increase in capacity next winter.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, warned of "further price dumping by lossmaking competitors who will be 
trying to survive next winter".
He said Ryanair was still on track, however, to double its passenger volumes and profit by 2012.
It is likely to have become the leading European short-haul carrier, measured by passenger numbers, aheadof Air 
France-KLM and Lufthansa by the end of the decade.
The airline increased its pre-tax profit by 9.6 per cent last year from Euros 309m to Euros 339m (Pounds 233.8m) 
despite a 74 per cent increase in fuel costs. Average yields or fare levels increased by 1 per cent despite a 27 per 
cent growth in capacity as the airline benefited from many rival airlines raising fares through fuel surcharges.
Ryanair said it had hedged 90 per cent of its fuel requirements for the months from June to October at Dollars 70 a 
barrel.
The Irish group remains one of the world's most profitable airlines with a net profit margin of 18 per cent last year, 
down from 21 per cent a year earlier, compared with 7 per cent at Southwest Airlines in the US, 6 per cent at British 
Airways and 3 per cent at EasyJet.
Chris Avery, aviation analyst at JPMorgan, said Ryanair was generating "more consistent earnings growth than 
other airlines even at Dollars 70-a-barrel oil".
The group forecast that its passenger volumes would increase by about 20 per cent in the year to March 2007 to 
42m following a 26 per cent rise last year to 35m.
Ryanair has the youngest and most simple aircraft fleet of any sizeable carrier in Europe as a key element in 
maintaining the lowest cost base in the European industry.
Caution at Ryanair over high oil prices
It is planning to add 30 more aircraft by April to 133 - raising that figure to 234 by March 2012 on the basis of 
existing orders.
Mr O'Leary said the airline was planning to add two more bases to its 16 across Europe during the coming winter 
season.
He dismissed concerns that the expansion of the airline could be held back by a shortage of pilots.
Mr O'Leary said growth in ancillary revenues from sources such as internet booking of hotels, car hire and 
insurance was forecast to continue growing faster than passenger fare revenues and the group was close to 
finalising new moves to introduce onboard mobile phone services in 2007.
Turnover rose 28 per cent to Euros 1,693m and earnings per share rose from 36.85p to 40p. Ryanair shares fell 7 
cents to Euros 6.66 yesterday.

Charles Dunstone, chief executive of Carphone Warehouse, was in typically candid form yesterday as he updated 
the world on the take-up of the mobile phone seller's much-trumpeted "free" broadband service.
He dismissed ideas that he might buy Bulldog, the broadband provider, from Cable and Wireless, and predicted that 
Saturday will be "the worst retailing day of the year so far" as the industry competes with the attractions of the 2pm 
England-Paraguay kick-off in the World Cup.
But the day's first duty was a very early appearance on Radio 4's Today programme.
"I was just thankful that BAA didn't announce the Ferrovial deal till 8.20am," he told Mudlark.
From there, it was off to the City to do the rounds of institutions at the same time as another well-known self-made 
businessman.
"For some reason, we always seem to release results the same day as Ryanair and as I'm going round Michael 
O'Leary is usually cursing his way around the City," Dunstone laughed.

BAA accepts $19 billion takeover bid from Spain 's Ferrovial
BAA accepts $19 billion takeover bid from Spain's Ferrovial

Body
BAA PLC, the world's biggest airport operator, accepted a sweetened 10 billion pound ($19 billion) takeover bid 
from a consortium led by Spain's Grupo Ferrovial SA on Tuesday, rejecting a higher offer from a group led by 
Goldman Sachs.
Ferrovial also confirmed that it had bought 150 million shares, or 13.9 percent of BAA, early Tuesday, adding to its 
holdings and bolstering its position against any rival bid.
Goldman Sachs, however, urged BAA shareholders to take no action as it is reviewing its position suggesting the 
battle may not yet be over.
BAA, which had rebuffed Ferrovial's advances since the company's first approach four months ago, said the revised 
offer valuing it at 950.25 pence ($17.79) per share "represents an attractive price."
The announcement followed late-night bidding between the two consortiums for BAA, which operates seven 
airports in Britain including London's Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, a handful more in the United States and has 
stakes in the Naples and Budapest airports.
BAA kicked off a trend among European and Asian governments to privatize their airports in the 1980s when it took 
over operations in London and Scotland. Unlike the United States, where most air gateways remain government-
owned, Britain has no specific rules banning foreign majority ownership of such assets and few questions about 
national security have been raised.
Ferrovial's bid made up of 935 pence ($17.49) in cash and shares and a 15.25 pence (28.52 U.S. cent) per share 
dividend was lower than the 955.25 pence ($17.86) per share bid made by the consortium led by investment bank 
Goldman Sachs Inc.
BAA said Ferrovial's bid had a better strategic rationale but declined to comment further.
BAA accepts $19 billion takeover bid from Spain 's Ferrovial
Ferrovial has previously said it plans to keep together BAA's portfolio of British airports, but analysts said the deal 
would feed into calls within the airline industry for BAA's assets to be broken up ahead of an expected investigation 
by Britain's competition watchdog.
The Office of Fair Trading revealed last week that it is considering a full inquiry into the domestic airport market. 
Such a probe would look at whether the current market structure, and BAA's dominance, delivers the best value for 
air travelers.
BAA owns and operates airports that handle 63 percent of travelers to and from Britain, a figure that rises to 86 
percent in Scotland where BAA runs airports at Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen and to 92 percent in London. 
BAA also owns Southampton Airport in southern England.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC, a key user of London's Stansted airport, 
said the bid underlined the need for a breakup.
O'Leary said he hoped any new owners of BAA would make the operator more efficient and avoid over-investment 
in "gold-plated Taj Mahal palaces" that he says the operator is now building.
Air Canada Chairman Robert Milton said he was concerned that the higher level of debt to be taken on with the deal 
would mean airlines would be charged more to use BAA airports.
"It's hard to paint a happy picture on this at this time," Milton said at a conference in Paris.
British Airways PLC Chief Executive Willie Walsh was more positive about the deal, saying he was hopeful it would 
result in a third runway at Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport.
A new fifth terminal is due to be opened at Heathrow in March 2008 to help relieve congestion, but the British 
government has indicated that a third runway may be required in the longer term to handle an expected increase in 
passengers.
BAA shares gained 2.2 percent to close at 948 pence ($17.85) on the London Stock Exchange, continuing a climb 
ignited by takeover speculation that has seen it gain some 45 percent since the beginning of the year.
Ferrovial confirmed talk that it had been active in the market, buying 150 million shares early Tuesday at 950.25 
pence ($17.74) each.
Analysts said that would likely take Ferrovial's entire holding over 15 percent and make it more difficult for Goldman 
Sachs to muscle in because it would need to acquire 90 percent of the company to be able to forcibly buy out 
minority shareholders.
The Takeover Panel, which administers London's code on mergers and takeovers, agreed earlier Tuesday to a 
request from BAA to extend the deadline for offers for the company.
The Spanish-led coalition, which includes Canadian investment fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec and 
Singapore government fund GIC, must now post its offer documents by June 12, while the Goldman Sachs 
consortium has until June 16 to announce a firm bid or walk away.
Ferrovial first approached BAA in March with an offer valued at 810 pence per share. It lifted that to 900 pence last 
week, but was still rejected. The Goldman Sachs-led group made a preliminary offer of 870 pence a share in May, 
which BAA also dismissed.
BAA's international business includes managing the Indianapolis airport, and retail management at Baltimore, 
Pittsburgh and Boston-Logan airports.
Ferrovial holds a 60 percent stake in England's Bristol airport and 31 percent of Belfast City airport. It also manages 
the Sydney airport in Australia and Antofagasta airport in Chile, as well as 19 toll roads in Spain, Portugal, Ireland,

Oil price surge threatens post-9/11 airline recovery
Oil price surge threatens post-9/11 airline recovery

Soaring fuel prices could delay a return to profit for the US$450 billion (â¬350 billion) airline industry, its main global 
body has warned, as cost-cutting efforts fail to keep pace.
The International Air Transport Association, hosting airline executives at its annual meeting, raised its 2006 net loss 
forecast to US$3 billion (â¬2.3 billion) from US$2.2 billion (â¬1.7 billion).
Unless the price of oil stops rising, IATA chief Giovanni Bisignani said Monday, the sector is unlikely to meet its goal 
of averting a seventh straight year of net losses since the Sept. 11 attacks by breaking even next year.
The slowdown in the industry's recovery after total net losses had fallen steadily to US$3.2 billion in 2005 from 
US$13 billion in 2001 comes despite sustained efforts to control costs.
Over the same period, airlines raised their average labor productivity by one-third and slashed sales and distribution 
costs by 10 percent, according to IATA figures, helped by the widespread uptake of Internet booking services and 
paperless tickets.
"Oil is the wild card," Bisignani said Monday. "Prices are racing ahead of efficiency gains and robbing our 
profitability."
The price of oil rose back above US$73 Monday after Iran's supreme leader threatened to disrupt global supply if 
the West punishes Tehran over its nuclear program. Recent kidnappings in Nigeria have also helped to keep oil 
prices high.
The global airline industry returned to the black in 2004 in terms of operating profit which excludes hefty 
restructuring charges that result from layoffs and is forecast to earn US$7.0 billion (â¬5.4 billion) this year, after 
US$4.3 billion in 2005.
David Bonderman, chairman of low-cost airline Ryanair and a founding partner of the hedge fund Texas Pacific 
Group, said the industry is already reaching the peak of its cycle, whose movements have been "disguised by oil 
prices."
Oil price surge threatens post-9/11 airline recovery
He cited last year's record sales of 2,140 passenger jets by Airbus and Boeing Co., which have both said they 
expect well below half that combined tally in 2006.
"Today is as good as it gets for the airline industry. It's going to get worse," Bonderman said. "In two years' time, 
everyone will be canceling those airplanes."
Several U.S. carriers have been slowly emerging from bankruptcy in recent months.
Delta Air Lines Inc. CEO Gerald Grinstein confirmed Friday that the airline plans to seek the termination of its pilots' 
pension plan after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September.
Many long-haul carriers have supplemented their ticket prices with fuel surcharges. But these do not pass on the 
full extra cost to passengers, and airline executives said Monday they had reached the limits of the charges they 
could levy without hurting demand.
"The only saving grace is that this is a level playing field for all of us and that the fittest will survive," Singapore 
Airlines Ltd. CEO Chew Choon Seng said.

Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's most rapidly expanding airline, reported a 12.5 percent gain in full-year net profits 
Tuesday, despite absorbing a strong increase in the cost of jet fuel.
For the year ended March 31, Ryanair said its net profit rose to â¬301.5 million ($389US million) from â¬268.1 million 
the year before. Sales rose 28 percent to â¬1.69 billion ($2US.18 billion) from â¬1.32 billion. The company did not 
break out fourth-quarter results.
"This robust performance validates our lowest-fare, lowest-cost model, which continues to grow profitably in Europe 
even during adverse market conditions, when many of our competitors are reporting losses," Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary said.
Although the results were slightly better than analyst estimates, Ryanair shares fell 2.9 percent to close at â¬6.68 
($8US.60) amid wider, heavier losses on the Irish Stock Exchange in Dublin.
Ryanair said fuel costs rose 74 percent to â¬462 million ($596US million), while the company's other operating costs 
fell 6 percent over the year. It cited the efficiency of the airline's new Boeing 737-800 aircraft and better deals with 
airports.
Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said Ryanair had locked in its fuel supplies from July to October at $70US a 
barrel, about $2US lower than current prices.
Millar said Ryanair had suffered "a massive jump in our cost base" because of soaring oil prices and wanted to 
guard against even higher prices. He said the dollar's weakness versus the euro, while oil internationally was priced 
in dollars, was helping Ryanair.
During the year, Ryanair carried 35 million passengers, up 26 percent, on 330 routes across Europe, while its 
average price of tickets sold increased 1 percent. The airline plans to open 46 more routes this year, including a 
new hub in Marseilles, France.
Ryanair says profits, sales up despite `massive jump' in fuel costs
O'Leary forecast that passenger numbers would rise 20 percent to 42 million passengers in the coming fiscal year. 
He said profits were expected to grow 5 percent to 10 percent, presuming that oil prices stay near $70US a barrel.
Some analysts cautioned that Ryanair profits would suffer if the cost of oil heads higher after October.
"There's a lot of earnings uncertainty, as we don't know what oil prices will be like in the winter, when Ryanair will 
be unhedged," said Robert Brisbourne of Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin.

Ryanair, Europe's largest no-frills airline, has reported a better-than-expected 12pc increase in full-year adjusted 
net profit but cautioned investors to expect more modest growth of 5-10pc in the current year.
For the year to March 31 2006, the Dublin-based carrier made a record adjusted after tax profit of E302m. This 
compares to E268m last time and guidance of E295m issued by the company in February.
The profit performance was driven by a 26pc increase in passenger traffic to 35m passengers and a 1pc rise in 
yields or average fares. Total revenue increased 28pc to E1.69bn.
 Commenting on the results, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said: 'Ryanair has again delivered record traffic and 
profits despite substantially higher oil prices, intense competition and the absence of Easter from the fourth quarter.' 
'This robust performance validates our lowest fare/lowest cost model which continues to grow profitably in Europe 
even during adverse market conditions, when many of our competitors are reporting losses.' Excluding fuel, unit 
costs fell by 6pc. Including fuel they rose 5pc. Fuel costs rose 74pc to E462m. Ryanair's after tax margin was 18pc. 
Basic earnings per share rose 11pc to 35.28 cents.

Highlight: Ryanair has cautioned investors to expect more modest profit growth of 5-10pc in the current year.
Body
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair has cautioned investors to expect more modest profit growth of 5-10pc in the current 
year due to spiralling oil prices and the addition of new aircraft.
The warning came after the company announced this morning a slightly better-than-expected rise in full-year profit 
from E268m to E302m - up 12pc.
The airline said that it remained cautious about the current business year given that it expects its winter season to 
be hit by high oil prices, the cost of launching new routes and price competition.
 "We expect that profit growth will be more modest in the 5 percent to 10 percent range if oil prices remain at 
USD70 a barrel," the company said in a statement. Ryanair also attributed the more modest growth to the fact it will 
add 30 aircraft between September 2006 and April 2007 and launch a large number of new routes and bases at the 
worst time of the year. It expects passenger traffic to grow 20pc to 42m passengers and yields to be flat. The airline 
is 90pc hedged for June to October 2006 at an average price of USD70 a barrel but is unhedged from October. The 
company had said it would not start hedging again until oil fell back below USD60 a barrel, but prices have 
remained stubbornly above that level.

Airline pilots across the industry are flying more hours than they used to. European low cost carriers (LCC) admit 
that what used to be the regulatory limit for the total annual flying hours a pilot could work is now a target that must 
be met if the airline is to remain competitive.
This is just one pilot lifestyle change intrinsic to working for LCCs. And with other types of airline increasingly being 
forced to imitate the management techniques these cost-conscious carriers employ, some of these changes are 
creeping into other sectors of the industry. ?Low?cost carriers brought with them targets rather than just a rationale 
for operating. Airlines across the planet are now targeting increased pilot usage,? says EasyJet director of safety 
and security Capt Peter Griffiths.
Certain aspects of an LCC pilot?s lifestyle appear more benign than the work regime in other types of airline: 
Ryanair chief Michael O?Leary boasts his pilots sleep in their own beds every night, enabling a more stable family 
life. This is because Ryanair?s network is all short?haul, and it operates from 16 bases across Europe using locally 
based crews and aircraft. EasyJet, the other dominant European LCC, operates the same multi?base system and 
its flight and cabin crews are home at the end of every day. This sort of regularity of lifestyle is more than long?haul, 
charter or night freight carrier flightcrew can claim.
Underestimated
But LCC pilots fly multi?sector days with rapid turnarounds ? 25 or 30 minutes ? during which there is scarcely time 
for them to leave their seats. In the case of both EasyJet and Ryanair, the airspace they operate in is congested, 
complex and multinational. Griffiths says EasyJet is fully conscious of the intensity, and believes the effect of 
workload on pilot fatigue is underestimated, and largely disregarded in most flight-time limitation (FTL) regulations ? 
except in respect of the number of sectors allowed ? with flying hours considered the main contributor to fatigue.
Ryanair has, until recently, been rostering pilots on a pattern of five early-start days and three days off, followed by 
five late-start days and three days off ? 5/3/5/3 ? which is popular with crews because of its predictability, says 
director of air and ground operations David O?Brien. But despite what looks like a generous rostering system, the 
airline has found that many of its pilots hit the 900h annual limit specified by Europe?s Joint Aviation Regulations ? 
Time to change?
Flight Time Limitations (JAR FTL) before the year is over ? often two months earlier. As the airline runs the same 
rostering year for everyone ? 1 April to 31 March ? this can mean a crewing crisis as the end of March approaches. 
O?Brien says this reflects the efficiency of Ryanair?s operations.
Head of flight operations Ray Conway says Ryanair ?gets more flying per duty hour out of its pilots?. A part of the 
system that enables this efficiency is ?Crew?Dock?, the computer interface ? identical in the operations offices at 
all Ryanair bases ? at which crews obtain the essential trip briefing, including flight plan, notams, weather forecasts, 
company operational notices and all other pertinent information.
Ryanair pilots, while not disputing the fundamental basis for Conway?s claim, say the airline paints a rose?tinted 
picture of reality. What actually happens, they say, is that a pilot reporting at the specified beginning of his/her duty 
period faces a chance there will be a shortage of serviceable Crew?Dock stations in the operations room, so have 
to wait their turn. As a result crew have to arrive earlier than briefed to be certain of on-time departure. There can 
be further delay and stress, they say, if some printers do not work and crew have to wait to print out information 
they need to take with them.
Over the last two months, because the 5/3/5/3 roster has been causing crews to reach their 900h flight time limit 
before the year-end, O?Brien has been holding ?town hall meetings? with off-duty crews at each of Ryanair?s 
bases to propose what looks like a dream roster: five earlies/four off/five lates/four off. A massive majority of the 
crews decided it was too good to be true: their reaction ? except at the London Luton base ? was to turn down the 
new roster because, while the five duty days refer to flying, the four off refer to ?non-flying periods?. Mostly these 
would be time off, but compulsory annual medical checks, any form of training including recurrent checks in the 
simulator, and ground school would have to be taken during the four non-flying days. Finally, six times a year pilots 
would be liable to operate five days on, two days off if it became operationally necessary.
O?Brien?s explanation of the 5/4/5/4 deal to crews is complex, including the way it affects the annual leave 
entitlement. This may explain why the pilots rejected it in favour of sticking with the popular 5/3/5/3 routine, with 
training and medicals on duty days, despite being offered a better pay package if they accepted the 5/4/5/4 
proposal. Many Ryanair pilots told Flight International it would be more difficult to plan their private lives under the 
proposed scheme. But Ryanair will gradually introduce the 5/4/5/4 plan anyway, O?Brien says, by making it 
applicable to all new?hire pilots, anyone who moves from one base to another, and any individual pilot who 
chooses to accept it.
Maximum flying hours
Meanwhile, looking back two years, Ryanair?s efficiency in getting maximum flying hours out of its crew was 
becoming a problem for competitor EasyJet, which was also worried that the most efficient roster pattern UK Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations would allow was not the optimum for safety. Ryanair?s operations ? wherever 
they are based in Europe ? are overseen by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), whereas the CAA oversees all 
EasyJet?s operations. The CAA?s FTL rules, embodied in Civil Aviation Publication (CAP) 371, are in line with the 
JARs, but exceed the requirements in some respects. ?CAP371 doesn?t work in practice ? you have to go through 
contorsions to get reasonable work out of pilots,? says Ryanair?s O?Brien, explaining Easyjet?s problem. However, 
the IAA simply requires that Ryanair comply with the JARs, which the 5/3/5/3 roster does.
In 2002, to back up JAR approval, says O?Brien, Ryanair asked Dr Mark Rosekind, president and chief scientist of 
Alertness Solutions, to examine its rostering system. Basically, Rosekind, a psychologist and specialist in fatigue 
and sleep, found that the roster provided an ?excellent? combination of stability, rest opportunity and duty limits. 
Former head of the UK CAA Safety Regulation Group Michael Willett came to the same conclusion, as did Dieter 
Horst, director general of German aviation authority LBA.
Back in the UK, EasyJet was arguing that CAP371 forced the airline to adopt a roster that was resulting in a higher 
pilot fatigue risk than necessary because it had been written before the ?high productivity model? operated by the 
big European LCCs had evolved. The airline approached the CAA to discuss how to proceed. ?The move toward a 
Time to change?
new rostering protocol was driven by the internal uncertainty of the projections within CAP371 for a high productivity 
model,? says EasyJet?s Griffiths.
In managing its FTL regulations, the authority has used algorithms developed by UK company Qinetiq?s Centre for 
Human Studies to predict levels of performance and alertness in crews on given rosters, says CAA flight standards 
officer Derek Brown, who specialises in crew fatigue issues. Brown challenged Griffiths to prove EasyJet?s 
theories. If the airline could show safety at least equivalent with crews operating under a CAP371?approved duty 
regime, he said, the CAA would consider approving the alternative rostering pattern.
Risk management
EasyJet funded a fatigue risk management research programme involving 350 of its pilots, and in which the CAA 
took part. Two years later, Brown says, the study is still running, data is still coming in, and knowledge about 
rostering best practice still developing. But Griffiths? approach has been vindicated. The airline has been cleared 
for a roster that is more productive, and several different crew performance measurements have all shown that the 
new roster ? outside the limits of the un-amended CAP371 ? has produced significant pilot alertness improvement, 
along with a decrease in pilot mistakes and non?standard operating procedures (see charts).
Both airlines say that, despite their rapid expansion rate, they have no problems attracting staff. Ryanair?s O?Brien 
says the carrier ?is not having to chase down [Boeing] 737 pilots ? with the exception of some command 
requirements for the next two years?, while EasyJet?s new chief executive Andy Harrison says: ?We haven?t had 
significant issues in terms of getting the quality of people we need.?
The CAA?s Brown challenges this, saying ?EasyJet has not been good at predictive resource planning? in terms of 
the number of crews per aircraft as its fleet expands. The aviation industry as a whole, he says, ?is not nearly as 
good at this as manufacturing industry, which has operated effective predictive resource management for some 
30?40 years?.
Harrison says there is no question of compromising on safety or quality to accommodate the 15% annual growth 
EasyJet is achieving. ?Having an incident could well finish the company. Just the perception that there might be 
even a marginal increase in risk would be very bad for business,? he says. The airline?s safety audit results have 
reassured him that ?EasyJet has a top?notch safety management systems team?. He is referring especially to 
Griffiths? continual risk assessment work.
?If ? the same as every other LCC model ? you are pushing your assets to the extreme of what you can get them to 
do, what you want to know is: where?s the boundary?? says Griffiths. ?The reason we are doing [the flight crew 
scheduling study] is so that we know where the boundaries are, so that we can put in a safety margin and remain 
within it. Nine hundrd hours per year is the target, but you know even 600h badly managed can cause problems. If 
you are taking them to a higher extreme you want to know that you?ve got it right.?
Both airlines operate flight data monitoring (FDM) systems, and they back up the data gathered with crew written 
reports. EasyJet took up FDM three years ago, about the time it acquired Stansted?based airline Go, which had 
used the system since starting operations. Chief operating officer Mike Szucs says the first issue that FDM revealed 
in detail ?was unstable and rushed approaches?, and the locations at which they happened. ?Systematically we 
educated the crews in the risks and, having done that, we give them discretion to use their best judgement.?
Griffiths says the written reports are also important: ?The FDM will always tell you what went wrong, what 
happened to the aeroplane. The report provides the ?why? ? why did it happen?? Across EasyJet?s fleet of nearly 
100 aircraft Europe-wide, he says, there are about 600?700 pilot reports filed each month. Ryanair?s Conway says 
when FDM was introduced in May 2004 it had two noticeable effects: ?Pilot reporting increased dramatically, and 
sporty flying characteristics tended to die out.? He adds: ?It has thrown a huge safety net around the airline. It is a 
much more conservative operation now.?
But the safety net is not bullet?proof. A Ryanair internal report documents a flight on 7 September last year that 
carried out a series of abandoned approaches ? one of which came close to disaster ? to airports near Rome 
Time to change?
before finally landing safely (Flight International 24?30 January 2006). According to the report, the crew of a 
737?800 inbound to Rome Ciampino suffered ?almost complete loss of situational awareness, both lateral and 
vertical?, while attempting a diversion to Rome Fiumicino because of storms at Ciampino. The report ascribes this 
situation to high workload in turbulent weather and failure to follow standard operating procedures.
Report held up
The airline informed the IAA and Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) that the event had occurred, but Ryanair 
chief executive Michael O?Leary admits the carrier later ?screwed up? by failing to send them the final draft of its 
report. Italian air accident investigation agency ANSV?s decision to investigate came four months after the incident 
because, it claims, it was only handed details by the Irish AAIU in early January. Why the pilot ?lost situational 
awareness? will not be revealed until the ANSV inquiry reports.
Meanwhile some Ryanair flights into Stansted ? the airline?s biggest single operations base ? on 24 April, as well 
as those by aircraft from other airlines, are under investigation by the Irish AAIU and UK Air Accident Investigation 
Branch to determine whether they disregarded weather minima to land in poor visibility when it was well known to 
pilots that runway lighting was reduced because of maintenance. Whether the decisions by several pilots to land in 
conditions reported by Stansted as below minima was exacerbated by perceived schedule pressure or by traditional 
?get-home-itis? should emerge from the inquiry now under way. 
The most pertinent questions about the pressures on pilots operating the ?high productivity model?, as EasyJet 
calls it, seem to be emerging from groundbreaking pilot fatigue work by the CAA?s Brown as the authority continues 
working with EasyJet. Unlike the favourable paper appraisals on Ryanair?s pilot work-pattern model, this is a 
hands?on study that is examining external ? not just rostering ? influences on pilot performance and alertness. 
There has been no study of the effect on stress of the relationship between Ryanair?s management and its 
flightcrew, which not only keeps websites including the Ryanair European Pilots Association busy, but also the Irish 
judiciary (see below). Vigorous internal pilot debate about employment and operational issues is common to all 
airlines. It is just a matter of degree. ?

Ryanair takes a tough stance on the performance of its pilots. ?We have a zero-tolerance approach if crews fail to 
adhere to standard operating procedures,? says head of flight operations Ray Conway. Ryanair also exercises tight 
control over its operation. ?There is a conference call for all 16 bases at 08:00h each day following an email from 
each centre about local [punctuality] performance,? says deputy director flight operations Shay Warren. ?We chase 
3min delays. If a pilot reports a 1min delay it is because he thinks it needn?t have happened.? Shay says the 
purpose is not punitive, but simply to identify where punctuality problems occur and why.
Ryanair?s relationship with its pilots has been marred by litigation. The airline recently had to reinstate a senior 
captain after losing its Irish High Court case against him, and two other issues are still the subject of litigation, one 
concerning Irish employment law and the other the airline?s allegation that the Ryanair European Pilots? 
Association website repaweb.org has been a source of organised intimidation against its pilots.
It was against this background that all Ryanair bases except London Luton rejected the company?s offer to replace 
the five on/three off roster with five on/four off scheme that had conditions attached. These conditions were so 
complex that, although the Stansted base deal gave crews a net 11 extra days off per year clear of any duty, the 
rejection level was more than 90%, say the employee representative committees.
The fact that 12 of the 29 days? annual leave would be allocated by the company, where none had previously been 
proscribed, was a major factor, according to the committees, which say they were not consulted formally during the 
negotiations.

Highlight: flying hours to change
Body
Airline pilots across the industry are flying more hours than they used to. European low cost carriers (LCC) admit 
that what used to be the regulatory limit for the total annual flying hours a pilot could work is now a target that must 
be met if the airline is to remain competitive.
This is just one pilot lifestyle change intrinsic to working for LCCs. And with other types of airline increasingly being 
forced to imitate the management techniques these cost-conscious carriers employ, some of these changes are 
creeping into other sectors of the industry. ?Low?cost carriers brought with them targets rather than just a rationale 
for operating. Airlines across the planet are now targeting increased pilot usage,? says EasyJet director of safety

five late-start days and three days off ? 5/3/5/3 ? which is popular with crews because of its predictability, says 
director of air and ground operations David O?Brien. But despite what looks like a generous rostering system, the 
time to change?
airline has found that many of its pilots hit the 900h annual limit specified by Europe? Joint Aviation Regulations ? 
Flight Time Limitations (JAR FTL) before the year is over ? often two months earlier. As the airline runs the same 
rostering year for everyone ? 1 April to 31 March ? this can mean a crewing crisis as the end of March approaches. 
O?Brien says this reflects the efficiency of Ryanair? operations.
Head of flight operations Ray Conway says Ryanair ?gets more flying per duty hour out of its pilots?. A part of the 
system that enables this efficiency is ?Crew?Dock?, the computer interface ? identical in the operations offices at 
all Ryanair bases ? at which crews obtain the essential trip briefing, including flight plan, notams, weather forecasts, 
company operational notices and all other pertinent information.
Ryanair pilots, while not disputing the fundamental basis for Conway? claim, say the airline paints a rose?tinted 
picture of reality. What actually happens, they say, is that a pilot reporting at the specified beginning of his/her duty 
period faces a chance there will be a shortage of serviceable Crew?Dock stations in the operations room, so have 
to wait their turn. As a result crew have to arrive earlier than briefed to be certain of on-time departure. There can 
be further delay and stress, they say, if some printers do not work and crew have to wait to print out information 
they need to take with them.
Over the last two months, because the 5/3/5/3 roster has been causing crews to reach their 900h flight time limit 
before the year-end, O?Brien has been holding ?town hall meetings? with off-duty crews at each of Ryanair? bases 
to propose what looks like a dream roster: five earlies/four off/five lates/four off. A massive majority of the crews 
decided it was too good to be true: their reaction ? except at the London Luton base ? was to turn down the new 
roster because, while the five duty days refer to flying, the four off refer to ?non-flying periods?. Mostly these would 
be time off, but compulsory annual medical checks, any form of training including recurrent checks in the simulator, 
and ground school would have to be taken during the four non-flying days. Finally, six times a year pilots would be 
liable to operate five days on, two days off if it became operationally necessary.
O?Brien? explanation of the 5/4/5/4 deal to crews is complex, including the way it affects the annual leave 
entitlement. This may explain why the pilots rejected it in favour of sticking with the popular 5/3/5/3 routine, with 
training and medicals on duty days, despite being offered a better pay package if they accepted the 5/4/5/4 
proposal. Many Ryanair pilots told Flight International it would be more difficult to plan their private lives under the 
proposed scheme. But Ryanair will gradually introduce the 5/4/5/4 plan anyway, O?Brien says, by making it 
applicable to all new?hire pilots, anyone who moves from one base to another, and any individual pilot who 
chooses to accept it.
Maximum flying hours
Meanwhile, looking back two years, Ryanair? efficiency in getting maximum flying hours out of its crew was 
becoming a problem for competitor EasyJet, which was also worried that the most efficient roster pattern UK Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations would allow was not the optimum for safety. Ryanair? operations ? wherever 
they are based in Europe ? are overseen by the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), whereas the CAA oversees all 
EasyJet? operations. The CAA? FTL rules, embodied in Civil Aviation Publication (CAP) 371, are in line with the 
JARs, but exceed the requirements in some respects. ?CAP371 doesn? work in practice ? you have to go through 
contorsions to get reasonable work out of pilots,? says Ryanair? O?Brien, explaining Easyjet? problem. However, 
the IAA simply requires that Ryanair comply with the JARs, which the 5/3/5/3 roster does.
In 2002, to back up JAR approval, says O?Brien, Ryanair asked Dr Mark Rosekind, president and chief scientist of 
Alertness Solutions, to examine its rostering system. Basically, Rosekind, a psychologist and specialist in fatigue 
and sleep, found that the roster provided an ?excellent? combination of stability, rest opportunity and duty limits. 
Former head of the UK CAA Safety Regulation Group Michael Willett came to the same conclusion, as did Dieter 
Horst, director general of German aviation authority LBA.
Back in the UK, EasyJet was arguing that CAP371 forced the airline to adopt a roster that was resulting in a higher 
pilot fatigue risk than necessary because it had been written before the ?high productivity model? operated by the 
big European LCCs had evolved. The airline approached the CAA to discuss how to proceed. ?The move toward a 
time to change?
new rostering protocol was driven by the internal uncertainty of the projections within CAP371 for a high productivity 
model,? says EasyJet? Griffiths.
In managing its FTL regulations, the authority has used algorithms developed by UK company Qinetiq? Centre for 
Human Studies to predict levels of performance and alertness in crews on given rosters, says CAA flight standards 
officer Derek Brown, who specialises in crew fatigue issues. Brown challenged Griffiths to prove EasyJet? theories. 
If the airline could show safety at least equivalent with crews operating under a CAP371?approved duty regime, he 
said, the CAA would consider approving the alternative rostering pattern.
Risk management
EasyJet funded a fatigue risk management research programme involving 350 of its pilots, and in which the CAA 
took part. Two years later, Brown says, the study is still running, data is still coming in, and knowledge about 
rostering best practice still developing. But Griffiths? approach has been vindicated. The airline has been cleared 
for a roster that is more productive, and several different crew performance measurements have all shown that the 
new roster ? outside the limits of the un-amended CAP371 ? has produced significant pilot alertness improvement, 
along with a decrease in pilot mistakes and non?standard operating procedures (see charts).
Both airlines say that, despite their rapid expansion rate, they have no problems attracting staff. Ryanair? O?Brien 
says the carrier ?is not having to chase down [Boeing] 737 pilots ? with the exception of some command 
requirements for the next two years?, while EasyJet? new chief executive Andy Harrison says: ?We haven? had 
significant issues in terms of getting the quality of people we need.?
The CAA? Brown challenges this, saying ?EasyJet has not been good at predictive resource planning? in terms of 
the number of crews per aircraft as its fleet expands. The aviation industry as a whole, he says, ?is not nearly as 
good at this as manufacturing industry, which has operated effective predictive resource management for some 
30?40 years?.
Harrison says there is no question of compromising on safety or quality to accommodate the 15% annual growth 
EasyJet is achieving. ?Having an incident could well finish the company. Just the perception that there might be 
even a marginal increase in risk would be very bad for business,? he says. The airline? safety audit results have 
reassured him that ?EasyJet has a top?notch safety management systems team?. He is referring especially to 
Griffiths? continual risk assessment work.
?If ? the same as every other LCC model ? you are pushing your assets to the extreme of what you can get them to 
do, what you want to know is: where? the boundary?? says Griffiths. ?The reason we are doing [the flight crew 
scheduling study] is so that we know where the boundaries are, so that we can put in a safety margin and remain 
within it. Nine hundrd hours per year is the target, but you know even 600h badly managed can cause problems. If 
you are taking them to a higher extreme you want to know that you?ve got it right.?
Both airlines operate flight data monitoring (FDM) systems, and they back up the data gathered with crew written 
reports. EasyJet took up FDM three years ago, about the time it acquired Stansted?based airline Go, which had 
used the system since starting operations. Chief operating officer Mike Szucs says the first issue that FDM revealed 
in detail ?was unstable and rushed approaches?, and the locations at which they happened. ?Systematically we 
educated the crews in the risks and, having done that, we give them discretion to use their best judgement.?
Griffiths says the written reports are also important: ?The FDM will always tell you what went wrong, what 
happened to the aeroplane. The report provides the ?why? ? why did it happen?? Across EasyJet? fleet of nearly 
100 aircraft Europe-wide, he says, there are about 600?700 pilot reports filed each month. Ryanair? Conway says 
when FDM was introduced in May 2004 it had two noticeable effects: ?Pilot reporting increased dramatically, and 
sporty flying characteristics tended to die out.? He adds: ?It has thrown a huge safety net around the airline. It is a 
much more conservative operation now.?
But the safety net is not bullet?proof. A Ryanair internal report documents a flight on 7 September last year that 
carried out a series of abandoned approaches ? one of which came close to disaster ? to airports near Rome 
time to change?
before finally landing safely (Flight International 24?30 January 2006). According to the report, the crew of a 
737?800 inbound to Rome Ciampino suffered ?almost complete loss of situational awareness, both lateral and 
vertical?, while attempting a diversion to Rome Fiumicino because of storms at Ciampino. The report ascribes this 
situation to high workload in turbulent weather and failure to follow standard operating procedures.
Report held up
The airline informed the IAA and Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) that the event had occurred, but Ryanair 
chief executive Michael O?Leary admits the carrier later ?screwed up? by failing to send them the final draft of its 
report. Italian air accident investigation agency ANSV? decision to investigate came four months after the incident 
because, it claims, it was only handed details by the Irish AAIU in early January. Why the pilot ?lost situational 
awareness? will not be revealed until the ANSV inquiry reports.
Meanwhile some Ryanair flights into Stansted ? the airline? biggest single operations base ? on 24 April, as well as 
those by aircraft from other airlines, are under investigation by the Irish AAIU and UK Air Accident Investigation 
Branch to determine whether they disregarded weather minima to land in poor visibility when it was well known to 
pilots that runway lighting was reduced because of maintenance. Whether the decisions by several pilots to land in 
conditions reported by Stansted as below minima was exacerbated by perceived schedule pressure or by traditional 
?get-home-itis? should emerge from the inquiry now under way.
The most pertinent questions about the pressures on pilots operating the ?high productivity model?, as EasyJet 
calls it, seem to be emerging from groundbreaking pilot fatigue work by the CAA? Brown as the authority continues 
working with EasyJet. Unlike the favourable paper appraisals on Ryanair? pilot work-pattern model, this is a 
hands?on study that is examining external ? not just rostering ? influences on pilot performance and alertness. 
There has been no study of the effect on stress of the relationship between Ryanair? management and its 
flightcrew, which not only keeps websites including the Ryanair European Pilots Association busy, but also the Irish 
judiciary (see below). Vigorous internal pilot debate about employment and operational issues is common to all 
airlines. It is just a matter of degree. ?

Fuel slows Ryanair profit growth, but some fares cheaper than competitor surcharges
Fuel slows Ryanair profit growth, but some fares cheaper than competitor 
surcharges

A 74% increase in fuel costs failed to stop low-cost airline Ryanair turning in record profits, but the growth is slowing 
down.
The after tax profit of 302 million for the year to 31 March is around 7 million ahead of what the group had led the 
market to expect. The shares, down 2% at one point, are now 1.34% higher at 6.82, up 0.09.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary says the growth in both profit and traffic was a direct result of Ryanair's refusal to 
levy fuel surcharges on passengers at a time when other airlines like British Airways were increasing them.
'In some cases other airline surcharges exceed our average fares' he said. 'This is driving millions of passengers to 
Ryanair. We will continue to absorb significantly higher oil prices thanks to the benign yield environment and 
continuing unit cost reductions'.
With more expensive fuel pushing fourth quarter profits down 14%, the second consecutive three-monthly decline, 
O'Leary is understandably more cautious looking ahead. Although he expects passenger growth of 20%, he says if 
fuel remains around $70 a barrel profit growth will be down to around 5%.
Operating profit for the year before exceptional items rose from 328.8 million to 369.1 million, up over 12%. Profit 
before tax was 9.6% higher at 338.9 million against 309.2 million.
The exceptional items consist of a receipt of 5.2 million in the first quarter arising from the settlement of an 
insurance claim for the scribing of six Boeing 737-200 aircraft. Excluding fuel, unit costs fell 6%. Fuel costs rose 
74% to 462 million which if included meant a 5% rise in costs.
The group moved fast when there was a brief fall in oil prices and hedged 90% of its needs from June to October 
this year at an average of $70 a barrel.
It is unhedged from October onwards, but is looking for the right opportunity to do so. O'Leary points out that while 
hedging eliminates uncertainty and risk, it does not deliver lower costs during periods of rising oil prices.
During the year Ryanair took its remaining B737-200s out of service reducing the average of its fleet to 2.5 years, 
the youngest in Europe.
Fuel slows Ryanair profit growth, but some fares cheaper than competitor surcharges
Ryanair used 103 aircraft to carry 35 million passengers on 330 routes, 26% more than it did in the previous year. 
Revenue was up 28% to 1.69 billion and yields 1% higher despite a 27% increase in capacity.
The group plans to add 46 new routes this year and one new base at Marseille in November which together are 
expected to handle 42 million passengers, up 20%. An additional 30 aircraft are due to come into service between 
September and April 2007.

(Update) UK markets remained extremely nervous after another initial hefty mark-down that followed a mauling on 
Wall Street caused by the US Federal Reserve chairman's warning on inflation. By 9.30am the FTSE 100 index 
was still around its low level of the day at 5,701, down 61 points, the Mid-250 index was trailing 142 points weaker 
at 9,210 and the techMARK 26 points easier at 1,347. In Europe the German DAX was down 59 points and the 
CAC-40 in France was 74 points lower. BAA stood out like a beacon at 949p, up 21p, as it accepted an increased 
950p-a-share offer from Ferrovial, while Boots at 738p and Alliance Unichem 967p added 2p and 21p as they 
posted their merger documentation to shareholders. 
Severn Trent also did well at Â£11.74, up 17p, on its plans to demerge its Biffa waste unit and return capital to 
shareholders, while renewed hopes of a Credit Agricole bid excited Alliance & Leicester at Â£12.47, up 18p. 
Elsewhere shares were down in the dumps as investors steered clear amid fears of higher US interest rates to curb 
the inflation threat. Oils fell back with the crude price as European Union officials arrive in Iran for talks on the 
uranium issue. BP shed 8p to 828p and Royal Dutch Shell 27p to Â£18.18. Mining shares also succumbed to profit-
taking with falls of between 39p and 97p in BHP Billiton at Â£10, Antofagasta Â£19.52, Rio Tinto Â£27.75 and Xstrata 
Â£19.61. Other major fallers among the leaders were AstraZeneca at Â£28.71, Carnival Corporation Â£21.11. Corus 
Group Â£391p, Man Group Â£23.81. Next Â£16.39, Persimmon Â£11.76, Wolseley Â£11.74 and Schroders Â£10.20, 
between 12p and 43p easier. Among companies reporting Victrex stood out at 736.5p, up 36.5p following a 32% 
jump in first-half profits, while Carphone Warehouse improved 4p to 335p after confirming strong demand for its 
new 'free' broadband service. Intermediate Capital slipped 60p to Â£12.72p after profits in line with expectations and 
profits at the low end of estimates clipped 3p from Uni1 at 127p. Ryanair edged up a few cents to 6.85 after figures 
and others to please included Umeco at 477p, Telecom Plus 112p, Mobestar 44p, Dentmatters 353p and Dee 
Valley Group Â£10.40, between 2p and 10p higher. Lower profits knocked 21p from Helical Bar at 385p, while 
favourable news failed to help Christian Salvesen at 61p, down 2p or RPC Group, 4p lower at 229p. Robert 
Wiseman Dairies hardened 2p to 328p on the acquisition of Milk Link's fresh liquid milk businesses and Tricorn

High fuel costs have hit Ryanair margin with 2005 net margin down to 18pc from 20pc as world crude oil prices 
soared. 
Ryanair's fuel needs were un-hedged for much of 2005 where they took advantage of the recent short- term fall in 
oil prices to hedge 90pc of their needs from June to October at an average price of USD70 a barrel.
Speaking at the full- year results announcement today, the no- frills airline said, "Accordingly we remain cautious 
about our profit guidance for the coming year. Whilst we are confident that traffic will grow by 20pc to 42 million 
passengers and yields will be flat, we expect that profit will be more modest in the +5pc and +10pc range if oil 
prices remains at USD70 a barrel."
 Ryanair said that they refuse to allow higher oil prices to distract them from aggressively pursuing unit cost 
reductions and operating efficiencies.
