Jul 10, 2021( Business Matters: http://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 A group of leading travel businesses including Ryanair, BA, travel business Tui and Manchester Airports Group 
have launched legal action against the government over its travel curbs. 
They want more transparency over how the government takes decisions on Covid travel rules. 
 In particular, they want to know how it assesses the Covid threat in destination countries. 
 The action is going ahead despite an easing of travel rules on Friday. 
 The chief executives of the groups involved said in a statement: 'British consumers need to understand how 
decisions are made so they can confidently plan their travel, which is why we are asking the government to provide 
the data and advice that is underpinning its decision making.' 
 The rules on travel now mean that, starting from 19 July, fully-vaccinated British residents returning from so-called 
amber list countries, which are deemed a medium-risk, will no longer have to quarantine on arrival back in the UK. 
 The traffic light system rates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. 
 Red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and 
they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. 
 There are still just a handful of 'green' destinations, which tend to be smaller islands, for example, Malta. 
 Major holiday destinations, such as Spain, Greece, France and the US, remain amber. 
 Fewer than 30 destinations are on the green list, while more than 50 countries are on the red list. 
 Travel companies have long complained they have little idea how the government makes decisions on travel rules. 
 The group wants a wider re-opening of travel. 
 Airlines and travel companies say the limits on trave lhave had a devastating impact on the industry. 
 Their case, which is against the transport minister Grant Shapps, was heard at London's High Court on Friday. 
 The Department for Transport spokesperson said its traffic light system was intended to manage the risk of new 
variants, and added that the department could not comment on legal proceedings.

LONDON (AP) — A group of British airports and airlines took the U.K. government to court Friday, demanding it 
disclose the evidence behind its coronavirus travel restrictions that they say is ruining their business.
Manchester Airports Group, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, brought the case along 
with airlines Ryanair, Virgin Atlantic and easyJet, travel business Tui and British Airways’ parent company, IAG. The 
travel businesses say the government’s “traffic light” system of classing countries as low, medium or high risk, is not 
transparent.
“We are told it is a risk-based approach, so what we say is that the criteria and the reasons must be sufficiently 
accessible,” The group’s lawyer, Tom Hickman, said at a High Court hearing in London on Friday. He said there 
was a “fundamental lack of transparency” and the categorizations appeared arbitrary.
Only 27 countries and territories are on the “green list” which allows British residents to travel there without having 
to quarantine on return. Arrivals from dozens of “amber list” countries have to self-isolate at home for 10 days, while 
people arriving from “red list” countries including India and Brazil must quarantine in a government-approved hotel.
The government says it will lift the self-isolation requirement for fully vaccinated Britons returning from amber list 
countries on July 19.
The government’s lawyer, David Blundell said that “decisions need to be made urgently, in response to emerging 
data” and forcing disclosure of all the evidence “would lead to a serious risk of delay in a decision-making process.”
The two judges hearing the case plan to give their ruling at a later date.

Britons going on holiday are being warned to expect big queues at UK airports due to a shortage of immigration 
staff.
Grant Shapps, Transport Secretary, yesterday relaxed controls countries on the amber list for Covid-19 risks, 
sparking a rush to book holidays in places such as Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece.  
Airline EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) today reported it had seen a 400% jump in enquiries, while British Airways 
(LON:IAG) has seen a surge in traffic to its website as people checked out potential flights overseas.
Shapps also said this morning that non-UK residents might also soon be able to come here without having to 
quarantine if they can prove they have had two jabs.
The current rules only apply to people who been vaccinated in the UK, but the government is working on a change, 
he said.
 "We want to be able open that up for people. We're actively working on it," Shapps told Sky News.
"In the next couple of weeks I'll be able to come forward and say more about other locations in the world."
The EU has been running a digital Covid certificate scheme since the start of July everywhere but Ireland and 
Shapps flagged that there would be changes to the NHS's app to incorporate European visitors.
However, the US will be more difficult he added most of the vaccination programmes are state-based and largely 
use paper.
Holiday bookings surge as government eases amber list rules
More details about allowing in overseas-vaccinated visitors would be made within a couple of weeks, Shapps added
After the changes yesterday, UK residents going to an amber-listed country no longer have to self-isolate when they 
return, though they still have to have to take Covid-19 tests before coming back and within two days of arriving.
Shares in airlines rallied again today with easyJet up 2.3% to 938p, IAG up 2% to 185p and Ryanair PLC 
(LON:RYA) 2.1% up at (EURO)16.35.

       U.K. stocks rebounded on Friday, with a weaker pound and gains in the mining sector offering some support.
 Travel stocks also gained ground after the government said that from July 19, fully vaccinated U.K. residents and 
children will no longer have to quarantine on their return to England.
 Investors shrugged off data showing the U.K. economy expanded at a slower pace in May despite an easing of 
COVID-19-related restrictions.
 Gross domestic product grew 0.8 percent month-on-month in May, but slower than the revised 2 percent growth 
posted in April and the economists' forecast of +1.5 percent. Nonetheless, GDP rose for the fourth straight month.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 jumped 64 points, or 0.9 percent, to 7,095 after ending 1.7 percent lower the previous 
day.
 Miners rebounded, with Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore all rising more than 2 percent.
 Travel-related stocks such as easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways-owner IAG were up around 3 percent.
 Aircraft and car parts supplier Senior advanced 1.2 percent after raising its guidance for the financial year.
 Victrex, a supplier of high performance polymer solutions, gained 1.4 percent after its third-quarter Group revenue 
climbed 37 percent from last year.
 Luxury goods group Burberry jumped 3.4 percent after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to "buy."

7 Lithium Stocks That Will Power the Electric Vehicle Boom[2] Demand for lithium is set to increase exponentially in 
the next few years. In fact, according to Statista, demand for lithium may very well double to 820,000 tons in that 
time. Some of that demand will come from companies that are manufacturing the batteries that we use every day. 
For example, lithium is an essential component of the batteries that power our mobile devices. 
 But the real growth will come as the United States goes all-in on electric vehicles (EVs). The Biden administration 
recently announced plans to have the U.S. government's fleet of over 600,000 vehicles converted to EVs. 
 And as you're aware, EV stocks are in a bubble of some sort at the moment. Some of that is due to the increasing 
number of companies that went public last year. However, as investors are beginning to realize, not all of these 
companies will be the next Tesla. In fact, some of these companies may never be successful at bringing an EV to 
market, at least not at the scale that will be required. 
Travel firms sue UK government over its travel restrictions
 The ones that do make it will need lithium and lots of it. To help you sift through the best lithium stocks to buy, 
we've put together this special presentation.

Quarantine restrictions are to be scrapped for people visiting amber list countries who have had two vaccinations, 
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed today.
The new rules come into force from 19 July, said Shapps, adding: "This means that people will be able to travel for 
leisure, for business and to see families in amber list countries."
It means people can go on holiday in places such as Spain, Portugal, Greece and France without having to self-
isolate for ten days when they return.
Travellers will still be required to take a Covid-19 test before they return to the UK and also on day two on arrival 
back, but the requirement for a test eight days after returning has also been dropped.
Children under 18 will be exempt from quarantine as long as they are travelling with a fully vaccinated adult.
Effectively, it means that for people who are fully vaccinated, amber list countries have the same restrictions as 
green listed countries, with the government's advice not to travel to amber countries for holidays also ending.
There were no changes to the rules surrounding the highest Covid risk or red-listed countries, said Shapps, who 
added that the government will monitor the infections situation in each country, which could be quickly upgraded to 
red if there is an outbreak or a new variant detected.
"The UK has achieved many hard-won gains through our successful vaccination programme, through the continued 
spirit and determination of the British people.
Airlines and families celebrate as amber list travel restrictions eased
"19th of July will mark the next step of this cautious re-opening of international travel.
Airline shares jumped to the top of the risers or what otherwise was a tough day for London markets.
Travel bosses though were still critical of the requirement for expensive PCR tests and called for these to be 
scrapped as well.
Sean Doyle, British Airways' chief executive, said more countries need to be added to the green list to cut the need 
for "unnecessary, expensive tests".
Johan Lundgren, easyJet CEO, added: "We do not want to see a return to flying being a preserve of the rich and 
expensive testing could sadly make travel out of reach for some this summer."
British Airways owner IAG (LON:IAG) rose 1.4% to 183.3p even though there was no news on a travel corridor 
between the two countries.
Intercontinental travel between the UK and US  has traditionally been a big earner for the airline group.
EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) rose 1.9% to 922p though Ryanair was little changed at (EURO)16.30.

As the coverage of vaccination increases and restrictions placed on travel due to Covid-19 decrease, Riga Airport 
offers to the passengers from the Baltic States a wide network of routes with more than 95 destinations for the 
summer season.
This summer, flights from Riga are planned by a total of 12 airlines offering regular passenger flights, and two 
carriers providing charter flights. Alongside the largest carrier, the national airline airBaltic, in near future the 
following companies have renewed or plan to renew their work at Riga Airport: the Finnish airline Finnair, Polish 
carrier LOT, German airline Lufthansa, Irish and Hungarian low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizzair, Turkish airline 
Turkish Airlines, Uzbek airline Uzbekistan Airways, Norwegian low-cost airline Norwegian, and Russian carriers 
Aeroflot and Pobeda.
After a break that lasted 14 years, the airline operating out of Great Britain, British Airways, will return to Riga 
Airport this summer, and in August they plan to begin flights to Heathrow airport, London.
This summer, regular charter flights from Riga are offered by Aegean Airlines and Smartlynx.
The wide network of routes from Riga Airport include both the most significant European air traffic hubs and popular 
business, recreation and culture destinations in Europe and Asia. The top of this season's news includes Aegean 
island Santorini; Italian cultural and architectural gems of Naples and Pisa; Alicante and Valencia, Spanish cities by 
the Mediterranean; Tenerife in Canary Islands; and the magnificent and exotic Dubai.
Whereas, if you are a transit traveller, Riga Airport will offer you convenient and fast transfer options for travel to 
farther destinations.
At the same time, the Airport would like to remind that due to restrictions to mitigate pandemic in Latvia and in other 
countries, the travellers should pay special attention to requirements set for transfer points and the destination of 
travel. These requirements may include both a requirement to present the digital EU Covid-19 certificate or another 
form of attestation of vaccination or recovery, and a necessity to undergo a Covid-19 test before flight, as well as 
restrictions to movement and self-isolation. If any of the necessary documents is missing, the passenger might not 
be allowed on the flight.
Riga Airport offers a wide range of destinations for safe travels during the summer season
Information on requirements for travellers to foreign countries may be found on the website of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, website www.reopen.europa.eu, or at the embassy of the relevant country. You can read of the 
conditions set for entry into Latvia on the website of the Airport, section titled Covid-19: FAQ.
The Airport would also like to remind that travellers should arrive to their flight in a timely manner, especially if the 
passenger would like to do a Covid-19 test before the flight. The traveller should also be aware that currently the 
pre-flight procedures require a longer time than usual because the volume of documents to be checked has 
increased. To facilitate the process of document verification, the Airport invites the passengers to collect all 
necessary travel documents in a paper or electronic format, and to prepare it for presentation in a timely manner.
To ensure a safe and pleasant travel, the Airport also invites the passengers to comply with the requirements of 
epidemiological safety at the airport and during the flight: wear your mask, sanitize your hands, and keep the 
distance.

US finalizes Belarus air travel restrictions after aircraft diversion

 A Ryanair aircraft, which was carrying Belarusian opposition blogger and activist Roman Protasevich and diverted 
to Belarus, where authorities detained him, lands at Vilnius Airport in Vilnius, Lithuania May 23, 2021. 
REUTERS/Andrius Sytas 
The US Transportation Department finalized an order on Tuesday (6 July) banning ticket sales for air travel 
between the United States and Belarus, acting after Minsk forced a Ryanair flight to land and arrested a dissident 
journalist who was aboard, writes David Shepardson. 
The department on June 29 had issued a show cause order proposing the restrictions after the U.S. State 
Department determined that limiting travel between the United States and Belarus was in Washington's foreign 
policy interest in light of the diversion of the Ryanair (RYA.I)[1] flight. 
The order, which is effectively immediately, also applies to "interline" travel in which tickets are purchased through 
one airline that contain flights operated by multiple airlines. 
Under consideration by the US government for several weeks, the order is mostly symbolic since relatively few 
tickets are purchased for travel to Belarus from US-based travel services. 
The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) said in written comments it strongly supports the action, adding the 
"aggressive and unwarranted interception of a passenger aircraft over Belarus is a flagrant violation of Belarus's 
obligations ... and flaunts accepted norms of international behavior." 
ALPA urged the department "to ensure that all measures of sanctions at State's disposal are deployed to compel a 
final and apologetic resolution by Belarus. A message should be sent that aggressive action against civil aircraft will 
be met with a swift and appropriate response to deter similar conduct by any other would-be state actors." 
US finalizes Belarus air travel restrictions after aircraft diversion
After the 23 May forced landing of the Ryanair flight, which was en route from Athens to Vilnius, the US government 
advised passenger airlines to use "extreme caution" when flying over Belarus. At the time, however, the United 
States stopped short of imposing any restrictions. 
The order allows the US government "to make case-by-case exceptions for any transportation deemed to be in the 
national interest of the United States, including on humanitarian or national security grounds".

Good News For The Travel Sector 
"After months of stomach turning turbulence, the travel sector has flown into brighter skies with the announcement 
that double vaccinated UK travellers would be able to return from countries graded as amber on the UK travel list, 
without needing to quarantine. 
Warren Buffett, Diversified Retailing And Capital Allocation 
In 1966, Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and their partner, Sandy Gottesman, formed a holding company, 
Diversified Retailing Company, Inc., to "acquire diversified businesses, especially in the retail field." According to 
Alice Schroeder in The Snowball, soon after the deal was agreed, Buffett, who owned 80% of the company, went 
over to his bank to try Read More[4] 
 The news immediately pulled British Airways owner IAG, easyJet and Ryanair out of another tailspin and onto a 
flight path back into positive territory. IAG topped the FTSE 100 risers' board for a short time, rising by around 2% in 
early afternoon trade before falling back, amid hopes a surge in transatlantic travel will finally boost its fortunes. 
Travel Sector Flies Into Brighter Skies
 A lift-off in flight bookings is now expected, and the airlines have been keen to stress they are ready to move 
quickly to capitalise on pent up demand. Tour operator TUI also surged away from losses, with expectation of a 
flood of enquiries for last minute package holidays. 
 The relaxation of the rules also gave Rolls Royce a recovery boost, with shares gaining ground after morning 
losses. The group's core business is servicing and delivering wide body aircraft engines, which are used primarily 
for long-haul flights, so now its longer term prospects now look a little brighter. 
 However, worries will persist that although British travellers might have a freer pass to travel, the spread of the 
Delta variant may lead to other countries imposing tougher quarantine rules on visitors. Testing requirements are 
also likely to continue to be a headache and an added expense for tourists, so could dampen demand a little. 
 The new rules also sparked a gradual recovery for Premier Inn owner Whitbread which had been languishing down 
by more than 4% during the morning. Domestic Covid isolation rules have been causing havoc for the hospitality 
sector, and tough rules on incoming tourists had restricted business, so the opening up has been met with some 
relief from investors. 
The FTSE 100 And The FTSE 250 Sink Into The Red 
But overall the cheers from the England terraces last night haven't been reflected in trading screens today with the 
FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 sinking into the red, as the spectre of inflation hovers amid concerns about the global 
recovery from Covid. 
 The combined chants of central banks that price rises wouldn't be sustained over the longer term have hit a note of 
discord with Federal Reserve officials saying the recent inflation jump was higher than expected, and that the mass 
bond buying programme may need to be scaled back sooner rather than later. 
 Sectors such as transportation and hospitality have already reported worker shortages and now the recent update 
from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation is adding fuel to the wage rise fire. The survey showed hourly 
rates for temporary workers have spiked, increasing at the fastest rate since 2004 in June. 
 Alongside the inflation warning lights, and potential withdrawal of economic stimulus, come concerns that the Delta 
variant could trip up recovery in countries around the world, particularly with the effectiveness of vaccines coming 
under question. 
Persimmon Down More Than 4% 
Persimmon's investors were pessimistic, and the house builder was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 by early 
afternoon, down more than 4%, despite numbers out showing a bulging order book, an acceleration of build rates 
and higher selling prices. Indications that the housing market is cooling has nudged sentiment down, amid 
nervousness about high covid transmission rates in the UK. 
 Although miners are usually seen as a hedge against higher inflation, they were not immune to the sell off with 
Anglo American, Glencore and Antofagasta falling as concerns about the slowing economic recovery led to 
expectations of lower demand for metals and minerals. 
 Financial stocks like Barclays and Lloyds were also deep in the red zone, as falling bond yields leads to worries 
that net interest rates will stay lower for longer, eating into margins the banks can earn on loans. 
 Risers on the FTSE 100 board are few and far between today, with Entain on the small island of gainers. It was up 
around 0.7% by early afternoon after it revealed net gaming revenue rose 11% in the first half. England's Euro 
progress is also likely to boost its earnings from sports wagers, and Just Eat Takeaway was up by around 0.8% 
with investors speculating it could also benefit from the take out trend with all eyes on screen next Saturday.'

 Nasha Niva, one of Belarus' oldest newspapers, is the latest independent media organization in Belarus to be 
targeted by authorities over its reporting.Authorities in Belarus on Thursday blocked the website of Nasha Niva, a 
leading online media outlet, and detained several of its journalists.

The block is the latest in a widespread crackdown on independent media in Belarus. Last year, the government 
faced a massive protest movement against strongman President Alexander Lukashenko.

The Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) said police carried out searches of Nasha Niva's offices, and 
detained its editor-in-chief, Yahor Martsinovich, along with editor Andrey Skurko. Their apartments were also 
searched.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will open a third base in Morocco by stationing two B737-800s in Agadir, from where it 
plans to open 16 new routes to seven European countries in the winter of 2021/22, the airline announced.
The announcement was made at a media briefing by Ryanair chief executive Eddie Wilson and Moroccan National 
Tourist Office chief executive, Adel el Fakir, in Taghazout, near Agadir, recently.
Ryanair in a statement said the stationing of the two aircraft represents an investment of USD200 million in Agadir 
Airport and the creation of 60 direct jobs.
The Irish budget carrier will operate a total of 25 routes from Agadir, representing 55 departing flights weekly, 
including to Italy (Bologna, Rome Fiumicino, Naples Capodichino), Ireland (Dublin Int'l), Spain (Porto, Alicante, 
Seville, and Barcelona El Prat), and France (Paris Beauvais and Toulouse Blagnac). The airline currently already 
serves Agadir from Brussels Charleroi, Bordeaux, Düsseldorf Weeze, Frankfurt Hahn, and Marseilles, the ch-
aviation schedules module reveals.
Wilson said the aim is to establish Agadir as a leading winter holiday destination for Europeans. He said Ryanair 
had served the airport since 2008. "As Morocco has the most effective vaccination campaign in Africa, we want to 
continue to support the economic recovery as well as the regional and international connectivity of Morocco and 
position Agadir as a leading winter destination, with superb hotels, restaurants, and golf courses in the new 
Taghazout Quarter," he added.
Ryanair's existing two Moroccan bases are in Fes and Marrakech.

 KEY POINTSAlexander Lukashenko says will stop flow of goods to Russia and ChinaThe U.S. has banned sale of 
air tickets between Belarus and United StatesTensions have been high following the arrest of journalist Roman 
Protasevich 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Tuesday threatened to stop the flow of European Union products 
through his country as the U.S. joined the EU in sanctioning Belarus. 
The EU sanctioned Belarus after a MiG-29 fighter plane intercepted a Ryanair flight that carried opposition journalist 
Roman Protasevich and forced it to land in Minsk in May. Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia SapeTga were 
arrested after the plane landed. 
Many of the country's main export industries are impacted by the EU sanctions. 
According to The Hill, the U.S. Department of Transportation on Tuesdday finalized the order that bans the sale of 
flight tickets[1] between Belarus and the United States in retalation for that action. 
However, the Belarusian president clapped back with a warning during a government meeting. 
Reuters reported that Lukashenko warned of not allowing EU goods to pass through his country. 'First: not a step 
inside the Belarusian market; second: not a step through Belarus[2] either,' he said. 
'Let [Germany] supply their products to China and Russia through Finland or through Ukraine,' was reported as 
saying. 'In other words, we must take all measures to make them feel what Belarus is and think before they take up 
economic weapons.' 
Lukashenko went on to threaten that German products would be affected if he stops the flow of goods that pass 
through Belarus before arriving at their destined markets. 
Tensions have been running high between the EU and Belarus over the past few weeks. 
According to the Deutsche Welle, Lukashenko has been cracking down on the opposition[3]. He has imposed 
media restrictions to prevent opposing sides from disputing his win after last August's election. 
Protasevich, who is a critic of Lukashenko, was transferred to house arrest last week. He is faced with multiple 
charges, including alleged inciting of mass unrest. 
Belarus Threatens EU Over Sanctions, Says Will Halt Transit Of Goods To China, Russia
Meanwhile, U.N. Special Rapporteur Anas Marin demanded that Belarus free more than 500 jailed people 
considered by human rights groups as 'political prisoners.' 
In a report to the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Marin cited the arrest of Protasevich as a 'form of purge that 
recalls those practised by totalitarian states[4].' 
The U.S. has been coordinating with other countries in the bloc in sanctioning Belarus following the arrest of 
Protasevich. The U.S. and EU states have also criticized the imprisonment of top Lukashenko opponent Viktor 
Babaryko. 
Babaryko was found guilty of money-laundering charges and has been sentenced to 14 years[5], BBC reported. 
The U.S. and the UK have condemned the decision, with the UK embassy stating it will fight for the rights of 
Babaryko and other prisoners jailed on 'political charges.'

 WASHINGTON (AP) — The Transportation Department issued a final order Tuesday that blocks most travel 
between the United States and Belarus, underscoring Washington's concern about the recent forced landing of a 
passenger jet to arrest a dissident Belarussian journalist.  
 The order, which was requested by the State Department, bars airlines from selling tickets for travel between the 
two countries, with exceptions only for humanitarian or national-security reasons. 
 The Transportation Department proposed the ban last week and said Tuesday that it received no objections. There 
are no direct passenger flights between the U.S. and Belarus. 
 In May, Belarussian officials ordered a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, to land in Minsk, where 
authorities removed journalist Raman Pratasevich from the plane and arrested him. Pratasevich faces a possible 
15-year prison term.  
 President Joe Biden has called the forced diversion an 'outrageous incident' and joined others in calling for an 
international investigation. 
Featured Article: Outstanding Shares, Buying and Selling Stocks[1] 
7 Stocks That Can Help You Profit From Summer Shortages[2] One of the lingering impacts of the Covid-19 
pandemic is the supply chain disruptions that continue to bedevil many sectors. By now, every investor is aware of 
the global chip shortage that is disrupting many sectors that were projected to have strong growth in 2021. 
 But there are many more sectors that are being affected by supply chain disruptions. And this affects everything 
from big-ticket items like cars to everyday items like pet food and even bacon. 
 The focus of this special presentation is seven companies that stand to benefit from the current disruption in the 
supply chain. All of these companies delivered strong gains in 2020. Some of them have weakened in 2021, but 
that was before the full extent of the supply chain weakness was discovered. 
 As the economy reopens, the shortage of items is likely to continue and become much more notable. When they 
do, many of these stocks may get overpriced. That's why now is the time to get in on these stocks that can help you 
work the supply chain in your favor.

 A court in Belarus on Tuesday sentenced one of strongman Alexander Lukashenko's leading critics to 14 years in 
prison on fraud charges. 
Former banker Viktor Babaryko was arrested in June last year ahead of a disputed presidential election that 
sparked nationwide demonstrations which gripped the ex-Soviet country for months. 
Babaryko had planned to run for president and was considered one of the strongest opponents to incumbent 
Lukashenko, who has been in power for close to three decades. 
Babaryko was accused of receiving bribes and "laundering funds obtained by criminal means" when he was head of 
Belgazprombank, the Belarusian branch of a bank belonging to Russian energy giant Gazprom. 
Prosecutors had requested a 15-year sentence, the maximum possible punishment. Babaryko denied any 
wrongdoing throughout his trial. 
Belarus's Supreme Court on Tuesday handed down a 14-year sentence that is not subject to appeal, an 
independent journalist reported from the court. 
Babaryko's Twitter account, which is run by supporters, said he would serve the 14 years "in a maximum security 
colony". 
 Babaryko was also fined the equivalent of about 45,000 euros ($53,000) and barred from holding senior official 
positions. 
Seven other defendants in the case, including several Belgazprombank executives, were prosecuted on the 
charges. 
They all pleaded guilty and on Tuesday were sentenced to terms of between three and six years.

Several key opposition figures were arrested in Belarus last year ahead of the presidential vote, clearing the way for 
Lukashenko, 66, to secure a sixth term. 
Lukashenko's only rival was Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a political novice who took the place of her jailed husband in 
the vote and quickly gained popularity. 
Her husband Sergei Tikhanovsky was arrested after announcing his presidential bid and spent over a year in 
detention awaiting his trial, which started in late June. 
Belarus Opposition Figure Babaryko Jailed For 14 Years
The leader of Babaryko's presidential campaign, Maria Kolesnikova, and his lawyer Maxim Znak are also in custody 
and have been charged with "conspiracy to seize power". 
Despite Lukashenko's proclaimed victory, the opposition believes Tikhanovskaya was the true winner and that the 
vote was rigged. 
Tens of thousands took to the streets of Belarus for weeks to protest the result but were met with a harsh police 
crackdown. 
Authorities have also clamped down on independent media, jailing journalists over their coverage of the protests 
and withdrawing accreditation from foreign outlets. 
Western powers have responded with a wave of sanctions against Lukashenko's regime, especially after a Ryanair 
passenger flight between European capitals was grounded in late May in Minsk and authorities detained opposition 
activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend who were on board.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Transportation Department issued a final order Tuesday that blocks most travel 
between the United States and Belarus, underscoring Washington's concern about the recent forced landing of a 
passenger jet to arrest a dissident Belarussian journalist.
The order, which was requested by the State Department, bars airlines from selling tickets for travel between the 
two countries, with exceptions only for humanitarian or national-security reasons.
The Transportation Department proposed the ban last week and said Tuesday that it received no objections. There 
are no direct passenger flights between the U.S. and Belarus.
In May, Belarussian officials ordered a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, to land in Minsk, where 
authorities removed journalist Raman Pratasevich from the plane and arrested him. Pratasevich faces a possible 
15-year prison term.
President Joe Biden has called the forced diversion an “outrageous incident” and joined others in calling for an 
international investigation.

 For some, it took last year's brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators protesting Belarusian dictator Aleksandr 
Lukashenko's attempt to steal the presidential election to realize how awful life has been under his reign. For 
others, it was the May hijacking of a Ryanair flight to apprehend a Belarusian journalist on board. For those of us 
who have been watching Belarus closely, however, Lukashenko's recent behavior has been no surprise. 
 A year after coming to power through an election in 1994 that was considered largely free and fair, Lukashenko 
ordered his forces to shoot down a hot air balloon[1] that had floated across the border from Poland, killing two 
Americans. From there, Lukashenko racked up a long track record of repression and brutality. In 1996, he changed 
the constitution to consolidate his grip on power. In 1999 and 2000, he had four people disappeared[2]: the political 
dissident Viktar Hanchar, the businessman Anatol Krasouski, former Interior Minister Yury Zakharenko,and the 
cameraman Dzmitry Zavadski. Lukashenko continued to go after any perceived political threat. He rigged elections 
and had challengers to his leadership disqualified from running, harassed, and arrested. A number of activists and 
opposition figures fled the country for their freedom and lives, including one of the authors of this article.

 A year after coming to power through an election in 1994 that was considered largely free and fair, Lukashenko 
ordered his forces to shoot down a hot air balloon[3] that had floated across the border from Poland, killing two 
Americans. From there, Lukashenko racked up a long track record of repression and brutality. In 1996, he changed

and had challengers to his leadership disqualified from running, harassed, and arrested. A number of activists and 
opposition figures fled the country for their freedom and lives, including one of the authors of this article. 
 Over the years, the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Lukashenko and other members 
of his regime for election fraud and jailing political prisoners. When Lukashenko released the prisoners, the West 
lifted its sanctions, and then the pattern repeated itself. Lukashenko proved skillful at playing Russia and the West 
The West Gets Serious With Lukashenko—but Not Serious Enough
off each other, trusting the West to ease its pressure in order to avoid pushing Minsk closer toward Moscow. 
Lukashenko pretended to be the great defender of Belarus's sovereignty and independence when, in fact, he was 
sacrificing both to secure Russian support in the face of Western sanctions. 
 Things took an even worse turn in 2020. The year began with Lukashenko's criminally negligent handling of the 
coronavirus pandemic. He told Belarusians they could ward off the virus by taking a sauna, riding a tractor, or 
drinking vodka. It continued with his arrest of opposition figures who planned to challenge him in the presidential 
election, his blatant stealing of that election last August, and after that, the worst crackdown on human rights in his 
27 years in power. 
His decision in May to force down a Ryanair flight over Belarusian airspace to arrest a critic of his regime was a 
step too far for many in the West, as the EU responded immediately by banning its airlines from flying over 
Belarusian territory and banning Belavia, the Belarusian state airline, from EU airports. A month later, the EU, 
Britain, Canada, and the United States issued the toughest sanctions yet on Lukashenko, his regime, and some of 
his financial supporters. Better late than never, yet more needs to be done. 
 The EU sanctionsimposed[5]on June 21 targeted 78 Belarusian individuals and eight entities; on June 24, the 
EUannouncedfurther sanctions[6] targeting the Belarusian economy, in particular its potash and oil 
industries.Washington targeted 16 individuals and five entitiesbut did not go as far as the EU. 
 How serious are the sanctions? It's unclear. Industry analysts with the Russian investment bank VTB Capital 
said[7] in a note that the 'measures do not cover the key Belarusian potash export, potassium chloride, which 
accounts for 80% of the country's supplies to the EU.' Another analyst, however, told[8] EUobserver that the 
sanctions were 'very sharp' and designed to hurt the income of Lukashenko's cronies. 
 Either way, the sanctions seem to have led the regime in Minsk to release Roman Protasevich, the Belarusian 
journalist on the hijacked Ryanair flight, from prison and put him under house arrest instead. He and his Russian 
girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, were tortured while in detention[9]. During their imprisonment, they appeared on state 
television, clearly under duress, praising Lukashenko and renouncing their past activities. They are not free, but 
getting out of Belarus's notorious prisons is a first step. 
 Protasevich's release would not have happened without the pressure from Western sanctions, especially those of 
the EU. Now, the West must not fall back into its previous pattern of easing up on sanctions after securing a 
prisoner release—not least because there are still more than 500 political prisoners in Lukashenko's prisons, 
according to the Human Rights Center Viasna[10]. 
 At the same time, Belarusian prosecutors in late June said they would seek a 15-year prison sentence for Viktor 
Babariko, the former head of a Russian-owned bank who planned to challenge Lukashenko in last August's election 
but was arrested months before. Babariko's case is just one of many reasons why the EU and the United States 
must continue to apply sanctions until Lukashenko steps down. 
 Lukashenko's departure, after all, is the only way for Belarus to have the opportunity to hold free and fair elections, 
end the brutal crackdown on protesters, secure the release of all political prisoners, start the process of 
accountability, and begin a new chapter in the country's life. Nothing short of his removal from power will do, and 
the West must continue to close off his financial support and tighten the noose around him to produce such a result. 
 This includes targeting Lukashenko's Russian oligarch backers, or 'moneybags.' Following the Ryanair hijacking 
and the West's robust response, Russian President Vladimir Putin invited Lukashenko to the Russian Black Sea 
resort town of Sochi for what appeared to be their chummiest meeting in years. While there is no love lost between 
Putin and Lukashenko, the Russian leader clearly does not want to see his Belarusian counterpart driven from 
power by his people. That might set a bad precedent for Russia itself, as evidenced by Putin's reaction to earlier 
revolutionary movements in Ukraine and Georgia. 
 Of the various steps announced in June, the most significant was the EU sanctions against Mikhail Gutseriev[11], a 
Russian billionaire whom the EUdescribed[12] as a 'long-time friend' of Lukashenko. In Belarus, Gutseriev owns 
Slavkali, which is building the Nezhinsky mining and processing plant, Slavneft gas stations and oil depots, a hotel, 
a business center, and an airport terminal in Minsk. 
 Last year, according to the EU sanctions document, 'Russian media workers were flown to Belarus on board of 
aircraft belonging to Gutseriev' in order to replace workers fired from Belarusian state media during the post-
election crackdown and were lodged in a Gutseriev-owned hotel in Minsk. According to the EU sanctions list, one of 
the companies he controls in Russia, Safmar, was the only supplier that continued to ship oil to Belarus after Russia 
cut other oil shipments[13] in January 2020. Since being sanctioned, Gutseriev has left the board of directors[14] of 
The West Gets Serious With Lukashenko—but Not Serious Enough
the oil company RussNeft, one of his family's assets, presumably to protect its business. The United States, 
Canada, and Britain did not include Gutseriev on their sanctions lists. The three countries and the EU also did not 
add his son to the sanctions list, despite his heavy involvement in the family's business[15]. These oversights need 
to be corrected. 
Similar sanctions should be applied to Sberbank and its CEO, Herman Gref. As stated in an Atlantic Council 
report[16], 'Sberbank. has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into Belarusian real estate and has its own 
Belarusian subsidiary. Gref has expressed his full support for [Lukashenko] during numerous visits to Minsk.' Three 
other Russian state financial institutions—VTB Bank, VEB.RF, and Gazprombank—play key roles in the Belarusian 
banking sector and should also be sanctioned. 
 Russian companies with eyes set on taking over assets in Belarus should be targeted as well. These include the 
state-controlled gas company Gazprom, the oil companies Slavneft and Rosneft, and the potash producer Uralkali. 
Uralkali, in particular, has long desired to acquire Belaruskali, the world's biggest potash producer, though EU 
sanctions make a takeover less likely. 
 Russian propagandists—including employees of the Russian state broadcaster RT brought to Minsk—should be 
added to the list. They are not journalists but dangerous lackeys of the regime. 
 Then there are those in Belarus who have enabled the Lukashenko regime. Aside from those complicit in the 
regime's human rights abuses, Lukashenko and a small circle of oligarchs have essentially privatized and taken 
over the country's top assets. Lukashenko knows that unification of Belarus with Russia would likely strip him and 
his cronies of these assets, which is why he is dragging his feet on moving ahead with the single state as 
envisioned by the Kremlin. But Russian oligarchs have eyed Belarusian enterprises and increased their control over 
the Belarusian economy. The West needs to make clear that any deals signed with the illegitimate Lukashenko 
regime will not be recognized by a successor government. 
 As Brian Whitmore of the Atlantic Council observed[17]: 'Authoritarian kleptocracies like those run by Putin and 
Lukashenka have long been able to have it both ways, reaping the benefits of a rules-based international order and 
an integrated global economy while at the same time flouting the rules that make such a system operate smoothly. 
Sanctioning the Putin-Lukashenka axis of autocrats and their enablers sends a clear signal that those days are 
over.' 
 Western pressure against the Lukashenko regime must continue until he steps down. To those concerned that 
tougher sanctions against Lukashenko will drive him further into Putin's arms, he is already there. Without Putin's 
political, financial, and security assistance, Lukashenko would have been finished long ago. Lukashenko has 
already sacrificed Belarus's independence and sovereignty by deepening his reliance on Russian support. That is 
why including Russian backers among the sanctions is so important. Lukashenko's days are numbered, and now is 
no time for the West to let up. 
 Finally, there are plans for the exiled democratic leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya to visit the United States this 
month. During his recent trip to Europe, U.S. President Joe Biden should have met with her in a show of solidarity 
with the Belarusian people, and the G-7 should have invited her to join its gathering. These missed opportunities 
can be offset by a proper welcome in Washington, including a meeting with Biden and members of the U.S. 
Congress. 
 Over the past 10 months, numerous European leaders have met with Tsikhanouskaya as the democratic 
representative of the people of Belarus and the rightful winner in last August's election. Lithuania has been hosting 
her while her husband remains in one of Lukashenko's prisons. At the end of May, the EU proposed a $3.7 billion 
assistance package[18] to take effect 'once Belarus embarks on a democratic path.' It would be important for the 
United States to make a similar offer during her visit. 
 Tsikhanouskaya's upcoming visit to Washington is an opportunity for the United States to demonstrate its steadfast 
opposition to Lukashenko and his Russian backers—and to reaffirm its solidarity with the Belarusian people and the 
forces of freedom around the world.

Jul 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, United Airlines UAL[1] announced that it placed an order for buying 270 narrow-body jetliners. 
Notably the order, which includes Boeing and Airbus jets, is the largest-ever order in the history of this Chicago-
based carrier. 
JetBlue Airways JBLU[2] also grabbed headlines by virtue of its decision to start operating non-stop flights between 
Boise and the New York City. Notably, this seasonal service, which started operating from Jul 2, is the only non-
stop flight connecting Boise and the Northeast. It is aimed at meeting the anticipated demand swell during summer. 
Meanwhile, the European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[3] June traffic was impressive as wide-spread 
vaccinations in addition to the easing of restrictions in the EU led to an uptick in air-travel demand. Recap of the 
Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. In line with its objective to realize its post-COVID growth plan, United 
Airlines, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), placed an order to purchase 200 Boeing 737 MAX and 70 
Airbus A321neo jets. The airline aims to replace the older, smaller mainline and regional jets with larger aircraft. 
United Airlines expects the newer aircraft, featuring more premium seats with larger overhead bins and seatback 
entertainment screens, to improve fuel efficiency by 11% as well as reduce carbon emission per seat by 17-20% 
from the older ones[4]. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
2.With air-travel demand improving in the United States as more and more people are getting vaccinated every day, 
Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[6] announced that it intends to broaden its domestic network by adding three 
routes later this year. As part of this expansion drive, Allegiant announced that the new nonstop flights from the 
Melbourne Orlando International Airport (MLB) to Pittsburgh, PA, Nashville, TN and Concord, NC will take off in 
November 2021. Per the schedule, flights on the MLB-Pittsburgh route will operate from Nov 11 while non-stop 
flights connecting MLB with Nashville and Concord will take to the skies on Nov 18. Allegiant will operate flights on 
all the new routes twice a week[7]. 
3. Following JetBlue's decision to launch flights to Boise, the site became the low-cost carrier's first destination in 
the state of Idaho. Notably, flights on the new route connecting Boise Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy 
International Airport are operating four times a week through Labor Day this year. Notably, the same flights will 
return in the summer of 2022. Notably, JetBlue operates Boise flights using its Airbus A320 aircraft.[8]

4. Reflecting improved air-travel demand, Ryanair Holdings' June traffic jumped to 5.3 million guests in June from 
0.4 million guests a year-ago. The carrier's load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) in the month was 72%. 
Also, in the same period, Ryanair operated in excess of 38,000 flights. 
Notably, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary recently painted a rosy picture with respect to bookings following the onset 
of the summer holidaying spell. This was mentioned in the previous week's writeup[9]. 
5. Alaska Air Group's ALK[10] subsidiary Alaska Airlines announced a codeshare agreement with Qatar Airways, 
thereby expanding its partnership with the oneworld alliance member. This new agreement offers Alaska Airlines' 
customers a wider connectivity to various locations in Qatar and other middle-eastern countries as well as in Africa 
and South Asia. With international travel demand gradually recovering as countries reopen their borders to 
vaccinated travelers, the codeshare agreement should help boost traffic for Alaska Airlines[11]. Performance The 
following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green in the past week leading the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index to gain 1.5% to $100.14. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
appreciated 22.4%. What's Next in the Airline Space? With air-travel demand continuing to move north, more 
updates on route additions by the airlines are expected in the coming days. Zacks Names 'Single Best Pick to 
Double' From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in 
months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive 
upside of all. 
You know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it's poised for a monster turnaround. 
Fresh from a successful repositioning and flush with A-list celeb endorsements, it could rival or surpass other recent 
Zacks' Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in a little more than 9 months and 
Nvidia which boomed +175.9% in one year.

Jul 06, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[1] June 2021 traffic surged to 5.3 million guests from a mere 0.4 million in the year-ago 
period when air-travel demand hit rock bottom amid large-scale travel restrictions and rising coronavirus cases. 
The airline attributed the improvement in traffic to increased vaccinations in the European Union, which is in turn 
driving recovery in air-travel demand. Having operated more than 38,000 flights in June, the European low-cost 
carrier's load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) was 72%. 
Ryanair's June traffic figure represents a significant improvement from 1.8 million guests in May. The airline's traffic 
in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 was 8.1 million with a load factor of 73%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, traffic 
was 
extremely 
tepid 
at 
0.51 
million.

 Despite this improvement, traffic continues to significantly lag the pre-pandemic (2019) levels. While first-quarter 
fiscal 2022 traffic has increased substantially from the fiscal 2021 figure, it is way below 41.8 million in the first 
quarter of fiscal 2020 (pre-pandemic). Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation [4]sector are C.H. Robinson Worldwide CHRW[5], 
Expeditors International of Washington EXPD[6] and ArcBest Corporation ARCB[7]. While C.H. Robinson carries a 
Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Expeditors and ArcBest sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) each. You can see the complete 
list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8]. 
Shares of C.H. Robinson, Expeditors and ArcBest have rallied more than 16%, 65% and 100% in a year's time, 
respectively. Zacks Names 'Single Best Pick to Double' From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have 
chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz 
Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

       European stocks were mixed on Monday as the fast-spreading delta variant of the novel coronavirus raised 
fears of an uneven and fragile global economic recovery.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Saturday the 
world is currently in a very dangerous period of the pandemic and the delta variant is continuing to evolve and 
mutate.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 was marginally lower at 456.59 after closing 0.3 percent higher on Friday.
 Underlying sentiment remained supported somewhat after a survey showed business activity in the euro zone hit a 
15-year high in June.
 The U.K. services sector continues to rebound from the pandemic, but price pressures jumped by the most on 
record, adding to inflation fears.
 Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence rose to 29.8 from 28.1, but missed expectation of 30.2.
 The German DAX dropped 0.3 percent and France's CAC 40 index was marginally lower while the U.K.'s FTSE 
100 edged up 0.2 percent.
 Skanska, a Swedish development and construction company, was down 0.7 percent. The company has signed a 
contract with the New York City Economic Development Corp. to construct a new municipal health lab in Harlem, 
New York, USA.
 Shares of Wm Morrison Supermarkets soared 11 percent after the company reached agreement to be acquired by 
Fortress Investment Group (UK) Ltd. for 254 pence per share in cash and dividend.
 Travel stocks gained ground in London, with Ryanair Holdings, EasyJet and IAG climbing 1-3 percent as tourism 
and aviation bosses urged the government to add more destinations to the U.K.'s green list for international travel.
 Glencore advanced 1.8 percent. The commodity company has announced the appointment of Kalidas 
Madhavpeddi as the new Chairman on July 30.

Lukashenko orders closure of Belarus border with Ukraine - BelTA

Jul 05, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 Belarus' leader Alexander Lukashenko (pictured) on Friday (2 July) ordered the closure of the border with Ukraine, 
seeking to block what he called an inflow of weapons to coup-plotters detected by his security services, BelTA state 
news agency reported, write Andrey Ostroukh in Moscow and Natalia Zinets in Kyiv, Reuters. 
The move appears to deepen a standoff between Belarus and outside powers angered by his government's forcing 
down of a Ryanair flight in May and arrest of a government critic who was on the aircraft. 
Western countries imposed sanctions on Belarus to punish it for the action, and the European Union and Ukraine 
have also banned Belarus-registered flights from entering their airspace. 
Lukashenko, who has repeatedly accused Western ill-wishers of trying to oust him from power, said he had ordered 
a purge across the country, and rebel groups that were planning to carry out a coup had been uncovered in 
Belarus. 
"They have crossed the line. We cannot forgive them," he said. 
Speaking at a gathering marking the country's Independence Day, the veteran leader said Germany, Lithuania, 
Poland, Ukraine and the United States were behind the alleged rebel activity, BelTA reported. 
"A huge amount of weapons is coming from Ukraine to Belarus. That's why I ordered border-security forces to fully 
close the border with Ukraine," Lukashenko said. 
Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesperson, Oleh Nikolaenko, said Ukraine had neither interfered in Belarus' domestic 
affairs nor was it planning to do so in the future. 
Lukashenko orders closure of Belarus border with Ukraine - BelTA
"The Ukrainian side has not received an official notification from Belarus on the border closure. It would be primarily 
the Belarus people to suffer from such a step," Nikolaenko said. 
Belarus shares a border with Ukraine in the south. It borders Poland and Lithuania in the west, Latvia in the north, 
and Russia in the east. 
The move to shut borders with Ukraine comes days after Belarus recalled its permanent representative to the 
European Union for consultations after Brussels imposed economic sanctions. 
But Lukashenko, who was also sanctioned by the West for a sweeping political crackdown, is seen largely 
unscathed by the penalties and able to continue financing the economy and his security forces, rating agencies and 
analysts have said. Read more[1].

With the UK banning petrol and diesel vehicle sales from 2030, the sector is under pressure to establish 
infrastructure, including supply of batteries, to produce electric cars at scale and protect jobs. ? United Airlines has 
placed an order for 270 jets, the biggest in its history, in a bet on a resurgence of premium travel.
The Chicago-based company said it was ordering 200 Boeing 737 Maxes and 70 Airbus A321neos and expected to 
create 25,000 jobs by 2026 linked to the order.
Burst of dealmaking BEST OF BUSINESS
United's plans are the latest signs of divergence between US and European airlines' strategies.
As the pandemic ebbs in the US, more US carriers are placing orders, but European rivals are still looking to 
conserve cash.
Low-cost carrier Ryanair was one to buck the European trend in December with an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max 
jets with a list price of $22bn.
?Associated British Foods, Primark's parent, said sales had risen above pre-pandemic levels as restrictions lifted 
and people rushed to refill wardrobes with clothes for social occasions.
JD Sports, which has made a string of acquisitions during the pandemic, raised full-year profit guidance on 
"enhanced levels of consumer demand".
The bullish announcements from the two British groups came hours after US retailer Gap announced it would close

Number of jets United has ordered as the pandemic ebbs and remain only available online in the countries, putting

? Investor mania for special purpose acquisition companies is accelerating in the Gulf, where Abu Dhabi sovereign 
fund Mubadala is poised to launch two Spacs and a Dubai-based asset manager is raising $200m to target mergers 
with companies in the Middle East.
Regional financiers have for months been planning an expansion into the booming market for blank-cheque 
companies, which first list on a stock market before searching for a company with which to merge.
Mubadala had been approaching potential investors for two Spacs focusing on technology and healthcare, said 
people briefed on the meetings.
Interest in Spacs has slowed in recent months after some disappointing share price performances and increasing 
regulatory scrutiny in the US.
In the Gulf, however, investors have worried about missing out on gains.

Wizz Air will hand its chief executive Jozsef Varadi a £100m bonus if he can rapidly boost the low-cost airline as it 
emerges from the pandemic, setting up one of the biggest payouts from a London-listed company.
Varadi will need to more than double Wizz's share price from £48 to £120 over the next five years to hit the one-off 
award, which would be paid in shares over a four-year period, according to documents sent to shareholders ahead 
of the company's annual meeting.
The potential payout underlines Wizz's aggressive expansion plans across Europe, as well as its reliance on Varadi 
to execute them. It would leave the Hungarian better paid than almost all his peers in European airlines, including 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary.
Varadi's 2019 contract included a (EURO)99m payout from stock options, dependent on the airline's share price or 
profitability over five years.
Other big payouts in the UK include Bet365's £421m package for Denise Coates for the year to the end of March 
2020, which made the founder of the private gambling company the bestpaid executive in the country.
Tim Steiner, chief executive of Ocado, ranked as the highest paid chief executive of a FTSE 100 company in 2019, 
taking home £58.7m. He is expected to receive up to £100m over five years if shares continue to rise.
Wizz Air boss set for £100m bonus if growth target is hit Airlines
Varadi, one of the airline's founders in 2003, has built it into a top player in European aviation due to an ultra-
lowcost business model.
The £100m is the maximum Varadi can be paid if the share price increases at a compound annual growth rate of 20 
per cent over five years. Anything between a 10-20 per cent growth rate will lead to him being paid between £20m 
and £100m. Varadi also faces an emissions and gender diversity target.
Barry Eccleston, chair of Wizz's remuneration committee, told shareholders the payout was needed to ensure 
Varadi committed his future to the Hungarybased airline. He has taken a pay cut during the pandemic, with a 
(EURO)1.97m salary this year.
Shareholders will need to back the package at the company's annual meeting on July 27.

FTSE 100 was in good cheer ahead of the US non-farm numbers and England's quarter final on Saturday. 
London's blue-chip index rose by 28 to 7,153 with the consensus for around 700,000 jobs to have been added in 
the US last month.
Sir Richard Branson has gazumped Amazon boss Jeff Bezos plan to be the first billionaire in space. The bearded 
tycoon announced his Virgin Galactic ship will take him up on 11 July or nine day ahead of Bezos' planned trip into 
orbit.
Ryanair's passenger numbers jumped to 5.3mln in June from 1.8mln in May with the airline carrier saying travel is 
starting to recover within the EU thanks to the vaccine roll-out.
WizzAir carried 1.5mln passengers from 500,00o a month earlier. Oil prices hit a new two-year high despite 
confusion over the outcome of yesterday's OPEC+ meeting. Brent crude rose to US$75.50 even though the UAE 
has apparently vetoed a plan to raise production by 400,000 barrels a day.
Confectionery giant Haribo said driver shortages might stop its sweets reaching the UK. The German-based firm is 
the latest to flag the problem, with hauliers saying the UK might be short as many as 100,000 truckers due to Brexit 
and Covid restrictions.
Among the small caps. I3 Energy PLC (LON:I3E) said it is "very pleased" with the outcome of the drilling operation 
at its first Marten Hills Clearwater well in Canada. Drilling on the well started in mid-June.

The US Department of Transportation (DOT) has tentatively proposed to ban all passenger ticket sales, including 
on an interline basis, for travel between the US and Belarus in response to the May 23 state-backed forced 
diversion of a Ryanair aircraft over the eastern European country.
The DOT said it acted upon an earlier request by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who recommended limiting 
flights between the US and Belarus.
"Accordingly, the DOT tentatively finds that it is in the public interest to condition the authority of all US and foreign 
carriers to the extent necessary to prohibit the sale of passenger air transportation, including air transportation on 
an interline basis, between the United States and Belarus," the Department said.
In technical terms, the ban will be enforced by adding an appropriate condition to all existing and future certificates 
for US carriers and foreign carriers authorised to operate to the country. The DOT gave all parties two days to 
comment. The decision will become effective immediately upon the finalisation of the order. The only exception 
from the ban will be for "transportation deemed to be in the national interest of the United States, including on 
humanitarian or national security grounds". Cargo flights are also excluded from the scope of the order.
According to the ch-aviation schedules module, there are no direct scheduled flights between Belarus and the 
United States. After all European carriers suspended flights to Belarus in the wake of the May incident, the pool of 
airlines selling connecting itineraries between the two countries has also plummeted. Currently, the only airlines 
operating scheduled passenger flights to both Belarus and the US are Aeroflot, Turkish Airlines, Uzbekistan 
Airways, and Air China.

Lukashenko Claims Western-linked 'Terrorist Sleeper Cells' Exposed In Belarus
Lukashenko Claims Western-linked 'Terrorist Sleeper Cells' Exposed In

 Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko on Friday claimed authorities had exposed "terrorist sleeper cells" that 
he alleged were linked to Germany, the United States, Ukraine and other countries. 
The latest volley of eyebrow-raising claims came after the West targeted key sectors of the struggling Belarusian 
economy with sanctions to punish the Lukashenko regime for a crackdown on dissenters and intercepting a Ryanair 
plane in May. 
"Today terrorist 'sleeper' cells have been exposed, so-called self-defence units," Lukashenko announced at a 
ceremony marking 30 years of independence in post-Soviet Belarus. 
"The goal of these cells is forcible regime change on day X. They themselves so far do not know when this day X 
comes: it is necessary to lead our people to it," Lukashenko said in remarks released by his office. 
He alleged that Germany, the US, Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania were involved in their work. 
"Today we completed a large-scale anti-terror operation," Lukashenko said, adding that Belarusian authorities 
would confront German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Lukashenko also claimed the "sleeper" cells tried to target a Russian naval communication centre near the 
Belarusian town of Vileyka located around 100 kilometres (60 miles) northwest of the capital Minsk and he 
discussed the incident with President Vladimir Putin. 
 "We've discussed this problem in the most serious manner," the Belarus leader said. 
"You understand the result of this discussion. All participants of the terror act -- including those who organised and 
carried it out -- were found and arrested within two days." 
Franak Viacorka, a senior advisor to Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, suggested that 
Lukashenko's latest outburst did not bode well for foreigners and he might be "looking for a pretext to crackdown on 
diplomats". 
"Insane," he tweeted.

The 66-year-old leader also said he ordered officials to seal the country's border with pro-Western Ukraine to 
prevent "a huge amount of arms" coming into Belarus. 
He also alleged that unidentified assailants sought to kill a state television personality, Grigory Azarenok, charging 
that "last night" they wanted to kidnap him and "cut off his tongue." 
Since an election last August, Belarus has been in the grip of a political crisis that erupted after Lukashenko 
secured a sixth term as president. 
The opposition says the election was rigged but authorities imposed an intense crackdown in which several people 
died and thousands were arrested. 
Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet in May to 
intercept a Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania. 
When the plane was forced to land in Minsk, Belarus arrested dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his 
girlfriend on board. 
In June, the West imposed sanctions on key sectors of the Belarus economy, ratcheting up pressure on the regime. 
In response to the latest round of Western sanctions, Minsk said it was suspending its participation in the Eastern 
Partnership, an initiative to boost ties between the EU and its ex-Soviet neighbours. 
Since the outbreak of the crisis, Lukashenko and state TV have made a number of fanciful statements directed at 
the Belarusian opposition and even ally Russia. 
Lukashenko made headlines when he claimed last year that his security forces had intercepted German calls 
showing that Putin foe Alexei Navalny's poisoning with a Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent had been faked. 
Belarusian television broadcast the "intercept" in which a Mike in Warsaw and Nick in Berlin discuss Navalny's 
materials and call Lukashenko a "tough nut to crack". 
Lukashenko also raised eyebrows at the peak of demonstrations last year when he brandished an assault rifle and 
had his teenage son Nikolai appear next to him in a bulletproof vest while also wielding a weapon. 
He accused modern Germany of Nazism on the 80th anniversary of Hitler's invasion of the USSR last month.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC and Wizz Air Holdings PLC on Friday both reported sharp jumps in 
passenger numbers in June, as vaccine programmes and easing restrictions increase confidence among travellers 
at the start of the crucial summer season.
Dublin-based Ryanair carried 5.3 million passengers in June, up from 400,000 in the same month last year. It was a 
sharp increase from May, which saw 1.8 million passengers, and April, with 1.0 million. 
It means Ryanair carried 8.1 million passengers in the first quarter of its financial year ending March 2022, up from 
510,000 in the same period last year. 
Wizz Air also reported a jump in passengers, although not as dramatic as for Ryanair. A total of 1.6 million booked 
passengers flew with Wizz Air in June, up from 502,253 in June 2020 and 832,538 in May 2021. 
But load factors for both airlines remained stubbornly low. Ryanair filled 72% of seats on its flights in June, down 
from 79% in May. Load factors have been around the 70% to 80% range throughout the pandemic, despite massive 
cuts to capacity, down from 97% in previous peak seasons. 
Wizz Air filled 64% of its seats in June, down from 66% the previous month. 
Last month, Ryanair added seats to destinations such as Malta and the Balearic Islands following their addition to 
the UK's travel green list, but urged the government to relax travel rules further. It criticised the current traffic light 
system for UK travellers as being "very confusing" for airlines and customers.
Both airlines also operate routes within the EU, where passengers face fewer restrictions. 
Wizz Air said it opened its sixth Italian base, in Naples, last month.

Ryanair shares were up 1.1% to EUR16.38 in London on Friday morning. Shares in Wizz Air were up 0.9% to

Budget carrier Wizz Air Holdings PLC said its planes were still only two-thirds full as it unveiled its monthly traffic 
numbers.
Load factor was 64%, which was broadly in line with easyJet's performance (per its half-year report). Ryanair's load 
factor in May was an impressive 72%.
Wizz, which says it is Europe's fastest-growing airline, carried 1.56mln passengers in June, for a rolling 12 month 
total of 12.4mln, down 59% year-on-year.
Airlines have been hit hard by the decline of overseas travel caused by the imposition of tough Coronavirus 
(COVID-19) restrictions on international travel.
Wizz focuses on routes to central and eastern Europe rather than the popular Mediterranean holiday destinations.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) saw customers come flooding back in June as Coronavirus (COVID-19) 
vaccination campaigns encouraged countries to loosen travel restrictions.
The airline operated more than 38,000 flights in June with a load factor - a measure of how full the aeroplanes were 
- of 72%.
The total number of passengers carried was 5.3mln, up from 0.4mln a year earlier, when many nations were 
implementing lockdown restrictions that hit the airline industry hard. The number was also a sharp improvement on 
May's 1.8mln passengers, although May's load factor of 79% was higher.
Ryanair said it carried 8.1mln passengers - or "guests", as it insists on calling them - in the second quarter of 2021, 
with a load factor of 73%.
Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) meanwhile said its planes were nearly two thirds full during June.
It carried 1.6mln passengers, up from 500,000 in June last year - the third highest month since the pandemic 
began.
Still, the figure was much lower than the pre-pandemic June 2019 figures when Wizz carried 3.6mln passengers.

Digital travel pass kicks off EU-wide as vacations gain pace

BRUSSELS (AP) — As the European summer vacation season hit its stride Thursday with a new EU-wide travel 
pass in place, the bloc's medical office and a top airline chief issued reassuring messages on traveling, despite the 
threat of the surging delta coronavirus variant.
Many airports saw busy scenes as masses of people sought to escape to the sunny southern European Union 
nations for a beach holiday, with the digital COVID-19 travel certificate a must-have.
The EU Digital Certificate came officially into effect Thursday even though many member states had started 
introducing it over the past month, seeking to boost their summer season by making movement as seamless as 
possible.
“With this, everyone in Europe should be able to travel safely and freely this summer,” said EU Commission 
spokesman Christian Wigand. And in a bloc of 450 million citizens, he said that "already until now, more than two 
hundred million certificates have been generated.”
All warned about the need for extreme vigilance though, after COVID-19 devastated families and economies across 
the 27-nation bloc over the past year.
But Dr. Marco Cavaleri, the European Medicines Agency's head of vaccines strategy, was reassuring Thursday. He 
said that the four approved vaccines in the EU are all “protective against all strains that are circulating in Europe, 
including the delta variant” that emerged in India and is more contagious than others.
“Emerging data from real world evidence are showing that two doses of vaccines are protective against the delta 
variant," he told reporters.
For airline industry leaders with a huge financial stake in this, such as Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary, those are 
sweet words. “A huge amount of both the U.K. population and, increasingly, the European adult population are fully 
vaccinated, therefore they are not at risk,” he said, announcing the opening of more routes south from Brussels 
airports.
Digital travel pass kicks off EU-wide as vacations gain pace
It doesn't mean all tourism transport has gone back to its smooth former self. Take, for example, travel between 
Germany and Portugal.
Germany classifies countries in three risk categories, and Portugal on Tuesday became the only EU member listed 
as a “virus variant area,” Berlin's highest-risk bracket.
Airlines and others are restricted largely in transporting German citizens and residents from countries on that list, 
and those who arrive must spend 14 days in quarantine at home -- a period that can’t be cut short with a negative 
test.
The UK. has been on the list since May 23 because of concerns over the spread of the delta variant. Russia was 
added along with Portugal on Tuesday; other “virus variant areas” include India, Brazil and South Africa. Portugal 
was listed for an initial two-week period, which may be extended.

Britain might need extra precautions to protect against the spread of new variants Covid-19 Boris Johnson said 
today, though he did offer some hope to beleaguered travel firms.
On a visit to Nissan's plant in Sunderland, where the company had just announced a huge investment programme, 
the PM said that people who have had two jabs might not have to quarantine when they return.
Any change in policy on travel would be revealed n the next few days, he said, adding that he was "very confident" 
that it would enable people to go on holiday this summer.
Airlines shares were among the strongest performers on the FTSE 100 on the back of the comments, which 
coincided with the introduction of the EU's digital Covid certificate.
This provides proof of vaccination or of a negative Covid-19 test result and allows free movement across EU 
countries.
European countries, however, are still expecting visitor numbers to be substantially below normal levels due to the 
absence of UK holidaymakers though there were reports about negotiations on a deal with the UK to allow 
vaccinated travellers.
Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece are among the major summer destinations for British sunseekers, but all are on 
the UK's amber list meaning on returning visitors have to self-isolate for ten days and take expensive PCR tests on 
days two and eight.
Johnson offers airlines hope in spite of 'extra precautions' warning
Restrictions for people visiting countries in Europe have also tightened recently due to the spread of the Delta 
variant throughout the UK.
Portugal, for example, now requires arrivals to prove they have had two jabs at least a fortnight earlier or else 
quarantine for 14 days.
Shares in easyJet (LON:EZJ), which has already shifted part of its fleet from the UK to Europe, rose to 2.7% to 
918.8p, while Ryanair and British Airways owner IAG added 2% and 4% respectively.
British Airways has been calling for some movement between the UK and US, which generates a substantial chunk 
of its revenue through business travel.

Fitch Ratings has reduced its airline traffic recovery forecasts in the EMEA region for 2021 and 2022 due to the 
resurgence of Covid-19 infections and new variants of the virus.
The agency adds that the recovery is further constrained by weaker domestic markets and uncoordinated travel 
policy, with lack of reciprocity continuing to impact international travel through until at least the end of the first half of 
next year.
EMEA demand measured in revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs) has been revised to 35% of 2019 levels for 
2021, compared with a previous forecast of 45%.
Fitch's 2022 RPK assumptions have been cut five percentage points to 65% of 2019 levels.
The agency maintains demand will return to 100% of pre-pandemic levels by 2024.
"We expect greater performance divergence among airlines. Those with strong domestic presence, such as Turkish 
Airlines, Aeroflot and Pegasus, are more resilient and will recover faster," adds Fitch.
Subdued business demand and weaker domestic markets will lead to underperformance by network carriers for 
2021, Fitch predicts.
"The pace of low-cost carriers' recovery, such as Ryanair and Wizz Air, will be slower, but will be supported by their 
agile cost base and pent-up demand from leisure travellers," Fitch continues.
A lack of coordination of travel policies in Europe and the Middle East is also expected to continue until the end of 
2021, further disrupting performance.

Ryanair reduces net debt in Q2

Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair reduced its net debt in the first quarter of 2021 of its fiscal year by (EURO)620 million 
($730 million) to (EURO)1.66 billion.
The Group repaid its maturing 1.875% (EURO)850 million unsecured bond, issued in 2014, during the April-June 
quarter. It also issued a (EURO)1.2 billion five-year unsecured bond at a record low coupon of 0.875%.
Ryanair's balance sheet remained strong. At 30 June, the group had (EURO)4.06 billion of cash and 87% of its 
Boeing 737 fleet was unencumbered, representing (EURO)7.4 billion in book value.
Strong operating cash flows and supplier reimbursements drove a (EURO)620 million reduction in net debt to 
(EURO)1.66 billion at 30 June (31 March: (EURO)2.28 billion). This balance sheet strength will enable the Group to 
capitalise on the many growth opportunities that will be available in Europe in the post Covid-19 recovery, Ryanair 
said.
Ryanair Holdings reported a (EURO)273 million first-quarter loss, compared with a (EURO)185 million loss in last 
year's corresponding period.
Revenues totalled (EURO)371 million in the quarter, versus (EURO)125 million a year ago.
Group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary stated: "Covid-19 continued to wreak havoc on our business during 
Q1 with most Easter flights cancelled and a slower than expected easing of EU Govt. travel restrictions into May 
and June. Significant uncertainty around travel green lists (particularly in the UK) and extreme Govt. caution in 
Ireland meant that Q1 bookings were close-in and at low fares".
O'Leary said the 1 July rollout of EU Digital Covid Certificates and the scrapping of quarantine for vaccinated 
arrivals to the UK from mid-July had seen a surge in bookings over recent weeks.
But he admitted that pricing remains below pre Covid-19 levels.
"Based on current (close-in) bookings, we expect traffic to rise from over 5m in June to almost 9m in July, and over 
10m in Aug., as long as there are no further Covid setbacks in Europe. We will continue our load active/yield 
passive strategy as we recover load factors over the course of FY22."    Ryanair expects intra-European capacity to 
be materially lower for the foreseeable future.

"We are encouraged by the high rate of vaccinations across Europe. If, as is presently predicted, most of Europe's 
adult population is fully vaccinated by Sept., then we believe that we can look forward to a strong recovery in air 
travel for the second half of the fiscal year and well into summer 2022- as is presently the case in domestic US air 
travel," said O'Leary.   Ryanair took delivery of its first three 737-8200s from its 210 orderbook in June with Boeing 
and will have a 12-aircraft fleet by the peak of the summer. The carrier hopes to increase its fleet to over 60 in 
advance of summer 2022.

EU court rejects Ryanair state aid challenge

The European Union (EU) General Court has rejected a bid by Ryanair and Laudamotion to annul a (EURO)150 
million ($178 million) subordinated loan convertible into a subsidy provided by the Austrian government for Austrian 
Airlines in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The court agreed with the European Commission's original assessments that the measure constituted state aid 
compatible with the EU internal market.
The Commission approved various aid measures in favour of Lufthansa Group in 2020, including a German 
guarantee of 80% on a loan of (EURO)3 billion granted under a German aid scheme, an Austrian state guarantee of 
90% on a loan of (EURO)300 million granted by a consortium of commercial banks, and individual aid of (EURO)6 
billion granted by Germany in favour of Lufthansa.
The court found that the Commission had sufficiently examined the relationship between the support provided to 
Lufthansa Group, that it had ruled out any risk of overcompensation and that it accurately assessed the 
proportionality of the aid.
It also rejected arguments that the aid discriminated against other airlines operating in Austria.
"In view of the essential role played by AUA for Austria's airline services, the difference in treatment in its favour is 
appropriate for the purpose of remedying the damage suffered by that company as a result of the travel restrictions 
and other containment measures amid the Covid-19 pandemic and does not go beyond what is necessary to 
achieve that objective," the court found.
Ryanair is set to appeal the decision with the EU Court of Justice.
"One of the EU's greatest achievements is the creation of a single market for air transport. The European 
Commission's approval of State aid to Austrian Airlines went against the fundamental principles of EU law and have 
turned back the clock on the process of liberalisation in air transport by rewarding inefficiency and encouraging 
unfair competition," a Ryanair spokesperson stated.

The executive branch of the European Union (EU) has reauthorised a (EURO)3.4 billion ($4 billion) Dutch aid 
measure for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines following the EU general court's ruling to annul the aid pending a 
reassessment of the support's compatibility with the internal market.
First authorised in July last year, the measure consists of a state-guaranteed revolving credit facility and a 
subordinated state loan to KLM to provide urgent liquidity to the company in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In its new decision, the European Commission (EC) confirmed its original assessment and addressed the issues 
identified by the court by providing further information on the functioning of Air France-KLM and on the contractual 
arrangements in place regulating the granting of aid by the Netherlands and France.
The Commission also carried out a thorough assessment of the Dutch and French aid measures and of their 
effective beneficiaries.
On this basis, the Commission concluded that the measure is necessary, appropriate and proportionate to remedy 
a "serious disturbance" in the economy of a member state under the EU's Covid-19 temporary framework.
"Today's decision ensures that the disbursed aid to KLM will not have to be repaid," the EC continued.
This follows a similar reassessment and reapproval of aid measures for TAP Air Portugal earlier this week in 
response to challenges brought forward by Ryanair.
The same court also reversed approval of a (EURO)550 million state-backed loan for German leisure airline Condor 
Flugdienst. That loan will now be restructured as part of its integration into investment fund Attestor.

 On June 29, 2021, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a statement[1] and show-cause order[2] 
tentatively prohibiting the sale of passenger air transportation between the U.S. and Belarus, subject only to 
possible exceptions granted for humanitarian or national security-related travel. 
DOT's action was taken at the request of the U.S. Department of State following Belarus' controversial interference 
with a Ryanair flight, which was forced to divert to Minsk, Belarus, on May 23, 2021. Belarussian authorities 
removed a dissident journalist from the flight, triggering an international outcry. 
DOT plans to effectuate the ban by adding a condition to all existing and future U.S. and foreign air carrier 
certificates, permits and exemptions that would prohibit the sale of passenger flights between the U.S. and Belarus, 
whether or not the flights are operated directly or indirectly, including flights that would operate nonstop from the 
U.S. or via an intermediate point. The ban would cover code share services operated via international points. 
Interested parties have until July 1 to lodge objections on the department's website and searching for Docket ID No. 
DOT-OST-2021-0074. The prohibition is expected to become final shortly after the issuance of a final order.

 Germany's Goethe Institute and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) have been told to suspend their 
Belarus activities. It comes in response to sanctions imposed on Minsk by the EU.On Thursday, Germany's cultural 
Goethe Institute issued a short press statement announcing that it had been asked to cease its Belarus activities. It 
was clear that they were taken by surprise. 
"This is an unprecedented step for the Goethe Institute, which can freely work in its 157 institutes across the world," 
the organization's secretary-general, Johannes Ebert, said on Thursday. He said Minsk's decision was regrettable, 
and expressed hope that the educational and cultural body would soon be able to resume its work. 
Ebert also expressed solidarity with his "colleagues on the ground" and the German Academic Exchange Service 
(DAAD), which has also been asked to suspend its Belarus operations. It has published a similarly worded press 
release. 
German lawmakers lambast Minsk 
Belarus announced the ban on Wednesday evening. A spokesperson with Germany's Foreign Ministry said the 
move will "further isolate Belarus internationally." 
Jürgen Hardt, a foreign policy expert with Germany's Christian Democrats, told DW that "[President Alexander] 
Lukashenko is apparently backed up against the wall." Belarus citizens, he added, are rising up against 
Lukashenko, while the strongman is trying to isolate his country so his people cannot access outside information. 
Hardt said Lukashenko does not want his people learning German and watching German television. This, he said, 
amounts to a bizarre attempt at stabilizing his regime. 
Erhard Grundl, a lawmaker with Germany's Greens, was similarly saddened by Minsk's move. "In times like these, 
projecting soft power through cultural foreign policy carries great importance." Grundl said that the Goethe Institute 
was a "voice for freedom." 
Tit for tat 
The move against both German organizations comes after the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus after 
it forced a Ryanair passenger plane to land in Minsk in late May. Dissident blogger Roman Protasevich was taken 
off the plane and arrested. Belarus has also left the EU's Eastern Partnership initiative. 
Germany's DAAD, which has had an office in the Belarusian capital since 2003, provides information to locals about 
studying and researching in Germany. The forced closure means six DAAD editors, who currently work at 
Belarusian universities, will have to leave the country. 
Virtual events continue 
Belarus tells Germany 's Goethe Institute, DAAD to shut down
The Goethe Institute set up shop in Minsk in 1993. It runs a library, a reading room in Wizebsk, and it operates a 
bus delivering German-language media and information about the country to Belarusians across the country. 
The organizations employs dozens of people, most of them locals. German language classes are very popular, 
along with cultural events such as lectures, readings and film screenings. But the coronavirus pandemic has meant 
that all of these events have been online only. 
A talk format hosted by the Goethe Institute on Zoom centers around the theme of "literature in difficult times," 
featuring novelists and poets from Belarus and Hong Kong, discussing their creative processes. Belarus and Hong 
Kong, after all, have experienced large anti-government protests lately. Belarusian novelist Viktor Martinowitsch, 
whose recent work Revolution is popular with the opposition, is part of the line-up. 
It is not clear at this stage how soon the Goethe Institute and German Academic Exchange Service will have to 
close down their Belarus offices, or what will come next. Both organizations may intensify their work in neighboring 
Russia and Ukraine, hoping to service Belarus from abroad. A Goethe Institute spokesperson told DW "virtual 
language courses will remain available to everyone, regardless of their location."

 For airline industry leaders with a huge financial stake in this, such as Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, those are 
sweet words. 'A huge amount of both the U.K. population and, increasingly, the European adult population are fully 
vaccinated, therefore they are not at risk,' he said, announcing the opening of more routes south from Brussels 
airports. (Ad) While inflation is about to hit all time highs. Many investors are thinking of putting their money into 
gold. But is that the best play? Maybe not, because gold prices are also at an all time high. ($2,000/oz) 
 It doesn't mean all tourism transport has gone back to its smooth former self. Take, for example, travel between 
Germany and Portugal.  
Digital travel pass kicks off EU-wide as vacations gain pace
 Germany classifies countries in three risk categories, and Portugal on Tuesday became the only EU member listed 
as a 'virus variant area,' Berlin's highest-risk bracket. 
 Airlines and others are restricted largely in transporting German citizens and residents from countries on that list, 
and those who arrive must spend 14 days in quarantine at home -- a period that can't be cut short with a negative 
test. 
 The UK. has been on the list since May 23 because of concerns over the spread of the delta variant. Russia was 
added along with Portugal on Tuesday; other 'virus variant areas' include India, Brazil and South Africa. Portugal 
was listed for an initial two-week period, which may be extended.

7 Cyclical Stocks That Can Help You Play Defense [2] A cyclical stock is one that produces returns that are 
influenced by macroeconomic or systematic changes in the broader economy. In strong economic times, these 
stocks show generally strong growth because they are influenced by discretionary consumer spending. Of course, 
that means the opposite is true as well. When the economy is weak, these stocks may pull back further than other 
stocks. 
 Cyclical stocks cover many sectors, but travel and entertainment stocks come to mind. Airlines, hotels, and 
restaurants are all examples of cyclical sectors that do well during times of economic growth but are among the first 
to pull back in recessionary times. 
 Why do cyclical stocks deserve a place in an investor's portfolio? Believe it or not, it's for the relative predictability 
that they provide. Investors may enjoy speculating in growth stocks, but these are prone to bubbles. This isn't to say 
that cyclical stocks are not volatile, but they offer price movement that is a bit more predictable. 
 In this special presentation, we're looking at cyclical stocks that are looking strong as we come out of the 
pandemic. And some of these stocks held up well during the pandemic which means they're starting from a 
stronger base.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
 Honest Mistakes or Deliberate Disinformation? 
 Satire and humour have an obvious place in democratic discourse. The Russian satirical website Panorama has 
since 2017 successfully poked fun at several features of Russian and international politics. But occasionally, the 
authorities have failed to get the joke and taken the satire at face value. 
Satire site Panorama was founded in 2017, but panorama.pub tells of an intriguing history that goes back much 
further. It calls itself 'the oldest Soviet and Russian news agency', says it was founded in 1822, nationalised by the 
Bolsheviks after the Russian revolution, and worked illegally all the way through to 1988. 
On its site, it pledges to stay loyal to its 200-year-old traditions, and report on events in Russia and around the 
world objectively and accurately. 
True to form, the history is all a spoof. All we know of Panorama's past is that it was launched four years ago by two 
individuals who go by the aliases Boris Gontermakher and Vitaly Mann. In an interview in 2019 they claimed to 
have seven to ten freelance writers. 
Panorama has spoofed its way to exceptional success. Its website attracts up to 100,000 visits a day, and it also 
runs popular social media accounts - over 60,000 subscriberson Twitter[2]and over 25,000 followerson Telegram[3]. 
One recent articleclaims[4]the prominent Belarusian opposition politician, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, signed a 
decree selling the Belarusian airline Belavia to Ryanair for the symbolic price of 1 euro as a goodwill gesture, 
following the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Belarus this May. 
Kremlin Not Getting The Joke
It alsoreports[5]the news that the electric car company Tesla had to stop production and send thousands of workers 
on unpaid leave after Belarus stopped supplying it with components. 
In 2018, the Russian senator Igor Morozov, interviewed on the radio station Vesti FM,quoted[6]a Panorama news 
story that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, had fired 29 regional governors for laziness. Morozov said this zero-
tolerance policy towards bad behaviour in state officials could be a good example for Russia to follow. 
 Satire Taken at Face Value 
 This is not the only time a Panorama story has migrated into the mainstream news. The site's satirical articles have 
been repeatedly taken at face value by Russian state news agencies and high-ranking officials, who rapidly become 
objects of ridicule as soon as it becomes apparent they've been taken in by stories that are pure fantasy. 
On its logo Panorama clearly states it's a 'satirical outlet', and it also places warnings under its stories that they're a 
'grotesque parody of reality'. Despite this, its material has been reposted dozens of times by state media, and its 
invented 'facts' are presented as the truth by high-ranking Russian officials. 
In September 2018, Zvezda, a nationwide, state-owned TV network run by the Ministry of Defence, also fell for one 
of Panorama's imaginative pranks. Itreposted[7]the fake story of a Russian schoolteacher who taught kids the 
biographies of local crime bosses. 
Russia Today has also fallen for Panorama's made-up stories. On its Telegram channel itcarried[8]the news that a 
former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory, Grigory Rodchenkov, had attempted suicide. This 'news' was 
picked up by dozens of media outlets and discussed on the Rossiya 1 political talk show. 
The high-profile Russian journalist and pro-Kremlin propagandist, Vladimir Solovyov, has alsotwice[9]been fooled 
by Panorama's satire. The first story concerned Chinese and Americans fighting in Paris over the Soviet Union's 
role in World War Two. The second was about the Yeltsin Centre helping protesters in Yekaterinburg. Solovyov 
then became involved in a heated altercation on Twitter, accusing the humour site of spreading fake news. 
Panorama's influence has extended beyond Russia. In 2018, the Belarussian ONT TV channel 
proudlyannounced[10]on its Telegram channel that President Alyaksandr Lukashenka had been nominated for a 
Nobel prize by a Belarusian scientist, who it transpired was entirely fictitious and invented by Panorama. 
 A Polish Joke 
 On 30 July 2020, Panoramareported[11]that the Polish President, Andrzej Duda, had said the Polish army was 
ready to take over the Belarusian cities of Brest and Hrodna, as well as the rest of western Belarus. According to 
Duda's fictitious statement, Poland was preparing to protect areas that had once been part of the Polish 
Commonwealth. 
Following presidential elections in Belarus in August 2020, a wave of anti-government protests broke out across the 
country. Panorama's fantasy statement from the Polish President was seized on by pro-Kremlin media and woven 
into repeated disinformation narratives about Polish imperial aspirations and the West's aggressive plans for 
Belarus. 
EUvsDisinfo has documentedover 40 disinformation cases[12], warning of aggressive Polish intentions to create a 
so-calledFourth Rzeczpospolita[13](Polish Commonwealth),to take over Minsk[14], and ultimatelyto colonise the 
whole of Belarus, along with Ukraine[15]. 
President Duda's fictional statement took on a life of its own over the days and weeks to come. It waspicked 
up[16]by 
Nezavisimaya 
Gazeta, 
andZvezda 
Weekly[17],Fond 
Strategicheskoy 
Kremlin Not Getting The Joke
Kultury[18],Eurasia.expert[19]followed, along with other pro-Kremlin websites. They either quoted Nezavisimaya 
Gazeta, or left out the source of the statement altogether. Duda's 'statement' also appeared inTeleskop[20], which 
alleged 'Anglo-Saxons controlled Poland'. 
 Fool Me Twice 
 Over time, journalists and officials have learnt from other people's mistakes - and their own - and now know what 
Panorama is, and what it isn't. It's entirely possible the pro-Kremlin disinformation network has also learnt from the 
Panorama experience that satire has its uses, by presenting convenient fakes as real news at the right time. 
Panorama can be seen as something post-ironic, when something absurd is taken seriously. Many people who 
believe pro-Kremlin propaganda will have taken President Duda's statement at face value, especially as it appeared 
on websites that didn't have that helpful 'satirical outlet' printed on their logos, as Panorama does. 
EUvsDisinfo includes several cases where Russian state media have used images fromvideo games[21]as 'proof' 
of military action inSyria[22]and theSouth Caucasus[23]. Are the examples above honest mistakes or deliberate 
attempts to fool the audience? There are more than12,000 cases of disinformation[24]in the EUvsDisinfo database 
on disinformation. Facts are peripheral in the pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts, and checking a 'good story' is 
irrelevant.

Belarus tells Germany 's Goethe Institute, DAAD to shut down
Belarus tells Germany's Goethe Institute, DAAD to shut down

Jul 01, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 Germany's Goethe Institute and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) have been told to suspend their 
Belarus activities. It comes in response to sanctions imposed on Minsk by the EU.On Thursday, Germany's cultural 
Goethe Institute issued a short press statement announcing that it had been asked to cease its Belarus activities. It 
was clear that they were taken by surprise. 
"This is an unprecedented step for the Goethe Institute, which can freely work in its 157 institutes across the world," 
the organization's secretary-general, Johannes Ebert, said on Thursday. He said Minsk's decision was regrettable, 
and expressed hope that the educational and cultural body would soon be able to resume its work. 
Ebert also expressed solidarity with his "colleagues on the ground" and the German Academic Exchange Service 
(DAAD), which has also been asked to suspend its Belarus operations. It has published a similarly worded press 
release. 
German lawmakers lambast Minsk 
Belarus announced the ban on Wednesday evening. A spokesperson with Germany's Foreign Ministry said the 
move will "further isolate Belarus internationally." 
Jürgen Hardt, a foreign policy expert with Germany's Christian Democrats, told DW that "[President Alexander] 
Lukashenko is apparently backed up against the wall." Belarus citizens, he added, are rising up against 
Lukashenko, while the strongman is trying to isolate his country so his people cannot access outside information. 
Hardt said Lukashenko does not want his people learning German and watching German television. This, he said, 
amounts to a bizarre attempt at stabilizing his regime. 
Erhard Grundl, a lawmaker with Germany's Greens, was similarly saddened by Minsk's move. "In times like these, 
projecting soft power through cultural foreign policy carries great importance." Grundl said that the Goethe Institute 
was a "voice for freedom." 
Tit for tat 
The move against both German organizations comes after the European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus after 
it forced a Ryanair passenger plane to land in Minsk in late May. Dissident blogger Roman Protasevich was taken 
off the plane and arrested. Belarus has also left the EU's Eastern Partnership initiative. 
Germany's DAAD, which has had an office in the Belarusian capital since 2003, provides information to locals about 
studying and researching in Germany. The forced closure means six DAAD editors, who currently work at 
Belarusian universities, will have to leave the country. 
Virtual events continue 
Belarus tells Germany 's Goethe Institute, DAAD to shut down
The Goethe Institute set up shop in Minsk in 1993. It runs a library, a reading room in Wizebsk, and it operates a 
bus delivering German-language media and information about the country to Belarusians across the country. 
The organizations employs dozens of people, most of them locals. German language classes are very popular, 
along with cultural events such as lectures, readings and film screenings. But the coronavirus pandemic has meant 
that all of these events have been online only. 
A talk format hosted by the Goethe Institute on Zoom centers around the theme of "literature in difficult times," 
featuring novelists and poets from Belarus and Hong Kong, discussing their creative processes. Belarus and Hong 
Kong, after all, have experienced large anti-government protests lately. Belarusian novelist Viktor Martinowitsch, 
whose recent work Revolution is popular with the opposition, is part of the line-up. 
It is not clear at this stage how soon the Goethe Institute and German Academic Exchange Service will have to 
close down their Belarus offices, or what will come next. Both organizations may intensify their work in neighboring 
Russia and Ukraine, hoping to service Belarus from abroad. A Goethe Institute spokesperson told DW "virtual 
language courses will remain available to everyone, regardless of their location."

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could cause the global economy to lose over US$4 trillion in gross domestic 
product (GDP) due to the collapse of international tourism, according to a report from the United Nations.
Published on Wednesday, the report from the UN's Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said the 
estimated loss was caused by the pandemic's direct impact on tourism as well as ripple effects on sectors closely 
linked to it.
READ: England drops quarantine for senior executives "bringing significant economic benefit" to UK
Around US$2.4 trillion was lost from international tourism and related sectors in 2020 alone as a result of the "steep 
drop in international tourist arrivals", UNCTAD said, adding that a similar loss may occur this year and the tourism 
sector's recovery will "largely depend on the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines globally".
While a rebound in international tourism is expected in the second half of 2021, UNCTAD estimated a loss to world 
GDP of between US$1.7-US$2.4 trillion for the year compared to 2019 levels.
Countries predicted to be most impacted by the decline in tourism include Turkey, which relies on tourism for 5% of 
its GDP and suffered a 69% decline in tourists in 2020, costing the country around US$33bn.
Other nations forecast to suffer sharp shocks from the decline in tourism included Ecuador, South Africa and 
Ireland, while the UK was expected to suffer a 3.2% hit to GDP under the report's worst-case scenario.
COVID-19 could cost world economy trillions in lost tourism revenue, UN report says
UNCTAD said losses suffered during the last 12 months had been "worse than previously expected", with the 
conference estimating in July 2020 that a four-to-12 month standstill of international tourism would cost the global 
economy between US$1.2-US$3.3 trillion.
It added that international tourist levels are not expected to return to pre-COVID levels until 2023 or later.
The report, particularly the prediction that recovery may take another 2 years, is likely to make for grim reading 
among London-listed travel firms and carriers such as TUI AG (LON:TUI), Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA), 
easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ), Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) and On The Beach PLC (LON:OTB), all of which saw 
demand crater during the peak of the pandemic with only a muted rebound as travel restrictions are slowly eased.
Shares in TUI were up 0.4% at 366.3p in late morning trading on Wednesday, while Ryanair rose 1.4% to 
(EURO)15.79, easyJet climbed 1% to 901.4p, Wizz Air ascended 1.2% to 4,654p and On The Beach inched up 
0.3% to 326p.

United Airlines has placed an order for 270 jets, the biggest in the airline's history, in a bet on a resurgence of 
premium travel after the pandemic. The Chicago-based company said yesterday it was ordering 200 Boeing 737 
Maxes and 70 Airbus A321neos and expected to create 25,000 jobs by 2026 linked to the order.
At the same time, United is reconfiguring its existing fleet with more first-class and premium economy seats and 
improved in-seat entertainment and overhead storage.
United's plans are the latest signs of divergence between US and European airlines' strategies.
As the pandemic ebbs in the US, more US carriers are placing orders. Southwest said in March it would take 100 
Boeing 737 Maxes, while Delta ordered another 25 Airbus A321neos in April. American Airlines had largely 
completed updating its fleet before the pandemic hit, leaving the airline with a higher debt load than peers.
On the other side of the Atlantic, few carriers committed to significant new aircraft orders during the pandemic as 
they instead looked to conserve cash during the disruption.
However, low-cost carrier Ryanair bucked the European trend in December with an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max 
jets with a list price of $22bn.
United we expand Order for 270 jets is largest in carrier's history as pandemic ebbs in US
Analysts at the time suggested that the airline would have got a "really screaming good deal", underlining the 
benefits of having the cash for aircraft purchases in the current climate. Combined with its current orders,
United will add more than 500 new narrow-body jets to its fleet between 2022 and 2024, as it retires about 300 
planes, the bulk of them regional jets.
The number of United seats on US domestic flights will rise 30 per cent over the next five years, while the number 
of premium seats will rise 75 per cent compared with 2019 levels.
United's shares fell 2.6 per cent on Monday on concerns about how the order would affect its financial position. The 
list price of the planes is more than $30bn, but typically airlines pay about half the list price.
"It will be up to the company to articulate ... how new orders change the investment trajectory while also providing 
room for debt reduction," said Evercore ISI analyst Duane Pfennigwerth. "What is the path back to meaningful free 
cash flow, which will enable balance sheet repair for United?"
The airline has about $33bn in longterm debt. Like competitors, United raised cash from investors and the US 
government to survive the Covid-19 crisis.

Jun 30, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The coronavirus pandemic, which was aptly described in April 2020 as the 'the worst financial crisis in aviation 
history" by United Airlines' UAL[1] former CEO Oscar Munoz, caused an untold misery to airlines last year. With air-
travel demand touching a nadir, most airline companies incurred losses in each of the four quarters of 2020. 
Reflecting the hardships, the Zacks Airline [2]industry declined 26.4% last year. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
However, the industry participants' fortunes changed with the advent of 2021. Wide-spread vaccinations instilled 
confidence in people to fly once again without the fear of contracting the infection from a fellow-traveler. As a result 
of the uptick in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure), carriers including Delta Air Lines DAL[3], Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[4] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] announced plans to add/resume operations on several routes to meet the 
demand surge. Also, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] is seeing a swell in passenger count despite the 
coronavirus-led travel restrictions, per a Reuters report[7]. 
Moreover, in the United States, the Transportation Security Administration screened more than two million people in 
not less than 10 days during June (considering the data until Jun 29). In fact, TSA screened 2,167,380 people last 
Sunday [8]i.e. Jun 27, 2021. This was the highest reading taken since Mar 5, 2020. Betterment of the scenario is 
well-reflected in the Zacks Airline industry's growth of 6.9% year to date. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Air Traffic Likely to Continue Northward Movement in 2H While the 
weakness pertaining to business travel is unlikely to disappear soon, overall air-travel demand is likely to continue 
improving in the second half of 2021, driven by leisure travel. The fact that the expectation of a recovery is not only 
restricted to the United States is clear from the fact the European carrier Ryanair's recent addition of 200,000 seats 
on flights from the United Kingdom to Malta and the Balearics (Ibiza and Palma) for July, August and September. 
This follows the U.K. government's decision to include these islands on the green list for travel that allows flyers to 
visit these sites without having to quarantine (provided they are declared COVID negative) themselves on their 
return. The relaxation is effective today. 
Even in Latin America, air-travel demand is northbound on the back of ramped-up vaccination programs. This is 
evident from the fact that consolidated traffic at Azul AZUL[9] improved 12.4% in May from the April tally. At another 
Latin American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[10], May traffic surged 65% month over month. 
3 Airline Stocks to Watch in 2H as Air-Travel Scene Brightens
Riding on such an improved scenario, Gol's outlook for the second half of 2021 seems rosy. The carrier, currently 
carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), expects net operating revenues for the latter half to be approximately R$6 billion, 
much higher than the second-quarter estimate of roughly R$1 billion. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[11]. 
Moreover, alike the first half of the year, the focus on the cargo segment should continue to serve airlines well in the 
latter half of the year too. 
The above write-up clearly suggests that things are on the mend as far as airlines are concerned and the second 
half of the year should see this momentum to continue on the back of improvements witnessed in first half of the 
year. We therefore highlighted three airline stocks, each presently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, that investors should 
keep tabs on. Our Choices United Airlines: In response to a better air-travel demand, United Airlines plans to add in 
excess of 400 daily flights to its July schedule. The airline expects to operate 80% of its pre-pandemic U.S. 
schedule in the month as summer travel bookings soar 214% from the 2020 levels. The company's cost-control 
initiatives are supporting its bottom line. Owing to an improved air-travel demand scenario, the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for 2021 is currently pegged at a loss of $14.15 per share, narrower than the loss of $14.26 estimated for 
the stock 60 days ago. 
Southwest Airlines LUV[12]: Restoration of leisure-travel demand is a huge plus for this Dallas-based carrier. To 
meet the anticipated demand upturn in the latter half of the year, Southwest Airlines recently announced a pay hike 
for its hourly employees. The impending increment, which will be effective Aug 1, is aimed at retaining its existing 
employees as well as attracting new personnel. 
Owing to bloated bookings, aided by an upswing in air-travel demand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2021 is 
currently pegged at a loss of $1.29 per share, narrower than the loss of $1.47 estimated for the stock 60 days ago. 
Alaska Air Group ALK[13]: With air-travel demand rising, Alaska Airlines is constantly looking to add routes and 
widen its network to meet the anticipated demand swell. This upbeat scenario led to a healthy cash flow from the 
company's operations. 
Boosted by higher bookings, attributable to a spike in air-travel demand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2021 
currently stands at a loss of $2.50 per share, narrower than the loss of $2.86 expected for the stock in the past 60 
days. 
Notably, shares of United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air have rallied 20.5%, 13.5% and 15.6%, 
respectively, so far this year. Take a look ---

Credit Suisse still likes airlines EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ), Ryanair (LON:RYA) and Wizz Air (LON:WIZZ) for their 
recovery potential even though it increased its loss estimates for the trio in the current year.
EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) in particular might be the surprise package for recovery in 2002 if European progress on 
vaccinations continues at its current pace, according to transport analysts at the broker.
Credit Suisse has raised its loss estimates for this year £1.17bn from £900mln to reflect the ongoing UK travel 
uncertainty but numbers for beyond 2022 are unchanged, as is its 'outperform' rating.
All eyes are on easyJet's £2bn debt but meaningful intra-EU bookings can have a significant impact on reducing 
this, says the broker.
EZJ revenues were £2.3bn in the fourth quarter of 2019, around half of which came from non-UK routes.
Up to two-thirds of its intra-EU schedule will operate this fourth quarter with scope to generate several hundred 
million pounds from forward bookings.
Lease liabilities also represent half of the net debt and with 35% of leased aircraft under negotiation in a very soft 
market, this offers potential for significant net debt reduction.
The outlook for short-haul is also 'compelling' with a rebound in demand on top of reduced capacity potentially 
sending easyJet's profit per seat back to its previous record levels.
These three things might about EZJ's leverage could surprise the market positively, the broker concludes.

U.S. moves to restrict travel to Belarus over Ryanair diversion
U.S. moves to restrict travel to Belarus over Ryanair diversion

 The Department of Transportation issued an order[1] Tuesday proposing restrictions on the sale of passenger 
airline tickets between the U.S. and Belarus.  
Why it matters: The move follows Belarus' decision last month to divert a commercial Ryanair flight[2] in order to 
detain journalist and opposition leader Raman Pratasevich and Sofiya Sapega, another journalist. In the aftermath 
of the incident President Biden said[3] his administration was developing "appropriate options" to hold Belarus 
accountable, but the U.S. didn't immediately impose restrictions. Belarus' actions were described as a "hijacking" by 
some European leaders and condemned[4] by the European Council. What they're saying: "DOT's order is 
premised on the Department of State's determination that, in light of the diversion of Ryanair flight 4978, it is in the 
foreign policy interests of the United States to limit transportation between the United States and Belarus," the 
department said in a statement Tuesday. "The prohibition would provide the ability for the U.S. Government to 
make case-by-case exceptions for any transportation deemed to be in the national interest of the United States, 
including on humanitarian or national security grounds," it added. The prohibition would also apply to "interline" air 
travel in which tickets are booked through one airline that contain flights operated by multiple airlines, according to 
the Transportation Department. The order is open for public comment until Thursday. Yes, but: The decision to 
restrict airline ticket sales is "mostly symbolic" since "relatively few tickets are purchased for travel to Belarus from 
U.S.-based travel services," Reuters[5] notes.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States on Tuesday proposed sharp restrictions on travel between the U.S. and 
Belarus, the latest fallout from the forced landing of a passenger jet to arrest a dissident Belarussian journalist.
The Transportation Department said the order would bar airlines from selling tickets for travel between the two 
countries, with possible exceptions for humanitarian or national security reasons.
There are no direct passenger flights between the U.S. and Belarus.
The move follows the May 23 diversion of a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, so authorities could 
arrest journalist Raman Pratasevich after the plane landed in Minsk. Pratasevich faces a possible 15-year prison 
term. He and his girlfriend were recently moved from jail to house arrest.
President Joe Biden has condemned the forced diversion of the jet by Belarus so it could arrest a dissident 
journalist as an “outrageous incident” and has joined calls for an international investigation.
Last week the European Union imposed new economic sanctions to register concern over the incident. Belarus 
responded Monday by stopping cooperation against illegal migration and banning EU officials.

 On 23 May 2021 President Lukashenko ordered the Ryanair plane, flying from Athens to Vilnius, capital of 
Lithuania, carrying his Nazi-schooled threatening opponent and activist Protasevich and his girlfriend, to be diverted 
to Minsk. He did so after having received a message of a bomb threat on board the plane from the Swiss e-mail 
provider Proton Mail. Proton later said the message was sent after the plane was already diverted. Whom to 
believe? If Proton Mail is right, why then send a message in the first place? Neutral Switzerland is again caught red-
handed - and red-faced. 
 The opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, were immediately arrested upon 
landing in Minsk and are now jailed, awaiting judgment and/or extradition to Ukraine, where Protasevich is accused 
of having participated fighting in Kiev's neo-Nazi battalion against Donbass. 
 As reported by RT, authorities of the self-proclaimed Lugansk Republic (LNR) have accused Roman Protasevich of 
being part of the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion. The LNR is an unrecognized state located in Ukraine and has existed 
since the 2014 western prompted 'civil war' in Donbass, when separatists unilaterally declared independence from 
Kiev. The Azov Battalion is an ultra-right-wing military unit now incorporated into the National Guard of Kiev-
Ukraine. 
 RT states that Azov fought during the height of the Donbass war, first seeing action at the Battle of Mariupol. The 
group is heavily linked to neo-Nazi ideology, with the regiment's logo featuring the Wolfsangel, a symbol of many 
divisions of the Nazi German Army during World War II. Joining the Azov Battalion is illegal in Donbass, as well as 
in Belarus. 
 An LNR Prosecutor says there is evidence that Protasevich has fought in the Donbass war on the side of Kiev. See 
here[1]. 
 Given the tense circumstances — call them western aggressions — after President Lukashenko's landslide 
reelection, there may be good justification for Lukashenko to arrest his archenemy, Protasevich, whose 
unpredictability - and especially, his most likely following orders from the west, predominantly the US and its EU 
'compradores' - might be a threat to Lukashenko's life. 
 The arrest of Protasevich is the official reason for predominantly the US, followed by the vassalic Europeans, to 
initiate a series of 'sanctions' against the Lukashenko Government and Belarus. Sanctions include travel bans for 
prominent people, the freezing of Belarusian state assets and Belarusian private assets in the US and EU and in 
The West's Audacity of Sanctioning: The Latest Case is Belarus
the west in general. For those who don't know, this is only possible because the western dollar-based economy is 
totally controlled by US/Wall Street banks. Any western currency transaction flows automatically through a US bank 
- mostly through the SWIFT system - thus, can be interrupted and confiscated at any time by Washington orders. 
 The point is, the west - again especially the US - wants to get rid of Lukashenko, a close Kremlin ally. They want to 
replace Lukashenko by a friend of the west, so as to be free to advance with NATO into Belarus, a step closer to 
Moscow's doorstep. Belarus is extremely important for Russia, not only as buffer zone, but more so because of 
Russia's two key military bases in Belarus. The importance of Belarus to Russia is about equivalent to the 
importance of Crimea and particularly Sebastopol for Moscow. 
 NATO aggression — that's the key reason. The west couldn't care less about human rights, the reason they bring 
forward for the sanctions. The west has never cared - and under the current constellation will never care - for 
human rights. In fact, the west is the world's biggest and most brutal offender of both civil and human rights. And 
this doesn't even take into account the western instigated worldwide covid drama - decimating world population, as 
well as the world economy. 
 Just imagine the reverse, a ferocious eastern enemy of the Biden Administration, on a plane approaching the US, 
but destined to a neighboring country, say Nicaragua or Mexico, or, god-forbid, Cuba - with threats to harm 
President Biden or people of his entourage. The US would just let it go? I don't think so. If Washington had a 
chance to bring the threatening eastern enemy onto US soil and arrest him, they would do so. 
 Would the east, and I mean the entire eastern alliance of the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization) - about 
the equivalent of the western alliance - start sanctioning the US, foremost the US President and his close support 
group; the European Union, putting up travel bans for political leaders and high officials of the US/EU 
Administrations - plus a myriad of economic sanctions; i.e., interrupting the eastern supply chain for western 
consumer goods, but foremost, for eastern (mostly Chinese) produced pharmaceuticals on which the west heavily 
depends? 
 Have eastern countries ever sanctioned the west? Never, as far as my history books say, and they were all edited 
and printed in the west. It's not part of the eastern cultural and ethical standards punishing other countries - even 
their western self-proclaimed enemies - to punish them for their autonomous and sovereign independent behavior. 
China, Russia, Syria, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea - to name just a few - might not like what is done to them 
by the west, but 'sanctioning' an autonomous sovereign nation, for example, by cutting off their energy supply is not 
in the cards for the east. 
 Is it surprising that the east is increasingly going its own way - a way offering incorporation for those who want a 
peaceful social and economic development, but no longer a way of dependence and obedience to Washington and 
western puppets? Sorry to call the European 'puppets' of the Washington empire. They may be the 'parents' - the 
parent empire - of today's US-empire, but that they follow in their offspring's criminal footstep is not a feast of honor, 
or of inspiring respect. 
 Back to Belarus. Lukashenko has done what he had to do to protect the integrity of his country and government - 
and viewing ahead with a looking glass - to protect their ally Russia from another NATO step closer to Moscow. And 
so did President Putin, when he had his arch-enemy and traitor, Alexei Navalny, arrested; Navalny, who claimed 
the nonsensical, having been poisoned by Russia - when the very Russian authorities let him go to the west, Berlin 
as it were, to receive medical treatment against his 'poison'. A huge western anti-Russia propaganda ensued. 
 Did Russia sanction Germany, the EU or the US for these abject lies? 
 There seems to be no limit - on any subject, on any issue - to western lies and manipulation of the truth. At least 
until now. This may change as more people are waking up, seeing ever clearer through the thinning sham of veil. It 
also seems that the west doesn't realize that their very empire is committing suicide by this eternal regime of 
'sanctioning' whomever doesn't dance according to their flute. Former or potential allies are driven away into the 
more peaceful camp of eastern respect for the sovereignty of their allies. The post The West's Audacity of 
Sanctioning: The Latest Case is Belarus[2] first appeared on Dissident Voice[3].

a news conference at the National Press Center of Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Minsk, Belarus. The dissident 
Belarusian journalist and his Russian girlfriend who were arrested after their airline flight was diverted to Minsk last 
month have been moved from jail to house arrest. Raman Pratasevich, who ran a messaging app channel that was 
widely used in last year's massive protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, and his Russian girlfriend

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States on Tuesday proposed sharp restrictions on travel between the U.S. and 
Belarus, the latest fallout from the forced landing of a passenger jet to arrest a dissident Belarussian journalist. 
 The Transportation Department said the order would bar airlines from selling tickets for travel between the two 
countries, with possible exceptions for humanitarian or national security reasons. 
 There are no direct passenger flights between the U.S. and Belarus.  
 The move follows the May 23 diversion of a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, so authorities could 
arrest journalist Raman Pratasevich after the plane landed in Minsk. Pratasevich faces a possible 15-year prison 
term. He and his girlfriend were recently moved from jail to house arrest. 
 President Joe Biden has condemned the forced diversion of the jet by Belarus so it could arrest a dissident 
journalist as an 'outrageous incident' and has joined calls for an international investigation. 
 Last week the European Union imposed new economic sanctions to register concern over the incident. Belarus 
responded Monday by stopping cooperation against illegal migration and banning EU officials.

7 Stocks That Could Benefit From a Capital Gains Tax Hike[2] One thing every investor needs to learn is the effect 
of capital gains on their investments. Every time an investor sells a stock that has appreciated in value, that capital 
gain is subject to being taxed. Stocks that are held for less than a year pay a short-term capital gains tax rate. 
Stocks that are held for over a year pay a long-term capital gains tax rate. 
 In general, a capital gains tax hike is a bearish indicator for stocks. However, there are a couple of strategies that 
can help investors avoid some of the tax hit. One strategy is to keep your investments in an individual retirement 
US proposes to ban air travel between US and Belarus
account (IRA) or 401(k). However many higher-income earners want to have more access to the funds in their 
brokerage accounts. 
 A sound strategy for these investors involves buying dividend stocks. Dividend income is also taxed (unless it is 
reinvested), but typically when the capital gains tax rate is raised, the dividend income rate stays the same. This 
makes dividend stocks more attractive. 
 Investing in dividend stocks is never a bad idea, but at times when the capital gains tax rate is favorable, growth 
stocks provide a better reward for investor capital. But when long-term capital gains tax rates go up, those gains 
can get expensive. 
 In this special presentation, we'll give you seven stocks that have a nice dividend yield and a strong story to go 
along with them.

Jun 29, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Gary Kelly, who has been serving Southwest Airlines LUV[1] as its CEO since 2004, announced 
that he will relinquish his post in early 2022. This Dallas-based carrier was also in news when it reportedly[2] 
decided to increase the minimum remuneration of its nearly 7,000 employees to $15 an hour. The strategic move is 
aimed at retaining/attracting workers as air-travel demand picks up. 
Notably, the raises, which will be effective Aug 1, will be in the 7-11% range for the new hirees. Moreover, this pay-
hike plan will cover the call center operators, customer service agents, skycaps and others. However, the company 
will have to negotiate with labor unions before the increased wage materializes for some labor groups. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] announced the addition of 200,000 seats on flights from the United 
Kingdom to Malta and the Balearics (Ibiza and Palma) for July, August and September. This follows the U.K. 
government's decision to include these islands on the green list for travel, which allows people to visit these places 
without having to quarantine (provided their COVID-19 test results are negative) themselves on their return. The 
relaxation is set to be implemented on Jun 30. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Southwest 
Airlines picked company veteran Robert Jordan to succeed Gary Kelly as its new CEO, once the latter steps down 
in February 2022. Kelly, however, plans to serve as the company's executive chairman through 2026. Notably, 
Jordan joined the carrier in 1988 and currently serves as its executive vice president, corporate services. He played 
a crucial role in several transformational measures taken by the company[4]. 
Southwest Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
2. Delta Air Lines DAL[6] expanded its codeshare agreement with Kenya Airways, thereby boosting connectivity 
between the United States and Africa. The agreement builds on the two airlines' existing codeshare network to offer 
smooth travel to 39 cities across Africa, the United States and Canada. As part of this extended deal, customers 
can have access to flights operated by Kenya Airways on the routes to Monrovia, Liberia and Freetown in Sierra 
Leone where Delta shared its code[7]. 
Notably, Delta is constantly looking to restore its international network. To this end, this Atlanta, GA-based carrier 
announced plans to resume flights to South Africa shortly, as was mentioned in the previous week's write-up[8].

3. With the onset of the summer travel period, Ryanair is seeing a swell in passenger numbers despite coronavirus-
led travel restrictions, per a Reuters report[9]. In an interview with Reuters, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary stated 
that bookings witnessed significant recovery over the last eight weeks with increased number of the same to 
Portugal and other popular destinations from Germany, Scandinavia and the Benelux countries. Per the report, 
O'Leary said, "Traffic is mushrooming and a lot of that folk are families going on summer holidays to the beaches of 
Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy." He further added that the airline expected to fly 80-100 million passengers in 
fiscal 2022. 
4. Spirit Airlines SAVE[10] started operating non-stop flights to Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport Jun 24 
onward. The inaugural celebrations, however, brought more good news to fliers. Management of this Miramar, FL-
based ultra low-cost carrier announced that additional non-stop flights to this favorite tourist spot in the state of 
Wisconsin will be launched later this year. On materialization, the above expansion will nearly triple Spirit Airlines' 
flights to Milwaukee[11]. 
5. Reflecting the upswing in air-travel demand as more and more people are being administered the COVID-19 
vaccines, management at United Airlines UAL[12] expects adjusted pre-tax income for July to be positive. If this 
expectation comes true, the next month will definitely mark the first period since January 2020 when this key metric 
takes a favorable turn. Performance The following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the 
past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that most airline stocks barring American Airlines AAL[13] have traded in the red over the 
past week, inducing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to dip 4.2% to $100. However, over the course of the past six 
months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 16.2%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Investors will

 Shares of Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] fell 2.4% at the close of business on Jun 28, following tighter travel 
restrictions imposed in some parts of Europe to contain the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus. Among 
several other travel stocks, shares of U.S. carriers such as Delta Air Lines DAL[2] and United Airlines UAL[3] also 
declined on Monday. 
While Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), Delta and United Airlines carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. 
The Portuguese government has introduced measures to restrict non-vaccinated travelers from the United 
Kingdom[4]. U.K. travelers will not be allowed to enter the country without a 14-day quarantine period, unless they 
are 
fully 
vaccinated.

 Malta, which is on the U.K.'s green travel list, has also decided to allow only double-vaccinated people from the 
United Kingdom, beginning Jun 30, when relaxations on traveling to the U.K.'s green-listed places are set to go into 
effect. Being included in the U.K.'s green list implies that U.K. residents can travel to these places without having to 
quarantine (provided their COVID-19 test results are negative) on their return. 
In Spain, U.K. travelers are required to provide proof of full vaccination or a negative PCR test to be allowed entry. 
The restrictions across Europe have been imposed with particular emphasis on U.K. travelers since the Delta 
variant, which was first spotted in India, has been more prominent in the country. 
The stricter restrictions might weigh on Ryanair's summer travel bookings. The airline recently announced seat 
additions on flights from the United Kingdom to Malta for July, August and September. Moreover, earlier this month, 
the European low-cost carrier began operating flights to Faro, Portugal from Teesside, United Kingdom as part of its 
UK Summer 2021 Schedule. A Key Pick A better-ranked stock in the broader Transportation[7] sector is Expeditors

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has acquired 296 weekly slots at London Stansted from easyJet (U2, London Luton) for 
the Winter 2021/22 season, having already completed a similar swap, but for summer slots, last year.
ACL disclosures indicate the exchange will become effective November 1, 2021. Due to the seasonal character of 
slot allocations, the previous swap of summer slots will not, by itself, affect the apportionment of winter slots. 
However, now that Ryanair has acquired both summer and winter slots, it will retain them based on historical rights 
for future seasons.
The Irish low-cost carrier has so far filed a placeholder schedule with no indication as to its planned Stansted winter 
network.
easyJet announced in 2020 that it would close its base at Stansted to focus on London Luton and London Gatwick 
in the London agglomeration (both bases are operated by easyJet UK). However, the airline continues to serve 
Stansted from other bases.
easyJet had 326 weekly slots allocated in the initial Winter 2021/22 season plan. It will retain 30 weekly slots at 
Stansted while easyJet Europe has a further 28. Even before the swap, Ryanair had 2,515 weekly slots allocated at 
Stansted, 77.8% of Stansted's total capacity.
According to the ch-aviation capacities module, Ryanair (together with Ryanair UK) controls the Stansted market 
with an 80.2% market share by capacity. By comparison, easyJet has a 4.9% market share.

Spain and Portugal have imposed new restrictions on  British visitors, who on arrival will now have to provide proof 
of vaccination or else quarantine for 14 days.
Portugal said the new rules came into effect today (Monday) and will last until at least 11 July.
As Portugal is on Britain's amber list, all visitors will also have to self-isolate for up to ten days when they return 
home.
Spain today also said that all visitors from the UK to the Balearic Islands including Mallorca, Ibiza will soon be 
required either to show a negative result in a PCR Covid-19 test or to provide proof of two vaccination jabs.
 Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: "What we are going to do is apply to British tourists who go to the Balearic 
islands the same requirements we make of other European citizens," Mr Sanchez told Cadena SER radio.
"They will need a full dose of vaccine or a negative PCR," he added
The new rules will come into force within 72 hours, Mr Sanchez said, though he did not say from when.
European leaders have become increasingly worried about the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in the UK, 
which has been affecting the young and least vaccinated section of the UK's population.
Europe's vaccination programme is running well behind the UK and several leaders are worried about the highly 
contagious nature of the Delta variant might spark a new wave of infections.
Spain and Portugal tighten rules on British tourists, airlines knocked
German chancellor Angela Merkel has called for all British visitors to the EU to be banned whether they are 
vaccinated or not, while French PM Emmanuel Macron wants a two-week quarantine period to be imposed.
Spain and Portugal are reported to be reluctant to impose any further restrictions.
New Health Secretary Sajid Javid is set to address MPs today over the timeline of the easing of the UK's Covid-19 
restrictions in his first speech since taking over after Matt Hancock's resignation at the weekend.
Shares in airline and travels firms took another bashing on the back of the proposed travel tightening.
British Airways owner IAG (LON:IAG) fell 4.8% to 178.5p, easyJet (LON;EZK) dropped 3.3% to 924p and Ryanair 
PLC (LON;RYA) shed 2.8% to (EURO)15.93.

 Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[1] announced the addition of 200,000 seats on flights from the United Kingdom to 
Malta and the Balearics (Ibiza and Palma) for July, August and September. This follows the U.K. government's 
inclusion of these islands into the green list for travel, which allows people to visit these places without having to 
quarantine (provided their COVID-19 test results are negative) on their return. The relaxation is set to go into effect 
from Jun 30. 
As part of a promotion, Ryanair had offered tickets for just 19.99 on bookings by midnight of Jun 27, for travel 
through the end of September 2021. Moreover, the airline stated that it will allow customers to change their travel 
plans (up to two times) with no change fee until the end of December 2021. 
With these islands being added to the green list, the airline called on British transport minister Grant Shapps to add 
other 'equally safe destinations such as Cyprus, the Canaries &#38; the Greek Islands.' It also urged the 
government to 'immediately allow vaccinated UK &#38; EU citizens to travel freely between the UK &#38; the EU 
without 
restrictions.'

 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] shares have dropped 2.3% in the past six months against the industry[2]'s 8.5% 
increase. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Reasons for Plunge The resurgence of coronavirus cases in some 
parts of Europe had worsened the already weak travel demand scenario, thanks to the recent travel-related 
restrictions. Evidently, the airline's March traffic plunged 91% year over year to merely 0.5 million guests. The 
carrier's load factor (percentage of seats filled with passengers) in the month was 77% compared with 91% a year 
ago. In April, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) fell further to 67%. In May, the airline operated more than 
12,000 flights with a load factor of 79%. 
Amid coronavirus-led travel-demand woes, the airline regarded fiscal 2021 as the most 'challenging' in its 35-year 
history. The airline anticipates first-quarter fiscal 2022 traffic to be only between 5 million and 6 million guests. 
Ryanair anticipates slow vaccine rollout in the European Union to affect fiscal 2022 traffic. The airline estimates its 
fiscal 2022 traffic to be at the low end of the guidance of 80-120 million passengers, as a result of 'Easter travel 
restrictions/lockdowns and a delayed traffic recovery into the peak summer 21 season, due to the slow rollout in the 
EU of COVID-19 vaccines. Unfavorable Estimate Revisions The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year 
earnings has declined 93.5% to 6 cents per share in the past 60 days. Zacks Rank &#38; Stocks to Consider 
Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). 
Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Transportation [3]sector are Landstar System, Inc. LSTR[4], Triton 
International Limited TRTN[5] and FedEx Corporation FDX[6]. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can 
see the complete list of today's Zacks #1(Strong Buy) Rank stocks here[7]. 
Long-term (three to five years) expected earnings per share growth rate for Landstar, Triton and FedEx is projected 
at 12%, 10% and 12%, respectively. Bitcoin, Like the Internet Itself, Could Change Everything Blockchain and 
cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it the 'Internet of

Ryanair has announced 200,000 extra seats from the UK to Malta, Ibiza & Palma in July, August & September as 
these islands make it onto the UK's green listed destinations. Ryanair called on Grant Shapps to immediately add 
Cyprus, the Canaries, and the Greek Islands, where COVID case rates are equally low.
Ryanair's Dara Brady said: "This announcement is a small step in the right direction and while we welcome the 
addition of Malta and the Balearics to the UK's green list, we urge the Govt to immediately add equally safe 
destinations such as Cyprus, the Canaries and the Greek Islands, and to immediately allow vaccinated UK and EU 
citizens to travel freely between the UK and the EU without restrictions.
UK families can book a well-earned summer holiday safe in the knowledge that if their plans change, they can move 
their travel dates up to two times with a zero-change fee up until the end of December 2021.

 Ryanair Flight 4978 was subject to a bomb threat in Belarussian airspace on May 23 and it was escorted to Minsk 
by a MIG-29 fighter jet where opposition activist Roman Protasevich was detained, along with his girlfriend. 
Condemnation of the episode was swift with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen descrbing "the 
hijacking of the Ryanair plane bythe Belarus regime[3]as an attack on democracy" while U.S. President Joe Biden 
condemned it "in the strongest possible terms".  
 As Statista's Niall McCarthy notes,[4] the event served as a reminder that some sections of international airspace 
carry an inherent level of risk for passenger flights.  
 Cases of "air piracy" have proven rare down through the years but the Ryanair incident has striking similarities to 
another forced diversion that occurred in July 1971. That involved a BOAC flight carrying two men associated with 
an abortive coup d'tat attempt in Sudan being forced to land in Benghazi, Libya by the Gaddafi regime. The men in 
question were handed over to Sudan and immediately executed upon orders from the country's new president. 
More recently, the shootdown of Ukraine International Flight 752 over Tehran in 2020 and the destruction of 
Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Eastern Ukraine in 2014 have shown thatconflict and geopolitical tensions also 
pose a risk to commercial airliners[5].  
 Other notable cases down through the years include USS Vincennes shooting down Iran Air Flight 655 in 1988 with 
the loss of all 290 people on board as well as Korean Air Lines Flight 007 which was shot down by a Soviet SU-15 
fighter jet in 1983 with all 269 crew and passengers onboard perishing. Give those incidents and the recent shock 
emanating from Belarus, which parts of the world pose the greatest risk to civilian air traffic in 2021? The bulk of 
airspace safety alerts are released by the U.S. (FAA), UK (DFT), Germany (BMVI) and France (DGAC) and they 
have been brought together by theConflict Zone and Risk Database[6]across three levels of risk classification.  
'No Fly Zones' - These Are The Most Dangerous Airspaces To Travel Through
 https://www.statista.com/chart/25151/commercial-airspace-by-risk-level/  
 You will find more infographics at Statista[7]  
 The first and most severe classification is Level 1 which involves a moderate risk level where airlines are strongly 
urged to avoid the airspace entirely. The classification is due to highly unstable events on the ground and the 
possibility that factions possess MANPADS (man-portable air-defense systems) or other surface-to-air missiles. 
Libya, Iran, Syria and Yemen are currently classified as being a Level 1 risk.  
 Level 2 involves assessed warnings for certain airspace sections or altitudes with Afghanistan, Belarus, North 
Korea and Ukraine among the countries classified as such.  
 Level 3 is the least severe classification which involves a state of caution where a security review should be 
conducted before flights operate within a country's airspace.

Belarus has moved dissident blogger Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega to house arrest a month 
after President Alexander Lukashenko's regime sparked international outrage when it captured them after forcing 
down a Ryanair flight.
Officials in Minsk said the couple had struck a plea bargain under which they had agreed to co-operate with 
investigators, "expose co-conspirators" and confess to protest-related charges under which they face up to 15 years 
in prison.
The office of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus's exiled opposition leader, said that the duo were still "hostages".
"Roman's parents ... are not told anything about their son, they are not allowed to communicate with him," her office 
said.
Franak Viacorka, an aide to Tsikhanouskaya, said Belarus was attempting to engineer an easing of new sanctions 
announced by the EU, US, UK and Canada this week. The restrictions target 86 individuals and organisations as 
well as the country's potash and petroleum sectors, a crucial source of hard currency.
"We expect that under this sanction pressure the regime will be trying to exchange batches of prisoners for lifting 
sanctions," he told the Financial Times.
"[The EU should] not trust a single word that Lukashenko says," he added.
Belarus dissident transferred from prison to house arrest; Sanctions
EU leaders this week called for the "immediate release of all political prisoners and arbitrarily detained persons" in 
Belarus.
One senior EU diplomat said bloc foreign ministers were unconvinced this week by a suggestion from Minsk that it 
could release some political prisoners if the EU eased proposed sanctions on Belarus. "The only thing the EU will 
consider discussing is an immediate release of all 500 political prisoners and fair elections," the official said.
Protasevich's arrest is part of Belarus's crackdown on dissent since huge protests against Lukashenko's dubious 
election win last year. About 35,000 Belarusians have been arrested. The former editor of Nexta, an opposition 
channel on messaging app Telegram, is accused of organising mass riots, and faces up to 15 years in jail if 
convicted. Sapega has been accused of causing unrest.
A western diplomat said moving Protasevich and Sapega to house arrest seemed part of an attempt to try to start 
negotiations with the west.

Airlines shares grounded again as green list changes branded 'not enough'
Airlines shares grounded again as green list changes branded 'not enough'

Airlines and package holiday operators have reported a surge in demand for holidays to countries placed on the 
green list yesterday, but City analysts don't expect any material uptick in fortunes for the carriers.
Sixteen destinations were added to the list so visitors don't have to quarantine when they now return from the 
Balearics, Malta and Madeira.
Airlines today said that they were putting on additional flights to meet the demand. Ryanair PLC (LON;RYA) said it 
was laying 200,000 additional seats to Malta, Ibiza and Palma for July, August and September.
Jet2 , meanwhile, said it had seen the highest volume of bookings to the Balearic Islands in almost a year, with 
bookings for July alone up more than 3,000%.
Bookings for Malta and Madeira had jumped by almost 1,500% said the airline.
Brokers at Peel Hunt, however, said the absence of the Greek Islands and any mainland destinations such as 
Spain, Portugal and Italy was disappointing.
Also, with Malta an exception, all the additions are on a green watch list, meaning they can become amber again if 
the number of COID-19 cases rises.
Government comments today were that fully vaccinated people will be able to travel from an amber list country 
without quarantine later this summer, but this change won't come quickly enough to help the airlines said the 
broker.
Airlines shares grounded again as green list changes branded 'not enough'
"With the next review not due for around three weeks, the start of the school holidays at the earliest, and the risk 
that more EU countries require travellers from the UK to quarantine, bookings through July are likely to remain 
subdued."
Sean Doyle, British Airways' chief executive, also expressed disappointment.
"We cannot afford another missed summer. There are jobs at stake, Britons separated from family members and 
we cannot afford to allow the success of our vaccine programme to be wasted," he said.
Analysts said investors interested in the sector need to look to those airlines that have a good market share and a 
record of cost management.
Peel Hunt highlighted  Jet2 (LON:JET2) reiterating its 'buy' rating and target price of 1,580p.
Describing the changes in the green list as a 'small step' towards reopening travel, it sees demand remaining 
constrained though Jet2 is better capitalised than its competition and may be able to use the proceeds of the recent 
£387mln convertible issue to acquire a younger fleet inexpensively. 
Shares in Jet2 fell 2.8% to 1,233p and easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways owner IAG all too lost ground.

Pressure mounts on UK to lift travel curbs
Pressure mounts on UK to lift travel curbs

Legal action against the UK government's COVID-19 travel curbs is gaining momentum with the country's biggest 
tour operator, TUI Group and a number of airlines joining a challenge lead by Ryanair and the Manchester Airports 
Group (MAG).
The legal bid - backed by easyJet, British Airways' owner IAG International Airlines Group, and Virgin Atlantic - is 
an attempt to get the government to be more transparent in how it determines which countries are on the green, 
amber, and red lists under the UK's "traffic light" system for international travel. The system ranks countries 
according to their COVID-19 risk and accordingly imposes quarantine measures on travellers on their return to the 
UK.
The result has been that the UK travel industry remains effectively closed as rules require 10 days quarantine for 
arrivals from all European Union countries and the United States, which are on the amber list. The UK government 
still advises against travel to most countries, except for a handful that are on the green list.
The judicial review has been prompted by the lack of transparency in how the government made decisions in its first 
review of the traffic light lists on June 3, which saw Portugal unexpectedly and without prior notice moved from 
green to amber, causing chaos for holidaymakers and the industry alike. The government has also delayed the final 
lifting of lockdown for a further month to July 19.
During a "Travel Day of Action" lead by the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), pilots, cabin crew, travel 
agents, and other travel industry workers on Wednesday (June 23) protested and picketed across the UK, urging 
politicians to reopen foreign routes. The protests were timed ahead of the government's second review of 
requirements for international travel at the end of June.
In court papers - in which both the Secretary of State for Health and the Secretary of State for Transport are named 
as the defendants - MAG said the government had a duty to clearly explain how it makes decisions on categorising 
countries, and to publish the supporting data, given the "dramatic" impact these decisions have on aviation 
businesses.
A spokesman for MAG told reporters the court had accepted its application for an expedited hearing and the 
Transport Minister and the Health Minister had until Monday (June 28) to file a defence. A date for a hearing was 
likely to be set either later next week or for the following week, added the spokesperson.
Pressure mounts on UK to lift travel curbs
The government has stated its travel rules sought to balance the reopening of international travel with safeguarding 
public health and protecting the country's vaccine programme.
But Ryanair has charged the UK travel policy was "a confusing go-stop-go-stop system, which is doing untold 
damage to the UK's inbound tourism industry".
"The UK's COVID travel policy is a shambles," charged Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary. "The green list is 
non-existent because countries such as Malta and Portugal, with lower COVID case numbers than the UK and 
rapidly rising vaccination rates, remain on amber. Meanwhile, UK citizens almost 80% of whom will be vaccinated 
by the end of June, continue to face COVID restrictions on travel to and from the European Union, despite the fact 
that the majority of the European Union citizens will also be vaccinated by the end of June."
MAG chief executive, Charlie Cornish, said: "The government is not being open and we simply cannot understand 
how it is making decisions that are fundamental to our ability to plan, and to giving customers the confidence to 
book travel ahead."
"When this framework was put together, consumers were promised a waiting list to allow them to plan," commented 
easyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren. "Yet the government has torn up its own rule book and ignored the 
science, throwing peoples' plans into chaos, with virtually no notice or alternative options for travel from the UK. 
This decision essentially cuts the UK off from the rest of the world."

Jailed Belarus Activist, Girlfriend Moved To House Arrest

 Belarus investigators said Friday that dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was dramatically detained after 
his plane was forced to land in Minsk, has been moved to house arrest. 
Protasevich, 26, was arrested in May along with his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, when Belarusian 
authorities scrambled a fighter jet to intercept their Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania as it passed over 
Belarus. 
They are accused of helping to coordinate historic anti-government protests last year, which erupted after 
strongman President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a sixth term in an August vote the opposition and Western 
leaders said was rigged. 
On Friday, the Belarusian Investigative Committee said in a statement on its Telegram channel that it had moved 
both Protasevich and Sapega to house arrest. 
The committee said it had "found it possible" to do so because the pair had given "consistent confessions," are 
cooperating with investigators and had appealed their pre-trial detention. 
After their arrests, both Protasevich and Sapega appeared in "confession" videos that their supporters said were 
recorded under duress and are a common tactic of the regime to pressure critics. 
Earlier on Friday, an advisor to exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said that he had spoken with 
Protasevich's parents, who told him their son had been moved to house arrest 
 "But it's not freedom. It is a prison of different type. KGB people live in the same room with him," tweeted Franak 
Viacorka, referring to Belarus's national intelligence agency. 
Sapega's lawyer Alexander Filanovich said on his Telegram channel that he expected her case to be "resolved 
positively in the near future".

diverted plane last month Photo: AFP / STRINGER  
Tikhanovskya described the development as "good news" but added on her Telegram channel that the pair is "still 
being held hostage." 
The 38-year-old opponent of Lukashenko was forced into exile in EU member state Lithuania shortly after last 
year's anti-government protests began. 
Most of the moustachioed strongman's opponents are now either in jail or have fled the country. 
Jailed Belarus Activist, Girlfriend Moved To House Arrest
Amnesty International said in a statement on Friday that the decision to move Protasevich and Sapega to house 
arrest "looks like a cynical ploy" to lift international sanctions. 
"Over the past year, the world has watched in horror as Alexander Lukashenko's government crushed peaceful 
dissent with unspeakable cruelty -- these transfers to house arrest change nothing," the rights group said. 
On Friday, the Belarusian prosecutor's office announced that arrested opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova and 
Maxim Znak, a lawyer for arrested opposition figure Viktor Babaryko, had been charged with "conspiracy to seize 
power". 
The European Union and the United States have imposed waves of sanctions on Lukashenko and his allies over 
the crackdown on the protests that saw thousands detained. 
In response to Protasevich and Sapega's arrests, Brussels banned Belarusian state carrier Belavia from operating 
flights to airports in the 27-nation bloc and discouraged EU-based airlines from flying over Belarus. 
Earlier this week, the EU, US, Britain and Canada announced fresh sanctions on the ex-Soviet country over the 
arrests. 
In a statement on Friday, the Belarusian foreign ministry said the goal of the penalties was "to disintegrate and 
undermine a sovereign and independent state".

The Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who were arrested during a 
forced landing of a Ryanair flight, have been transferred to house arrest, his mother and the Belarus' opposition 
leader said on Friday.
Natalia Protasevich, who lives in exile in Poland, told dpa that her daughter, who lives in Minsk, drove to an address 
given to her on Thursday evening where she met her brother and handed him food and clothes.
But the mother said neither the family nor the lawyers have received official updates from Belarusian authorities on 
the status of Roman. Instead, the family is relying on private channels for information.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said Friday that Protasevich and Sapega were now under 
house arrest.
The Russian embassy in Minsk confirmed the house arrest for Sapega, a Russian national. But the authorities in 
the Belarusian capital have yet to comment.
Tikhanovskaya called it "good news"' but added: "House arrest - that is not freedom."
Protasevich and Sapega still faced charges and were "hostages" of the system under Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko, she said.
"We are in contact with Roman's parents - they are not given any information regarding their son, and they have no 
possibility to talk to him themselves. They are convinced that the regime is playing a game, using the lives of 
Roman and Sofia."
Over 500 further prisoners were also currently being held in Belarusian prisons, Tikhanovskaya said.
Jailed Belarusian journalist and girlfriend moved into house arrest
On May 23, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius to stop over 
in Minsk and detained government critic Protasevich and Sapega who were on board.
Strongman Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for around 27 years and is often dubbed "Europe's last dictator," 
has faced criticism for a dangerous encroachment on airspace after the operation, which included a fighter jet.

Jailed Belarusian journalist and girlfriend moved into house arrest
Jailed Belarusian journalist and girlfriend moved into house arrest

The Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who were arrested during 
the forced landing of a Ryanair flight, have been transferred to house arrest, Belarusian authorities confirmed on 
Friday.
According to the investigation committee, both had made "consistent confessions" and agreed to cooperate with 
investigators.
The move was first announced by the blogger's mother and Belarus' opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 
earlier on Friday.
Natalia Protasevich, who lives in exile in Poland, told dpa that her daughter, who lives in Minsk, drove to an address 
given to her on Thursday evening where she met her brother and handed him food and clothes.
But the mother said neither the family nor the lawyers have received official updates from Belarusian authorities on 
Roman's status. Instead, the family is relying on private channels for information.
She pointed out that the public prosecution's charges against her son remained. The authoritarian leadership in 
Minsk accuses the 26-year-old blogger of organizing mass unrest against long-time ruler Alexander Lukashenko 
and thus "grossly violating public order," among other things.
The Russian embassy in Minsk confirmed the house arrest for Sapega, a Russian national.
Sapega's lawyer told independent online broadcaster Dozhd that she was able to meet her parents in a restaurant 
in Minsk, but there were certain restrictions due to the house arrest. His client was banned from using online 
communication and under surveillance, the lawyer told the Interfax news agency.
Jailed Belarusian journalist and girlfriend moved into house arrest
He attributed the development to a meeting between Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
According to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Belarusian authorities alone were responsible for the decision 
to transfer the couple into house arrest, while Russian diplomats continued to represent the interests of Sapega.
Belarusian opposition leader Tikhanovskaya called the development "good news" but added: "House arrest - that is 
not freedom."
Protasevich and Sapega still faced charges and were "hostages" of the system under Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko, she said.
"We are in contact with Roman's parents - they are not given any information regarding their son, and they have no 
possibility to talk to him themselves. They are convinced that the regime is playing a game, using the lives of 
Roman and Sofia."
Over 500 further prisoners were also currently being held in Belarusian prisons, Tikhanovskaya said.
On May 23, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius to stop over 
in Minsk and detained government critic Protasevich and Sapega who were on board.
Strongman Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for around 27 years and is often dubbed "Europe's last dictator," 
has faced criticism for a dangerous encroachment on airspace after the operation, which included a fighter jet.
The EU has since imposed economic sanctions against the former Soviet nation over the incident, particularly 
targeting state-owned companies and restricting access to the EU's capital market.
The Belarusian Foreign Ministry on Friday again threatened with retaliation without announcing concrete measures, 
however.
"In the coming weeks, the retaliatory measures we have repeatedly announced will be phased in," it said in a 
statement. "It is high time for European politicians to be clear that pressure and sanctions are not the right language 
to talk to Belarus."

       U.K. stocks rose on Friday to extend gains from the previous session after the Bank of England kept its 
monetary policy ultra-loose.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 inched up 6 points to 7,116 as higher commodity prices helped lift shares of miners and 
energy companies. The index rose half a percent the previous day.
 Mining giant BHP rose about 1 percent and Rio Tinto added half a percent.
 In the oil & gas sector, BP Plc advanced 1.2 percent and Royal Dutch Shell gained 1 percent.
 Building materials business CRH rallied 2.3 percent after a brokerage upgrade.
 Travel-related stocks slipped, with EasyJet falling 1 percent and Ryanair Holdings down half a percent.
 The U.K. is set to publish plans next month to lift travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people except those with the 
highest COVID-19 risk level.
 UDG Healthcare advanced 1.2 percent. The company, which is in deal to be taken over by Nenelite Ltd., said its 
board was informed that Nenelite is considering an improved and final offer of 1,080 pence per UDG Share.
 Subprime lender Amigo jumped 6.8 percent on news it has secured a three-month extension to a funding line.
 In economic releases, U.K. consumer sentiment remained unchanged in June, survey results from market research 
group GfK showed.
 The consumer confidence index held steady at -9.0 in June, while it was forecast to rise to -7.0. "A repetition of last 
month's score doesn't mean confidence is about to nose-dive," Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said.

The Covid-19 crisis could cause lasting damage to western liberal democracies that adopted authoritarian 
measures during the pandemic, Estonia's prime minister has warned.
Kaja Kallas told the Financial Times she was afraid that some countries had been slow to relax restrictions on free 
movement of people and goods, even as vaccination rates increased.
"What we have seen in this Covid crisis, this urge for a strong hand or an authoritarian way of governing, is deep in 
our societies, even in some countries you would never believe."
The prime minister of the smallest Baltic state said some governments had moved to vastly limit people's rights. 
"Even if you don't have the epidemiological reasons now, we are not giving people the freedoms back because it's 
more convenient this way," she said.
Estonia has been particularly exercised by travel restrictions in neighbouring Finland, which stopped numerous 
Estonians who work in the Nordic country from using ferries to return home. Finland relaxed those restrictions from 
Monday, after the interview with Kallas.
But the Estonian prime minister also criticised moves by bigger EU member states - including Germany and France 
- to impose export bans on protective equipment earlier in the pandemic. "These restrictions came quickly, out of 
nowhere. I'm worried that it's too easily rising up in times of crisis," she added.
Estonian PM warns of authoritarian creep during pandemic Covid restrictions
Her comments carry weight as, since regaining its independence from the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago, 
Estonia has become one of the flag-bearers for liberal democracy as a staunch member of Nato and the EU.
Estonia, like fellow Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania, has consistently warned the EU about the dangers from 
neighbouring Russia and Belarus.
Kallas said she was "glad" that last month's forced landing by Belarus of a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to 
Vilnius and the seizing of the dissident, Roman Protasevich, had "opened up some eyes" in the EU to the country's 
authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko. Speaking ahead of Monday's decision by the EU to impose 
wideranging new sanctions on Belarus, she said Europe needed to target how Lukashenko financed his regime.
"Sanctions must be targeted so that they hit Lukashenko the most. The power structures in Belarus are behind 
Lukashenko so he feels secure. When he doesn't have the money to finance the power structures, then there would 
be growing dissatisfaction and then there might be change," she said last week.
Kallas, Estonia's prime minister since January, said the Ryanair incident had clearly been a message to all 
dissidents: "You're not safe anywhere, we're going to get you." She said the second message was: "We can do this. 
I don't think they - meaning Belarus and Russia - expected any reaction. They only go as far as we let them."
Before Kallas came to power, Estonia's international image had taken a battering because of the presence in 
government of the far-right Ekre party, whose leaders have insulted everybody from gay people and immigrants to 
US president Joe Biden and Finland prime minister Sanna Marin.
The government coalition, including Ekre and led by the Centre party, resigned in January over a sprawling property 
corruption scandal, paving the way for Kallas.
But the 44-year-old has endured a difficult start as prime minister. Estonia was hit hard by the third Covid wave as 
soon as she took office, becoming in March the European nation with the highest infection rate.
Kallas has faced domestic criticism for her handling of the pandemic, although the situation is now improving. 
Meanwhile Ekre, back in opposition, has reached record support levels in opinion polls.

Jailed Belarus activist, girlfriend moved to house arrest

 Belarus investigators said Friday that dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was dramatically detained after 
his plane was forced to land in Minsk, has been moved to house arrest. 
 Protasevich, 26, was arrested in May along with his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, when Belarusian 
authorities scrambled a fighter jet to intercept their Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania as it passed over 
Belarus. 
 They are accused of helping to coordinate historic anti-government protests last year, which erupted after 
strongman President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a sixth term in an August vote the opposition and Western 
leaders said was rigged. 
 On Friday, the Belarusian Investigative Committee said in a statement on its Telegram channel that it had moved 
both Protasevich and Sapega to house arrest. 
 The committee said it had 'found it possible' to do so because the pair had given 'consistent confessions,' are 
cooperating with investigators and had appealed their pre-trial detention.  
 After their arrests, both Protasevich and Sapega appeared in 'confession' videos that their supporters said were 
recorded under duress and are a common tactic of the regime to pressure critics. 
 Earlier on Friday, an advisor to exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said that he had spoken with 
Protasevich's parents, who told him their son had been moved to house arrest 
 'But it's not freedom. It is a prison of different type. KGB people live in the same room with him,' tweeted Franak 
Viacorka, referring to Belarus's national intelligence agency. 
 Sapega's lawyer Alexander Filanovich said on his Telegram channel that he expected her case to be 'resolved 
positively in the near future'. 
- 'Held hostage' - 
Tikhanovskya described the development as 'good news' but added on her Telegram channel that the pair is 'still 
being held hostage.' 
 The 38-year-old opponent of Lukashenko was forced into exile in EU member state Lithuania shortly after last 
year's anti-government protests began. 
Jailed Belarus activist, girlfriend moved to house arrest
 Most of the moustachioed strongman's opponents are now either in jail or have fled the country. 
 Amnesty International said in a statement on Friday that the decision to move Protasevich and Sapega to house 
arrest 'looks like a cynical ploy' to lift international sanctions. 
 'Over the past year, the world has watched in horror as Alexander Lukashenko's government crushed peaceful 
dissent with unspeakable cruelty — these transfers to house arrest change nothing,' the rights group said. 
 On Friday, the Belarusian prosecutor's office announced that arrested opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova and 
Maxim Znak, a lawyer for arrested opposition figure Viktor Babaryko, had been charged with 'conspiracy to seize 
power'. 
 The European Union and the United States have imposed waves of sanctions on Lukashenko and his allies over 
the crackdown on the protests that saw thousands detained. 
 In response to Protasevich and Sapega's arrests, Brussels banned Belarusian state carrier Belavia from operating 
flights to airports in the 27-nation bloc and discouraged EU-based airlines from flying over Belarus. 
 Earlier this week, the EU, US, Britain and Canada announced fresh sanctions on the ex-Soviet country over the 
arrests. 
 In a statement on Friday, the Belarusian foreign ministry said the goal of the penalties was 'to disintegrate and 
undermine a sovereign and independent state'.

 Belarus's opposition-in-exile said Friday that dissident journalist Roman Protasevich, who was dramatically 
detained after his plane was forced to land in Minsk, has been moved to house arrest. 
 Protasevich, 26, was arrested in May along with his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega, 23, when Belarusian 
authorities scrambled a fighter jet to intercept their Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania as it passed over 
Belarus. 
 They are accused of helping to coordinate historic anti-government protests last year, which erupted after 
strongman President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a sixth term in an August vote the opposition and Western 
leaders said was rigged. 
 On Friday, an advisor to exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said that he had spoken with 
Protasevich's parents, who told him their son had been moved to house arrest. 
 'But it's not freedom. It is a prison of different type. KGB people live in the same room with him,' tweeted Franak 
Viacorka, referring to Belarus's national intelligence agency. 
 The comments confirmed an earlier report by the BBC's Russian service, which cited Protasevich's father Dmitry 
as saying that his son had been moved to house arrest. 
 Sapega's lawyer Alexander Filanovich said on his Telegram channel that she had also been moved to house 
arrest. 
 He added that he expected her case to be 'resolved positively in the near future'. 
- 'Held hostage' - 
Tikhanovskya described the development as 'good news' but added on her Telegram channel that the pair is 'still 
being held hostage.' 
 The 38-year-old opponent of Lukashenko was forced into exile to EU member state Lithuania shortly after last 
year's anti-government protests began. 
 Most of the moustachioed strongman's opponents are now either in jail or have fled the country.

 After their arrests, both Protasevich and Sapega appeared in 'confession' videos that their supporters said were 
recorded under duress and are a common tactic of the regime to pressure critics.

 Belarus views Western sanctions, imposed in response to Minsk's forced landing of a Ryanair plane last month to 
arrest a journalist on board, as a declaration of economic war, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement, writes 
Alexander Marrow, Reuters. 
Western powers hit Belarus with a wave of new sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/west-hits-belarus-
with-new-sanctions-over-ryanair-piracy-2021-06-21/on Monday (21 June) in a co-ordinated response against 
officials, lawmakers and ministers from the administration of President Alexander Lukashenko (pictured), whose air 
force intercepted the Ryanair plane flying between Athens and Vilnius on 23 May in what the West called state 
piracy. 
Minsk said the sanctions would negatively impact the interests of its citizens and warned that it would be forced to 
take reciprocal measures that could in turn adversely affect citizens and businesses of Western countries. 
"[The EU] continues purposeful destructive actions against the population in order, allegedly, to "dry up the regime 
financially." In fact, this borders on a declaration of economic war," the ministry said.

EU slaps economic sanctions on Belarus over rights breaches
EU slaps economic sanctions on Belarus over rights breaches

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union slapped economic sanctions on Belarus on Thursday in response to what 
the bloc called the “escalation of serious human rights violations” including the detention of journalist Raman 
Pratasevich.
The sanctions target the economy but are also aimed at hitting President Alexander Lukashenko and his allies.
Lukashenko raised the prospect of imposing martial law in response to the sanctions, but it was not clear what the 
aim would be of such a move.
“We must show these scoundrels on the other side of the border that their sanctions are their impotence,” he said, 
according to a report on the presidential website.
Pratasevich, a dissident journalist, was arrested May 23 after Belarusian flight controllers ordered a Ryanair jet 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk.
The sanctions agreed upon Thursday target industries including potash — a common fertilizer ingredient — tobacco 
industry exports and petroleum products.
“Trade in petroleum products, potassium chloride (‘potash’), and goods used for the production or manufacturing of 
tobacco products is restricted,” the EU said. The sanctions also include a ban on sales to Belarus of equipment and 
software that can be used to monitor the internet and phone calls.
The sanctions also restrict Belarus' access to EU capital markets and halted payments to the country's public sector 
by the European Investment Bank.
The EU has gradually ratcheted up sanctions since Lukashenko — dubbed the last dictator in Europe — won a 
sixth term last August in elections the bloc called fraudulent.
EU slaps economic sanctions on Belarus over rights breaches
The 27-nation bloc has taken a tougher line since the Ryanair incident, and over the country’s alleged use of 
migrants to pressure neighboring Lithuania, which has provided a safe haven to Belarusian opposition figures and 
is one of Lukashenko’s most vocal critics.
On Monday, EU foreign ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 78 Belarus officials and froze the 
assets of 8 “entities,” which are usually companies, banks, or associations. A total of 166 people and 15 entities in 
Belarus are now under EU restrictive measures. The United States, Britain and Canada also slapped sanctions on 
senior Belarus officials.
Independent political analyst Alexander Klaskouski told the Associated Press that the economic sanctions “are 
much stricter and more painful than the previous measures, which consisted only of blacklists of Belarusian officials 
and had practically no effect on Lukashenka’s behavior."
He said the EU imposed the sanctions despite fears the measures “could push Belarus towards Russia and make 
Lukashenko easy prey for the Kremlin.”
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said earlier that the economic sanctions would take aim at "economic areas 
that are of particular significance for Belarus and for the regime’s income.”
That provoked an angry reaction from Belarus, with the country's foreign ministry saying they would hurt ordinary 
people and “border on the declaration of an economic war.” The ministry warned the that the country would be 
forced to take retaliatory measures that would hurt Western companies.
Belarus has been shaken by months of protests fueled by Lukashenko’s re-election. The authorities responded with 
a massive crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police. Most opposition 
leaders have been jailed or forced to leave the country.
Since he was pulled off the Ryanair flight in Minsk, Pratasevich has been paraded on state TV, tearfully apologizing 
for his actions and praising Lukashenko. His parents, members of the opposition and others in the West believe he 
spoke under duress, with some saying there were signs he had been beaten.

The travel industry is anxiously awaiting Thursday's update on the UK government's measures for arrivals from 
foreign countries.
Malta and the Balearic Islands have been tipped as part of a "handful" of changes as ministers are keeping 
regulations tight after the end of lockdown in England was postponed from 21 June to 19 July.
If they make it, travellers from these destinations won't have to quarantine for ten days once they arrive in the UK 
starting on Tuesday 29 June.
Companies have also been lobbying the government to drop self-isolation requirements for travellers coming from 
amber countries if they have been fully vaccinated.
Boris Johnson said double jabs "offer a good way forward", the BBC reported, though he specified this summer 
wouldn't be like any other.
However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has pushed for tighter restrictions for people coming from the UK over 
concerns on the Delta variant, as cases continue to climb in Britain.
"In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that's not the case in every 
European country, and that's what I would like to see," she told the German parliament.
Italy has imposed a five-day quarantine to travellers from the UK, however Spain, Greece and Portugal have not 
imposed new measures. Fully vaccinated travellers don't need to quarantine in France.
Travel industry holds breath ahead of Thursday's green list update
Meanwhile, England is due to drop the mandatory mask use and social distancing measures on 19 July, when 
lockdown ends. Plans will be confirmed on Monday 5 July.
There were 15,882 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday with 19 deaths.
TUI AG (LON:TUI) and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) both added 2% to 412.15p and (EURO)16.63 
respectively, while British Airways owner IAG (LON:IAG) was flat at 193.72p on Thursday afternoon.

The European Union imposed its toughest sanctions yet on Belarus on Thursday, taking aim at petroleum and 
tobacco-manufacturing products plus potash - three sectors that the bloc sees as lining the pockets of Alexander 
Lukashenko's government.
Access to EU capital markets is also to be restricted, an EU press release announcing the implementation of the 
measures stated.
EU banks can no longer sell insurance or re-insurance to Belarusian government or public bodies, according to the 
press release, and the European Investment Bank is to stop transferring funds to public sector projects. Trading in 
certain surveillance technology or software to anyone in Belarus is also prohibited.
EU foreign ministers signed off on the move earlier this week. 
It is the bloc's latest response to Belarusian authorities' ongoing crackdown on pro-democratic forces following a 
contested August 2020 election, as well as the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to detain a government critic and 
his girlfriend last month.
The EU already adopted several packages of sanctions targeting Lukashenko's supporters last year, as well as the 
president himself.
Then, shortly after the flight incident, the bloc sealed off its airspace to carriers from its eastern neighbour.
The 66-year-old Lukashenko has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states 
Poland, Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.

Belarus' president, Alexander Lukashenko, has denounced Ukraine for joining the European Union in closing its 
airspace to Belarussian aircraft and said that in response, Belarus would no longer accept any flights from 
Ukrainian territory. "We must create equal conditions for our Belavia (B2, Minsk National) aircraft. If we have to fly 
this way, we will force others to fly this way to Belarus too," he told reporters outside a children's hospital in Minsk 
on June 19, as quoted by the news agency BelTA. 
Referring to the fact that the hospital had provided services for some Ukrainian families, he said: "We save their 
people here and will continue to do this. They, however, have decided to close their airspace for us, and we have to 
make a circle around them to get to Turkey and beyond." Speaking dressed in a white doctors' coat, he initially 
assured that Belarus would not yet be enforcing compulsory Covid-19 vaccinations across the country, despite a 
recent sharp rise in cases in Russia, but "if such a situation arises here, this principle will certainly be introduced." 
Hospital staff present then asked about the possibilities of travelling abroad during the summer. The EU's non-
binding recommendations, which banned all Belarus-flagged carriers and aircraft from operations to and over the 
bloc from June 5, aimed to penalise the country for the forced May 23 diversion of a Ryanair B737-800, en-route 
from Athens Int'l to Vilnius, followed by the arrest of two opposition journalists on board. Lukashenko recommended 
that the hospital staff consider the current situation and spend their vacation within Belarus, as all the necessary 
conditions to do this had been created. There are also opportunities, he added, to travel to resorts in and via 
Russia. "As for the Black Sea, Sochi, and Georgia, they are quite popular right now, and there are no problems with 
flights there, of course, as long as all the necessary tests are performed," he said. Meanwhile, Belarus' neighbour 
Lithuania, an EU member that is one of Lukashenko's loudest critics and has provided refuge to his political rival 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has claimed that migrants, many of them from Iraq, have been pouring across the 
border in recent weeks. It accused Lukashenko of organising the influx, allowing Belarusian border guards to turn a 
blind eye to the movement. After the EU introduced its ban, Lukashenko had vowed to unleash "migrants and 
drugs" on the bloc.

Foul called on plan for Euro 2020 VIPs to skip quarantine at Wembley finals
Foul called on plan for Euro 2020 VIPs to skip quarantine at Wembley finals

Plans to ease quarantine requirements on thousands of VIP delegates seeking to enter the UK for games at the 
Euro 2020 football tournament have sparked outrage among politicians and travel industry figures.
Senior officials are holding talks with Uefa, European football's governing body, to allow about 2,000 foreign fans 
and 2,000 VIPs to attend the semi-finals and final of the competition at Wembley next month, according to people 
close to discussions.
The government said it had agreed a deal with Uefa to keep the final and semi-final of the continent-wide 
competition at Wembley as planned after days of negotiation over the issue.
The exact number of people allowed to escape stringent quarantine rules will depend on the teams that qualify for 
the matches and whether their countries are on the UK's amber or red list for travel.
Only those arriving from a small number of green-listed countries are allowed to avoid a quarantine period of up to 
10 days on entry.
Instead, overseas attendees of the Euro 2020 matches will be told to stay in a "bubble" - allowed only to travel 
between airports, hotels and the stadium. Those attending for just one match would leave the UK within 24 hours of 
entry.
Foul called on plan for Euro 2020 VIPs to skip quarantine at Wembley finals
"If we hadn't [eased quarantine requirements] we would have lost the semi-final and the final [of the Euros]. People 
would have been furious," said a senior government figure. "They've promised to stay in their bubbles and just 
watch the matches and not go to any restaurants. We just have to hope that they stick to that agreement."
The government's willingness to relax its restrictions for the sake of a football tournament drew anger from 
politicians and travel officials.
"No elite of any kind should be allowed or enabled to circumvent laws which suppress the rights of others, however 
necessary," said Steve Baker, a Tory former minister.
John Healey, Labour's shadow defence minister, said the plan meant "one rule for important people ... and one rule 
for the rest".
Ryanair said: "The fact that the UK government is even considering allowing these so-called 'Uefa VIPs' to dodge 
quarantine rules is laughable. What scientific data and facts are they working from ... and how will it be enforced?"

UK's Travel Sector Gets A Green Light 
The Balearic Islands, which include hot spots like Ibiza and Mallorca, have been shifted to the green list alongside 
Portugal[4]'s Madeira, Malta and a handful of UK overseas territories. Shares in Ryanair, easyJet, Wizz Air and Tui 
all moved higher off the back of the announcement.

At this year's annual Robin Hood conference, which was held virtually, the founder of the world's largest hedge

marketplace. Q1 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more Dalio believes that by studying past market cycles

 It's a key development the majority of the airlines at this point. Long haul carriers like British Airways parent IAG 
will see few benefits from the phased re-opening. Domestic travel within Europe is still the largest segment for IAG, 
but roughly 30% of its business is reliant on travel to and from North America, which is still on hold. 
 For low cost carriers, this news is a welcome tailwind. easyJet has already proven it's ready to scale up its 
operations as needed to accommodate the ever-changing list of travel-friendly locations. No one will be heaving a 
larger sigh of relief than Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, whose strategy has been arguably the boldest among the 
group. Ryanair took delivery of its first batch of 'Gamechanger' aircraft just days after Portugal was removed from 
the green list, stoking fears that the O'Leary's decision to take advantage of favourable pricing and up its aircraft 
orders was a bit premature. 
Rolls Royce Shares Slump 
Summer Travel Gets A Green Light, But Not Everyone Is Flying High
Further up the food chain, Rolls Royce shares slumped. The group's bread and butter comes from servicing and 
delivering widebody aircraft[6] engines, which are used primarily for long-haul fligths. While the green list additions 
are good news, a few reopened routes isn't enough to excite investors. That's because Rolls' own recovery won't 
materialise until after the airlines are back to business as usual. 
 The big question now is whether the flurry of excitement over the newly green destinations will be enough to spur 
on new bookings. While we're confident that the pent-up demand is ready and waiting to fly, the headache that 
came with Portugal's downgrade may not be so easy to forget. Plus, it's not just the UK restrictions[7] we have to 
worry about. Shifting quarantine regulations in some European countries following German Chancellor Angela 
Merkel's calls for all British travellers to quarantine could add yet another spanner to the works.'

EU imposes sanctions on Belarusian economy

 The Council today (24 June) introduced new restrictive measures against the Belarusian regime to respond to the 
escalation of serious human rights violations in Belarus and the violent repression of civil society, democratic 
opposition and journalists, as well as to the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk on 23 May 2021 and the 
related detention of journalist Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega. 
The new targeted economic sanctions include the prohibition to directly or indirectly sell, supply, transfer or export 
to anyone in Belarus equipment, technology or software intended primarily for use in the monitoring or interception 
of the internet and of telephone communications, and dual-use goods and technologies for military use and to 
specified persons, entities or bodies in Belarus. Trade in petroleum products, potassium chloride ('potash'), and 
goods used for the production or manufacturing of tobacco products is restricted. Furthermore, access to EU capital 
markets is restricted, and providing insurance and re-insurance to the Belarusian government and Belarusian public 
bodies and agencies is prohibited. Lastly, the European Investment Bank will stop any disbursement or payment 
under any existing agreements in relation to projects in the public sector, and any existing Technical Assistance 
Service Contracts. 
Member states will also be required to take actions to limit the involvement in Belarus of multilateral development 
banks of which they are members. Today's decision fully implements the European Council conclusions of 24 and 
25 May 2021, in which EU heads of state and government called on the Council to ban overflight of EU airspace by 
Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines, and to adopt the 
necessary measures, including additional listings of persons and entities on the basis of the relevant sanctions 
framework, and to adopt further targeted economic sanctions. All of these measures have now been put in place. 
Since October 2020, the EU has progressively imposed restrictive measures against Belarus. The measures have 
been adopted in response to the fraudulent nature of the August 2020 presidential elections in the country, and the 
intimidation and violent repression of peaceful protesters, opposition members and journalists. A total of 166 
persons and 15 entities are currently subject to restrictive measures, which comprise an asset freeze applicable to 
both individuals and entities, and travel ban on individuals.

 Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko attends a ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary of Germany's attack 
on the Soviet Union in World War II in the Brest Fortress memorial, 360 km (225 miles) southwest of Minsk, 
Belarus, Tuesday, June 22, 2021. (Maxim Guchek/BelTA Pool Photo via AP) 
BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union slapped economic sanctions on Belarus on Thursday in response to what 
the bloc called the 'escalation of serious human rights violations' including the detention of journalist Raman 
Pratasevich. 
 The sanctions target the economy but are also aimed at hitting President Alexander Lukashenko and his allies. 
 Pratasevich, a dissident journalist, was arrested May 23 after Belarusian flight controllers ordered a Ryanair jet 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk. 
 The sanctions agreed upon Thursday target industries including potash — a common fertilizer ingredient — 
tobacco industry exports and petroleum products.  
 'Trade in petroleum products, potassium chloride ('potash'), and goods used for the production or manufacturing of 
tobacco products is restricted,' the EU said in a statement. The sanctions also include a ban on sales to Belarus of 
equipment and software that can be used to monitor the internet and phone calls. 
 The sanctions also restrict Belarus' access to EU capital markets and halted payments to the country's public 
sector by the European Investment Bank. 
 The EU has gradually ratcheted up sanctions since Lukashenko — dubbed the last dictator in Europe — won a 
sixth term last August in elections the bloc called fraudulent.  
 The 27-nation bloc has taken a tougher line since the Ryanair incident, and over the country's alleged use of 
migrants to pressure neighboring Lithuania, which has provided a safe haven to Belarusian opposition figures and 
is one of Lukashenko's most vocal critics. 
 On Monday, EU foreign ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 78 Belarus officials and froze the 
assets of 8 'entities,' which are usually companies, banks, or associations. A total of 166 people and 15 entities in 
Belarus are now under EU restrictive measures. The United States, Britain and Canada also slapped sanctions on 
senior Belarus officials. (Ad) Big Pharma doesn't want to CURE depression. The longer we stay depressed, the 
more money they make. But one new company is changing all that.  
EU slaps economic sanctions on Belarus over rights breaches
 The foreign ministers also flagged the economic sanctions that were approved Thursday. German Foreign Minister 
Heiko Maas said they would take aim at "economic areas that are of particular significance for Belarus and for the 
regime's income.' 
 That provoked an angry reaction from Belarus, with the country's foreign ministry saying they would hurt ordinary 
people and 'border on the declaration of an economic war.' The ministry warned the country would be forced to take 
retaliatory measures that would hurt Western companies. 
 Belarus has been shaken by months of protests fueled by Lukashenko's re-election. The authorities responded 
with a massive crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police. Most 
opposition leaders have been jailed or forced to leave the country. 
 Since he was pulled off the Ryanair flight in Minsk, Pratasevich has been paraded on state TV, tearfully apologizing 
for his actions and praising Lukashenko. 
 His parents, members of the opposition and others in the West believe he spoke under duress, with some saying 
there were signs he had been beaten.

7 Stocks to Buy Now and Avoid a Summer Swoon[2] Summer is generally a quiet time in the markets. Institutional 
investors, generally speaking, take some time away. In fact, that's where the idiom 'Sell in May and Go Away' 
comes from. 
 But quiet doesn't mean uneventful. The world still moves along even in the lazy months of summer. And at the 
moment, there are two conflicting views driving the market. 
 One is the fear that everything's a bubble that is just about to burst. We don't recommend you get out of stocks, but 
let's face it, things are more than just a little frothy. 
 But there's another view summarized by the acronym, YOLO (as in You Only Live Once). And these investors are 
committed to keeping the markets going higher. Even if it means going 'all in' (whatever that means to them) on 
risky asset classes like NFTs or Dogecoin. 
 We sincerely hope you take time to recharge (whatever that means to you) this summer. Whatever your personal 
beliefs, the reopening of our economy is a moment that deserves to be celebrated by all of us. But before you do, 
we recommend that you take a peek at these seven stocks that you can consider adding to your portfolio before 
you check out for the summer. These are likely to get as hot as a firecracker on the Fourth of July and should have 
you smiling when the summer ends.

 With the start of the summer travel period, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] is seeing growing passenger numbers 
despite coronavirus-led travel restrictions, per a Reuters report[2]. 
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Ryanair's chief executive officer, Michael O'Leary, stated that bookings 
had significantly recovered over the last eight weeks, with increased number of bookings to Portugal and other 
popular destinations from Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries. 
Per the report, O'Leary said, "Traffic is mushrooming and a lot of that folk are families going on summer holidays to 
the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy." He further added that the airline expected to fly 80-100 million 
passengers in fiscal 2022. Due to travel restrictions and lockdowns imposed by several European governments, the 
airline carried a mere 27.5 million passengers in fiscal 2021, compared with 149 million in fiscal 2020. Ryanair

More airlines on Wednesday joined legal action against the Britain over its travel curbs, adding to pressure on the 
government to relax restrictions that are putting businesses and jobs on the line.
EasyJet and tour group TUI said they had joined the action led by Manchester Airports Group (MAG) aimed at 
challenging the government for an alleged lack of transparency over travel rules.
The two airlines join the country's other biggest travel firms Ryanair, British Airways-owner IAG and Virgin Atlantic 
as interested parties in the case.
A spokesman for MAG, the claimant in the case, said the court had accepted its application for an expedited 
hearing and the government, specifically the transport minister and the health minister, had until Monday to file a 
defense.
"We cannot comment on legal proceedings," said a government spokesperson.
A date for a hearing is likely to be set either later next week or for the following the week, added the spokesperson.
The travel industry remains effectively closed as rules require 10 days quarantine for arrivals from all European 
Union countries and the United States. Government advice also warns against traveling to most countries.
British pilots, cabin crew, travel agents and other workers are urging politicians to reopen foreign routes with 
protests and demonstrations across the country on Wednesday.
The government said in an emailed response its travel rules sought to balance the reopening of international travel 
with safeguarding public health and protecting the country's vaccine program.

Malta and the Balearic Islands may be the only two additions to the UK's green list in Thursday's update.
It means that from Tuesday 29 June, travellers from these destinations won't have to quarantine for ten days once 
they arrive in the UK.
READ: End to quarantine for vaccinated travellers under consideration, says Hancock
Opening up the Spanish islands will be welcome from the travel industry, as 5mln Britons used to visit Ibiza, 
Mallorca and Menorca each year before the pandemic.
Ministers are considering just a "handful" of changes, The Times reported, after the end of lockdown in England 
was postponed from 21 June to 19 July.
Some Caribbean islands may also make it to the green list, but other popular European destinations won't be added 
until next month.
It's understood that UK residents who have received both jabs will be able to avoid quarantine when returning from 
abroad from August onwards.
Ryanair (LON:RYA) added 2% to (EURO)16.68 in the late morning, easyJet (LON:EZJ) advanced 1% to 989.2p 
and TUI (LON:TUI) remained flat at 400.3p.

The United States on Monday (21 June) imposed sanctions on more than a dozen Belarusian individuals and 
entities, the US Treasury Department said, joining Britain, Canada and the European Union in applying pressure for 
human rights abuses and the erosion of democracy, writes Daphne Psaledakis, Reuters. 
Belarus plunged into crisis last year when street protests erupted over what demonstrators said was a rigged 
presidential election. 
Veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko has so far ridden out the storm with a crackdown. His grounding last month 
of a commercial airliner and arrest of a dissident blogger on board drew Western outrage. 
The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it blacklisted 16 people and five entities in response to the 
Lukashenko government's "escalating violence and repression, including its reckless forced diversion of a 
commercial Ryanair flight and arrest of journalist Raman Pratasevich." 
"The United States and its partners will not tolerate continued attacks on democracy and the ceaseless repression 
of independent voices in Belarus," Andrea Gacki, director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said in 
the statement. 
Monday's action targeted close associates of Lukashenko, the Treasury said, including his press secretary and the 
chairperson of the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly, the Belarusian Parliament's upper house.

Also blacklisted were individuals and entities the Treasury accused of playing a role in the crackdown on peaceful 
protesters following the August presidential election. 
Those hit with sanctions include: the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus, the Internal Troops of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus and the Main Directorate for Combating Organized Crime and 
Corruption of the MVD of the Republic of Belarus. 
Mikalai Karpiankou, Belarus' deputy minister of internal affairs and the current commander of the internal troops, 
was also hit with sanctions, as was prosecutor general Andrei Ivanavich Shved.

 The United States, the European Union and Britain imposed sweeping sanctions on Belarusian entities and 
officials on Monday (21 June) and called on Minsk "to end its repressive practices against its own people", write 
Robin Emmott and Sabine Siebold, Reuters. 
The allies together with Canada also told the administration of President Alexander Lukashenko to cooperate with 
investigations into the forced landing of a Ryanair jet there in May and the arrest of a reporter and his girlfriend on 
board. 
The coordinated action reflected growing Western frustration over Belarus which plunged into crisis last year when 
street protests erupted over what demonstrators said was a rigged presidential election. 
There was no immediate reaction from Lukashenko who has so far ridden out the storm with a crackdown, denied 
rigging the vote and accused the journalist Raman Pratasevich of plotting a revolution. 
The veteran leader has increasingly turned to Russia for support. 
The European Union said it was imposing travel bans and asset freezes on 78 officials and entities including the 
Belarusian defence and transport minister and its air force commander as well as judges and lawmakers. 
The bloc said it was also drawing up economic sanctions that Austria said would "tighten the thumbscrews" on the 
Belarusian government. 
The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it blacklisted 16 people and five entities in response to the 
Lukashenko government's "escalating violence and repression," including nthe forced landing of the flight. Read

US, EU and Britain slap sanctions on Belarus officials and companies
The U.S. action targeted close associates of Lukashenko, the Treasury said, including his press secretary and the 
chairperson of the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly, the Belarusian Parliament's upper house. 
Britain said it was adding several senior Belarusian officials and entities, including an exporter of oil products, to its 
sanctions list. 
Belarusian opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya welcomed the announcements. "The European Union 
decided they deserve these sanctions," Tsikhanouskaya told reporters in Brussels. "I agree ... We have to end the 
situation in our country, we don't want it to become North Korea." 
Belarus sovereign dollar bonds tumbled on Monday in response to the announcements. 
The benchmark 2030 bond slumped more than 3 cents - its biggest fall since the global market COVID rout in 
March last year - and the 2031 bond issued in June last year hit a record low, Tradeweb data showed. 
EU states are also soon set to impose economic sanctions on Belarus' financial, oil, tobacco and potash sectors, 
after a provisional deal was agreed on Friday (19 June). Read more[2]. 
The EU imported 1.2 billion euros' ($1.5 billion) worth of chemicals including potash from Belarus last year, as well 
as more than 1 billion euros' worth of crude oil and related products such as fuel and lubricants. Belarus also relies 
on loans from European commercial and development banks. 
"We have to tighten the thumbscrews after this callous action of state air piracy," Austria's Foreign Minister 
Alexander Schaller told reporters in Luxembourgduring a meeting with his EU counterparts. "We want to hit the 
state-affiliated economic sector, those responsible, not the people in Belarus, who are suffering anyway." 
While the economic sanctions still need to be finalised to withstand any court challenge, Bordello said EU leaders 
would discuss giving political approval at a summit on Thursday. 
Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Assembler said it was up to the EU to show that "state terror has no place in 
the 21st century". 
Restrictions on the Belarusian financial sector are set to include: a ban on new loans, a ban on EU investors from 
buying bonds on the primary market and a ban on EU banks from providing investment services. EU export credits 
will also end, although private savings will not be targeted. Securities in circulation and traded between fund 
managers are not expected to be hit, but sanctions on the secondary market could come at a later stage. 
The bloc will ban exports to Belarus of any communications equipment that could be used for spying, and tighten an 
arms embargo to include rifles used by biathletes, officials said.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said bookings for holidays are gaining pace 
"very strongly," Reuters reported Wednesday. 
The budget airline's CEO said that in the last eight weeks, holidaymakers have increased demand from regions 
such as the Benelux and Scandinavia, as well as Germany. 
O'Leary said demand for the UK and Ireland is growing more slowly because of "political cowardice," instead of 
from concerns about the delta variant, although he showed confidence that the UK will join in a system similar to the 
EU digital certificate, which is due to enter into application on July 1.
Shares in Ryanair were marginally higher on Wednesday afternoon.

The government is working on a plan to allow fully vaccinated people to travel more freely, Health Secretary Matt 
Hancock said today in an apparent contradiction of comments from Boris Johnson yesterday.
Hancock told Sky News the plans are not yet finalised though the Times reported that an announcement might 
come as soon as Thursday with fully vaccinated travellers no longer having to quarantine for ten days after visiting 
an amber list country.
"It is absolutely something we're working on - it's something I want to see," Hancock said.
Shares in the airlines rose on the reports even though Boris Johnson had warned yesterday travellers face a 
difficult year and "there would be hassle".
Airline bosses have been outspoken critics of the government's traffic light system, especially following the addition 
of Portugal to the amber list earlier this month.
Spain, France, Italy and Greece are also on the amber list, which requires tend days of self-isolation and Covid-19 
tests before travel and on days two and eight after returning
Airlines launch legal challenge.
End to quarantine for vaccinated travellers under consideration, says Hancock
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has repeatedly called for a vaccine-based approach and has started legal action to 
get changes to the systems pointing out the UK has overseen one of the most successful vaccine roll-outs with 80% 
of adults receiving at least one shot.
TUI AG (LON:TUI) said today it was joining the legal action with travel association ABTA also considering whether 
to sign up. 
Virgin Atlantic, British Airways's parent company IAG, and the Manchester Airport Group are already signed up to 
the writ.
Countries in the EU have already started to open up travel arrangements with a digital passport recently agreed that 
will allow fully vaccinated tourists to avoid tests or quarantines.

easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) is poised to benefit from a "retrenchment" among rivals Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, 
according to analysts at Citi.
In a note on Tuesday, the investment bank upgraded the budget carrier to 'neutral' from 'sell', noting that the 
coronavirus pandemic has "altered the landscape" of the European airline industry.
READ: Ryanair, EasyJet 'buys' ahead of travel easing, says HSBC
"The recovery path might vary across the sector", analysts said, although they forecast that supply rationalisation 
will be "the main positive outcome from the pandemic" with "a potential pricing power in the coming years".
"However, on costs the industry is facing structural headwinds such as environmental charges and route charges. 
Against this mixed backdrop, we believe investors should spread their wings across low cost and legacy carriers for 
winners", Citi said.
Aside from their upgrade of easyJet, the bank said they preferred Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) and Wizz Air 
Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) among the low-cost airlines and British Airways owner International Consolidated 
Airlines Group SA (LON:IAG) among legacy carriers.

 Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko Tuesday accused modern Germany of Nazism on the 80th anniversary 
of Hitler's invasion of the USSR and a day after coordinated Western sanctions on his country. 
The EU, US, British and Canadian sanctions were a response to last month's forcible diversion of an international 
flight to Minsk to detain opposition activist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend who were on board. 
Speaking at a World War II commemoration event, the 66-year-old Belarusian president said the sanctions were 
part of an ongoing Western "hybrid war" against his country. 
But "we did not expect Germany's participation in this collective conspiracy," he said. 
"From those whose ancestors destroyed not only every third Belarusian, but also millions of unborn children in the 
Great Patriotic War." 
Lukashenko also pointed to the "symbolic" timing of the sanctions on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the German 
invasion of Soviet Russia. 
Addressing German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who called for broad economic sanctions against Belarus on 
Monday, Lukashenko said: "Who are you? A repentant German ... or the heir of the Nazis?" 
 Lukashenko has ruled the ex-Soviet country for nearly three decades and has clamped down on the opposition 
after mass protests erupted following disputed presidential elections last year. 
The Belarusian foreign ministry also denounced the new sanctions earlier Tuesday, while Prime Minister Roman 
Golovchenko said authorities were deliberating over "adequate response measures." 
The European Union and the United States both targeted dozens of individuals and entities over a brutal crackdown 
on the opposition after Lukashenko claimed a landslide re-election for a sixth term last August. 
Brussels and London on Monday added seven officials -- including the defence and transport ministers of Belarus -- 
to their sanctions blacklists for the grounding of the Ryanair jet.

EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg also backed broad-ranging sanctions targeting major revenue sources 
for the Belarusian regime: potash fertiliser exports, the tobacco industry, petroleum and petrochemical products. 
"Deliberate, destructive actions against the population are being continued in order to 'drain the regime financially', 
so to speak," the foreign ministry said in a statement. 
It described the sanctions as "hostile actions" and said Western countries were using "pressure on a sovereign 
state".

"Against this backdrop, the statement of the leadership of the European Union looks like an outright mockery, a 
mockery of logic and common sense," the ministry said. 
It added that Belarus "is able and will do everything possible to protect its citizens and business entities" and the 
restrictions "will not have the desired effect". 
Lukashenko and his allies have already faced a slew of sanctions from Brussels and Washington over the violent 
handling of protests that for months brought tens of thousands of people to the streets. 
Thousands were arrested and several people died while key opposition figures either fled the country or ended up 
in jail. 
Lukashenko's main opponent in the vote was Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a political novice who took the place of her 
jail husband in the poll and quickly gained popularity. 
She was forced into exile to neighbouring EU member Lithuania several days after the protests started. 
The opposition believes Tikhanovskaya was the true winner of the election and she has received the support of 
several Western leaders. 
Lukashenko, however, has so far shrugged off the Western pressure with backing from key ally and creditor Russia.

Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has accused the country's president, Alexander 
Lukashenko, of using political prisoners as "hostages", as the EU announced wide-ranging new sanctions on his 
regime.
Lukashenko has been battling to reassert his control over Belarus since his claim of a landslide victory in a flawed 
election last August triggered the biggest protests in Belarus's independent history.
About 35,000 Belarusians have been arrested in the ensuing crackdown, with many claiming they have been 
tortured. Lukashenko has also targeted the media, forcing Belarus's main independent news portal offline. He 
deployed a fighter jet last month to intercept a Ryanair flight and arrested Roman Protasevich, a dissident who was 
on board.
Tsikhanouskaya described the repression as "Stalin-like", the worst that Belarusians had endured since 
Lukashenko came to power in 1994, three years after the country declared independence from the USSR.
"We could never imagine that the regime could be so cruel. Of course, in the past we had oppression of 
demonstrations, but we never had so many people [being arrested].

"People are really scared. They are frightened to go outside, to live," the exiled leader said.
"The regime is now collecting as many hostages as possible to trade in exchange for lifting sanctions."
Foreign ministers from the European bloc yesterday slapped asset freezes and travel bans on eight entities and 78 
individuals in Belarus, including the defence minister and transport minister. The bloc has already imposed similar 
measures against scores of other officials, including Lukashenko.
The EU set their sights on industries including finance, potash and petro- leum products. The US, UK and Canada 
also announced additional sanctions against Belarus officials and entities in a move co-ordinated with Brussels in 
an attempt to force the regime to "end its repressive practices against its own people".
Josep Borrell, EU foreign policy chief, said the sanctions would "hurt the economy of Belarus heavily". Heiko Maas, 
Germany's foreign minister, said the areas targeted were "of particular significance for Belarus and for the regime's 
income".
Tsikhanouskaya said it was important the measures were rolled out in force. "If the sanctions are imposed step by 
step, it's easier for the regime to find ways out," she said. "But if they are imposed in one go, it's much more difficult 
to evade them."
The latest round of sanctions was triggered by the detention of Protasevich, who infuriated Lukashenko by playing a 
big role in reporting on and co-ordinating last year's protests.
Since his arrest, Protasevich - he was seen with apparent bruises on his face and livid marks on his wrists - has 
been paraded by the regime at a series of recordings and press conferences in which he praised Lukashenko.
Tsikhanouskaya condemned Lukashenko's actions, saying he was acting out of "hatred" and fear of change in 
Belarus. She said it was clear Protasevich had been speaking under duress.
"Roman is in danger," she added. "His task is to survive www.there.No one can understand, especially people in 
democratic countries, how people are threatened [in Belarusian prisons]. It's immoral even to discuss the content of 
these press conferences or these interviews. We have to discuss how to release him, and that is it."
Human rights groups say there are more than 500 political prisoners in Belarus as a result of Lukashenko's 
crackdown.
Among them is Tsikhanouskaya's husband, Siarhei, who was detained last year, thwarting his plans to run against 
Lukashenko for the presidency. He is due to face a closed hearing later this week along with several other 
dissidents, including the blogger Ihar Losik. Tsikhanouskaya said it was unclear what would happen at the hearing, 
given the captured nature of Belarus's judicial system.
She renewed her call for the release of all political prisoners, adding that the EU should not relax sanctions before 
this had been achieved.
Tsikhanouskaya said that the only way out of Belarus's political crisis was for a fresh, free and fair vote to be held.

 Lawmakers have praised wide-ranging sanctions against the Lukashenko regime, with Germany's foreign minister 
saying "the EU has delivered." Minsk has vowed to protect its citizens and business from the "hostile actions."EU 
figures admire Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn for his directness. And he didn't hold back after 
Monday's decision to target key sectors of the Belarus economy with fresh sanctions. 
"We are clearly showing that Stalinism and state terror no longer have a place in the 21st century," said Asselborn, 
referring to Minsk's forced diversion of a Ryanair passenger plane and detention of a dissident journalist in May.  
He had previously said that any sanctions imposed on the country must "hurt" the regime of President Alexander 
Lukashenko. 
The new economic sanctions will target seven sectors dominated by state-run companies that are believed to play a 
pivotal role in buoying Lukashenko's regime. These include the potash and fertilizer industries, two of the country's 
biggest export products; Belarus is the world's second-largest producer of potash. 
The sanctions will also target the petrochemical and tobacco industries, financial services and dual-use goods, such 
as surveillance technology, so far exempt from the existing arms embargo. High-ranking officials now also face 
asset freezes and are barred from entering and transiting though the EU. Some 160 individuals will be affected by 
this measure. 
The United Kingdom, the United States and Canada have joined the EU sanctions plan, which should amplify its 
effect. 
Minsk condemns 'hostile actions' 
On Tuesday, Belarus said the measures amounted to "economic war'' and threatened to retaliate. 
"We have repeatedly stated that sanctions negatively affect the interests of citizens, they are counterproductive and 
vicious," the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, describing the sanctions as "hostile actions."  
It added that Belarus "is able and will do everything possible to protect its citizens and business entities" and the 
restrictions "will not have the desired effect." 
But exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who had been calling for hash sanctions against the 
regime, expressed satisfaction with the coordinated EU effort.  
EU sanctions on Belarus go 'beyond symbolic'
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also praised the outcome, saying "the EU has delivered." Maas said EU 
sanctions will deal a serious blow to Belarus' state-run companies and "dry up" the regime's money supply. 
Petras Austrevicius, a Lithuanian member of the European Parliament, told DW that the sanctions will send "very 
powerful and even timely message to the regime." The lawmaker expects the EU to find new ways to support the 
Belarussian civil society, which he said still urgently needs the EU's backing. 
Austria fears an economic hit 
When EU figures met last week in Brussels for talks regarding the potential sanctions, Austria seemed reluctant to 
impose the punitive measures. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, however, later denied the 
objections, saying Vienna was now taking a strong stand against the regime. 
"We have to tighten the thumbscrews after this callous action of state air piracy," Schallenberg told reporters on 
Monday. "We want to hit the state-affiliated economic sector, those responsible, not the people in Belarus, who are 
suffering anyway." 
Schallenberg stressed, however, that the sanctions would have to stand up in court, as the European Court of 
Justice has been called upon to previously assess the legality of such measures. 
The reason for Austria's apparent resistance to tougher sanctions? Some 80 Austrian companies have close 
business ties to Belarus, and would likely be adversely affected by any harsh economic measures. Austria is the 
second-biggest source of foreign direct investment in the country after Russia. Austrian banks — chiefly a 
subsidiary of Raiffeisen Bank International — provide 80% of foreign loans. In addition, the country's mobile 
network operator A1 Telekom Austria operates the Belarusian telecommunications network. 
EU 'speaking the language of power' 
Reinhard Bütikofer, an EU lawmaker with the Greens and the group's foreign affairs spokesperson, said the bloc 
had done well to go beyond symbolic measures to adopt "serious sanctions" to deter other states. 
Bütikofer said the sanctions would require EU member states to make certain concessions. "You cannot cook an 
omelet without breaking eggs," he said. He added that further measures, such as excluding Belarus from the 
SWIFT banking system, could be imposed if needed. By and large, however, the MEP expressed satisfaction that 
the EU was now "speaking the language of power." 
Belarus opposition leader Tsikhanouskaya, however, warned the EU that the Lukashenko regime may attempt to 
entice Europe into doing business with it in exchange for freeing political prisoners. Speaking on Monday, she once 
again highlighted the dangers faced by the country's pro-democracy movement, showing a bullet fragment that had 
been removed from a protester's lung — the young activist had been shot by Belarussian police while attending a 
demonstration. 
The center-right European People's Party, meanwhile, has called for an international tribunal to try Lukashenko for 
crimes against humanity. Party leader Manfred Weber recently drew attention to the fact that Minsk is allegedly 
sending migrants from places like Iraq and Syria into Lithuania to exert pressure on the Baltic state, which has long 
supported the Belarus opposition. 
Weber said he welcomed the mobilization of Frontex agents in the area, saying on Twitter that Lukashenko would 
not get to decide which migrants may or may not enter the EU.

 TUI (TUI.L) joined several airlines including Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) in suing the UK government over 
its traffic light travel restrictions, according to media reports Tuesday.
Andrew Flintham, managing director of the travel giant, said it was "inexplicable" that the government did not move 
destinations like Malta, the Greek islands and the Balearics, which have lower COVID-19 rates, to the green list but 
added Portugal to its amber list.
Ryanair and the Manchester Airports Group earlier sued the government, demanding further clarity on its decision 
to add and remove countries from lists. International Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG.L, IAG.MC) British Airways 
and Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic later joined the suit.

 [Sava Jankovic, MA (University of Warsaw), MSc (Warsaw University of Technology), PhD (University of Dundee) 
is Researcher at the Institute of Legal Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences. His interests include the law of 
statehood, international responsibility, human rights law and peaceful resolution of conflicts.] 
The aftermath of the incident: Proceedings before national and international bodies and politically charged 
sanctions 
The Ryanair forced landing incident provoked both questions of potential Belarus's responsibility under national and 
international laws and ways of executing it. In addition, a debate over the sanctions emerged, in particular, whether 
they were taken not prematurely (before establishing the actual violation by a judicial or para-judicial body) and 
whether they were not too severe.  
The ICAO's probe 
To start with the first set of issues, there are a few possible ways of examining the incident and bringing to justice 
those responsible. The foremost avenue is obviously within the organization concerned with civil aviation, namely 
the International Civil Aviation Organization. 
In accordance with Article 54 of this Chicago Convention, the incident, upon referral by any contracting State, must 
be clarified by the ICAO Council - one of the governing bodies of this structure (the second is the Assembly). The 
Council is obliged to ask the Belarusian government to make a statement, and then report to the Assembly about 
this incident and its reasons, and then, if the ICAO Assembly sees it fit, it can impose sanctions on Belarus, issue a 
reprimand or make some other decision. Recalling Article 55 (e) of the Chicago Convention, the ICAO's 
Councildecided[1]at its urgent videoconference meeting on 27 of May to undertake a fact-finding investigation of 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius : 
Part II
this event, and in this connection requested the ICAO Secretariat to prepare an interim report to the Council. 
Belarusian Director of the Aviation Department, who participated in the meeting, 'urged[2]to conduct a fact-finding 
investigation in accordance with the Chicago Convention and to refrain from making conclusions until such 
investigation is complete'. 
Nevertheless, Belarus, in order to defend its statement on a suspected bomb, will have to prove it, provide specific 
data: what kind of information it was, from whom it came. To say that they got it from the special services would not 
be enough. And if Belarus has nothing to put on the table to confirm its version, it will have a hard time. According 
to the German air lawexpert[3], Elmar Giemulla, it is very likely that the Assembly will issue a warning to Belarus 
that in case of a repetition of such an incident, the country will be excluded from ICAO. It would be rash on the part 
of the Belarusian government not to listen to this, because if it happens a second time, they will no longer have a 
chance. And the exclusion from ICAO means that it will be extremely difficult for the country to carry out 
international air transportation. 
National investigations 
National law enforcement institutions are likewise capable of launching the investigation into the incident. In 
Belarus, the Investigative Committee branch of Minsk's Oktyabrsky District haslaunched[4]a criminal case into 'a 
knowingly false report about danger in line with part 1, Article 340 of the Criminal Code'. In Poland, legal 
proceedings have beeninitiated[5]by the Prosecutor General of Poland under Articles 166 (suspicion of a crime) and 
189 (the use of deception and threats to take control of an aircraft and imprisonment) of the Polish penal code. The 
Lithuanian public prosecutor's office opened a pre-trial investigation under Article 251 'Hijacking an Aircraft' and 
Article 100 'Treatment of Persons Prohibited under International Law' of the Lithuanian criminal code. Furthermore, 
the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)leads[6]an independent enquiry, while closely liaising with the Polish 
and Lithuanian authorities, given the US passengers were present on board. The multiplicity of currently conducted 
national probes, as well as those to be potentially initiated by the interested parties (the flight commenced in 
Greece, the company is Irish), only seemingly facilitates the investigation. In reality, criminal jurisdiction issue will 
undoubtedly arise among all involved, and proper communication, including with the ICAO and Interpol will be 
required. 
Avenues for international litigation 
In addition to solving the dispute by the ICAO bodies, unsatisfied parties may, pursuant to Article 84 of the Chicago 
Convention, forward the case to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal agreed upon with the other parties or to the ICJ. This 
would, of course, pertain exclusively to the breach of the aforementioned Article 3bis (b) of the Chicago Convention. 
In reference to utilizing the ICJ in the instance of providing false information by the Air Traffic Control, prohibited by 
Article 1(1)(e) of the Montreal Convention linked to the positive obligation of not providing such information under 
Article 10 (for instance, taking due measures to verify it), the avenue isipso jureclosed for other Parties, as Belarus 
placed a reservation to Article 14 of the Montreal Convention, allowing for use of the adjudication in case of 
potential disagreements. A furtherpossibility[7]of legal action arises from the violation of the rights of the flag state of 
the aircraft (in this case Poland), who should have been asked for permission or extradition of the sought people by 
the Belorussian state, however, it seems unlikely due to form of security operation. 
(Dis)proportionally severe sanctions 
Western countries, disinclined to be entangled in rather long and perhaps even uncertain legal processes, harried 
with unilateral (or alliance) sanctions. However, this could be perceived as arbitrary administration of law, given that 
neither national nor international investigations have not been completed. Many EU countries decided to close their 
airspace to the Belorussian aero transport, which was evidenced on 26 of May when Belavia plane from Minsk to 
Barcelona turned back just before reaching Poland. Forbidding the national carrier to enter another state's airspace 
must be preceded by withdrawing the consent to fly by suspension of a bilateral or multilateral agreement, yet 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius : 
Part II
usually by issuingNOTAM[8]. Closing the airspace is naturally a sovereigndecision[9]of states, as there is no 
similarity to the law of sea's 'free passage' principle, yet can be considered as an act deteriorating international 
relations. Still, the Chicago Convention in Article 87 foresees a penalty in the form of not allowing the operation of 
an airline of a contracting State in the airspace of other states only if the airline concerned is not conforming to a 
final decision of the Council. In 2018, the ICJruled[10]that the ICAO is a responsible organization for regulating civil 
air traffic over contracting States and backed Qatar's endeavour to declare the blockage of its airspace by the 
surrounding Arab states contrary to international law and to demand financial compensation. 
A further set of sanctions relates to encouraging EU carriers not to use the Belorussian airspace, which may have 
devastating effects for the economy given that Belarus receivesincome[11]from airlines that enter its airspace of up 
to €70,000 (60,000) each day. In addition, a three-billion-euro EU investment package for Belarus wasfrozen[12]in 
connection to the incident and the USre-imposed[13]full blocking sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned 
enterprises previously granted relief under a series of General Licenses by the Treasury Department. All in all, the 
economic impact of the sanctions is great, but the sanctions' effects on human rights, in particular, of the 
Byelorussians, issignificant[14]too. It might be argued that the inflicted sanctions are disproportionate to the scale of 
the incident and were determined largely by the pursued geopolitical agenda of bringing down the Lukashenko 
regime. In other words, the primary reason for such severe sanctions is rather the repression of the opposition than 
merely the air incident (the pane, after all, continued its flight to Vilnius). Three main arguments substantiate this 
thesis a) the history of sanctions imposed on the Lukashenko regime for the 'mistreatment' of the opposition, b) the 
very political statements, which make it clear that the geopolitical agenda is at stake, and c) the inaction of the 
Western world in more grave situations, exposing larger violations of human rights. 
Regarding the first argument, it is evident that whenever opposition activists are targeted in Belarus, an immediate 
harsh reaction follows from the Western world. In 2004, an embargo on arms was imposed by the EU as a result of 
the disappearance of two opposition politicians. In 2020, a travel ban and asset freeze against 88 individuals and 
seven organisations wereinstituted[15]by the EU in relation to the 'intimidation of peaceful demonstrators' and 
allegedly forged presidential elections. 
With reference to the second argument, the initial harsh language of unprecedented act of'state terrorism'[16]or 
effective 'aviation piracy, state sponsored[17]' was soon supplemented with the accusations ofharassments[18]of 
journalists and 'shockingassault[19]on human rights and freedom of the press'. The EU Council'sconclusions[20]of 
24 May not only 'strongly condemn the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, on 23 May 2021 
endangering aviation safety' but also 'demand the immediate release of Raman Pratasevich' (co-founder of the 
opposition Nexta channel on Telegram, used for mobilising street protests) and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
Thestatement[21]by the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki of 28 of May is clothed in an akin political accent 
as it, apart from calling for a 'credible international investigation into the events of May 23', demands 'immediately 
release all political prisoners, and enter into a comprehensive and genuine political dialogue with the leaders of the 
democratic opposition and civil society groups that leads to the conduct of free and fair Presidential elections under 
OSCE auspices and monitoring'. 
As per the third argument, that is, the incomparably heighten reaction of the Western leaders to the current incident 
than to other even more serious occurrences, one could mention the downing of a Ukrainian commercial airliner by 
Iran in 2020, which went largely unsanctionedand unremedied, asobserved[22]by the UN Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. In the same vein, the Belarusian incident brought about considerably 
aggrandized consequences for the regime than to those responsible for the recent Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which 
involvedbloodshed[23]and massive infrastructuredestructions[24]. 
Having said that, although the safety and comfort of the passengers of the Ryaianr flight 4978 could have been 
important for the Western leaders as well as that the fact that similar incidents (including justifications) do not repeat 
in other parts of the world, it is the democratic values of the freedom of speech, media and thought, which greatly fit 
within the agenda of ousting the 'undemocratic' Lukashenko regime, that underpin the sanctions policy. Thus, the 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius : 
Part II
sanctions could be considered disproportionate to the incident, yet proportionate to broader politically envisaged 
goals. The question, however, remains how effective the sanction policy will be in the long run, what will be the 
response of Russia, and whether in the end, it will lead to the desired or contra effects. 
Conclusion 
The situation surrounding the incident of an 'emergency' landing of the Ryanair flight 4978in Minsk on 23 of May 
2021 has more political than legal overtones. It could be inferred from the most plausible motive for grounding the 
plane by the Belorussian government as well as from the reaction of the Western world thereto. International law, 
on its side, was used as an instrument for justifying and denouncing the grounding, whichnota bene,is generally the 
case when a scandal of such dimensions erupts. From what we know so far,the whole action was most likely 
politically motivated - it is hard to believe that Belorus would deliberately place on itself the burden of a security 
operation, especially that the plane almost reached its destination in Lithuania. In that regard, Belorus breached 
international law, in particular the Montreal Convention. It, however, remains debatable whether the action of 
grounding the plane apart from being an uncommon or unfriendly act would also be illegal, had Belarus not 
provided purportedly false information on the bomb, but explained its action in terms of arresting the fugitive sought 
for serious offences, who found himself within the confines of state's criminal jurisdiction. We seem to lack a firm 
legal stance on that and such clarification would be more than welcome on this occasion from the ICAO Council or 
later by an authoritative body engaged with international law. This is essential for the unencumbered air transit, 
security of the passengers, friendship and understanding among nations and, most notably, order in international 
civil aviation. Potential future litigation of the incident will undoubtedly be cumbersome due to the limited legal 
avenues and complicated fact-checking task. Irrespective of the potential litigation, the incident will be used by 
Belorus and the West to carry out their political agendas. For Belorus, it means the maintenance of power by all 
available means, mainly based on suppressing the opposition. For the West, it means the continuation of toppling 
the Lukashenko regime, by imposing very severe sanctions.

Jun 22, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 Lawmakers have praised wide-ranging sanctions against the Lukashenko regime, with Germany's foreign minister 
saying "the EU has delivered." Minsk has vowed to protect its citizens and business from the "hostile actions."EU 
figures admire Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn for his directness. And he didn't hold back after 
Monday's decision to target key sectors of the Belarus economy with fresh sanctions. 
"We are clearly showing that Stalinism and state terror no longer have a place in the 21st century," said Asselborn, 
referring to Minsk's forced diversion of a Ryanair passenger plane and detention of a dissident journalist in May.  
He had previously said that any sanctions imposed on the country must "hurt" the regime of President Alexander 
Lukashenko. 
The new economic sanctions will target seven sectors dominated by state-run companies that are believed to play a 
pivotal role in buoying Lukashenko's regime. These include the potash and fertilizer industries, two of the country's 
biggest export products; Belarus is the world's second-largest producer of potash. 
The sanctions will also target the petrochemical and tobacco industries, financial services and dual-use goods, such 
as surveillance technology, so far exempt from the existing arms embargo. High-ranking officials now also face 
asset freezes and are barred from entering and transiting though the EU. Some 160 individuals will be affected by 
this measure. 
The United Kingdom, the United States and Canada have joined the EU sanctions plan, which should amplify its 
effect. 
Minsk condemns 'hostile actions' 
On Tuesday, Belarus said the measures amounted to "economic war'' and threatened to retaliate. 
"We have repeatedly stated that sanctions negatively affect the interests of citizens, they are counterproductive and 
vicious," the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said in a statement, describing the sanctions as "hostile actions."  
It added that Belarus "is able and will do everything possible to protect its citizens and business entities" and the 
restrictions "will not have the desired effect." 
But exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who had been calling for hash sanctions against the 
regime, expressed satisfaction with the coordinated EU effort.  
EU sanctions on Belarus go 'beyond symbolic'
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also praised the outcome, saying "the EU has delivered." Maas said EU 
sanctions will deal a serious blow to Belarus' state-run companies and "dry up" the regime's money supply. 
Petras Austrevicius, a Lithuanian member of the European Parliament, told DW that the sanctions will send "very 
powerful and even timely message to the regime." The lawmaker expects the EU to find new ways to support the 
Belarussian civil society, which he said still urgently needs the EU's backing. 
Austria fears an economic hit 
When EU figures met last week in Brussels for talks regarding the potential sanctions, Austria seemed reluctant to 
impose the punitive measures. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, however, later denied the 
objections, saying Vienna was now taking a strong stand against the regime. 
"We have to tighten the thumbscrews after this callous action of state air piracy," Schallenberg told reporters on 
Monday. "We want to hit the state-affiliated economic sector, those responsible, not the people in Belarus, who are 
suffering anyway." 
Schallenberg stressed, however, that the sanctions would have to stand up in court, as the European Court of 
Justice has been called upon to previously assess the legality of such measures. 
The reason for Austria's apparent resistance to tougher sanctions? Some 80 Austrian companies have close 
business ties to Belarus, and would likely be adversely affected by any harsh economic measures. Austria is the 
second-biggest source of foreign direct investment in the country after Russia. Austrian banks — chiefly a 
subsidiary of Raiffeisen Bank International — provide 80% of foreign loans. In addition, the country's mobile 
network operator A1 Telekom Austria operates the Belarusian telecommunications network. 
EU 'speaking the language of power' 
Reinhard Bütikofer, an EU lawmaker with the Greens and the group's foreign affairs spokesperson, said the bloc 
had done well to go beyond symbolic measures to adopt "serious sanctions" to deter other states. 
Bütikofer said the sanctions would require EU member states to make certain concessions. "You cannot cook an 
omelet without breaking eggs," he said. He added that further measures, such as excluding Belarus from the 
SWIFT banking system, could be imposed if needed. By and large, however, the MEP expressed satisfaction that 
the EU was now "speaking the language of power." 
Belarus opposition leader Tsikhanouskaya, however, warned the EU that the Lukashenko regime may attempt to 
entice Europe into doing business with it in exchange for freeing political prisoners. Speaking on Monday, she once 
again highlighted the dangers faced by the country's pro-democracy movement, showing a bullet fragment that had 
been removed from a protester's lung — the young activist had been shot by Belarussian police while attending a 
demonstration. 
The center-right European People's Party, meanwhile, has called for an international tribunal to try Lukashenko for 
crimes against humanity. Party leader Manfred Weber recently drew attention to the fact that Minsk is allegedly 
sending migrants from places like Iraq and Syria into Lithuania to exert pressure on the Baltic state, which has long 
supported the Belarus opposition. 
Weber said he welcomed the mobilization of Frontex agents in the area, saying on Twitter that Lukashenko would 
not get to decide which migrants may or may not enter the EU.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada joined forces Monday to impose 
sanctions on several senior officials in Belarus over the forced diversion to Minsk of a passenger plane travelling 
between two EU countries last month.
Asset freezes and travel bans were also imposed on a number of officials linked to the security crackdown that 
continues to rock the country some 10 months after President Alexander Lukashenko was returned to power in 
elections branded by the EU and others as “fraudulent.”
“We are united in our deep concern regarding the Lukashenko regime’s continuing attacks on human rights, 
fundamental freedoms, and international law,” the four said in a joint statement.
“We are committed to support the long-suppressed democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus and we stand 
together to impose costs on the regime for its blatant disregard of international commitments,” they said.
The EU hit seven people and one entity over the “forced and unlawful” landing of the Ryanair plane, which was 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania when it was ordered to stop in Minsk, where authorities arrested Raman 
Pratasevich, a dissident journalist who was one of the passengers.
The four called on Minsk to cooperate with an international probe into the incident, immediately release all political 
prisoners, and “enter into a comprehensive and genuine political dialogue” with the democratic opposition and civil 
society.
Among those targeted by the United States were close Lukashenko associates, those accused of helping to 
violently suppress peaceful protests since last year and others alleged to have orchestrated fraud during the 
elections.
At a meeting in Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers also prepared a series of economic measures that are aimed at 
hitting Lukashenko and his allies. EU leaders are expected to endorse them at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.
EU, US, UK, Canada join forces to slap sanctions on Belarus
The EU has gradually ratcheted up sanctions since Lukashenko – dubbed the last dictator in Europe – won a sixth 
term last August.
But the 27-nation bloc has taken a harder approach since the Ryanair incident, and over the country's alleged use 
of migrants to pressure neighboring Lithuania, which has provided a safe-haven to Belarusian opposition figures 
and is one of Lukashenko’s most vocal critics.
Among their actions Monday, the ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 78 Belarus officials and froze 
the assets of 8 “entities,” which are usually companies, banks, or associations. It means that a total of 166 people 
and 15 entities are now under EU restrictive measures.
“This decision was made in view of the escalation of serious human rights violations in Belarus and the violent 
repression of civil society, democratic opposition and journalists,” a statement said.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who chaired the meeting, said the economic sanctions “are going to hurt ... 
the economy of Belarus heavily.”
The measures are likely to include action against the export of potash – a common fertilizer ingredient – tobacco 
industry exports and petroleum products, among others.
“We will no longer just sanction individuals. We will now also impose sectoral sanctions -- meaning that we will now 
get to work on the economic areas that are of particular significance for Belarus and for the regime’s income,” 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.
“We want to make very, very clear to Lukashenko that there is no going back," Maas said.
Maas said the 27 EU countries stand united on sanctions “We are really very, very determined not to budge, not 
just today -- nothing about this will change in the coming weeks and months,” he said.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said EU countries had thought only a month ago that it still 
might be possible to reason with Lukashenko but that "the mood is different now.”
Landsbergis accused Minsk of “weaponizing” migration flows. He said around 500 people are sheltering in 
Lithuania, most from Iraq, and that Belarus border guards brought 30 refugees to the border in recent days. He said 
Lithuania has limited capacity for them and is building a tent camp.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main opposition challenger who fled Belarus after the vote, welcomed the new 
measures, saying that “the EU and the entire civilized world have set a goal to stop Lukashenko and the escalation 
of violence."
“The EU sanctions would raise not only external, but also internal pressure on Lukashenko ... and will make it more 
costly for his main sponsor, the Kremlin, to maintain the Belarusian regime,” she said.
Tsikhanouskaya said the Ryanair incident shows that “Lukashenko’s regime has become a threat not only to 
citizens of Belarus but also to international security.”

EU foreign ministers agreed on Monday to slap their toughest punitive measures yet on Belarus, a package of 
economic sanctions targeting sectors that benefit the government of President Alexander Lukashenko.
The agreement, struck at a meeting in Luxembourg and confirmed to dpa by two diplomatic sources, follows weeks 
of tough negotiations over which economic actors to hit.
Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said a total of seven cash cow areas will be hit, including tobacco, 
potash - a potassium-rich salt used in fertilizer - petroleum products and financial services.
"I think these are sanctions that will hurt. And I hope they hurt so much that they bring the regime to its knees," 
Asselborn told journalists before the meeting.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said the move would "contribute to financially drying out the regime."
It is the bloc's latest response to the forced landing of a Ryanair flight and the arrest of a Belarusian dissident 
blogger last month. The EU already sealed off its airspace to carriers from its eastern neighbour.
The punitive measures - which aim to tighten the vice on the authoritarian government of Lukashenko and 
strengthen his opponents - must still be formally adopted, but their basic remit is now fixed.
However, it is unclear exactly they will be implemented, according to Asselborn. "We need a bit of time to translate 
this into reality."
The bloc is also set to blacklist dozens more individuals or organizations that support Lukashenko on Monday, 
adding to the close to 90 targets already subject EU travel bans or asset freezes.
EU ministers agree on major Belarusian economic sanctions package
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has been calling for tough EU measures, also spoke 
with the ministers in Luxembourg.
"Sanctions aren't a silver bullet, but they can help to end violence and release people," she tweeted.
Tikhanovskaya currently lives in exile in Lithuania. She is considered by many to be the winner of the disputed 
presidential election of August 9, 2020, after which Lukashenko had himself proclaimed president again.
The EU no longer recognizes him as head of state and claims the poll was neither nor fair.
The bloc has been calling for the release of Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, both of whom were 
detained after being hauled off the Vilnius-bound Ryanair flight, along with hundreds of political prisoners.
Most of the targets to be added to the EU blacklist immediately on Monday are accused of helping to repress 
demonstrators, opposition figures or journalists, but others were chosen for a link to the flight diversion.
Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU already adopted several packages 
of sanctions targeting Lukashenko's supporters last year, as well as the president himself.
UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet voiced concern on Monday about a continued deterioration in 
the country highlighting "severe restrictions" to freedom of expression and assembly, worrisome raids on civil 
society and media and judicial persecution of activists and journalists.
"We continue to receive numerous allegations of arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and ill-treatment," she said 
in a statement.
The 66-year-old Lukashenko has led Belarus - a former Soviet republic in Eastern Europe bordering EU states 
Poland, Lithuania and Latvia - for more than a quarter of a century, tolerating little dissent.
Minsk has grown closer to Moscow in recent years. But Lukashenko has also maintained relations with EU partners 
in his almost 27 years in power.

EU foreign ministers have resolved to impose their toughest punitive measures yet on Belarus, a package of 
economic sanctions targeting sectors that benefit the government of President Alexander Lukashenko.
The bloc's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, announced the decision following a Monday meeting in Luxembourg, and 
said he believed they would "put pressure" on Lukashenko. "Certainly, we believe we can influence behaviour."
Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, said a total of seven cash cow areas will be hit, including tobacco, 
potash - a potassium-rich salt used in fertilizer - petroleum products and financial services.
It is the bloc's latest response to Belarusian authorities ongoing crackdown on pro-democratic forces. Tensions 
have spiked further since the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight to detain a government critic and his girlfriend last 
month. The EU already sealed off its airspace to carriers from its eastern neighbour.
"We want the end of violence against protesters and opposition figures and an inclusive dialogue that ultimately 
leads to free and fair elections," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters.
The new measures - which aim to tighten the vice on the authoritarian government of Lukashenko and strengthen 
his opponents - must still be formally adopted, but their basic remit is now fixed.
It is unclear exactly when they will be implemented.
The bloc also imposed fresh sanctions on high-ranking officials and key companies on Monday, coordinating a 
package of measures along with the United States, Canada and Britain.
In total, the EU added 78 individual names to its Belarus blacklist, plus eight institutions or organizations, taking the 
total to 166 persons and 15 entities.
EU settles on economic sanctions to squeeze Belarusian leader
Among the companies affected - according to the entry published in the official EU legal journal - is state-owned 
company BelAZ - one of the biggest manufacturers of large trucks and dumper trucks in the world.
The list also includes the company responsible for controlling air traffic over Belarus.Lukashenko's son Dmitry, 
Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin, other members of the government, and a number of judges are targeted too.In a 
separate statement, London said it had sanctioned, together with the other parties, senior-ranking Belarusian 
officials plus the British-based company BNK, which exports Belarusian oil products.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has been calling for tough EU measures, also met with 
the foreign ministers.
"It's impossible that nothing will change after these sanctions," she told journalists in Brussels.
Tikhanovskaya currently lives in exile in Lithuania. She is considered by many to be the winner of the disputed 
presidential election of August 9, 2020, after which Lukashenko had himself proclaimed president again.
The EU no longer recognizes him as head of state and claims the poll was neither nor fair.
The underlying aim of EU punitive measures is to try and force fresh elections in Belarus.
"They have to understand that there is no other way out," Tikhanovskaya said at a Brussels press conference.
Most of the targets added to the EU blacklist on Monday are accused of helping to repress demonstrators, 
opposition figures or journalists, but others were chosen for a link to the diverted Ryanair flight.
Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU already adopted several packages 
of sanctions targeting Lukashenko's supporters last year, as well as the president himself.

EU foreign ministers meeting Monday in Luxembourg are set to blacklist dozens more supporters of Belarusian 
President Alexander Lukashenko in a bid to tighten the vice on his government and strengthen its opponents.
Seventy-eight individuals are to be hit with measures like EU travel bans or having assets located in the bloc frozen, 
EU sources told dpa last week. At least seven entities such as state institutions or companies are also to be 
targeted, according to the same sources.
The 27 ministers are also to discuss a larger, harder-hitting set of economic sanctions taking aim at cash cow 
sectors. An EU diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said they expect the ministers to come to a "clear 
political agreement" on what these should cover.
Options floated so far have included potash - a potassium-rich salt used to make fertilizer - oil products and 
financial services.
But these won't be ready to implement on Monday, a senior EU official said.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who has called for tough EU measures, is also to speak with 
the ministers in Luxembourg.
Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU has already sanctioned close to 90 
people, including the president himself.
There have been mass protests against Lukashenko ever since an August 2020 presidential election that the EU 
believes was neither free nor fair.
EU foreign ministers set to slap fresh sanctions on Belarus
Last month, Belarusian authorities diverted a Ryanair flight and arrested the government critic Roman Protasevich 
and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
As a result, Belarusian airlines are banned from EU airspace as of early June.
Most of the targets in the sanctions package to be adopted on Monday are accused of helping to repress 
demonstrators, opposition figures or journalists, but others were chosen for a link to the flight diversion.

 The EU, US, Britain and Canada ratcheted up pressure on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko Monday 
by imposing coordinated sanctions after the forced landing of a Ryanair airliner to arrest a regime critic. 
"We are united in our deep concern regarding the Lukashenko regime's continuing attacks on human rights, 
fundamental freedoms, and international law," they said in a joint statement. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the measures "demonstrated the steadfast transatlantic commitment to 
supporting the Belarusian people's democratic aspirations". 
The EU and the US both targeted dozens of individuals and entities over a brutal crackdown on opposition since 
Lukashenko claimed victory in elections last August deemed fraudulent by the West. 
The 27-nation bloc and London added seven officials -- including the defence and transport ministers of Belarus -- 
to their sanctions blacklists for the grounding of the Ryanair jet last month. 
EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg also backed broad-ranging sanctions targeting major revenue sources 
for the Belarusian regime: potash fertiliser exports, the tobacco industry, petroleum and petrochemical products.

severe impact on the Belarusian economy," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. 
"We want the release of the political prisoners, an end to the violence against protesters and the opposition, and an 
inclusive dialogue that will lead to free and fair elections." 
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who insists she won last year's poll, welcomed the joint 
moves from the "democratic community" to strike Belarus. 
"Sanctions are more powerful when they are united," Tikhanovskaya told AFP in an interview in Brussels. 
"It's a clear message to the regime that we are continuing to work together against human rights violence, against 
lawlessness."

West Piles Sanctions On Belarus After Plane Diversion
Belarusian strongman Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet on May 23 to intercept 
the Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania. 
When the plane was forced to land in Minsk, Belarus arrested dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapega on board. 
The EU responded quickly by blocking Belarusian airlines from flying to the bloc and stopped carriers from its 27 
nations from using Belarusian airspace. 
The bloc had already slapped sanctions last year on 88 individuals -- including Lukashenko and his son -- over a 
brutal crackdown on protests since the veteran leader claimed victory at elections in August deemed fraudulent by 
the West. 
The US imposed a slew of sanctions on Belarusian state-owned companies in May after authorities forced the 
Ryanair flight to land in Minsk by alleging a bomb threat. 
The Belarusian authorities detained thousands during the demonstrations sparked by last year's election and the 
EU says that some 500 political prisoners remain behind bars. 
"We are clearly showing that Stalinism and state terror no longer have a place in the 21st century," Luxembourg 
Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said. 
Lukashenko, ruler of Belarus since 1994, has so far shrugged off the pressure with backing from his key ally 
Russia. 
Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis complained that Belarus was hitting back by sending migrants, 
mostly Iraqis and Syrians, across its border. 
He warned the flow could increase after sanctions were approved and that Lithuania "might need help and 
assistance from other European countries".

 EU foreign ministers on Monday agreed to sanction key sectors of the Belarus economy as the bloc ratchets up 
pressure on President Alexander Lukashenko after the forced landing of an airliner. 
Ministers meeting in Luxembourg backed broad-ranging measures targeting major revenue sources for the 
Belarusian regime: potash fertiliser exports, the tobacco industry, petroleum and petrochemical products. 
Officials said the measures -- including a ban on sales of surveillance equipment to Belarus and tightening of an 
arms embargo -- should be formally adopted by the 27-nation bloc in the coming days. 
The ministers also officially signed off on adding 86 additional individuals and entities to an assets freeze and visa 
ban blacklist. 
Seven people -- including defence minister Viktor Khrenin and transport minister Alexei Avramenko -- were 
sanctioned for the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger jet last month. 
The remaining 71 individuals -- including Russian tycoon Mikhail Gutseriyev, Lukashenko's son Dmitry and 
daughter-in-law Liliya -- were targeted for ties to the Belarus government's sweeping crackdown on opposition or for 
supporting the regime.

 "We want the release of the political prisoners, an end to the violence against protesters and the opposition, and an

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said earlier that the economic sanctions should be wrapped up after a summit 
of the bloc's leaders in Brussels later this week. 
"We're going to hurt the economy of Belarus heavily." 
EU statistics show that trade with Belarus topped 10 billion euros in 2020. 
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who insists she rightfully won last year's poll, welcomed the 
inclusion of business tycoons and top officials on the blacklist.

"It's a rather strong sanction list," she told a press conference in Brussels. 
EU Targets Key Belarus Sectors After Plane Diversion
Belarusian strongman Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet on May 23 to intercept 
the Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania. 
When the plane was forced to land in Minsk, Belarus arrested dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapega on board. 
The EU responded quickly by blocking Belarusian airlines from flying to the bloc and stopped carriers from its 27 
nations from using Belarusian airspace. 
The bloc had already slapped sanctions last year on 88 individuals -- including Lukashenko and his son -- over a 
brutal crackdown on protests since the veteran leader claimed victory at elections in August deemed fraudulent by 
the West. 
The authorities detained thousands during the demonstrations and the EU says that some 500 political prisoners 
remain behind bars. 
"We are clearly showing that Stalinism and state terror no longer have a place in the 21st century," Luxembourg 
Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said. 
Lukashenko, ruler of Belarus since 1994, has so far shrugged off the pressure with backing from his key ally 
Russia. 
Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis complained that Belarus was hitting back by sending migrants, 
mostly Iraqis and Syrians, across its border. 
He warned the flow could increase after sanctions were approved and that Lithuania "might need help and 
assistance from other European countries".

       European stocks were seeing modest gains on Monday and yields held steady, as investors awaited a speech 
by ECB President Christine Lagarde before the European Parliament for directional cues.
 Analysts expect her to maintain the ECB's dovish stance, saying that it is too soon to consider tapering support.
 Elsewhere, St. Louis Federal Reserve President Jim Bullard offered a fresh dose of hawkishness, saying he sees 
an initial interest rate increase happening in 2022.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 edged up 0.3 percent to 453.21 after losing 1.6 percent on Friday. The German DAX, 
France's CAC 40 index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were up between 0.2 percent and half a percent.
 Banks fell broadly, with Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale losing about 1 percent on concerns that they could 
face challenges in their bond portfolios in a rising interest rate regime.
 Italian-American vehicle maker CNH Industrial rallied 2.1 percent after it agreed a deal to buy Raven Industries at 
an enterprise value of $2.1 billion.
 Vivendi shares rose half a percent in Paris. Hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman's Pershing Square Tontine 
Holdings Ltd. has agreed to acquire 10 percent of Universal Music Group from the French media conglomerate for 
about $4 billion, the companies said in a statement on Sunday.
 EssilorLuxottica SA shares were little changed. The ophthalmic company announced the renewal of its exclusive 
license agreement with American luxury lifestyle brand Tory Burch.
 British supermarket chain Morrisons Supermarkets jumped 32 percent following a takeover pursuit.
 The company confirmed an unsolicited highly conditional non-binding cash offer of 230 pence per share from 
Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Funds XI or CD&R.
 The Board, however, rejected the conditional proposal saying it significantly undervalues the firm. Tesco, 
Sainsbury and Ocado were up 2-5 percent.
 Travel-related stocks were moving lower as U.K. scientists warned of 'miserable winter' due to new respiratory 
viruses related to the Delta variant, which originated in India.
 Budget airline easyJet shed 0.6 percent, Ryanair edged down 0.2 percent and British Airways-owner IAG declined 
0.8 percent.
 In economic releases, British households' optimism about their finances over the next twelve months reached its 
highest level in five years in the second quarter, survey results from IHS Markit showed.
European Shares Rise Ahead Of Lagarde Speech
 The headline Scottish Widows household finance index, which measures households' overall perceptions of 
financial wellbeing, rose to 44.7 in the second quarter from 42.0 in the first quarter.
 The indicator signaled the weakest deterioration in U.K. household finances since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

       U.K. stocks rebounded a little on Monday after hitting a one-month low earlier in the session on worries that 
high inflation could force the Fed to tighten its monetary policy sooner than expected.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was up 13 points, or 0.2 percent, at 7,030, after having hit an intraday low of 6,948.63. 
The index lost 1.9 percent on Friday on concerns about an early increase in interest rates.

 The United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada announced[1] coordinated sanctions Monday on 
dozens of Belarusian individuals and entities in response to the government's forced diversion of a Ryanair flight[2] 
last month and ongoing crackdown against the country's pro-democracy movement. 
Why it matters: The West is ratcheting up its pressure campaign against Belarusian President Alexander 
Lukashenko, who — with the backing of Russia — has continued to cling to power 10 months after an election that 
international observers have condemned as fraudulent. Belarusian security services called in a fake bomb threat to 
force a Ryanair passenger flight traveling from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk. Once the flight landed, agents 
arrested 
Raman 
Pratasevich, 
a 
journalist 
and 
opposition 
leader, 
and 
Sofiya 
Sapega, 
another 
journalist.Lukashenko's regime has also carried out a brutal crackdown[3] against Belarusians protesting the rigged 
presidential elections in August 2020, detaining and torturing pro-democracy activists. What they're saying: "We are 
united in calling for the regime to end its repressive practices against its own people. We are disappointed the 
regime has opted to walk away from its human rights obligations, adherence to democratic principles, and 
engagement with the international community," the U.S., EU, U.K. and Canada said in a joint statement[4]. 
The big picture: The EU is also preparing a fourth round of economic sanctions that will target Belarus' banking, oil, 
tobacco and potash industries, according to the New York Times[5]. 
Go deeper: Russia blocks flights that avoid Belarusian airspace[6]

arlier this month, a British chief executive had an email run-in with one of his customers that left the woman 
gobsmacked. This man is not a famous grouch, like Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary, who once said the idea the 
customer was always right was "horseshit".
Nor does he make news like James Watt, co-founder of the craft beer group, BrewDog, who last week vowed to 
listen and learn after dozens of exstaff wrote an open letter claiming the company was rife with "toxic attitudes" and 
had a "rotten culture".
His name is James Price and he runs an outfit he founded called Everything Genetic, which is one of the Covid test 
providers the UK government lists for arriving travellers who need to prove they can safely leave quarantine.
The email dust-up began when a friend of mine who had flown into London from abroad wrote to ask him for a 
refund because the test results she had ordered from his firm had failed to turn up at the expected time.
Mr Price wrote back to say that as far as he could tell, his company had stuck to its advertised turnaround times and 
if he paid a refund there would be no test result. My friend, fearing this meant she would be trapped at home even 
longer, protested vigorously. She said she needed the result and a refund would encourage customer loyalty, to 
which Mr Price told her bluntly: "We'd rather have return customers that understand what they purchase."
Lists of top bosses are fine but what about the 50 worst?
He eventually relented when shown what one of his staff had told her about when her results would be ready. 
Conceding she had been given incorrect customer service information, he offered both the refund and her test 
results, but it was too late.
My friend, a former senior manager, said she found his attitude so belittling she would never use his firm again.
Mr Price told me later he was sorry for any poor service, including his responses to customer complaints, which 
would now be handled by others in the company.
But he came to mind last week when an annual list of "top CEOs" came out, this time from Glassdoor, the career 
site where employees can post anonymous reviews of their companies.
The list ranked bosses in the US, UK, Canada, France and Germany over the 12 troubled months up to May this 
year, using an internal rating system that measures the quality, quantity and consistency of reviews.
Among its more notable findings: Microsoft's Satya Nadella made it on to every country's list except France, which 
takes some doing, according to
Glassdoor.
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg failed to make it to the list of top 100 US chief executives for the first time since the 
rankings started in 2013, when he was rated number one, which is also quite a feat.
Other CEOs who made it on to three countries' lists were Salesforce's Marc Benioff; Morgan Stanley's James 
Gorman and Airbus' Guillaume Faury.
This is all interesting, as were the reasons employees gave for rating these bosses so highly. They didn't just 
provide decent pay, good benefits and career progression, many also got points for offering flexible or remote 
working.
This is all good to know. Yet the experience of my friend was a reminder that it might also be good to have a 
reliable list of the worst CEOs. Wouldn't that offer a more useful guide for potential employees, customers and 
investors, especially when it comes to smaller, less scrutinised companies? I know a few people have attempted 
such things over the years, but no one with the heft of Glassdoor. When I asked the site if it had ever considered 
such a list, a spokesman said it had not. "We prefer to look at best practice and those that are doing well."
He pointed out CEOs get a Glassdoor rating based on cumulative reviews - as opposed to one for the most recent 
year - and these can be instructive.
Ryanair's O'Leary scores just 43 per cent, well below the site's average CEO rating of 73 per cent. BrewDog's Watt 
comes in at just 52 per cent.
That is all very well, but if the site ever comes up with an annual ranking of the worst CEOs, I know I won't be the 
only one eager to read it.

Jun 21, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 EU steps up actions against Lukashenko regime with additional sanctions[1] 
Today (21 June), the EU announced a further 78 individuals and eight entities to be added to its Belarus sanction 
list. The measures were coordinated with Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Further economic 
sanctions are expected to be announced at this week's European Council of heads of government. 
The grounding of a Ryanair flight flying from Athens to Vilnius in Minsk resulting in the detention of journalist Roman 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega on 23 May has galvanized the EU's foreign affairs council into taking 
tougher measures against Belarus. The hijacking, which took place just before a special European Council resulted 
in a call for the additional measures. 
Foreign ministers also had the opportunity to meet the leader of Belarus's democratic opposition, Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya ahead of today's meeting over breakfast. Borrell said that ministers listened attentively to her 
assessment of the current situation and her call for the European Union to continue maintaining a determined 
position. Tskihanouskaya later went on to meet with the Commission Vice President for Values, Věra Jourov. 
 Today, Europe sent a joint &#38; powerful signal of support for Belarusians: we are not alone in our fight for

Borrell reiterated that the European Union remains ready to support a future democratic Belarus with a 
comprehensive plan of economic support of up to €3 billion for a democratic Belarus[4]. 
EU steps up actions against Lukashenko regime with additional sanctions
Asked about whether sanctions would push Lukashenko towards Putin, Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielieu 
Landsbergis said that Tsikhanouskay told ministers that we don't have to be naive about the measures pushing 
Lukashenko towards Putin, he is already bundled with Putin. 
Lukashenko has deliberately directed migrants towards Lithuania which has taken in around 500 asylum seekers in 
the last month. Lithuania more than any other EU country bordering Belarus has been targeted for its outspoken 
condemnation of the regime, it has also harboured many Belarusians fleeing for safety. Lukashenko said publicly 
that he would stop deterring migrants going to Lithuania, there is also some evidence that more flights into Belarus 
from Baghdad and Turkey are channelling migrants to the country. 
US, Canada, UK and EU 
The coordinated statement of the US, Canada, UK and the EU called for an adherence to democratic principles, 
and engagement with the international community, it stated: 'We are further united in our call for the Lukashenko 
regime to cooperate fully with international investigations into the events of 23 May; immediately release all political 
prisoners; implement all the recommendations of the independent expert mission under the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Moscow Mechanism; and, enter into a comprehensive and genuine 
political dialogue between the authorities and representatives of the democratic opposition and civil society, 
facilitated by the OSCE.'

Jun 21, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 The European Union is set to ban new loans to Belarus after reaching a deal on Friday for economic sanctions on 
Minsk as punishment for forcing down a flight to arrest a journalist, the Austrian foreign ministry and three diplomats 
said, write Francois Murphy Sabine Siebold and Robin Emmott. 
Broad economic sanctions would be the EU's strongest response yet to the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in May 
by Belarusian authorities to arrest an exiled dissident, a move the bloc's leaders have called state piracy. 
Restrictions on the Belarusian financial sector, if agreed by EU governments at a political level, will include: a ban 
on new loans, a ban on EU investors from trading securities or buying short-term bonds and a ban on EU banks 
from providing investment services. EU export credits will also end. 
Friday's agreement overcame objections from Austria, whose Raiffeisen Bank International (RBIV.VI)[1] is a big 
player in Belarus through its Priorbank subsidiary. 
EU leaders meet next Thursday for a scheduled summit. It was not yet clear if they will approve the deal agreed by 
expert officials. 
"With this agreement the EU is sending a clear and targeted signal against the Belarusian regime's unbearable acts 
of repression," the Austrian foreign ministry said in a statement. 
President Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has argued that the journalist pulled off the plane on May 
23, Roman Protasevich, had been plotting a rebellion, and he has accused the West of waging a hybrid war against 
him. 
EU reaches deal on Belarus economic sanctions, according to Austria , diplomats
The EU, NATO, Britain, Canada and the United States have expressed outrage that a flight between EU members 
Greece and Lithuania was pressed to land in Minsk and authorities then arrested the 26-year-old exiled dissident 
with his 23-year-old girlfriend. 
POTASH, TOBACCO, OIL 
EU experts tasked with drawing up sanctions agreed on a ban of exports from the bloc of any communications 
equipment that could be used for spying, and a tighter arms embargo to include hunting rifles. 
They also agreed restrictions on EU purchases from Belarus of tobacco products, as well as oil and oil-related 
products, and a ban on importing potash, a major Belarusian export. 
There will be exemptions in the financial sanctions for humanitarian purposes, while private savings of Belarusian 
citizens will not be affected, one of the diplomats said. 
Closely allied to Russia, which sees Belarus as a buffer country against NATO expansion, Lukashenko has been 
impervious to foreign pressure since disputed elections last August, which the opposition and the West say were 
rigged. Massive street protests have had little impact on his grip on power. 
The EU has already imposed three rounds of sanctions on individuals, including Lukashenko, since last year, 
freezing their assets in the EU and banning travel. On Monday, foreign ministers will approve another round, with 
78 people and eight entities to be blacklisted, diplomats said. 
EU governments now want to hit sectors that are central to the Belarus economy, to inflict real punishment on 
Lukashenko. 
Exports of potash - a potassium-rich salt used in fertilizer - are a major source of foreign currency for Belarus, and 
state firm Belaruskali says it produces 20% of the world's supply. 
The EU statistics agency said the bloc imported 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) worth of chemicals including potash 
from Belarus last year, as well as more than 1 billion euros worth of crude oil and related products such as fuel and 
lubricants. 
Germany has said sanctions should continue until Belarus holds free elections and releases political prisoners.

 The EU, US, Britain and Canada ratcheted up pressure on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko Monday 
by imposing coordinated sanctions after the forced landing of a Ryanair airliner. 
 'We are united in our deep concern regarding the Lukashenko regime's continuing attacks on human rights, 
fundamental freedoms, and international law,' they said in a joint statement.  
 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the measures 'demonstrated the steadfast transatlantic commitment to 
supporting the Belarusian people's democratic aspirations'. 
 The EU and the US both targeted dozens of individuals and entities over a brutal crackdown on opposition since 
Lukashenko claimed victory in elections last August deemed fraudulent by the West.  
 The 27-nation bloc and London added seven officials — including the defence and transport ministers of Belarus 
— to their sanctions blacklists for the grounding of the Ryanair jet. 
 EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg also backed broad-ranging sanctions targeting major revenue 
sources for the Belarusian regime: potash fertiliser exports, the tobacco industry, petroleum and petrochemical 
products. 
 EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that the wider economic sanctions should be formally adopted soon. 
 'Today we have confirmed and decided that sectoral sanctions will be taken against Belarus, which will have a 
severe impact on the Belarusian economy,' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said ahead of the meeting.  
 'We want the release of the political prisoners, an end to the violence against protesters and the opposition, and an 
inclusive dialogue that will lead to free and fair elections.' 
 Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who insists she rightfully won last year's poll, welcomed the 
EU's inclusion of business tycoons and top officials on the blacklist. 
 'It's a rather strong sanctionlist,' she told a press conference in Brussels. 
- 'Stalinism' - 
Belarusian strongman Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet on May 23 to intercept 
the Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania. 
West piles sanctions on Belarus after plane diversion
 When the plane was forced to land in Minsk, Belarus arrested dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapega on board. 
 The EU responded quickly by blocking Belarusian airlines from flying to the bloc and stopped carriers from its 27 
nations from using Belarusian airspace. 
 The bloc had already slapped sanctions last year on 88 individuals — including Lukashenko and his son — over a 
brutal crackdown on protests since the veteran leader claimed victory at elections in August deemed fraudulent by 
the West. 
 The US imposed a slew of sanctions on Belarusian state-owned companies in May after authorities forced the 
Ryanair flight to land in Minsk by alleging a bomb threat. 
 The Belarusian authorities detained thousands during the demonstrations sparked by last year's election and the 
EU says that some 500 political prisoners remain behind bars. 
 'We are clearly showing that Stalinism and state terror no longer have a place in the 21st century,' Luxembourg 
Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said. 
 Lukashenko, ruler of Belarus since 1994, has so far shrugged off the pressure with backing from his key ally 
Russia. 
 Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis complained that Belarus was hitting back by sending migrants, 
mostly Iraqis and Syrians, across its border. 
 He warned the flow could increase after sanctions were approved and that Lithuania 'might need help and 
assistance from other European countries'.

 The European Union is expected to impose further economic penalties on Belarus as a result of the forced 
diversion and landing of a Ryanair (RYA.L) flight in May, which resulted in the detention of an opposition journalist, 
Reuters reported Monday.
Speaking ahead of a foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Monday 
said the bloc will approve a package of new sanctions, with travel bans and asset freezes on 86 Belarusian 
individuals, such as the country's transport, defense and traffic air officials, as well as companies. 
A provisional agreement was reached on Friday to also apply economic sanctions on the country's financial, oil, 
tobacco and potash sectors, the report said.

 EU foreign ministers on Monday agreed sanctions on key sectors of the Belarus economy as the bloc ratchets up 
pressure on President Alexander Lukashenko after the forced landing of an airliner, diplomats said. 
 Ministers meeting in Luxembourg backed broad-ranging measures targeting major revenue sources for the 
Belarusian regime: potash fertiliser exports, the tobacco industry, petroleum and petrochemical products, and the 
financial sector, diplomats told AFP. 
 Officials said the measures — including a ban on sales of surveillance equipment to Belarus and tightening of an 
arms embargo — should be formally adopted by the 27-nation bloc in the coming days. 
 Ministers also formally signed off on placing 86 additional individuals and entities in Belarus on an assets freeze 
and visa ban blacklist, with the names to be publishedin the EU's official journal later in the day. 
 Seven of the individuals being sanctioned are linked directly to the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger jet last 
month and the rest are targeted over the government's sweeping crackdown on opposition, diplomats said. 
 'We will consistently continue on the path of sanctioning Lukashenko and his regime. We will no longer only 
sanction individuals but we will now also impose sectoral sanctions,' German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said 
ahead of the meeting.  
 'We want to contribute in this way to the financial drying up of this regime.' 
 EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell had earlier said the sanctions should be wrapped up after a summit of the 
bloc's leaders in Brussels later this week. 
 'Sanctions are a way of putting pressure on the government of Belarus,' Borrell told journalists. 
 'We're going to hurt the economy of Belarus heavily.'

Twitter. 
 Lithuania's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said he would also raise with EU counterparts the issue of a 
sudden spike in migrants, mostly Iraqis and Syrians, crossing over into the country from Belarus. 
 Landsbergis accused the Belarusian authorities of funnelling the migrants through to hit back at its neighbour for 
leading the push to punish Minsk. 
 He warned the flow could increase after sanctions were approved and that Lithuania 'might need help and

 Germany is keen to broaden the economic sanctions placed on Minsk as EU foreign ministers gather in 
Luxembourg. Heiko Maas has also called for renewed efforts over the Turkey refugee deal.EU foreign ministers 
meeting in Luxembourg on Monday are set to increase the pressure on Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko 
by blacklisting dozens more supporters of his regime. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has called for broad economic sanctions against Minsk in light of the forced 
landing of a Ryanair flight in order to detain a dissident journalist. 
"I think additional sanctions against Belarus are unavoidable," Maas told German newspaper Die Welt. 
"We should extend the sanctions to parts of the Belarusian economy, such as the potash industry or the energy 
sector. And we should deprive the government in Minsk of the possibility to raise funds within the EU by issuing 
government bonds," he said. 
Forced landing causes widespread turbulence 
Belarusian strongman Lukashenko sparked widespread outrage by dispatching a fighter jet on May 23 to intercept a 
flight from Greece to Lithuania, eventually forcing the plane to land in Minsk, before arresting dissident journalist 
Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
The European Union subsequently blocked Belarusian airlines from flying to the bloc, while it has also stopped 
carriers from its 27 nations from using Belarus' air space. 
According to EU diplomats, speaking to various news agencies, the foreign ministers convening in Luxembourg are 
likely to formally agree to placing more than 80 additional individuals and entities on an assets freeze, as well as 
imposing a visa ban upon them. 
Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994. He has so far managed to shrug off the pressure from the West, while 
retaining the support of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who insists she won last year's national election, will talk with 
the ministers in Brussels ahead of their summit on Monday. 
Refugee arrangement with Turkey under the microscope 
Meanwhile, Germany's Foreign Ministry is calling for a renewed focus on the EU's refugee deal with Turkey. 
"We need an update to our migration cooperation with Turkey," Heiko Maas told Die Welt. 
"In all the difficulties we have with the Turkish government, we must acknowledge that the country has taken on a 
not inconsiderable migration burden for us," Maas said. 
A new accord would likely mean additional funding for Turkey, he said. 
EU foreign ministers mull increased sanctions against Belarus
"I don't want to put any numbers out into the world, but it is completely clear that it won't work without money," Maas 
said. 
The refugee deal between the EU and Turkey includes provisions for Ankara to crack down on unauthorized 
migration to the bloc and for Greece to send migrants who have reached the Aegean islands illegally back to 
Turkey. 
In return, the EU takes one recognized Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian sent back. Brussels also 
provides financial support to the homeland of the refugees in order to take care of them.

 It's not clear what drove Belarusian strongman Aleksandr Lukashenko to force down a Ryanair passenger jet 
transiting through his national airspace last month and to kidnap dissident journalist Roman Protasevich from it. But 
it's clear who's on his side in the resultant outcry: his ambivalent patron Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even as 
Europe has suspended flights to Belarus, Putin has kept airspace open on the eastern side of the border and 
threatened retaliatory action against the European Union. The codependent, if unequal, relationship between Minsk 
and Moscow is now set to deepen, especially after theEuropean Union[1]andUnited States[2]introduced sweeping 
new sanctions today. 
 It first became apparent to me Lukashenko would do anything to retain power when he flew over a crowd I was 
standing with in a helicopter in August 2020 in Minsk. He was peering out of the doorway with rifle in hand. 
Lukashenko may have assumed the European Union was simply feckless and would do nothing or he may no 
longer have cared about the national airline, the Belarusian economy, or any outside relations bar his situational 
allies in Moscow. Belavia, the Belarusian national flag carrier, has now been banned from most of its neighbors' 
airspace and can no longer fly into the EU. It is, in effect, a useless asset.

threatened retaliatory action against the European Union. The codependent, if unequal, relationship between Minsk 
and Moscow is now set to deepen, especially after theEuropean Union[3]andUnited States[4]introduced sweeping 
new sanctions today. 
 It first became apparent to me Lukashenko would do anything to retain power when he flew over a crowd I was 
standing with in a helicopter in August 2020 in Minsk. He was peering out of the doorway with rifle in hand. 
Lukashenko may have assumed the European Union was simply feckless and would do nothing or he may no 
longer have cared about the national airline, the Belarusian economy, or any outside relations bar his situational 
allies in Moscow. Belavia, the Belarusian national flag carrier, has now been banned from most of its neighbors' 
airspace and can no longer fly into the EU. It is, in effect, a useless asset. 
Putin and Lukashenko Are Reluctant Authoritarian Bros
 But renewed isolation is further binding the Lukashenko regime to Russia, which would like nothing more than to 
tamp down protests and further assimilate the nation while stripping its assets—such as Belaruskali, a potash 
fertilizer company, or Minsk Tractor Works—at minimum political and economic cost. Two weeks ago, Putin and 
Lukashenko met for a visibly awkward weekend of socializing aboard a Russian yacht on the Black Sea. The 
comradely fraternization seemed to have been woodenly feigned on both sides, but the spectacle made the mutual 
understanding they will sink or swim together obvious. 
 It was an expensive weekend out on the boat. Every visit Lukashenko pays Moscow or Sochi for the latest tte--tte 
with Putin seems to wind up costing the Russian tax payer a half billion dollars in credits and subsidies. Supporting 
Lukashenko has also incurred social and diplomatic costs, which have exacerbated tensions with the West. The 
Kremlin has been willing to countenance—up to a point. 
 At this point, a certain cavalier disregard seems to have crept in. In less diplomatically heated times, the Kremlin 
would not have allowed such divisive events to take place immediately before the annual St. Petersburg 
International Economic Forum, where Putin was asked directly about Belarus and responded coolly by 
acknowledging Belarus had many internal issues and 'we are trying to take a neutral position on Belarus.' In 
response to the question of the jailed journalist, he snapped: 'You're asking political questions at an economic 
forum. I don't know Roman Protasevich and don't want to know him.' 
 Annoyance and negative publicity of such public confrontations aside, Moscow continues to see no good 
alternative to Lukashenko. The example of a popular democratic revolution led by civil society ousting the 
government—of the sort that has led Russia to likely permanently lose Kyiv—remains the Kremlin's greatest fear. 
No amount of neutrality declarations from the Belarus democratic opposition movement has been enough to sway 
such fears. Likewise, Lukashenko knows full well he cannot fully surrender his autonomy to Putin and still remain an 
independent actor. The fate of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Rostov-on-Don, Russia 
and will most likely spend the rest of his life as a privileged prisoner in a villa under Russian Federal Security 
Service guard, was as much a lesson for Lukashenko as it was for Putin. 
 But Putin doesn't actually want to be stuck with the aged, incompetent, brutal, and increasingly erratic Lukashenko. 
Every new instance of brutal escalation by his security services further increases Lukashenko's dependence on the 
Kremlin, which continues to discreetly search for ways to transition away from him on its own terms. Lukashenko's 
effective deterring of any kind of civil society structures also prevented the foundation and growth of pro-Russian 
'Russian world' groups Moscow typically uses to leverage its power in post-Soviet societies. The lack of any such 
useful organizations, associations, or actors on its soil left purposefully barren is the reason for the Kremlin's 
reluctant backing of Lukashenko—and an underemphasized motivation in his refusal to allow any kind of civil 
society to take root. 
 Lukashenko's tight control of the economy is also, in part, aimed at staving off Russian efforts. Belarus's Soviet-
style economy, where Minsk continues to control around three quarters of the economy, remains unchanged since 
Soviet times. Decommunization and privatization never took place in Belarus, and so even as Lukashenko 
continues to resist the furthering of integration with Russia, he oversees a territory full of assets many in Moscow 
would like to usurp and redistribute. But he now seems to have overplayed his hand. Increased sectoral sanctions 
will likely have the effect of having European businesses pivot away from its crucial potash fertilizer production and 
will further put pressure on the Belarusian industry. 
 When I interviewed Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya in Vilnius, Lithuania, the day before the 
plane incident took place, I asked her if she was concerned with Russian capital taking over large parts of Belarus's 
economy as a part of Lukashenko's payment to Russia for assistance in quelling the revolution. 'For 26 years, the 
closest relationship that Belarus has forged has been with the Russian Federation,' she said. 'There is nothing bad 
about the fact that half our trade is with Russia. It is, of course, sad that the Kremlin has supported Lukashenko. He 
needs this diplomatic support, and he needs to buy it in some fashion as there can be no talk of any actually friendly 
relations. And what he is selling now in order to keep that support is a huge question to which the people of Belarus 
have no answer.'

Tsikhanouskaya during a European Foreign Affairs Ministers meeting at the European Council building in 
Luxembourg, Monday, June 21, 2021. EU foreign ministers were set to approve Monday a new set of sanctions 
against scores of officials in Belarus and prepare a series of measures aimed at the country's economy. (Johanna

BRUSSELS (AP) — The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada joined forces Monday to impose 
sanctions on several senior officials in Belarus over the forced diversion to Minsk of a passenger plane travelling 
between two EU countries last month. 
 Asset freezes and travel bans were also imposed on a number of officials linked to the security crackdown that 
continues to rock the country some 10 months after President Alexander Lukashenko was returned to power in 
elections branded by the EU and others as 'fraudulent.' 
 'We are united in our deep concern regarding the Lukashenko regime's continuing attacks on human rights, 
fundamental freedoms, and international law,' the four said in a joint statement. 
 'We are committed to support the long-suppressed democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus and we stand 
together to impose costs on the regime for its blatant disregard of international commitments,' they said. 
 The EU hit seven people and one entity over the 'forced and unlawful' landing of the Ryanair plane, which was 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania when it was ordered to stop in Minsk, where authorities arrested Raman 
Pratasevich, a dissident journalist who was one of the passengers.  
 The four called on Minsk to cooperate with an international probe into the incident, immediately release all political 
prisoners, and 'enter into a comprehensive and genuine political dialogue' with the democratic opposition and civil 
society. 
 At a meeting in Luxembourg, EU foreign ministers also prepared a series of economic measures that are aimed at 
hitting Lukashenko and his allies. EU leaders are expected to endorse them at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. 
 The EU has gradually ratcheted up sanctions since Lukashenko - dubbed the last dictator in Europe - won a sixth 
term last August in elections it says were fraudulent. The measures have targeted people accused of electoral 
misconduct and responsibility for the police crackdown that followed. (Ad) With Democrats now controlling both

away. This could result in established Washington State weed companies being able to market across state lines -- 
setting off a bidding war for quality stocks at reasonable prices. 
 But the 27-nation bloc has taken a harder approach since the Ryanair incident, and over the country's alleged use 
of migrants to pressure neighboring Lithuania, which has provided a safe-haven to Belarusian opposition figures 
and is one of Lukashenko's most vocal critics. 
 Among their actions Monday, the ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 78 Belarus officials and froze 
the assets of 8 'entities,' which are usually companies, banks, or associations. It means that a total of 166 people 
and 15 entities are now under EU restrictive measures. 
 'This decision was made in view of the escalation of serious human rights violations in Belarus and the violent 
repression of civil society, democratic opposition and journalists,' a statement said. 
 EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who chaired the meeting, said the economic sanctions 'are going to hurt ... 
the economy of Belarus heavily.' 
 The measures are likely to include action against the export of potash - a common fertilizer ingredient - tobacco 
industry exports and petroleum products, among others. 
 'We will no longer just sanction individuals. We will now also impose sectoral sanctions -- meaning that we will now 
get to work on the economic areas that are of particular significance for Belarus and for the regime's income,' 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. 
 'We want to make very, very clear to Lukashenko that there is no going back," Maas said. 
 Maas said the 27 EU countries stand united on sanctions 'We are really very, very determined not to budge, not 
just today -- nothing about this will change in the coming weeks and months,' he said. 
 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said EU countries had thought only a month ago that it still 
might be possible to reason with Lukashenko but that "the mood is different now.' 
 Landsbergis accused Minsk of 'weaponizing' migration flows. He said around 500 people are sheltering in 
Lithuania, most from Iraq, and that Belarus border guards brought 30 refugees to the border in recent days. He said 
Lithuania has limited capacity for them and is building a tent camp. 
 To kick off Monday's meeting, the ministers held a working breakfast with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main 
opposition candidate to challenge Lukashenko in last year's election.

7 Stocks to Support Your New Year's Resolutions[2] After a year like 2020, many Americans figure that just getting 
to 2021 was enough. But for many people, the start of a new year still means making resolutions. And while many 
Americans are still waking up to Groundhog's Day, there is hope that things will look dramatically different in 
September than they do right now. 
 Some of the most popular resolutions include losing weight, exercising more, or taking steps to get our life and/or 
business more organized. And many pure-play companies lean into these trends and are doing well. 
 As an alternative to this, you can also invest in companies that are not pure plays but can still benefit from 
consumers looking to start fresh. Owning these stocks helps you manage your risk. If the trend holds, you can ride 
the wave. On the other hand, if the wave turns into a ripple, the stocks have other catalysts to get them through. 
 In this special presentation, we'll take a look at both of these categories. We've got several pure-play companies 
that let investors buy stocks in companies benefiting from these trends. We'll also give you a few stocks that fall in 
the latter category. 
 These are stocks that you might buy at any time and for many reasons. However, they present excellent buys as 
the new year begins.

 [Sava Jankovic, MA (University of Warsaw), MSc (Warsaw University of Technology), PhD (University of Dundee) 
is Researcher at the Institute of Legal Studies of the Polish Academy of Sciences. His interests include the law of 
statehood, international responsibility, human rights law and peaceful resolution of conflicts.] 
Basic facts 
The Ryanair plane flying from Athens to Vilnius on 23 of May was forced to land in Minsk by the Belorussian MIG-
29 fighter under the guise of a terrorist attack. The Belorussian regime claimed there was a bomb on board the 
plane, while in reality none was found. On the other hand, a Byelorussian oppositionist and his girlfriend, who were 
among the passengers, got detained during the 'security operation'. The whole affair turned into a diplomatic 
scandal, accusations of Belarus breaching international air laws, the suspension of flights through the Belarusian 
airspace linked with the suspension of operating permits for Belorussian national carrier Belavia as well as 
economic and person-targeted sanctions. 
Was the diversion of the Ryanair plane by the Belarusian army in accordance with international law? 
The paramount question surrounding the incident is whether the Belarusian state had a right to divert the passenger 
plane and command its landing in Minsk. 
In legal terms, every state exercises sovereignty over its airspace, thus a civil plane using its airspace falls within its 
jurisdiction. According to Article 1 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention[1]), a 
state has 'complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory'. Pursuant to Article 3 bis (b), a 
state is entitled to require landing at a designated airport of a civil aircraft flying above its territory only when the 
latter is flying 'without authority'(which was not the case with the Ryanair flight), or 'if there are reasonable grounds 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius: 
Part I
to conclude that it is being used for any purpose inconsistent with the aims of this Convention'. In addition, under 
Article 5 of the Convention, contracting states agree that all aircraft not engaged in scheduled international air 
services are entitled to non-stop flights across their territory. However, Article 5 contains a reservation providing that 
any participating state reserves the right to require landing. In that regard, the action of redirecting a plane and 
indicating the airport for landing by the Belarussian authorities has strong legal underpinnings. 
Nevertheless, operations of this calibre cannot be carried out without a compelling reason, as they would endanger 
the safety of civil aviation, alongside the comfort and trust of the passengers. AsJackson and 
Tzanakopoulos[2]rightly point out, stopping a vehicle on land is a different and customary situation, while breaking 
the flow of an aircraft demands a solid reason. The Belarussian side argued that there was a bomb on board the 
plane, which was sufficient ground for taking the measure. Hence, the Belarusian action complied with international 
law norms,ergoArticle 3 bis (b) of the Chicago Convention. The Belorussian side clarified that it possessed the 
information about the danger and forwarded it to the Ryanair crew. Aksamentov, director of the Institute of Air and 
Space Law AEROHELP,stated[3]that the emergency landing occurred according to the rules, 'even if the 
information about the mining of the plane did not come from the crew, but from some third party, including an 
anonymous one'. 
On the other hand, there are indications that cast doubts on the official version provided by Belarus. First, why did 
they decide to divert the plane, which almost reached its destination in Vilnius to a further airport in Minsk? Second, 
had the operation be undertaken with the use of a military fighter or could it be simply carried out on land, upon 
reaching the final destination shortly? In that case, one may wonder if the operation was conducted with the 
principle of necessity and proportionality demanded by Appendix 2 of the Chicago Convention, stating that 
interception should be undertaken only as a last resort, but the Belarusian military jet took off immediately. This 
might have triggered fear in passengers, make the pilot nervous and put the whole plane at hazard. Thirdly, there 
arereports[4]that Belorrusian KGB agents were on board, who followed the Belarusian oppositionist, asserted an 
emergency landing and disembarked in Minsk. In consequence, no explosives were found, but the opposition 
journalist and his girlfriend were captured. This may reveal a real motive for the instructed landing. 
The incident should inevitably be investigated correctly, but if the presumptions of an orchestrated landing will 
confirm, Belarus may indeed be accused of breaching the respective provisions of the Chicago Convention, and, in 
fact, misusing it, which is proscribed by Article 4. If it turns out that Belarus had contracted agents who provided 
false information about the bomb as well as cooperated with the Belorussian KGB agents, it will be considered as 
an accomplice in the event and bear responsibility pursuant to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. Belarus 
might also be accused of contravening the provisions of the 1970 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful 
Seizure of Aircraft (theHague Convention 1970[5]), which it joined in 1971, by virtue of not apprehending and 
punishing passengers (agents) who allegedly insisted on landing, and thus were considered as those attempting to 
take control over the flight in light of Article 1 (a) of the treaty. Furthermore, Belarus might be accused of violating 
Article 10 of the 1971 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation (the 
Montreal Convention[6]) because it did not take'all practicable measures'to prevent the commission of an offence 
outlined in Article 1(1)(e) of the Convention, that is, unlawful and intentional communication of false information (to 
the pilot by the Air Traffic Control), thereby'endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight'. Yet, in both cases, the 
Belarussian state would be behind and thus the question of immunityratione materiaemay arise. 
International organizations and states voiced their concerns about the potential violation of international law by 
Belarus. The ICAOclaimed[7]that the forced landing'could be in breach of the Chicago Convention on International 
Civil Aviation', while the NATO Secretary-Generalstated[8]that grounding of theflight constitutes a 'serious and 
dangerous incident which requires international investigation'. The majority of the Western politicians were more 
concrete about the breach and the ensuing sanctions. The EU Commission PresidentUrsula von der 
Leyendescribed[9]the incident as 'utterly unacceptable', stating that 'any violation of international air transport rules 
must bear consequences'.Latvian Foreign Minister, Edgars Rinkēvičs,referred[10]to the incident as 'contrary to 
international law' and said that the reaction should be 'strong and effective'. The tendency of the Western states 
Forced landing of a passenger plane: Law and politics behind the Ryanair 4978 flight from Athens to Vilnius: 
Part I
towards a harsher language was repeated at the UN Security Council closed-door meeting on Belarus called for 26 
May. In aletter[11], six members (Estonia, France, Ireland, Norway, Great Britain and the United States) underlined 
that the interception of the Ryanair flight was 'a blatant attack on international civilian aviation safety and European 
security.' The fact, that the remaining members of the Security Council (India, Russia, China, Kenya, Mexico, Niger, 
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Viet Nam) did not sign reflects the political colour of the incident, 
described in the second part of this post. 
The card Belarus did not want to play 
Belarusian official stance is that it acted in accordance with international air law while performing its action of 
grounding the passenger plane. President Lukashenko whilespeaking[12]to the parliament on 26 of May revealed 
that the message about the bomb was communicated by the Belarus Air Traffic Control originated in Switzerland 
and that the military jet did not in any way force the Ryanair plane, and it was sent for security reasons only, so that 
the potential explosion does not affect people on the ground and premises (since, as he claimed, they could not do 
much about the onboard passengers). In a nutshell, the possibility of a purported terrorist attack justified the 
operation. 
Assuming that it is just a cover for Belorus's genuine intentions - arresting the opposition figure - as voiced by the 
Western world, it would be interesting to ponder over another possibility for justifying the action, which Belarus did 
not want to initiate, namely the conservative perception of sovereignty. This might have triggered a lesser backlash 
by the Western leaders, who had felt additionally irritated by the attempted deception manoeuvre regarding the 
bomb on board. 
Belarus is known for its rather Hegelian approach to sovereignty, in which a state has considerable control of its 
citizens and territory and where people enjoy fewer freedoms or pardons. There is no need to mention that Belarus 
is the only European state that is not a member of the Council of Europe and thus a non-party to the European 
Convention on Human Rights for the main reason that it still allows capital punishment. In states like Belarus, 
plotting or treachery against the government is considered an unfriendly act engendering the most severe 
consequences. Mr Protasevich since November 2020figures[13]on the government's list alongside 700 people as 
an'individual involved in terrorist activities'and faces charges on at least three criminal courts. If convicted of 
terrorism, he could face the death penalty. But if one looks a few decades behind, the same will recall how strictly 
espionage was treated in the whole of Europe and how draconian punishments could be expected for it. As a 
matter of fact, many Western states still have constitutionally envisaged high penalties for espionage or serious 
deeds against the interest of a state, which include the attempt at overthrowing the government. Yet, they don't 
observe them in a literal way and draw a considerable distinction between peaceful protests and attempts at 
overthrowing the government, in stark contrast to Belarus. With that in mind, the arrest of an'enemy of the 
state'could have been an expected act in Belarus, even if that involved a forceful landing of a passenger plane. 
One could easily imagine a comparable action of the US forces in case a wanted person would found himself within 
the US jurisdiction. Several'questionable'examples involving the display of sovereign powers could be furnished to 
this end. First, the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, deputy board chair at Huawei, in 2018 at the Vancouver International 
Airport, which, according to her, was a plotted action of the US and Canadian agencies. Second, in 2013, a Bolivian 
president's plane was grounded in Vienna under the suspicion that Edward Snowden, sought by the US for 
revealing a number of secret documents from the US National Security Agency, was among the passengers. 
Besides, there is a plethora of incidents related to states' non-consensual operations in other states' territories 
under the pretext of protecting vital national interests linked to the arrest or killing of wanted people, which is a 
much greater breach of international law. This was the case of a) the arrest of Adolf Eichmann by the Mossad in 
Argentina in 1960, which ended in a UN Security Council resolution138[14]condemning Israeli action; b) the 
interception of the EgyptAir aeroplane by the US Grumman F-14 Tomcat fighters in 1985 in order to arrest terrorists

 Germany is keen to broaden the economic sanctions placed on Minsk as EU foreign ministers gather in 
Luxembourg. Heiko Maas has also called for renewed efforts over the Turkey refugee deal.EU foreign ministers 
meeting in Luxembourg on Monday are set to increase the pressure on Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko 
by blacklisting dozens more supporters of his regime. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has called for broad economic sanctions against Minsk in light of the forced 
landing of a Ryanair flight in order to detain a dissident journalist. 
"I think additional sanctions against Belarus are unavoidable," Maas told German newspaper Die Welt. 
"We should extend the sanctions to parts of the Belarusian economy, such as the potash industry or the energy 
sector. And we should deprive the government in Minsk of the possibility to raise funds within the EU by issuing 
government bonds," he said. 
Forced landing causes widespread turbulence 
Belarusian strongman Lukashenko sparked widespread outrage by dispatching a fighter jet on May 23 to intercept a 
flight from Greece to Lithuania, eventually forcing the plane to land in Minsk, before arresting dissident journalist 
Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
The European Union subsequently blocked Belarusian airlines from flying to the bloc, while it has also stopped 
carriers from its 27 nations from using Belarus' air space. 
According to EU diplomats, speaking to various news agencies, the foreign ministers convening in Luxembourg are 
likely to formally agree to placing more than 80 additional individuals and entities on an assets freeze, as well as 
imposing a visa ban upon them. 
Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994. He has so far managed to shrug off the pressure from the West, while 
retaining the support of Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who insists she won last year's national election, will talk with 
the ministers in Brussels ahead of their summit on Monday. 
Refugee arrangement with Turkey under the microscope 
Meanwhile, Germany's Foreign Ministry is calling for a renewed focus on the EU's refugee deal with Turkey. 
"We need an update to our migration cooperation with Turkey," Heiko Maas told Die Welt. 
"In all the difficulties we have with the Turkish government, we must acknowledge that the country has taken on a 
not inconsiderable migration burden for us," Maas said. 
A new accord would likely mean additional funding for Turkey, he said. 
EU foreign ministers mull increased sanctions against Belarus
"I don't want to put any numbers out into the world, but it is completely clear that it won't work without money," Maas 
said. 
The refugee deal between the EU and Turkey includes provisions for Ankara to crack down on unauthorized 
migration to the bloc and for Greece to send migrants who have reached the Aegean islands illegally back to 
Turkey. 
In return, the EU takes one recognized Syrian refugee from Turkey for every Syrian sent back. Brussels also 
provides financial support to the homeland of the refugees in order to take care of them.

BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union foreign ministers agreed Monday to impose sanctions on scores of officials 
and several organizations in Belarus, and prepared a series of economic measures aimed at hitting President 
Alexander Lukashenko and his allies. 
 The EU has gradually ratcheted up sanctions since Lukashenko - dubbed the last dictator in Europe - won a sixth 
term last August in elections it says were fraudulent. The measures have targeted people accused of electoral 
misconduct and responsibility for the police crackdown that followed. 
 But the EU has taken a harder approach since Belarus' authorities forced a Ryanair plane to land in Minsk last 
month, and over the country's alleged use of migrants to pressure neighboring Lithuania, which has provided a 
safe-haven to Belarusian opposition figures and is one of Lukashenko's most vocal critics. 
 The ministers imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 78 Belarus officials and froze the assets of 8 'entities,' 
which are usually companies, banks, or associations. It means that a total of 166 people and 15 entities are now 
under EU restrictive measures. 
 'This decision was made in view of the escalation of serious human rights violations in Belarus and the violent 
repression of civil society, democratic opposition and journalists,' a statement said. 
 Seven people and one entity were hit over the 'forced and unlawful' landing of the Ryanair plane, which was 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania when it was ordered to stop in Minsk, where authorities arrested Raman 
Pratasevich, a dissident journalist who was one of the passengers.  
 The EU had already banned Belarus airline companies from flying over the bloc's territory or using its airports. 
 Borrell said the ministers will also prepare a raft of economic sanctions for EU leaders to endorse at a summit on 
Thursday. 'These are going to hurt, going to hurt the economy of Belarus heavily,' he said. (Ad) Nobody ever thinks

 The measures are likely to include action against the export of potash - a common fertilizer ingredient - tobacco 
industry exports and petroleum products, among others. 
 'We will no longer just sanction individuals. We will now also impose sectoral sanctions -- meaning that we will now 
get to work on the economic areas that are of particular significance for Belarus and for the regime's income,' 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. 
 'We want to make very, very clear to Lukashenko that there is no going back," Maas said. 
 Maas said the 27 EU countries stand united on sanctions 'We are really very, very determined not to budge, not 
just today -- nothing about this will change in the coming weeks and months,' he said. 
 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said EU countries had thought only a month ago that it still 
might be possible to reason with Lukashenko but that "the mood is different now.' 
 Landsbergis accused Minsk of 'weaponizing' migration flows. He said around 500 people are sheltering in 
Lithuania, most from Iraq, and that Belarus border guards brought 30 refugees to the border in recent days. He said 
Lithuania has limited capacity for them and is building a tent camp. 
 To kick off Monday's meeting, the ministers held a working breakfast with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the main 
opposition candidate to challenge Lukashenko in last year's election.

BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union foreign ministers will approve Monday a fresh set of sanctions against scores 
of officials in Belarus and prepare a series of measures aimed at hurting the country's economy, EU foreign policy 
chief Josep Borrell said. 
 The EU has ratcheted up sanctions since President Alexander Lukashenko won a sixth term last August in 
elections slammed as fraudulent by the 27-nation bloc. The measures have targeted people accused of electoral 
misconduct and responsibility for the police crackdown that followed. 
 'We will approve the package of new sanctions, which is a wider package,' Borrell told reporters as he arrived in 
Luxembourg to chair the ministerial meeting. He said asset freezes and travel bans will be slapped on a total of 
around 86 people and organizations. 
 Diplomats have said that a number of those targeted are linked to an incident last month in which a Ryanair flight 
traveling from Greece to Lithuania was diverted to Minsk, where authorities arrested Raman Pratasevich, a 
dissident journalist who was on board the airliner.  
 The EU has already banned Belarus airline companies from flying over the bloc's territory or using its airports.

7 Hotel Stocks Just Waiting For the Vaccine[2] Like any group of stocks related to travel and tourism, hotel stocks 
saw a steep drop in share prices in 2020. The leisure and hospitality sector that once had 15 million employees has 
lost 4 million jobs since February. 
 Many major cities will be feeling the ripple effects of the Covid-19 pandemic for years. However, there is ample 
evidence that shows the pandemic may be coming to an end. The number of new cases is dropping. The number of 
those getting vaccinated is rising. And even in the cities with the most restrictive mitigation measures, the slow 
process of reopening is beginning. 
 All of this can't come fast enough for individuals who rely on the travel and tourism industry for their livelihood. 
Hotel chains had at least some revenue coming in the door. And when earnings season concludes, the more 
budget-friendly hotel chains may realize revenue that is 75% of its 2019 numbers. But that is not enough to bring 
the hotels to anywhere near full employment. Particularly with hotels that have bars and restaurants that have 
remained closed or open at limited capacity. 
 Many economists are optimistic that travel may begin to look more normal by the summer of this year. And the 
global economy may deliver 6.4% GDP growth this year. With that in mind, the hotel chains with the best 
fundamentals and the broadest footprint will be in the best position as the economy reopens.

Monday after a compromise to end Austria's opposition to some proposed curbs on bank transactions, diplomats 
said.
It marks a significant escalation in the EU's pressure on Lukashenko's authoritarian government, reflecting outrage 
over the forced landing and detention of Roman Protasevich and his partner, Sofia Sapega, last month. The 
sanctions will test both the durability of Lukashenko's 27-year rule and the EU's ability to push for political change 
while minimising harm to Belarusians.
The package still needs to be legally finalised and details of precise measures remain confidential until publication. 
Its aim, diplomats said, is to target state companies and other big sources of revenue for the regime.
Belarus is one of the world's biggest exporters of potash, a crucial ingredient in fertilisers, and generates significant 
revenues from refining oil. Belaruskali, the state-controlled group that accounts for about 20 per cent of the global 
potash market, sold $2.4bn abroad last year, while state oil group Belneftekhim made $4.2bn from export revenues 
from January to the end of November.
EU reaches deal on Belarus sanctions Austrian compromise Bloc agrees penalties forced landing and arrest of 
dissident and partner
Financial sanctions will target activities including securities trading, money market instruments and export credits, 
diplomats said. There is a proposed carve-out for private bank deposits and humanitarian transactions.
Austria's initial opposition to the planned finance measures had angered some fellow member states, especially 
given the large role of Austrian banks in international financial transactions involving Belarus. But Vienna insisted it 
just wanted to craft the package to cause as little damage as possible to the Belarusian people - and to avoid 
pushing Minsk deeper into the Kremlin's orbit.
"It is of high importance for Austria that financial sanctions do not target the population of Belarus," the foreign 
ministry said in a statement before the compromise was agreed. "It is in our common interest that Belarus is not 
pushed even further into the sphere of influence of Russia."
The proposed EU package also closes what one diplomat described as "last loopholes" in an existing arms 
embargo, including a halt to the export of precision rifles used by biathletes.
The measures have some overlaps with proposals set out by the Belarusian opposition last month.
Yesterday, Belarus's exiled opposition leader, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, said sanctions needed to be strong 
enough to "send a message" that the EU would continue to put pressure on Lukashenko's regime until "all political 
prisoners have been freed".
"The EU cannot allow itself to be divided. The regime is trying to see how far they can go." she told the FT.

The measures are expected to win formal political agreement from the European bloc's foreign ministers on

Highlight: London City Airport (LCY) in the UK has teamed up with Collinson to introduce a new, bigger Covid-19 
testing facility at its premise.
Body
Located close to the airport terminal, this new facility will have the capacity to conduct more than 200 tests per hour. 
As a result, the airport will be able to handle increased demand from passengers when the UK Government restarts 
international travel. The London City facility will provide all the government-approved Covid-19 testing solutions. 
Travellers coming from amber-listed nations will be offered a same-day Test to Release service, allowing them to 
end their quarantine on day five after testing negative. While a Lateral Flow Antigen test will cost around $45.85 
(£33), around $91.71 (£66) will be charged for PCR testing. The passengers will be able to avail of the same-day 
result LAMP tests for about $94.49 (£68). The facility's services are available for travellers flying to and from the 
airport. At present, passengers flying to 'Green' and Amber' nations need to take numerous tests before their 
departure and on their arrival. Those returning from 'Amber' countries are also required to fulfil a pre-departure 
testing obligation before arriving in the UK. Prior to their UK departure, passengers can place orders for their test kit 
and book their appointment at least three full working days in advance. Thereafter, passengers are required to 
complete their test through video consultation with a medical practitioner up to 72 hours before their return flight for 
obtaining applicable certification via email. Manchester Airports Group (MAG) in the UK teamed up with Irish airline 
company Ryanair to launch a legal action against the government over the travel traffic light system. The UK 
Government introduced the traffic light system, which rates countries as green, amber or red based on their Covid 
risk.

Newsflow on travel reopening is likely to drive low-cost airline shares higher says HSBC, which has moved Ryanair 
PLC (LON:RYA) and easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) on to its buy list.
While travel has lagged the reopening progress elsewhere, HSBC sees that changing as the EU has now agreed 
on the Digital COVID Certificate to facilitate movement within the EU.
The EU is also opening up to visitors from outside the EU, subject to vaccinations or testing, while the broker 
expects the UK also to relax restrictions though it says policy here is harder to predict.
"We think the US may soon rescind its Executive Order banning UK and EU travellers entering the US.
"We see the EU moving fast to reopen the US-EU market. This could prompt the opening of the US-UK market. 
Once the US is defined as a green territory under the UK traffic light system, we would see pressure to open 
European destinations."
HSBC's target price for Ryanair rises to (EURO)19 from (EURO)16.75, on easyJet to 1,200p from 1,00p and on 
Wizzair (LON:WIZZ), which moves up to hold, to 4,500p from 4,000p.

Operators of Boeing's controversial 737 Max planes will have to carry out repeated tests on its flight control 
systems, US regulator the FAA stipulated.
The plane was grounded around the world in March 2020 after two fatal crashes linked to its flight control systems.
The FAA directive said airlines must  "revise their existing maintenance programmes to include three additional 
repetitive inspections".
"Specific electric checks" must also be carried out on aircraft with more than 6,000h of flight "to verify the correct 
operation of the aeroplane's automated flight control system", the FAA said.
The FAA's directives were published just as Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) took receipt of its first plane in an order of 210 
MAX's.
The airline has been a consistent supporter of the aircraft in spite of the two fatal crashes and was enthusiastic 
about its potential yesterday.
In a statement, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said he was delighted to take delivery of its first new 
technology 'Gamchanger' aircraft.
"These new Boeing 737 aircraft will help Ryanair lower costs, cut fuel consumption and lower noise and CO2 
emissions.

"Each B737 aircraft offers 197 seats (compared to our 189-seat current 737 fleet)."
Passengers though will have the option of not flying on a 737 MAX if they so choose, he added, though they won't 
get a refund but be transferred to the next available flight on the route.

FTSE 100 gave back some of its recent gains as the US Fed put interest rate rises back on the agenda. While 
commentators said any rise might not be until 2023, it was enough for London's blue-chip index to shed 21 at

Whitbread was the top riser as its said people staycating on holiday in Britain was helping its Premier Inns and 
Beefeater chains recover. Revenues in the first quarter fell by 71% even so.
Double-jabbed tourists could be allowed to travel to amber list countries without quarantining under new 
government plans. According to the telegraph, holidays abroad could open up for vaccinated Britons under plans 
being considered by the Government.
Ryanair is also suing the government over the much-criticised travel traffic light list. Having described it as 
shambles yesterday, the airline's boss Michael O'Leary is heading to court to get it changed with health secretary 
Matt Hancock one of those named on the writ.
Among the small caps, Kodal Minerals PLC (LON:KOD) picked up as it said it is making progress with gold 
exploration programmes in Côte d'Ivoire. The miner is also working on a licence application in Mali.
i3 Energy Plc (LON:i3) is to drill two new 'high return' wells in Wapiti, in western Canada, in the coming weeks. The 
oil and gas company wants to acquire more assets in the area.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) is expecting other airlines and airports will join its High Court challenge against 
the UK government over its traffic light system for international travel.
Hoping to force a relaxation of the rules ahead of the all-important summer holiday season, the Irish budget carrier 
has so far joined up with Stansted airport owner Manchester Airports Group.
Papers will be filed at England's High Court today, in order to seek clarity over the transparency of the system, the 
pair said.
Other airlines are expected to join the legal action.
"The UK's traffic light system has been a complete shambles from the beginning," said Ryanair chief executive 
Michael O'Leary.
"This go-stop-go-stop policy is causing untold damage to the aviation industry and frustrating and upsetting millions 
of British families when they see their holiday plans and family visits disrupted by the government's 
mismanagement of international travel.
"We call on prime minister Boris Johnson to explain the scientific basis behind this system that the government 
seem to make up as they go along and to establish a data-driven transparent model that could restore confidence in 
air travel ahead of the very crucial peak summer months."
A government spokesperson said it cannot comment on legal proceedings.

"We recognise this is a challenging period for the sector, as we seek to balance the timely reopening of 
international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out," the government said in a 
statement.
Ryanair often takes to Europe's courts to try and force its points. 
The Irish airline has filed 16 lawsuits against the European Commission for allowing billions of state aid and national 
government payouts to individual airlines including Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Portugal's TAP 
and Scandinavia's SAS.

Irish airline Ryanair is launching a legal challenge against Britain over its "traffic light" system for international travel, 
hoping to force a relaxation of strict rules that threaten the summer holiday season.
The airline has teamed up with Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and the pair filed legal papers at England's High 
Court on Thursday to seek clarity over the transparency of the system, a MAG spokesperson said.
Other airlines are expected to join the legal action.
With just weeks before the peak July and August travel season when most profits are made, the aviation industry is 
worried about losing another summer to COVID-19 as the British government blocks most travel, meaning more job 
losses and financial strain.
The industry has repeatedly criticised the government's traffic light system for international destinations, saying it is 
unpredictable and doesn't make scientific sense. It says some low risk countries and islands should be open for 
travel.
A government spokesperson said it cannot comment on legal proceedings.
"We recognise this is a challenging period for the sector, as we seek to balance the timely reopening of 
international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out," the government said in a 
statement.
Britain allowed vacations again from May after months of lockdown but discourages travel to popular holiday 
destinations such as Spain, France, Greece and the United States, classifying them as "amber" under its traffic light 
system.
This means travellers must quarantine for 10 days on their return and take multiple COVID-19 tests. Only a handful 
of places are classified as green, and none in the European Union after Portugal was removed at short notice 
earlier in June.
The court papers will argue the British government should clearly explain how it makes decisions on categorising 
countries, given the "dramatic" impact these decisions have on the aviation industry.
Ryanair sues UK over curbs on summer international travel
"The current opaque way that decisions are being made is undermining consumer confidence to book summer 
holidays and makes it impossible for airports, airlines and other travel companies to plan for the recovery of 
international travel," the companies said in a statement to Reuters.
The aviation industry had been counting on Britons to be at the forefront of the resumption in travel, given the 
country has one of the fastest vaccine rollouts in the world.

Turin airport and the whole of Piedmont. It is a great satisfaction to announce the opening of the Ryanair base from 
November 1, 2021, a fundamental step in our collaboration with the Irish company, which historically has always 
been profitable for both the airport and the territory," Turin airport's CEO, Andrea Andorni, said in a statement. "With 
these first two based aircraft, the airport will be able to immediately and significantly expand its offer of connections, 
thus creating the network from/to Turin with the highest number of destinations ever served." Even prior to the 
base's launch, Ryanair was Turin's dominant airline controlling almost 35% of its 34,093 seats/week on offer via 63 
weekly departures out of a weekly total of 196. Budget carrier Blue Air (Romania) (0B, Bucharest Otopeni), which 
also uses the Piedmontese capital as a base, is second with 41 weekly departures proffering 7,749 seats/week 
(22.73%).

Ryanair Holdings has taken delivery of its first, and the world's first, B737-8-200. The first of 210 of the type the Irish 
budget carrier holding has on order from Boeing, EI-HEN (msn 62301) was ferried from Seattle Boeing Field to 
Dublin Int'l on June 16. Overall, Ryanair said that owing to delivery delays, it expects to take just twelve MAX 8-
200s this summer season, split evenly between its Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) and Malta Air (AL, Malta Int'l) 
subsidiaries. "Ryanair expects to take delivery of an additional 50 of these B737 'Gamechanger' aircraft before 
Summer 2022, which will enable the Ryanair Group to rebound strongly, offering new routes, lower fares, and rapid 
traffic recovery to many partner airports across Europe as the tourism industry rebuilds from the devastating impact 
of the Covid19 pandemic in 2020/2021," Michael O'Leary said. The MAX 8-200 will cram in 197 passengers in an 
all-economy class configuration with a luxurious 28 inch seating pitch. 
According to the ch-aviation fleets advanced module, Ryanair Group operates 419 B737-800s at present of which 
its Irish AOC operates 250 while Buzz (RR, Warsaw Modlin) in Poland operates 46 and Malta Air operates 120. 
Lauda Europe (LW, Malta Int'l), in Austria, operates twenty-nine A320-200s and is the only non-Boeing operator in 
the group.

Travel industry anger as Germans flock to Majorca
Travel industry anger as Germans flock to Majorca

The bosses of Jet2, Easyjet and Manchester Airport have criticised the government for not putting the Balearic 
Islands, including Majorca, on the green travel list.
The boss of Jet2 said he was "bewildered" over why they couldn't fly to those destinations.
While UK travel is limited, Germans are flocking to popular holiday spots.
The government said it would continue to explore how to open international travel safely.
Currently very few countries are on the government's green list, which means they are approved for leisure travel, 
requiring less testing and no quarantine on return.
"When you take the UK government's own criteria for deciding where holidaymakers can travel to, and apply it to 
the Balearics, we are left bewildered as to why we cannot fly there," said Jet2 and Jet2 Holidays' chief executive 
Steve Heapy.
What's happening with foreign travel?
Insurers criticised over extent of Covid cover
US eases travel rules for 61 countries, but not UK
Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airport Group (MAG) said EU countries were taking a more positive 
approach to resuming international travel.
"Hundreds of thousands of people from places like Germany are travelling freely and safely to low-risk holiday 
destinations," he said.
MAG has joined with low cost airline Ryanair to launch a legal action against the government over its traffic light 
system, particularly focusing on the lack of transparency over how countries are classified.
The Spanish island of Majorca, a favourite of British tourists for decades, is currently on the amber list; travel there 
is not advised and quarantine is required on return to the UK.
Travel industry anger as Germans flock to Majorca
But rates of the virus are lower there than in the UK and in recent weeks, German tourists have started arriving in 
Majorca in large numbers. German travellers need just a digital pre-registration and either an antigen test or proof 
of vaccination.
Dutch and Belgian tourists are also flying to the Balearics but in fewer numbers than those travelling from Germany.
Palma de Majorca Airport confirmed to the BBC that during May, 397,931 tourists arrived from Germany on 3,363 
flights. In contrast 5,813 UK tourists arrived on 333 flights from UK airports.
Local businesses in the Balearics that usually rely on British tourists and their holiday spending, are feeling their 
absence for a second summer.
Mark Steenson owns Francey O'Connor's, an Irish pub in Ca'n Picafort, a Majorca resort that usually welcomes 
thousands of British holiday-makers.
But with Brits still advised not to travel there, he has begun to gear his trade to those who can.
"I went and got a Borussia Dortmund shirt and had the bar sign redone in German to get the German football fans 
in," said Mr Steenson.
"If it weren't for the Germans, we'd be broke. Ca'n Picafort is rammed with Germans," he said. "It is a joy to see."
But rapid adjustments have had to be made, he says: "I've gone out and bought German beers and I've started 
trying to learn some German words so I can chat to them."
The Germany and France game in the Euro 2020 tournament earlier this week was a big pull and for the first time 
this summer, the terrace at Francey O'Connor's filled up.
But while German visitors are a lifeline for Mark Steenson, the absence of their British counterparts has angered 
Manchester Airport Group boss, Charlie Cornish.
The UK's current traffic light system had not recognised the progress many countries have made in reducing rates 
of the virus, he said.
"The government's lack of transparency is unacceptable and makes operating a business in the travel sector almost 
impossible after what has already been the most challenging year in our history."
Epidemiologists worry that mass travel before more people are fully vaccinated, both in the UK and at holiday 
destinations, will allow the virus to spread more rapidly. And if Covid cases spiral suddenly on holiday islands, it is 
not clear if healthcare systems there are in a position to manage their care.
Added to this, there are now concerns amongst EU nations about the Delta variant now dominant in the UK. The 
EU has not added the UK to its "white list" permitting travel. But this list is only guidance and EU nations can make 
their own decisions.
That's not a pressing issue for most EU governments yet, with the UK's largest tour operators almost completely 
grounded.
But when UK tourists are eventually allowed to travel again, the delays may put them at a price disadvantage, 
according to Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of the Advantage Travel Partnership.
"We are closed for businesses, we really are," she said. "Our counterparts in Germany and Europe are flocking to 
the Med.
"What that will mean is a reduction in product for when we restart, and access to uncompetitive pricing, because 
everyone else will have picked best rates."
Travel industry anger as Germans flock to Majorca
"As an industry it demonstrates that you can't plan an operation at the last minute. But there is no comprehension in 
government of the complexity of this story."
Earlier this week, Easyjet announced it was increasing capacity from Germany to Majorca, to cope with swelling 
holiday demand.
"We've just recently added 150,000 seats from Berlin into Palma to try meet the huge pent-up demand that has 
been released from those restrictions lifting," said Garry Wilson, chief executive of easyJet Holidays.
"It is a shame we can't do the same for UK customers, because we know demand is there."
The government says it is looking at how to reopen international travel, including the idea that travellers who have 
received both doses of the vaccine would not have to quarantine when they return from amber list destinations.
Jesse Norman, financial secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: "We don't want to get left behind by countries 
who are adopting a two-jabs approach if it can be done safely."
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: "Our first priority is protecting the public and saving lives, and the 
traffic light system we have in place categorises countries and territories based on risk, using the latest data.
"As set out in the Global Travel Taskforce, we continue to engage with international partners to explore how we can 
open international travel safely."
Labour said it had repeatedly called for ministers to publish the data and criteria around their traffic light system, but 
they had refused to do so.
Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon added: "When will they deliver on the sector-specific support promised 
for aviation 15 months ago? It's now clearer than ever that this government is actively choosing to turn its back on 
the industry at a time when thousands of jobs are on the line."
Steve Heapy, boss of Jet2 said the continued exclusion of UK tourists risked inflicting long-term damage on the 
travel industry.
"Other nationalities are going, German customers are arriving on jumbo jets that are being put into Majorca and 
hotels are filling up.
"Hotels will give rooms in the future to these other nationalities and British tour operators and customers could be 
squeezed out.
He said he hoped the government would review its decision after reexamining the data on 24 June.
"If that is the case, and Malta, Balearic and Canary Islands continue to have low infection rates, I expect them to be 
on the list. If they are not - I expect an explanation. "

Highlight: Manchester Airports Group (MAG) in the UK has reportedly teamed up with Irish airline company 
Ryanair to launch a legal action against the government over the travel traffic light system.
Body
The UK Government introduced the traffic light system, which rates countries green, amber or red based on their 
Covid risk. By launching a legal challenge, the two companies are seeking more transparency on how the countries 
are being classified. Other airline companies are also expected to join the campaign in order to get a better 
understanding of how countries qualify to make their place in the green list of safe places to visit amid the 
pandemic. 
Both MAG and Ryanair have expressed their concerns about the sudden removal of Portugal, which was included 
in the green list in mid-May. As a result of this, British holidaymakers reportedly had to cut down their trips and fly 
back to the country via extra flights arranged by the airline companies. MAG CEO Charlie Cornish said: "We were 
told the traffic light system would allow people to travel safely, with the right measures in place to manage risk for 
different countries. "But it is now clear the government doesn't trust its own system and that international travel is 
being unfairly scapegoated, with tens of thousands of jobs placed at risk in the process. "Low-risk destinations 
continue to be left off the green list despite clear evidence they are safe to visit. With case rates lower than the UK, 
we simply cannot understand why the likes of the Balearics, the Canaries and some Greek islands do not fall into 
that category." However, the UK Government justified its decision to move Portugal from green to amber, saying it 
was due to an increase in infection rates across the country. The decision was said to have been triggered by the 
emergence of the 'Nepal variant', a mutation of the Delta version of the virus that was first detected in India. The 
government further raised red flags, saying that the available vaccines may not be that effective on the mutation. A 
government spokesperson said: "We recognise this is a challenging period for the sector, as we seek to balance 
the timely reopening of international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out. "We 
have provided £7bn to help support the industry during the pandemic."

EU signals 'negative spiral' in relations with Russia Strategy paper

The EU needs to prepare for a "negative spiral" in relations with Russia, Brussels warned on the day the Russian 
and US presidents held a high-stakes encounter in Geneva.
Vladimir Putin, Russian leader, had deliberately deployed "aggressive actions", said the strategy paper released 
yesterday by the European Commission and the EU's diplomatic service. As a result, "the EU needs to prepare for 
a further downturn of its relations with Russia as the most realistic outlook, for the time being".
The warning came as Putin and Joe Biden, US president, met to tackle their own countries' fraught relations. 
Among the issues on the table were alleged Russian cyber attacks, Moscow's misgivings over Nato's military 
expansion in Europe and the war in Ukraine.
"Our ambition should be to explore paths that could help change the current dynamics gradually into a more 
predictable and stable relationship," the EU paper said.
At the same time, though, the bloc said it would aim to curb the resources the Russian government could use by 
stepping up scrutiny of financial flows from the country and enforcing EU laws to counter criminal activities 
originating there, including ransom attacks.
"We must counter threats and malign actions more systematically," the bloc said, adding that it would step up its 
cyberdefence capacity and counter disinformation work. The bloc was considering rules to "impose costs" on 
perpetrators of co-ordinated disinformation attacks, although these can be hard to attribute.

The document also detailed possible areas for co-operation, including climate change and people-to-people 
exchanges.
The EU is attempting to form a coherent policy on Russia in the face of differing views among its 27 member states. 
EU leaders plan to discuss relations with Russia at a summit this month.
The Baltic states and Poland want to pursue a tough line against the Kremlin, while France favours outreach. 
Germany is set to benefit from the contentious Nord Stream 2 project to pipe in Russian gas, which is near 
completion.
But all member states were angered by Russia's treatment of Josep Borrell, EU foreign policy chief, on a trip to 
Moscow this year. Moscow expelled several European diplomats while he was there.
Separately, EU countries agreed to extend sanctions on Belarus to 78 more people and add seven further entities 
to the current list, diplomats said.
The new travel bans and asset freezes are a response to rights abuses since the disputed election of President 
Alexander Lukashenko last year and the Ryanair flight interception apparently designed to detain opposition activist 
Roman Protasevich.

 A lawsuit filed by Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) and the Manchester Airports Group against the UK government's 
traffic light system for international travel amid COVID-19 gained two other British airlines as interested parties, The 
Telegraph reported Thursday, citing court papers.
International Consolidated Airlines' (IAG.L, IAG.MC) British Airways and Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic have 
joined the Manchester Airports-led lawsuit, according to the report.
The companies demanded further clarity on the government's decision-making process for the addition and removal 
of countries from the lists and challenged the legality of the first review, which led to the removal of Portugal from 
the green list. 
Ryanair's shares jumped more than 3%, and IAG gained almost 2% in London on Thursday's close.

       U.K. stocks fell on Thursday in cautious trade after Federal Reserve officials projected hikes in interest rates by

Ryanair PLC's (LON:RYA) outspoken boss has called for vaccinated travellers to be able to move freely between 
the UK and EU to save the travel industry's summer.
Describing the UK's government's coronavirus travel plans as a shambles, Michael O'Leary said it was time to take 
advantage of the UK's successful vaccine programme "to allow the restoration of free movement of vaccinated UK 
citizens and their families to and from the EU, where Covid case rates are lower than the UK and vaccination rates 
are rising rapidly,"
Ryanair was one of a number of airlines that expressed dismay earlier this month when Portugal was taken off the 
green list meaning travellers have to self-isolate for ten days on their return and take two Covid-19 tests.
"The green list is non-existent because countries such as Malta and Portugal, with lower COVID case numbers than 
the UK and rapidly rising vaccination rates, remain on amber," said O'Leary.
The airline chief executive added that using a vaccine-based approach would at least allow the industry to plan for 
what is left of the summer holiday season.
"It is time for Boris Johnson to end his gross mismanagement of Covid and the recovery from Covid, and take 
advantage of the UK's successful vaccine programme."
Ryanair shares rose by 0.3% to 16.19.

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) is "the greenest airline in Europe" and is expected by analysts at JP Morgan to 
return to net income margins of between 13-15% despite a growing need for European airlines to cut down on 
carbon emissions, according to analysts at JP Morgan.
In a note on Wednesday, the investment bank said the need to reduce CO2 emissions is "a financial headwind" for 
the sector amid the need to invest in new aircraft while also contending with compulsory emissions charges and 
mandatory carbon offsetting by 2027.

However, analysts said airlines with "young, fuel efficient fleets have a clear advantage", noting that Wizz, which 
they rate at 'overweight' with a target price of 5,350p, has the youngest fleet of aircraft among the carriers in its 
coverage.
Despite this, JP Morgan predicted that both Wizz and its rival Ryanair Holdings PLC (LON:RYA) will face "rising 
carbon credit costs" as the European Emissions Trading Systems "penalise fast-growing airlines".
"However, we still expect WIZZ to return to net income margins of 13-15% in the coming years", the bank said.
Shares in Wizz were flat at 4,723p in late morning trading.

Ryanair finally took possession of its first Boeing 737 MAX jet after a delay of more than two years on Wednesday, 
saying that it would have 12 of the 'gamechanger' aircraft in time for this year's summer peak, reports 
www.reuters.com.
The Irish airline is the largest European customer for the jet, which was grounded for 20 months after two fatal 
crashes, with 210 firm orders of the 197-seat MAX200 model.
Ryanair was initially due to take delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX two years ago
"We are delighted to take delivery of our first new technology Gamechanger aircraft," Group Chief Executive 
Michael O'Leary said in an emailed statement.
The aircraft registered to Ryanair was expected to land on Wednesday afternoon in Dublin, after the airline took 
possession of it earlier in Seattle.
Ryanair said it expected to take delivery of 12 Boeing 737-8200s this summer, with 6 delivered in Ryanair colours 
and 6 in Malta Air colours. It expects an additional 50 to be delivered before summer 2022.
The airline has announced repeated delays to the arrival of the jet in its fleet, cutting its planned deliveries in time 
for use in summer 2021 from 40 to 16 to possibly zero.
In May, Ryanair said it feared it would not take delivery of the first 737 MAX aircraft until after its peak summer 
period and that the airline was "quite upset with Boeing".

Eurowings to open Prague base in 4Q21

Eurowings (EW, Düsseldorf Int'l) is continuing its strategy of expanding beyond its core German-speaking markets 
and will open a base at Prague Václav Havel airport on October 31, 2021. The Lufthansa Group low-cost carrier will 
initially base two A320-200s out of the Czech capital, increasing to three for the Summer 2022 season. "Eurowings 
will offer non-stop connections to Czech business travellers and vacationers alike - just in time for the relaunch of 
air traffic after the longlasting Corona crisis," Chief Executive Jens Bischof said. Outside of its home German 
market, the carrier already has bases at Palma de Mallorca, Salzburg, and Pristina airports but said earlier this year 
that it was actively looking for opportunities to grow its pan-European footprint. 
At that time, Bischof, while short of naming any cities, identified the Nordics and Eastern Europe as particularly 
attractive markets. According to the ch-aviation PRO airports module, in terms of large scheduled carriers, Prague 
currently hosts crew bases for Buzz (a unit of Ryanair Holdings), CSA Czech Airlines, and Smartwings (Czechia). 
However, CSA is a shadow of its former self as it is currently in bankruptcy proceedings and operates just one 
A319-100 and one A320-200, having a mere 5.1% market share by weekly scheduled capacity at the airport. Even 
though it recently secured court approval to proceed with restructuring, its future remains uncertain. Its parent, 
Smartwings, focuses on the leisure market, leaving Ryanair as Eurowings' main competitor in Prague. While 
Eurowings did not provide a full list of destinations it plans to serve from its Prague base, it did confirm that its 
network from the Czech city would include Barcelona El Prat, Milan Malpensa, Athens Int'l, Stockholm Arlanda, 
Copenhagen Kastrup, Tel Aviv Ben Gurion, and Birmingham Int'l. It currently operates to Prague only from 
Düsseldorf Int'l but will restart services from Hamburg Helmut Schmidt in August 2021, the ch-aviation schedules 
module shows.

UN Aviation Agency To Release Ryanair Diversion Interim Report Next Week
UN Aviation Agency To Release Ryanair Diversion Interim Report Next Week

 The UN aviation agency said Wednesday it will release an interim report next week on the diversion of a Ryanair 
flight by Belarus that caused a global outcry. 
The United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization last month launched a "fact-finding investigation" into 
the forced grounding of the Athens to Vilnius flight, which was carrying dissident Belarus journalist Roman 
Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who were subsequently arrested after the plane landed. 
"An interim report will be presented to the ICAO Council by the end of its current session, on or near 23 June," the 
ICAO said in a statement. 
The Montreal-based agency said Belarus and Poland have provided some "preliminary details" for the ongoing 
probe, while the ICAO continues to seek information from Greece, Ireland, Lithuania and Switzerland.

A final report is expected to be submitted to the ICAO Council -- a governing body made up of 36 member states -- 
in September. 
On May 23, Belarusian traffic controllers told Ryanair pilots to divert the plane, citing a bomb threat that proved to 
be false and scrambling a military jet to accompany the plane. 
It was forced to land in Minsk where Protasevich and Sapega were arrested. 
 Britain and the European Union responded by telling airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and banning the ex-
Soviet country's flagship carrier Belavia.

EU to add dozens of names to Belarus sanctions list
EU to add dozens of names to Belarus sanctions list

The EU states have agreed on another extensive package of sanctions to be slapped on supporters of Belarusian 
President Alexander Lukashenko.Seventy-eight individuals are to be hit with measures like EU travel bans or 
having assets located in the bloc frozen following an agreement by representatives of member states on 
Wednesday, EU sources told dpa.At least seven entities such as state institutions or companies, are also to be 
targeted, according to the same sources.
Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU had already adopted several 
packages of sanctions targeting Lukashenko's supporters last year, as well as the president himself.
There have been mass protests against Lukashenko ever since an August 2020 presidential election that the EU 
believes was neither free nor fair.
Last month, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius to make a 
stopover in Minsk and arrested the government critic Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega on board.
The EU then imposed fresh sanctions on the former Soviet republic, and since early June, Belarusian airlines are 
no longer allowed to fly into EU airspace.
Most of the targets in the sanctions package agreed on Wednesday are accused of helping to repress 
demonstrators, opposition figures or journalists, but others were chosen for a link to the Ryanair flight diversion.

Belarus is "weaponising" migration by sending illegal immigrants from Iraq and Syria across the border to Lithuania, 
according to the Baltic country's foreign minister.
Gabrielius Landsbergis told the Financial Times that Belarus was engaged in a "hybrid attack against Europe" by 
enticing the migrants with package deals from a state-owned tourist agency that included flights from Baghdad or 
Istanbul, as well as travel to the Lithuanian border. So far this year, Lithuania has detained almost double the 
migrants who crossed the frontier from Belarus than the combined total for the three previous years.
"This is weaponised migration that is directly aimed at Lithuania. The reason? It's quite easy to guess. We are 
outspoken, we shelter the main opposition leaders [from Belarus]," Landsbergis said.
Lithuania has been on high alert since Belarus last month forced the landing of a Ryanair plane from Athens to 
Vilnius and then seized prominent dissident Roman Protasevich, who had been living in exile in the Baltic country.
Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko threatened last month that his country could relax some controls on its 
borders, as tensions with the west mounted. "We stopped drugs and migrants; now you will eat and catch them 
yourselves," he warned during an address in the Belarusian parliament.
Landsbergis said that Tsentrkurort, a
Belarus accused of 'weaponising' migration Lithuania allegations Vilnius claims 'hybrid attack' is linked to Baltic 
nation's anti-Minsk stance
Belarusian state-owned tourist agency, was using Boeing 777 planes to bring in migrants and claimed there were 
currently 1,000 Iraqis and Syrians in Minsk. Lithuania has stopped 387 migrants at the Belarusian border up until 
June 14, up from 74 last year. "This is the direction it might be going, to test the country, to test Europe," he added.
Belarus's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Tsentrkurort.
Franak Viacorka, an adviser to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is also in Lithuania, 
said the approach taken by Lukashenko was unsurprising.
"Lukashenko's job right now is to take revenge," he told the FT. "But he has such limited opportunities to take 
revenge, that he is trying to create some problems on the border because that is the only leverage he has."
Landsbergis called Lithuania "the country of freedom fighters" and said it would soon need help from the rest of
Europe to deal with the migrants. Vilnius is already in discussions with Turkey, a fellow member of Nato, about 
stepping up border and identity checks.
He added that, after the "hijacking" of the Ryanair plane, Lithuania was not ruling out any action from Belarus, 
including the targeting of Belarusian dissidents inside the Baltic country.
"Now we are in a position where we have to consider everything. [Lukashenko] crossed a red line a long time ago. 
We have to be really vigilant," Landsbergis said. But he added that Lithuania would not change its outspoken policy 
against the Lukashenko regime.
"They've been testing the means, and they've been testing the methods, and now they're weaponising it," 
Lithuania's foreign minister said.

"They've been testing the means, and they've been testing the methods, and now they're weaponising it," 
Lithuania's foreign minister said.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) and the Manchester Airports Group will take legal action against the UK government's 
traffic light system for international travel amid COVID-19, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing a statement.
The budget airline and the owner of three airports in England intend to seek clarification on the government's 
methodology for adding countries to the red, amber and green categories.
"The current opaque way that decisions are being made is undermining consumer confidence to book summer 
holidays and makes it impossible for airports, airlines and other travel companies to plan for the recovery of 
international travel," the companies said.
Ryanair's stock was up almost 1% on Wednesday's close.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary called the British government's traffic light 
system a "shambles" and asked for a practical approach to resuming international travel, Sky News reported 
Wednesday.
O'Leary said the green travel list was "non-existent" as countries with lower COVID-19 cases were on the amber list 
and vaccinated UK citizens continued to face restrictions for traveling to and from the European Union.
"It is time for Boris Johnson to end his gross mismanagement of COVID and the recovery from COVID, and take 
advantage of the UK's successful vaccine program," O'Leary said.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said keeping a ban on Belarusian airspace is not a 
long-term solution as the industry depends on unrestricted airspace, Reuters reported Tuesday.
O'Leary said the UK and European authorities need to instead secure assurances from Belarusian or Russian 
authorities "that this will never happen again."
The UK and European Union asked their airlines to avoid Belarusian air space unless in an emergency, while 
Belarusian airlines were barred from using British and European airspaces and airports.
The bans follow a forced landing by Belarus of a Ryanair flight in May on the pretext of an alleged bomb threat.
Ryanair's stock climbed almost 1% on Tuesday's close.

 The UN aviation agency said Wednesday it will release an interim report next week on the diversion of a Ryanair 
flight by Belarus that caused a global outcry. 
 The United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization last month launched a 'fact-finding investigation' into 
the forced grounding of the Athens to Vilnius flight, which was carrying dissident Belarus journalist Roman 
Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who were subsequently arrested after the plane landed. 
 'An interim report will be presented to the ICAO Council by the end of its current session, on or near 23 June,' the 
ICAO said in a statement. 
 The Montreal-based agency said Belarus and Poland have provided some 'preliminary details' for the ongoing 
probe, while the ICAO continues to seek information from Greece, Ireland, Lithuania and Switzerland. 
 A final report is expected to be submitted to the ICAO Council — a governing body made up of 36 member states 
— in September. 
 On May 23, Belarusian traffic controllers told Ryanair pilots to divert the plane, citing a bomb threat that proved to 
be false and scrambling a military jet to accompany the plane. 
 It was forced to land in Minsk where Protasevich and Sapega were arrested. 
 Britain and the European Union responded by telling airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace and banning the ex-
Soviet country's flagship carrier Belavia.

LONDON (AP) — The pilot of a Ryanair flight that was diverted to Belarus last month, leading to the arrest of a 
dissident Belarusian journalist, had no alternative but to land the plane in Minsk, the head of the budget airline said 
Tuesday.
Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary appeared before a British Parliament committee to give evidence on the May 23 
diversion. The scheduled flight from Greece to Lithuania changed course and landed in Belarus' capital. Opposition 
journalist Raman Pratasevich, who had been a passenger on the plane, was arrested.
O'Leary told British lawmakers that Minsk air traffic control warned the flight crew of a “credible threat” that if the 
plane entered Lithuanian airspace, “a bomb on board would be detonated.”
The captain repeatedly asked to communicate with Ryanair’s operations control center, but Minsk air traffic officials 
told him — falsely — that “Ryanair weren’t answering the phone," O'Leary said.
“This was clearly a premeditated breach of all the international aviation rules, regulations, safety,” he said.
O’Leary said the pilot was put under “considerable pressure” to land in Belarus instead of the more standard 
options of Poland or other Baltic countries.
“He wasn’t instructed to do so, but he wasn’t left with any great alternatives,” he told members of the Parliament 
committee.
After the plane was on the ground, several “unidentified persons” boarded the aircraft with video cameras, 
according to O'Leary.
They “repeatedly attempted to get the crew to confirm on video that they had voluntarily diverted to Minsk," the 
Ryanair executive said. The crew refused to provide such confirmation, he said.
Western countries have called the forced diversion a brazen “hijacking” by Belarus. Outraged European Union 
leaders swiftly slapped sanctions on the country, including banning Belarusian airlines from using the airspace and 
airports of the 27-nation bloc and telling European airlines to skirt Belarus. U.K. authorities took similar actions.
Ryanair CEO says diverted flight had to land in Belarus
O’Leary said he did not support continuing such flight bans in the long term.
“We cannot have a situation whereby airlines, air travel, our customers and our citizens run the risk of being 
hijacked and diverted under false pretenses,” he said. “But equally, far more U.K. citizens will be disrupted as a 
result of long-haul flights between the U.K. and Asia, for example, now having to fly around Belarus or avoiding 
Belarusian airspace.”

Bucharest officials pledge to rename street after Belarusian dissident Protasevich
Bucharest officials pledge to rename street after Belarusian dissident

Jun 15, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 In Bucharest, Romania, a street where the Belarusian embassy is situated will carry the name of arrested journalist 
Roman Protasevich, writes Cristian Gherasim, Bucharest correspondent. 
Protasevich, well known critic of Lukashenko's regime, was arrested after his Ryanair flight from Greece to 
Lithuania was diverted to Minsk. 
The initiative to rename the street which accommodates the Belarusian embassy came from Bucharest university 
professor Andrei Oi￿teanu. His online proposal went viral and got picked up by the mayor of Bucharest's District 1 
where the embassy is situated. 
The mayor believes renaming the street outside Belarus's embassy would send a clear message to Lukashenko's 
regime that human rights abuses will not be tolerated by the international community. The procedure would need 
city council approval. The city official thinks that the name change could happened within a month's time if all goes 
well. 
Usually the process takes longer since residents oppose such changes due of additional hassle linked to having 
their IDs changed as well. But in this case, nobody lives on that street so the process should be straightforward. 
If enacted, the change would mean that all Belarus embassy employees would have Roman Protasevich Street on 
their correspondence as well as on their business cards. 
The campaign garnered support from some members of the European Parliament as well, urging other countries to 
follow Bucharest's lead. 
Bucharest officials pledge to rename street after Belarusian dissident Protasevich
In Bucharest, the campaign to rename a street after Roman Protasevich was also accompanied by protests held in 
front of the embassy of Belarus. 
Romanian protesters wrapped themselves in the red and white flag of the Belarusian opposition, and displayed a 
huge banner calling for the release of journalist Roman Protasevici and his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. 
The protests in Romania are part of a series of events in several European capitals marking a global day of 
solidarity with the Belarusian opposition, called for by exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tshanovskaia. 
Belarus has been facing street protests since Lukashenko declared himself the winner of last August's election, 
which the Opposition and the West say have been rigged. 
According to the Belarusian Association of Journalists, 481 journalists were arrested in 2020, twice as many as in 
the last six years, including Roman Protasevici. 
Roman Protasevich has been a vocal critic of autocratic Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko for the past 10 
years. Now, following his uncanny arrest by grounding the plane he was travelling in, Europe's aviation regulator 
issued a report calling for all airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace for safety reasons. 
The forced grounding of the Ryanair flight in order to arrest Roman Protasevich had put in question the ability to 
provide safe skies in Europe. 
EU foreign ministers are discussing possible economic sanctions, and the United States said that it would re-
impose sanctions on nine state-owned enterprises in Belarus on June 3.

What the Biden-Putin summit has to do with China

 After a low point in US-Russian relations, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be 
meeting face-to-face. China is one of the reasons.Biden wants to spend time in a room with Putin and the 
translators to better understand what drives the Russian president and what the real issues are, said Ian Bremmer, 
a US foreign affairs expert and Time magazine columnist. That's very important for him, it's where his empathy 
comes from — if Biden has a superpower, that is it, the columnist told DW. 
By February 2021, relations between the two nuclear powers had reached a 30-year low. Biden had called Putin a 
killer, which triggered outrage in Moscow. Suddenly, however, things changed and plans were made for a private 
meeting in a neutral space, in Switzerland. 
The US seeks to normalize relations with Russia — mainly because of China, according to Raimund Krmer, who 
teaches international politics at the University of Potsdam. "The main focus of Biden's European trip serves the 
greater goal of forging alliances against China," he told DW, adding that much is evident in the G7, NATO and EU 
summits as well as in the meeting with the Russian president. 
The list of topics up for debate between Biden and Putin is long: disarmament treaties, the Ukraine conflict, Syria, 
Iran's nuclear program, Libya, Afghanistan. Not to mention human rights violations, the suppression of the free 
press and opposition in Russia, pro-government hacking attacks, and the hijacking of the Ryanair plane by Russia's 
ally Belarus. One topic will not be on the agenda, although it has become the focus of American foreign policy: 
China. 
Bremmer said that while it is unlikely Biden and Putin will talk directly about China, it is clear the US sees China as 
a key antagonist on the global stage, which in turn influences US strategy with respect to Russia. 
US favors steady relationship with Russia 
The ongoing confrontation between the United States and the People's Republic of China came to a head shortly 
before Biden's trip to Europe. Three days before the G7 summit, the US announced it would approve a trade 
agreement with Taiwan — a provocation for China. A day later, the US Senate passed a $244 billion (€201 billion) 
package of legislation to combat China's technological dominance. One day before the summit, US Defense 
Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Pentagon to bring more of a focus on strategy on China. 
Biden doesn't like Putin, nor does he think Russia is of incredible strategic value, but the reality of US-China 
relations means that we would rather not have big problems with the Russians, Bremmer said. 
Ralf Fücks, director of the Berlin-based Center for Liberal Modernity think tank, takes a similar view, arguing that 
clearly, "China is present in the background." The US has no interest in escalating the conflict with Moscow, the 
What the Biden-Putin summit has to do with China
Russia expert added. "It's really just a side issue for them that interupts their attempts to consolidate their strategic 
positions vis-a-vis Beijing," he said, adding that it's a strategic option for Putin to expand cooperation with China, 
which he has already started doing. 
Getting too close to China is 'dangerous for Russia' 
Since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow and Beijing have strengthened their bilateral ties. The 
halt of a significant portion of foreign direct investment in Russia was an immediate consequence of western 
sanctions. Attempts to offset that loss by turning to China have been only partially successful. The Russian 
economy has been stagnating for years. Real incomes are falling, while frustration among the population is on the 
rise. 
Russia is trying to participate in China's economic growth. New pipelines to China are under construction and 
Russia has been supplying the Chinese with modern weapons systems that Beijing is not getting from the West. 
"Russia is helping the Chinese build a military satellite defense system," according to Sarah Pagung of the German 
Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). "But they are very cautious because in the end, of course, they don't want 
the Chinese to simply copy military technology that the Russians have developed and then become independent," 
the DGAP Russia expert argued. 
It is the authoritarian common ground that drives Putin to Xi Jinping's side, said Ralf Fücks of the Center for Liberal 
Modernity. "There is, in effect, a new international of authoritarian powers that see a common opponent in liberal 
democracy and the liberal world order." Russia, he added, fears China more than it sees China as a strategic 
partner. 
"Getting too close to China is dangerous for Russia," Victoria Zhuravleva, the head of North American studies at 
Russia's University of Human Sciences in Moscow, told DW. The United States could provide a counterweight to 
China for Russia to move between, the political scientist said, adding that could be a way of balancing the two 
powers. 
Walking the seesaw of power politics is the position Russia seems to seek, a center among many in a multi-polar 
world. "Russia's favorite position is still that of a kind of mediator between Asia and the West," said Katharina 
Bluhm, director of the Institute for Eastern European Studies at Freie Universitt Berlin. "The mediator role is an 
illusion today, partly because China is unlikely to grant it to Russia." 
We don't know what the Chinese government thinks about the meeting, said Yawei Liu, a China expert with the 
Carter Center thinktank , adding that unrest is increasing among Chinese academics on social media. Biden's 
decision to meet Putin worries the Chinese, he said, it is a smart move. The US will find it increasingly difficult to 
deal with Russia and China at the same time, according to Yawei Liu, so the motto is "divide and rule." 
Biden's messages to Russia and Europe 
Not all experts feel confrontation with China is what drives Biden's summit with Putin, however. Kristine Berzina of 
the German Marshall Fund said the main purpose of Biden's entire European trip is a show of solidarity with US 
allies. Russia, she said, is perceived as a destabilizing force. "The priority will be to signal that the US will not 
continue to accept Russia's increasingly threatening and belligerent behavior," Berzina said. 
The United States may be focused on China, but Washington is aware that Russia is capable of wreaking 
significant havoc and destabilizing Western democracies in Europe and America in the process," said Torrey 
Taussig of the Harvard Kennedy School. 
However, the simple fact that he is invited to a meeting is a major domestic political success for Putin, said Pagung, 
who added that the Russian media portray it as a kind of "recognition of Russia's great power status." Putin, the 
DGAP expert said, has nothing to lose. Biden, on the other hand, will have to make his position on Russia crystal 
clear and point out Russian wrongdoing in order to be successful.

 In this May 23, 2021, file photo provided by ONLINER.BY, security use a dog to check the luggage of passengers 
on the Ryanair jet that carried opposition figure Raman Pratasevich, traveling from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania. 
Dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich, arrested when Belarus diverted his flight said in a video from prison 
released Wednesday June 3, 2021, asserted that he has been set up by an unidentified associate. No bomb was 
found after the landing, but Pratasevich was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend. (ONLINER.BY via AP) 
LONDON (AP) — The pilot of a Ryanair flight that was diverted to Belarus last month, leading to the arrest of a 
dissident Belarusian journalist, had no alternative but to land the plane in Minsk, the head of the budget airline said 
Tuesday.  
 Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary appeared before a British Parliament committee to give evidence on the May 23 
diversion. The scheduled flight from Greece to Lithuania changed course and landed in Belarus' capital. Opposition 
journalist Raman Pratasevich, who had been a passenger on the plane, was arrested.  
 O'Leary told British lawmakers that Minsk air traffic control warned the flight crew of a 'credible threat' that if the 
plane entered Lithuanian airspace, 'a bomb on board would be detonated.'  
 The captain repeatedly asked to communicate with Ryanair's operations control center, but Minsk air traffic officials 
told him — falsely — that 'Ryanair weren't answering the phone," O'Leary said.  
 'This was clearly a premeditated breach of all the international aviation rules, regulations, safety,' he said. 
 O'Leary said the pilot was put under 'considerable pressure' to land in Belarus instead of the more standard 
options of Poland or other Baltic countries.  
 'He wasn't instructed to do so, but he wasn't left with any great alternatives,' he told members of the Parliament 
committee.  
 After the plane was on the ground, several 'unidentified persons' boarded the aircraft with video cameras, 
according to O'Leary. 
 They 'repeatedly attempted to get the crew to confirm on video that they had voluntarily diverted to Minsk," the 
Ryanair executive said. The crew refused to provide such confirmation, he said.  
 Western countries have called the forced diversion a brazen 'hijacking' by Belarus. Outraged European Union 
leaders swiftly slapped sanctions on the country, including banning Belarusian airlines from using the airspace and 
airports of the 27-nation bloc and telling European airlines to skirt Belarus. U.K. authorities took similar actions. (Ad) 
Ryanair CEO says diverted flight had to land in Belarus
Experts say this technology could change everything for the retail cannabis market. So, if you were late last time, 
check this out now!  
 O'Leary said he did not support continuing such flight bans in the long term.  
 'We cannot have a situation whereby airlines, air travel, our customers and our citizens run the risk of being 
hijacked and diverted under false pretenses,' he said. 'But equally, far more U.K. citizens will be disrupted as a 
result of long-haul flights between the U.K. and Asia, for example, now having to fly around Belarus or avoiding 
Belarusian airspace.'

7 Precious Metals Stocks That Will Keep Your Portfolio On Trend[2] The growing acceptance of cryptocurrency is 
beginning to make mainstream investors rethink their idea of 'store of value.' The trendy possibilities of Bitcoin, 
Ethereum, and any of the dozens of altcoins that exist on the blockchain are trending like the latest fashion. 
 However, the thing about fashion is that the more things change the more things stay the same. Just like the 
simple black dress that won't go out of fashion, the same can be said for precious metals stocks. One way to think 
about it would be to say that the existence of a growing cryptocurrency market doesn't change the value of precious 
metals. 
 Precious metals have long been known to be a safe-haven asset in times of market volatility and economic crisis. 
In fact, during the Covid-19 pandemic, gold prices surged about 30% breaking the $2,000 mark for the first time in 
its history. This was at a time when the prices of many cryptocurrencies were falling. 
 And precious metals have also been seen as a hedge against inflation, which seems like more of a certainty with 
the Federal Reserve's pledge to keep interest rates at historically low rates into 2023. 
 Whether you're looking to take your first steps at crafting a precious metals portfolio or if you want to fine-tune the 
one you have, we believe this special presentation is a good place to start your research. We've identified seven 
precious metals stocks that look to retain their allure in 2021.

What the Biden-Putin summit has to do with China

 After a low point in US-Russian relations, US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be 
meeting face-to-face. China is one of the reasons.Biden wants to spend time in a room with Putin and the 
translators to better understand what drives the Russian president and what the real issues are, said Ian Bremmer, 
a US foreign affairs expert and Time magazine columnist. That's very important for him, it's where his empathy 
comes from — if Biden has a superpower, that is it, the columnist told DW. 
By February 2021, relations between the two nuclear powers had reached a 30-year low. Biden had called Putin a 
killer, which triggered outrage in Moscow. Suddenly, however, things changed and plans were made for a private 
meeting in a neutral space, in Switzerland. 
The US seeks to normalize relations with Russia — mainly because of China, according to Raimund Krmer, who 
teaches international politics at the University of Potsdam. "The main focus of Biden's European trip serves the 
greater goal of forging alliances against China," he told DW, adding that much is evident in the G7, NATO and EU 
summits as well as in the meeting with the Russian president. 
The list of topics up for debate between Biden and Putin is long: disarmament treaties, the Ukraine conflict, Syria, 
Iran's nuclear program, Libya, Afghanistan. Not to mention human rights violations, the suppression of the free 
press and opposition in Russia, pro-government hacking attacks, and the hijacking of the Ryanair plane by Russia's 
ally Belarus. One topic will not be on the agenda, although it has become the focus of American foreign policy: 
China. 
Bremmer said that while it is unlikely Biden and Putin will talk directly about China, it is clear the US sees China as 
a key antagonist on the global stage, which in turn influences US strategy with respect to Russia. 
US favors steady relationship with Russia 
The ongoing confrontation between the United States and the People's Republic of China came to a head shortly 
before Biden's trip to Europe. Three days before the G7 summit, the US announced it would approve a trade 
agreement with Taiwan — a provocation for China. A day later, the US Senate passed a $244 billion (€201 billion) 
package of legislation to combat China's technological dominance. One day before the summit, US Defense 
Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Pentagon to bring more of a focus on strategy on China. 
Biden doesn't like Putin, nor does he think Russia is of incredible strategic value, but the reality of US-China 
relations means that we would rather not have big problems with the Russians, Bremmer said. 
Ralf Fücks, director of the Berlin-based Center for Liberal Modernity think tank, takes a similar view, arguing that 
clearly, "China is present in the background." The US has no interest in escalating the conflict with Moscow, the 
What the Biden-Putin summit has to do with China
Russia expert added. "It's really just a side issue for them that interupts their attempts to consolidate their strategic 
positions vis-a-vis Beijing," he said, adding that it's a strategic option for Putin to expand cooperation with China, 
which he has already started doing. 
Getting too close to China is 'dangerous for Russia' 
Since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Moscow and Beijing have strengthened their bilateral ties. The 
halt of a significant portion of foreign direct investment in Russia was an immediate consequence of western 
sanctions. Attempts to offset that loss by turning to China have been only partially successful. The Russian 
economy has been stagnating for years. Real incomes are falling, while frustration among the population is on the 
rise. 
Russia is trying to participate in China's economic growth. New pipelines to China are under construction and 
Russia has been supplying the Chinese with modern weapons systems that Beijing is not getting from the West. 
"Russia is helping the Chinese build a military satellite defense system," according to Sarah Pagung of the German 
Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP). "But they are very cautious because in the end, of course, they don't want 
the Chinese to simply copy military technology that the Russians have developed and then become independent," 
the DGAP Russia expert argued. 
It is the authoritarian common ground that drives Putin to Xi Jinping's side, said Ralf Fücks of the Center for Liberal 
Modernity. "There is, in effect, a new international of authoritarian powers that see a common opponent in liberal 
democracy and the liberal world order." Russia, he added, fears China more than it sees China as a strategic 
partner. 
"Getting too close to China is dangerous for Russia," Victoria Zhuravleva, the head of North American studies at 
Russia's University of Human Sciences in Moscow, told DW. The United States could provide a counterweight to 
China for Russia to move between, the political scientist said, adding that could be a way of balancing the two 
powers. 
Walking the seesaw of power politics is the position Russia seems to seek, a center among many in a multi-polar 
world. "Russia's favorite position is still that of a kind of mediator between Asia and the West," said Katharina 
Bluhm, director of the Institute for Eastern European Studies at Freie Universitt Berlin. "The mediator role is an 
illusion today, partly because China is unlikely to grant it to Russia." 
We don't know what the Chinese government thinks about the meeting, said Yawei Liu, a China expert with the 
Carter Center thinktank , adding that unrest is increasing among Chinese academics on social media. Biden's

Esken Limited (LON:ESKN) the owner of Southend Airport (LSA) is in late-stage talks about a cash injection from 
private equity firm Carlyle.
The group announced the closure of Stobart Air at the weekend after a planned sale fell through but said today it 
was in talks with an unnamed investor over an injection of funds.
The group later confirmed that the investor is Carlyle, which is set to take a 30% stake in the airport through the 
issue of a convertible bond that would convert into equity over a period of several years.
In a statement, Esken said it is the final stages of agreeing the documentation with Carlyle Global Infrastructure 
Opportunity Fund with regards to a long term strategic funding transaction relating to the development of LSA. 
"Under the proposed terms of the partnership, Carlyle would provide £120mln of funding net of Carlyle costs via a 
loan (convertible at Carlyle's option into an equity stake of 29.99% in LSA), which would release £100m of liquidity 
into the rest of the Group."
Esken in talks over new funding for Southend Airport after Stobart Air collapse
Southend Airport is used by Ryanair and WizzAir but was one of the airports cut when EasyJet retrenched last year.
In its statement this morning Esken said that the financing talks are in the final stages, adding it would release 
significant liquidity for the group.
Esken confirms talks with Carlyle to inject £120mln into Southend Airport
Details are expected with the full-year results later this month and Esken said this funding would allow it to clear its 
outstanding bank debt of £120mln.

The civil aviation sector should not be politicised, Artyom Sikorsky, director of aviation at Belarus' Ministry of 
Transport and Communications, told the Belarusian state-owned channel ONT TV on June 10. "The sanctions the 
Europeans have imposed on us are like a 'toothless bite'. It feels unpleasant and disgusting, but not painful," he 
said, as quoted by the BelTA news agency. According to him, the European Union was primarily causing problems 
for ordinary people, not only in Belarus but from many other countries. "Of course, sanctions are harmful. 
Moreover, they cause harm to all parties. But can we say that the situation is catastrophic? In fact, the situation in 
aviation now is the same as it was in 2020, when the coronavirus began," Sikorsky elaborated. "I believe that when 
our European counterparts introduced the sanctions, they didn't even fully realise what they had done. It is, after all, 
absolutely wrong to politicise aviation security matters. You can understand what the situation may turn out to be - 
tomorrow a wrong decision could be made simply out of being afraid of repercussions, like sanctions or some kind 
of political pressure," he said. As previously reported, Brussels formalised a bloc-wide ban on Belarusian carriers in 
early June in the wake of the forced May 23 diversion to Minsk National of a Ryanair flight from Athens Int'l to 
Vilnius, followed by the arrest of two opposition journalists who were on board. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Japan's 
government decided on June 10 to join the EU and likewise ban all Belarus-flagged carriers and aircraft from 
conducting operations to and over the country, including charters, "even if a request is made," Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference, Kyodo News agency reported. The move is largely symbolic, 
as Japan and Belarus have no direct air connections. It came after the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven 
industrialised nations condemned Belarus' actions. The Japanese government will also make an official 
recommendation to the country's airlines to change their flight paths so that they do not cross the territory of 
Belarus. ANA - All Nippon Airways said it had already followed a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
advisory to avoid Belarusian airspace, while JAL - Japan Airlines said that none of its routes passed over the 
country. "We strongly condemn the forced landing of a civilian aircraft and the arbitrary arrest of a specific 
passenger on board by the Belarusian authorities, and we demand the immediate release of the arrested 
journalist," Kato said.

Three weeks after his arrest, the Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich made another public 
appearance on Monday, although many fear he is being forced to speak under duress.
"I feel great," Protasevich said at a surprise press conference in Minsk. "Nobody has beat me or even touched me," 
the 26-year-old said, laughing and seeming relaxed at the Foreign Ministry-organized event.
Protasevich also addressed his parents, who have been appealing to world leaders for his release and expressing 
fears over his treatment: "Mum, dad, don't worry, everything is fine with me."
Protasevich said while he did not support long-time ruler Alexander Lukashenko, "I respect him as a person."
A journalist who was at the press conference echoed the sentiment of many observers, including Protasevich's 
parents, that she didn't believe one word he was saying.
In the days after his arrest, Protasevich gave an interview to state TV in which he seemed distressed and made 
what appeared to be a coerced confession to instigating mass anti-government protests.
In an incident that sparked international outrage almost three weeks ago, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair 
passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius to stop over in Minsk.
Government critic Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, who were on board the plane, were taken into 
custody at the airport.
On Monday, a court in Minsk dismissed a complaint by Sapega against her detention, the Russian news agency 
TASS reported.
Her lawyers have announced an appeal of the decision, arguing that Belarus was bound by international law to let 
air travellers reach their destination.

 An expert's point of view on a current event. 
 June 14, 2021, 12:20 PM  
 Just after the First World War, the United States started a massive, new operation: academic fellowships for 
foreign students to come and study in the United States. America had just won the war. It was a proud new 
superpower, eager to put itself on the global map for the first time. The idea behind the fellowships was to spread 
that message and inform the world about a country that many, at the time, still knew little about. What better way 
than to invite the world's best and brightest to come and study, and give them a world-class education in the best 
academic tradition while immersing them in the American way of life, ideas, and values? 
 It's time for the European Union to follow this example. It should set up an ambitious, generous program for foreign 
students to study at European universities and use it as a soft power tool. This program should start immediately, 
and right at Europe's doorstep, as a direct European response to President Alexander Lukashenko's hijack of a 
Ryanair flight in May to abduct opposition leader Roman Protasevich: Europe should invite thousands of 
Belarusians to come and study and do research at universities all over Europe. 
 Like America 100 years ago, Europe wants to put itself on the map as a geopolitical actor. In a rapidly changing 
world, with U.S. priorities shifting from Europe to Asia, Europeans are busy discussing new theoretical concepts 
such as 'strategic autonomy.' They understand they need to learn to stand on their own feet and rely less on U.S. 
protection. Many of these discussions involve hard power, with a focus on European security and common defense 
initiatives. 
 But on a continent that has become deeply pacifist over the decades and where European foreign policy remains 
crippled by unanimity rules, hard power will always have it limits. (Just imagine that U.S. foreign policy required 
unanimity in the Senate—and that the Senate was comprised of the collected state governors.) Europe needs to 
make much better use of the soft power tools it has at its disposal, if only because the threshold for such actions is 
lower. Fortunately, many tools are there already, including academic fellowships. The problem is that they are 
hardly used at all. 
 In the case of Belarus, a grant-based fellowship program could be the political gesture that so many Europeans are 
looking for, punishing the regime while helping its citizens. It would be comparable to the brilliant response by the 
Is Europe Any Good at Soft Power?
United Kingdom to the de-facto Chinese takeover of Hong Kong last year: offering tens of thousands of Hong Kong 
citizens the possibility to acquire residence permits in the UK. About 35,000 people have already applied[1] since 
January. 
 Time and again, opinion polls show Europeans are skeptical about European power as it is exerted. They find the 
EU too slow, too weak, and too complex. But when asked what the EUshouldbe, their bitterness often melts away. 
As a recent poll by the European Council on Foreign Relations showed, they have little trouble spelling[2] out what 
they want Europe to be: 'A beacon of democracy and human rights, prioritizing the rule of law and high democratic 
standards.' Just like many Americans 100 years ago, many Europeans think they have a mission in a world full of 
turmoil, and they want to be proud of it. Why not turn this sentiment into a major foreign policy tool, by sharing this 
with the rest of the world—starting with an invitation to thousands of young Belarusian students to study in the EU, 
alongside Belarusian academics who join European research programs? 
 In the 1980s, Joseph Nye coined the term 'soft power'—the ability of a country to persuade others to do what it 
wants without coercion or force. In his 2004 bookSoft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics, he 
calculated[3] that between 1945 and 2000 alone, 700,000 people from around the world had studied in the United 
States on American fellowships. Some American fellowships are organized by public institutions, such as the 
Fulbright Program. But most are private initiatives. Since the First World War, American governments have actively 
encouraged the private sector and charitable organizations such as the Rockefeller Foundation to use fellowships 
to promote American interests abroad. They invite students to study and academics to teach, do master's degrees, 
or take part in prestigious research programs. 
 As the French historian and jazz expert Ludovic Tourns writes in his recent bookAmricanisation; une histoire 
mondiale XVIIIe-XXIe sicles,a brilliant analysis[4] on American influence in the world from the 18th century until 
now, most American fellowship programs are long (running over several years) and generous. Tourns spends an 
entire chapter on the potential of fellowships and other forms of cultural diplomacy 'to conquer hearts and minds.' 
 American fellowships started at a time when European countries were in ruins. France, Germany, and the United 
Kingdom had academic exchange programs and fellowships before the First World War. But they had to 
discontinue them afterwards for lack of funds and teaching staff—with 20 million dead in Europe, it was one of the 
deadliest wars in history. Moreover, the creation of many new countries in Europe and the rise of nationalism led to 
the establishment of new, hard borders that complicated cross-border travel. Right at that point, the United States 
stepped in, rapidly establishing itself as an academic powerhouse. Exchange programs were signed with France 
(1921), Czechoslovakia (1922), Germany (1924), Hungary (1925), and so on. Soon, the United States became a 
prime destination for European students. Asia, Latin America, and other parts of the world followed later. 
 There are many reasons why many Eastern Europeans are pro-American, and remained so even during the Trump 
presidency. The fact that many members of the Eastern European elite speak English with an American accent is 
no coincidence. 
 One of the greatest successes of European integration is the Erasmus exchange program, which enables students 
and professionals to study and practise their trade in another European country for six months. It is massive and 
popular, and is relatively cheap. Each year some students from neighboring third countries, such as Belarus, are 
allowed[5] to participate. In addition, the universities of Warsaw and Vilnius also invite Belarusians to come and 
study, teach, or do research. 
 There have been several appeals in the past few weeks to extend those programs, including one[6] by European 
Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans. But Erasmus fellowships only last six months, and national grants 
in just a few neighboring countries to Belarus are not the same as a strong, common European policy. If Europe 
wants to punish the regime in Belarus without hurting its citizens, it needs to build a massive and more generous 
European program, offering Belarusian citizens the full academic experience at Europe's best universities, bathing 
them in the tradition of independent research and free debate of which Europeans are so proud. 
 This would be a smart and timely move, since Europe does not have many other policy options when it comes to 
Belarus. Lukashenko has burned all bridges with the EU, turning to Russia for help. More European sanctions are 
on the way, but the chances of Lukashenko doing what his people want are extremely slim: He will not move under 
European pressure. This leaves academic fellowships as one the few policy tools the EU has in Belarus. 
 Of course, there are downsides to such an initiative. By now Belarus has put exit restrictions in place, as Hong 
Kong did[7] after the British offer of residency permits. The harder Lukashenko makes it for Belarusians to leave, 
the more his people will treat European scholarships as a way to seek asylum instead of studying. Another risk is 
Minsk placing undercover agents among the students. 
Is Europe Any Good at Soft Power?
 And finally, real 'European Fulbrights' would have to cover several years and should be accompanied by generous 
grants for rent and food. EU member states, used to treating every policy developed by the EU as an opportunity to 
cut corners to save costs, must be persuaded that stinginess would be counterproductive in this case. This program 
must be fully funded, otherwise many Belarusians will not be able to join. The aim is to conquer hearts and minds 
and spread values. The result cannot be the impression that the EU doesn't care enough about democracy and 
human rights in Belarus. 
 Despite these risks and downsides, the idea remains irresistible. European fellowships would be a perfect fit for 
Europe. In the podcastThe Rachman Review, Katia Glod, a Belarusian policy analyst in London, recently 
explained[8] that Belarusian citizens have pinned all their hopes on Europe. They are even supportive of sanctions, 
she said—anything that can bring democracy and the rule of law. If these people do not deserve European 
scholarships, it is difficult to see who does.

Q1 2021 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2] 
Airline Stocks Fall 
Aircraft engine manufacturer Rolls Royce and British Airways owner IAG[3] are the biggest early fallers on the 
FTSE 100 today, with the expectation that continued domestic restrictions are likely to be a sign that quarantine 
rules will also stay in place for longer, pushing back the recovery for the airline sector. Rolls Royce fell by around 
3% and IAG by 2.8% 
David Abrams Explains How To Value Stocks 
Continued from part one... Q1 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc Abrams and his team want to understand 
the fundamental economics of every opportunity because, "It is easy to tell what has been, and it is easy to tell what 
is today, but the biggest deal for the investor is to . . . SORRY! Read More[4] 
 With the travel traffic lights unlikely to change from red and amber any time soon, that's also pushed EasyJet down 
1.8%,. Meanwhile, Wizz Air fell by 1% and Ryanair by 1.3%. 
 The conference organiser Informa is also on the slide today, down 2% with the delay to 'freedom day' seen as yet 
another blow for the company. The events business has been one of the biggest corporate casualties of the 
pandemic, and Informa, the provider of global conferences, has been no exception. It has tried to generate 
revenues from virtual and hybrid events, but they are far from the cash cow that major in person events provide. 
Just Eat Takeaway And Shell Rise 
But stay at home stock Just Eat Takeaway has seen a flurry of interest today, with its share price up around 2% 
amid expectations that our appetite for deliveries will continue. A dollop of interest may also have been added to the 
FTSE 100 - Turbulence For Airlines But Renewed Appetite For Just Eat And Shell Powers Ahead
stock, due to its collaboration with former French football player Eric Cantona for its Euro 2020 ad campaign. TV 
audience figures for the first games so far have been strong. However, one of its tag lines 'freedom draws near'' 
may appear today to be a little premature. 
 Royal Dutch Shell[5] is also gaining strongly today, up by around 2% off the back of higher oil prices and amid 
swirling rumours that it could be about to sell a big chunk of holdings in the US Permian basin, which accounted for 
6% of its oil and gas output last year. It another sign of shifting sands at Shell as it faces increasing investor 
pressure to map its future as the net zero 2050 pledge looms. 
 BT was also one of the top risers today, with a dose of fresh momentum following the purchase of a 12.1% stake in 
the company, by Patrick Drahi's Altice UK. It's a vote of confidence in the group's long term potential and may make 
it easier for BT to raise capital[6] to support the fibre roll-out over the next few years."

UN GATE, June 9 - Right after dissident blogger Pratasevich was grabbed off a Ryan Air flight forced to land in 
Belarus, many including the US spoke. 
 But for more than a full day, nothing from Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General who rarely takes questions 
and even had the Press which asked him about the mass killings in Cameroonthrown out[9]of the UN. Alerthere[10]; 
new Belarus Blues songhere.[11] 
 On June 9, the Committee to Protect Journalists held a Zoom press conference withVolha Siakhovich of BAJon the 
topic, and Inner City Press submitted two questions: 
 "Question from Inner City Press: Do you think the Biden Administration's decision to limit to avague[12]"members 
of the news media doing their jobs" protection against gag orders and surveillance undermine its ability to fully 
pursue the issue of press freedom in Belarus? Likewise, do you think the UN Secretariat's failure to have any 
content neutral media accreditation and access rules undermine the ability of it and those responsible to raise 
Belarus's abuses, to the degree the will to do so exists in anything but the vaguest terms?" 
 The response,photohere,[13]by CPJ'sGypsy Guilln Kaiser,included that CPJ has no comment on the UN's 
accreditation policies. How not, if they cite to and use the UN? In fact, the UN Group of Friends was cited. 
 Will CPJ's solicitude for UN censorship end with its change in leadership, also announced on June 9? Watch this 
site. 
 Late and hypocritical, given that they have done nothing about Guterresbanning[14]Inner City Press now for 1073 
days amid its questions, this: "The co-chairs of the United Nations Group of Friends for the Protection of Journalists 
- Greece, France and Lithuania - and the undersigned Members of the Group of Friends strongly condemn the 
forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, Belarus, on May 23, 2021, prompted by Belarusian authorities in order to 
arrest and detain independent journalist Raman Pratasevich and his companion, Sofia Sapega... 
 There can be no Press Freedom when there is fear. [See seethis[15]andthis[16]at UN.] 
 Signed, Co-chairs of the UN Group of Friends for the Protection of Journalists, Ambassadors, Permanent 
Representatives of Greece, France and Lithuania  
Before Biden Putin Meet, CPJ Q&A on Belarus Has Info But No Comment on UN Press Ban
 Annex: Co-signatories members of the Group of Friends (in alphabetical order): Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, 
Costa Rica, Ghana, Latvia, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, USA, Uruguay." 
 On May 28, Guterres' UN Press Briefing Room hosted a press conference, from which Inner City Press was 
banned, in which the grabbing of Pratasevich was called fake news, in response to questions from state media. 
 Inner City Press has asked then incoming UNSC president for JuneEstonia[17]for access, to which there has been 
no response (ACT is just an act) - and it and the Free UN Coalition for Access (FUNCA) will report on all results.

Mother of Belarus blogger asks Germany 's Merkel to help release him
Mother of Belarus blogger asks Germany's Merkel to help release him

The mother of Roman Protasevich, a government critic imprisoned in Belarus, has asked German Chancellor 
Angela Merkel to help secure the release of her son and other prisoners in the country.
"We ask you very much to help us so that all innocent people are released from prison," Natalia Protasevich told the 
Bild newspaper on Saturday.
"They need urgent help because they are exposed to sadism and violence every day," she said.
She called for Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko, who has faced protests since a disputed election last 
year, to be stopped.
"Every more day, no, every more hour that passes costs innocent people, including children, their lives," she said.
Almost three weeks ago, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius 
to stop over in Minsk and detained government critic Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega who were 
on board.
The EU then reimposed sanctions against the former Soviet republic.
The blogger's father, Dmitri Protasevich, told Bild that their letters would not be delivered to their son. "Even his 
lawyer cannot talk to us freely on the phone," he said.
"Instead, two videos have already been released by the state in which forced confessions are made." In these, he 
said, one can see clear signs of torture.
One of these signs was bruises on his neck. "An expert told us that these were strangulation marks," he said.
Protasevich's parents live in exile in Poland.
Mother of Belarus blogger asks Germany 's Merkel to help release him
On Thursday, the European Parliament called for further sanctions against Belarus.

Houston: we need a mortgage. Space tourism is back on track after some early snags (crashes). Richard Branson's 
Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX are planning more launches, and Jeff Bezos has just announced he will be 
heading skyward next month on his Blue Origin programme's New Shepard rocket. The Amazon founder is due to 
go up on July 20 - or tomorrow if he subscribes to Prime. The heavens will soon be rich with plutocrats.
The opening of the space market could not be more timely because, frankly, it's getting very hard to plan a holiday 
at the moment, and suborbital flight looks likely to be on the green list. Of course, it is expensive. A ride on Virgin 
Galactic is expected to cost about $200,000-$250,000 a flight. And that's without the cost of the PCR tests you 
have to take after you land.
Two hundred grand is very much at the Ryanair end of the market, although you may not have to pay extra to get 
an allocated seat. The top bid for a seat with Bezos on New Shepard is about $2.8m. Presumably, the in-flight food 
is a lot better and the space lounge has complimentary peanuts. Last year, SpaceX teamed up with another 
company to offer a several-day stay on a space station for the bargain price of $55m. Quite a lot considering it is 
only a three-star space station and doesn't even have a pool.
On the Covid-19 point, space tourism also offers some protection against the kind of sudden travel restrictions that 
sent thousands of holidaymakers into a panic after Portugal's unexpected switch from green to amber status. Given 
that most space jaunts won't last more than a couple of hours, there is little chance of being reclassified while out of 
orbit, even if there are fears about a Neptune variant. In fact, the time you spend in zero gravity on one of these 
flights lasts a matter of minutes, which is surely not long enough even for Matt Hancock to ruin your holiday.
The plutocrats' guide to space tourism ROBERT SHRIMSLEY THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION
Perhaps this is the future of tourism. Yes, we've booked five hours in the Algarve this summer. How about you? Oh, 
a morning in Dubrovnik, how lovely.
Once we expected to be famous for 15 minutes. Now, we may dream of being somewhere else for half an hour. 
Apparently, the space trips throw in a couple of days' "training", which presumably involves swanking around an air 
base in a flying suit with the word "astronaut" sewn on to the pocket and feasting on freeze-dried breakfasts.
The eagle-eyed will have spotted that space tourism may be some way from the mass market, though. There is 
also some argument as to whether suborbital flights really count as "space" trips. But don't worry, at 90km up you 
can definitely see the curvature of your spine. Officially, it's space if you cross the Kármán line and spend at least 
10 minutes in the duty-free store at the end of the atmosphere. (At current prices, that's likely to offer some quality 
merch: watches engraved with "Mum and Dad crossed the Kármán line and all I got was this lousy Patek Philippe".)
Personally, I'm quite happy for space tourism to remain a rich person's sport. Brits in Magaluf are bad enough. Do 
we really want them in space, banging on the rocket door and singing "Two world wars and one World Cup" to all 
the passing meteors? Also, at that price, the last thing you want is to get into orbit and find other people have put 
their towels on all the loungers.
There are concerns about the environmental impact - although Branson insists the emissions are now no worse 
than a return flight from Singapore and, obviously, less frequent. Perhaps that's a small price to pay to give wealthy 
celebs the chance to tell us about the deeper feeling they gained for the planet after the ride.
While space tourism may struggle to go mass market, it might be possible to secure a simulator ride complete with 
a selfie in front of a photo of Earth from space for your social media feeds, which is obviously the primary purpose 
of the trip anyway. Many say that you see the Earth differently once you've posted it on Instagram.

Houston: we need a mortgage. Space tourism is back on track after some early snags (crashes). Richard Branson's 
Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX are planning more launches, and Jeff Bezos has just announced he will be 
heading skyward next month on his Blue Origin programme's New Shepard rocket. The Amazon founder is due to 
go up on July 20 - or tomorrow if he subscribes to Prime. The heavens will soon be rich with plutocrats.
The opening of the space market could not be more timely because, frankly, it's getting very hard to plan a holiday 
at the moment, and suborbital flight looks likely to be on the green list. Of course, it is expensive. A ride on Virgin 
Galactic is expected to cost about $200,000-$250,000 a flight. And that's without the cost of the PCR tests you 
have to take after you land.
Two hundred grand is very much at the Ryanair end of the market, although you may not have to pay extra to get 
an allocated seat. The top bid for a seat with Bezos on New Shepard is about $2.8m. Presumably, the in-flight food 
is a lot better and the space lounge has complimentary peanuts. Last year, SpaceX teamed up with another 
company to offer a several-day stay on a space station for the bargain price of $55m. Quite a lot considering it is 
only a three-star space station and doesn't even have a pool.
On the Covid-19 point, space tourism also offers some protection against the kind of sudden travel restrictions that 
sent thousands of holidaymakers into a panic after Portugal's unexpected switch from green to amber status. Given 
that most space jaunts won't last more than a couple of hours, there is little chance of being reclassified while out of 
orbit, even if there are fears about a Neptune variant. In fact, the time you spend in zero gravity on one of these 
flights lasts a matter of minutes, which is surely not long enough even for Matt Hancock to ruin your holiday.

 Exiled Belarusian politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has called for tougher sanctions on Alexander Lukashenko's 
regime. Speaking to DW, the opposition leader also talked about when she could return to Belarus.Belarusian 
opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya — currently living in exile in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius — has called 
for harsher sanctions against strongman Alexander Lukashenko's regime, adding this is the only effective way to 
put pressure on him and his administration. 
"Lukashenko only understands the language of force and economic sanctions. This is the mechanism that should 
be used ... the sanctions must be maximally tough," Tsikhanouskaya told DW in an interview Saturday while on a 
two-day visit to Berlin. 
Widening the net 
The last three rounds of sanctions the European Union imposed on Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarusian 
officials have been of a "rather moral character," she added. 
Tikhanovskaya expressed hope the next round of punitive measures will involve a greater number of law 
enforcement officials implicated in violence against pro-democracy protesters and opponents of the regime.  
'Europe's last dictator' 
At the end of 2020, Lukashenko — criticized as "Europe's last dictator" — along with his government and closest 
allies, were slapped with sanctions by the European Union following Belarus' disputed August 9, 2020, presidential 
election, and subsequent violent protests. Tikhanovskaya is widely considered by many to be the winner of the 
vote. The EU no longer recognizes Lukashenko to be the head of state. 
Currently, the 88 people sanctioned, including Lukashenko, are banned from entering the EU, and all of their 
European bank accounts have been frozen. In addition to the individuals listed, the sanctions extend to seven state 
enterprises and organizations within the country.  
Current sanctions 'not sufficent' 
Tikhanovskaya is convinced these sanctions are not sufficient, especially after it became clear, she said, that 
Lukashenko and his regime pose a threat not only to Belarusians, but to other states as well. 
Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya says 'harsh' sanctions needed
The 38-year-old was referring to an incident in May where Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane 
on its way from Athens to Vilnius to land in Minsk. Whilst in the capital, authorities ordered government critic Raman 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega to deplane. Both remain in detention.  
Following the incident, the bloc then imposed sanctions on Belarus, banning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU 
airspace. Brussels, in turn, requested EU carriers refrain from flying over Belarusian airspace.  
Appeal to EU politicians 
Tikhanovskaya used her interview on DW's "To the Point" talk show to appeal to European politicians, saying their 
policies "should not be based on what they see on TV, but on people's suffering." 
As of June 12, Belarusian human rights center Viasna reported 477 people are being held as political prisoners 
across the country. One of them, Sergey Tikhanovsky — Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's husband — a popular blogger 
who had intended on running for president, but was arrested in May 2020. He currently faces up to 15 years in 
prison on various charges — including organizing mass unrest and inciting hatred.  
Following her husband's imprisonment, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya ran as a presidential candidate. Tsikhanouskaya 
had a strong following and posed a genuine contender to win the vote. However, Lukashenko claimed victory, 
which saw massive demonstrations erupt across the country. Those protesting were violently suppressed. 
Tsikhanouskaya was forced to flee the country.  
Only new elections and a change to the country's political system, Tsikhanouskaya told DW, will allow the country 
to get out of its current political and humanitarian crisis. "Lukashenko can't stay in power," she added. 
While in Europe, Tsikhanouskaya said she got to meet "democratic politicians," politicians "who care about people's 
opinion."  
"Having seen that, I got an idea of what I'd like to have in Belarus." 
On a personal note, Tsikhanouskaya confessed she is often tired and scared. 
"But I understand I have no right to give up, because people who are in jail didn't give up. They now are suffering 
for us," Tikhanovskaya added. 
"Only these people, the families of those repressed in Belarus, have given me the energy to go on." 
Asked whether she believes she can return to Belarus, Tikhanovskaya said: "I'll go back home, as soon as my 
home is ready for me."

The UK competition regulator has launched enforcement cases into Ryanair and British Airways after the airlines 
refused to offer customers refunds for flights they were unable to take during the pandemic.
The announcement on Wednesday by the Competition and Markets Authority brought a furious response from BA, 
which said the investigation was "incredible" and any punishment could put jobs at risk.
The CMA said it was investigating whether BA and Ryanair had broken consumer protection law and had written to 
both companies detailing its concerns. The regulator opened the probe in December. Kate Beioley and Philip

 Authored by Rick Rozoff via AntiWar.com,[3]  
 So far this year, and ahead of next week's NATO summit in Belgium, the commanders of the Pentagon's Unified 
Combatant Commands and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have denounced and thundered against 
Russia and China as rivals and adversaries in every part of the world, with Iran and North Korea identified as 
second-tier threats. All four are treated as nuclear powers, real or imagined. They are the Axis of Evil of 2021, 
supplanting that of 2001.  
 In recent weeks a fifth nation has been added: Belarus. The momentum to brand it as such has been mounting 
since last August when the West supported presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya against the then-
incumbent president, Alexander Lukashenko. It reached a record level after the Belarusian government's landing of 
a Ryanair passenger plane with opposition figure Roman Protasevich on board last month.NATO has taken up the 
refrain with a vengeance[4], speaking in menacing terms not heard since the depth of the Cold War of a threat 
posed by "Minsk and Moscow"to Europeand the world. (Fifty years ago it would have been the Free World.)  
 Belarus is the only European nation (excluding microstates) except Russia that is not a NATO member or aspiring 
member, which doesn't host regular NATO- and U.S.-led war games and which has not supplied troops for NATO 
operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. In short, it's bad example that must bemade an example of.  
 On June 9 Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya spoke by telephone from the Czech Republic, where she now resides, to the 
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and urged it to promote sanctions by the U.S. and the European Union 
against her homeland, which she took the occasion of libeling as "the North Korea of Europe." By her definition 
Belarus could have been a member of the first as well as the current Axis of Evil.  
West Adds Belarus To New Axis Of Evil
 Belarusian press recentlycited Sergei Rachkov[5], chairman of the International Affairs and National Security 
Commission of the Council of the Republic of the National Assembly of Belarus, warning that the USand its 
European NATO allies are intensifying threats to his country and in doing so adding to tensions in Eastern Europe 
as a whole.  
 He said that the concerted effort by the West - one which in many ways is ominously evocative of the 
characterization of and efforts against Serbia/Yugoslavia in the late 1990s - is in large part motivated by the desire 
to wrest Belarus from its close relationship to Russia, hence eliminating the last remaining buffer between Russia 
and the thirty-nation military mega-bloc.  
 Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya: 
 - US, UK and EU must jointly act to pressure Belarus 
 - I've not yet been invited to attend G7 meeting 
 - More sanctions need to be imposed on Belarus government pic.twitter.com/hJJmUwOHrj[6]  
 — TRT World Now (@TRTWorldNow) June 4, 2021[7]  
 Perhaps Rachkov's most incisive observations are these:  
 "Of course, this is a geopolitical strategy. Before that, there was a failed scenario of a color revolution. We saw the 
attempts to disrupt the operation of enterprises, to organize strikes, and draw women and young people into 
protests. But the consolidation of our society around the head of state has put a stop to these processes, the main 
purpose of which was to try to change the behavior of Belarus, which has long been an irritant for the West that 
wants us to play by its rules, with which we conceptually disagree."  
 He added that Belarus recently has chosen, in the face of unrelenting and mounting hostility from the USand the 
European Union, to develop closer relations with China, India and the nations of Southeast Asia, Africa and the 
Middle East.  
 Referring to the likes of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya calling for punitive and onerous sanctions against their own 
country and people, the Belarusian official offered this perspective: "By the way, the very phenomenon is strange, if 
not ugly. I have been working in international relations for a long time, and I do not remember any cases when 
citizens would advocate a better life for people but in reality use methods that can lead to chaos."  
 Many people, in fact most in the world, are still living in the era of the first Axis of Evil; in their minds living in 2001. 
The world of 2021 is far more dangerous, with the very plausible threat of war in Europe that might, that almost 
certainly would, result in a military showdown between the world's two major nuclear powers.

Jun 12, 2021( Deutsche Welle Europe: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/europe/s-1433 Delivered by Newstex)  
 Exiled Belarusian politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has called for tougher sanctions on Alexander Lukashenko's 
regime. Speaking to DW, the opposition leader also talked about when she could return to Belarus.Belarusian 
opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya — currently living in exile in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius — has called 
for harsher sanctions against strongman Alexander Lukashenko's regime, adding this is the only effective way to 
put pressure on him and his administration. 
"Lukashenko only understands the language of force and economic sanctions. This is the mechanism that should 
be used ... the sanctions must be maximally tough," Tsikhanouskaya told DW in an interview Saturday while on a 
two-day visit to Berlin. 
Widening the net 
The last three rounds of sanctions the European Union imposed on Lukashenko and other high-ranking Belarusian 
officials have been of a "rather moral character," she added. 
Tikhanovskaya expressed hope the next round of punitive measures will involve a greater number of law 
enforcement officials implicated in violence against pro-democracy protesters and opponents of the regime.  
'Europe's last dictator' 
At the end of 2020, Lukashenko — criticized as "Europe's last dictator" — along with his government and closest 
allies, were slapped with sanctions by the European Union following Belarus' disputed August 9, 2020, presidential 
election, and subsequent violent protests. Tikhanovskaya is widely considered by many to be the winner of the 
vote. The EU no longer recognizes Lukashenko to be the head of state. 
Currently, the 88 people sanctioned, including Lukashenko, are banned from entering the EU, and all of their 
European bank accounts have been frozen. In addition to the individuals listed, the sanctions extend to seven state 
enterprises and organizations within the country.  
Current sanctions 'not sufficent' 
Tikhanovskaya is convinced these sanctions are not sufficient, especially after it became clear, she said, that 
Lukashenko and his regime pose a threat not only to Belarusians, but to other states as well. 
Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya says 'harsh' sanctions needed
The 38-year-old was referring to an incident in May where Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane 
on its way from Athens to Vilnius to land in Minsk. Whilst in the capital, authorities ordered government critic Raman 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega to deplane. Both remain in detention.  
Following the incident, the bloc then imposed sanctions on Belarus, banning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU 
airspace. Brussels, in turn, requested EU carriers refrain from flying over Belarusian airspace.  
Appeal to EU politicians 
Tikhanovskaya used her interview on DW's "To the Point" talk show to appeal to European politicians, saying their 
policies "should not be based on what they see on TV, but on people's suffering." 
As of June 12, Belarusian human rights center Viasna reported 477 people are being held as political prisoners 
across the country. One of them, Sergey Tikhanovsky — Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's husband — a popular blogger 
who had intended on running for president, but was arrested in May 2020. He currently faces up to 15 years in 
prison on various charges — including organizing mass unrest and inciting hatred.  
Following her husband's imprisonment, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya ran as a presidential candidate. Tsikhanouskaya 
had a strong following and posed a genuine contender to win the vote. However, Lukashenko claimed victory, 
which saw massive demonstrations erupt across the country. Those protesting were violently suppressed. 
Tsikhanouskaya was forced to flee the country.  
Only new elections and a change to the country's political system, Tsikhanouskaya told DW, will allow the country 
to get out of its current political and humanitarian crisis. "Lukashenko can't stay in power," she added. 
While in Europe, Tsikhanouskaya said she got to meet "democratic politicians," politicians "who care about people's 
opinion."  
"Having seen that, I got an idea of what I'd like to have in Belarus." 
On a personal note, Tsikhanouskaya confessed she is often tired and scared. 
"But I understand I have no right to give up, because people who are in jail didn't give up. They now are suffering 
for us," Tikhanovskaya added. 
"Only these people, the families of those repressed in Belarus, have given me the energy to go on." 
Asked whether she believes she can return to Belarus, Tikhanovskaya said: "I'll go back home, as soon as my 
home is ready for me."

Ukraine International Airlines (PS, Kyiv Boryspil) has said it will not resume flights between Kyiv Boryspil and 
Warsaw Chopin on June 18, 2021, as originally planned, due to the current crisis concerning overflights over 
Belarus and the resulting shifts in demand. The carrier said the closure of Belarus airspace to carriers from the 
European Union and Ukraine had led to "a redistribution" of the number of passengers willing to travel between Kyiv 
and Warsaw. The airline did not go into details concerning the impact of the situation. Flights between Poland and 
Ukraine do not overfly Belarus. According to the ch-aviation capacities module, there is currently an ample supply of 
scheduled capacity between Poland and Ukraine with 103 weekly return flights operated by LOT Polish Airlines, 
Wizz Air, Ryanair, and SkyUp Airlines. The capitals of the two countries are connected on a scheduled basis by 
LOT (which flies from Warsaw Chopin to both Boryspil and Kyiv Igor Sikorsky), Wizz Air (Warsaw Chopin-Kyiv 
Sikorsky), and Ryanair (Warsaw Modlin-Boryspil). UIA said it would continue to "carefully analyze the market for 
both point-to-point passengers travelling from/to Poland and transfer passengers travelling with a connection in 
Poland or Ukraine".

Protasevich in Belarus, the European Parliament has called for further sanctions on the hardline regime in Minsk.
Punitive measures should be taken against the crude oil-processing industry, the production of petroleum products, 
and the potash, steel and wood-processing industries, it said in a resolution adopted on Thursday.
In addition, cooperation with state-owned Belarusian banks should be stopped. Consideration should also be given 
to temporarily excluding Belarus from the Swift payment system.
Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign affairs commissioner, said during Tuesday's plenary debate that he hoped EU 
member states would adopt further punitive measures on Belarus at the next summit. For the first time, targeted 
economic sanctions had been agreed upon.
Almost three weeks ago, Belarusian authorities forced a Ryanair passenger plane on its way from Athens to Vilnius 
to make a stopover in Minsk and arrested the government critic Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega on 
board.
The EU then reimposed sanctions on the former Soviet republic. Since last Saturday, Belarusian airlines are no 
longer allowed to fly into EU airspace.
Due to the ongoing repression of the democracy movement in Belarus, the EU had already adopted several 
packages of sanctions targeting President Alexander Lukashenko's supporters last year.
Russia's possible role in the case should be investigated and, if necessary, sanctions imposed on those 
responsible, they said.
EU Parliament calls for further sanctions on Belarus
MEPs also backed a call by Belarusian opposition activist Svetlana Tikhanovskaya for the establishment of an 
international criminal court to hold the leadership in Minsk accountable.

 With her blood-curdling, lung-bursting screams of protest outside the European Commission office in Warsaw, 28-
year-old artist Jana Shostak has become the angry face of the Belarusian opposition movement in Poland. 
Shostak began screaming last year following the disputed re-election of Belarusian strongman Alexander 
Lukashenko, who has ruled the former Soviet republic since 1994. 
"It's a scream of spite, of anger, of powerlessness over what is happening in our country," Shostak told AFP this 
week after a minute bellowing out her howl of anguish at one of the near-daily protests outside the European 
Commission office in Warsaw.

country' Photo: AFP / Wojtek RADWANSKI  
Shostak arrived by taxi -- already rallying the protesters by shouting from the car, wearing a cotton dress in the 
white-red-white colours used by the Belarusian opposition. 
Fellow Belarusians and Polish allies have been joining the protests. Next to outdoor cafes crowded with patrons 
enjoying the end of lockdown, dozens of people have joined Shostak's screams to demand the European Union 
take more action against Lukashenko. 
"We've had enough. We want real sanctions," Shostak said. 
Their screams are now being heard far beyond Warsaw.

 The unusual form of protest has gone viral on social media, and this week Polish actor Bartosz Bielenia surprised 
the European Parliament by screaming for Belarus after receiving an award.

followed the election Photo: AFP / Wojtek RADWANSKI  
One of Shostak's screams has proved particularly popular online. 
It was on May 24 -- a day after Lukashenko diverted a Ryanair flight between two EU capitals, forced it to land in 
Belarus and arrested a dissident journalist and his girlfriend on board. 
That scream also attracted controversy in Poland because of a comment by a left-wing female parliamentarian, 
Anna Maria Zukowska, that appeared to criticise Shostak's low neckline. 
Asked about the furore, Shostak said: "I thought we were living in the 21st century and people can choose the 
gender they want, the clothes they want, express themselves the way they want.

"The fact that there was a media storm not because of the dramatic situation in Belarus but because I was not 
wearing a bra, and the fact that this came from a left-wing female politician, really took me aback," she said. 
She quickly turned the attention into a part of the protests, echoing Ukraine's high-profile Femen movement known 
for topless protests. 
She has encouraged participants to paint the logos of companies doing business in Belarus on their chests -- a way 
of campaigning for the EU to implement economic sanctions and for individual companies to "stop supporting the 
regime". 
"I like this combination of screaming and nudity a lot... It is the ultimate way to protest," said Jan Jurczyk, a 25-year-
old artist with a Rolls Royce logo on his chest. 
Shostak moved to Poland as a teenager to study art and she has previously campaigned for changing the word 
"refugee" to the word "newcomer" in Polish and for using feminatives -- feminine endings on words, including 
occupational terms. 
She travelled back to Belarus in August 2020 to vote in the presidential election and took part in some of the 
ensuing mass protests that accused Lukashenko of rigging the result.

 Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya (pictured) called on Wednesday (9 June) for an international 
tribunal to be set up to investigate what she called the 'crimes' of President Alexander Lukashenko's 'dictatorship', 
Reuters[1]. 
Lukashenko has kept a tight grip on Belarus since rising to power in 1994, and has cracked down on street protests 
that began last year over a presidential election which his opponents say was rigged so that he could retain power. 
Lukashenko, who denies electoral fraud and dismisses criticism of his human rights record, extended the 
crackdown on Tuesday by signing legislation on tougher punishment, including prison sentences, for people who 
take part in protests or insult state officials. Read more[2] 
"I call for an international tribunal to be set up which would investigate the crimes of Lukashenko's dictatorship in 
the past and during the election in 2020," Tsikhanouskaya, who is now based in Lithuania, told the Czech Senate. 
Tsikhanouskaya, who met Czech President Milos Zeman and Prime Minister Andrej Babis during her visit to the 
Czech Republic, gave no other details of her proposal. 
She said the only solution to the situation in Belarus was holding free elections with international monitors. 
Tsikhanouskaya was visiting Prague before a summit of the Group of Seven advanced economies in Britain this 
week at which Belarus is expected to be discussed.  
The former Soviet republic outraged Western countries last month by ordering a Ryanair flight to land in the capital 
Minsk and arresting a dissident journalist who was on board.

Lukashenko has dismissed Western criticism over the incident, and accused Western countries of waging a "hybrid 
war" against him. The United States and the European Union are preparing to tighten sanctions on Belarus over the 
plane incident. Read more[3]

 Airlines are seeking reform of the European Union's flight compensation rule after spending over 10 billion euros 
($12.19 billion) in passenger refunds in 2020 due to COVID-19-related travel disruptions.
Under the EU261 regulation, airlines are required to reimburse passengers for flight cancellations and delays.
The head of European air carriers Air France-KLM (AF.PA), Germany's Lufthansa (LHA.F), British Airways owner 
IAG (IAG.L), along with Ryanair (RYA.L) and EasyJet (EZJ.L) called on making the law "more realistic and more 
balanced," noting that it is incompatible with the mass groundings implemented in 2020 amid border closures and 
travel bans.
The European Commission considered revising EU261 for eight years but no change has come to fruition to date.
Air France-KLM lost over 2% on Thursday's close, Lufthansa marginally rose, while IAG fell 2%. Meanwhile, 
Ryanair declined nearly 3% and EasyJet tumbled almost 4%.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
Say it quickly: FR4978, FR4978, FR4978 
This week, the disinformation narratives regarding the forced landing of flight FR4978 were still skyrocketing. 
Some narratives were repetitive. According to pro-Kremlin media, Belarus offered the Ryanair plane to land at 
Minsk airport after abomb threat[2]. The bomb threat was alreadydebunked[3]two weeks ago, on several grounds. 
For example, the email with the purported threat was receivedafterMinsk air control reached out to the pilots and, 
painfully, for Belarus, Hamasdenied[4]sending it. 
Also, just like in the last weeks, we spotted claims that the Ryanair case shows the West'shypocrisy[5]. A similar 
complaint by pro-Kremlin media is that the West protested about the arrest of Pratasevich, but the incident is similar 
to the one withEvo Morales[6]. Unlike the Belarusian plot however, which involved fighter jets and bomb threats, the 
Bolivian president's flight was brought down bybureaucracy[7]: European nations refused it permission to enter their 
airspace. For more debunking: see thiscase[8]. 
This week brought also new theories. For example, the claim that the investigation of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization into the Ryanair flight incident wasquestionablebecause of the UN'sbias[9]. Also new: the idea that the 
Ryanair flight incident could be a provocation from theUK[10]. Among the reasons supporting this theory were a few 
remarkable ones: 1 ) FR4978 departed from Greece and Greece is in the sphere of influence of the British secret 
service, 2) The Nexta Telegram channel, which Mr Pratasevich ran, is located in Poland and the Polish secret 
services are controlled by the US secret services, which also use the UK as a satellite and 3) Ryanair is an Irish 
company. Quod eratdemonstrandum.Everything irrefutably leads to London. 
Forced Landing FR4978: Necessary, Justified And Schemed By Western Intelligence Agencies
As we pointed outlast week[11], many of these narratives remind us of disinformation campaigns following the 
poisoning and arrest of Russian opposition politicianAlexei Navalny[12], when pro-Kremlin outlets started to claim 
that this blatant act ofstate-sponsored piracy[13]was in fact aprovocationagainst Belarusand that Westernsecret 
services[14]were involved in it. 
Pro-Kremlin media apply the Navalny method to Pratasevich 
The goal of forcing the plane down was to capture Raman Pratasevich. Similar to the disinformation campaigns 
smearing opposition politician Alexei Navalny, are the outrageous claims regarding this Belarusian journalist. Just a 
few of this week's examples: 
The West is using Pratasevich as a weapon againstLukashenka[15]. Conspiracy theory. Similar to: Navalny is used 
as an instrument againstRussia[16]. Both Pratasevich and Navalny are instrumentalised. 
Pratasevich practiced shooting on unarmed Donbascivilians[17]. Smearing. Similar to: Navalny called for killing 
Chechens likecockroaches[18]. Both narratives aim to undermine the credibility of Pratasevich and Navalny and 
imply crimes they never committed. 
Lukashenka had the right to arrestPratasevich[19]. Legal magical realism. Similar to: the ECHR confirmed 
Navalny's prosecution was not politicallymotivated[20]. In both narratives, legal reasoning is conjured up out of thin 
air. 
It is The West, who else? 
If there is turbulence in the world, the pro-Kremlin media's standard response is to blame Western powers, ranging 
from institutions such as the EU and NATO to vaguer entities like the 'Global Elite[21]' or the 'Anglo-Saxons[22]'. 
For instance, one interpretation of the forced landing is that the EU is showing its imperial desires by calling for an 
overthrow inBelarus[23]. We spotted similar claims that the EU is trying to buy outBelarus[24]and the EU is a 
danger to peace and unity on the Europeancontinent[25]. 
It is not just the EU that has imperial desires. According to a claim we spotted, NATObroke agreements[26]with 
Russia and has a hostile plan against Belarus. Related to this claim is the story that approaching the Russian 
border is one of NATO's gross violations of its owncommitments[27]. In a similar fashion, another narrative claims 
that Russia is reacting toprovocative[28]behaviour from the West. 
From a cold war perspective, both nostalgic and obsolete, the driving force behind the West is still the US. 
Consistent with this perspective is the false claim we spotted that the USoverthrew[29]the legitimate government in 
Ukraine and wants to do the same for Russia, China and Hungary. Similar is the claim that theUS[30]controls 
Europe and Ukraine and does not allow Ukraine to live in peace with Russia. 
About Ukraine. According to one claim, this country is used as an instrument to fight against Russia and weaken 
theEU[31]. Somehow forgotten here was that Russia illegally annexed Crimea. Talking about instrumentalising. We 
spotted the same forgetfulness in a complaint about the jersey of the national football team of Ukraine. Their shirt is 
emblazoned with its borders, including Crimea. In the eyes of the pro-Kremlin media however, it features afascist 
slogan[32]. There can be no question that the Ukraine jersey is correct; Crimea is Ukraine and almost no one 
recognises it as Russian. Moreover, no international body recognises the so-called referendum in Crimea, 
ofteninvoked[33]by pro-Kremlin media, not theUN[34], nor theEU[35]. 
Forced Landing FR4978: Necessary, Justified And Schemed By Western Intelligence Agencies
Pro-Kremlin media are not afraid of employing contradicting narratives: It was the right thing to do! It was justified! 
The blame is on the West!

Sanctions have to hurt

Jun 11, 2021( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Can the EU topple Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus, with new sanctions? Probably not, but after the 
forced landing of Ryanair Flight 4978, further economic and financial sanctions must be inevitable. 
 Belarusian potash exports are vital when it comes to Lukashenko's ability to obtain exchangeable foreign currency, 
are likely to be targeted. Cutting the Lukashenko regime off from international banking networks like Swift is also 
being considered. 
 Regardless of the specifics of any potential sanctions, the EU should adopt tougher punitive measures against 
Lukashenko. Trying to protect him from Putin's clampdown was always make-believe 
The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) - an umbrella organization of public radio and TV decided to suspend the 
membership of Belarus TV BTRC, with EBU's board saying, 'We have been particularly alarmed by the broadcast of 
interviews apparently obtained under duress.' 
The statement was in reference to an interview on Minsk-TV with Roman Protasevich, the journalist who was 
arrested by Lukashenko's KGB after the Belarusian Air Force, on Lukashenko's personal orders, hijacked the 
Ryanair flight and forced it to land in the Belarusian capital Minsk. In the interview, Protasevich shows visible signs 
of torture. The EBU opted to block the popular Eurovision song contest in Belarus. 
The EU-Institutions should now come up with tougher sanctions for the Lukashenko regime, which is quickly 
becoming the North Korea of Eastern Europe. 
 Since the Maastricht Treaty, which also gave the EU competencies a common foreign and security policy in 1992, 
considerably more sanctions have been imposed. According to the list (www.sanctionsmap.eu[1]), more than 170 
punitive measures are currently in force against more than 30 countries. 
 Since December 2020, the EU has had a new mechanism against people worldwide for human rights violations. 
This was first used in March against China - for its repression of the Uyghurs - and other countries. Entry bans and 
account freezes have also been imposed on several people in Russia who were involved in the conviction of 
opposition figure Alexei Navalny. 
 But among diplomats, the theory has been that sanctions only work against smaller states, while large ones like 
China or Russia, the effects on their own economies are usually too great. That is why the trade sanctions that were 
imposed on China, in 1989, following the Tiananmen Square massacres did not last long. 
Sanctions have to hurt
 In the case of Belarus, international organizations like the Council of Europe and OSCE, where Belarus is a 
member, should now demand the release of regime critics and the holding of new elections under supervision. 
Airlines like Turkish Airlines or Aeroflot, both of which continue to fly to Minsk, would have to be banned from 
landing at any airport in Europe. That decision, however, could cause new problems with Ankara and Moscow. 
 The EU imposed sanctions against Russia in several stages after Moscow illegally occupied Crimea and incited a 
separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014. 
 Conversely, the Kremlin reacted by imposing import restrictions on European agricultural products. Because of 
Putin's support for Lukashenko, EU politicians like David Sassoli, the President of the European Parliament, are 
now calling for tougher measures. That said, individual countries such as Hungary and Cyprus could veto them. 
 As a result, the unanimity principle should be dropped in this case. 
 Perhaps the advice of Ukraine's ambassador to Austria, Alexander Scherba, should be followed first. In his new 
book Ukraine vs. Darkness, he suggests that punitive measures against oligarchs who support Putin's system 
should be put in place. 'Let the Russian decision-makers, propagandists, oligarchs and their families spend their 
holidays on Kamchatka or Chukotka, not in their English castles or Italian villas. Cut them off from their wealth by 
blocking them Swift and through visa revocation and freezing their accounts. Poison not only their reputations but 
their money. That's all it takes.

Upbeat Air-Cargo Demand Bodes Well for Airlines: An Analysis

Jun 11, 2021( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Even though there has been an uptick in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) in various parts of the world, the 
same lies way below the pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, demand for business travel is still very anemic. This is 
exemplified by the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) April report on air-travel demand. 
Per IATA,[1] total demand for air travel in April 2021 (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) was 
down 65.4% from the April 2019 reading. Even though the scenario pertaining to domestic demand improved in 
April from the March levels, international passenger demand continued to be lackluster with a massive 87.3% 
plunge from the Apr 2019 actuals. 
Given this scenario, passenger revenues, which account for bulk of the top line at most airlines across the globe, 
remain weak and are unlikely to recover to the pre-pandemic levels any time soon. Focus on Cargo Unit: A Saving 
Grace With passenger revenues lagging the 2019 levels, despite the recent improvement, airlines are focusing on 
their cargo units to drive the top line. The coronavirus-induced cancellation of multiple passenger flights aided the 
air-cargo markets to be in the pink of health across the globe as demand in the said space is moving northward. 
Per IATA report[2], global air-cargo demand, measured in cargo tonne-kilometers, was up 12% in April 2021 from 
the April 2019 reading and 7.8% from the March 2021 levels. The strongest performance came from the North 
American carriers. Notably, carriers from that zone contributed 7.5 percentage points to the overall 12% growth 
rate. 
The highly impressive April performance of the North American airlines is basically an extension of their upbeat 
show on this front during the March quarter. Evidently, cargo revenues surged 88.3% year over year to $497 million 
at United Airlines UAL[3] in first-quarter 2021. At American Airlines AAL[4], the same soared in excess of 100% in 
the January-March time frame. Cargo revenues increased 12% at Delta Air Lines DAL[5]. All three carriers currently 
carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6]. 
Apart from the North American carriers, airlines in other parts of the world except those in Latin America (including 
the likes of Gol Linhas GOL[7] Azul AZUL[8] and Copa Holdings CPA[9]), exhibited higher air-cargo demand for the 
month of April. For example, European carriers, that include Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[10] among others, displayed 
an 11.4% jump in cargo demand during April 2021 from the April 2019 levels. To Wrap Up With passenger 
revenues unlikely to return to the pre-pandemic levels, at least in the near future, we expect airlines to continue 
Upbeat Air-Cargo Demand Bodes Well for Airlines: An Analysis
laying an emphasis on cargo revenues to bump up their top lines. Notably, IATA expects cargo revenues to surge 
to $152 billion in 2021[11] from $128 billion in 2020 and $101 billion in 2019. 
Air-cargo demand should continue to be solid. Precisely, the gradual improvement in global economic conditions 
and supply-chain dynamics could constantly support the uptick in air-cargo demand. +1,500% Growth: One of 
2021's Most Exciting Investment Opportunities In addition to the stocks you read about above, would you like to see 
Zacks' top picks to capitalize on the Internet of Things (IoT)? It is one of the fastest-growing technologies in history,

Travel and tourism stocks may be set for an Indian summer, according to JP Morgan Cazenove, as its analysts 
found that tourists are getting ready to travel again.
A survey of travellers conducted by the US bank found that the next three to six months will still be challenging for 
the sector but suggests cause for optimism beyond that.
At the same time, research conducted by Perspectus Global claimed close to a quarter of Brits have gone against 
government advice and booked trips to 'amber list' countries. Some 40% of people polled said they need to get 
away for the sake of their mental health, and 27% said they were fully vaccinated and saw no reason not to travel.
In its own research, JPM Cazenove surveyed 1,071 individuals, 51% of which had received at least one vaccine 
dose, and some 20-26% of them plan to fly in the next three months (before the end of August). Around 38% of 
those surveyed still have significant concerns about Covid whilst travelling, though JPM notes that this marks a 
reduction from 48% back in February. The requirement to quarantine was the number one concern (given by 52% 
of respondents). Most people, however, said that their travel plans for 2022 will be similar to their behaviour back in 
2019. Moreover, the survey saw greater appetite for the resumption of business travel than the broker had 
anticipated and less enthusiasm for virtual meetings than in the February survey. JPM gave its 'top picks' in the 
travel sector with IAG, WizzAir and Whitbread among the notable inclusions. British Airways owner International 
Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:IAG) is marked with an 'overweight' rating as JP Morgan describes it as a "strong 
cost reduction story with a potential upside surprise".Wizz Air Holdings PLC (LON:WIZZ) is also seen as 
'overweight' as JP Morgan says it has the strongest multi-year growth story, plus good liquidity in its shares. Rival 
Great British take-off: IAG, WizzAir, SSP and Whitbread tipped to rise as travel ramps up in coming months
low-cost airlines easyJet Plc (LON:EZJ) and Ryanair are both rated 'neutral' as the former offers disappointing 
structural cost savings and it says the latter carries risk and onerous shareholder restrictions. Airport and railway 
station food outlet firm SSP Plc (LON:SSP) is another stock tipped by JPM with an overweight rating, with the 
analysts saying that the company is well-positioned to face prolonged travel headwinds after its rights issue, despite 
its share price weakness, and the survey is the most supportive to SSP. Premier Inn owner Whitbread PLC 
(LON:WTB) is meanwhile deemed to be more immune to travel uncertainty and a defensive business mix.

EU airlines seek to weaken passenger compensation and refund rights
EU airlines seek to weaken passenger compensation and refund rights

European airlines said on Thursday they will seek to weaken passenger compensation and refund rights in the 
wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which left the industry struggling to reimburse billions of euros in fares for 
grounded flights.
Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents the region's biggest carriers, said the so-called EU261 regulation had 
severely exacerbated the financial crisis for many airlines.
"We're looking for a more balanced approach to consumer protection," Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith 
said, adding that the European Union's passenger rights law was "one of the most punitive" in the world.
EU rules grant consumers immediate cash refunds for cancelled flights, plus compensation for those scrapped with 
less than two weeks' notice or for delays of over three hours. Multibillion-euro refund bills exacerbated the cash 
crunch for many airlines early in the pandemic.
"When events like mass cancellations get put in place this law is not flexible enough to handle such events," Smith 
said at an A4E virtual news conference, joined by the heads of easyJet, IAG, Lufthansa and Ryanair.
The European Commission indicated it was not ready to consider any weakening of passenger rights.
"We have always tried to strike the right balance between consumer protection and the protection of the tourism 
and transport industry," an EU official said. "The continued and improved protection of passenger rights is crucial to 
ensuring the necessary consumer trust in the transport sector."
The airlines also indicated that they plan to contest air traffic control fee increases agreed by EU governments last 
month to make up the effective monopoly service providers' crisis shortfall, with easyJet's CEO hinting at legal 
action.
"We are going to legally try this," said Johan Lundgren, who is the current A4E chairman. "Amazingly these 
monopoly air navigation service providers are being allowed to pass on 5.4 billion euros to airlines and to our 
customers," he said. www.reuters.com

EU court orders re-evaluation of aid for Germany 's Condor
EU court orders re-evaluation of aid for Germany's Condor

The General Court of the European Union annulled, on June 9, the European Commission's approval of EUR550 
million euro (USD670 million) worth of German state aid to Condor (DE, Frankfurt Int'l), questioning the legal basis 
of just 3% of the amount. In the ruling, the court ordered the Commission, the EU's top administrative body with 
wide competencies in the area of competition and state aid, to re-evaluate its decision from April 2020. For the time 
being, the ruling has no impact on Condor as the court explicitly said that pending a new EC decision, the 
annulment of the original approval is suspended, and the airline would not have to return any funds. The court, 
acting on a legal petition filed by Ryanair, did not question the legality of the state aid as such but rather expressed 
doubts concerning the method used to calculate the amount approved. In particular, the court said that EU law 
permitted for state aid compensating for the damages caused by extraordinary circumstances and conceded that 
the pandemic was clearly such a circumstance, as argued by the Commission. 
As such, EUR259.7 million (USD316.5 million) in aid disbursed as direct compensation for the cost of cancellations 
and the rescheduling of flights caused by border closures was not questioned by the court. However, the 
Commission also approved a further EUR17 million (USD20.7 million) to compensate Condor for the necessary 
extension of its insolvency proceedings caused by the withdrawal of Polish Aviation Group - PGL as a prospective 
investor. "The contested decision does not explain how the additional costs incurred in connection with the 
extension of Condor's insolvency proceedings were directly caused by the cancellation or rescheduling of its flights 
as a result of the travel restrictions imposed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that those costs 
were or were not foreseeable at that time does not demonstrate that they were directly caused by [the pandemic]," 
the court ruled. The judges also said the Commission had failed to explain how it had assessed the additional costs 
caused by the extension of the insolvency proceedings. It also did not provide a sufficient explanation of how LOT 
Polish Airlines parent PDL's decision, to back out of the acquisition was linked to the pandemic. The Commission 
will now have two months to draw up a new decision concerning the aid. Should it fail to meet the deadline, the 
suspension of the annulment of the original decision will be lifted, effectively forcing Condor to return the funds. For 
its part, Ryanair has welcomed the ruling. "The German government aid to Condor - both in 2019 and 2020 - went 
against the fundamental principles of EU law and has distorted the market to the detriment of consumers. Today's 
ruling is an important victory for consumers and competition," the Irish LCC said. Condor initially obtained a 
EUR380 million (USD463 million) bridge loan from the federal and state governments to help it weather the Winter 
2019/20 season as a stand-alone carrier, following the bankruptcy of its erstwhile parent Thomas Cook Group. As 
the pandemic hit Europe in March 2020, the airline could not secure a new investor or repay the loan by its own 
means. In April 2020, it received fresh aid of EUR550 million (USD670 million), which included funds to repay the 
EU court orders re-evaluation of aid for Germany 's Condor
outstanding amount of the 2019 bridge loan and EUR267.1 million (USD325.5 million) in fresh aid compensating for 
the damage suffered due to the pandemic. Last month, Condor finally secured a new investor, Attestor Capital. In 
May, the General Court issued similar rulings concerning state aid to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and TAP Air 
Portugal, also acting upon Ryanair's complaint. The judges similarly did not halt aid or order its return but mandated 
the Commission to come up with a better justification for its approval.

The UK competition regulator has launched enforcement cases into Ryanair and British Airways after the airlines 
refused to offer customers refunds for flights they were unable to take during the pandemic.
The announcement yesterday by the Competition and Markets Authority brought a furious response from BA, which 
said the investigation was "incredible" and any punishment could put jobs at risk.
The CMA said it was investigating whether BA and Ryanair had broken consumer protection law and had written to 
both companies detailing its concerns. The regulator opened the probe in December.
During the pandemic, when customers were unable to fly because of lockdowns in the UK, BA offered customers 
vouchers or the chance to rebook their flights; Ryanair only provided the option to rebook.
Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: "While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during 
the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law.
"Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely 
outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back."
The investigation is a new problem for BA and Ryanair as the airline industry faces the growing prospect of a 
second lost summer of travel.
Ryanair and BA probed over refusal to refund customers Airlines
BA, which has offered more than 3m refunds to customers during the crisis, said: "It is incredible that the 
government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees.
"Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, 
business, connectivity and the UK economy."
Ryanair said it welcomed the review and had paid customers whose flights operated during periods of lockdown "in 
justified cases".
Since June, all customers had been able to rebook flights without paying a fee, the carrier said.
Airlines were faced with a huge backlog of refunds that built up when nearly all their planes were grounded during 
the first wave of Covid-19 last spring.
More than £3bn has since been repaid to customers, according to the Civil Aviation Authority, stretching the 
industry's finances as the crisis drags into its second year.
But airlines have also been under growing scrutiny for their policies when they continued to operate flights during 
lockdowns in the UK, when non-essential travel was banned.
Airlines argue that many passengers still needed to fly because of work, and many did not offer refunds.

Jun 10, 2021( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  
 Joe Biden ordered US officials to warn Boris Johnson against endangering the Northern Ireland peace process 
during the ongoing EU trade dispute in an 'extraordinary diplomatic rebuke' before their first meeting at the G7 
today. 
According to The Times[1], Yael Lempert, America's most senior diplomat in Britain, told David Frost, the Brexit 
minister, that the UK was 'inflaming' tensions in Ireland and Europe by threatening to impose checks on ports in 
Northern Ireland. 
Lempert further cautioned Frost that she had been authorised by the president 'to take the step of issuing London 
with a demarche', the paper adds, 'a formal diplomatic reprimand seldom exchanged between allies'. Frost-y 
welcome Government minutes of the meeting between Lempert and Frost seen by The Times reveal that the US 
diplomat spoke about Biden's 'great concern' over Johnson's stance towards Northern Ireland[2], adding that 
Lempert 'slowly and gravely read her instructions [from Washington] aloud'. 
She told Frost that the issue was 'commanding the attention' of the US president[3] and that the US 'strongly urged' 
the government to come to a 'negotiated settlement' with Brussels, regardless of whether that meant 'unpopular 
compromises'. 
'Lempert said the US was increasingly concerned about the stalemate on implementing the protocol[4]', the meeting 
notes said, continuing that 'this was undermining the trust of our two main allies'.She also accused the government 
of 'inflaming the rhetoric' surrounding the trade dispute, asking the UK to 'keep it 'cool'' as negotiations over the 
impasse continue. 
A demarche is a formal communication most often sent to an adversary in order to lodge a protest at the behaviour 
of a foreign power. Often set alongside a summons for a country's ambassador, a demarche was sent by the 
Foreign Office to Belarus following the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger plane[5] in late May. 
Lempert's meeting with Frost will be the 'elephant in the room' when Johnson and Biden meet for the first time since 
the president's election at the G7 summit in Cornwall this afternoon, Politico's London Playbook[6] reports. 
The trade dispute with the EU 'is still threatening to derail proceedings in Carbis Bay over the weekend', the site 
adds. The private intervention by the president may be followed by Biden raising his concerns 'in public' during the 
summit. 
Will Joe Biden force Boris Johnson's hand in the Northern Ireland trade dispute?
Biden's 'overarching task' during his first foreign trip as president is to 'deliver the diplomatic serenity that eluded' 
US international relations[7] during the presidency of Donald Trump, The New York Times[8] (NYT) says. 
But 'the goodwill Biden brings simply by not being Trump' may be somewhat undermined by his strong stance 
against the government's actions in relation to the UK-EU trade dispute, the paper adds. Nervy first date What went 
on in the room between Lempert and Frost is not exactly clear, with CNN senior producer Luke McGee tweeting[9] 
that US diplomats are 'pushing back quite hard on the assertion that Frost was given a dressing down on the orders 
of the president'. 
But the reaction of some Conservative MPs is unlikely to defuse the tension, with one Tory Brexiteer telling Politico 
that 'America should remember who their allies are'.Asked how Johnson should respond, the MP added: 
'Unfortunately he's so senile that he probably won't remember what we tell him anyway. Unless an aide is listening 
I'm not sure he's going to remember for very long.' 
Biden has made clear that he considers the Northern Ireland protocol to be 'critical' to preserving peace on the 
island of Ireland, The Telegraph[10] reports, with his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, saying negotiations 
must continue to 'fundamentally protect the gains of the Good Friday Agreement[11] and not imperil that'. 
Sullivan declined to comment on 'whether a failure to alleviate the Northern Ireland concerns could jeopardise a 
transatlantic trade deal[12]', the paper adds, instead reiterating that 'our concern runs very deep on the Northern 
Ireland issue'. 
The Times reports that Lempert offered Frost an 'olive branch' during their face-to-face, telling him that Britain 
accepting EU rules on agricultural standards would ensure that the issue 'wouldn't negatively affect the chances of 
reaching a US-UK free trade deal'. 
But the rebuke by the White House nonetheless 'confirms that the Northern Ireland row is souring the lead-up to the 
G7 summit', the Financial Times[13](FT) says, meaning Johnson will have to negotiate 'awkward encounters'with 
European leaders in the coming days. Seaside diplomacy The prime minister maintains that Brussels'demands for 
checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland[14] and the rest of the UK are 'too onerous and are disrupting 
trade, inflaming tensions in the pro-UK unionist community', the FT continues. 
But he will also be keen to avoid the issue becoming 'a major distraction' during his meeting with Biden, the paper 
adds, during which the pair will sign a new 'Atlantic Charter' that seeks to mimic the wartime cooperation between 
Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt to deepen and confirm UK-US relations. 
Biden will have his own awkward negotiations to contend with during the three-day summit, with 'disagreements 
over trade, new restrictions on investing in and buying from China[15] and his ever-evolving stance on a natural gas 
pipeline that will route directly from Russia to Europe[16]' also on his agenda, the NYT says. 
And after four years of Trumpism, he is also set to 'face European leaders who are wary of the United States in a 
way they have not been since 1945 and are wondering where it is headed', the paper adds. 
Johnson is unlikely to have a relaxing trip to Cornwall, with 'huge pressure' expected to come his way as European 
G7 members 'press the message home' that he has to 'relent' over the trade issue, The Times reports. And after 
Lempert's intervention, 'the blunt American message' is that he 'has to find a way to make the protocol work even if 
that means painful political concessions', the paper continues. 
Having staked so much on the promise of a massive post-Brexit US free trade deal, the prime minister will have one 
eye on future transatlantic talks. And he can ill afford to create 'an impediment' to getting an agreement over the 
line, the paper adds.

 A trade body of British airlines said that businesses will require further economic support from the government if 
the COVID-19 lockdowns are not lifted during the summer, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing a letter.
Airlines UK, which includes International Consolidated Airlines' (IAG.L, IAG.MC) British Airways, EasyJet (EZJ.L), 
and Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) as members, said that the support will be necessary to "protect many tens of 
thousands of jobs" and enable the airlines to restart operations once travel restrictions are eased.
The trade body asked Finance Minister Rishi Sunak for an extension of the furlough scheme for aviation workers to 
the end of April 2022. The existing government schemes to support jobs are scheduled to end on Sept. 30.

 https://bmmagazine.co.uk/news/more-international-travel-could-screw-up-end-of-lockdown/The mass reopening of 
international travel could 'screw up' the UK's recovery from coronavirus and must be delayed until other countries 
match Britain's vaccination programme, according to the transport secretary. 
Grant Shapps said that the government had to be 'cautious' over foreign holidays because of the risk of importing 
more cases of the Indian strain of Covid-19. 
 He denied claims that the government was close to placing more countries on the green list[1], which allows 
Britons to travel abroad without quarantining on their return. 
 He said the government was 'having to wait for countries to catch up' with the vaccination programme before the 
list was expanded. In the UK, 75 per cent of adults and about 60 per cent of the population have had one dose of a 
vaccine compared with about 40 per cent of the population of many European countries such as Spain, France, 
Portugal and Greece. 
 'What no one wants to see us doing now is to screw that all up by inadvertently re-attracting the coronavirus . . . 
into this country,' Shapps told Sky News. 
 There has been criticism from airlines and tourism groups over the refusal to expand the 11-strong green list, which 
largely comprises countries that are effectively out of bounds to UK travellers. This week, Portugal was removed 
from the list even though only six out of 100,000 British tourists passing through Faro airport in the Algarve had 
tested positive for the virus. The UK also refused to add Malta to the green list even though it registered zero cases 
for the first time in almost a year this week. 
 Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, described the government's handling of foreign travel as a 'shambles' 
and insisted there was effectively 'no green list'. 
 'This stop, go, stop approach to travel is bonkers,' he told Sky News today . 'Portugal has exactly the same Covid 
case rates and higher vaccination rates when it was taken off the green list than it had when it went on it. Malta has 
higher vaccination rates than the UK. 
 'The whole thing is typical of Boris Johnson's government just making this stuff up as they go along.' 
 Forecasts drawn up by the Airport Operators Association suggested that the next three months could be 'as bad or 
worse than summer 2020' for passenger numbers. 
More international travel could screw up end of lockdown, Grant Shapps warns
 The number of destinations people from the UK could visit last summer without needing to quarantine on their 
return was 'significantly more' than under the present traffic light system, it said. The list is due to be reviewed on 
June 21. 
 The association said that UK airports lost 2.6 billion of revenue between April and September 2020, with a similar 
loss expected this year. 
 Karen Dee, its chief executive, said: 'Unless the government makes a meaningful restart of aviation possible by 
extending the green list at the next review, moving to rapid and affordable tests for returning travellers and following 
the examples of the EU and the US by reducing restrictions on fully vaccinated passengers, aviation is in for an 
extremely difficult summer.' 
 The traffic light system was announced last month, allowing people to travel to green countries without 
quarantining on their return. Up to ten days' isolation and two PCR tests are needed for amber and red countries. 
 Travel industry sources told The Times there were concerns that further changes will be delayed until mid-to-late 
July because of the risk posed to the lifting of domestic lockdown restrictions. There is already a fear that the end of 
restrictions due on June 21 will be delayed by a fortnight because of the spread of the Indian or Delta variant. 
 Speaking from Cornwall, Shapps said: 'I think most people agree that we've got to be cautious. I am the transport 
secretary, I want transport to happen, I want international transport to happen, but I think most people appreciate 
that what we need to do is open up cautiously. 
 'I hope and I am sure that will happen as more and more people are vaccinated around the world. Of course, what 
happened was that the UK got well ahead of the game in terms of more people vaccinated than any other country in 
Europe and so we are just having to wait for countries to catch up.'

British Airways and Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) face possible action from the UK competition watchdog over failing to 
offer refunds for flights cancelled due to Coronavirus (COVID-19).
The UK's two leading airlines are said to have given passengers the option of a voucher or rebooking in the case of 
BA and to rebook by Ryanair.
Both might have breached competition law by failing to offer cash refunds, according to the Competition and 
Markets Authority (CMA).
Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's chief executive, said: "While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during 
the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law.
"Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely 
outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back."
The CMA said it has written to both airlines and was seeking to resolve the issue. Possible remedies include 
refunds.
Ryanair said it had "approached such refund requests on a case by case basis and has paid refunds in justified 
cases.
"Since June 2020, all our customers have also had the ability to rebook their flights without paying a change fee 
and millions of our UK customers have availed of this option."
British Airways and Ryanair face action over COVID-19 flight refunds
The CMA has repeatedly warned the travel industry over refunds as the Coronavirus crisis unfolded.
Around 100 companies were sent an open letter in May telling them to make refund policies clear and warning them 
of their legal obligations ahead of holiday travel resuming later this year.
TUI AG (LON:TUI) was the subject of action by the CMA last September and was highlighted again last month with 
the group said to have agreed to provide clearer information on refunds 'upfront to customers'.
British Airways is owned by International Consolidated Airlines (LON:IAG).

EU court annuls approval of aid for German airline Condor
EU court annuls approval of aid for German airline Condor

BERLIN (AP) — A top European Union court on Wednesday annulled the EU's approval of 550 million euros ($670 
million) in state aid for German airline Condor, backing a challenge by budget carrier Ryanair but suspending the 
application of the ruling because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The decision by the General Court was in many ways similar to rulings last month in which it annulled EU approval 
of 3.4 billion euros in state aid for the Netherlands' KLM and a potential total of 1.2 billion euros for Portugal's TAP.
 In both of those cases, as with Condor, the application of the rulings was suspended pending new EU decisions.
The Luxembourg-based General Court said the EU's executive arm, the European Commission, had to come up 
with a more complete reasoning.
The approval of loans to vacation carrier Condor to help it get through the collapse of holiday air travel in the 
pandemic came shortly after the parent company of Polish airline LOT pulled out of a takeover bid for the former 
subsidiary of collapsed tour operator Thomas Cook.
That resulted in an extension of insolvency proceedings, from which the restructured company emerged late last 
year. Last month, Condor announced that investor Attestor Capitol would take a majority stake.
The General Court found that it was “incumbent on the Commission to examine with particular care whether the 
cancellation and rescheduling of Condor flights as a result of the travel restrictions imposed in the context of the 
pandemic were in fact the decisive cause of the additional costs incurred by Condor as a result of the extension of 
the insolvency proceedings.”
The latest ruling was another success for Irish carrier Ryanair, which also challenged the aid to KLM and TAP but 
had been stymied in other attempts to challenge such state aid to other EU airlines.
The European Commission has approved several aid plans for struggling airline companies in the wake of the 
pandemic. Ryanair also argued that the aid constituted unfair state bailouts.

 European stocks ended mixed on Wednesday, with investors focusing on the US inflation figures and the 
European Central Bank interest rate decision scheduled for Thursday. 
The French CAC ended up 0.2%, the European STOXX 600 closed up 0.1% and the Swiss Market Index finished 
up 1.1%. Meanwhile, the German DAX 30 ended down 0.4% and the FTSE 100 closed down 0.20%.
In a thin economic calendar, Germany's foreign trade surplus rose to 15.9 billion euros ($19.4 billion) in April from 
14.3 billion euros in March, the national statistical agency Destatis said. The figure fell short of the estimated 16.3 
billion-euro surplus. Meanwhile, exports grew 0.3% month over month to 111.8 billion euros, while euros fell 1.7% 
to 96.3 billion euros.
Among companies, continued strong online sales boosted Spanish fashion retailer Inditex's (ITX.MC) return to profit

Europe and South America.
Inditex, owner of fashion brands such as Zara, Pull&Bear and Stradivarius, saw its net sales grow to 4.94 billion 
euros ($6.02 billion) in the quarter ended April from 3.30 billion euros a year ago, thanks in part to a 67% surge in 
its online sales.
French auto giant Renault Group (RNO.PA) is consolidating its three industrial sites in northern France under a new 
legal entity called Renault ElectriCity, as it targets "competitive and efficient" production of electric vehicles in 
Europe.
The operations of Renault's Douai, Maubeuge and Ruitz sites will be merged under Renault ElectriCity, with an aim 
to produce 400,000 electric vehicles per year by 2025.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) is considering deferring the delivery of its B737-8-200s until after the Summer 2021 
season to avoid inducting them during the busiest time of the year, Chief Executive Eddie Wilson told Reuters. "We 
need a definitive date [from Boeing] as to when we're going to get the airplane and then we've got to decide... 
whether that suits us to take them or not because in the normal course of events we don't take aircraft in the 
summer months," Wilson said. Although Boeing certified the larger-capacity variant of the B737-8 on March 31, 
2021, the manufacturer has yet to deliver a single unit of the type to Ryanair Holdings, the larger of only two known 
customers for the variant (the other being VietJetAir) so far. 
Wilson explained that the ongoing delays had been caused by bureaucratic hurdles concerning the approval of an 
additional door to accommodate the up to 197 passengers on board. "It's really up to Boeing at Seattle to bed in 
that relationship with the FAA in dealing with issues of certification and how they have to do things differently. That's 
what it looks like," Wilson said. In late March 2021, Ryanair still expected to take sixteen B737-8-200s by the peak 
of the Summer 2021 season, although this number was already a significant downward revision from the original 
40. In mid-May, Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary admitted that the low-cost carrier was "quite upset" with the 
continuing delays and "did not necessarily believe" Boeing's assurances that the first aircraft would deliver by the 
end of May. As it turned out, O'Leary's concerns have been justified as May ended with zero deliveries. After firming 
options for 75 aircraft in December 2020, Ryanair currently has firm orders for 210 B737-8-200s. While the group 
has yet to formally unveil their initial routes or bases, the first aircraft are expected to be operated by its Ryanair UK 
and Buzz subsidiaries.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) will lodge an appeal in the European courts against the EUR3 billion euros (USD3.65 
billion) in Italian state funds allocated to ITA - Italia Trasporto Aereo (AZ, Rome Fiumicino), the government-owned 
Italian airline that is likely to replace Alitalia (AZ, Rome Fiumicino), as the Irish LCC considers it illegal state support, 
its chief executive Eddie Wilson told La Repubblica newspaper in an interview on June 5. "As soon as this money is 
injected into the newco, we will take our steps. We'll wait and see, but it is clear that this is illegal aid, and we will 
defend our interests by appealing against this latest loan," he said. "I have the impression that there is nothing 
really new, that in the end, ITA will just be an extension of Alitalia, with the usual problems already seen for 
decades, money drained from public resources to pour into a company that today, as in the past, will lose money," 
he added. 
Asked whether any of the flag carrier's assets, if put to auction, would be of interest to Ryanair, Wilson said: 
"Certainly the Milan Linate and Rome Fiumicino slots, which Alitalia, at the invitation of the European Commission, 
should leave in favour of its competitors. We are interested in that part." The low-cost carrier is closely monitoring 
developments on the issue, he continued, as "the market has changed and we are convinced that on short and 
medium-haul flights ITA will not have great opportunities to fly effectively. [...] The only chances I see for Alitalia are 
on long haul. Intercontinental flights have their own reason for existing on the Italian market if they are operated by 
Alitalia." Despite the "excellent relationship" Ryanair has with Milan Bergamo and Milan Malpensa, if the opportunity 
arose for slots at Linate, "we would not hold back," although "it is a costly airport, so we will evaluate," the chief 
executive said. Italy is a vital market for Ryanair, as "it accounts for 32% of our total business with a 28% market 
share," Wilson said. "We believe we can grow further in Italy."

 An EU court on Wednesday annulled the EU's approval of Germany's state aid to charter airline, Condor, but 
suspended the application of its ruling to give the European Commission time to come up with a new decision on 
the case. 
Condor was granted aid worth 550 million euros ($600 million) from the German government and the regional state 
of Hesse to keep it afloat during the coronavirus crisis. 
The airline was at that time already in insolvency proceedings which had to be extended because an interested 
buyer retracted its offer.

The commission however approved Germany's aid for the airline, taking into account damages suffered by Condor 
because of travel restrictions arising from the pandemic and the costs incurred in the extension of the insolvency 
proceedings. 
Following the lawsuit filed by Ryanair, the General Court of the European Union said it could not establish that the 
travel restrictions had led to the failure of Condor's sale. 
However, because of the potential "harmful consequences for the German economy" if the aid was immediately 
annulled, the court said it was suspending implementation of its ruling "pending the adoption of a new decision by 
the Commission".

       The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority or CMA Wednesday said it has launched action against airlines 
British Airways PLC, and Ryanair PLC over refunds.
 The move comes after the CMA opened an investigation whether the two British airlines have broken consumer 
law by failing to offer refunds for flights customers could not legally take.
 The CMA said it has opened enforcement cases into both firms and written to them detailing its concerns. CMA's 
investigation into the airlines sector was initiated in December 2020 following reports that consumers were being 
denied refunds for flights that they could not legally take.
 The agency noted that British Airways and Ryanair refused to give refunds to people that were lawfully unable to fly 
during periods of lockdown across the UK. Instead, British Airways offered vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair 
provided the option to rebook. Ryanair told that they repaid a small number of people having reviewed the specifics 
of their cases.
 By failing to offer people their money back, the CMA is concerned that both firms may have breached consumer 
law and left people unfairly out of pocket.
 It is now seeking to resolve these concerns with the companies, which may include seeking refunds, or other 
redress, for affected customers. Only a court can decide whether a breach has occurred.
 Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, said, "While we understand that airlines have had a tough time 
during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law. Customers booked these 
flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely outside of their control. We 
believe these people should have been offered their money back."
 British Airways and Ryanair now have the opportunity to respond to the CMA's detailed concerns.

       European stocks edged lower on Wednesday, as investors looked to upcoming U.S. inflation data and a 
European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting for directional cues.
 Amid ample chatter about rising inflation, the release of key U.S. consumer inflation data on Thursday may provide 
some cues on policy tapering.
 The European Central Bank is likely to maintain a higher pace of asset purchases for another quarter when it 
reviews monetary policy on Thursday.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 dropped 0.2 percent to 453.01, after having hit a record high of 455.66 in the 
previous session.
 The German DAX fell 0.4 percent after data showed the country's exports rose less than expected in April.
 France's CAC 40 index slipped 0.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was down half a percent.
 A sharp rise in Chinese factory prices weighed on the mining sector, with Anglo American, BHP, Rio Tinto, 
Antofagasta and Glencore falling between 1.4 percent and 2.5 percent.
 Spanish retail giant Inditex lost 1.8 percent despite reporting a turnaround to profit for the first quarter.
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S.A. declined 1.7 percent. The financial services group has reached an 
agreement with unions to lay off 2,935 employees in Spain.
 French Food group Danone gave up 1.6 percent after RBC downgraded the stock to "underperform".
 Volkswagen AG edged down slightly as the German automaker announced a contribution of $620 million or about 
500 million euros in a financing round of its Swedish battery partner Northvolt AB with a total volume of $2.75 
billion.
 Airline shares rallied after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) eased travel 
recommendations for more than 110 countries and territories.
 Lufthansa rose over 3 percent, Air France KLM climbed 3.2 percent, EasyJet rallied 2.4 percent, Ryanair Holdings 
added 2.2 percent and British Airways-owner IAG jumped 3 percent.

 Travel bosses have blasted the government over advice towould-be British holidaymakers to stay at home rather 
than heading offabroad. 
In a fresh blow to hopes of summer breaks in foreign climes[1], Environment SecretaryGeorge Eustice said 
yesterday that Britsshould 'holiday at home' in order to minimise the spread ofcoronavirus variants includingthe 
Delta[2]strain, which was first identified in India. Eustice told Sky News[3] that 'my advice to people would be 
holiday at home. We've got some great places here.' 
Travel chiefs reacted with fury to the apparent government U-turn, with one chief executive saying that the UK's 
traffic light system for foreign travel was effectively 'dead'. 
'There's no confidence in it from consumers or the travel sector and ministers are split over it,' Paul Charles, head 
of the PC Agency, told the broadcaster[4]. 
Would-be holidaymakers had been hoping that the government would broaden its so-called 'green list' of countries 
thatcitizens can visit without quarantining on return.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the Financial 
Times[5]last month that'I don't think people have a very long time to wait before other countries are able to join the 
green list'. 
But Eustice warned yesterday that 'this was not the situation' any longer, because of the spread of Covidvariants. 
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has accused ministers of 'making up' travel policy as they go along.The 
government's 'stop, go, stop, go approach to travel is bonkers', the head of Europe's largest airline told Sky 
News[6]. 
'It's typical of Boris Johnson's government, just making this stuff up as they go along. There is no green list.' 
Eustice's advice to holiday at homecomesa week after the government announced that Portugal, a popular green-
list destination, would be moved to the amber list - forcing many British holidaymakers to try to rush home in order 
to beat the quarantine deadline. 
Tim Alderslade, chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, argues thatthe UK authoritiesarebeing too risk-
averse.'What happened to the risk-based, data-led approach, which seems to have survived all of three weeks? 
These comments betray a desire to stop Brits travelling anywhere abroad,' he told The Times[7]. 
Is the UK's holiday traffic light system 'dead'?
The government's critics claimthat the UK is moving in the wrong direction at a time when some European countries 
are reopening their doorsto visitors.Spain, for example, is to allow Britons to enter the country without the need for a 
Covid test or proof of vaccination from Monday. 
'It just beggars belief,' Travel Trade Gazette editor Sophie Griffiths told the BBC[8]. 'Especially as countries are 
opening up and Britain is closing down. People are just confused and frustrated about why that's happening.'

 The UK's Competition and Markets Authority said Wednesday that it opened enforcement cases against British 
Airways and Ryanair (RYA.L) over complaints by consumers that they were refused refunds for flights when they 
were legally unable to fly due to lockdown measures.
The actions against the two airlines follow a probe launched in December 2020 over the refusals, with International 
Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG.L) British Airways allegedly offering vouchers or rebooking instead, while 
Ireland's Ryanair providing the option to rebook. The airlines have been informed of the detailed concerns and have 
the opportunity to respond.
The UK markets agency said the failure to refund the flights may be a breach of consumer law and unjustly left 
people out of pocket. The CMA wants to resolve the concerns through refunds and other forms of redress.
Ryanair's stock gained almost 1% on Tuesday's close.

 The European General Court on Wednesday ruled in favor of the appeal made by Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L, 
RY4C.IR) over a 550 million-euro ($670.7 million) aid given to charter airline Condor by the German state. 
The European Commission approved on April 26, 2020, the aid given by Germany, but the court annulled the 
decision on the ground of an inadequate statement of reasons.
Despite this ruling, the court did not request Condor to repay the funds received due to the impact of COVID-19.

 An EU court has annulled the Commission's decision to approve state aid for German airline Condor. will get to 
hold on to two loans of €550 million, for now.Budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday won an EU court case, which 
annulled the European Commission's decision to approve German state aid given to charter airline Condor.  
It is Ryanair's third legal victory contesting against billions of euros in state aid granted to its rivals to support them 
through the coronavirus crisis. 
The General Court of the EU court annulled the Commission's decisions approving two loans of €550 million ($760 
million dollars) to Condor last year. 
Condor payback delayed 
The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to be paid out, the court 
ruled. 
But the effects of the annulment — including the order to pay back the aid — are suspended until the Commission 
submits a new decision. 
Effectively, this means that the EU General Court's judges are giving the commission a chance to issue a more 
detailed decision. 
Ryanair welcomes ruling 
The budget airline hailed the court's decision as "an important victory." 
"If Europe is to emerge from this crisis with a functioning single market, the European Commission must stand up to 
national governments and stop rubberstamping discriminatory state aid to inefficient national airlines," Ryanair said 
in a statement. 
Ryanair takes on state aid recipients 
Ryanair has taken the commission to court in a slew of cases, arguing that its approving a host of state aid 
measures to airlines across Europe distorted competition in the bloc. 
It won cases related to state aid to Dutch KLM and Portuguese TAP in the first instance. But it lost others, such as a 
complaint against aid given to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair.

 Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Wednesday compared the situation in her country 
to the 1968 Soviet-led crackdown on the 'Prague Spring' democratic reform drive in the former Czechoslovakia. 
 Belarus has seen unprecedented mass protests suppressed by the police following last year's disputed presidential 
vote in which strongman Alexander Lukashenko claimed a sixth consecutive term. 
 Tikhanovskaya, who ran against him and who claims she won the vote, fled abroad after state authorities arrested 
hundreds of people taking part in mass protests and sentenced many to lengthy jail terms. 
 'Belarusians are experiencing and shaping historic events now. We see more things happening in a single day than 
we usually do in a decade,' Tikhanovskaya told the Czech senate. 
 'I think the Czech nation knows the feeling well from its history, from 1968,' Tikhanovskaya added during her 
Prague visit. 
 In August 1968, Soviet-led armies crushed a democratic movement known as the Prague Spring, which had been 
an attempt to loosen the communist influence wielded by Moscow. 
 Tikhanovskaya, who now lives in Lithuania, also drew a link between 1968 and the recent forced landing of a 
Ryanair plane in Minsk and the subsequent arrest of Belarusian journalist and activist Roman Protasevich. 
 'A document drafted by the Soviet government claimed that Czech leaders had themselves invited Warsaw Pact 
soldiers to enter Czechoslovakia,' said Tikhanovskaya. 
 'Lukashenko's regime is saying today the Ryanair pilot himself demanded a landing in Minsk.' 
 She also mentioned Prague-born writer Franz Kafka, known for his surrealist novels. 
 'Belarusians bitterly joke that if Kafka lived in our times, he would stop writing because he could not come up with 
anything more absurd than Belarusian courts,' she said. 
 'When laws cease to work in a country, you may get imprisoned for a month and a half for the colour of your 
trousers or nails, and solidarity may become a crime.' 
 Also in Prague, Tikhanovskaya met with the Czech president and prime minister as well as exiled Belarusians.

Budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday won an EU court case against German state aid given to its competitor 
Condor.
The General Court of the EU court annulled the European Commission's decisions approving coronavirus-related 
state aid to Condor: the airline was granted two loans of 550 million euros (760 million dollars) last year.
The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to be paid out, the court 
ruled on Wednesday.
However, the effects of the annulment - including the order to pay back the aid - are suspended until the 
commission submits a new decision.
Effectively, this means that the EU General Court's judges are giving the commission a chance to issue a more 
detailed decision. It therefore annulled the commission's decision.
Ryanair has taken the commission to court in a slew of cases, arguing that its approving a host of state aid 
measures to airlines across Europe distorted competition in the bloc.
While it won certain cases in first instance, for example related to state aid to Dutch KLM and Portuguese TAP, it 
lost others, such as a complaint against aid given to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair.

fastest annual pace in over 12 years in May on the back of surging commodity prices.
 Investors await the release of U.S. inflation data on Thursday that could offer clues on the Federal Reserve's 
stance on tapering monetary stimulus.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 dropped 47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,048 after rising 0.3 percent on Tuesday.
 A sharp rise in Chinese factory prices weighed on the mining sector, with Anglo American, BHP, Rio Tinto,

 Rolls-Royce Holdings shares rose half a percent. The aerospace company said that it has appointed Anita Frew as 
a Non-Executive Director and Chair Designate.
 Airline EasyJet rallied 2.4 percent, Ryanair Holdings added 2.2 percent and British Airways-owner IAG jumped 3

European Union court on Wednesday annulled the EU's approval of 550 million euros in state aid for German 
airline Condor, backing a challenge by budget carrier Ryanair but suspending the immediate application of the 
ruling because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. (AP Photo/Michael Probst) 
BERLIN (AP) — A top European Union court on Wednesday annulled the EU's approval of 550 million euros ($670 
million) in state aid for German airline Condor, backing a challenge by budget carrier Ryanair but suspending the 
application of the ruling because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 The decision by the General Court was in many ways similar to rulings last month in which it annulled EU approval 
of 3.4 billion euros in state aid for the Netherlands' KLM and a potential total of 1.2 billion euros for Portugal's TAP. 
 In both of those cases, as with Condor, the application of the rulings was suspended pending new EU decisions. 
 The Luxembourg-based General Court said the EU's executive arm, the European Commission, had to come up 
with a more complete reasoning. 
 The approval of loans to vacation carrier Condor to help it get through the collapse of holiday air travel in the 
pandemic came shortly after the parent company of Polish airline LOT pulled out of a takeover bid for the former 
subsidiary of collapsed tour operator Thomas Cook.  
 That resulted in an extension of insolvency proceedings, from which the restructured company emerged late last 
year. Last month, Condor announced that investor Attestor Capitol would take a majority stake. 
 The General Court found that it was 'incumbent on the Commission to examine with particular care whether the 
cancellation and rescheduling of Condor flights as a result of the travel restrictions imposed in the context of the 
pandemic were in fact the decisive cause of the additional costs incurred by Condor as a result of the extension of 
the insolvency proceedings.' 
 The latest ruling was another success for Irish carrier Ryanair, which also challenged the aid to KLM and TAP but 
had been stymied in other attempts to challenge such state aid to other EU airlines.  
 The European Commission has approved several aid plans for struggling airline companies in the wake of the 
pandemic. Ryanair also argued that the aid constituted unfair state bailouts. (Ad) The Electric Vehicle boom is here!

7 Semiconductor Stocks Set to Gain From the Chip Shortage[2] Who knew that something so tiny could create such 
a big problem? However, that's the case with the semiconductor industry. Chip manufacturers are facing supply 
chain disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Semiconductors are in high demand for the big tech companies who need the chips to power the servers for their 
data centers. But they are also needed for much of the technology we take for granted including laptops, tablets, 
mobile phones, gaming consoles, and automobiles - a sector that seems to be at the root of the current crisis. 
 Any weekend mechanic knows that even traditional internal combustion cars are heavily reliant on electronics. In 
fact, electronic parts and components account for 40% of a new, internal combustion vehicle. That's more than 
doubled since 2000. 
 However as it turns out, some manufacturers may have overestimated how soon consumers would be ready for an 
'all-electric' future. And that meant that they didn't forecast how much demand there would be for the kind of chips 
needed to do the mundane, but vital tasks of steering, braking, and even powering windows up and down. 
 Part of the problem is that U.S. businesses are heavily reliant on countries like China and Taiwan for their 
semiconductors. In fact, only about 12.5% of semiconductor manufacturing is done in the United States. 
 Of course, this creates a tremendous opportunity for the companies that manufacture these chips. And it comes at 
a good time. The semiconductor sector is notoriously cyclical and was coming down from the elevated demand for 
the 5G buildout. 
 In this special presentation, we'll give you a list of seven semiconductor companies that you can invest in to take 
advantage of this opportunity.

British Airways and Ryanair investigated for not offering Covid refunds

of 
Britain's biggest airlines may have breached consumer law by failing to offer timely refunds for flights cancelled 
because of the pandemic, the competition watchdog said today. 
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that British Airways and Ryanair were under investigation 
because they 'refused to give refunds to people that were lawfully unable to fly'. 
 Both airlines may have left passengers 'unfairly out of pocket', it said, with some travellers forced to accept 
vouchers for future flights instead of getting their money back. 
 The regulator could take the carriers to court under the Enterprise Act 2002 to seek refunds or compensation for 
affected customers. 
 The move is made after repeated criticism of airlines for failing to provide money back for flights cancelled as a 
result of travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic over the past 16 months. 
 Under existing rules, airlines are supposed to provide a cash refund if requested within seven days. 
 In some cases, airlines and tour operators have asked customers to accept vouchers or credit notes for future 
bookings, even though there is no indication of when flights and holidays outside the UK will fully resume. 
Passengers who did get their money back often told of lengthy delays or being forced to spend hours on the 
telephone attempting to chase refunds via a call centre. 
 Today's move comes after the watchdog launched enforcement action against several package holiday 
companies, forcing them to agree to offer cash refunds to customers. 
 Last month, Teletext Holidays and Alpharooms agreed to hand back 7 million to customers whose holidays were 
cancelled as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 It follows similar agreements made by LoveHolidays, Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays and TUI UK after thousands 
of customers complained that the companies had failed to refund them for cancelled trips. 
 The travel sector has been one of the hardest hit during the pandemic and has faced the most scrutiny from the 
watchdog, which wrote to more than 100 companies reminding them of their responsibility to process all refunds 
within the legal timeframe. 
 Today, BA hit out at the action, accusing the government of attempting to 'punish further an industry that is on its 
knees'. It said it had issued more than three million refunds. 
British Airways and Ryanair investigated for not offering Covid refunds
 However, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, insisted that airlines had a duty to ensure passengers could book 
tickets with 'confidence'. 
 He told Sky News: 'There is an absolute requirement and duty to make sure that people either rebook or get their 
money back; that is the way to build confidence . . . I do urge all operators to adhere to that and welcome the 
Competition and Market Authority work into this because that's how we are going to rebuild confidence.' 
 The watchdog said it would be writing to both airlines as part of the investigation. 
 It said that during the lockdown 'British Airways and Ryanair refused to give refunds to people that were lawfully 
unable to fly, with British Airways offering vouchers or rebooking and Ryanair providing the option to rebook[1]'. 
Irish-based Ryanair operates an extensive short-haul European network out of UK airports while BA operates short 
and long-haul routes. 
 It added: 'The CMA is concerned that, by failing to offer people their money back, both companies may have 
breached consumer law and left people unfairly out of pocket. 
 'It is now seeking to resolve these concerns with the companies, which may include seeking refunds, or other 
redress, for affected customers.' 
 Andrea Coscelli, the regulator's chief executive, said: 'While we understand that airlines have had a tough time 
during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law. 
 'Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely 
outside of their control. We believe these people should have been offered their money back.' 
 The agency said that it should not be assumed either airline has broken the law. 
 A spokeswoman for BA said: 'We continue to offer highly flexible booking policies at the same time as operating a 
vastly reduced schedule due to government-imposed travel restrictions, and we have acted lawfully at all times. 
 'It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees, after prohibiting 
airlines from meaningful flying for well over a year now. 
 'Any action taken against our industry will only serve to destabilise it, with potential consequences for jobs, 
business, connectivity and the UK economy.' 
 Ryanair said it had looked at refunds on a case-by-case basis and had paid money back 'in justified cases'. 
 'Since June 2020, all our customers have also had the ability to rebook their flights without paying a change fee 
and millions of our UK customers have availed of this option,' it said in a statement.

 An EU court has annulled the Commission's decision to approve state aid for German airline Condor. will get to 
hold on to two loans of €550 million, for now.Budget airline Ryanair on Wednesday won an EU court case, which 
annulled the European Commission's decision to approve German state aid given to charter airline Condor.  
It is Ryanair's third legal victory contesting against billions of euros in state aid granted to its rivals to support them 
through the coronavirus crisis. 
The General Court of the EU court annulled the Commission's decisions approving two loans of €550 million ($760 
million dollars) to Condor last year. 
Condor payback delayed 
The EU's competition watchdog had not given enough reasons why it allowed the money to be paid out, the court 
ruled. 
But the effects of the annulment — including the order to pay back the aid — are suspended until the Commission 
submits a new decision. 
Effectively, this means that the EU General Court's judges are giving the commission a chance to issue a more 
detailed decision. 
Ryanair welcomes ruling 
The budget airline hailed the court's decision as "an important victory." 
"If Europe is to emerge from this crisis with a functioning single market, the European Commission must stand up to 
national governments and stop rubberstamping discriminatory state aid to inefficient national airlines," Ryanair said 
in a statement. 
Ryanair takes on state aid recipients 
Ryanair has taken the commission to court in a slew of cases, arguing that its approving a host of state aid 
measures to airlines across Europe distorted competition in the bloc. 
It won cases related to state aid to Dutch KLM and Portuguese TAP in the first instance. But it lost others, such as a 
complaint against aid given to Scandinavian SAS and Finnair.

Lithuania 's president warns of threat posed by neighbouring Belarus

Lithuania's defences need to be bolstered in light of the rising threat posed by neighbouring Belarus, President 
Gitanas Nauseda said on Tuesday, less than a week before a NATO summit.
"Beyond Lithuania's eastern borders there is an unstable space where inherent human rights and the rules of the 
free world are disrespected, where dictators ... step into the role of terrorists and hijack passenger planes. Where 
border and nuclear security becomes a tool of blackmail," said the EU and NATO country's leader.
Belarus' long-time leader, Alexander Lukashenko, re-inflammed tensions with the EU last month after a Ryanair 
passenger flight from Athens to Vilnius was forced to land in Minsk and an opposition journalist and his partner 
were taken into custody. Leaders in the West had described it as a "state hijacking."
It's been nearly a year since Belarus hit the headlines following presidential elections in August that spurred 
protests against Lukashenko, who claimed victory. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, whom the opposition claims as the 
true winner, is in exile in Lithuania.
Lukashenko's latest threat is to allow migrants to move through his country on their way to the EU. Lithuania has a 
nearly 680-kilometre border with Belarus, which is part of the EU's external border.
The government in Vilnius reported a sharp increase in illegal border crossings by migrants the previous week. 
Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite suspected a targeted action by the leadership in Minsk.
A controversial Belarusian nuclear power plant only about 50 kilometres from the Lithuanian capital also weighs on 
relations.

The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, in a break with usual diplomatic practice, called Belarusian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko "a dictator" in the European Parliament on Tuesday.
"I agree with all of you, we are facing a dictator," Borrell told parliamentarians during a plenary debate in 
Strasbourg. He also stressed the need to continue exerting pressure on Lukashenko.
The European Union has adopted several sanctions packages against Lukashenko and his supporters, most 
recently over the forced landing in Minsk of a Ryanair passenger flight between Athens and Vilnius and subsequent 
arrest of a dissident journalist and his partner.
Belarusian airlines have in response not been allowed to fly into European Union airspace since the weekend.
The Minsk government's attempts to suppress ongoing protests in the former Soviet republic had earlier led the 
bloc to sanctions.
Less than a week before a NATO summit, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Tuesday his country's 
defences need to be bolstered in light of the rising threat posed by neighbouring Belarus.
"Beyond Lithuania's eastern borders there is an unstable space where inherent human rights and the rules of the 
free world are disrespected, where dictators ... step into the role of terrorists and hijack passenger planes. Where 
border and nuclear security becomes a tool of blackmail," said the EU and NATO country's leader.
It's been nearly a year since Belarus hit the headlines following presidential elections in August that spurred 
protests against Lukashenko, who claimed victory. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, whom the opposition claims as the 
true winner, is in exile in Lithuania.
EU's top diplomat Borrell calls Belarus ' Lukashenko 'dictator'
Lukashenko's latest threat is to allow migrants to move through his country on their way to the EU. Lithuania has a 
nearly 680-kilometre border with Belarus, which is part of the EU's external border.
The government in Vilnius reported a sharp increase in illegal border crossings by migrants the previous week. 
Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite suspected a targeted action by the leadership in Minsk.
A controversial Belarusian nuclear power plant only about 50 kilometres from the Lithuanian capital also weighs on 
relations.

Jun 08, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 President Joe Biden's meeting with leaders of the G7 leading industrial economies in an English seaside village 
this week will usher in a new focus on rallying US allies against common adversaries - the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Russia and China, Reuters[1]. 
New COVID-19 variants and rising death tolls in some countries will loom large during the gathering from Friday to 
Sunday (11-13 June), alongside climate change, strengthening global supply chains and ensuring the West 
maintains its technological edge over China, the world's second-largest economy. 
Biden, a Democrat, vowed to rebuild relations with allies after four rocky years under former President Donald 
Trump, who pulled Washington out of several multilateral institutions and threatened at one point to quit NATO. 
"In this moment of global uncertainty, as the world still grapples with a once-in-a-century pandemic, this trip is about 
realizing America's renewed commitment to our allies and partners," Biden wrote in an opinion piece published by 
the Washington Post on Saturday. 
The gathering will put Biden's "America is back" motto to the test, with allies disillusioned during the Trump years 
looking for tangible, lasting action. 
It is a pivotal moment for the United States and the world, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on CNN 
on Sunday. 
"Is international cooperation going to be restored or are we still in this world where nationalism, protectionism and to 
some extent isolationism are dominating?" Brown asked. 
Russia will be at the forefront of attention at the G7 summit in Cornwall, England, and the days afterward when 
Biden meets with European leaders and NATO allies in Brussels, before heading to Geneva to meet Russian 
President Vladimir Putin. 
Biden G7 and NATO to-do list: Unite allies, fight autocracy, attack COVID-19
The recent ransomware attack[2] on JBS (JBSS3.SA)[3], the world's largest meatpacker, by a criminal group likely 
based in Russia, and Putin's financial backing for Belarus after it forced a Ryanair (RYA.I)[4] flight to land so it could 
arrest a dissident journalist on board, are pushing U.S. officials to consider sharper action. 
On the sidelines of the NATO summit, Biden is also expected to meet with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a 
crucial session between the sparring NATO allies after Ankara's purchase of Russian defense systems angered 
Washington and risked driving a wedge within the alliance. 
G7 finance ministers reached a landmark global deal[5] on Saturday (5 June to set a minimum global corporate tax 
rate of at least 15%, potentially hitting giant tech companies like Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O)[6] Google, Facebook 
Inc (FB.O)[7] and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN.O)[8] Biden and his counterparts will give the deal their final blessing in 
Cornwall. The Biden administration, which on Thursday (3 June) detailed its plans to donate 80 million doses of 
COVID-19 vaccines[9] globally by the end of June, is leaning heavily on allies to follow suit as the global pandemic 
death toll approaches 4 million, US and diplomatic sources say. 
Washington reversed course last month and backed negotiations over waivers for intellectual property protections 
at the World Trade Organization to speed vaccine production in developing countries, much to the chagrin of 
Germany and Britain. 
European diplomats say they see little common ground on the issue, and argue that any WTO compromise would 
take months to finalize and implement. That may prove a moot point if sufficient vaccine doses are shared with 
developing countries to slow - and eventually halt - the pandemic. 
Biden announced plans in May to require U.S. government contractors and financial institutions to be more 
transparent about the climate change risks faced by their investments, and administration officials are pushing other 
countries to adopt similar plans. 
The UK also wants governments to require businesses to report such risks as a way to boost investment in green 
projects. But agreement on a way forward is unlikely to come in June. A deal could emerge at a U.N. climate 
summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in November. 
G7 countries also have different views on carbon pricing, which the International Monetary Fund views as a key 
way to curb carbon dioxide emissions and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. 
The Biden administration will urge allies to unite against China[10] over allegations of forced labor in Xinjiang 
province, home to the Muslim Uighur minority, even as it seeks to maintain Beijing as an ally in the climate change 
fight. 
Sources following the discussions say they expect G7 leaders to adopt strong language on the forced labor issue. 
China denies all accusations of abuse in Xinjiang.

 June 8, 2021, 1:24 PM  
 On Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden will head to Europe in his first overseas trip since taking office. After a 
flurry of high-level meetings with G-7 and NATO members and the leadership of the European Union, during which 
Biden is expected to rally democratic allies, he will conclude his trip by meeting with his Russian counterpart, 
Vladimir Putin, in Geneva, Switzerland. 
 The much-anticipated summit comes as relations between Washington and Moscow have reached their lowest ebb 
since the Cold War. In what is sure to be a contentious meeting, the two leaders will have no shortage of topics to 
discuss, including recent cyberattacks, arms control, the conflict in Syria, and Russia's recent military buildup near 
the border with Ukraine. 
 Ahead of Biden's trip to Europe, Foreign Policy spoke with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, chair of the U.S. Senate Foreign 
Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation, who returned last week from a bipartisan 
congressional delegation visit to Lithuania, Georgia, and Ukraine. This interview has been lightly edited for length 
and clarity. 
 Foreign Policy: What were your hopes for this trip? Were you looking to send a particular message to U.S. allies in 
the region? 
 Sen. Jeanne Shaheen: Yes. We originally had started off planning to go to Ukraine and Georgia. You know some 
of the challenges that they've had in Georgia with the disagreement between the ruling party and the main 
opposition party. And of course, Ukraine, because of the concerns about the ongoing fighting and the impact from 
Nord Stream 2 from the upcoming NATO summit, we thought it was very important to go there and make sure they 
understood how important we think they are as an ally, and that the progress that they have made we hope will 
continue. We wanted to reassure them that we support their efforts in reform of the judicial system and other 
aspects that have been challenging because of corruption in the country. And then we had the trip planned, and 
[Belarusian President Aleksandr] Lukashenko brought down the Ryanair jet. We thought based on that, it would be 
important to meet with the opposition leader in Lithuania as we were headed to Eastern Europe. 
 FP: When you were in Ukraine, what was the mood like among Ukrainian officials that you met with? 
 JS: Well, they were very concerned. They were concerned about what will happen with Nord Stream and what the 
impact would be on Ukraine. They were concerned about what was happening in Belarus. They were concerned 
Sen. Shaheen: Ukrainian Officials Are 'Anxious'
about the upcoming NATO summit and future opportunities that they might have with NATO. They have fought with 
us in a number of the NATO missions, and they are very interested in the security, the allies that working with 
NATO would provide. So I think it's fair to say that they were anxious. That's why I was pleased to hear that 
President Biden talked to [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelensky this afternoon. 
 FP: In an interview published by Axios, Zelensky said he was willing to meet Biden at 'any spot on the planet' 
ahead of his meeting with Putin. Do you think it was appropriate for Biden to meet with Putin before meeting 
Zelensky? 
 JS: Well, I think that's why the president called President Zelensky and why he invited him to the White House this 
summer. 
 FP: But that meeting will be after. I mean, the timing of meeting the Russian leader before the Ukrainian leader. 
 JS: No, I'm less concerned about the timing than I am about making sure that the meeting happens, that the 
president is speaking with Ukraine, that there is support for Ukraine's aspirations, and that those lines of 
communication are open. 
 FP: National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said at a press briefing on Monday that the administration isn't looking 
to the upcoming summit with Putin in terms of deliverables, but it's about tending this desire for a stable and 
predictable relationship. But do you have any objectives? What would you like to see come out of this meeting in 
Geneva? 
 JS: Well, I would like to have President Biden be very clear with Vladimir Putin about what we think is acceptable 
when it comes to cyber hacking the United States and other democracies, when it comes to his aggressive 
intentions in Eastern Europe. One of the things that we did when we were in Georgia was go up to the 
administrative boundary line of South Ossetia and we met with the EU monitoring mission. We saw through 
binoculars the fencing that's been put up, the effort to expand the footprint by Russia in South Ossetia. We heard 
from the EU mission that they are not allowed to patrol on the other side of the boundary line with South Ossetia 
even though that was part of the agreement that ended the conflict in Georgia. 
 So I think there are very real concerns about what Russia is doing, and the president should be letting them know 
that: that we think it's unacceptable that they are still occupying Crimea and that they are still in open conflict in the 
Donbas in Ukraine and that they have soldiers stationed there. In South Ossetia, they estimated there are 
thousands, several thousand soldiers in the province. And we saw what happened earlier in the spring with the 
Russian buildup along Ukraine's eastern front. They claim to have withdrawn the troops, but what we heard when 
we were there was that the equipment is all there. There are still tens of thousands of troops along that border, and 
that's not acceptable. We don't know exactly what he [Putin] did with Lukashenko, but it's pretty clear that he was 
supportive of the hijacking of the Ryanair jet by Lukashenko. And so we need to be clear with him that these are not 
actions that are acceptable to free countries, to democracies, to Western Europe and the rest of the world. 
 FP: Commentators have often spoken about Putin's desire to be seen as a grand player on the world stage. Do 
you have any concerns that a meeting with the U.S. president so early in his presidency will be spun at home as a 
win for the Russian president? 
 JS: Listen, he's going to do that no matter when they meet. It doesn't matter what the truth is. We've already seen 
that it doesn't matter to Putin what the truth is. And I think it's important for our president to be clear, after four years 
when it wasn't clear from the Trump administration, about what's acceptable and what isn't. 
 FP: And I want to speak about Belarus a little bit because I know you met with [opposition leader Svetlana] 
Tikhanovskaya's team when you were in Lithuania. What options do you think Western countries, the United States 
and Europe, have to respond to Lukashenko's brutal crackdown, all the jailings and torture, especially given that 
this is a regime that has already weathered many, many years of sanctions? 
 JS: Well, it has, but one of the first things we have the ability to do is speak out with the international community. 
And one reason we were there, one reason we wanted to meet with Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was to let her know 
that we are supportive of what she's doing, that we're concerned about what's happening with the opposition in 
Belarus. That we appreciate her courage, her willingness to leave her husband in prison to flee to Lithuania so she 
can operate and try and build support in Europe. And while she's traveling around having meetings with folks trying 
to raise concerns about what's happening in Belarus, what we saw from Putin and Lukashenko was their travel on 
Putin's yacht while Lukashenko's putting people in jail and torturing them. I mean, the juxtaposition of that can't be 
lost on the free world. 
 So speaking out is one of the things we can do. We're having a hearing this week in the Foreign Relations 
Committee where she [Tikhanovskaya] will appear virtually, and we have the ambassador to Belarus and other 
Sen. Shaheen: Ukrainian Officials Are 'Anxious'
experts who are going to appear. So trying to shine a light for the international community on what's happening 
there, I think, is very important. Unified sanctions, so it's not just the United States, but it's the EU and the United 
States and other countries that are concerned about what's happening there, and continuing to raise the issue at 
every opportunity. 
 FP: You've co-sponsored a bill that would provide additional support for victims of Havana Syndrome. Do you feel 
like affected officials and military personnel are getting enough support currently? I mean, I've spoken to people 
who say they've really had to bang on doors to get referred to Walter Reed [National Military Medical Center] for 
treatment. 
 JS: Yeah. Sadly, I have spoken to some of those folks as well. I think the administration is taking this issue 
seriously. I think they are beginning to coordinate efforts. I would like to see more done. I would like to see us 
ensure that everybody who's affected gets the same level of treatment. I think we're moving in that direction, but 
there are still some questions that I have about whether everyone is able to go to Walter Reed, for example, and 
get treatment. And one of the things we know, or at least what we've heard from scientists, is the sooner people can 
get treatment, the better for their future prognosis. So ensuring that personnel, State Department, [Defense 
Department], our intelligence agencies understand this is a potential threat and what to do if it happens to them, I 
think, is really important. And again, this is where a coordinated effort at the highest levels is really important.

Airlines have laid on extra flights in Portugal to help British holidaymakers return before the new quarantine 
deadline comes in overnight.
EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) said last week it was putting on larger planes to bring UK holidaymakers back and said 
today passengers would be able to charge fights without fees.
British Airways, owned by IAG PLC (LON:IAG) also said they could change fight free of charge by booking through 
the airline's website.
People visiting Portugal have until 4am tomorrow morning to get back to the UK to avoid spending ten days in self-
isolation and taking Covid-19 tests on days two and eight.
Pictures from Portugal have shown long queues of British holidaymakers trying to get flights, pre-flight Covid-19 
tests and also to board.
Reports said Faro on the Algarve had an additional 40 flights laid on with 7,000 passengers expected to leave today 
or more than double the average.
Portugal's status on the government's traffic light system was changed from green to amber on Thursday last week 
sparking an angry response from the airline industry.
"What we don't understand is why the UK, which has been so successful with vaccines, is expecting its vaccinated 
citizens travelling to Portugal coming back to quarantine,"  Ryanair chief executive Micheal O'Leary said.
Portugal gets extra flights as Brits rush home to beat quarantine deadline
The change of stance on Portugal was sparked by a rise in cases of the so-called Delta or Indian variant of Covid-
19 and there were fears today that rising infections in the UK might prompt the government to delay its reopening 
plans.
The current roadmap should see all restrictions lifted in England on 21 June, but a growing number of scientists are 
calling for at least a few weeks delay to see how the threat of the Indian variant develops.
Health secretary Matt Hancock is to give an update to the House of Commons at 3.30pm.

Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya was introduced by the head of the Czech Senate as 
the "elected president of Belarus" during a visit to Prague on Monday.
In his remarks, Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil denounced Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko for 
refusing to give up power following August's presidential election, which was slammed by the European Union, the 
United States and others as marred by fraud, repression and state violence.
The elections in the authoritarian country were "unfree, unfair, unjust and illegitimate," Vystrcil said.
The opposition believes Tikhanovskaya, 38, was the true winner in August, which prompted them to organize 
months of mass protests that were met by a fierce police crackdown and widespread arrests. Tikhanovskaya fled to 
neighbouring Lithuania.
Tikhanovskaya thanked the Czech Republic for its support in, among other things, providing medical treatment to 
supporters of the Belarusian opposition.
Tikhanovskaya once again condemned the arrest of activist journalist Roman Protasevich, whose Ryanair plane 
was forced to land in Minsk two weeks ago so that he could be taken into custody along with girlfriend, Sofia 
Sapega.
The incident threw the plight of the Belarus' opposition back into the spotlight.
No one can still be in doubt that the Belarusian leadership are "terrorists" and must be ousted, Tikhanovskaya said. 
A new wave of protests was being prepared, she added.
Her agenda also includes meetings with Prime Minister Andrej Babis, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhanek and 
President Milos Zeman.

Tikhanovskaya has been trying to get EU states to put greater pressure on Lukashenko to enter into a dialogue with 
the opposition so that a democratic political transition can take place.

BRA - Braathens Regional Airlines (TF, Stockholm Bromma) has announced it will relaunch scheduled international 
flights towards the end of the summer season, connecting Aarhus in Denmark with destinations in Sweden. The 
Swedish regional carrier will operate from Stockholm Bromma via Gothenburg Landvetter to Denmark's second-
largest city 6x weekly starting on September 27. Flights from Sälen, an airport opened in late 2019 to serve the 
nearby ski resorts of Sälen and Idre in Sweden, and Trysil in Norway, are scheduled to begin on December 19, 
2021, and will operate 2x weekly. All flights to Aarhus will be operated with ATR72-600 turboprops by BRA's 
technical subsidiary BRA - Braathens Regional Airways. 
"We see it as the perfect time to launch BRA in Denmark as our first international market here at the back of the 
pandemic. Aarhus Airport is a really good match for BRA with an attractive guest potential in the Aarhus region and 
Jutland, and we look forward to making a strong effort to link the Nordic region closer together," owner Per G 
Braathen said. BRA had a rough 2020 due to the pandemic, which forced it to suspend all operations on April 6, 
2020, and subsequently, file for bankruptcy protection. The crisis jeopardised its planned expansion of European 
operations, which had been due to begin on March 30, 2020. The carrier planned to gradually add new international 
routes over the Summer 2020 season in addition to its Växjö-Berlin Tegel route, which operated from summer 
2018. It relaunched limited charter operations on October 1, 2020, and then resumed scheduled domestic 
operations later in the final quarter of 2020. It currently connects its Bromma base with Gothenburg, Malmö, Visby, 
Angelholm/Helsingborg, and Umeå with more domestic routes due to restart throughout the Summer 2021 season. 
The carrier's fleet comprises twelve ATR72-600s. Currently, Aarhus's only international services, to Berlin 
Brandenburg Int'l, are operated by easyJet Europe, the ch-aviation schedules module shows. However, Ryanair 
and Air Dolomiti are scheduled to start flights to the Danish airport later this summer. Per G Braathen is the brother 
of Erik Braathen, another industry veteran who is backing Norwegian low-cost carrier start-up, Flyr.

European Council President Charles Michel accused Moscow of "illegal, provocative and disruptive activities 
against the European Union, its member states and others" in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin 
on Monday.
"EU-Russia relations are at a low," an EU press release outlining Michel's message to Putin stated. "This situation 
or its further deterioration is in neither side's interest."
Relations between Moscow and Brussels have long been strained. The EU imposed sanctions on Moscow following 
both the imprisonment of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny and the annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 
Ukraine. Moscow responded with countermeasures.
According to the statement, Michel - one of the bloc's most senior officials - raised the issue of Ukraine and also of 
Belarus, an increasingly close ally of Moscow and also the subject of recent EU sanctions.
Michel "reiterated the EU's assessment of the forced landing of the Ryanair flight by the Belarusian authorities," the 
press release continued, referring to an incident last month that triggered the introduction of an EU flight ban for 
Belarusian airlines.
Belarus must release political prisoners and stop domestic repression, Michel said, repeating previous EU 
statements.
"Russia can play an important role in supporting a peaceful settlement of the crisis," he urged.
EU leaders are in the process of reviewing their joint policy towards Russia, with the next debate set for a summit 
later this month.

 The United States, Britain and the European Union should act jointly to put more pressure on Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko and his government, opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya (pictured) told Reuters on 
Friday (4 June), writes Joanna Plucinska[1]. 
Tsikhanouskaya made the comments during a visit to Warsaw, Poland ahead of a summit of the G7 rich countries 
in Britain next week, at which she hopes issues raised by the Belarusian opposition will be addressed. Belarus has 
shot up the international agenda since it forced down a Ryanair flight over its air space and arrested an opposition 
journalist last month. 
"Pressure is more powerful when these countries are acting jointly and we are calling on [the] UK, the USA, the 
European Union and Ukraine. They have to act jointly so their voice will be more loud," Tsikhanouskaya said. 
France has said it would like to invite the Belarusian opposition to the G7 summit[2], if host country Britain agrees. 
Britain has said there are no plans to invite further delegations, but that Belarus would be discussed. 
Tsikhanouskaya said she had not been invited to the summit but expected Belarus would be discussed there. 
Britain, the United States and the European Union all imposed bans and asset freezes on some Belarus officials 
after an election last year that the opposition says was rigged. 
Since the Ryanair incident, Western countries have discouraged their airlines from flying over Belarus and said they 
will take other steps, such as barring Belarusian airlines and adding more names to their blacklists. 
Some opposition figures have called for stronger measures that would have an impact on the overall Belarusian 
economy, such as restrictions on imports of minerals or oil from Belarus.

Highlight: The rapid nature of Portugal's move from 'green' to 'amber' last week will further dent UK traveller 
confidence, just when things were starting to look up for companies and consumers.
Body
An unwanted change from out of the blueRoughly one month ago, it was announced that Portugal would be on the 
UK's green list, meaning that quarantine on return would not be enforced if the passenger tests negative. This 
announcement unleashed a high level of pent-up demand within the UK market, with bookings skyrocketing to 
Portugal and airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair adding thousands of extra seats over the summer period. This 
announcement was meant to signal the meaningful start of recovery for UK airlines and the opening of sun and 
beach holidays for UK travellers. 
Over half (53%) of UK consumers typically go on sun and beach holidays according to GlobalData*, with Portugal a 
popular destination for this type of trip. In terms of visitation, the UK was the second largest source market for 
Portugal in 2019, emphasising its popularity with UK travellers. Fast forward one month and airlines - along with 
travellers - have been left angered by Portugal rapidly being switched from green to amber. Travel companies were 
hardly given any warning of the coming change and the impact will result in many disgruntled customers that won't 
be able to receive refunds. More importantly, it will further dent UK traveller confidence, which will impact bookings 
in the short-to-medium term. A further setback for booking confidenceThe rapid nature of the change will take many 
travellers back to 2020, where constant revisions of travel restrictions left many scrambling for refunds, creating the 
initial dent in UK traveler confidence. The recent introduction of green list countries would have brought a sense of 
security to many travellers that could have been stung by cancellations last year, giving them confidence to book. 
However, the safety of a green list country will now mean little to many UK travellers, having now learned that a 
destination's green list status can be revoked at any time with little warning. According to GlobalData**, 38% of UK 
consumers 'somewhat' or 'completely' agree that their budget has reduced in the last year and 86% are still 'quite' 
or 'extremely' concerned regarding the current pandemic. Concerns surrounding personal finances and the 
pandemic, combined with green list countries quickly turning to amber will no doubt damage UK traveller confidence 
even further. This will extend the recovery process for all businesses involved in the supply of outbound tourism 
from the UK.

 An expert's point of view on a current event. 
 June 7, 2021, 1:55 PM  
 The European Union's ban of the Belarusian state-owned airline from its territory, which went into effect overnight 
last Friday, is just the latest punitive measure by the West against Minsk. The EU and United States are rightly 
developing various new sanctions after Belarusian authorities hijacked Ryanair flight 4978 traveling between Athens 
and Vilnius, Lithuania, on May 23 in order to arrest Roman Protasevich, an independent Belarusian journalist who 
had fled the regime but was onboard the flight. 
 The problem is that minor reprisals are unlikely to impress Belarusian dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko. To be 
effective, the Western response must go beyond symbolic sanctions by inflicting real pressure on the regime while 
finding tangible ways to help the Belarusian people. 
 In addition to banning[1] Belarusian airliners and calling on EU-based carriers to avoid[2] Belarus, the European 
Union[3] says it will also sanction[4] those responsible for the hijacking and impose[5] targeted economic 
sanctions[6] to squeeze the Lukashenko regime's finances. The White House likewise said[7] it will suspend a 2019 
air services agreement with Belarus and discourage travel to or through Belarus. The Biden administration is also 
coordinating with European allies to develop targeted sanctions against Lukashenko regime officials and will craft a 
new executive order expanding the administration's authority to sanction 'elements of the [Lukashenko] regime, its 
support network, and those that support corruption, the abuse of human rights, and attacks on democracy.' 
 The West must now follow through. As the European Parliament president[8] said after the hijacking, a 'strong, 
immediate, and unified' EU response is necessary 'to show that the union is not a paper tiger'—that it can act 
decisively on the world stage to protect its interests and values. Likewise, the U.S. response will test the Biden 
administration's promises[9] to revitalize[10] trans-Atlantic relations, restore[11] U.S. global leadership, stand up[12] 
for human rights, and defend the liberal rules-based order against authoritarian threats[13]. Most important, of 
course, is the plight of the Belarusian people, who continue to face extraordinary repression at the hands of 
Lukashenko's brutal regime. 
To Get at Lukashenko, Punish His 'Moneybags'
Sanctioning the security, judicial, and other officials responsible for hijacking[14] the plane and mistreating 
Protasevich would be a good start. But those kinds of sanctions are mainly symbolic. Lukashenko (and other 
authoritarians[15] the world over, who will surely be watching closely) would likely see such a response as a mere 
slap on the wrist—a license to keep acting with impunity. Indeed, the West's 'nine months of wet noodle 
international responses to repressive moves since the stolen #Belarus election,' as a former Canadian ambassador 
to Ukraine, Roman Waschuk, put it[16], may have helped convince[17] Lukashenko he could get away with the 
hijacking in the first place. 
 To make the regime pay a real price, the West should go after Lukashenko's money. It could start by heeding the 
opposition's call[18] to sanction[19] Lukashenko's 'wallets,' as it calls the wealthy Belarusian businesspeople close 
to Lukashenko. The dictator has enabled[20] them to boost[21] their business interests in return for support to his 
regime, including by allegedly acting as straw men to hold large chunks of the Lukashenko family's fortune. As 
former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State David Kramer has argued[22], targeting these 'moneybags' and their 
companies could help 'water down the thin ice on which Lukashenko stands.' 
 Washington, for its part, should begin by sanctioning Aliaksandr Shakutsin[23] and Mikalai Varabei[24], two 
businessmen Brussels sanctioned[25] back in December 2020, saying they are both 'benefiting from and supporting 
the [Lukashenko] regime.' Varabei's company Interservice[26] is Belarus's largest[27] private petrochemical 
exporter and has expanded rapidly since 2012, not least thanks to a Lukashenko decree transferring[28] state 
assets to him to create an oil refinery. Varabei is also co-owner of Bremino Group, a major logistics operator that 
has received tax breaks and other regime support. 
 Shakutsin, meanwhile, is reportedly 'one of the persons who benefited most from the privatisation during 
Lukashenko's tenure,' as the EU noted. He reportedly[29] was one of a handful of businesspeople present during 
Lukashenko's September 2020 inauguration ceremony, held in secret[30] amid ongoing mass demonstrations 
against what is widely seen as a stolen election. Shakutsin has complained loudly[31] about the EU sanctions, 
which is a good sign: It indicates the potential for further sanctions to foment resentment toward Lukashenko among 
the Belarusian elite. 
 Other worthy sanctions targets[32] include former regime officials Aliaksandr Zaitsau[33] and Aliaksei Aleksin[34], 
two additional co-owners of Bremino Group. Zaitsau and Aleksin have reportedly used offshore financial networks 
in the EU to move money[35], potentially making them vulnerable to targeted financial sanctions. Aleksin and others 
close to Lukashenko allegedly control the Belarusian cigarette smuggling[36] industry, the main provider of 
contraband cigarettes in Europe and an important revenue generator for the regime. The EU should finally get 
serious about cracking down on this illicit trade. 
 Robust sanctions enforcement will be key. Alongside Shakutsin, Varabei, and others sanctioned[37] in December 
2020, the EU targeted the top Belarusian real estate and construction firm Dana Holdings and its subsidiary Dana 
Astra, both owned by the family of Serbian businessman Bogoljub Karic. The Karic family has long-standing ties[38] 
to Lukashenko, whose daughter-in-law allegedly has held a high-ranking position at Dana Astra. The regime has 
handed roughly $1 billion in prime Minsk real estate to Karic-owned construction companies. Yet just days before 
Brussels imposed sanctions against the companies last December, an unsanctioned offshore company[39] 
reportedly replaced Dana Holdings as the owner of multiple construction firms, allowing them to continue doing 
business in Europe. That company should also face sanctions—and so should the Karics themselves. 
 Proper enforcement will also require designating family members and other fronts who hold sanctioned 
businesspeople's assets. For example, data from the 2016 Panama Papers investigation revealed[40] that family 
members of Belarusian businessman Vladimir Peftiev owned roughly $25 million worth of London real estate 
through a web of offshore shell companies. Most of that real estate was purchased while Peftiev was under 
sanctions[41] imposed in 2011 by the EU, which called him a 'key financial sponsor of the Lukashenko regime.' 
(Those sanctions were later annulled.) 
Furthermore, sanctions targeting not just the national airline but also the Belarusian financial sector and vital oil, 
petrochemical, and potash exports, which EU foreign ministers have been discussing[42], would offer a particularly 
powerful source of leverage. While many observers rightly note that such sanctions would risk harming ordinary 
Belarusians and making Minsk even more reliant on Moscow, implementing sanctions gradually—with successive 
rounds contingent on Lukashenko's behavior—could mitigate these risks while pushing the dictator to ease 
repression. Indeed, the specter[43] of further losing his autonomy[44] vis--vis Russia, something Lukashenko has 
tried stubbornly to avoid, could incentivize him to reduce Western pressure. Certain Western sanctions could even 
To Get at Lukashenko, Punish His 'Moneybags'
undermine Russian economic influence in Belarus: After the United States announced in April that it would 
reimpose[45] previous sanctions against Belarus's Naftan oil refinery and eight other state-owned entities, large 
Russian oil exporters suspended supplies to Naftan, prompting[46] Minsk to ask Kazakhstan to fill the gap. 
 But the West should not limit itself to sanctions. As the scholar Mark Galeotti has argued[47], for example, Western 
countries should coordinate mass expulsions of Belarusian KGB officers working under diplomatic cover. (Some 
KGB officers reportedly tailed Protasevich on his flight.) These expulsions, along with suspending[48] Belarus from 
Interpol, could help curtail the regime's ability to intimidate[49] the many Belarusian journalists, activists, and 
opposition figures who've fled abroad. It was precisely this kind of intimidation that was Lukashenko's likely goal in 
hijacking the plane. 
 At the same time, the West should increase support for and engagement with the Belarusian opposition, 
independent media, and civil society. While the EU has pledged[50] up to 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) to support 
Belarus following a potential democratic transition, the Belarusian people need help now. This is particularly 
important after Minsk announced[51] new rules last week making it nearly impossible to flee the country. In the very 
near term, this support could include inviting opposition leaders to the G-7 summit this weekend, as French 
President Emmanuel Macron has suggested[52]. The EU should also appoint[53] a special representative for 
Belarus to help sustain the bloc's focus and coordinate among member states. 
 Over the long haul, as the journalist Leonid Ragozin has argued[54], the EU should 'provide people like 
[Protasevich] with safe havens and opportunities to do their work,' for example by 'removing visa hurdles and 
simplifying residence rules for people who can influence their compatriots back home.' The West should also 
consider how it can help ordinary Belarusians circumvent the regime's[55] information censorship[56]. This support 
can help the Belarusian people continue resisting Lukashenko's ongoing crackdowns, while preventing his 
repression from severing EU engagement with the increasingly[57] European-minded Belarusian population. 
 The West has an opportunity to defend its interests and values by standing firmly with the Belarusian people. It 
must not let this moment pass by.

NATO's head has warned Russia and Belarus against threatening the alliance's allies, following the forced landing 
of a passenger plane within the EU by Belarusian authorities, in comments published on Sunday.
"We are of course ready, in an emergency, to protect and defend any ally against any kind of threat coming from 
Minsk and Moscow," NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
"We are vigilant and we are following what is happening in Belarus very closely," he said.
Belarus is becoming "more and more dependent" on Russia, he added.
Stoltenberg said NATO was seriously concerned about the closer cooperation between Moscow and Minsk in 
recent months. "We have had to learn in the past that Russia has massively violated the territorial integrity of states 
such as Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova," he said.
He did not want to speculate too much, Stoltenberg said, noting, "NATO is a defensive alliance."
Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, all members of NATO, share borders with Belarus.
Two weeks ago, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko forced a Ryanair commercial flight between two 
EU capitals, Athens and Vilnius, to make an emergency landing in Minsk.
Dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, passengers on the plane, were arrested 
and are being held in custody.
While the EU responded with sanctions on Belarus, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Lukashenko for talks 
and said Moscow would support Belarus with 500 million dollars in credit.
Putin also underlined his continuing support for Lukashenko in his confrontation with the West.

Putin also underlined his continuing support for Lukashenko in his confrontation with the West.
Stoltenberg also said that the situation in Belarus would be discussed at a NATO summit in Brussels due to be held 
in a week, where attendees will include US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
He said the current partnership agreement (PFP) with Belarus had recently been significantly scaled back and that 
this would continue to be reviewed.
NATO is meanwhile pursuing a two-pronged approach with Russia, consisting of deterrence and dialogue, he said, 
adding, "we are sticking with that."
NATO must remain in dialogue "with our neighbour Russia" about arms control and other military and political 
challenges, particularly in difficult times, he said.
"If we don't talk to each other, we can neither settle our disputes nor improve mutual understanding."

EU formalises bloc-wide ban on Belarusian carriers
EU formalises bloc-wide ban on Belarusian carriers

The Council of the European Union has adopted a regulation banning all Belarus-flagged carriers and aircraft from 
conducting operations to and over the bloc as of June 5, 2021. Regulation 2021/907 was adopted as a 
formalisation of guidelines issued by the council, a body comprising heads of EU states and governments, on May 
24, 2021. The non-binding recommendations sought to penalise Belarus for the forced May 23 diversion of a 
Ryanair B737-800, en-route from Athens Int'l to Vilnius, followed by the arrest of two opposition journalists who 
were on board. While the recommendations were not binding, a number of EU member states - including all three of 
Belarus's EU neighbours - Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland - as well as non-EU member Ukraine - unilaterally banned 
all Belarusian carriers. The move effectively cut off Belarus carriers from the EU as they have only been able to 
enter and leave the country eastward via Russia. 
The regulation does, however, allow exceptions in the event of emergency landings and humanitarian operations. 
The ban also covers all flights operated by Belarusian airlines as marketing carriers, effectively stopping them from 
code-sharing on any services to the EU. According to the ch-aviation schedules module, flag carrier Belavia had a 
single code-share agreement wherein it placed its code on services to the EU, namely with LOT Polish Airlines on 
services to Warsaw Chopin. Belavia is the only Belarus carrier that operates scheduled flights and was the only one 
that regularly flew to the EU. Other carriers that had been authorised to fly to the EU by EASA included cargo 
specialists Genex, BySky, Rada Airlines, and Rubystar Airways. On June 2, the European Union Aviation Safety 
Agency (EASA) also ramped up its sanctions on Belarus, upgrading its earlier non-biding safety information bulletin 
prohibiting overflights above Belarus, to a binding safety directive. The regulator ordered all carriers under its 
jurisdiction (which covers all EU and EFTA countries) to avoid Belarusian airspace except for emergencies. The 
vast majority of EASA-regulated carriers already did so after the May 23 incident. The directive is not binding for 
airlines registered outside EASA's jurisdiction, including Russian, Chinese, and American carriers. Airline 
organisation IATA labelled the upgrade from a non-binding bulletin to a binding directive "a retrograde and 
disappointing development" which shows the influence of politics on the aviation industry. "Aviation safety must 
never be politicised. IATA condemned the actions of the Belarus government and called for an independent 
investigation. Banning European aircraft from using Belarusian airspace with a Safety Directive is also a 
politicisation of aviation safety. EASA should rescind its prohibition and allow airlines to manage safety as they do 
each and every day - with their normal operational risk assessments. Two wrongs do not make a right," IATA 
Director General Willie Walsh said. "EASA will monitor the developments in relation with this case and will adjust 
the recommendations accordingly. Such reviews will be done whenever the circumstances will require it and in any 
case at intervals not exceeding one month," the regulator added.

 US President Joe Biden has pledged solidarity with allies against the Kremlin's "challenges to European security." 
"Putin knows that I won't hesitate to respond to future harmful activities," Biden said.The US will stand with 
European allies against Russia, President Joe Biden said ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir 
Putin. 
"We are standing united to address Russia's challenges to European security, starting with its aggression in 
Ukraine," Biden wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post published on Saturday. 
Biden said he has been "clear and direct" in previous phone calls with Putin. 
"The United States does not seek conflict. We want a stable and predictable relationship where we can work with 
Russia on issues like strategic stability and arms control," he wrote. However, he added: "Putin knows that I will not 
hesitate to respond to future harmful activities." 
Biden is scheduled to head to Europe on Wednesday for both the G7 and NATO summits. He is then expected to 
meet Putin face-to-face in Geneva on June 16. 
Biden on China and Russia 
Biden said his trip to Europe "is about realizing America's renewed commitment" to allies and to "deter the threats 
of this new age." 
He added that the US "must lead the world from a position of strength," whether it is ending the COVID-19 
pandemic worldwide or addressing climate change. 
But the US president notably used the op-ed to highlight what he called "challenges" imposed by China and Russia. 
Biden said Washington would play a global role in "confronting the harmful activities of the governments of China 
and Russia." 
"We will focus on ensuring that market democracies, not China or anyone else, write the 21st-century rules around 
trade and technology," he said, adding that world democracies should work together to expose and counter 
"ransomware attacks," "cyberattacks" and "invasive AI-driven surveillance." 
Biden leaves out Belarus 
Since assuming office in January, Biden has ramped up pressure on Russia, slamming the Kremlin for repeated 
human rights abuses. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday warned Russia and Belarus against threatening the alliance, 
following the forced landing of a Ryanair commercial flight between Athens and Vilnius in Minsk. 
Biden says US stands with European allies ahead of Putin summit
The former Soviet republic has escalated repression against independent journalists and peaceful protesters in the 
past five months. 
However, Biden did not comment on Belarus in the op-ed.

 US President Joe Biden has pledged solidarity with allies against the Kremlin's "challenges to European security." 
"Putin knows that I won't hesitate to respond to future harmful activities," Biden said.The US will stand with 
European allies against Russia, President Joe Biden said ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir 
Putin. 
"We are standing united to address Russia's challenges to European security, starting with its aggression in 
Ukraine," Biden wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post published on Saturday. 
Biden said he has been "clear and direct" in previous phone calls with Putin. 
"The United States does not seek conflict. We want a stable and predictable relationship where we can work with 
Russia on issues like strategic stability and arms control," he wrote. However, he added: "Putin knows that I will not 
hesitate to respond to future harmful activities." 
Biden is scheduled to head to Europe on Wednesday for both the G7 and NATO summits. He is then expected to 
meet Putin face-to-face in Geneva on June 16. 
Biden on China and Russia 
Biden said his trip to Europe "is about realizing America's renewed commitment" to allies and to "deter the threats 
of this new age." 
He added that the US "must lead the world from a position of strength," whether it is ending the COVID-19 
pandemic worldwide or addressing climate change. 
But the US president notably used the op-ed to highlight what he called "challenges" imposed by China and Russia. 
Biden said Washington would play a global role in "confronting the harmful activities of the governments of China 
and Russia." 
"We will focus on ensuring that market democracies, not China or anyone else, write the 21st-century rules around 
trade and technology," he said, adding that world democracies should work together to expose and counter 
"ransomware attacks," "cyberattacks" and "invasive AI-driven surveillance." 
Biden leaves out Belarus 
Since assuming office in January, Biden has ramped up pressure on Russia, slamming the Kremlin for repeated 
human rights abuses. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Sunday warned Russia and Belarus against threatening the alliance, 
following the forced landing of a Ryanair commercial flight between Athens and Vilnius in Minsk. 
Biden says US stands with European allies ahead of Putin summit
The former Soviet republic has escalated repression against independent journalists and peaceful protesters in the 
past five months. 
However, Biden did not comment on Belarus in the op-ed.

 A woman assaulted passengers on a Ryanair flight after she refused to wear a mask, the New Zealand Herald[1] 
reported. Video footage shows her pulling a passenger's hair and kicking two men. She was handed over to police 
officers at Milan Bergamo airport after the flight landed, Ryanair said. See more stories on Insider's business 
page[2]. 
A woman was filmed attacking fellow passengers after being called out for not wearing a mask on a flight, the New 
Zealand Herald[3] reported. 
Viral footage shows the woman wearing a facemask on her chin while she verbally assaults passengers. 
As tensions escalate, she can be seen pulling at a woman's hair before spitting at others on board the Ryanair flight 
from Ibiza to Milan Bergamo on May 26.

Later in the clip, crew members try to escort her off the plane. While being held back, she kicks two men. 
"The crew of this flight from Ibiza to Milan Bergamo (26 May) requested police assistance upon arrival after a 
passenger became disruptive in-flight," a Ryanair spokesperson told Insider. 
"The aircraft landed normally, and police removed the individual at Milan Bergamo airport. This is now a matter for 
local police," the spokesperson added. 
Unruly passengers[6] are a growing problem for airlines, Insider's Allana Akhtar[7] reported. 
The Federal Aviation Administration, an American civil aviation agency, said it had received 2,500 reports of 
disorderly behavior by passengers since January 2021. About 1,900 of the reports deal with passengers who 
refused to comply with the federal facemask mandate. 
In April, Southwest Airlines passengers danced and cheered[8] as a couple accused of refusing to wear masks 
were thrown off a flight. 
In late May, a Southwest Airlines passenger punched a flight attendant in the face[9] after repeatedly ignoring in-
flight instructions. Read the original article on Business Insider[10]

Ryanair says first 737 MAX delivery delayed by Boeing due to FAA issue
Ryanair says first 737 MAX delivery delayed by Boeing due to FAA issue

Ryanair RYA.I may decline to accept delivery of its first Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX jet until after the summer following 
a delay caused by paperwork related to a version of the jet designed for the airline, a senior executive said on 
Thursday.
The Irish airline, the largest European customer for the MAX, is still waiting for Boeing to provide a date for the 
delivery of its first jet, a 197-seat MAX200, and will decide then if it can take it during its busy summer season, the 
executive said.
"We need a definitive date as to when we're going to get the airplane and then we've got to decide ... whether that 
suits us to take them or not because in the normal course of events we don't take aircraft in the summer months," 
said Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair DAC, the main airline in the Ryanair Group.
Wilson, speaking to Reuters in an interview, said the delay was related to paperwork required for the MAX200 
model, which has an extra door to allow more passengers than the standard model, and appeared to hinge on the 
relationship between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration.
"The release of that aircraft ... has to do with a fairly straightforward issue. And it's how the interface between 
Boeing and the FAA is going to work in matters like that and they have to iron that out once and for all," Wilson 
said.
"It's really up to Boeing at Seattle to bed in that relationship with the FAA in dealing with issues of certification and 
how they have to do things differently. That's what it looks like," he said.
Asked about the comments, a Boeing spokeswoman said: "We continue to work closely with Ryanair to deliver their 
first 737-8-200s."
Ryanair was initially due to take delivery of its first MAX two years ago before the jet was grounded for 20 months 
after two fatal crashes.
Since then the airline has announced repeated delays, cutting its planned deliveries in time for use in summer 2021 
from 40 to 16 to possibly zero.
Ryanair says first 737 MAX delivery delayed by Boeing due to FAA issue
Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary last month said he was upset with Boeing and did "not necessarily believe" 
a promise from the U.S. firm to deliver the first plane before the end of May.

Belarusian political scientist flees after being named in interview
Belarusian political scientist flees after being named in interview

Belarusian political scientist Artyom Shraibman, who was named by the dissident journalist detained after the forced 
landing of a passenger flight in Minsk, announced on Saturday that he has fled the country out of fear of also being 
imprisoned.
The journalist, 26-year-old Roman Protasevich, had said in an interview aired on Belarusian state media on 
Thursday, which was likely conducted under duress, that he had worked for the opposition abroad and gave names 
of several people he said were also involved.
However, Shraibman - one of those named - said that he had not worked for the Belarusian opposition and was 
only an observer and analyst.
He added that he saw Protasevich as a "hostage" taken by President Alexander Lukashenko and thus could not 
condemn him for the accusations. State media celebrated the news of Shraibman's "escape."
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who is also in exile, described Protasevich's interview as the 
result of torture and met with the journalist's parents in Poland on Saturday.
She has repeatedly called for the release of all political prisoners.
As of midnight on Saturday, the European Union is to seal off its skies and runways to Belarusian airlines in 
response to the forced diversion of a Ryanair flight and the detention of Protasevich.
Even before the sanctions decision, all airlines based in the bloc had been asked to avoid flights into Belarusian 
airspace.
Air travellers will probably only be able to reach Belarus now through detours, for example via Russia.

 Draped in white-red-white Belarusian opposition flags, exiled Belarusians protested on Saturday at the Polish 
frontier, calling for President Alexander Lukashenko to lift a border closure. 
"Europe: It's time for action!", "Impose Sanctions Please!" read some of the placards, as dozens of protesters lined 
a road clogged with hundreds of trucks waiting to go through border checks. 
"I have a feeling that an iron curtain is falling into place. It's frightening," said Lyubov Kovalchuk, who moved to 
Poland in December last year after being arrested for her activism.

"It's breaking up families," Kovalchuk, a 42-year-old with short ginger hair, told AFP. 
Standing just a few hundred metres from the border checkpoint, her friend Katya Mirzoyeva, 63, said her fellow 
Belarusians were "living in a cage". 
Belarus, a country of 9.5 million people, has been shaken by unprecedented mass protests since the disputed re-
election last year of Lukashenko, who has ruled since 1994 with the support of Russia. 
On December 22, Lukashenko announced the closure of the land border -- ostensibly because of the pandemic, 
although many Belarusians suspect it was another way to clamp down on protests. 
 They also demonstrated in cars Photo: AFP / Wojtek RADWANSKI  
 The border between Belarus and Poland, an EU and NATO member state, remains open for goods traffic. 
Kovalchuk said she had been able to travel back to Belarus twice because she had a visa for Poland.

But Belarus has now banned even people with foreign residence permits to leave following the international outcry 
after the arrest of a dissident journalist on a Ryanair flight that was diverted and forced to land in Minsk last month. 
The closure "shows the government is illegitimate. It is another form of violence on its own citizens, on 
Belarusians," said Tatsiana Kulevich, 26, who left last year and now lives in Bialystok in Poland. 
"It's frightening. People have to cross illegally or end up in prison," said Kulevich, who attended the protest with her 
husband Ruslan -- a journalist for the Belarusian news portal Hrodna.life. 
"A lot of people would like to leave because everyone is tired of living in fear," the 29-year-old said, as protesters 
played on drums and trumpets and some truckers honked their horns.

The couple said they were able to fly through Latvia but that option is no longer possible. 
'An Iron Curtain': Exiled Belarusians Protest On Border
Following the arrest of Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega from the diverted flight, the EU has now 
banned all flights from Belarus. 
That has made it even more difficult for the few who might have been able to leave to do so. 
But opposition supporters lay the blame for the situation squarely on Lukashenko. 
"It's Lukashenko who shut the land border," said Lena Zhivoglod, 30, an organiser of the border protests who was 
also forced to leave her country last year because of her political activism. 
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has urged Lukashenko to open the border for "emergency 
evacuations", saying there should be a chance for Belarusians to "escape the regime". 
Zhivoglod said protesters intended to stay for several days and may try to block trucks entering from Belarus in 
order to make the point that the EU should impose economic sanctions. 
"Belarusians have no time for measured action. We are asking Europe to adopt massive, immediate and effective 
sanctions," she said. 
The EU has threatened economic sanctions, possibly against lucrative Belarusian exports such as oil, gas and 
potash, which is used to make fertiliser. 
The trade turnover between Belarus and Poland before the pandemic hit in 2019 totalled around $3 billion (2.5 
billion euros). 
In normal times, many Belarusians also travel to or emigrate to Poland. In 2019, Poland issued around 400,000 
visas for Belarusian nationals. 
For now, there is little exiled Belarusians can do but watch the diplomacy swirling around their homeland and hope 
something will change. 
"We're waiting, we're waiting," said Ruslan Kulevich. Pointing to the protest, he added: "Maybe this will somehow 
help open up the border."

Airlines bosses have reacted with anger to the decision by the UK government to remove Portugal from the green 
list of countries that can be visited without quarantine.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair PLC's (LON:RYA) chief executive, said the move wasn't based on any science or public 
health.
"What we don't understand is why the UK, which has been so successful with vaccines, is expecting its vaccinated 
citizens travelling to Portugal coming back to quarantine," he told the BBC.
Johan Lundgren, easyJet PLC's (LON:EZJ) chief executive added that while its fleet in Europe was gearing up for 
summer travel the UK remains grounded as the government is making it impossible to plan ahead.
Politicians in Portugal also expressed disappointment and said they did not understand the logic behind the 
decision with the infection rate there officially only marginally higher than in the UK.
The country is now amber-rated on the government's traffic light system, which means only essential travel is 
allowed and anyone coming back to the UK from visiting has to self-isolate for ten days and take Covid-19 tests on 
days two and eight.
The new rules, which also saw Afghanistan, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Egypt, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Trinidad and 
Tobago added to the red list, come into force on 8 June.
Ryanair and EasyJet bosses angry at Portugal 's amber rating
Tour operator Tui Ag (LON:TUI) said half of the passengers who had booked to fly to Portugal this year are going 
ahead with their trips and it was not scheduling extra flights to bring holidaymakers home ahead of Tuesday.
The travel firm currently has about 8,000 UK visitors in Portugal, though this will drop to 2,000 at the end of this 
week when the UK half-term school holiday ends.
Robert Jenrick, Communities Secretary, said the government had been concerned about a new strain of Covid-19 
known as the Nepal variant in making its decision about Portugal.
"We don't know yet whether it is going to be a problem, but our scientists are doing research as we speak, they are 
looking at whether it is more transmissible, whether it is more virulent, and above all whether or not our current set 
of vaccines are effective against it."
O'Leary said that Ryanair passengers booked for Portugal would be able to rebook flights for later in the summer 
and it was still intending to operate extra flights to the country to meet the demand.
Shares in Ryanair dropped 1.2% to (EURO)16.19 while easyJet slipped 1.7% to 943p though TUI rose slightly to 
422p.

The European Union will seal off its skies and runways to Belarusian airlines as of Saturday in response to the 
forced diversion of a Ryanair flight and detention of a dissident journalist and his girlfriend last month.
The 27 countries are obliged "to deny permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories to any aircraft 
operated by Belarusian air carriers," the bloc announced on Friday after member states envoys in Brussels formally 
signed off the move.
Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich and Sofia Sapega were on board a commercial flight between EU 
countries Greece and Lithuania that was rerouted to Minsk shortly before it reached Vilnius due to an alleged bomb 
threat. No bomb was found, but both were detained.
The bloc slammed the act as an affront to both air safety and freedom of the press.
The EU has also called on all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarusian territory.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) condemned Minsk's behaviour but also criticized the EU.
"Two wrongs do not make a right. Politics should never interfere with the safe operation of aircraft and politicians 
should never use aviation safety as a cover to pursue political or diplomatic agendas," Willie Walsh, IATA's director 
general, said in a statement.
The bloc is also preparing a package of economic sanctions on individuals involved in the incident, but this could 
still take some time to finalize, according to dpa's diplomatic sources.

Portugal and Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) have drawn battle lines after the Irish budget carrier won its challenge in the 
European Union General Court to block Portuguese state aid for struggling national carrier TAP Air Portugal (TP, 
Lisbon). Portugal's Minister of Infrastructure and Housing, Pedro Nuno Santos, has accused Ryanair of meddling in 
the country's internal affairs and systematically attacking TAP to gain market share. He has warned Ryanair not to 
expect any cooperation from the Portuguese state from now on and cautioned it to respect the country's labour laws 
regarding employing local pilots and crews. He further accused Ryanair of commercial opportunism, saying while its 
investment in Portugal was welcome, it was only doing so for commercial gain. Ryanair Group Chief Executive 
Officer Michael O'Leary dismissed the allegations. 
He called on Santos to "stop wasting taxpayers' money on TAP, and invest in infrastructure". "His immediate priority 
should be the opening of Montijo, where Ryanair could - within two years - deliver five million passengers and 
create over 5,000 new, very well paid jobs in Lisbon." The proposed establishment of a new Lisbon secondary 
international airport at Montijo has been mired by controversy and local government opposition. Their comments 
followed a video conference call on May 26, which O'Leary dismissed as "interesting although pointless". 
Responding to Santos' charges, he said: "We condemn his false claims over recent days that Ryanair is waging a 
commercial war when this is called competition. We also reject his false claims that Ryanair engages in 'social 
dumping' when we pay our cabin crew more than double what his government pays Portuguese nurses and 
teachers in a year." The face-off follows after Ryanair welcomed the EU court's rulings on May 19 that EUR1.2 
billion euros (USD1.4 billion) in Portuguese state aid to TAP was in breach of European Union law. Ryanair had 
argued the aid - greenlighted by the European Commission in June last year - had been anti-competitive, rewarded 
inefficiency, and had reversed the clock on air transport liberalisation in Europe. Responding in a strongly-worded 
statement, Santos accused Ryanair of interfering in decisions taken by the Portuguese government. "Portugal is a 
sovereign and democratic state, and the government does not accept intrusions or lessons from a foreign airline 
that is only answerable to its shareholders." "The investment in TAP is a strategic and structuring investment, not 
only in the airline but in the Portuguese economy. This is because TAP's impact on the national economy far 
exceeds the company's net results. TAP guarantees, in a normal year, EUR3 billion (USD3.6 billion) in exports to 
Portugal, EUR1.3 billion (USD1.5 billion) in purchases from more than a thousand companies throughout the 
national territory. It is the company that transports the most passengers to and from Portugal, and it is, in addition to 
all this, an essential company to improve connectivity between Portugal and the EU and the rest of the world," 
Santos stated. For his part, O'Leary pointed out that Ryanair was one of the largest overseas investors in Portugal, 
having placed more than USD2 billion worth of aircraft at its four Portuguese bases in Lisbon, Porto, Faro, and 
Portugal , Ryanair draw battle lines over TAP
Ponta Delgada. Ryanair had also expanded in Porto when TAP closed its base there. "In Summer 2021, Ryanair 
will operate over 120 routes to/from Portugal. This is almost double the 70 routes offered by TAP," he said. During 
the call, O'Leary had offered to further invest in Ryanair's IT teams in Lisbon and offered to discuss with Santos the 
opportunity to open aircraft maintenance bases in Portugal, each of which would bring 300 to 500 more engineering 
jobs. "Minister Santos wasn't interested in these infrastructure discussions. All he wants to do is subsidise TAP and 
criticise Ryanair," he said. As previously reported the EU state aid secured TAP's immediate liquidity needs last 
year after the airline reported a record EUR1.2 billion (USD1.4 billion) loss amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
exchange, the Portuguese government acquired 22.5%, now owning 72.5% of holding company TAP SGPS, and 
submitted a restructuring plan for TAP to the EC. If Brussels rejects this plan, which involves a proposed 2,000 job 
cuts by 2022 and pay cuts of up to 25%, TAP will have to repay the rescue loan, which could lead to its insolvency.

In Belarus, state television has shown a long interview with imprisoned government critic Roman Protasevich for the 
first time.
In the interview with the broadcaster ONT, which was aired on Thursday evening, the 26-year-old blogger admitted 
to having organized protests against strongman ruler Alexander Lukashenko. At the same time, he said that he 
admired Lukashenko.
His mother Natalia Protasevich, who lives in Poland, described the interview on Friday as the result of torture in 
prison.
"I can't even imagine the torture methods - both psychological and physical - that my son is being subjected to at 
the moment," the 46-year-old told dpa. "You probably can't suffer a greater torture as a mother."
In the one-and-a-half-hour conversation, Protasevich also made accusations against other members of the 
Belarusian opposition, sometimes in a trembling voice.
Protasevich's parents had already expressed the suspicion that their son was being mistreated in prison and forced 
to make statements.
Lukashenko had forced a passenger plane to reroute and land in Minsk almost a fortnight ago and had Protasevich 
and his girlfriend arrested.
The incident - involving a Ryanair commercial flight between the two EU capitals of Athens and Vilnius - has 
intensified the conflict between the former Soviet republic and the West. The EU and the US imposed new 
sanctions on Belarus as a result.

In Belarus, state television has shown a long interview with imprisoned government critic Roman Protasevich for the 
first time, with the opposition and the blogger's family believing he was made to do the video under duress.
In the interview with the broadcaster ONT, which was aired on Thursday evening, the 26-year-old blogger admitted 
to having organized protests against strongman ruler Alexander Lukashenko. At the same time, he said that he 
admired Lukashenko.
His mother Natalia Protasevich, who lives in Poland, described the interview on Friday as the result of torture in 
prison.
"I can't even imagine the torture methods - both psychological and physical - that my son is being subjected to at 
the moment," the 46-year-old told dpa. "You probably can't suffer a greater torture as a mother."
Protasevich also pointed to her son's wrists which she said showed dark spots and inflammation.
The blogger's mother called for independent doctors to be allowed to examine her son. "They should also do blood 
analysis of what he is being injected with." Protasevich's lawyer had been denied access to him this week, she said.
Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, referring to the interview, said Protasevich was surely 
tortured and the international community should not pay heed to such extorted statements.
"All such videos are done under pressure," Tikhanovskaya said at a press conference in Warsaw on Friday. 
"[Through using violence] you can make a person say whatever you want."
When a person is in a political prison, the aim is to survive: "We don't have to pay attention" to such statements, the 
Belarusian opposition leader said.

A long interview on Belarusian TV with imprisoned government critic Roman Protasevich has provoked an angry 
reaction from several European countries.
In the interview with the broadcaster ONT, which was aired on Thursday evening, the 26-year-old blogger admitted 
to having organized protests against strongman ruler Alexander Lukashenko. At the same time, he said that he 
admired Lukashenko.
German government spokesman Steffen Seibert described it as "a completely undignified and implausible 
confession interview" that was probably obtained under psychological and physical duress.
"Mr Protasevich's disturbing interview last night was clearly under duress and in detention," British Foreign 
Secretary Dominic Raab wrote on Twitter.
"Those involved in the filming, coercion and direction of the interview must be held accountable," he said.
Protasevich and his girlfriend were arrested in Minsk a fortnight ago after Lukashenko forced a passenger plane to 
reroute and land in the Belarusian capital.
The incident - involving a Ryanair commercial flight between the two EU capitals of Athens and Vilnius - has 
intensified the conflict between the former Soviet republic and the West.
The EU and the US imposed fresh sanctions on Belarus as a result; some sanctions had already been in place 
since elections last year that have been discredited by many countries.
Moscow has however stood by Minsk in the dispute.

 Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Friday dismissed an interview shown on state television 
in Belarus with a journalist arrested after his plane was forced to land in Minsk. 
"All such videos are shot under pressure. We don't have to pay attention even to these words because they are 
done after torture... The task of political prisoners is to survive," she told reporters. 
"With the help of violence, you can make a person say whatever (you) want," Tikhanovskaya, who ran against 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in an election last year, said during a visit to Warsaw. 
Journalist and activist Roman Protasevich was arrested on May 23 along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega when their 
Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius was diverted and intercepted by a fighter jet. 
The interview with him was broadcast on Thursday. 
Looking uncomfortable in the video, Protasevich -- the co-founder and former editor of opposition Telegram channel 
Nexta which galvanised anti-government demonstrations -- confessed to calling for protests last year and praised 
Lukashenko. 
At the end of the 1.5-hour interview broadcast by Belarus state-run channel ONT Thursday evening, Protasevich 
began crying and covered his face with his hands. 
 The 26-year-old's father, Dmitry Protasevich, told AFP on Thursday that the video was the result of "abuse, torture 
and threats." 
"I know my son very well and I believe that he would never say such things," he told AFP. 
"They broke him and forced him to say what was needed," he said, adding it pained him to watch the interview. 
"I am very worried."

Belarusian authorities accuse Protasevich of organising mass riots, a charge that could land him in prison for 15 
years. 
Ahead of the broadcast, independent rights group Viasna said that Protasevich must have been coerced into 
speaking by Belarusian security services because he is facing "unfair, but very serious accusations". 
"Everything Protasevich will say was said under duress -- at the very least psychological duress," Viasna head Ales 
Bialiatski told AFP Thursday. 
"Whatever he is saying now is pure propaganda, under which there is no truthful basis." 
Belarus Opposition Leader Says Jailed Activist Spoke 'Under Pressure'
Protasevich and Sapega were accused of helping to coordinate historic demonstrations that broke out following 
Lukashenko's disputed re-election last August. 
Immediately after their arrest both Protasevich and Sapega appeared in "confession" videos that their supporters 
said were also recorded under duress and are a common tactic of the regime to pressure critics. 
Protasevich's parents said at the time their son looked like he had been beaten in the video. 
In response to the arrests, the European Union banned Belarusian state carrier Belavia from operating flights to 
airports in the bloc and discouraged EU-based airlines from flying over the ex-Soviet country. 
In response to the protests, Belarus authorities waged a brutal crackdown on the opposition and civil society, 
detaining and imprisoning thousands of demonstrators and pushing opposition leaders into exile. Several people 
died in the unrest.

 Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya on Friday dismissed an interview shown on state television 
in Belarus with a journalist arrested after his plane was forced to land in Minsk. 
Germany also slammed the interview with Roman Protasevich as a "disgrace", while British Foreign Secretary 
Dominic Raab said he was "clearly under duress". 
Speaking during a visit to Warsaw, Tikhanovskaya said: "All such videos are shot under pressure." 
"We should not believe any of the words of these people, including Roman Protasevich," said Tikhanovskaya, who 
ran against Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko in an election last year. 
"They are done after torture," she said, adding: "The task of political prisoners is to survive". 
Protasevich was arrested on May 23 along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega when their Ryanair flight from Athens to 
Vilnius was diverted, intercepted by a Belarusian fighter jet and made to land. 
The interview with Protasevich, the co-founder and former editor of opposition Telegram channel Nexta which 
galvanised anti-government demonstrations, was broadcast on Thursday. 
 Looking uncomfortable in the video, Protasevich said he had called for protests last year and praised Lukashenko. 
His supporters said he appeared to have marks on his wrists. 
At the end of the 1.5-hour interview broadcast by Belarus state-run channel ONT Thursday evening, Protasevich 
began crying and covered his face with his hands. 
The 26-year-old's father, Dmitry Protasevich, told AFP on Thursday that the video was the result of "abuse, torture 
and threats." 
"I know my son very well and I believe that he would never say such things," he told AFP. 
"They broke him and forced him to say what was needed," he said, adding it pained him to watch the interview. 
"I am very worried."

Raab called the interview with Protasevich "disturbing". 
"Those involved in the filming, coercion and direction of the interview must be held accountable," he said on Twitter.

In Germany, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said that Protasevich's supposed confession was "absolutely 
disgraceful and implausible". 
He accused Belarusian authorities of "mentally and possibly physically" pressuring him to speak. 
"That is a disgrace for the broadcaster showing (the interview) and for the Belarusian leadership which is once 
again showing its contempt for democracy and, it must be said, for humanity," Seibert said. 
Protasevich and Sapega are accused of helping to coordinate historic demonstrations that broke out following

In response to the arrests, the European Union banned Belarusian state carrier Belavia from operating flights to 
airports in the bloc and discouraged EU-based airlines from flying over the ex-Soviet country. 
But the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Friday called for the EU to review its recommendation for 
airlines to avoid flying over Belarus, saying that aviation "must not suffer from political interference". 
"Two wrongs do not make a right. Politics should never interfere with the safe operation of aircraft and politicians 
should never use aviation safety as a cover to pursue political or diplomatic agendas," IATA chief Willie Walsh said 
in a statement.

 European powers on Friday lined up to condemn a tearful interview shown on Belarusian state television with a 
dissident journalist who was arrested after his plane was diverted to Minsk, saying he was only speaking "under 
duress". 
Germany condemned the interview with Roman Protasevich as a "disgrace", while British Foreign Secretary 
Dominic Raab said it was "disturbing". 
Speaking during a visit to Warsaw, Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said: "All such videos are

galvanised anti-government demonstrations, was broadcast on Thursday. 
 Looking uncomfortable in the video, Protasevich said he had called for protests last year and praised Lukashenko. 
Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's Eastern Europe and Central Asia director, said in a statement that 
Protasevich had "visible wounds" on his wrists. 
She said the interview showed Protasevich to be "under intolerable psychological pressure" and constituted "ill-
treatment". 
"It was a televised coercion," she said. 
At the end of the 1.5-hour interview broadcast by Belarus state-run channel ONT Thursday evening, Protasevich 
began crying and covered his face with his hands.

Russian President Vladimir Putin -- a key supporter of Lukashenko -- meanwhile denied any Russian involvement in

"I don't even want to look into this, this has nothing to do with us," he said, speaking on Friday at the Saint 
Petersburg International Economic Forum. 
Putin also said he did not know who Protasevich was. 
"I don't know him and don't want to know him, let him do whatever he wants," he said. 
Protasevich was "clearly under duress" in the interview, Raab said on Twitter.

       U.K. stocks were moving lower in cautious trade on Friday as investors awaited U.S. non-farm payrolls data for 
May due later in the day for further clues on economic recovery and the upside risks to inflation.
 Amid increasing bets over possible tapering of stimulus, market participants also looked ahead to the Fed and the 
European Central Bank policy meetings next week for directional cues.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 dropped 15 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,049 after falling 0.6 percent the previous day.
 British Airways-owner IAG declined 1.5 percent, Wizz Air Holdings tumbled 3.4 percent and easyJet gave up 1.8 
percent as Britain added seven more countries to its "red list" of destinations that require hotel quarantine on return 
to England.

Europe and Britain from July onwards.
 AstraZeneca shares were little changed. The drug major has announced the appointment of Aradhana Sarin as an 
Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer.
 Mondi Plc., a packaging and paper company, shed half a percent. The company has signed a new 750 million 
euros 5-year revolving multicurrency credit facility agreement to refinance the existing 750 million euros facility that 
was due to mature in July 2022.
 In economic releases, the U.K. construction sector expanded for the fourth straight month in May to show the 
strongest output growth for just under seven years, according to survey results published by IHS Markit.

       European stocks were flat to slightly lower in cautious trade on Friday, as investors awaited U.S. non-farm 
payrolls data for May due later in the day for further clues on economic recovery and the upside risks to inflation.
 Amid increasing bets over possible tapering of stimulus, market participants also looked ahead to the Fed and the 
European Central Bank policy meetings next week for directional cues.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 was little changed with a negative bias at 450.70, but was on track to post half a 
percent gain for the week on hopes for economic recovery.
 The German DAX was marginally lower, France's CAC 40 index slipped 0.1 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was 
down 0.3 percent.

 Vivendi shares were down half a percent. Hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman's special-purpose acquisition 
company, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd. (PSTH), confirmed that it is in discussions with the French media 
giant to acquire 10 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of Universal Music Group B.V. or "UMG" for about $4 
billion, representing an enterprise value of 35 billion euros for UMG.
 Lanxess AG shares were little changed. The U.K's Competition and Markets Authority said that it is investigating 
the proposed acquisition of Emerald Kalama Chemical LLC by the German specialty chemicals company.
 In economic news, Eurostat data showed that Eurozone retail sales dropped 3.1 percent in April on a sequential 
basis, compared with the 1.0 percent decline expected by economists.
 Germany's construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 44.5 in May from 46.2 in the previous month, survey 
results from IHS Markit showed.
 This was the lowest reading since February, when the sector was impacted by a bout of severe wintry weather.
 The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply construction Purchasing Managers' Index for U.K. rose to 64.2 in

? Tech leads Wall Street lower with Facebook, Apple and Alphabet down ? German stocks end session at another 
record high ? Airline shares sell off as Portugal is removed from UK's quarantine-free list Global equities slid 
yesterday, led by US technology stocks, as investors grew increasingly worried about rising inflation.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent down by lunchtime in New York while the blue-chip S&P 500 
slid 0.2 per cent.
Big tech stocks including Facebook, Apple and Google parent company Alphabet were down more than 1 per cent 
by midday. Such growth stocks, which do not pay generous dividends and rely instead on rising valuations, appear 
less attractive to investors as prices climb.
The weakness on Wall Street came as global food prices surged by the biggest margin in a decade in May, 
according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization's monthly food price index.
Across the Atlantic, the region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark inched 0.1 per cent lower, ending two days of 
back-to-back record highs.
The CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.2 per cent while Frankfurt's Xetra Dax rose 0.2 per cent to close the session at another 
alltime high.
London's FTSE 100 dipped 0.6 per cent. Airline stocks also fell as the UK government announced that Portugal 
was no longer on its quarantine-free travel "green list".
The day in the markets What you need to know
Both International Airlines Group, the owner of BA, and easyJet sank more than 5 per cent while Ryanair fell 4.5 per 
cent.
Investors were also awaiting today's monthly US employment report and what implications it might have for the 
central bank.
"At the moment we've got emergency fiscal policies in place as the medical emergency is passing," said Roger Lee, 
head of UK equity strategy at Investec. "I think what the market is grappling with is how the Federal Reserve will 
deal with that."
On Tuesday, James Bullard, president of the St Louis Fed, said the US jobs market was tighter than it looks. The 
stronger labour market, coupled with rising signs of inflation, could mean the central bank will ultimately need to 
accelerate the timeframe for slowly pulling back on its bond-buying programme, investors have said.
Lee added that he would be paying close attention to the wage growth data today to see whether this current bout 
of inflation was structural or not.
"If you start to see that creeping up, then it becomes more difficult to argue that inflation is transitory," he said.

 The European Union on Friday banned[1] Belarus airlines from flying over EU territory or landing in its airports in 
response to the Belarus government's forced landing of a Ryanair plane to arrest journalist Raman Pratasevich. 
Driving the news: The restrictions come one day after Pratasevich appeared in a video[2] on Belarus state 
television declaring his respect for strongman Aleksandr Lukashenko — who he has opposed for years — and 
claiming to have organized "mass riots" against the regime. The 26-year-old breaks down in tears at one point in 
the video.Human rights groups pointed out bruises on the journalist's hands and face, suggesting that his 
confession was forced, the Washington Post reports[3]. The big picture: The diversion of the Ryanair passenger jet 
carrying Pratasevich last month prompted international outrage, after it was revealed that Belarus security services 
had called in a fake bomb threat to force the plane to land in Minsk and arrest him and his girlfriend. The U.S. last 
week condemned[4] Pratasevich's arrest and announced it was reimposing sanctions against nine state-owned 
Belarusian enterprises starting Thursday.The White House also stated it was working with the EU to develop 
specific sanctions against members of the Lukashenko regime. European leaders have described the incident as a 
"hijacking."

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union has slapped a ban on the overflight of the 27-nation bloc’s airspace and 
the use of its airports by Belarus airlines, in the wake of Minsk’s decision to divert a Ryanair passenger plane to 
arrest a dissident journalist last month.
EU headquarters said in a statement Friday that member countries will “be required to deny permission to land in, 
take off from or overfly their territories to any aircraft operated by Belarusian air carriers, including as a marketing 
carrier.”
Belarus’ international isolation has deepened since the May 23 incident, in which Belarusian flight controllers told 
the crew of a Ryanair jet of an alleged bomb threat. They also instructed them to land in Minsk, where journalist 
Raman Pratasevich was pulled off the plane by authorities.

 The International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Friday urged the European Aviation Safety Agency not to mix 
politics with safety, following the latter's decision to temporarily ban the use of the Belarusian airspace as a result of 
the incident with a Ryanair flight forcefully diverted to land in Minsk in May. 
"Aviation safety must never be politicized," Willie Walsh, IATA's director general said in a statement, calling the 
European Union regulator's decision a "retrograde and disappointing development."
IATA condemned the actions of the Belarus government, as well as calling for an independent investigation to be 
carried over, but at the same time urged EASA to rescind its prohibition.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) could turn down the delivery of Boeing's (BOE.L, BOEI.BR) first 737 MAX200 aircraft as 
it awaits confirmation, Reuters reported Thursday
Ryanair DAC Chief Executive Officer Eddie Wilson said that the airline requires a definitive delivery date as it does 
not receive new aircraft during the summer months. The company will take a final decision after Boeing confirms 
the delivery date.
Wilson added that the delays were related to certification by the US Federal Aviation Administration of the MAX200 
model, which contains an extra door for passengers.
Ryanair's shares plunged almost 5%, and Boeing fell over 2% on Thursday's close.

 The European bloc will also forbid EU aircraft from flying over Belarus. A wider sanctions package targeting 
Belarus is expected this month.The EU agreed Friday to ban Belarus-flagged carriers from the airspace and 
airports of the 27-nation bloc and will not permit EU airlines to fly over Belarus. 
The new civilian aviation ban is to sanction Belarus for diverting to Minsk a Ryanair flight that was traveling from 
Athens to Vilnius in order to arrest a prominent dissident blogger, Raman Pratasevich, and his girlfriend, Sofia 
Sepaga. 
An EU statement noted the extent of the ban on Belarusian aviation, requiring member countries "to deny 
permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories," and is set to come into effect at midnight Central 
European Time on Friday. Saturday is the first day the ban will be applied. 
EU ministers agreed last month to sanction the Belarus aviation sector over the May 23 incident. 
How have civil aviation bodies responded to the new rules? 
The European Union Aviation Safety Administration (EASA) said in a statement that while it understands the 
additional cost and effort to airlines, the ban is needed "to reduce the potential risk to passengers and crews that 
could arise from operations in this airspace." 
However, International Air Transport Association (IATA) chief Willie Walsh was critical of both Minsk and the EU for 
politicizing civilian air travel. IATA members include 290 airlines which account for more than four-fifths of air traffic 
internationally. 
"Two wrongs do not make a right," Walsh said, adding, "Politics should never interfere with the safe operation of 
aircraft and politicians should never use aviation safety as a cover to pursue political or diplomatic agendas."  
What further sanctions against Belarus are expected? 
EU diplomats are at work on an expanded blacklist. 
The new list is expected to include about 10 officials involved in diverting the airplane as well as dozens of others 
involved in the violent suppression of civil society since disputed elections last August. 
Key industries in Belarus such as fertilizer production will be targeted, as will Belarusian access to the bond market 
in Europe. The broader sanctions package could come into effect later this month. 
The EU has already hit 88 Belarusian officials with visa bans and asset freezes, including President Alexander 
Lukashenko who proclaimed himself the winner of the August presidential election, widely considered to be mired 
by fraud and deemed unfree by the international community. 
EU bans Belarus carriers from its airspace
Belarus faced further widespread condemnation from the international community Friday after state television aired 
a lengthy coerced confession by dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich on Wednesday evening where he was 
speaking under clear signs of duress.

Jun 04, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Council today (4 June) decided to strengthen the existing restrictive measures in relation to Belarus by 
introducing a ban on the overflight of EU airspace and on access to EU airports by Belarusian carriers of all kinds. 
EU member states will deny Belarusian air carriers (and marketing carriers who have a codeshare with a Belarusian 
carrier) permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories. 
Today's decision follows up on the European Council conclusions of 24 and 25 May 2021, in which EU heads of 
state and government strongly condemned the unlawful forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk on 23 May 2021 
endangering aviation safety. 
The downing of the Ryanair flight in Minsk was carried out with the express intent of detaining journalist Raman 
Pratasevich who has been critical of Lukashenko's regime and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. 
The Council is also assessing possible additional listings of persons and entities on the basis of the relevant 
sanctions framework, and further targeted economic sanctions.

 Roman Protasevich made preparations to protect his digital security before he was detained last month. But a 
friend said the young dissident did not predict that the Lukashenko regime would take such a drastic step. Franak 
Viačorka, a colleague of Protasevich, told Insider that his friend's "nightmare" was being captured by the KGB. See 
more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Weeks before Belarusian authorities diverted a passenger plane[2] to Minsk in order to arrest 26-year-old dissident 
Roman Protasevich[3], the young opposition blogger had discussed with a colleague the possibility that Belarus's 
authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko[4], might make a targeted strike against him. 
In the aftermath of Protasevich's arrest, Franak Viačorka, a senior advisor to exiled Belarusian opposition leader 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and a longtime colleague of Protasevich, told Insider that the two men had discussed 
potential scenarios and reactions to different events undertaken by their country's autocratic government. 
"We thought about security a lot," Viačorka said. "Especially digital security."  
As co-founder and editor-in-chief of NEXTA, a popular opposition Telegram channel based in Poland, Protasevich 
focused much of his work on leaking videos and documents from the Lukashenko regime. The team at NEXTA 
played a vital informational role during last year's highly contested presidential election[5] as Lukashenko's regime 
shuttered independent media organizations inside the country.  
When Belarusian security forces detained Protasevich on May 23 after the Ryanair flight he was traveling on from 
Greece to Lithuania was forced to land in Minsk, Viačorka said all of Protasevich's pages and accounts were 
deleted, thanks to prior digital security planning.  
"But we neglected the physical security," he said. "This flight, this was something we did not predict.  
Protasevich had been flying to Vilnius from Athens where he had been covering an economic forum before enjoying 
a brief vacation with his girlfriend, 23-year-old Sofia Sapega[6], who was also detained last month.  
Viačorka had been in Greece with Protasevich just days before, where he and his boss, Tikhanovskaya, who was 
forced into exile after running against Lukashenko in August's disputed elections, attended the same conference, at 
the invitation of Greece's government, he said.  
Colleague of detained Belarusian dissident said he and Roman Protasevich talked about digital security 
preparations prior to arrest but 'neglected' physical sec....
In fact, one week before Protasevich and Sapega's fateful Ryanair flight, Viačorka told Insider that he and 
Tikhanovskaya took the same flight from Athens to Vilnius.  
"So, perhaps, that was also a message to us," he said.  
When Viačorka saw the news that a plane had been forced to stop in Minsk on that Sunday in May, he said he was 
shocked. He believes he was one of the first people to know Protasevich was on the flight and the intended target 
of the aircraft's backtracking.  
"I waited until the very last moment to not publish this information, hoping that something will change, hoping that 
they will let him go or they will not land in Minsk," he said. 
In the hours and days that followed the abrupt diversion, passengers on the flight told reporters that Protasevich 
looked "shocked" and "scared"[7] following the pilot's announcement, even as the young activist instinctively began 
collecting his electronics to hand over to Sapega for safekeeping.  
Ryanair's CEO later said KGB agents[8] had been aboard the flight from the start. 
"I know Roman was scared. He was always afraid of being captured by KGB," Viačorka said. "It was his nightmare." 
In their conversations in the weeks leading up to Protasevich's capture, the two men discussed KGB methods and 
spy networks, Viačorka said.  
"Sometimes joking, sometimes seriously, we discussed these different situations," he said. "Perhaps, this is the only 
situation we did not predict." 
Protasevich now faces a possible death sentence[9] on charges of terrorism and inciting anti-government riots in 
Belarus - the last European country to employ the method.  
On Thursday, he appeared[10] on Belarusian state TV confessing to crimes against the country and praising his 
one-time foe, Lukashenko. Protasaevich's family, Belarusian opposition leaders, and members of the international 
community have decried the video, which has raised new concerns of torture and coercion. Read the original article

7 Stocks to Support Your New Year's Resolutions[2] After a year like 2020, many Americans figure that just getting 
to 2021 was enough. But for many people, the start of a new year still means making resolutions. And while many 
Americans are still waking up to Groundhog's Day, there is hope that things will look dramatically different in 
September than they do right now. 
 Some of the most popular resolutions include losing weight, exercising more, or taking steps to get our life and/or 
business more organized. And many pure-play companies lean into these trends and are doing well. 
 As an alternative to this, you can also invest in companies that are not pure plays but can still benefit from 
consumers looking to start fresh. Owning these stocks helps you manage your risk. If the trend holds, you can ride 
the wave. On the other hand, if the wave turns into a ripple, the stocks have other catalysts to get them through. 
 In this special presentation, we'll take a look at both of these categories. We've got several pure-play companies 
that let investors buy stocks in companies benefiting from these trends. We'll also give you a few stocks that fall in 
the latter category. 
 These are stocks that you might buy at any time and for many reasons. However, they present excellent buys as 
the new year begins.

 Belarusian authorities last month diverted a passenger flight in order to arrest a 26-year-old activist. The move 
shocked the international community, but experts said the step "falls within a certain pattern" for President 
Alexander Lukashenko. As the autocrat doubles down[1] in the aftermath, experts say international attention and 
action are more important than ever. Visit Insider's homepage for more stories[2]. 
The state-sanctioned diversion and detainment[3] of Belarusian dissident journalist Roman Protasevich[4] last 
month sparked outrage and reproach around the globe. But experts say the drastic move is emblematic of a larger, 
more nefarious problem in Eastern Europe: the ongoing corruption and abuses by Belarus's authoritarian president 
Alexander Lukashenko.[5]  
Often dubbed "Europe's last dictator," Lukashenko has been in power since 1994, enacting his autocratic rule for 
nearly as long. 
But in 2020, Belarus bore witness to a forceful wave of repression following a highly-contested August election, 
which prompted widespread protests throughout the country.  
Protasevich's detainment in May, though undeniably shocking, "falls within a certain pattern" for Lukashenko, who 
continues to pursue[6] a renewed crackdown against any and all critics, according to Rachel Denber, Deputy 
Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. 
In the days since the hijacking, Lukashenko has doubled down - issuing a travel ban[7] for most residents and 
releasing a suspect video[8] of a detained Protasevich praising the leader and confessing to crimes. 
Now, with all eyes on Belarus, experts say international action is more imperative than ever. A state-sanctioned 
hijacking captivates the globe On May 23, Belarusian authorities sent a fighter jet to divert a Ryanair plane flying 
from Athens, Greece, to Vilnius, Lithuania, citing a bogus bomb threat. The passenger plane backtracked, landing 
in Minsk, where police officers boarded the jet and arrested Protasevich, a 26-year-old journalist and activist, and 
his girlfriend Sofia Sapega[9], a 23-year-old Russian student.  
The 'shocking' arrest of a Belarusian dissident sparked international condemnation, but it falls into a 'pattern' of 
ongoing authoritarianism from Alexander Luk....
Passengers on Ryanair Flight 4978 told media outlets that the plane was "just minutes" from its destination in 
Lithuania when the pilot announced the aircraft would make an emergency landing in the Belarusian capital, after 
previously flying through the country's airspace.  
In the aftermath of the abrupt diversion, passengers on the flight told reporters that Protasevich looked "shocked" 
and "scared"[10] following the pilot's announcement, even as the young activist instinctively began collecting his 
electronics to hand over to Sapega for safekeeping.  
Ryanair's CEO later said KGB agents[11] had been aboard the flight from the start.  
Franak Viačorka, a senior advisor to exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and a longtime 
colleague of Protasevich, told Insider he knows his friend was scared.  
"He was always afraid of being captured by KGB, it was his nightmare," Viačorka said. 
The two men were together just before Protasevich's detainment, attending an economic conference in Greece, 
where Protasevich and Sapega also enjoyed a brief vacation. Weeks earlier, Viačorka said he and Protasevich had 
discussed the possibility of his capture and made plans for digital and electronic security. 
"But we neglected physical security," Viačorka said. "This was something we did not predict." An 'excessively 
paranoid' leader casts aside legality to apprehend a longtime adversary Belarusian state media[12] has reported 
that it was Lukashenko, himself, who gave the "unequivocal order" to ground the plane in Minsk - an audacious act 
by a powerful man driven by the notion that his enemies are out to get him, according to Denber. 
"I think it shows that he wanted to send a message that 'we will find you no matter where you are,'" Denber said. 
"No one is safe."  
Viačorka likened Lukashenko's brazen display of power to an "alpha man" wanting to prove to the world he is in 
control. 
Lukashenko's moves in the days since seem to confirm Viačorka's characterization of the aging autocrat. On May 
24, Belarusian authorities posted videos of both Protasevich[13] and Sapega[14] confessing to crimes against the 
country.  
Opposition leaders and Protasevich's own father said the videos were made under duress[15], and what appeared 
to be an injury on Protasevich's face sparked concerns of torture. 
Then, on Thursday, the young dissident appeared[16] on Belarusian state TV confessing to organizing "mass 
unrest" and praising his one-time foe. 
"I realized that many things [Lukashenko] is criticized for are just attempts to pressure him, and that in many 
moments he acted like...a man with balls of steel," Protasevich says in the video. 
Ten days after his arrest, the staunch Lukashenko opponent was suddenly praising the autocrat's regime. 
Protasevich, who began his activism at 16, had been detained several times before during his time freelancing for 
opposition news outlets before moving to Poland after he was forces out of university. As co-founder and editor-in-
chief of NEXTA, an opposition Telegram channel, he focused much of his work on leaking videos and documents 
from the Lukashenko regime.  
In 2019, he was drawn back to Belarus, eager to impact real change in Minsk. But Lukashenko's authoritarian grasp 
was tightening on the country ahead of the 2020 elections, and anticipating impending danger, Protasevich fled to 
Warsaw for a second time. 
Protasevich and his allies continued their journalism at NEXTA leading up to the presidential election, playing a vital 
informational role as Lukashenko's regime shuttered independent media organizations inside the country.  
But amid mass protests following the country's highly contested 2020 election, Protasevich's journalism evolved into 
political activism as he began organizing protests against the Belarusian government through NEXTA, which had 
become the most popular opposition platform in Belarus.  
"We're journalists, but we also have to do something else," Protasevich told The New York Times[17] in September. 
"No one else is left. The opposition leaders are in prison." Belarus has suffered years of election-cycle repression 
under Lukashenko's regime For nearly three decades, Lukashenko has ruled Belarus with a tight grip reminiscent of 
the country's Soviet past. But he wasn't always an oppositional figure. 
"It's important to remember that [Lukashenko] was quite popular when he was elected in 1994," Denber said. 
In the aftermath of the Soviet Union's fall, economic despair and widespread corruption reigned throughout the 
region, casting a tremendous uncertainty over Belarus. Lukashenko offered an appealing message and solution, 
Denber said. He wanted to stabilize the economy, fight corruption, and provide economic and national stability for 
the people. 
The 'shocking' arrest of a Belarusian dissident sparked international condemnation, but it falls into a 'pattern' of 
ongoing authoritarianism from Alexander Luk....
"But his autocratic...intent to erode democratic freedom and to very brusquely cast aside human rights emerged 
very quickly," Denber said.  
By 1996, Lukashenko had already introduced constitutional reforms that strengthened his presidency to the 
detriment of other government branches and had begun going after his political opponents. By the end of the '90s, 
Denber said several of Lukashenko's political adversaries had disappeared, some presumed murdered.  
Thus began a decades-long cycle of election-era repressions targeting independent journalists, human rights 
defenders, and political protesters. Several election cycles in the aughts sparked protests, Denber said, which in 
turn, would lead to fierce government crackdowns against civil society.  
"There were a lot of pretty dark years," she said.  
After a particularly grim period from 2010 to 2012, Lukashenko's repression eventually gave way to a slight 
"loosening up," Denber said. By 2019, Belarus had released almost all of its political prisoners, and the European 
Union and the United States both dropped formerly-imposed sanctions against the country. 
As the 2020 elections approached, Denber said the government promised a commitment to free and fair elections - 
it was the first time in years an opposition candidate would be allowed to run a real campaign.  
But the August elections proved to be an inflection point of massive consequence for Protasevich, Lukashenko, and 
the future of Belarus. A 'highly contested' election and a 'catastrophic' crackdown As campaigning for the landmark 
election began, it was clear Lukashenko was far from ready to acquiesce power. Leading opposition candidates 
found themselves arrested, oftentimes on bogus charges, while other candidates were simply refused the 
opportunity to register. 
Sergei Tikhanovsky, a well-known blogger faced both a refusal to register his nomination and a short prison 
sentence for organizing unauthorized protests. So, his wife Svetlana Tikhanovskaya decided to run in his place.  
"She was able to campaign fairly unimpeded," Denber said. "Nobody expected she would draw the crowd she 
drew." 
Her popularity grew among Belarusians in the spring and early summer. In June, Tikhanovskaya received an 
anonymous phone call threatening her children's life unless she dropped out. She sent her children out of Belarus 
but stayed in the race.  
On August 9, the Central Election Commission, which is controlled by Lukashenko's government, announced that 
the incumbent president had won a sixth term, crediting him with 80% of the vote. Tikhanovskaya's team objected, 
claiming to have won at least 60% in a first-round victory and calling on Lukashenko to begin negotiations. 
"It's hard to know what percentage of the vote she actually got, but clearly more than anyone expected," Denber 
said. 
Negotiations never came. Instead, the government arrested two members of her campaign's Coordination Council 
and offered the others a false choice: Leave the country or else.  
"We are dealing with a man who is getting...politically older," Viačorka, Tikhanovskaya's senior advisor said about 
Lukashenko. "Last year he became anxious, nervous, and absolutely irrational." 
During the height of the election outcry in September, Protasevich left Poland to join Tikhanovskaya in Lithuania, 
cementing himself even further as Lukashenko's enemy.  
In Belarus, the disputed election set off a mass wave of unprecedented, mostly peaceful protests. Viačorka 
estimated the movement was one of the biggest progressive movements in Europe in the past 40 years.  
But the civil demonstrations drew Lukashenko's ire. The government dismantled what independent media was left, 
targeting and arresting journalists throughout the country; officials restricted internet access for hours in August as 
protests surged; and security forces detained thousands of people, subjecting hundreds to torture, Human Rights 
Watch[18] reported at the end of 2020.  
"There are so many people in prison right now," Denber said in May. "Literally hundreds in jail connected to the 
protest movement."  
Viačorka believes thousands are still detained. Experts hope last month's aviation incident will spur international 
attention and action Lukashenko's post-elections crackdown stoked anger among ordinary Belarusians, making him 
even more unpopular throughout the country and prompting dissidents to look for new forms of resistance, Viačorka 
said. 
But it was last month's incident - Protasevich and Sapega's detainment - that captured the world's attention.  
"Last year's oppression was eye-opening for Belarusians...that was a wake-up call for Belarusians," Viačorka said. 
"Sunday was a wake-up call for the world." 
The 'shocking' arrest of a Belarusian dissident sparked international condemnation, but it falls into a 'pattern' of 
ongoing authoritarianism from Alexander Luk....
Denber agreed, saying she hoped the hijacking would "shock people to read into what else is happening" in the 
European country, including the death of a dissident in prison[19] and the arrest of additional journalists[20] since 
Protasevich's arrest. 
The US responded to what some countries called a "state-sanctioned hijacking"[21] with fierce statements of 
condemnation and a re-imposition of full-blocking sanctions[22] against Belarusian enterprises and a handful of key 
members in the regime. The EU prepared its own package of sanctions[23] targeting the country's national airline 
and top aviation officials, as well as the Belarusian economy. 
All 27 members of the EU also agreed to bar[24] European airlines from flying through Belarusian airspace and 
block Belarus's national airline from flying through or landing in the EU.  
But the EU may be in a bind moving forward. As the West moves to isolate Belarus even further, the closer it 
pushes Lukashenko to Vladimir Putin, his complicated, on-again-off-again Russian ally[25]. 
Many top officials believe it was Putin who gave Belarus the green light to divert the Ryanair flight.[26] 
But Tikhanovskaya and Viačorka are pressing international allies to think beyond last month's incident. On 
Tuesday, the opposition leader called for more US sanctions[27], imploring the country to take further action against 
enterprises and individuals supporting the Lukashenko regime. 
"Sanctions should help to stop the violence and help release all of political prisoners," she said after meeting with 
senators from the US Foreign Relations Committee. 
Viačorka and the opposition who remain free will continue to put pressure on the regime, fighting for new, free 
elections and democratic reforms, he said. He's also compelling Western politicians to help. 
"I urge Americans and Europeans, be braver, be strong," he told Insider. "The regime is the problem and if you 
don't want North Korea in the the center of Europe, try to do everything to shut it down, please." 
As for Protasevich, his future remains uncertain. Last week, his mother begged[28] the US and EU to help free her 
son, who faces charges of terrorism and inciting anti-government riots.  
On Wednesday, Lukashenko intimated[29] that Protasevich may face the death penalty for his "crimes" in Belarus - 
the last country in Europe to employ the practice.  
But Viačorka knows that his friend is only one prisoner in an ongoing war. 
"It's not about Roman. We don't want to trade for Roman only," he said. "He will be released only when all prisoners 
will be released." Read the original article on Business Insider[30]

 Have European Union restrictions on travelers from the U.S., Britain and some other major nations become 
politicized? The chief executive of Wizz Air, the Budapest-based low-cost airline, thinks so. 
'I think the European Union as such has broken down completely," József Vradi told CNBC this week. "We have 
failed to come up with unified measures and an orchestrated approach dealing with the situation, and it has become 
incredibly overpoliticized.' 
He's not alone in expressing frustration. Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, a rival Dublin-headquartered 
discount airline, has urged politicians to recognize 'it's time that we got on with our lives.' Ryanair last month posted 
the biggest annual loss in the company's 35-year history, because of COVID-19 travel restrictions and lockdowns 
wiping out air traffic. This turned the company's previous year's $1.24 billion profit into a $990 million loss in the 12 
months to March 31. 
The EU decision Thursday to urge member states to maintain a prohibition on tourists and other nonessential 
travelers from the U.S. and Britain, among other non-EU countries, has left many in Europe's commercial aviation 
and hospitality sectors fuming about what they view as the laggardly pace of easing travel restrictions for tourists.

06/AP21153430493530.jpg?itok=gz3gZ6NH European Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas speaks 
during a media conference at EU headquarters in Brussels, June 2, 2021. The European Union unveiled 
Wednesday plans to revamp Europe's ID-check free travel area. Lack of uniformity 
They say the European Commission is being overcautious, and they also are impatient with the lack of uniformity 
among member states about reopening their countries to tourists this Northern Hemisphere summer. Most national 
governments have been implementing the EC's tight travel recommendations, but others in the past few weeks 
have not, further complicating journeys into the bloc from outside, especially for those unable to take direct flights to 
their destinations. 
Frustration Greets EU Decision to Keep Travel Restrictions on US, UK
Some member states have also been imposing curbs on travel from other EU countries, turning the bloc and the 
once borderless Schengen Area into a complicated puzzle of rules and requirements. 
Italy, Portugal and Greece, member states of the Schengen Area, and Croatia, an EU member, have all been 
ignoring Brussels and have been cautiously opening their tourist-dependent countries to travelers, including from 
the U.S. and Britain, which have vaccinated more of their populations than the EU. Italy started to ease travel 
restrictions on Americans and Britons in mid-May, although quarantines often still apply. Americans can travel on 
COVID-19-safe flights to Italy, which require multiple coronavirus tests. 
American and British travelers are crucial for the European tourist industry. Americans made more than 36 million 
trips to Europe in 2019. The total number of tourist visits by U.K. residents to the European Union reached 67 
million the same year. 
EC keeps a list 
The EC has a 'white list' of countries with low infection rates comprising Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, 
Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Travelers from those countries, regardless of their reasons for journeys, are 
welcome, as far as the EC is concerned. Japan was added to the list at midweek. China also is on the white list, 
subject to reciprocity by the Chinese government. 
The 27 EU member states have been debating for months ways to make travel easier, both within the bloc and from 
outside, and the EC has recommended all member states starting July 1 lift restrictions on travelers who were fully 
vaccinated at least 14 days before their arrival in the EU.

06/AP21119359269403.jpg?itok=9u2M7TA6 FILE - German police check arriving passengers for a negative 
coronavirus test in Frankfurt, March 30, 2021. The European Commission proposed April 29 issuing 'Digital Green 
Certificates' to EU residents to facilitate travel in the bloc by summer. By July 1, the EU's Digital COVID-19 
certificate is meant to be up and running across the bloc, allowing border authorities to verify the coronavirus status 
of travelers — whether they have been vaccinated, had a recent negative test or have proof of recovery from 
coronavirus infection. Seven countries, including tourist-dependent Greece and Croatia, already have started rolling 
out so-called vaccine passports much earlier than planned. 
'Europeans should enjoy a safe and relaxing summer," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said 
Monday. "As vaccination progresses, we propose to gradually ease travel measures in a coordinated way with our 
common tool: the EU Digital COVID Certificate.' 
But some in Europe's travel industry have doubts that everything will go smoothly next month, even when many 
restrictions are due to be eased. Olivier Jankovec, director-general of Airports Council International Europe, a trade 
association, worries there will be a lack of consistency in travel rules across the bloc and says the EC and national 
governments don't understand how challenging reopening will be for airports and airlines. Jankovec says the EU 
and member states are underestimating what will happen when tourism does pick up. 
Airport 'chaos' feared 
'The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind-blowing for now," Jankovec said 
in a statement. "With each passing day, the prospect of travelers enduring widespread chaos at airports this 
summer is becoming more real. We urgently need governments to step up planning on the full range of issues 
involved — and work more closely with airports and airlines.'

06/AP21119359310073.jpg?itok=PFYUxiwi FILE - Travelers, wearing face masks to prevent the spread of the 
coronavirus, walk along the departure hall of the Zaventem international airport in Brussels, Jan. 22, 2021. His trade 
association has warned that air passengers risk spending hours at airports in July and August because of multiple 
and diverse COVID-19 checks. 
Some British lawmakers have expressed suspicions the EU has not added Britain to the white list because of post-
Brexit political grievances. Last month, Brussels eased its COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people criteria from 25 to 
75 and Britain meets the EU target. But EU officials say they are concerned about an increase in infections in 
Britain from a more transmissible coronavirus variant first discovered in India, hence the decision to exclude the 
U.K. 
The Biden administration has not yet lifted a ban on travelers wishing to visit the United States from the 27 
European Union member states and the United Kingdom, but officials have indicated that could soon change. 
Meanwhile, Britain also has faced criticism from southern European countries for failing to include them on its 
meager 'green list' of safe-for-travel countries. Portugal's foreign ministry said it couldn't 'understand the logic' of 
Britain's midweek switch of Portugal from green to amber. 
The move means any Britons who travel to Portugal will have to take two tests upon their return and self-isolate at 
home for 10 days, which will deter tourists. 'Portugal is continuing its easing of its lockdown, prudently and 
gradually, with clear rules for the safety of those who reside here or visit us,' Portugal's foreign ministry tweeted 
Thursday. 
British officials, like their EU counterparts, say they are guided in their decision by the scientific advice they are 
receiving. The U.S. has not lifted its restrictions on travel from Europe for non-U.S. citizens or residents, but officials 
in Washington have told VOA that is under review.

 The European bloc will also forbid EU aircraft from flying over Belarus. A wider sanctions package targeting 
Belarus is expected this month.The EU agreed Friday to ban Belarus-flagged carriers from the airspace and 
airports of the 27-nation bloc and will not permit EU airlines to fly over Belarus. 
The new civilian aviation ban is to sanction Belarus for diverting to Minsk a Ryanair flight that was traveling from 
Athens to Vilnius in order to arrest a prominent dissident blogger, Raman Pratasevich, and his girlfriend, Sofia 
Sepaga. 
An EU statement noted the extent of the ban on Belarusian aviation, requiring member countries "to deny 
permission to land in, take off from or overfly their territories," and is set to come into effect at midnight Central 
European Time on Friday. Saturday is the first day the ban will be applied. 
EU ministers agreed last month to sanction the Belarus aviation sector over the May 23 incident. 
How have civil aviation bodies responded to the new rules? 
The European Union Aviation Safety Administration (EASA) said in a statement that while it understands the 
additional cost and effort to airlines, the ban is needed "to reduce the potential risk to passengers and crews that 
could arise from operations in this airspace." 
However, International Air Transport Association (IATA) chief Willie Walsh was critical of both Minsk and the EU for 
politicizing civilian air travel. IATA members include 290 airlines which account for more than four-fifths of air traffic 
internationally. 
"Two wrongs do not make a right," Walsh said, adding, "Politics should never interfere with the safe operation of 
aircraft and politicians should never use aviation safety as a cover to pursue political or diplomatic agendas."  
What further sanctions against Belarus are expected? 
EU diplomats are at work on an expanded blacklist. 
The new list is expected to include about 10 officials involved in diverting the airplane as well as dozens of others 
involved in the violent suppression of civil society since disputed elections last August. 
Key industries in Belarus such as fertilizer production will be targeted, as will Belarusian access to the bond market 
in Europe. The broader sanctions package could come into effect later this month. 
The EU has already hit 88 Belarusian officials with visa bans and asset freezes, including President Alexander 
Lukashenko who proclaimed himself the winner of the August presidential election, widely considered to be mired 
by fraud and deemed unfree by the international community. 
EU bans Belarus carriers from its airspace
Belarus faced further widespread condemnation from the international community Friday after state television aired 
a lengthy coerced confession by dissident journalist Raman Pratasevich on Wednesday evening where he was 
speaking under clear signs of duress.

 Belarusian state TV aired an interview in which Roman Protasevich praised President Lukashenko. Protasevich's 
father said this showed Belarus had "broken" his son and forced his actions. Dmitry Protasevich said: "I know my 
son very well and I believe that he would never say such things." See more stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
The father of Roman Protasevich, the Belarusian dissident who was detained after authorities diverted his flight, 
has said that the country had "broken" his son by forcing him to confess and praise its authoritarian president[2] on 
video. 
The Belarusian state TV channel ONT published a 90-minute-long interview on Thursday, which showed 
Protasevich appearing to praise President Alexander Lukashenko, whom Protasevich had long criticized. -Matthew 
Luxmoore (@mjluxmoore) June 3, 2021[3] "I realized that many things Aleksandr Grigoryevich [Lukashenko] is 
criticised for are just attempts to pressure him, and that in many moments he acted like a man with balls of steel," 
Protasevich said, according to Matthew Luxmoore, RFERL's Moscow correspondent. 
Protasevich went on to say that he regretted on calling on Belarusians to organize against the government and 
distanced himself from the country's opposition leader. 
In a Thursday interview with Agence France-Presse[4] after the state TV interview was aired, Protasevich's father 
Dmitry said: "I know my son very well and I believe that he would never say such things." 
"They broke him and forced him to say what was needed," he said. 
Protasevich is a co-founder of the NEXTA Telegram channel, the most popular opposition platform in Belarus. 
Roman Protasevich was seized by Belarusian authorities on May 23 after the country diverted his Lithuania-bound 
Ryanair flight. The dissident had been living in Poland in 2019 over fears for his security. 
Dmitry Protasevich said[5] last month that he believed Roman was being forced to admit guilt in an earlier video 
Belarusian authorities released of him, and that Roman appeared to be beaten up. Read the original article on

 A diverted plane is nothing new, bomb threats may be rare but are no longer a novelty, but an armed interceptor 
fighter jet 'escorting' an airliner to an unexpected destination in another country is very different. Now step forward, 
or rather, fly forward, to Ryanair flight 4978, which was traveling from Athens to Vilnius on May 23, when it was 
forced to land in Belarus. 
 First, can we put the fallacy of a potential bomb threat to one side? This was a politically motivated act and 
intended to capture an irritant to the Belarusian regime. After all, state security police do not suddenly turn up just to 
'escort' an individual off a plane. 
 What we should do is put this issue in perspective in regards to what is changing around our continent, especially 
involving politics but also the greater economy of the region as well as that of individual nations. 
 Globally, authoritarianism seems to have been successful in terms of wielding power, and the acquiescence of the 
populations affected has for the most part been remarkable. One notable and worthy exception to this has been the 
continued presence of demonstrators in Minsk and key areas of Belarus, who have stood up very bravely against 
well-armed police and the Belarusian KGB. 
 Obviously, the power of the Russian leader has had a significant influence, where the sham of democracy has 
increasingly been exposed. The paranoia that Russian leaders have had over the centuries about foreign 
interference is still well-entrenched in the country's political class and intelligence services. This is to a certain 
extent understandable given the historical track record of foreign invasion and interference in Russia, from the 
Mongol-Tatars to the Poles, to Napoleon and post-October Revolution military interventions, and of course World 
War II. The Russians quite rightly highlight their pain, efforts and losses to the outside world. 
 Today we see Russia taking advantage of a hopelessly weak and vacillating European leadership to extend its 
influence, not just in Europe, but on a more international scale, especially in the Middle East.

Now let's add in Ukraine, in a chronic state, both politically and economically, where Putin has again called 
Europe's bluff over the theft of the Crimea and the support for the separatists in two eastern Ukrainian regions. 
Their calls for support have achieved little and any action has been either by indirect support, denunciations or 
marginal sanctions. They merely provide Vladimir Putin with an opportunity for a wry smile. 
European weakness and the rise of authoritarians
 Now with the arrival of the energy pipeline Nord Stream-2, Russia plays another card by providing direct fuel to 
Germany alongside unreliable statements about operational independence. Please wake up Chancellor Merkel: 
there is a large bear sitting on your gas tap. This is a tap that can be turned off at a time of tension and there have 
been clear precedents in the past. Germany has been blessed with possibly the strongest and most successful 
democratic leader it could have in the form of Angela Merkel, but as her extended term in office draws to a close, 
there seems no one of similar stature to take her place. 
 Then we have another EU power and that is France. Marine Le Pen seems to have rebuilt her position and power 
to such an extent that another democratic assault on the Elysee is almost certainly on the cards. Again this is not 
necessarily because this fervent right-winger is particularly able, but because democratic leaders are seen as being 
weak and ineffectual.  
 A similar story can be told both in Poland and Hungary where phrases along the lines of 'I didn't swap domination 
by Moscow and the old Soviet Communist Party to be controlled and dictated to by Brussels bureaucrats' are not 
unknown. 
 Another element to this tawdry tale was Brexit, opted for by just over half of the UK voting population. This too was 
a vote won by the populists and has, as was fairly predictable, created some difficult disturbances on both sides of 
the Channel. For the EU there is obviously a significant disruption in its budget, with one of the largest contributors 
pulling out, but also despite the frequent arguments, a reduction in political strength with such a powerful nation 
leaving. 
 Equally, though, for the British, there is the slow realization that the national economy will be poorer at least in the 
short term. Trading issues through delays, new systems and bureaucracy have already had a negative impact (both 
in ports such as Dover, but more importantly across the Irish border) and now the shortage of labor is being felt 
directly from farm produce not being harvested swiftly enough, through to the hospitality industry.  
 This was obviously severely affected by the economic lockdowns and the furlough schemes, so as yet we cannot 
judge just how many people will be returning to those jobs, but the strong indication is that a significant reduction in 
the workforce from mainland European countries is having quite a dramatic effect on cafes and restaurants which 
are fully opening up. 
 By casting our eyes over Europe, we can see the broader effect that these political changes are having. The main 
issue in my view is that of confidence, as that is the key driver for investment and expansion. The seeming 
destabilization over the past few years caused by authoritarians over vacillating democracies will have an effect. 
Europe needs to have a clear post-pandemic plan to re-energize its economies both inside and outside the 
European Union. 
 This means some clear and effective leadership from the democracies, which at present seems hard to find. 
Democracy is a precious commodity that is hard to win. It can easily be lost whether through indifference or just 
pompous complacency. Europe has created astonishing wealth for itself after the disasters of the two 20th-century 
world wars and the decades of Communist rule in the continent's eastern half, but this economic strength must not 
be dissipated by political ignorance or, dare I say it, stupidity. 
 I believe we have a great opportunity for some very exciting development, but it is going to take some great 
political vision, leadership and action to push back the nay-sayers and enthuse our populations for a brighter and 
stronger economic future.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
To convey a positive image of Belarus and promote a pro-government Telegram channel, the 'Belarus - the country 
for life' YouTube channel uses forced confessions of political prisoners as paid advertisements. 
Main findings: 
 ABelarus focused YouTube channel[2]has videos with up to hundreds of thousands of views.The 
engagement,number of subscribers and view count[3]suggest paid boosting.The ads had hyperlinks to apro-
government Telegram channel[4].Thevideos attack the opposition[5]and praise the regime, which violates human 
rights.Boosting the videos would cost tens of thousands of euros, on top of production costs.The videos used as 
advertising go againstYouTube standards[6]on ads. 
 It all started with an alarming tweet.Tadeusz Giczan[7], the editor-in-Chief of Belarus's largest Telegram channel 
NEXTA_TV, wrote that confession videos of people captured by the Belarusian state are used as paid ads on 
YouTube to advertise pro-government Telegram channels. 
The man on the video screenshot isRaman Pratasevich[8]after being arrested on 23 May 2021, following theforced 
diversion of a RyanAir flight[9]from Athens to Vilnius to Minsk airport. 
Pratasevich has worked as a photographer and journalist and currently is the editor-in-chief of the opposition 
Telegram channels 'Nexta[10]' and 'Nexta Live[11]'. After the rigged presidential election in 2020, these channels 
collected and published videos of mass protests, making the content accessible across the whole world. Now 
The Dirty Side Of Advertising: Forced Confessions From Belarus On Youtube
Pratasevich'sforced confession[12], titled 'The terrorist confessed everything',seems to be used[13]to advertise pro-
government Telegram channelYellow plums[14](@zheltyeslivy). 
It's also important to bear in mind that this isnot the first time[15]such forced confession videos have been released. 
The channel 
The channel spreading the videos is called Беларусь - страна для жизни or 'Belarus - the country for life'. It is 
worth noting that the official promotionalvideo[16]of Belarus (also visibleon YouTube[17]) from 2015 bears the same 
name. 
Another link to the Belarusian regime is apparent in the channel'schoice of logo[18], as it resembles theBelarusian 
presidential flag[19]. 
The channel's'About' section does not reveal[20]who is behind it. The only publicly available information shows that 
it has 1390 subscribers, and the view count exceeds a whopping 6 million. 
Last, but not least, the channel was created on 5 August 2020. On the very same day, a video was uploaded, 
showing illegitimate president Alyaksandr Lukashenka delivering a speech. After the presidential elections on 9 
August, the videos showed violentprotesters[21]with a question: 'Is this peaceful?'. Another clipbashed the 
opposition[22]. 
The spread 
To see how manypeople noticed[23]this promoted campaign, we ran a Googlesearch[24]using the Channel ID 
code. We found thatthe videos uploaded[25]by the channel and thenpromoted as advertisements[26], were shared 
in multiple Telegram channels. We alsofound a post[27]describing how previously users saw advertisements of 
shampoo and English courses, but afterwards were targeted with pro-government video clips. The user also 
wondered why YouTube's moderators allowed such ads to run. 
We also found a Telegrammessage[28]with a screenshot of theforced confession video[29]of Raman Pratasevich's 
partner, Sofia Sapegaused as an advert[30]. The video is covered with a Russian language watermark saying 
Yellow Plums, the advertisement has a hyperlink to theYellow Plums Telegram[31]channel and the very same 
channel had also published the same confession video. 
The comments below the screenshot discuss how propagandists use the state budget for such advertisements and 
draw some historic parallels. 
The cost and videos 
As there is no publicly available information on who the ads targeted, we tried to find out how much it would cost the 
channel to run such ads if they only focused on an audience in Belarus. Thus, we mimicked the process of creating 
a YouTube advertisement to obtain the suggested cost per view (CPV). We found that a view in Belarus costs 0.01 
euro. 
As for what counts as a view, Google Ads defines it as a user interacting with the ad, watching it entirely or for at 
least 30 seconds. It's important to bear in mind that YouTube does not publicly share information about how many 
of the views were a result of paid promotion. 
The Dirty Side Of Advertising: Forced Confessions From Belarus On Youtube
The videos 
According to the information above and the publicly visible 139,000 views on the Raman Pratasevich'svideo[32], the 
promotion cost should be at least 1390 euros. But that's only the minimum sum. As stated above, YouTube only 
counts a view if a user watches the video for at least 30 seconds but charges the channel owner 0.01 euros every 
time a user saw at least 4 seconds of the clip. 
As for the entire channel, by June 2, it had 55 videos. The most popular video features rapper Seryoga who claims 
there isabsolute peace and order in Belarus[33]and that the infrastructure is working. The clip has 672,000 views, 4 
shares and 12 likes on Facebook and according to media analysis tool BuzzSumo it is an advertisement. 
The channel also has multiple videos about Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. One of them is 
a12 second compilation[34]of different clips that make her say 'Spring is close and we know that those guilty for 
violence against Belarusians Me, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, my team, my representatives will go to jail and it's not 
an exaggeration.' The description of the video is simple: 'Это конец Света' or 'This is the end, Sveta'. The video 
has 196,000 views. 
On the other side of the spectrum, we can find a two minute video showingillegitimate Belarusian 
president[35]Alyaksandr Lukashenka giving a speech, protesters harassing the police and some smiling babies. 
The video description says it'spowerful, bright in emotions and constructive[36]and it has 171,000 views. 
The numbers 
The total view count of the channel is 6,279,000. If this is divided between all the 55 videos uploaded, the result is a 
whopping 114,164 views on average. 
When the same approach is applied to the YouTube channel of theBelarusian Information Agency BelTA[37], the 
result is, on average, 7,909 views per video. 
Moreover, a YouTube channel with only 1390 subscribers should normally receive fewer than 1000 views on non-
promoted content (point proven byeight videos with less than 1000 views[38]). The numbers above and below show 
that the content was either viral or there were more videos used as adverts. The latter would mean that someone is 
paying YouTube tens of thousands of euros to attack the critics of the Belarusian regime, advertise a pro-
government Telegram channel, show that everything is in order in Belarus and that the president is a trustworthy 
person. 
Out of the 55 videos uploaded by the channel, BuzzSumo was able to gather information about 14. While it labelled 
only two of them as advertisements, some of the others (namely theforced confession[39]of Pratasevich) fell very 
close to the threshold BuzzSumo uses to detect an advert. Note that while Sofia Sapega's video has 193,600 
views, it has no shares, likes or comments on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit or Pinterest. 
The Telegram and YouTube channels 
Returning to the Tweet ofTadeusz Giczan[40]and the question of what kind of role theBelarusian Information 
Agency BelTA[41]plays in using Raman Pratasevich's video topromote pro-government[42]Telegram[43]channel 
Yellow Plums, we can only rely on netizensdiscussing[44]the matter and sharing screenshots of ads with hyperlinks 
to the channel visible. 
Thus, on the surface, theYellow Plums Telegram[45]channel is not linked to BelTA. However, the channel regularly 
posts exclusive material and personal data that only the special services have access to. It also posts a ton of 
inhumane, highly toxic content, not just propaganda per se. 
The Dirty Side Of Advertising: Forced Confessions From Belarus On Youtube
YouTube has said that it hasremoved the forced confession ads[46]. But the damage has already been done, the 
videos of Raman Pratasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega have already received 139,000 and 191,000 views 
respectively. While the ads have been stopped, the videos are still there, amongst others, some of which portray 
the opposition as criminals and the government as its victim. And by doing so, the owners of the channel seem able 
to avoidYouTube's Community Guidelines[47]that regulate what is not allowed on the platform. 
For some, these videos might be a stark reminder of how their country treats independent media. For others, they 
are a reminder of an authoritarian regime using taxpayers money and the internet to lie and manipulate their 
citizens. And for some, these videos are just advertising worth 0.01 euros per view. Times five, maybe six million? 
And that's just one channel. 
* Update: on the evening of June 3, the channel uploadedyet another video of Raman Pratasevich[48], this time 
titled: 'Pratasevich: I respect Lukashenka!'. In the video he confesses toorganising mass unrest and regrets urging 
people[49]to protest.

 The European Union announced Friday it is banning all flights from Belarus from flying over EU airspace and 
denying them access to all EU airports. 
In a statement, EU officials said all EU member states will be required to deny permission to land in, take off from or 
overfly their territories to any aircraft operated by Belarusian air carriers, including as a marketing carrier. The ban 
will take effect at midnight Friday, Central European Time.

05/AP21144533390557.jpg?itok=pukZX9BF FILE - In this handout photo released by European Radio for Belarus, 
Belarus journalist Raman Pratasevich poses for a photo in front of euroradio.fm sign in Minsk, Belarus, Nov. 17, 
2019. The move comes in response to the May 23 incident in which Belarus scrambled a fighter jet to order the 
forced landing of an Irish Ryanair commercial airliner that was traversing Belarusian airspace en route to Lithuainia. 
Belarus officials took opposition journalist Raman Pratasevich off the plane and have held him ever since. 
The regional air traffic agency Eurocontrol reports about 400 civilian planes usually take routes over Belarus. 
Several European airlines including Lufthansa, SAS and Air France have already announced they would stop flying 
over its airspace. 
Pratasevich appeared on Belarus state television Thursday, tearfully confessing to his role in anti-government 
protest in an interview that the opposition said was made under duress. 
In the interview, Pratasevich admitted to plotting to topple President Alexander Lukashenko by organizing "riots" 
and recanted earlier criticism of the veteran leader. 
Lukashenko's office did not immediately respond to accusations of coercion.

Airlines hit as Portugal loses green list status
Airlines hit as Portugal loses green list status

Airline shares slid after a report that Portugal had lost its UK green list status while there would be no new additions 
to the places people can visit quarantine-free.
Analysts said that if confirmed the removal of Portugal would be a major blow to European-focused airlines such as 
EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) and Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA).
British Airways owner IAG (LON:IAG), meanwhile, had been pleading with the government to include the US on the 
green list to reboot its lucrative business travel routes.
According to the BBC, however, Portugal will be downgraded to amber removing the one big UK tourist destination 
free from quarantine.
Holiday travel, in theory, resumed on 17 May but Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand were the only other 
major holiday places on the green list and the Antipodean countries aren't allowing UK visitors.
Southern Europe in July and August is a key holiday destination for the British and rather than further restrictions 
the airlines had been calling for a reduction in requirements such as PCR tests for places such as Spain and 
Greece. 
If it is confirmed as amber-rated, visitors returning from Portugal will have to quarantine for ten days and take a 
Covid-19 test on days 2 and 8.
Airlines hit as Portugal loses green list status
Spain, France, Italy and the United States are on the amber list but the reports today suggested more countries will 
be added to the red list, meaning anyone coming back to the UK will have to stay in a hotel and quarantine for 
almost two weeks.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had warned that he would not hesitate to downgrade countries if that was the advice.
"I want you to know we will have no hesitation in moving countries from the green list to the amber list to the red list 
if we have to do so. The priority is to continue the vaccine rollout, to protect the people of this country," he told 
reporters.

A possibility of Portugal being removed from the UK's green list later of safe places to visit today unsettled airlines.
Several countries are expected to be added in the review, including the Canary Islands, Malta and Finland, with 
some Greek and Caribbean locations also possible additions.
Others, including countries in Asia such as Vietnam and Malaysia, might be downgraded to either an amber or red 
rating.
Portugal is also at risk due to a rise in the number of infections recently.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today that he would have "no hesitation" in reclassifying countries if the 
assessment of risk by the Joint Biosecurity Centre changes.
"We're going to try to allow people to travel, as I know that many people want to, but we've got to be cautious and 
we've got to continue to put countries on the red list, on the amber list, when that is necessary.
Visitors to an amber-rated country have to quarantine for ten days on their return and take tests after two and eight 
days while those returning from red-rated countries have to quarantine in a hotel for two weeks.
Airline operators have been pleading for the government to relax restrictions surrounding air travel and changes to 
the status of a destination such as Portugal where holidays have resumed would be a major setback.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair PLC's (LON:RYA) chief executive said yesterday that it was absolutely imperative that big 
tourist destinations are added to the green list.
Portugal green list removal talk unsettles airlines
"The restrictions should be lifted, we should be allowing British families to travel to the US and Europe, and also to 
return without having to complete useless PCR forms for people who've already been vaccinated," he told Sky 
News.
IAG, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, has also called for the US to be granted green list status given the 
importance of business travel.
Luis Gallego, IAG's chief executive, said the US should be on the UK's green list of countries due to its high rate of 
vaccinations.
Labour has already called for the traffic light system to be scrapped altogether due to the confusion.
A reported 300,000 people have travelled on holiday to amber-rated countries such as Greece and Spain even 
though official advice to visit only if it is essential.
Shares in IAG slipped to 3% to 203.4p, Ryanair 2% to (EURO)16.82 and Easyjet 2.3% to 987p.

The European Union is likely to ramp up pressure on Belarus by formally banning state-owned carrier Belavia (B2, 
Minsk National) from any operations within the bloc, as well as placing travel bans and asset freezes on a number 
of aviation industry officials, Reuters has reported. Ambassadors from all 27 member states are likely to agree on 
the extent of the sanctions by the end of the current week, sources said. Their decision will then be formalised at a 
meeting of the bloc's foreign ministers later this month. According to the sources, the sanctions could affect 
Belarus's top defence and transport ministry officials, air force personnel, a top Minsk National airport official, and a 
senior civil aviation official. 
The sanctions are also expected to ban from the EU another state-owned aviation industry enterprise, although the 
sources did not reveal its identity. The only other active state-owned airline in Belarus is cargo specialist 
Transaviaexport Airlines (TXC, Minsk National), the ch-aviation PRO airlines module shows. It is not clear if the 
asset freezes or other sanctions, other than the overflight ban, would impact Belavia directly. The flag carrier has 
extensive dealings with EU-based lessors, including four E175s and three E195s dry-leased from Denmark's Nordic 
Aviation Capital, one B737-300, two B737-500s, and three E195-E2s dry-leased from Ireland's AerCap, and one 
B737-800 each dry-leased from Ireland's SMBC Aviation Capital, Thunderbolt Aircraft Lease, and WNG Capital, the 
ch-aviation fleets ownership module shows. The sanctions are expected to be a stop-gap measure until EU 
politicians agree on how to punish Belarus's more vital industrial sectors including its potash/fertiliser industry 
wherein the country controls 20% of the global market. The sanctions are linked to the May 23 forced diversion of a 
Ryanair B737-800, flying from Athens Int'l to Vilnius, by the Belarusian authorities. Upon landing at Minsk airport, an 
opposition journalist along with his girlfriend were detained and arrested before the aircraft was allowed to depart 
with a seven-hour delay. The European Council, the institution which comprises all EU heads of states and 
governments, adopted conclusions recommending the banning of Belavia a day after the incident. However, the 
body's decisions are non-binding and need to be implemented into EU law by other bodies, including the Council of 
the European Union, which comprises ministers responsible for a particular policy area. So far, a number of EU 
countries have implemented unilateral bans on Belavia, including all of Belarus's EU neighbours (Latvia, Lithuania, 
and Poland), as well as non-EU Ukraine, leaving Russia as the only neighbouring state which continues to accept 
the Belarusian state carrier's flights. Left with no easy access route even to those European countries that still 
permit its operations, Belavia has said it will reorient its network towards more destinations in Russia. Following the 
recent meeting, Presidents Vladimir Putin and Aleksandr Lukashenko instructed their respective transport ministries 
to explore new route opportunities between the countries including the possible launch of flights from Belarus to 
Russian-occupied Crimea. Since Russia's unilateral annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, no foreign 
EU to formally sanction Belavia , officials
carriers have started flights to Simferopol given a lack of recognition for Russian sovereignty over the region. Kyiv 
has even begun sanctioning Russian airlines that serve the region without its largely moot consent. According to 
Reuters, Lukashenko, who refused to recognise Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, has now said 
that Minsk is working with Moscow over the start of flights to Crimea from Belarus.

Belarus incident threatens aviation's culture of safety
Belarus incident threatens aviation's culture of safety

T he diversion of Ryanair flight 4978 by Belarusian air traffic control on the apparently spurious grounds of a bomb 
threat last week prompted an unusually rapid response from the international community.
Airlines have been advised not to fly over Belarus, the national carrier has been banned from EU airspace, and 
sanctions on the Belarusian elite are being drawn up.
Belarus is believed to have fabricated a bomb threat in order to arrest a political dissident. This may not be the first 
time a state has forced the landing of a jet for political purposes, but it is the first time that many in the industry can 
recall of civil air traffic control being weaponised - used by a state to pass a false message to a commercial airliner 
to force it to land.
Now that the way has been shown, others may follow.
It might be assumed that Belarus has broken international aviation law. But the first article of the Convention on 
International Civil Aviation, which sets the framework for safe and effective civil flight, says "every State has 
complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory".
That opening clause is the sine qua non that enables an international system of civil aviation to exist. Yet it is also 
the greatest weakness in ensuring the integrity of global aviation, as the incident with Ryanair showed.
Belarus incident threatens aviation's culture of safety
Jim Bell, co-head of aviation at law firm Watson Farley & Williams, says: "If the state decides there is good cause to 
ask an aircraft to land, it can do so with impunity."
Belarus's actions contradict the spirit of the convention, and the precedent could have serious repercussions for the 
aviation industry. These go well beyond the need to avoid flying over Belarus, which will add cost in fuel and 
emissions.
Pilots have to be able to trust what they are being told by controllers. If they have to second-guess the motives 
behind what they are being asked to do - and in particular, in a situation such as a bomb threat - it adds to already 
complex procedures and will jeopardise safety.
Flight restrictions and possible may not be stop others the path of
The International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations says: "This unprecedented act of unlawful interference 
will potentially upend all the assumptions about the safest response to bomb threats on flight and interceptions."
There is no obvious remedy. The ideal solution would be to create an independently managed international system 
for air navigation service provision. That might not have stopped Belarus from falsifying a bomb threat and passing 
it on to flight 4978. But normal procedure in the event of a bomb threat is to land at the nearest airport.
An independent air navigation service provider would have directed the aircraft to Vilnius, 72km away by the time 
the pilot decided to land, instead of Minsk, 183km distant. At the very least, the young dissident and his partner 
would still be free.
Yet after decades of trying, the EU struggles to get member states to implement measures that fall short of that 
independent ideal.
The Single European Sky initiative was launched about two decades ago to reduce fragmentation of European 
airspace and improve performance of air traffic management. A few weeks ago, Willie Walsh, head of the aviation 
industry trade body, Iata, warned that the initiative was on the brink of collapse due to "the intransigence and 
selfishness of key EU states and their air navigation service providers".
Most countries are not willing to cede their sovereign right to manage their airspace, even with caveats to ensure 
the military's freedom of action in cases of threat or conflict.
The EU acted with alacrity in cracking down on Belarus's actions. But flight restrictions and possible sanctions may 
not be enough to stop others from following suit. It would be far better if the system were designed to make such 
actions more difficult.
Brussels has been developing an external aviation policy, replacing member states' bilateral agreements with third 
countries. These EU agreements deal with safety, security and competition. Perhaps they could also be used as 
leverage in an attempt to reform the way air navigation services are operated.

T he diversion of Ryanair flight 4978 by Belarusian air traffic control on the apparently spurious grounds of a bomb 
threat last week prompted an unusually rapid response from the international community.
Airlines have been advised not to fly over Belarus, the national carrier has been banned from EU airspace, and 
sanctions on the Belarusian elite are being drawn up.
Belarus is believed to have fabricated a bomb threat in order to arrest a political dissident. This may not be the first 
time a state has forced the landing of a jet for political purposes, but it is the first time that many in the industry can 
recall of civil air traffic control being weaponised - used by a state to pass a false message to a commercial airliner 
to force it to land.
Now that the way has been shown, others may follow.
It might be assumed that Belarus has broken international aviation law. But the first article of the Convention on 
International Civil Aviation, which sets the framework for safe and effective civil flight, says "every State has 
complete and exclusive sovereignty over the airspace above its territory".
That opening clause is the sine qua non that enables an international system of civil aviation to exist. Yet it is also 
the greatest weakness in ensuring the integrity of global aviation, as the incident with Ryanair showed.
Belarus incident threatens aviation's culture of safety
Jim Bell, co-head of aviation at law firm Watson Farley & Williams, says: "If the state decides there is good cause to 
ask an aircraft to land, it can do so with impunity."
Belarus's actions contradict the spirit of the convention, and the precedent could have serious repercussions for the 
aviation industry. These go well beyond the need to avoid flying over Belarus, which will add cost in fuel and 
emissions.
Pilots have to be able to trust what they are being told by controllers. If they have to second-guess the motives 
behind what they are being asked to do - and in particular, in a situation such as a bomb threat - it adds to already 
complex procedures and will jeopardise safety.
Flight restrictions and possible may not be stop others the path of
The International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations says: "This unprecedented act of unlawful interference 
will potentially upend all the assumptions about the safest response to bomb threats on flight and interceptions."
There is no obvious remedy. The ideal solution would be to create an independently managed international system 
for air navigation service provision. That might not have stopped Belarus from falsifying a bomb threat and passing 
it on to flight 4978. But normal procedure in the event of a bomb threat is to land at the nearest airport.
An independent air navigation service provider would have directed the aircraft to Vilnius, 72km away by the time 
the pilot decided to land, instead of Minsk, 183km distant. At the very least, the young dissident and his partner 
would still be free.
Yet after decades of trying, the EU struggles to get member states to implement measures that fall short of that 
independent ideal.
The Single European Sky initiative was launched about two decades ago to reduce fragmentation of European 
airspace and improve performance of air traffic management. A few weeks ago, Willie Walsh, head of the aviation 
industry trade body, Iata, warned that the initiative was on the brink of collapse due to "the intransigence and 
selfishness of key EU states and their air navigation service providers".
Most countries are not willing to cede their sovereign right to manage their airspace, even with caveats to ensure 
the military's freedom of action in cases of threat or conflict.
The EU acted with alacrity in cracking down on Belarus's actions. But flight restrictions and possible sanctions may 
not be enough to stop others from following suit. It would be far better if the system were designed to make such 
actions more difficult.
Brussels has been developing an external aviation policy, replacing member states' bilateral agreements with third 
countries. These EU agreements deal with safety, security and competition. Perhaps they could also be used as 
leverage in an attempt to reform the way air navigation services are operated.

Wizz buckles up for lingering Covid losses Airlines

Wizz Air has warned that it expects to lose money over the next year unless travel restrictions disappear rapidly, in 
a sign of the threat to the aviation industry from the lingering effects of the pandemic.
The low-cost carrier said yesterday that restrictions had stayed in place "longer than anticipated", and it expected to 
fly 30 per cent of its normal schedule between April and June.
Unless there was an "accelerated and permanent lifting of restrictions", the London-listed Wizz forecast a net loss 
for the 12 months to the end of March next year.
After that, Jozsef Varadi, chief executive, expected a return to profit and to operate a full schedule.
"We are cautiously optimistic about the recovery of the business, which has started later than what we would have 
liked," said Varadi. "The outcome [of this financial year] could be in a wide range depending on restrictions," and it 
could end up a "great" year if flying resumed quickly. Mark Simpson, an aviation analyst at Goodbody, said the 
airline's view was "realistic but cautious given the current level of restrictions on travel ... across Europe".
Wizz's forecasts are marginally gloomier than those of Ryanair, its European low-cost rival, which expects to break 
even over the next 12 months.
Varadi said there was clear pent-up demand for travel when restrictions are lifted. "Consumers are very willing to 
come back and are coming back. The moment they can fly, they are going to."
Wizz buckles up for lingering Covid losses Airlines
But the "uncoordinated" reopening of European borders made it difficult to project how much flying would be 
possible over the coming months.
The Hungarian airline reported a net loss of (EURO)482m in the 12 months to the end of March, after passenger 
numbers fell 75 per cent to 10m.
European airlines are hoping for restrictions to be lifted in time for a strong European summer, when they 
traditionally do most of their flying and earn the bulk of their revenue.
Wizz is better placed than most, with (EURO)1.6bn in cash at the end of March and a cash burn averaging 
(EURO)61m a month over the past year. The carrier has one of the strongest balance sheets in the European 
industry.
Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein, said there were "encouraging signs for the reopening" in Wizz's results, 
including improving booking trends.
The airline is expected to emerge as a long-term winner from the crisis thanks to its low cost base and expansion 
into new regions over the past year as rivals have retreated.
Like Ryanair, Wizz has taken delivery of new aircraft during the pandemic, and both carriers hope that the more 
fuel-efficient aircraft will cement their cost advantage over other airlines. See Bryce Elder

 The journalist, arrested aboard a Ryanair flight, said in the video on state TV that staging protests now would be 
pointless, urging the opposition to wait for a more opportune moment.A dissident journalist arrested when Belarus 
diverted his flight appeared again in a video broadcast by Belarusian state media late Wednesday. 
Raman Pratasevich had admitted to charges of organizing protests in a video aired last week. 
Belarusian opposition said the 26-year-old journalist was pressured to appear in the confession video. His parents, 
who now live in Poland, said the confession seemed to be coerced. Nevertheless, the state-controlled ONT channel 
aired another sit-down with the captive activist late on Wednesday.  
What did Pratasevich say? 
In his latest appearance, Pratasevich said he saw no point in protesting in Belarus against President Alexander 
Lukashenko at the moment, saying that the movement has lost impetus. 
Instead, he argued, the opposition should wait until economic problems trigger broad public discontent. 
"We need to wait until the economic situation worsens... and people take to the street for a mug of soup, to put it 
bluntly,'' he said.  
Pratasevich also said that an unidentified associate had set him up. He explained that he had put a notice about his 
travel plans in a chat with associates some 40 minutes before his departure.  
He speculated that someone with whom he had a personal conflict could have issued the bomb threat, which 
Belarusian officials at the time claimed as the reason why they forced the flight to land in Minsk.  
"The first thing I thought was that I have been set up,'' Pratasevich said. 
Ties to the opposition? 
Pratasevich accused the unidentified associate of having links with opposition hackers who had previously attacked 
Belarusian official websites and issued bomb threats. 
According to the Associated Press, Pratasevich had noted last month that he had a rift with Franak Viachorka, an 
adviser to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 
Commenting on the video, Viachorka told AP that Pratasevich's comments should be disregarded because he is 
now "a hostage under pressure," insisting the two had friendly ties. 
There was no immediate response from Tsikhanouskaya. 
Why is Pratasevich detained?  
Pratasevich has become a top foe of Lukashenko as he ran a widely popular channel on the Telegram messaging 
app that played a major role in helping organize the massive anti-government demonstrations.  
Belarus : Raman Pratasevich appears in another prison video
He was charged with inciting mass disturbances and could face up to a 15-year prison sentence. 
Last week, Lukashenko laccused Pratasevich of fomenting a "bloody rebellion." 
Belarus had forced a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk on May 23, citing a bomb threat. 
Belarusian security forces arrested Pratasevich and his girlfriend, triggering outrage. 
The European Union demanded his immediate release and imposed sanctions on Belarus.

Jun 03, 2021( EU Reporter: http://www.eureporter.co Delivered by Newstex)  
 The European Union is preparing sanctions on Belarus' national airline and around a dozen top Belarusian aviation 
officials, three diplomats said, a stop-gap measure before economic sanctions following the forced landing of a 
passenger plane, writes Robin Emmott. 
The proposed asset freezes and travel bans are part of a package of new sanctions on Belarus from EU states, 
which are outraged that a Ryanair flight was pressed to land in Minsk on 23 May to arrest a dissident journalist and 
his girlfriend. 
EU governments, which described the incident as state piracy, say they are looking at targeting sectors that play a 
central role in the Belarus economy, to inflict real punishment on President Alexander Lukashenko. They could 
include bond sales, the oil sector and potash, a big Belarusian export. 
Before imposing such economic sanctions, the bloc is expected to agree by June 21 - when EU foreign ministers 
meet - a smaller sanctions list on individuals and two entities as a quick, intermediary response, the diplomats said. 
"All EU states agree with this approach," one diplomat said. A second diplomat said there would be "a clear signal 
for Lukashenko that his actions were dangerous and unacceptable". 
While the sanctions are still under discussion, EU ambassadors as early as Friday could pre-approve banning 
overflights and landing in EU territory by Belarus airlines, allowing EU ministers to formally sign off on them later in 
the month. 
Britain, no longer part of the EU, has suspended the air permit for Belarus' national carrier, Belavia. The EU is 
expected to do the same, the diplomats said. 
The names are expected to include top Belarus' defence and transport ministry officials, military from the airforce, a 
top Minsk airport official and a senior civil aviation official, the diplomats said. 
EU to blacklist Belarus airline ahead of economic sanctions, diplomats say
Also to be blacklisted and banned from business with the EU is another state-owned enterprise from the aviation 
sector. 
More details were not immediately available. The EU does not comment publicly on ongoing preparations for 
sanctions. 
Lukashenko said last week the journalist pulled off the plane had been plotting a rebellion, and he accused the 
West of waging a hybrid war against him. Read more[1] 
Since cracking down on pro-democracy protests last year, he has withstood three previous rounds of EU sanctions 
and comparable U.S. measures - mainly blacklists that bar officials from travelling to or doing business in Europe 
and the United States. 
EU foreign ministers said last week that fresh sanctions would include a fourth round of travel bans and asset 
freezes linked to a disputed presidential election in Belarus last August. The around a dozen names are separate 
and directly linked to the Ryanair incident.

 Ryanair (RYA.L, RY4C.IR) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary urged the government to add tourist 
destinations including the US and Europe to the green travel list by the end of the week, Sky News reported 
Wednesday.
O'Leary noted that the travel restrictions and requirements of completing "useless PCR forms" should be lifted for 
people vaccinated against COVID-19.
"It's time that we got on with our lives. We've had 18 months of the scientists and the doctors worrying us about 
scariants and variants and all the rest of it," O'Leary said.
The budget airline's shares were up marginally on Wednesday's close.

High Hopes For He Airlines Come Down To Earth 
'High hopes that brighter skies were in sight for the airlines[4] have been brought back down to earth with a bump 
after the UK government brought in even stricter controls on key holiday routes. Far from beaming the green light 
on to more destinations, Portugal has been taken off the list, as infection rates increase in the country. Caution is 
the name of the game for the British government, but it's a hand dealt as a bitter blow to the travel industry. Shares 
in British Airways owner IAG and EasyJet fell by more than 5% by mid-afternoon as the realisation dawned on 
investors that another summer washout could be on the way. Travel operator TUI which had also been counting on 
a rebound in bookings fell by 4%, while Ryanair and Wizz Air dropped by around 3%. As aircraft stay grounded, 
cash burn is likely to intensify eating into the financial buffers the airlines have built up through debt restructuring 
and rights issues. The situation is also being seen as a drag on the fortunes of Rolls Royce, the aircraft engine 
manufacturer and supplier of maintenance for jets, as recovery in its commercial business retreats a little further on 
the horizon. There is still a glimmer of hope that swift vaccination[5] roll outs will make way for a late summer revival 
in fortunes, but the travel industry is now going to have to play an even bigger game of catch up.''

 A man said to be a Belarusian activist allegedly behind the setting up of a social media of a political opposition 
reportedly stabbed himself in court according to a rights group and opposition media. The man was identified as 
Stepan Latypov who collapsed on Tuesday when he appeared to use a pen to stab himself in the neck. 
Latypov was taken to a hospital after the incident [1]but is reportedly in satisfactory condition. He is being accused 
of setting up the social media of the opposition and resisting arrest last September. The 41-year-old has denied the 
charges as President Alexander Lukashenko ramps up his drive to crack down on the opposition linked to the 
controversial election victory in August. 
The incident happened as the father of the accused was given a witness testimony in court, the rights group Viasna 
[2]narrated. Further to their report, Latypov had allegedly informed his father that law enforcement representatives 
had threatened to punish him if he did not admit his guilt. Aside from that, criminal punishment against his relatives 
and neighbors was promised. 
"Belarusian activist, political prisoner Stsiapan Latypau cut his throat in the courtroom today. He was threatened 
with the persecution of his family if he didn't admit himself guilty,' Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a Belarusian opposition 
leader said on Twitter. "This is the result of state terror, repressions, torture in Belarus. We must stop it 
immediately!" 
The incident comes not long after Belarus banned citizens from leaving the country as well as foreigners with 
residency permits. The State Border Committee has tightened rules following international outrage[3] over Belarus's 
recent diversion of a Ryanair flight and arrest of a top dissident along with his girlfriend. 
Tikhanovskaya insists that she won the election and has moved to Lithuania since most of the dissidents fled 
Belarus after the disputed election.

Belarus : Raman Pratasevich appears in another prison video

 The journalist, arrested aboard a Ryanair flight, said in the video on state TV that staging protests now would be 
pointless, urging the opposition to wait for a more opportune moment.A dissident journalist arrested when Belarus 
diverted his flight appeared again in a video broadcast by Belarusian state media late Wednesday. 
Raman Pratasevich had admitted to charges of organizing protests in a video aired last week. 
Belarusian opposition said the 26-year-old journalist was pressured to appear in the confession video. His parents, 
who now live in Poland, said the confession seemed to be coerced. Nevertheless, the state-controlled ONT channel 
aired another sit-down with the captive activist late on Wednesday.  
What did Pratasevich say? 
In his latest appearance, Pratasevich said he saw no point in protesting in Belarus against President Alexander 
Lukashenko at the moment, saying that the movement has lost impetus. 
Instead, he argued, the opposition should wait until economic problems trigger broad public discontent. 
"We need to wait until the economic situation worsens... and people take to the street for a mug of soup, to put it 
bluntly,'' he said.  
Pratasevich also said that an unidentified associate had set him up. He explained that he had put a notice about his 
travel plans in a chat with associates some 40 minutes before his departure.  
He speculated that someone with whom he had a personal conflict could have issued the bomb threat, which 
Belarusian officials at the time claimed as the reason why they forced the flight to land in Minsk.  
"The first thing I thought was that I have been set up,'' Pratasevich said. 
Ties to the opposition? 
Pratasevich accused the unidentified associate of having links with opposition hackers who had previously attacked 
Belarusian official websites and issued bomb threats. 
According to the Associated Press, Pratasevich had noted last month that he had a rift with Franak Viachorka, an 
adviser to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 
Commenting on the video, Viachorka told AP that Pratasevich's comments should be disregarded because he is 
now "a hostage under pressure," insisting the two had friendly ties. 
There was no immediate response from Tsikhanouskaya. 
Why is Pratasevich detained?  
Pratasevich has become a top foe of Lukashenko as he ran a widely popular channel on the Telegram messaging 
app that played a major role in helping organize the massive anti-government demonstrations.  
Belarus : Raman Pratasevich appears in another prison video
He was charged with inciting mass disturbances and could face up to a 15-year prison sentence. 
Last week, Lukashenko laccused Pratasevich of fomenting a "bloody rebellion." 
Belarus had forced a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania to land in Minsk on May 23, citing a bomb threat. 
Belarusian security forces arrested Pratasevich and his girlfriend, triggering outrage. 
The European Union demanded his immediate release and imposed sanctions on Belarus.

 By EU vs Disinfo[1] 
This week saw the continuation of pro-Kremlin disinformation efforts to justify the forced diversion and landing of a 
Ryanair flight in Minsk, in order to detain a Belarusian dissident, journalist Raman Pratasevich. 
In a manner similar to disinformation campaigns following the poisoning and arrest of Russian opposition 
politicianAlexey Navalny[2], pro-Kremlin outlets started to claim that this blatant act ofstate-sponsored piracy[3]was 
in fact aprovocationagainst Belarusand that Westernsecret services[4]were involved in it. 
According to the Lithuanian edition of Sputnik, Western secret servicesleaked information about Pratasevich's 
journey[5]to Minsk, as a pretext to ban Belarusian flights over the EU. The Spanish edition of the same outlet 
alleges that the goal of 'Ryanairgate' was tosabotage the Minsk Agreements[6], whereas in Armenia, Sputnik claims 
that Pratasevich simply became aburden[7]on his Western handlers and was abandoned. Abandoned, to 
provokesanctions against Belarus.[8] 
Such messages, although hardly convincing, have several purposes. Firstly, they present the perpetrators as 
victims, aiming to obscure the link between the actions of Belarusian (Russian) authorities and 
theirconsequences[9]for the country. Secondly, presenting Raman Pratasevich (Alexey Navalny) as a tool of 
Western secret services takes away their agency - opposing increasingly authoritarian regimes is thus never a 
matter of individual will, but rather a sinister Western plot. And finally, many different claims, even if mutually 
exclusive and perpetuating some wild conspiracy theories, also serve as a smoke-screen to create confusion about 
what actually happened. We saw such disinformation tactics applied to other difficult-to-defend acts, for instance 
the recent Russianmilitary build-up[10]near Ukraine. 
The World Of Hate: How The Pro-Kremlin Media Continue To Justify The Forced Diversion Of A Ryanair Flight
 On double standards 
 This week, both the pro-Kremlin and Belarusian state-controlled media found one more way to defend the 
embattled Alyaksandr Lukashenka - by blaming the West for alleged 'double standards'. 
The catalyst for this kind of narrative was the unscheduled landing of a Ryanair flight from Dublin to Krakow in 
Berlin on 30 May 2021 due to apossible security threat on board[11]. 
The next morning, the spokesperson of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked, onFacebook[12], why NATO 
did not make a statement and why nobody demanded an international investigation. 
The answer is obvious for anyone outside of the pro-Kremlin disinformation circle: unlike a week earlier, the 
diversion of the flight was not forced, and when no actual danger on the plane was detected,allof the passengers 
continued their journey. 
But the false equivalence was not going to stop the disinformers. The incident was broadly covered on Belarusian 
state-controlled TV, generously sharing the position of the spokesperson of the Russian MFA, and with Belarusian 
politicians alleging that this was the most obvious case of 'double standards[13]'. 
Such a claim is a continuation of a disinformation mantra we observedlast week:[14]it not just that 'everybody does 
it[15]', but, supposedly, it also happens 'all the time[16]'. 
 Denigration of Raman Pratasevich continues 
 In a similar manner, the denigration of Raman Pratasevich continues. The pro-Kremlin media consistently portray 
him not just as a 'bad guy', but a 'very bad guy' - anextremist[17]and amercenary[18], suspected ofgenocide and 
terror[19], having fought alongside 'neo-Nazis[20]' in Ukraine. 
There is no evidence for any of these claims, as the investigation by independent outletMeduza [21]shows, nor are 
they in any way relevant to the case. But for pro-Kremlin outlets, such messages help to kill two birds with one 
stone: not only to discredit the jailed Belarusian dissident, but also to perpetuate the narrative of 'Nazi Ukraine[22]'. 
 The World of Hate 
 The pro-Kremlin disinformation about the forced diversion and landing of a civilian plane the and subsequent arrest 
of a Belarusian journalist aims not only to defend the illegitimate president of Belarus. 
Notably, covering the meeting between the Russian and Belarusian presidents in Sochi, the pro-Kremlin media did 
not have to resort to disinformation,stating[23]that: 
'for Belarus, Russia is now the only neighbour where its planes can fly. This Sochi meeting is to be like no other as 
Belarus has found itself in the deepest crisis with the West ever'. 
No need to lie, the job here is done. 
Nonetheless, focusing on Belarus and international reactions to its actions allows pro-Kremlin spin-doctors to paint 
the world as full of 'double standards' and hate directed at Russia and its friends. In the words of a Russian TV 
hostDmitry Kiselyov[24], currently under EU sanctions: 
'The hatred towards Russia and Belarus, and we are in the same boat here, can be explained by the fact that we 
don't give in to the Western madness - America and Europe - who have abandoned the way of their traditional 
The World Of Hate: How The Pro-Kremlin Media Continue To Justify The Forced Diversion Of A Ryanair Flight
culture, from gay parades and sex-change operations to destroying the monuments of founding fathers and 
admiring Nazism in Ukraine. We are different and in this sense, we are aliens to the West'. 
The world of disinformation indeed is a dark and alienating one.

 Detained blogger Roman Protasevich praised Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko on state TV Thursday. The 
26-year-old faces terrorism charges after he was pulled off a diverted Ryanair flight forced to land in Minsk. 
Protasevich's parents have previously said they believe their son is being tortured and forced to confess. See more 
stories on Insider's business page[1]. 
Journalist and activist Roman Protasevich appeared[2] on Belarusian state TV on Thursday to praise Belarus' 
authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, and confess to organizing "mass unrest." 
The confession interview comes 10 days after Protasevich was removed from a Ryanair flight when the plane was 
forced to land in Minsk. -Matthew Luxmoore (@mjluxmoore) June 3, 2021[3] "I realized that many things 
[Lukashenko] is criticized for are just attempts to pressure him, and that in many moments he acted like...a  man 
with balls of steel," Protasevich says in the video. 
Protasevich potentially faces the death penalty for charges of terrorism and inciting anti-government riots. Read the

 On Monday Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced decisions reached in a meeting with top military 
officials which mark a continued significant escalation with NATO. The Associated Press described of his 
statements[3], "He pointed to a growing number of flights by U.S. strategic bombers near Russia's borders, 
deployments of NATO warships and increasingly frequent and massive drills by alliance forces." 
 "The US and NATO continue to expand the scope of operational and combat training near our borders," the 
Russian defense minister explained. "The actions of our Western counterparts are destroying the security system in 
the world and forcing us to take adequate countermeasures. We are constantly improving the combat composition 
of the troops."  
 And that's when he proposed a specific military response includingthe formation of 20 new units to be permanently 
based in the Western Military District. "By the end of the year, about 20 formations and military units will be formed 
in the Western Military District," Shoigu said.  
  
 This will no doubt be taken as a deeply threatening move in the West, given it's precisely the expanded Russian 
military war drills and additional troop build-up along Ukraine's border which sparked the latest crisis and sanctions 
tit-for-tat of late March and which reached its height in April. But it bears reminding that the Russian military is 
merely talking about troop positionswithin its own sovereign borders- though apparently this remains hugely 
"threatening" for the West.  
Russia Forming 20 New Military Units To 'Counter NATO' Near Western Border
 Presumably the 20 new military units for the purpose of 'countering NATO' will be able to react even more swiftly to 
any escalating crisis in Crimea or Donbas.AP notes of Defense MinisterShoigu's statements:"He added the military 
units in Western Russia have commissioned about 2,000 new pieces of weaponry this year."  
 Interestingly Belarus and its longtime ruling strongmanAlexander Lukashenko are also increasingly front and center 
in terms of the Russia-NATO standoff and Eastern European and Baltic fault line, particularly after the recent 
Ryanair plane diversion and detention of anti-Lukashekno activist Roman Protasevich.  
 Shoigu also announced[4]planned-for major joint Russia-Belarusian military exercises to take place in upcoming 
months. "Preparations for Zapad-2021 joint strategic Russian-Belarusian exercise, which will take place in 
September at the training grounds of Belarus and the Western Military District, have entered an active phase. A 
number of command post exercises have already been carried out with the involvement of headquarters of various 
levels," he said.  
 Sergei Shoigu with Vladimir Putin, via Wiki Commons 
  
 However,Shoigu noted its "exclusively defense character" - no doubt wary of growing accusations from the US and 
its allies of the Kremlin's supposed 'expansionist' ambitions.  
 "I want to emphasize that the Zapad-2021 exercise is planned. It is carried out by decision of the presidents of 
Russia and Belarus and is exclusively defensive in nature," he said."Within the time frame established by 
international treaties, our partners will be informed about the parameters of the exercise, and the event itself will be 
able to be visited by international observers and journalists."

Here we go again in the latest tit-for-tat escalation following the May 23rd forced diversion of the Ryanair flight 
carrying anti-Lukashenko activist and journalistRoman Pratasevich by Belarus, who was subsequently arrested 
when the plane landed in Minsk: Russia and Germany have just denied each others' airlines permission for 
incoming flights. 
 AFP is confirming[3] that 'Germany has blocked flights operated by Russian airlines from arriving in its territory in 
tit-for-tat action after Moscow failed to provide authorizations for Lufthansa, the transport ministry said Wednesday, 
amid tensions over Belarus.' 
 https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/lufthansafile.jpg?itok=eL7pU8HL 
Days ago Moscow had begun blocking European carriers which were actively avoiding Belarusian airspace, also as 
Russia's former Soviet satellite state ally was targeted for expanded EU sanctions, including an imminent expected 
blacklisting of national carrier Belavia. 
 The Bidenadministration is also said to be drawing up a list of targeted sanctions, but for now it's looking like a new 
Cold War over the skies of Europe is playing out, potentially severely disrupting popular international travel and 
transit routes and leading to a worsened diplomatic standoff. 
 Germany's transport ministry said on Wednesday that it had denied three RussianAeroflot flights access to its 
airspace and another four on Wednesday in response to prior Lufthansa flight cancelations that were the direct 
result of Russian policy[4]: 
'Due to the reciprocal practice, the Federal Aviation Authority also did not issue any further permits for flights 
operated by Russian airlines as long as authorizations are pending on the Russian side,' it added. 
 .'Once permits for Lufthansa flights are granted by the Russian site, the flights of Russian airlines will also be 
authorized,' added the German ministry. 
Cold War Over EU Skies: Germany Blocks All Inbound Russian Flights In Huge Escalation
Recall too that Air France flights had been impacted by lack of Russian flight path approval as early as a week ago 
after broad EU-wide avoidance of Belarusian airspace. The Kremlin had tried to downplay it at the time as vaguely 
based on 'technical' reasons. 
 As the below comment from an Atlantic Council pundit reveals, the May 23 Ryanair incident is increasingly being 
blamed on Putin's Russia, given his longtime support for the Belarusian strongman 
 #Germany[5] does not exclude #Russia[6]'s involvement in the Ryanair incident.This was stated by the head of the

years,it is partly because of Russia that Lukashenko is still in power pic.twitter.com/We6zYwkTvC[9] 
 — Hanna Liubakova (@HannaLiubakova) May 26, 2021[10] 
 Further upping the ante, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg weighed in on Wednesday saying more 
punitive actions are on the table my the Western military alliance over what was widely condemned as 
Lukashenko's authorized 'state hijacking' of the Ryanair flight last month. 
 'I think the most important thing now is to make sure that those sanctions that are agreed are fully implemented,' he 
said [11]in what's looking to be a major coordinated sanctions avalanche involving the US, EU, and UK. 'It has to be 
clear that when a regime like the regime in Minsk behaves in the way they did, violating basic international norms 
and rules, we will impose costs on them.'

flights[4] will be operational twice a week from Jun 16 onward. From Teesside, the carrier will also begin services to

EU agency beefs up stance against using Belarusian airspace
EU agency beefs up stance against using Belarusian airspace

BERLIN (AP) — The European Union Aviation Safety Agency on Wednesday beefed up its stance on the use of 
Belarusian airspace, calling on member countries' authorities to formally bar their airlines from flying over the 
country.
EASA, based in Cologne, Germany, had issued a “safety information bulletin” advising operators to avoid the 
airspace of Belarus following the May 23 incident in which Belarusian flight controllers told the crew of a Ryanair 
plane en route from Greece to Lithuania to land because there was a bomb threat against it.
No bomb was found once the place was on the ground, but 26-year-old Belarusian journalist Raman Pratasevich 
was arrested along with his Russian girlfriend.
EU leaders denounced it as a hijacking and an act of piracy. They responded by barring Belarusian carriers from 
the bloc’s airspace and sketching out tougher sanctions.
In a new safety directive, EASA said “information from air traffic management indicates that there are still operators 
having their principal place of business in EASA Member States that continue to operate” in Belarus' airspace. It 
didn't give further details.
The directive calls on national authorities to tell their aircraft operators “that conducting operations in Belarus 
airspace ... is no longer allowed, unless required for safe operations in unforeseen circumstances.”

An easing of travel restrictions is starting to show through in passenger numbers though airlines are still cautious 
about calling a recovery.
Ryanair PLC (LON:RYA) said it carried 1.8mln passengers in May, compared to just 70,000 a year ago, with planes 
79% full.
On a twelve-month rolling basis, passengers carried dropped by 75% to 30.2mln from 121mln.
Wizz Air PLC (LON:WIZZ) reported the number of passengers travelling had risen to 833,000 in May from 207,000 
a year ago, with its planes 66% full.
József Váradi, Wizz Air's chief executive, said the pick-up in passenger numbers had come later than expected and 
this would be another year of transition for the airline.
Wizz Air would make another loss in this financial year if flight restrictions were not lifted soon and permanently, he 
added.
The Hungarian carrier posted a loss of (EURO)567mln in the year to March just ended, though it increased the size 
of its fleet and also the number of its bases where it operates to 43 from 25 before the pandemic.
Váradi said this quarter it would run at 30% capacity with the intention of being back at full service in the financial 
year 2023.
Ryanair , Wizz Air carry more passengers but want restrictions to ease further
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary yesterday also called for an easing of restrictions in Europe.
He wants Grant Shapps to include all EU countries in the next revision of the UK's green list so UK holidaymakers 
can travel "restriction-free to the beaches of Spain, Greece and Italy".
"There is no justification for the UK government to delay the removal of all travel restrictions for those who have 
been fully vaccinated when research from Public Health England has demonstrated that two doses of the C-19 
vaccines are highly effective against the Indian variant," he wrote in a letter to the transport secretary.
Shares in Wizz Air dropped 1.7% to 4,791p while Ryanair eased 0.4% to (EURO)17.05.

After a brief aeropolitical standoff that led to the cancellation of three flights to Moscow last week, authorities in 
Russia have now approved all European Union-based carrier flight plans for Russia which bypass sanctioned 
Belarus. Following the May 23 forced diversion of a Ryanair B737-800 to Minsk National while en route from Athens 
Int'l to Vilnius, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a non-binding safety information bulletin 
recommending all airlines bypass Belarus airspace. As all EU carriers started adhering to the bulletin, Moscow 
entered the tussle by rejecting three flight plans - two Air France flights from Paris CDG to Moscow Sheremetyevo 
and one Austrian Airlines flight from Vienna to Moscow Domodedovo - which were due to bypass Belarus. 
However, Reuters has since reported that the dispute was resolved relatively quickly with all Belarus-bypassing 
flight plans now approved by Moscow. Air France resumed services to the Russian capital on May 29 and Austrian 
Airlines on May 28. No other airline was affected by Moscow's grandstanding, despite concerns that its refusal to 
accept alternative routes might become more widespread. While EASA recommended that all airlines avoid 
Belarus, it has no power to influence non-EU/EFTA carriers. Thus far, most non-EU carriers continue to fly through 
the country's airspace. Only Singapore Airlines has so far explicitly said that it would avoid entering Belarusian 
airspace due to safety concerns. The east of Ukraine (Donbas), which is controlled by Russia-backed separatists, 
remains off-limits to all airlines following the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines B777-200(ER). Crimea, which is 
recognised as part of Ukraine but is de facto occupied by Russia, is only accessible to Russian airlines. As a result, 
airlines flying between Europe and northeast Asia that bypass Belarus are forced to take either a northerly route 
over Lithuania and Latvia or a significantly longer southern track via Turkey.

Flight approval dispute briefly halts German - Russian air traffic
Flight approval dispute briefly halts German-Russian air traffic

Air traffic between Germany and Russia was briefly disrupted on Wednesday due to a dispute over flight approvals 
that left passengers stranded.
The two sides started locking horns on Wednesday morning, when two Lufthansa flights departing from Frankfurt 
had to be scrapped because Russian authorities had failed to issue the necessary permits.
In response, the German Federal Aviation Office said it would not issue any further permits for incoming flights by 
Russian airlines until the Russian authorities had approved flights from Germany.
Consequently, flights by Russian airlines Aeroflot and S7 could not take place on Wednesday.
The quarrel appeared to be resolved by Wednesday evening, when German carrier Lufthansa said it had received 
permission to land in Moscow and St Petersburg for the entire month of June.
The Transport Ministry in Berlin confirmed that permission had been granted to Lufthansa and so Russian airlines 
were once again allowed to land in Germany.
According to ministry sources, the row has its origins in March 2020.
At that time, Russia unilaterally suspended bilateral flight agreements due to the coronavirus pandemic.
As a result, the overall number of flights were reduced and the journeys had to be approved on a monthly basis.
But other tensions over flights erupted in the wake of last month's forced diversion to Belarus of a Ryanair plane, 
which was travelling from Greece to Lithuania.
Flight approval dispute briefly halts German - Russian air traffic
Once at the airport in Minsk, Belarusian activist journalist Roman Protasevich was taken into custody along with his 
girlfriend.
The incident was described as a "state hijacking" by Greece and led to widespread outrage at Belarus' long-time 
authoritarian ruler Alexander Lukaschenko, who is backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The European Union urged airlines based in the bloc to avoid Belarus airspace. That led air carriers to draw up 
revised flight paths to Russia, but in some cases Russia denied the new applications, including for Air France and 
Austrian Airlines.
The Russian aviation authority said that it could not keep pace with the large number of such applications that 
needed to be processed, leading to the cancellations.

Russian court jails activist Pivovarov for two months pending trial

A court in southern Russia ruled on Wednesday that prominent dissident Andrei Pivovarov should be kept in 
custody for two months pending trial.
The court in Krasnodar said the 39-year-old, who until recently led the group Open Russia, was being investigated 
for involvement in an "undesirable organization."
The designation was given to Open Russia, which had been openly critical of the Kremlin, just days ago.
Pivovarov was detained Monday evening while attempting to leave for Poland.
He was taken off a flight operated by Poland's LOT airline before departure in St Petersburg. Police officers had 
stopped the plane, which was already taxiing down the runway, Pivovarov wrote on his Telegram channel.
He was then transferred to the southern city of Krasnodar because, his lawyer explained, Pivovarov had published 
several Facebook posts from Krasnodar about a year ago and they were now being investigated.
The European Union and Amnesty International called for Pivovarov's immediate release.
Polish officials, meanwhile, criticized Russia for the action taken on board one of its planes.
"This is clearly an unacceptable situation," Polish government spokesperson Piotr Mueller told public radio 
broadcaster Polskie Radio on Wednesday.
Pawel Mucha, advisor to Polish President Andrzej Duda, said that Poland's civil aviation authority will analyse the 
data from the flight in question, provided by LOT airline, and that "appropriate and adequate" reactions will be taken 
on the basis of international and aviation law.
Russian court jails activist Pivovarov for two months pending trial
If found guilty, Pivovarov may face up to six years in prison.
Pivovarov had announced he would disband Open Russia, which has also been supported by Mikhail 
Khodorkovsky, a powerful critic of President Vladimir Putin, after it was deemed an "undesirable organization."
The fact that he was still detained anyway was a sign of "complete lawlessness," wrote Pivovarov.
Pivarov's lawyer linked the imprisonment to her client's intention to run in the parliamentary elections in September. 
That had scared Putin's United Russia party, Tatyana Usmanova said.
"You don't love Putin? Then they'll poison you, lock you up and torture you in prison," wrote the team of well-known 
imprisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who narrowly survived a poison attack last year.
Navalny, who is being held in a prison camp, expressed solidarity with Pivovarov and other detained opposition 
figures. "These are honest people who are being persecuted precisely for this," Navalny wrote on Instagram.
Khodorkovsky's team said Pivovarov had been taken off the plane "Belarusian style," referring to last month's 
forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk so that authoritarian ruler Alexander Lukashenko could jail one his 
opponents, the activist journalist Roman Protasevich.

 Airline companies said flights between Germany and Russia had resumed Wednesday evening, after each country 
blocked the other's incoming flights as part of the fall-out from tensions over Belarus. 
German airline Lufthansa told AFP that the Russian authorities had finally granted it clearance for passenger flights 
to Russia in June. 
"That means Lufthansa flights to Moscow and Saint Petersburg can be operated as planned," said a spokeswoman 
for the airline. 
In Russia, Mikhail Poluboyarinov, chief executive of Aeroflot told the TASS news agency: "Everything is fine, we 
have received all the authorisations." 
And another Russian airline, S7, said it too had received clearance for its flights to Germany, the Ria Novosti 
agency reported. 
Earlier Wednesday, Germany's transport ministry said it had blocked flights operated by Russian airlines from 
arriving in its territory after Moscow failed to provide authorisations for Lufthansa. 
Two Russia-bound Lufthansa flights due to depart earlier Wednesday from Germany had been cancelled because 
Russian authorities did not provide the necessary permits for them in time, the ministry said. 
 "Due to the reciprocal practice, the Federal Aviation Authority also did not issue any further permits for flights 
operated by Russian airlines as long as authorisations are pending on the Russian side," it added. 
Three Aeroflot flights were affected by the cancellations on Tuesday and another four on Wednesday, the ministry 
said.

"Once permits for Lufthansa flights are granted by the Russian site, the flights of Russian airlines will also be 
authorised," it added. 
Neither the ministry nor the airlines concerned mentioned the reason for the flights being blocked. 
But some flights operated by European airlines including Air France and Austrian Airlines -- a subsidiary of 
Lufthansa -- were cancelled last week after Moscow rejected flight plans that would have skipped Belarusian 
airspace. 
Lufthansa has confirmed that it is no longer flying over Belarus after the EU urged airlines to avoid the country's 
airspace. 
Germany - Russia Flights Resume After Tit-for-tat Cancellations
The EU's advice came after the Belarusian regime forced the diversion of a Ryanair Athens-Vilnius plane to Minsk 
in order to arrest an opposition journalist on board. 
Moscow last week said the cancellation of several European flights to Moscow was down to "technical reasons". 
Eurocontrol, which coordinates air traffic control in the EU, said flights between Europe and Russia "have 
permission to use defined air corridors. 
"If one company changes these routes, there has to be prior agreement between the company concerned and 
Russia."

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC on Wednesday reported a significant increase in passenger numbers for 
May compared to a virus-depressed May 2020, on the continued easing of global travel restrictions and the 
increased rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in Europe.
For the month, the Swords, Ireland-based budget airline said it flew 1.8 million passengers in May, up from 1.0 
million in April and from just 70,000 a year ago. It said it operated 12,000 flights during May with a 79% load factor. 
On a rolling annual basis however, Ryanair flew 30.2 million passengers, down 75% from 121.1 million a year 
before.
On Saturday, the Irish government said it would broadly implement the EU's digital Covid certificate from July 19, 
facilitating travel between EU member states, Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
The digital Covid certificate will facilitate free movement in the EU for people who have been vaccinated or can 
provide a negative PCR test taken 72 hours prior to arrival. However, restrictions will remain in place for Great 
Britain and the US.
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were up 0.2% at EUR17.15 on Wednesday in London.

Highlight: Teesside International Airport (MME) in England has unveiled its terminal following the completion of a 
multimillion-pound redevelopment project.
Body
The revamp has seen the airport modernised with new check-in desks, along with a modified security area. The 
security area has been equipped with body and baggage scanners for streamlining security checks. As part of the 
project, several new food and drink outlets and two luxury lounges have also been introduced at the airport. 
Notably, 92% of all terminal enhancements, including design, electrical work, construction and renovations, were 
executed by local companies. During the unveiling, the first Ryanair flight also departed from the airport for Palma in 
Spain. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: "This goes beyond just a facelift, giving it a new lease of life, with 
modernised check-in and security reducing stress and waiting times, and cafe, bars, lounges and shops making 
your full travel experience better than ever. "Today also marks the first Ryanair flight from our airport, another major 
milestone in our plans and one which has come well ahead of schedule. "We're also capitalising on the huge 
opportunity that is our Freeport status with our Southside logistics and manufacturing site firmly ready to position 
the airport more than ever as a hub for growth." Houchen adds: "When we first brought this airport back into public 
control, we knew the massive potential that it possessed, but a lack of commitment and funding for years left it 
looking dated and stuck in the past. It simply wasn't fit for purpose to process the hundreds of thousands of new 
passengers we're working to attract as part of our ten-year turnaround plan." After the lifting of lockdown curbs due 
to the pandemic, the airport has been collaborating with all airline partners to reinstate their flights in the near future. 
Presently, regional airline Loganair is serving Aberdeen, Belfast, Bristol, Newquay and London Heathrow. From 
next month, a third daily Heathrow service will commence, followed by Jersey in the coming weeks.

EU returnees Ryanair calls for scrapping of restrictions

Ryanair has called on the UK to open up travel from the EU for those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, 
two days before the government is due to revise its "green list" of destinations.
The airline also branded "nonsensical" a requirement for arrivals from low-risk countries to undergo costly virus 
tests.
Transport secretary Grant Shapps is due to update the list of countries on the UK's traffic light system for 
international travel, with tiered restrictions for different places.
Only a handful of destinations, including Portugal and Australia, are on the "green list" of countries from which 
travellers can return without going into a 10-day quarantine.
Shapps has indicated that European holiday destinations could be added.
Ahead of tomorrow's revision, Ryanair urged the transport secretary to scrap the curbs for those returning from the 
EU who had had both doses.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said there was "no justification" for a delay and that research showed that two 
vaccine doses were highly effective against the Indian variant.
The carrier also wants the PCR testing requirement to be scrapped for those who have been to destinations on the 
green list.
