 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) said Thursday its Spanish pilots accepted a four-year deal that includes 20% pay cuts to 
limit the number of job losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The agreement with Spanish pilot union SEPLA also comprises productivity improvements on rosters, flexible 
working patterns and annual leave.
The Irish budget airline, however, failed to reach deals with Spanish cabin crew unions USO and SITCPLA.
Ryanair fell 3% on Thursday's close.

Ryanair's Spanish pilots accepted on Thursday a 20% pay cut and work practice changes, the latest deal the Irish 
airline has struck with trade unions in exchange for a pledge to minimize job losses.
Europe's biggest budget airline warned it would have to cut up to 3,000 jobs if it could not agree pay cuts with pilots 
and cabin crew after the COVID-19 crisis grounded 99% of its planes from April to June and continued to hit 
business thereafter.
Ryanair had reached agreements with 85% of its pilots and 75% of cabin crew by the end of July, including in other 
major markets such as Britain, Ireland and Germany.
However, it said on Thursday it had failed to strike a deal with Spanish cabin crew unions USO and SITCPLA, 
making job losses among their members more likely.
Ryanair this week reduced its capacity by a further 20% during September and October after a reimposition of 
some travel restrictions led to weak bookings.
Criticizing Ireland's strict restrictions that allow unencumbered travel to and from just 10 European countries, 
Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary warned on Wednesday of more jobs losses in its Irish operations.
While bookings were continuing to build in Germany, Italy and most other European countries, they were "terrible" 
in Ireland and certainly down 50% year-on-year, O'Leary told Irish national broadcaster RTE in an interview.

Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) has announced that its British subsidiary Wizz Air UK (W9, London Luton) will open a new 
base at London Gatwick airport on October 22, 2020, with a single A321-200 stationed at the airport. The low-cost 
carrier will launch routes from Gatwick to Malta Int'l, Lanzarote (3x weekly each), Athens Int'l, and Naples 
Capodichino (4x weekly each). Gatwick will be its third base in the United Kingdom and second in the capital, after 
London Luton and the recently announced Doncaster/Sheffield base (which is also due to open on October 22, 
2020). Wizz Air currently serves Gatwick from its existing bases at Bucharest Otopeni, Budapest, Cluj-Napoca, 
Gdansk, Kraków, and Sofia, the ch-aviation schedules module shows. According to the ch-aviation fleets advanced 
module, Wizz Air UK operates three A320-200s and seven A321-200s. London Gatwick is the largest base of rival 
LCC easyJet (U2, London Luton). The airport is also a hub for British Airways (BA, London Heathrow), although the 
carrier's commitment to Gatwick is uncertain in the long-term, and for Norwegian Group carriers. 
Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) does not have a base at Gatwick and maintains a relatively limited presence at the airport 
with a 3.3% market share by capacity in the week starting on August 24.

? US stocks climb to another intraday peak ? Pound strengthens ahead of renewed Brexit negotiations ? Gold's 
volatile run continues with the precious metal sinking 2% Global stocks edged higher yesterday a day after Wall 
Street climbed to its first record close since the pandemic roiled markets in February.
The S&P 500 hit a fresh intraday high at lunchtime in New York, climbing 0.2 per cent, with technology the best 
performing sector.
The peak in US stocks comes despite "historic social and economic upheaval", said Seema Shah, chief strategist at 
Principal Global Investors, meaning investors were "right to be cautious".
Wall Street's rapid rebound comes against a backdrop of persistently high Covid-19 cases. Coronavirus deaths in 
the US rose by more than 1,000 for the first time in three days on Tuesday.
Wall Street's rally also owes much to a "handful of companies", added Ms Shah. The five largest stocks in the S&P 
500 account for a quarter of the benchmark's advance since a sell-off in late March.
Across the Atlantic, the region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 closed up 0.7 per cent with bruised travel companies 
rebounding after Heathrow announced an on-site Covid-19 testing facility in an effort to cut quarantine times. The 
airport was, however, awaiting government approval for the scheme.
Airlines Ryanair and easyJet rallied while British Airways parent company IAG climbed more than 7 per cent.
The day in the markets What you need to know
Elsewhere in Europe, the pound approached its strongest level against the dollar this year, hitting a high of 
$1.3267, "although much of that is dollar related", said Derek Halpenny, head of Global Markets research at MUFG 
Bank, pointing to the weakness in the US currency. Sterling later pared back earlier gains to settle at $1.316.
Analysts at ING have characterised some traders as being "over complacent" when it comes to the pound.
"Sterling's recent good performance and resilience to grim economic data has likely relied on the Brexit story being 
put on the backburner by investors," said the Dutch bank, but "that could be about to change as negotiations 
restart".
Talks between London and Brussels resumed yesterday.
The possibility for the Bank of England adopting negative interest rates also weighed on the pound, said Mr 
Halpenny.
Government bonds were littlechanged, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury slipping 1 basis point to 0.66 per 
cent, but gold's volatile run continued with the metal sinking more than 2 per cent to $1,9600 an ounce after several 
large swings last week. Ray Douglas

Aug 19, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Per a recent Airlines for 
America (A4A) study, the number of air travelers being screened by the Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) plummeted nationally. On average, there has been a 50% reduction in flight departures with states like New 
York, Hawaii, Washington DC, Vermont, Massachusetts and New Jersey reporting more than 80% decline in the 
TSA checkpoint volumes. Low Traffic The latest total traveler throughput as of Aug 17 was 773,319. Prior to the 
ongoing global health crisis, U.S. airlines were transporting a record 2.5 million passengers and 58,000 tons of 
cargo each day. As travel constraints and stay-at-home orders were implemented, demand for air travel dropped 
sharply. 
In short, the estimated COVID-19-triggered loss outbreak is at least more than $98 billion in the first half of 
2020.Majority of the airline stocks have depreciated over the past week, causing the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to 
decline 5.6% to $55.94, showing that the coronavirus pandemic took a heavy toll on the airline industry.A4A further 
noted that the industry has a long road to recovery ahead. Air travel took three years to rebound from the 9/11 terror 
attacks and more than seven years to see a revival from the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Market pundits believe 
that it may take at least two years or longer this time for the aviation industry to bounce back to its pre-COVID 
levels.Additionally, the spike in the cases of COVID-19 infection in some European countries will further foil 
passengers' travel plans. Earlier during the week, Germany joined the U.K. in imposing a two-week quarantine on 
flyers returning from Spain.Revenue declines and losses forced some airliners to suspend their dividend payouts 
and seek a relief under bankruptcy protection code. Companies like Alaska Air and Ryanair will be trimming 
respective capacities due to lower forward bookings. Increase in US-China Flight Frequency However, the news by 
The U.S. Transportation Department that U.S. and China agreed to double the number of airline flights between the 
two countries to eight per week bodes well for the concerned industry. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, there were 
more than 300 flights a week between the two countries. But the flight frequency took a hit as demand for 
international air travel dried up.It was announced that United Airlines (UAL) will increase flight services to China to 
four flights per week from San Francisco to Shanghai beginning Sep 4 while Delta Air Lines (DAL) will expand to 
four weekly flights. The deal marks a further easing of a standoff between the world's two biggest economies over 
the pandemic-led travel bans. Government Aid Also, another financial stimulus from the Congress augurs well for 
the airline industry. Possibility of a second airline bailout package strengthened after President Donald Trump 
backed the proposed extension of the Payroll Support Program under the Cares Act. In fact, a group of 16

Republicans signed a recently, pleading for another financial relief.Moreover, travel stocks will get a boost as the 
State Department removed the warning on U.S. citizens against traveling abroad Airline Stocks in Focus Though 
travel will remain under pressure, the surge in flight operations to and from China, government grants and a gradual 
resurgence in travel demand put the airline industry on investors' radar to set sights on.Hence we shortlist a few 
stocks, each of which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[1].Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[2] operates low-cost passenger carriers. It 
focuses on linking leisure travelers in small and medium-sized cities to world-class destinations.Though Allegiant 
Travel had an impressive record of dividend payments and share repurchases, it suspended the same following the 
coronavirus threat. The company's efforts to modernize its fleet look impressive, which drive its fuel efficiency in the 
process.I's earnings growth rate for the past five-year period is 12%. Its expected earnings growth rate for the next 
five-year period is 20.9%, higher than the industry average of 10.8%.Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] is an ultra-low 
fare carrier, offering scheduled-passenger airline services in Ireland, the UK, Continental Europe, Morocco and 
Israel. Following months of fleet groundings amid coronavirus concerns, Ryanair resumed operations across 90% 
of its routes in July. Flying schedules are expected to gradually rise to 60% in August and 70% in September. The 
company's cost-cutting measures to combat coronavirus-related adversities are also encouraging.Its earnings 
growth rate for the past five-year period is 3%. Its expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 
24%, higher than the industry average of 10.8%.Copa Holdings' CPA[4] cost-reduction efforts augur well. The 
airline anticipates to reduce its monthly cash burn to approximately $66 million in the second half of 2020 from $77 
million in the second quarter of 2020.The company is undergoing a fleet upgrade, which will improve its operating 
efficiency.Its expected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period is 13.6%, higher than the industry average

easyJet (U2, London Luton) has confirmed the closure of bases at each of London Stansted, London Southend, 
and Newcastle, GB effective August 31 as the budget airline consolidates its headcount amid depressed COVID-19 
travel demand. In a statement, the UK-headquartered LCC said London Stansted and Newcastle would remain part 
of its route network, and some domestic and international flights will continue to operate, served by inbound flying 
from other bases across its network. "During the consultation, we have identified ways to reduce the numbers of 
proposed compulsory redundancies across the business as a whole by offering enhanced voluntary redundancy 
packages to all UK crew as well as looking at additional options like part time and seasonal contracts, base 
transfers where possible and unpaid leave," it said. 
"As a result the number of compulsory redundancies will be significantly reduced, for example, through the 
consultation process with Unite 93% of our cabin crew who were at risk of redundancy have opted for an enhanced 
voluntary redundancy package." Through its easyJet UK (U2, London Luton) subsidiary, easyJet's other UK bases 
include Belfast Int'l, Bristol Int'l, Edinburgh, Glasgow Int'l, Liverpool, London Gatwick, London Luton, and 
Manchester Int'l. According to the ch-aviation capacities module, for the current week i.e. August 17-23, easyJet 
accounts for 5.98% of the 196,655 seats on offer at London Stansted (i.e. fourth behind Ryanair, Malta Air, and 
Jet2), 38.18% of the 13,641 seats on offer at London Southend (i.e. second behind Ryanair), and 22.89% of the 
29,853 seats on offer at Newcastle (second behind Jet2).

? Europe's travel and leisure sector hit by return of coronavirus restrictions ? Rally in haven assets sends gold back 
towards $2,000 ? Central bank stimulus helps lift Chinese stocks Stocks drifted higher and haven assets rebounded 
against a backdrop of flareups in coronavirus cases across the globe. For the second consecutive session, stocks 
linked to tourism sank as outbreaks in Europe led to the reintroduction of quarantine measures, such as the closure 
of nightclubs in Spain and Italy.
Ryanair fell 6 per cent after the lowcost airline announced it was cutting flight capacity by a fifth during the next two 
months because of weak bookings.
Europe's travel and leisure sector, which is down more than a third this year, dipped 1.5 per cent yesterday, trailing 
the wider Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark, which rose 0.3 per cent.
Elsewhere in Europe, London's commodities-leaning FTSE 100 was up 0.6 per cent, with miners among the biggest 
gainers. Anglo-American and Fresnillo climbed 2.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively.
Another miner that gained was Barrick Gold, which rallied after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it 
had added the world's second-largest miner of gold to its holdings.
The precious metal rose yesterday during a modest rally in haven assets, climbing 2.4 per cent to $1,987 an ounce.
Core government bonds, another asset considered relatively safe, were also in demand. The yield in the 10-year 
US Treasury slid 4 basis points to 0.67 per cent.
What you need to know The day in the markets
Wall Street was hovering near its alltime high at lunchtime in New York, with tech companies that have fared well 
during the pandemic rising.
Investors in mainland China appeared to brush aside simmering geopolitical tensions, focusing instead on the 
Rmb700bn ($101bn) of liquidity that was pumped into the domestic financial system by the People's Bank of China.
The CSI 300 index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks climbed 2.4 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng 
was 0.7 per cent higher. Elsewhere in Asia, Tokyo's Topix closed down 0.8 per cent. This came as Japan reported 
a 7.8 per cent fall in second-quarter gross domestic product.
However, Miguel Chanco, senior Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expected Japan's growth 
"bounceback in the current quarter to the tune of 6 per cent", although the recovery would be "more gradual than 
the steepness of the downturn, due to the second Covid-19 wave [hanging] over domestic demand and the still-
uneven relaxation of restrictions globally". Ray Douglas

Ryanair has cut back its flight schedule for the coming months after Europe's largest low-cost carrier warned that 
bookings had "noticeably weakened" following the rise in virus cases across many parts of Europe.
The resurgence of the virus is deepening the crisis facing the travel industry, as new government restrictions dash 
hopes of a late-summer tourism revival.
"Forward bookings have notably weakened over the last 10 days, given uncertainty over recent Covid case rates in 
some EU countries," Ryanair said.
In response, the airline will reduce the number of passengers it carries by 20 per cent in September and October.
The cuts will focus on countries where outbreaks are worsening, including France and Spain, and will come mainly 
from flying fewer planes on its network rather than eliminating routes altogether.
Ryanair had previously indicated that it hoped to run 70 per cent of its normal schedule in September, more than 
some low-cost rivals, including easyJet.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, has said that a second wave of Covid-19 infections in the autumn is his biggest 
worry, and the disruption to his airline's business has come even sooner than feared.
Ryanair cuts autumn flight capacity by 20% Airlines ; Bookings weaken as fresh curbs dash hopes of seasonal 
upturn
Last month he cautioned that further disruption could lead to more pay cuts and job losses, after the airline fell to a 
loss in the three months to the end of June. The carrier has said it plans to axe up to 3,000 jobs.
Analysts believe, however, that Ryan-air is well placed to ride out the storm facing the sector, given that it typically 
operates from lower-cost airports and its finances are in better shape than some rivals. The airline had more than 
(EURO)3.9bn in cash at the end of June.
Shares in Ryanair led European airlines lower following the news, falling nearly 5 per cent.
EasyJet yesterday confirmed that it would close three of its UK hubs as part of plans to cut its workforce by 30 per 
cent. The airline will close its bases but still fly a scaled-down schedule from London Stansted and Newcastle, and 
entirely pull out of London Southend, the Essex airport it helped put onto the map over the past decade.
EasyJet's chief executive said the government's quarantine measures had "compounded" the lack of demand for 
seats.
The disruption to air travel came as one of the leading cross-Channel ferry operators said it could cut the numbers 
of crossings it sails following the introduction of quarantine rules for anyone entering the UK from France.
The chief executive of Brittany Ferries, which operates 12 ships between France, the UK, Ireland and Spain, said 
he was facing "tough decisions" on which routes to run.
The focus will be on countries where outbreaks are worsening, including France and Spain

Eurozone Shopping centre landlord Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield faded in the wake of reports last week that it was 
considering raising up to (EURO)3bn with a rights issue. The company said it was continuing to examine "all 
potential strategies" for strengthening its financial profile, with no decision made yet.
Kempen & Co analysts estimated that Unibail would need between (EURO)6bn and (EURO)8bn of new equity over 
the next three to five years, on top of (EURO)6bn from disposals. A smaller cash call in the short term may ease 
some of the pressure on its balance sheet and encourage short sellers to reduce their bets, said the broker.
Castellum, the Swedish property group, retreated after UBS cut its rating to "sell". A survey found that 82 per cent 
of Swedes were happy working from home, against 71 per cent of Germans, UBS said.
Tourism and leisure stocks slipped after the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium followed the UK in broadening 
their travel restrictions. Ryanair was the weakest among the airlines after warning of slower demand and 
announcing capacity cuts for September and October.
Pernod Ricard gained after Barclays upgraded the beverage group to "overweight", saying demand for premium

Aug 18, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Azul 
AZUL[1] reported a loss in second-quarter 2020 results. This underperformance was due to weak passenger 
revenues as a result of deteriorating air-travel demand, which emanated from the coronavirus pandemic. Notably, 
another Latin American carrier, Copa Holdings, CPA[2] also posted discouraging second-quarter earnings numbers 
in the previous week[3].On the non- earnings front, Alaska Air Group ALK[4] was the primary newsmaker, courtesy 
of its improved projection for August cash burn compared with July when ticket sales plummeted due to the 
renewed spike in coronavirus cases in the United States. Meanwhile, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] 
trimmed its capacity for both September and October due to the pandemic-induced uncertainty following the rise in 
infected cases in some European countries. 
Recap of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Azul incurred a loss of $2.38 per share (excluding $2.33 from non-
recurring items) in the second quarter of 2020, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.11. 
However, in the year-ago quarter, the company delivered adjusted earnings of 78 cents per share when air-travel 
demand was strong. Results were affected by the coronavirus-induced drop in demand and a 38% depreciation in 
the Brazilian Real. Also, total revenues of $74.9 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $103.4 million and 
declined 88.9% year over year as well. Further, passenger revenues, accounting for bulk (70.3%) of the top line, 
plummeted 88.6% year over year amid low demand due to coronavirus. Revenues from cargo and other sources 
too decreased 8.5% in the quarter. Consolidated load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) contracted 11.3 
percentage points to 72.8% as the fall in traffic (85.2%) was deeper than the capacity contraction (82.9%) in the 
second quarter.While total revenues per ASK (RASK) dropped 10.3%, passenger revenues per ASK (PRASK) 
plunged 33.6%. Moreover, cost per ASK (CASK) surged in excess of 100%, mainly due to capacity cuts. However, 
fuel price per liter decreased 42% in the June quarter. Also, average fare for the company declined 13.4% from the 
year-ago quarter's figure.Azul exited the second quarter with a passenger operating fleet size of 138 jets. The 
average age of the fleet is 6 years. Contractual passenger fleet size was 165. The company expects to achieve 
roughly 60% of the pre-coronavirus capacity levels by December 2020. For the remainder of this year, Azul 
anticipates a daily cash burn of approximately R$3 million, on average.Azul currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[6]2. Alaska Air anticipates 
its revenues for August to decline in the 70-75% band on a year-over-year basis due to weak demand for air travel. 
Airline Stock Roundup: AZUL 's Q2 Loss, ALK 's Bullish Cash-Burn Update & More
Revenue passengers for August 2020 are also predicted to plunge between 70% and 75% from August 2019 
readings. To combat the bleak demand scenario, Alaska Air is slashing capacity (measured in available seat miles 
or ASMs). ASMs for August are projected to be down nearly 50% from the year-ago levels. Courtesy of higher ticket 
sales, cash burn is projected to improve to less than $125 million in the current month from approximately $175 
million reported last month[7].3. Ryanair will be reducing capacity by 20% for September as well as October due to 
lower forward bookings of late as coronavirus cases in some European countries show a surge. The cuts will be 
focused on countries where the spurt in COVID-19 cases resulted in increased travel restrictions by the UK and 
Ireland. Moreover, the capacity reduction will mostly be felt in the form of decreased flight frequency rather than 
route closures.4 United Airlines UAL[8] is planning to add up to 28 daily non-stop flights to Florida this winter as air-
travel demand seems to be picking up after months of slowdown. The airline intends to add flights from New York, 
NY, Boston, MA and Cleveland, OH to the Florida cities of Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Orlando and Tampa, 
effective Nov 6[9].5. Per a CNBC report[10], American Airlines AAL[11] decided to cancel flights to up to 30 small 
and medium cities in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak-led tepid demand for air travel. The plan to shrink 
services will, however, not materialize before October, 2020. This is because of the fact that per the federal 
assistance to U.S. carriers under the CARES Act, airlines receiving the aid are required to maintain a minimum

Aug 18, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[1] will be cutting capacity by 20% for September and October due to a drop in bookings lately as 
coronavirus cases in some European Union countries surge. Following this news, shares of the company dipped 
2.4% at the close of business on Aug 17.The cuts will be focused on flights to countries on which travel restrictions 
have been imposed by the United Kingdom and Ireland because of a surge in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the 
capacity reduction would mostly be in the form of decreased frequency rather than route closures.Re-imposition of 
quarantine rules by United Kingdom and travel restrictions by Ireland have 'notably weakened' Ryanair's forward 
bookings over the last 10 days. The United Kingdom re-imposed quarantine rules on travelers coming from 
countries such as Spain, France and Sweden. Ireland's measures have been regarded as "uniquely restrictive" by 
the airline. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-RYAAY-
fundamental/price Ryanair Holdings PLC price[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3] It was only last month that the 
carrier resumed operations following months of fleet groundings amid coronavirus concerns. 
The airline is expected to have operated approximately 40% of its normal schedule in July. This Irish low-cost airline 
had planned to gradually increase flying schedules to 60% in August and 70% in September.Passengers affected 
as a result of the capacity cuts in the next two months would be informed of the alternative options they can avail.

LONDON (AP) — Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline, plans to cut capacity by 20% in September and October as a 
surge in COVID-19 cases dents bookings.
The low-cost carrier said Monday that most of the reductions would come from trimming the frequency of flights, 
rather than route closures. Ryanair said the cuts would be focused on flights serving countries such as Spain, 
France and Sweden, where a rise in coronavirus cases has triggered tighter travel restrictions.
The airline said in a statement that the curbs were “unavoidable given the recent weakness in forward bookings due 
to COVID restrictions in a number of EU countries.’’ Affected passengers will receive emails advising them of their 
options.
Dublin-based Ryanair also called on Ireland to ease restrictions on travel from countries where COVID-19 infection 
rates are lower than in Ireland. Travelers from countries like Germany and the U.K. are required to quarantine for 
two weeks, even though Ireland has a higher infection rate.
Meanwhile, British rival easyJet said it would move ahead with plans to close its bases at Stansted, Southend and 
Newcastle airports in England after consulting with unions.
The airline said all flights to and from Southend would be cancelled beginning Sept. 1. EasyJet said it will continue 
to serve Stansted and Newcastle from other hubs, but some flights to and from the airports will be cancelled.
EasyJet said in June that 1,900 jobs were at risk, but consultations continue and the overall number is likely to be 
lower. Of those at risk positions, some 670 pilot and crew jobs are located at the three bases whose closure was 
confirmed Monday.

Ryanair will reduce its flight capacity by a further 20% during September and October after a reimposition of some 
travel restrictions led to a notable weakness in forward bookings over the last 10 days, the Irish airline said on 
Monday.
Ryanair, which last month cut its passenger target to 60 million for the financial year to March 2021, from the 80 
million it had forecast in May, said a recent upsurge of COVID-19 cases in some European countries had 
particularly impacted business bookings.
Ryanair shares, which had rallied in recent sessions to their highest since early June, fell 4.4% to 11.22 euros by 
1220 GMT.
The airline said cuts will be heavily focused on France, Spain Ireland and Sweden, and would mostly involve 
frequency reductions rather than route closures. It had increased flights to 60% of its normal schedule this month 
after resuming services in July.
Europe's biggest budget airline said last month it expected to run around 70% of last year's schedule between 
October and March.
Increased travel restrictions have hit air traffic to Spain and France in recent weeks, while Ireland only allows 
unencumbered travel to 10 European countries, a policy Ryanair criticized again as "uniquely restrictive" on 
Monday.
Ryanair said impacted passengers will be advised of their options. (Reuters)

(ANSA) - 17 AGO - Six Roman youths have tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from the Sardinian 
resort of Porto Rotondo. They are two groups of three who attended a party there on August 8. Officials said a new 
cluster had been found at Porto Rotondo. Lazio's COVID crisis unit said the six had just tested positive. It added 
that new testing at Rome's Fiumicino Airport had detected a first positive case. It is a youth from Pescara in 
Abruzzo who flew back from Malta on a Ryanair flight. Contact tracing has been started, the unit said. "The young 
man has already been informed telephonically and placed in isolation", it said. A second case was then reported, a 
teenage Italian girl  back from the Greek island of Skiathos, via Athens. According to the latest figures Sunday, 
there were 472 new COVID cases across Italy in the previous 24 hours, 150 fewer than the previous daily tally in 
Italy. But the number of swabs was down too. Italy has been the second hardest hit European country after the UK. 
It has had over 35,000 COVID-related deaths. In all, it has had over 250,000 cases of the novel coronavirus. The 
government has ordered the re-closure of discotheques and the wearing of facemasks in 'movida' youth partying 
amid a spike among young people.

(ANSA) - 17 AGO - Italy had 320 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, 159 fewer than Sunday's rise of 479, 
the health ministry said Monday. But about 6,000 fewer swabs were taken in the last 24 hours, or some 30,666. The 
number of new dead was steady at four. The largest rises in infections were in Lazio (51), Veneto (46) and 
Lombardy (43). The total number of cases since the start of the pandemic has now risen to 254,235. The death toll 
is now 35,400. Molise and Basilicata are the only regions without new cases. 
Italy has shown its "moral and civic energies" during the coronavirus pandemic, President Sergio Mattarella said 
Monday.  "Our country has given proof, once again, of its moral and civic energies," Mattarella said in a message to 
the president of the foundation for the Friendship Meeting Between Peoples, Bernhard Scholz, devoted to the virus 
emergency. The annual Meeting of the Catholic militant movement Communion and Liberation will start in Rimini 
Tuesday. "Grasping change, which the European Union has been capable of in its response to the pandemic and in 
planning the restart, is today the premise for relaunching Italy," the head of State went on. "Only in European 
integration and solidarity can we build a fitting tomorrow for our children". Italy has been the second hardest hit 
European country after the UK. It has had over 35,000 COVID-related deaths. In all, it has had over 250,000 cases. 
The government has ordered the re-closure of discotheques amid a spike among young people. It has also made 
facemasks mandatory between six o'clock in the evening and six in the morning where young people gather for 
their 'movida' partying. Mattarella has consistently praised Italy's response to the pandemic. Six Roman youths

Low-cost airline Ryanair on Monday said it plans to cut 20 per cent of regular flights in September and October after 
several European nations reimposed Covid-19 quarantine rules for arrivals.
The reduction in flight capacity comes after forward bookings "notably weakened over the last 10 days, given 
continuing uncertainty over recent Covid case rates in some EU countries," the airline said.
Most of the cuts will be reductions in frequency rather than suspension of routes, it said.
They will focus on countries including Spain, France, Sweden and Ireland.
Ireland has imposed a "uniquely restrictive Green List" that requires visitors from most other EU nations, including 
those with lower recent infection rates, Ryanair said.
"Proper testing at airports, and effective tracing - as is being conducted in Germany and Italy - is the only realistic 
and proportionate method of supervising safe intra-EU air travel while effectively limiting the spread of the Covid-19 
virus," a spokesperson said.
Britain, one of Ryanair's biggest markets, has reimposed a 14-day self-isolation requirement for arrivals from 
countries including Spain, France and Sweden.

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said Monday that it would reduce its flight capacity by 
20% during the months of September &October;, as weakness in forward bookings due to Covid restrictions in a 
number of European Union countries.
 The airline confirmed that most of those cuts would be frequency reductions rather than route closures. They will 
be heavily focused on those countries such as Spain, France and Sweden, where rising recent Covid case rates 
have led to increased travel restrictions, and Ireland which continues to impose a uniquely restrictive Green List, 
which imposes 14 day quarantines on visitors from most other EU countries such as Germany and the UK, which 
have lower Covid case rates over the last 14 days than Ireland.

resort of Porto Rotondo. They are two groups of three who attended a party there on August 8. Officials said a new 
cluster had been found at Porto Rotondo. Lazio's COVID crisis unit said the six had just tested positive. It added 
that new testing at Rome's Fiumicino Airport had detected a first positive case. It is a youth from Pescara in 
Abruzzo who flew back from Malta on a Ryanair flight. Contact tracing has been started, the unit said. "The young 
man has already been informed telephonically and placed in isolation", it said. According to the latest figures 
Sunday, there were 472 new COVID cases across Italy in the previous 24 hours, 150 fewer than the previous daily 
tally in Italy. But the number of swabs was down too. Italy has been the second hardest hit European country after 
the UK. It has had over 35,000 COVID-related deaths.

Aug 17, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Passengers board a Ryanair 
airplane, in Palermo, Italy, Saturday, Sept. 15, 2018. Italy's aviation authority, ENAC, has put RyanAir on notice that 
it has ''repeatedly violated'' rules aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus, warning that the budget carrier risks 
suspension in Italy unless it complies. ENAC said in a statement Wednesday, Aug. 
5, 2020 that RyanAir had repeatedly disregarded rules, calling it ''behavior disrespectful of the health measures in 
Italy.'' They include requiring passengers to wear masks, restricting baggage on board to small items placed in 
plastic bags and preventing crowding at baggage pickup. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)LONDON (AP) — Ryanair, 
Europe's largest airline, plans to cut capacity by 20% in September and October as a surge in COVID-19 cases 
dents bookings. The low-cost carrier said Monday that most of the reductions would come from trimming the 
frequency of flights, rather than route closures. Ryanair said the cuts would be focused on flights serving countries 
such as Spain, France and Sweden, where a rise in coronavirus cases has triggered tighter travel restrictions. The 
airline said in a statement that the curbs were 'unavoidable given the recent weakness in forward bookings due to 
COVID restrictions in a number of EU countries.'' Affected passengers will receive emails advising them of their 
options. Dublin-based Ryanair also called on Ireland to ease restrictions on travel from countries where COVID-19 
infection rates are lower than in Ireland. Travelers from countries like Germany and the U.K. are required to 
quarantine for two weeks, even though Ireland has a higher infection rate. Meanwhile, British rival easyJet said it 
would move ahead with plans to close its bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle airports in England after 
consulting with unions. The airline said all flights to and from Southend would be cancelled beginning Sept. 1. 
EasyJet said it will continue to serve Stansted and Newcastle from other hubs, but some flights to and from the 
airports will be cancelled. EasyJet said in June that 1,900 jobs were at risk, but consultations continue and the 
overall number is likely to be lower. Of those at risk positions, some 670 pilot and crew jobs are located at the three 
bases whose closure was confirmed Monday.10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy After the Market's Historic Sell-
Off[1]Technology stocks are among the most volatile in the market. The allure of big gains comes with the risk of 
sharp downturns. When the market is trending upwards, these stocks have a tendency to lead the way. Conversely, 
when the market is selling off, tech stocks post some of the largest losses. And in the coronavirus crash tech stocks 
took their usual beating. But an interesting dynamic is happening. As stocks are trying to stage a comeback, many 
tech stocks are being left behind. Many of the leading tech stocks trade on the NASDAQ exchange. However, as 
the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and S&#38;P 500 posted gains on March 25, the NASDAQ stayed down. 
And that's an opportunity for investors who know where to look. We've put together this presentation to give you ten

Should you travel? Will you? Without a yes to both questions airlines such as easyJet cannot expect an 
improvement to their dire financial situation. Further UK quarantine measures, now extended to France, will make 
life harder. This explains easyJet's announcement yesterday to complete the second of two sale and leaseback 
transactions to raise a total of £608m.
Shareholders will be happy that easyJet did not dilute its stock further with another equity offering. But these latest 
leases add debt to its balance sheet, which reduces manoeuvrability on fares for the months ahead. Still, it is better 
placed than many of its peers.
Of nearly 90 sizeable airlines, only four earn an investment grade rating; easyJet is one of them. In Europe, Ryanair 
and Wizz Air have stronger financial positions when measured by the proportion of net debt to enterprise value. For 
Ryanair and Wizz Air this proportion is less than a fifth, according to estimates from brokers Davy. EasyJet's is 
higher at about a third, but much better than Air France-KLM at 78 per cent. That tells a story. Most European 
airlines will not be able to fight for market share using cheap fares. Debts must be serviced.
At least intra-European air travel volumes have improved. Flight traffic for easyJet and Ryanair jumped by more 
than half in the first two weeks of August compared with the previous two weeks, according to Eurocontrol.
The profitable north Atlantic route is up by a fraction of that. Bad news for flag carriers such as International Airline 
Group's British Airways. IAG is planning an emergency fundraising, which is expected to double its shares 
outstanding.
EasyJet /European airlines: capital pains
European airlines have turned off internal algorithms balancing fares with demand. Price elasticity is not there and 
customers do not respond to discounting. When they do, capacity will come back quickly. Profitability will remain a 
long-haul destination for this industry for some time to come.

Holidaymakers scramble back from France to beat quarantine Prices for ferries, trains and planes soar as

Holidaymakers scramble back from France to beat quarantine; Prices for 
ferries, trains and planes soar as people rush to snap up scarce tickets

British holidaymakers in France packed their bags yesterday to return to the UK before a newly imposed quarantine 
comes into effect, following a rise in coronavirus infections.
Prices soared as people rushed to snap up the few remaining tickets for flights, trains and ferries to cross the 
English Channel before the deadline of 4am this morning.
The exodus came after Downing Street announced on Thursday evening that travellers coming from France, the 
Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Aruba would have to self-isolate on arrival in the UK 
after sharp increases in Covid-19 cases in those countries. Data from France this week showed a 66 per cent surge 
in newly reported cases while the Netherlands was up 52 per cent.
France is the second most popular holiday destination for Britons after Spain, attracting 10.3m visits in 2019, 
according to the government. Some 160,000 UK tourists were estimated to be in France on Thursday and many of 
the 300,000 French citizens who live in the UK and were on holiday were also thought to have returned home.
The French government said it regretted the British move and would impose reciprocal measures on travellers 
arriving in France from the UK, although it did not specify when they would start.

due to go on another holiday to Scotland on Monday. They would have been forced to cancel if they had been 
quarantined.
"As soon as we heard the news, we went on the Ryanair website to change the flights ... I could see the seats 
disappearing before my eyes," said Ms Armstrong.
Amelie, an investment banker who had been working and holidaying in Poitiers with her husband, said that after 
hearing the news at midnight on Thursday, the only two available Eurotunnel bookings were at 7am or 11.30am 
yesterday.
As she and her husband both had to return to the UK for work compliance reasons, they were forced to leave their 
children, who were staying with grandparents in another part of France. "The motorway was full but every other car 
had a British plate," she said.
Veronique Michaud, owner of the three-star Hotel Champs Fleurs in the popular Alpine village of Morzine, said 
some British families had left in a frenzy yesterday morning.
Some travellers decided to leave their cars behind in France and fly back after all ferries and trains were booked. 
Others could not afford to return. "I suspected, as everyone did, that the UK government would impose a quarantine 
on France as it was on the cards since earlier this week, so I really should have booked an earlier flight, but I 
didn't," said Tim Crombie, a self-employed artist in Marseille. "I've tried to book a flight now but it would cost over 
(EURO)600."
Eurotunnel, which runs car-carrying services through the Channel tunnel, said it had laid on extra staff to handle the 
"huge amount" of inquiries. Travellers reported queues of more than 4,500 people on Eurotunnel's website.
Kasper Moos, head of UK routes for DFDS, which runs ferry services to France and Holland, said there was not 
enough space on their ships to cope with the demand. "We are running out of slots for the weekend," he said.
Grant Shapps, transport secretary, told the BBC people knew that there was a "significant risk" if they were 
travelling abroad. He warned people would be "breaking the law" if they failed to quarantine for 14 days on return.
Travellers arriving this week from Spain and Belgium, both of which had previously been removed from the "safe 
corridors" list, reported a mixed picture on quarantine enforcement. Most reported being told to fill in forms detailing 
where they would isolate, but added that checks on whether they had complied were lax or non-existent.
Officials in Paris said they expected the French requirements on British visitors to be the same as the "voluntary" 
self-quarantine applied the last time the UK imposed quarantines on people coming across the Channel.
The quarantine could also significantly affect companies that serve incoming tourists to the UK.
"France and the Netherlands are crucial markets for the UK. We had only recently heard reports that these two 
markets had started a slow recovery - this obviously ends that," said Joss Croft, chief executive of the trade body 
UKInbound.
"Normally solvent and sturdy businesses now face a bleak future."
France is the second-largest source market for tourists into the UK after the US, accounting for £1.5bn worth of 
spending, according to the UK Tourism Alliance.

British holidaymakers in France packed their bags yesterday to return to the UK before a newly imposed quarantine 
came into effect, following a rise in coronavirus infections.
Prices soared as people rushed to snap up the remaining tickets for flights, trains and ferries before the deadline of 
4am this morning.
The exodus came after Downing Street announced on Thursday evening that travellers coming from France, the 
Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Aruba would have to self-isolate on arrival in the 
UK after sharp increases in Covid-19 cases in those countries. Data from France this week showed a 66 per cent 
surge in newly reported cases, while the Netherlands was up 52 per cent.
France is the second most popular holiday destination for Britons after Spain, attracting 10.3m visits in 2019, 
according to the government. Some 160,000 UK tourists were estimated to be in France on Thursday and many of 
the 300,000 French citizens who live in the UK were also thought to have returned home on holiday.
The French government said it regretted the British move and would impose reciprocal measures on travellers 
arriving in France from the UK, although it did not specify when they would start.

 European airlines were hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of 2020 but are now on their 
way to a slow recovery as lockdown restrictions are lifted gradually, according to a Friday release by Fitch Ratings.
Fitch said European airlines hedged a larger share of expected fuel consumption than their peers abroad before the 
pandemic, although they managed to slash costs and preserve cash through job and salary cuts, dividend 
cancellations and reduced maintenance spending, among other things.
The rating agency expects demand for domestic, short-haul and intra-Europe flights to be stronger than 
intercontinental or long-haul flights, with demand for leisure and personal trips to outpace corporate demand.
Ryanair (RYA.L) and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) are also expected to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels faster than 
international full-service carriers including International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG.L), Deutsche Lufthansa 
(LHAG.DE) and Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA).
IAG shares tumbled 6%, Ryanair declined 5% and Wizz Air fell 1% on Friday afternoon.

Aug 14, 2020( JD Supra: http://www.jdsupra.com Delivered by Newstex)  [co-authors: Ailbhe Dennehy, Therese 
Chambers]*In a cautionary tale for employers, the High Court of Ireland held in Ryanair DAC v. Bellew[1] that 
although Ryanair DAC's post-employment noncompete clause was justified given the nature of the strategic role of 
chief operations officer (COO), the scope of this clause (which covered all airlines in any capacity) was too wide; 
therefore, the clause is void.BackgroundRyanair's former COO, Peter Bellew, held 'one of the most senior executive 
roles in Ryanair.' He entered into a post-employment noncompete clause with Ryanair in consideration for 
participation in Ryanair's share option scheme. The noncompete clause provided that Bellew would not be 
'employed, engaged, concerned or interested in any capacity in any business wholly or partly in competition with 
the Company for air passenger services in any market' for 12 months following his departure.Bellew resigned from 
Ryanair in July 2019 and was due to join EasyJet Switzerland SA (easyJet) as COO on January 1, 2020. Ryanair 
commenced injunctive proceedings to prevent Bellew from joining easyJet until the noncompete period had 
elapsed.Ryanair asserted that Bellew was privy to 'confidential material and sensitive commercial and operational 
information,' and that Ryanair would be 'exposed to irremediable and unquantifiable loss and damage' if Bellew 
were to commence employment with easyJet. 
Bellew argued that the restraint Ryanair sought to impose was 'wholly unnecessary, unreasonable and 
unwarranted.'The High Court's FindingsAddressing the crucial issue of the enforceability of the restraint, the court 
confirmed that any restraint on a person working is 'by definition a restraint of trade,' and that such a restraint is void 
and unenforceable unless it is reasonable as between the parties and it is consistent with the public interest.The 
court ultimately agreed that the 'nature and extent of the confidential information that would inevitably come to the 
knowledge of Mr. Bellew in the course of his employment' justified a post-employment restraint. Of some relief to 
employers, the court stated that it had 'no difficulty with the time constraint' of 12 months. However, the court said 
that it was 'vexed' as to whether the restraint went 'further than is necessary for the legitimate protection of 
Ryanair's interest.'Ryanair argued that while it was in competition with all airlines, the main competition it faced was 
not from legacy airlines (i.e., high-cost airlines), but from low-cost carriers, of which easyJet was its 'most 
immediate rival.' However, from the court's perspective, the restraint applied to any business in competition with 
Ryanair for air services, including the legacy airlines. It also applied to any job that Bellew might take with a 
Post-Employment Restrictive Covenant Was Unenforceable Due to Being Too Wide, High Court of Ireland 
Rules
competitor, not just a similar role.Fatally, the court found that the restrictive covenant was too wide and 
consequently 'void and unenforceable as an unjustified restraint of trade.'CommentSo what can employers do to 
bolster the enforceability of their restrictive covenants?There is a delicate balance to be struck between a 
reasonable and justifiable restrictive covenant and a restraint designed simply to 'hobble' an employee in the 
'legitimate pursuit of his career.'In an effort to strike this balance, employers may want to be wary of overreliance on 
boilerplate restrictive covenants. It is vital that restrictions are tailored to each employee, taking into account his or 
her seniority and level of access to confidential information, and go no further than absolutely necessary to protect 
the employer's legitimate interests. Employers may also want to review their restrictive covenants often to reflect 
the

of 
an 
employee 
(e.g.,

Aug 14, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  European stocks fell 
on Friday as the UK added six more countries to its 14-day COVID-19 quarantine list.The UK's benchmark FTSE 
100 fell 1.9% and the Euro Stoxx 50 dropped 1.6% in early European trading.The decision, which comes into effect 
Saturday, implies that travellers arriving in the UK from countries including France and the Netherlands have a 
window of a little over 30 hours to return home to avoid restrictions.Data from Eurostat shows Eurozone GDP 
shrank 12% for the second quarter, its sharpest decline since records began in 1995.Visit Business Insider's 
homepage for more stories[1]. European stocks tumbled on Friday after the UK added six more countries[2] to its 
COVID-19 travel quarantine list, which weighed heavily on airline and travel stocks.The decision means that 
travellers arriving in the UK from France, Netherlands, Malta, Monaco, Aruba, and the Turks and Caicos Islands will 
be required to self-isolate for 14 days. Anyone breaking the rules will be liable for a fine.London's benchmark FTSE 
100 fell 1.9%, on course for its biggest one-day fall this month, while the Euro Stoxx 50 fell 1.6%, also set for its 
largest one-day decline this month.Weighing heavily on the European travel industry, the UK's latest restrictions 
"contributed to a moody open for the continent's markets" and "the FTSE continued to unwind its hard-to-justify

added over 2,524 new coronavirus cases[10] in 24 hours — the highest one-day rise since its lockdown lifted in 
May.Spain, another popular destination, was removed from Britain's "travel corridor"[11] last month, meaning any 
UK-based visitors must also quarantine for 14 days upon their return.Separately, oil prices fell on Friday with

Amsterdam, Brussels airports introduce mobile coronavirus testing
Amsterdam, Brussels airports introduce mobile coronavirus testing

The main airports in Amsterdam and Brussels are rolling out mobile coronavirus testing points for passengers in an 
effort to curb the pandemic.
In Amsterdam, passengers on some flights returning from countries deemed high risk in terms of infections can be 
tested for free as of Thursday.
This includes passengers without symptoms, the public health authority announced. The test results are to be 
available within 48 hours.
Testing capacity is currently limited at the Dutch airport, but the health authority plans to offer up to 600 tests a day 
as soon as possible, it said in a press release.
People are not required to undergo testing on returning to the Netherlands for legal reasons, the health authority 
said.
In a similar approach, Brussels Airport in neighbouring Belgium announced on Thursday that it would roll out mobile 
testing in early September.
Passengers returning from countries or areas designated as belonging to a red zone - meaning they are deemed 
high risk by the Belgian authorities - can be tested at the airport.
At the mobile testing stations, "passengers returning from a red zone can be tested immediately upon arrival at 
Brussels Airport," Arnaud Feist, who heads Brussels Airport Company, said in a press release.
Unlike in the Netherlands, people returning to Belgium from high-risk areas are required to undergo testing.

Passengers returning from high-risk areas are to be charged 47 euros (56 dollars) for the virus test.
Departing passengers can also be tested, but would pay higher fees. Those undergoing standard testing, with the 
results available some nine hours later, would pay 67 euros. Faster testing is also to be offered, with the results 
available in three hours, for 135 euros.
Charleroi Airport, Brussels' second airport with flights mainly offered by Ryanair and Wizzair, has not announced 
similar measures.
More and more airports are offering mobile testing for the virus. While some places such as Singapore introduced 
testing for passengers with symptoms as early as March, Germany started offering tests free of charge for 
passengers on Saturday.
While international flights ground to a halt in March and April, Europe's summer holiday season has seen an 
increase in air travel - and a corresponding rise in the number of cases.

Brussels Airport will introduce mobile labs for coronavirus tests for passengers at the beginning of September, it 
announced on Thursday.
Passengers returning from a red zone - countries or regions that Belgium deems to carry a high risk for coronavirus 
infections - will be able to get tested at the airport.
"There passengers returning from a red zone can be tested immediately upon arrival at Brussels Airport," Arnaud 
Feist, the boss of Brussels Airport Company, said in a press release.
The test for arriving passengers that must be tested will cost about 47 euros (56 dollars).
Departing passengers can also get tested, albeit at a higher cost: 67 euros for a standard test for which results will 
be available within about 9 hours, or 135 euros for a rapid test with results being available within 3 hours.
Charleroi Airport, Brussels second airport that caters mainly to Ryanair and Wizzair, has not announced similar 
measures.

are failing to keep promise to aviation watchdog to process passenger claims more quickly One-Minute Read[1] 
Mike Starling[2] Wednesday, August 12, 2020 - 10:41am Three major airlines are breaching pledges to the Civil 
Aviation Authority (CAA) to refund passengers for flights cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, 
according to a Which? investigation. In areport[3]in July,the industry regulator named and shamed Ryanair, Virgin 
Atlantic and Tui for 'not processing refund requests[4]sufficiently quickly' and 'having a sizeable backlog of refund 
requests'. But after 'brazenly breaking the law by forcing passengers to wait up to four months for their money 
back', the three carriers have failed to keep their promises to speed up the return of 'hundreds of thousands of 
pounds in refunds', says theDaily Mail[5].CAA 'needs more powers'The airlines promised the CAA that refunds 
would be issued within agreed timeframes, butWhich?
[6]found that claims are still taking months to process. The consumer group's travel editor, Rory Boland, is now 
calling on the government to give the industry watchdog 'the tools it needs to hold airlines to account, or risk 
consumer trust in the travel industry being damaged beyond repair'. 'Time after time, Which? has exposed airlines 
breaking the law on refunds for cancelled flights due to the pandemic and treating their passengers unfairly, and 
we're concerned that they now feel empowered to do as they please without fear of punishment,' Boland said. See 
related Holiday coronavirus cancellations: what are your rights on refunds?[7] Travel corridors: full list of quarantine-
free countries[8] Responding to the Which? probe findings, CAA spokespersonAndrew McConnell said: 'We will 
review any supplementary evidence that Which? wish to provide to us beyond the 12,000 cases previously 
submitted during our review of airline refund policies and performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. 'While our 
initial review has concluded, we have been clear that we will continue to monitor performance closely and should 
any airline fall short of the commitments they have made to us, we will take further action as required.'What have 
the airlines said?Ryanair told the BBC[9]that it had issued 670m in refunds and had cleared more than 90% of its 
claims backlog.Meanwhile, Virgin said it was 'very sorry'that a 'small number' of customers had to wait more than 
120 days for a refund. And'Tui said it now issued refunds automatically and normally processed cash refunds within 
two 
weeks'

broadcaster

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) is gearing up to enter Russia, having secured traffic rights from the Italian civil aviation 
authority (Ente Nazionale per L'aviazione Civile - ENAC) for 4x weekly flights from Italy to St. Petersburg starting 
during the Winter 2020/21 season. The relevant decision by ENAC's Air Transport Development and Licensing 
Department did not specify the Italian airports of origin. 
Ryanair has yet to formally confirm the plans. The Irish LCC does not currently serve Russia. Its rival Wizz Air (W6, 
Budapest) has recently announced plans to launch its first Russian base at St. Petersburg airport starting in 
September 2020. Meanwhile, easyJet Europe (EC, Vienna), which stopped flying to Russia in 2015, is planning to 
enter Ukraine, having also secured 12x weekly frequencies from ENAC, all of which are due to launch by the end of 
the current summer season. Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) also received traffic rights for 96x weekly flights from Italy to 
Ukraine, also due to launch in the current season, while Ryanair was authorised to operate 56x weekly flights from 
Italy to Ukraine, of which half has to launch by the end of the Summer 2020 season and the remainder in the 
upcoming winter season. According to the ch-aviation schedules module, Ryanair and Wizz Air already operate 
Italy-Ukraine routes (the former's flights are operated by its subsidiary Malta Air). easyJet Europe or its parent 
easyJet (U2, London Luton) do not currently serve Ukraine at all. Scheduled flights between these two countries are 
also operated by numerous Ukrainian airlines, namely Ukraine International Airlines, SkyUp Airlines, Windrose 
Airlines, and Jonika Airlines. Alitalia also flies to Kyiv Igor Sikorsky.

Ryanair has revealed its first quarter 2020 results have shown a net loss of (EURO)185 million. In comparison with 
a net profit of (EURO)243 million in the same period last year.
Ryanair says the Q2 of 2020 was the most challenging, the coronavirus pandemic hit has been harsh. Almost entire 
Ryanair Group's fleet was grounded for nearly four months, operating only special flights.
In July, Ryanair has operated approximately 40% of its normal schedule. For August, the carrier expects this to rise 
to 60% of its regular 2019 summer month schedule and in September rise to 70%. However, as for now the biggest 
fear is the second wave of the lockdowns amid the pandemic.
"It is impossible to predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will persist, and a 2nd wave of COVID-19 cases 
across Europe in late autumn (when the annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now," Ryanair said 
in a statement.
The operator predicts that 2021 could see its air traffic fall by 60%got the Ryanair Group.
Nevertheless, before the end of 2020, Ryanair hopes to take the first delivery of delayed Boeing 737 MAX 200 
aircraft. Boeing estimates its MAX program will return to service in the US in late 2020.

Ukrainian carrier SkyUp Airlines is broadening its international network from next month while at the same time 
planning to increase its market share at home.
Ukrainian carrier SkyUp Airlines is adding a 28th international destination from its Kiev Boryspil (KBP) base in 
September as it begins flights to Istanbul (IST).
The low-cost airline will provide a 3X-weekly service on board Boeing 737 aircraft-operating Mondays, 
Wednesdays and Fridays-from Sept. 25. SkyUp will become the third carrier to serve the route, in addition to 
Turkish Airlines and Ukraine International Airlines (UIA).
Turkey allowed Ukrainians to enter from July 1 without requiring a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test 
and self-isolation. However, passengers must have a health insurance policy that covers the costs of 
treating COVID-19 in Turkey.
According to data provided by Sabre Market Intelligence, the number of two-way passengers between Kiev and 
Istanbul totaled 580,726 in 2019, a rise of 3.6% on the previous 12 months.
On the Kiev to Istanbul leg, 25% of traffic was local, with the majority of passengers (58%) flying to destinations 
beyond the Turkish city.
SkyUp Airlines launched in 2018, operating charter flights on behalf of tour operators and scheduled services, 
predominantly to leisure destinations. Since restarting operations on June 26, the LCC has been gradually 
increasing its operations in Ukraine and internationally.
New domestic routes added since the resumption include KBP-Odesa (ODS) and services from Lviv (LWO) to ODS 
and Kherson (KHE).
Under the guidance of new acting CEO Dmytro Seroukhov, the airline said it wants to increase its share of the 
domestic market to 50% over the next five years and increase its fleet by between five and seven aircraft by 2022. 
According to Aviation Week Fleet and Data Services, SkyUp has a fleet of 10 Boeing 737s and has orders for up to 
seven 737 MAX.
SkyUp to launch Turkish route, seeks larger domestic share
OAG Schedules Analyser data shows the airline's domestic capacity share was 3.6% in 2019, with UIA 
commanding 82.3% of the market.
However, Ukraine's government last year laid out an action plan to grow the share of low-cost routes in the country, 
increasing the proportion from 38% to 63% by 2024.
Ryanair and Wizz Air have been the main movers since then, particularly on routes to Italy. Ryanair is planning to 
launch 16 new routes between Ukraine and Italy as part of its winter 2020-21 and summer 2021 schedules, and 
Wizz is opening 14 new routes by April 2021. Wizz has also opened a new base at LWO.

domestic market to 50% over the next five years and increase its fleet by between five and seven aircraft by 2022.

seven 737 MAX.

OAG Schedules Analyser data shows the airline's domestic capacity share was 3.6% in 2019, with UIA 
commanding 82.3% of the market.
However, Ukraine's government last year laid out an action plan to grow the share of low-cost routes in the country, 
increasing the proportion from 38% to 63% by 2024.
Ryanair and Wizz Air have been the main movers since then, particularly on routes to Italy. Ryanair is planning to

Wizz is opening 14 new routes by April 2021. Wizz has also opened a new base at LWO.

Ukrainian carrier SkyUp Airlines is broadening its international network from next month while at the same time 
planning to increase its market share at home.
Ukrainian carrier SkyUp Airlines is adding a 28th international destination from its Kiev Boryspil (KBP) base in 
September as it begins flights to Istanbul (IST).
The low-cost airline will provide a 3X-weekly service on board Boeing 737 aircraft-operating Mondays, 
Wednesdays and Fridays-from Sept. 25. SkyUp will become the third carrier to serve the route, in addition to 
Turkish Airlines and Ukraine International Airlines (UIA).
Turkey allowed Ukrainians to enter from July 1 without requiring a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test 
and self-isolation. However, passengers must have a health insurance policy that covers the costs of 
treating COVID-19 in Turkey.
According to data provided by Sabre Market Intelligence, the number of two-way passengers between Kiev and 
Istanbul totaled 580,726 in 2019, a rise of 3.6% on the previous 12 months.
On the Kiev to Istanbul leg, 25% of traffic was local, with the majority of passengers (58%) flying to destinations 
beyond the Turkish city.
SkyUp Airlines launched in 2018, operating charter flights on behalf of tour operators and scheduled services, 
predominantly to leisure destinations. Since restarting operations on June 26, the LCC has been gradually 
increasing its operations in Ukraine and internationally.
New domestic routes added since the resumption include KBP-Odesa (ODS) and services from Lviv (LWO) to ODS 
and Kherson (KHE).
Under the guidance of new acting CEO Dmytro Seroukhov, the airline said it wants to increase its share of the 
domestic market to 50% over the next five years and increase its fleet by between five and seven aircraft by 2022.

Ryanair increases capacity, rebuffs Italy flight ban threat

Ryanair said it intends to fly more than 1,600 routes this month as passenger numbers continue to grow while 
dismissing claims from Italy's civil aviation authority that is it failing to follow coronavirus rules on services to the 
country.
Ryanair will increase flights to more than 60% of its normal schedule throughout August following the "successful 
resumption" of services at the end of June.
Passenger figures totaled 4.4 million in July with capacity at about 40%. The group had offered 6.5 million seats 
across its network of ULCC carriers for the month, data provided by OAG Schedules Analyser shows, compared 
with 15.1 million during July 2019.
The passenger figure for July 2020 was 70% down on the same month last year when 14.8 million passengers 
boarded a Ryanair flight.
During August, Ryanair intends to fly more than 1,600 routes and in excess of 11,000 weekly flights. The latest 
schedules suggest about 10.8 million seats are on offer, which would be the equivalent to around 70% of August 
2019's capacity, although operations are still subject to change amid ongoing COVID-19-related travel restrictions.
"Since the resumption of our schedule in late June, passenger numbers have continued to grow and as a result, 
we're delighted to announce that our flight schedule is set to increase to more than 60% in August," Ryanair CEO 
Eddie Wilson said.
Earlier this week rival Wizz Air said it carried 1.8 million passengers in July and offered 74% of its normal capacity, 
while easyJet flew "just over" 2 million passengers last month.
Ryanair's planned capacity increase during August comes as Italy's civil aviation authority ENAC threatened to 
suspend the airline's permit to fly to the country citing non-compliance with COVID-19 safety regulations. ENAC 
claimed that Ryanair "systematically fails" to observe measures designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
The organisation has therefore written to the airline, warning that if "violations of the rules" continue it could limit 
Ryanair's aircraft capacity to 50% on Italian routes or else "impose the suspension of all air transport activities at 
national airports."
Ryanair increases capacity, rebuffs Italy flight ban threat
In a statement, Ryanair rebuffed the allegations, saying the claims made by ENAC are "factually incorrect" and 
insisted it is "committed to the highest level of safety for our passengers and crew at all times."
"Ryanair complies fully with the measures set out by the Italian government and our customers can rest assured 
that we are doing everything to reduce interaction on both our aircraft and at airports to protect the health of our 
passengers," the statement said.

 The Italian Civil Aviation Authority Enac reportedly warned Ryanair (RYAAY) that it may suspend its flights to and 
from Italy over allegations that it is continuing to breach COVID-19 safety measures, according to media reports 
from late Wednesday. 
The regulator warned that it could withdraw the allowed partial repeal from COVID-19 rules, forcing Ryanair to sell 
only 50% of seats on its planes, The Irish Times reported Wednesday.
The Irish budget airline, however, said in a statement published by a number of media outlets that the claims are 
"factually incorrect" and that it is in full compliance with all anti-virus regulations introduced by the Italian 
government.

Ryanair will increase flights to over 60% of its normal schedule throughout August following what it said on 
Thursday was a successful resumption of services at 40% of capacity last month following COVID-19 lockdowns.
Europe's biggest budget airline flew 4.4 million passengers in July, a broadly expected 70% year-on-year fall. It 
slashed its target for the financial year to March 2021 to 60 million passengers last month, from the 80 million 
forecast in May.
"Since the resumption of our schedule in late June, passenger numbers have continued to grow," Eddie Wilson, 
chief executive of Ryanair's main airline unit, said in a statement, saying traveller confidence was returning.

Aug 06, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Italy's civil aviation regulator ENAC 
is threatening to ban Ryanair from the country's airports due to non-compliance with rules aimed at tackling the 
coronavirus pandemic. The regulator accused the airline of 'repeated violation' of anti-Covid-19 health measures 
drafted by the Italian government and in force to protect passengers' health. It warned that if 'violations of the rules' 
continue it could prevent Ryanair from flying to or from Italy. Airlines operating in Italy are not required to ensure 
social distancing of one metre if other safety steps such as mandatory wearing of face masks are taken, but ENAC 
said Ryanair is failing to meet these requirements. In a statement, Ryanair rejected the claims as incorrect, and 
insisted it is 'committed to the highest level of safety for our passengers and crew at all times'. The airline restarted 
flying 40% of its schedules[1] across Europe a month ago. 'Ryanair complies fully with the measures set out by the 
Italian government and our customers can rest assured that we are doing everything to reduce interaction on both 
our aircraft and at airports to protect the health of our passengers when flying Ryanair,' the airline said. [ 1]:

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has launched legal proceedings against the Irish prime minister and the state at the High 
Court in Dublin in an effort to ease the travel "restrictions" put in place for all but 15 countries, the airline said on 
July 31. The Irish carrier claims that the limitations are detrimental to its business and continue to be imposed even 
though the situation in Europe, its main market, is improving. This makes the restrictions unlawful, interfering with 
consumers' rights, it said. The Irish government's green list of countries, for which a 14-day quarantine requirement 
does not apply, is "ineffective", it added. 
The list allows unrestricted travel to some Ryanair destinations, such as Greece and Italy, but not others, such as 
Great Britain, France, and Spain. "We have now cut ourselves off from the largest economies in Europe, Germany, 
France, the UK, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, and telling them that Ireland is closed for business," 
Ryanair argued in a submission to the Irish parliament's Special Committee on Covid-19 Response in late July. 
According to the Irish Independent, Ryanair will seek a judicial review stating that the list was not approved in the 
country's legislation and has not been debated in the parliament. Aer Lingus parent IAG International Airlines Group 
has joined the legal proceedings as a notice party, which means it could be heard in court, chief executive Willie 
Walsh told the Irish broadcaster RTÉ. Speaking in a conference call to reporters last week, Walsh was highly critical 
of the Irish government's travel advice, saying that people should not have to self-isolate for 14 days just because 
they have been flying. Government advice should be "more targetted" and "more balanced", he opined, instead of 
being "more extreme than in other parts of the world".

(ANSA) - 05 AGO - The health ministry said Wednesday that Italy has registered 384 new coronavirus cases in the 
last 24 hours. That is a big rise with respect to the 190 new cases reported on Tuesday. Only one region did not 
register any new cases, Valle d'Aosta. 
The ministry said 10 COVID-19 sufferers have died here in the last 24 hours, twice as many as on Tuesday. Italy's 
coronavirus death toll now stands at 35,181. The number of people currently positive for COVID-19 here is 12,646 
(up 164 on Tuesday). So far 200,976 people have recovered (up 210). The total number of registered cases in Italy, 
including the deceased, the recovered and the currently positive, is 248,803. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the 
Director-General of the World Health Organization, said Wednesday that other countries are learning from how Italy 
has tackled the coronavirus. "Grazie mille @robersperanza, #Italy Health Minister, for a very good call and for your 
strong support to @WHO," Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented as he retweeted a post by Italian Health Minister 
Roberto Speranza. "Your leadership and humility is inspiring to other countries who are learning from and acting on 
Italy's experience". Italy was the first European country to be badly hit by the pandemic. It imposed tough lockdown 
measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the nation's health service being overwhelmed. Although 
those moves seemed draconian at the time, they were subsequently copied by other States. Italy also adopted a 
prudent approach after bringing the contagion curve down, easing the lockdown measures gradually. Some 
restrictions still apply and people must wear facemasks in enclosed spaces, such as shops and on public transport, 
and maintain social distancing of at least one metre. Italian civil aviation authority ENAC, meanwhile, has written to 
Ryanair threatening to suspend it from using Italy's airports for failing to respect rules aimed at preventing 
coronavirus contagion. ENAC also informed its Irish counterpart about the "repeated violation of anti-COVID-19 
health measures drafted by the Italian government and in force to protect passengers' health". It said that, if the 
company does not rectify the situation, it will impose "the suspension of all air-transport activity in national airports". 
Airlines are exempted from running at 50% of capacity to ensure social distancing of one metre only if they respect 
a series of other rules and ENAC said Ryanair is failing to do this. ENAC said the rules include the obligation to 
wear facemask during flights , adding that it is the airlines' responsibility to ensure the rules are respected on board 
aircraft.

On the up EasyJet adds to flights as demand soars

EasyJet is increasing the number of flights over the summer following higher passenger demand despite concerns 
over a new surge of coronavirus infections across Europe.
The low-cost airline plans to fly 40 per cent of last year's capacity in the three months to the end of September, up 
from its forecast of 30 per cent.
The move helped propel shares 8.8 per cent higher to 551.60p yesterday. Its stock has fallen about 60 per cent this 
year as holidaymakers have shunned air travel.
The FTSE 250 group generated just £7m in revenue for the quarter ending on June 30, a collapse of 99 per cent 
from the £1.8bn recorded during the same time in 2019. It operated 709 flights against 165,656 last year.
EasyJet has been more cautious than some of its low-cost rivals over restoring flights. Ryanair plans to fly about 60 
per cent of its capacity in August and 70 per cent in September. In July, the Irish budget carrier flew 40 per cent of 
its capacity with planes about 72 per cent full. In comparison, easyJet has enjoyed higher load factors, with its 
planes about 84 per cent full. But the group cautioned about an uncertain outlook as the winter months are typically 
lossmaking for the industry even in normal times. Tanya Powley and Sarah Provan Remko De Waal/EPA-

national airports, requiring the carrier to re-route all passengers already in possession of tickets".Italy was the first 
European Union country to be seriously affected by the pandemic, which has officially killed over 35,000, but its 
contagion rate is currently far below levels seen in other parts of the bloc.

Aug 05, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Italy's 
national civil aviation authority ENAC threatened on Wednesday to suspend Ryanair's permit to fly in the country 
over alleged non-compliance with coronavirus safety rules. It accused the Irish low-cost airline of "repeated 
violations of the COVID-19 health regulations currently in force and imposed by the Italian government to protect 
the health of passengers"."Not only is the obligation to distance passengers not respected, but the conditions for 
making an exception to that rule are also being ignored", it said in a statement. If Ryanair continued to break the 
rules ENAC would "suspend all air transport activities at national airports, requiring the carrier to re-route all 
passengers already in possession of tickets". Italy was the first European Union country to be seriously affected by

Aug 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, 
Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[1], Gol Linhas GOL[2] and SkyWest SKYW[3] reported losses in second-quarter 
2020 results. This underperformance was due to weak passenger revenues as air-travel demand remains subdued 
in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Notably, leading carriers like American Airlines AAL[4] and Southwest 
Airlines LUV[5] also put up a dismal show when it released second-quarter financial numbers in the previous 
week[6].Earnings announcement apart, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings' RYAAY[7] traffic data grabbed 
headlines over the past five trading days. Moreover, per a Reuters report[8], U.S. airlines are seeking a six-month 
extension of the payroll support program as the desired rebound in air travel does not seem a near-term possibility. 
Summary of the Past Week's Top Stories 1. Allegiant Travel's second-quarter 2020 loss of $5.96 per share 
(excluding 11 cents from non-recurring items) was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $4.53. 
However, the company reported earnings of $4.33 per share in the year-ago quarter when air-travel demand was 
strong. Meanwhile, with the advent of coronavirus, the same plummeted and hurt second-quarter 2020 results. 
Moreover, quarterly revenues of $133.3 million plunged 72.9% year over year due to soft passenger 
revenues[9].Allegiant Travel presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's 
Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[10]2. Gol Linhas incurred a loss (excluding $1.27 from non-recurring 
items) of 81 cents per share in the second quarter of 2020, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss 
of $1.1. However, net operating revenues of $66.7 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $152.9 million 
and also declined year over year. Further, passenger revenues tanked 91.8% on a year-over-year basis due to 
muted air-travel demand amid coronavirus concerns. The company expects to have liquidity of R$2.9 billion at the 
end of the third quarter. Adjusted net debt is estimated to be R$13.8 billion[11] as of the same period.3. SkyWest's 
second-quarter 2020 loss of 51 cent per share was worse than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a couple 
of cents. Moreover, quarterly revenues of $350 million tumbled 53% year over year and missed the Zacks 
Consensus Estimate of $352.4 million as well. The COVID-19 outbreak caused a significant reduction in the 
number of scheduled flights[12], thereby hurting the top line.4. Ryanair Holdings posted bland traffic statistics for 
July, primarily due to bleak air-travel demand, stemming from the COVID-19 crisis. This Irish carrier reported a 70% 
year-over-year slump in last month's traffic to merely 4.4 million passengers. Ryanair operated approximately 40% 
of the normal July schedule with a load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) of 72%. On a rolling annual basis, 
total traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) dropped 35% to 96.8 million.5. With air-travel demand again

drooping following the spike in coronavirus cases across some parts of the United States, United Airlines UAL[13] 
warned that it may have to furlough more pilots than the original plan of 2,250, per a CNBC report[14]. Spirit Airlines 
SAVE[15] too followed suit, having sent notices to its unions about the possibility of some of its pilots, flight 
attendants and other employees getting furloughed in October. Notably, the financial aid under the CARES act 
protects jobs at the airlines only through Sep 30, 2020. Naturally, airlines are planning to extend the period. 
Performance The following table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and during 
the past six months. The table above shows that the airline stocks have exhibited a mixed trend with respect to 
price performance in the past week. The NYSE ARCA Airline Index has declined marginally to $51.22. Over the 
course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has plummeted 53.6%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? Investors will keenly await the updates on airlines' efforts to gain an extension of the U.S. payroll support 
program beyond Sep 30. Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation Be among the early investors in the new type 
of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon 
be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it's expected to create 22 million jobs and generate 
$12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early 
investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks' just-released special report reveals 8 
stocks to watch. The report is only available for a limited time.See 8 breakthrough stocks now > >

Aug 05, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted bland traffic numbers for July, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. This Irish carrier reported a 70% year-over-year plunge in July traffic to 4.4 million 
passengers.Ryanair operated approximately 40% of the normal July schedule with a load factor (% of seats filled

35% to 96.8 million. Ryanair Holdings PLC Price https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/RYAAY/price?icid=chart-
RYAAY-fundamental/price Ryanair Holdings PLC price[2] | Ryanair Holdings PLC Quote[3]Apart from the traffic 
results, Ryanair was in the news recently when it reported first-quarter fiscal 2021 (ended Jun 30, 2020) financials. 
The company incurred a loss of 93 cents per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 (ended Jun 30, 2020). As was 
the case with the traffic report, dismal air-travel demand hurt quarterly results. Notably, the carrier regarded the 
fiscal first-quarter as the most challenging in its 35 years of history with EU governments' travel restrictions and 
lockdowns across several nations. More than 99% of the airline's fleet was grounded from mid-March to June-end. 
Quarterly revenues of $137.8 million plunged 94.7% year over year due to massive decline in traffic.Ryanair flying 
schedules are expected to increase in the coming months, with the airline hoping to operate 60% of the usual 
schedule in August and 70% in September. Zacks Rank &#38; Key Picks Ryanair, currently carries a Zacks Rank 
#3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[4]Better-ranked stocks 
in the Zacks Transportation [5]sector are C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. CHRW[6], Werner Enterprises, Inc. 
WERN[7] and United Parcel Service, Inc. UPS[8], all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Long-term earnings (three to five

Ryanair to fight Irish travel restrictions in court
Ryanair to fight Irish travel restrictions in court

Ryanair has initiated legal proceedings against Ireland, questioning the legality of travel restrictions that have kept a 
quarantine policy in place for all but 15 countries, the airline said on Friday.
The Irish carrier, Europe's largest budget airline, said it had begun the action to challenge what it described as the 
Irish government's "ineffective" green list of countries, for which a 14-day quarantine requirement does not apply.
Ireland has taken a more cautious approach to reopening its economy and skies than many European countries. 
The green list, announced on July 22, contained some popular destinations Ryanair flies to, such as Italy and 
Greece, but not others including Britain, France and Spain.
This list is due to be reviewed next week and is unlikely to be enlarged.
Asked about reports of a potential challenge by Ryanair on Sunday, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar said the government 
would wait to see what case the airline made but that the advice from the authorities on travel was clear.
The Irish Independent newspaper reported that Ryanair would seek a judicial review and argue the list was not 
provided for in legislation and parliament was denied the opportunity to scrutinise it when it was put in place by way 
of public announcement.
IAG, which owns Irish airline Aer Lingus, has joined as a notice party to the proceedings, meaning it could be heard 
in court argument, chief executive Willie Walsh told Irish national broadcaster RTE.
Irishman Walsh said he understand the need for the measures, but was challenging its blanket application.
Ryanair to fight Irish travel restrictions in court
Ryanair, IAG and easyJet launched a similar challenge against the British government last month, but said they 
would end the action after London scrapped its 14-day quarantine rule for travellers coming from some of the most 
popular tourist destinations.
Ryanair flew 4.4 million passengers in July, a broadly expected 70% year-on-year fall after it operated around 40% 
of its normal July schedule with a 72% load factor, a measure of how well an airline fills its available seats.
Europe's biggest budget airline returned to a more regular schedule following the COVID-19 lockdown on July 1 
when it said it expected to fly more than 4.5 million passengers during the first month back in the sky.
The Irish airline cut its annual passenger target by a quarter last week and warned a second wave of COVID-19 
infections could lower that further. (Reuters)

Hungary 's Wizz Air briefly banned in Greece over COVID rules

The Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority (HCAA) in Greece briefly banned Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) from landing at 
Athens Int'l airport on August 1 due to the carrier's alleged non-compliance with procedures for collecting 
Passenger Locator Forms before boarding. The dispute was resolved shortly thereafter and Wizz Air said that the 
ban, initially imposed through August 14, was lifted on August 2. There is no NOTAM in force preventing the carrier 
from landing in Greece or specifically in Athens. The low-cost carrier said it had asked its passengers to correctly fill 
in the forms and make sure they are collected. 
The measure was implemented on July 24 to improve the traceability of potential COVID-19 cases in the country 
without undermining its crucial tourism sector. All passengers have to register on the Greek government's website 
the day before departure and complete the appropriate form. Airlines are responsible for only allowing passengers 
with proof of their registration on board. Passengers lacking the requisite registration will not be allowed into Greece 
with the airline having to bear the cost of their repatriation. According to the ch-aviation capacities module, Wizz Air 
together with Wizz Air UK (W9, London Luton) is currently the fourth-largest airline in Greece in terms of 
international connectivity with a 4.3% market share by capacity on international routes and 22,252 departure seats 
in the week starting on August 3. Only Aegean Airlines with Olympic Air, Ryanair, and easyJet with easyJet Europe 
have larger shares of the market.

Recovery Tracker: Global capacity creeps above 50%

Weekly scheduled airline capacity has risen to more than half of the level recorded this time in 2019-although the 
pace of recovery is differing from region to region.
The number of scheduled seats being offered by airlines across the world will top 60 million this week (w/c Aug. 3) 
for the first time in four months, meaning global capacity is now at 50% of the level achieved in 2019.
Analysis of data provided by OAG Schedules Analyser shows 60,042,355 weekly seats scheduled, more than half 
of the 118,998,100 available seats during the same week a year ago.
The last time the year-on-year figure exceeded the 50% mark came during the fourth week of March as the COVID-
19 crisis was deepening with carriers quickly slashing capacity.
Overall, global capacity this week is 4.4% higher than during the previous seven days and 21% higher than during 
the first week of July. However, the pace of recovery is varying from region to region.
The infographic below shows the number of scheduled seats by region since the start of the year, highlighting that 
growth has largely plateaued in many areas in recent weeks, apart from in Europe which continues on an upward 
trend.
Europe has emerged as the key growth region thanks to the easing of travel restrictions and resumption of service 
in July by several large carriers, including Ryanair and easyJet.
The number of scheduled departure seats from and within Europe is on course to increase by 12.6% this week to 
15.1 million seats, up from 13.4 million last week. Western Europe will account for 12 million of the total, with 3.1 
million in Central and Eastern Europe.
However, while Europe's market has expanded by nearly 50% since the beginning of July, the speed of growth in 
other regions has been slower. After large capacity gains in June, North America recorded the lowest growth 
between w/c July 6 and w/c Aug. 3-of 7.2%-while fewer than 400,000 departure seats were added in Latin America 
over the same period.
Looking at the year-on-year change, North East Asia's market has recovered the quickest. Capacity is now 76.9% 
compared with the same week a year ago.
Recovery Tracker: Global capacity creeps above 50%
Central and Eastern Europe's market has recovered to 58.1% of this time last year, while North America's is 49.1%. 
Central America and Western Europe complete the top five.
At the bottom end of the scale, upper South America's market is only 12.7% of the size it was a year ago. This 
week there are just 227,309 departure seats, compared with 1.78 million during the same week in 2019.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) launched legal proceedings against the Irish government over the so-called green list of 
countries, for which a 14-day quarantine does not apply, according to a Reuters report late Friday. 
The Irish budget airline aims to challenge the legality of what it described as an "ineffective" policy amid the COVID-
19 pandemic, the report said.
On June 22, Ireland unveiled a 'green list' of countries, which excludes Britain, France and Spain but includes other 
popular holiday destinations such as Italy and Greece, the report said, adding that Ireland is due to review the list 
this week without making any changes.

BA parent launches emergency rights issue; Airlines ; IAG posts quarterly 
loss of more than (EURO)2bn as Covid-19 savages sector

British Airways owner International Airlines Group has launched a (EURO)2.75bn emergency fundraising, 
supported by its biggest shareholder Qatar Airways, to see it through the Covid-19 pandemic that has thrust the 
industry into crisis.
The group confirmed the rights issue, which it said it was considering last week, as it unveiled a second-quarter loss 
for the three months to the end of June of more than (EURO)2bn after its passenger business collapsed.
Willie Walsh, chief executive at IAG, said the group had lost more in this quarter than it had ever lost in a year and 
faced "an unprecedented crisis".
"Anybody who thinks these are shortterm issues and challenges that can be resolved by short-term measures, I 
think fails to understand the scale of the challenge," he said.
The news drove IAG shares down 6 per cent to 171p - their lowest since 2012 - by the close yesterday. The stock 
has lost about 60 per cent of its value in the past 12 months. IAG, which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, 
has already announced plans to cut up to 12,000 jobs at BA as well as retire its entire fleet of 31 Boeing 747 jumbo 
jets because of the travel downturn.
BA parent launches emergency rights issue Airlines ; IAG posts quarterly loss of more than (EURO)2bn as 
Covid-19 savages sector
The slower recovery faced by network carriers such as IAG was highlighted by the group downgrading its 
passenger capacity outlook for the peak summer months - July, August and September - to just 26 per cent of last 
year's levels, compared with its previous plan to fly about 45 per cent.
Mr Walsh said the move was down to uncertainty over travel restrictions in light of a new surge of coronavirus 
infections across Europe and elsewhere. He pointed to the recent decision by the UK government to reimpose a 14-
day quarantine on travellers from Spain after the country reported a rise in infections in some regions.
He said airlines such as BA, which has about 80 per cent of its capacity in longhaul flying, would face a greater 
challenge compared with budget rivals such as Ryanair and easyJet, as long-haul and business travel take longer 
to recover than short-haul leisure flying.
The group said passenger traffic fell 98 per cent in the second quarter because it was "only able to operate a 
skeleton passenger schedule". It does not expect the aviation industry to recovery until at least 2023.
The second-quarter operating loss included roughly (EURO)812m of exceptional costs relating to impairment of 
IAG's aircraft fleet. The group had posted a profit of (EURO)960m for the same quarter last year.
In a separate announcement, IAG announced that Spanish executive Javier Ferrán will become its new chairman in 
January, replacing the long-serving Antonio Vázquez.

Lauda Europe seeks Maltese AOC
Lauda Europe seeks Maltese AOC

Body
A new subsidiary of the Ryanair group called Lauda Europe has applied for an air operator's certificate (AOC) in 
Malta.
The new airline will commence operations in November this year and will operate all the Airbus wetlease services 
for the Ryanair group, Malta's transport authority said.
If the application is approved the airline would be the second Ryanair group entity to secure a Maltese AOC after 
Malta Air, which has a fleet of 120 aircraft.
The Austrian Wings website has reported that Ryanair intends to dissolve the Austrian-based Lauda operation and 
replace it with Lauda Europe.
Lauda has suffered losses since its acquisition by the Ryanair group amid tough competition at its Vienna base with 
other low-cost carriers such as Wizz Air and Level.
In its first-quarter results, Ryanair said Lauda had been forced to implement "a deep and painful rescue plan", which 
involved cutting the fleet from 38 to 30 aircraft in summer 2020 and substantially reducing headcount numbers in 
Vienna and Germany while closing its three-aircraft Stuttgart base.
A plan to close its Vienna base was reversed after the airline implemented these cuts.
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment.

Having posted a EUR185 million euro (USD218 million) net loss in the second quarter of 2020 with a 99% drop in 
the number of passengers flown, Ryanair Holdings is currently evaluating the closure of more bases where 
negotiations with labour unions have not produced a favourable outcome, Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary 
said during a quarterly earnings call. "In Ryanair, we have been unsuccessful in persuading German pilots to agree 
to pay cuts. So we've announced the closure of Stuttgart Manfred Rommel, Berlin Tegel, Düsseldorf Weeze, and 
Frankfurt Hahn. 
At the end of the summer schedule, Lauda is closing its Stuttgart base. We're also looking, I think, at some base 
closures in Spain, where at the moment the unions have not yet agreed to the pay cuts we need," O'Leary said. He 
added that there it was "inevitable" there would be some base closures in Italy, where he blamed both the unions 
and the government, which was, allegedly, "trying to impose Alitalia's pay rates and business productivity on other 
airlines and other airports". At the end of the second quarter of 2020, Ryanair Group had 79 bases across Europe 
and North Africa. Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan underlined that the group would also be shifting an increasing 
amount of operations to its subsidiaries - Buzz (RR, Warsaw Modlin) in Central/Eastern Europe and Malta Air (AL, 
Malta Int'l) in other markets. Both airlines will be increasing their fleets, which they operate on behalf of Ryanair. 
O'Leary admitted that Buzz's development had also been affected by the closure of some key charter markets, such 
as Turkey, given that the airline also operates leisure charters besides scheduled flights. "They clearly had a 
difficult first quarter on the back of the groundings. Buzz, at the moment, has just under 50 aircraft in its fleet and 
continues to take over operations for the Ryanair Group in Central and Eastern Europe, and we hope to take on a 
couple more bases this winter... Malta Air now has 120 B737s in its fleet, and it is actively involved in cost 
negotiations with its people across the various markets that we operate in. And we would, again, hope that Malta Air 
will take on more of our operations over the coming years and months," Sorahan said.

TANYA POWLEY AND PEGGY HOLLINGER LONDON MICHAEL PEEL - BRUSSELS As airlines rush to return 
their fleets to the skies, the industry is battling to restore confidence among travellers that flying in an enclosed 
aircraft with hundreds of people is not as risky as it may seem.
Over the past month the aviation industry - from carriers, to aircraft manufacturers, to airports - has stepped up its 
campaign to address safety concerns about the spread of coronavirus as it looks to recover from the worst crisis in 
its 100-year history.
"All the data we can look at tells us that aeroplanes are less of a risk than any equivalent public place [such as] bus, 
train, restaurant or a workplace," said David Powell, medical adviser at Iata, the airline global trade body.
But he admitted the sector faced a "widespread perception that airliners are a dangerous place".
The fear stems from aircraft being confined spaces where people, sometimes from different countries, are close to 
each other for long periods, all factors that increase the danger of catching coronavirus, according to scientific 
studies.
Air travel sector struggles to take off again Risk analysis. Passenger fears ; Holidaymakers and business 
customers remain worried about sitting in confined spa....
An industry-commissioned survey of 4,700 air travellers highlighted this concern. According to Iata, 65 per cent of 
those interviewed said their biggest concern was sitting next to someone who might be infected. About 42 per cent 
listed using the toilet, while 37 per cent said they were worried about breathing the air in the plane.
But experts point out that the distinctive features of aircraft ventilation systems could reduce the hazards. The 
"replacement rate" - the number of times a volume of air equivalent to the volume of the cabin is removed each 
hour - is very brisk.
While this does not mean every gas molecule in the environment is removed every few minutes, the airflow it 
creates potentially reduces significantly the risk of exposure to high virus concentrations over long periods.
Another crucial factor is that air recirculated through the aircraft cabin goes through air-conditioning systems with far 
more sophisticated and effective filters than those generally found in indoor venues on the ground.
These filters have been found in previous studies to remove almost all particles of the typical size of coronavirus. 
Both Airbus and Boeing have advised airlines to keep the ventilation system running when passengers are boarding 
and disembarking to minimise the risk further, a practice not widespread before Covid-19.
Other factors could also lessen virus transmission. Seat-backs help block the path of respiratory droplets exhaled 
through mouths and noses. Passengers also tend to stay in their seats and not spend long periods in different parts 
of the cabin, reducing the risk that they will spread the pathogen to multiple groups of people.
Some airlines, such as Ryanair, have said passengers will need to ask permission to use the toilet. Many have cut 
food and drink to limit interaction between crew and passengers.
So far there has been little evidence of in-flight transmission of coronavirus. A flight from the US to Taiwan in 
March, where 12 people were later confirmed to have been symptomatic at the time of flight, generated no 
secondary confirmed cases among the 328 other passengers and crew members.
In a survey of 18 airlines, Iata found that in January to March there were just four episodes of suspected in-flight 
transmission of Covid-19, all from passenger to crew, and a further four episodes of apparent transmission from 
pilot to pilot.
A more in-depth survey of four carrihas ers, which looked at flights carrying about 125,000 passengers - of whom 
1,100 were identified as confirmed cases - identified one possible secondary passenger case and two crew cases.
However, there are exceptions. An investigation into a flight from the UK to Vietnam in March suggested one 
passenger infected up to 14 others, 12 of whom were seated nearby.
Jim Haas, director of product marketing at Boeing, said that while there had been a "few" cases of potential 
onboard transmission, in the context of the thousands of flights this year the risk was still low.
But scientists say the evidence on aircraft coronavirus transmission is still thin and it is possible studies will emerge 
that flag more concerns.
While social distancing on an aircraft would reduce the risk of transmission further, according to scientists, there are 
few carriers, apart from some in the US, that are planning to leave middle seats empty because it would mean they 
would struggle to turn a profit. There also been no requirement by aviation authorities to make social distancing 
mandatory on board.
Airlines have introduced other safety measures, such as mandatory face masks for passengers and crew, 
enhanced cabin cleaning and changing boarding and in-flight processes to reduce interpersonal contact.
Aircraft manufacturers are also investigating other ways to improve safety. Boeing is looking at new materials such 
as antimicrobial coatings or surfaces that would kill any virus that lands on them.

customers remain worried about sitting in confined spa....
It is also developing a portable ultraviolet disinfector that Mr Haas said could be available "in a year or so". 
Designed as a backpack with a handheld UV wand, airline staff could wave the light over the area to be disinfected 
and any virus would be killed "in seconds".
Julian Tang, a consultant virologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said that because of the effectiveness of the 
aircraft's ventilation system, the risk really came from how close people are when they are talking to cabin crew or 
to each other. He said there were small things passengers could do to limit their exposure.

As airlines rush to return their fleets to the skies, the industry is battling to restore confidence among travellers that 
flying in an enclosed aircraft with hundreds of people is not as risky as it may seem.
Over the past month the aviation industry - from carriers, to aircraft manufacturers, to airports - has stepped up its 
campaign to address safety concerns about the spread of coronavirus as it looks to recover from the worst crisis in 
its 100-year history.
"All the data we can look at tells us that aeroplanes are less of a risk than any equivalent public place [such as] bus, 
train, restaurant or a workplace," said David Powell, medical adviser at Iata, the airline global trade body.
But he admitted the sector faced a "widespread perception that airliners are a dangerous place".
The fear stems from aircraft being confined spaces where people, sometimes from different countries, are close to 
each other for long periods, all factors that increase the danger of catching coronavirus, according to scientific 
studies.
Air travel sector struggles to take off again; Risk analysis. Passenger fearsHolidaymakers and business 
customers remain worried about sitting in confined space....
An industry-commissioned survey of 4,700 air travellers highlighted this concern. According to Iata, 65 per cent of 
those interviewed said their biggest concern was sitting next to someone who might be infected. About 42 per cent 
listed using the toilet, while 37 per cent said they were worried about breathing the air in the plane.
But experts point out that the distinctive features of aircraft ventilation systems could reduce the hazards. The 
"replacement rate" - the number of times a volume of air equivalent to the volume of the cabin is removed each 
hour - is very brisk.
While this does not mean every gas molecule in the environment is removed every few minutes, the airflow it 
creates potentially reduces significantly the risk of exposure to high virus concentrations over long periods.
Another crucial factor is that air recirculated through the aircraft cabin goes through air-conditioning systems with far 
more sophisticated and effective filters than those generally found in indoor venues on the ground.
These filters have been found in previous studies to remove almost all particles of the typical size of coronavirus. 
Both Airbus and Boeing have advised airlines to keep the ventilation system running when passengers are boarding 
and disembarking to minimise the risk further, a practice not widespread before Covid-19.
Other factors could also lessen virus transmission. Seat-backs help block the path of respiratory droplets exhaled 
through mouths and noses. Passengers also tend to stay in their seats and not spend long periods in different parts 
of the cabin, reducing the risk that they will spread the pathogen to multiple groups of people.
Some airlines, such as Ryanair, have said passengers will need to ask permission to use the toilet. Many have cut 
food and drink to limit interaction between crew and passengers.
So far there has been little evidence of in-flight transmission of coronavirus. A flight from the US to Taiwan in 
March, where 12 people were later confirmed to have been symptomatic at the time of flight, generated no 
secondary confirmed cases among the 328 other passengers and crew members.
In a survey of 18 airlines, Iata found that in January to March there were just four episodes of suspected in-flight 
transmission of Covid-19, all from passenger to crew, and a further four episodes of apparent transmission from 
pilot to pilot.
A more in-depth survey of four carrihas ers, which looked at flights carrying about 125,000 passengers - of whom 
1,100 were identified as confirmed cases - identified one possible secondary passenger case and two crew cases.
However, there are exceptions. An investigation into a flight from the UK to Vietnam in March suggested one 
passenger infected up to 14 others, 12 of whom were seated nearby.
Jim Haas, director of product marketing at Boeing, said that while there had been a "few" cases of potential 
onboard transmission, in the context of the thousands of flights this year the risk was still low.
But scientists say the evidence on aircraft coronavirus transmission is still thin and it is possible studies will emerge 
that flag more concerns.
While social distancing on an aircraft would reduce the risk of transmission further, according to scientists, there are 
few carriers, apart from some in the US, that are planning to leave middle seats empty because it would mean they 
would struggle to turn a profit. There also been no requirement by aviation authorities to make social distancing 
mandatory on board.
Airlines have introduced other safety measures, such as mandatory face masks for passengers and crew, 
enhanced cabin cleaning and changing boarding and in-flight processes to reduce interpersonal contact.
Aircraft manufacturers are also investigating other ways to improve safety. Boeing is looking at new materials such 
as antimicrobial coatings or surfaces that would kill any virus that lands on them.

It is also developing a portable ultraviolet disinfector that Mr Haas said could be available "in a year or so". 
Designed as a backpack with a handheld UV wand, airline staff could wave the light over the area to be disinfected 
and any virus would be killed "in seconds".
Julian Tang, a consultant virologist at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said that because of the effectiveness of the 
aircraft's ventilation system, the risk really came from how close people are when they are talking to cabin crew or 
to each other. He said there were small things passengers could do to limit their exposure.
"If I had to fly, I'd go on with a mask and I'd try and eat when no one else is eating. Things like that can help stagger 
the risk a bit," added Mr Tang.

Ryanair Group is giving up its Austrian AOC.
Ryanair Group's Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion will be closed and its assets transferred to a new Maltese AOC 
called Lauda Europe.
The headquarters will move from Vienna to Malta, Laudamotion CEO Andreas Gruber told Aviation Week Network 
in an exclusive interview.
Following other Ryanair Group fleets, Laudamotion's Airbus A320s will be registered in Malta to reduce taxes. All 
30 Airbus A320s will be re-registered from OE- to the 9H- country registration.
"We will subsequently reduce our Austrian AOC operation, close it and return [the AOC to the Austrian authorities]. 
We already applied for a Maltese AOC and plan to start operations from November," Gruber told Aviation Week.
All employees will be offered positions at Lauda Europe. An office will remain in Vienna, but the head office will be 
transferred to Malta.
Lauda Europe Ltd. will remain as a wet-lease operator for Ryanair Group airlines. "But we would be also available 
for other airlines in the ACMI (aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance) business if one day traffic recovers to 
better levels," Gruber said.
Gruber described current load-factors and overall travel demand as "challenging." Following the reopening of 
Lauda's Vienna (VIE) A320 base on July 1, Ryanair-which has taken over Laudamotion's slots at the airport-has 
operated a mixture of Boeing and Airbus aircraft to VIE.
"Our move to Malta will deliver enormous positive effects, not only in reducing costs and taxes. Because we also 
plan to start new bases again in the future wherever our clients want to have our aircraft," Gruber said.
Lauda Europe should also bring financial benefits for many employees and minimize the impact caused by so-
called double taxation agreements. All crews currently fall under Austria's tax law, no matter where they are based. 
"Lauda Europe will be more flexible," Gruber said.
Laudamotion to evolve into Malta -Based Lauda Europe
Lauda will continue to operate bases in Dusseldorf, Germany (DUS); Palma de Mallorca, Spain (PMI); and Vienna 
(VIE). The carrier will close its German base at Stuttgart Airport (STR) by Oct. 30 after failing to agree to a new 
collective labor agreement (CLA) with staff there.
Laudamotion has lost (EURO)300 million ($339 million) in the two years since its March 2018 launch.
In June 2019, Ryanair announced plans to establish Malta Air in a joint venture with the Government of Malta. "I 
guess the Ryanair Group has already up to 150 aircrafts registered in Malta," Gruber said.
Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings is the parent company of Buzz, Lauda, Malta Air and Ryanair DAC.

Low-cost carrier Wizz Air is shrugging off early signs of a new clampdown on international air travel, promising to 
expand its fleet by 50 per cent over the next three years as rivals retrench.
Announcing a pre-tax loss of (EURO)107.4m in the first three months during the aviation industry's worst-ever 
downturn, Jozsef Varadi, chief executive of the Hungarian carrier, said he expected a "rollercoaster" of measures 
across Europe as governments struggled to contain new coronavirus outbreaks after lockdowns were eased.
Mr Varadi, who in June sharply criticised the UK's initial quarantine on travellers from coronavirus hotspots, said the 
situation was "very fluid ... Measures are getting tightened up depending on the situation. But this is not only in one 
direction. It will be more like a rollercoaster and you will see countries and markets going up and down again."
Wizz Air's pre-tax loss compared with a profit of (EURO)75.5m last time.
Despite the volatile situation, Wizz Air expected to continue flying 65 per cent to 70 per cent of its flights over the 
rest of the year, with an average load capacity - a measure of how full the aircraft are - of roughly the same level. 
The group had flown on average 11.5 per cent of its capacity in the first quarter, but this had risen to 70 per cent by 
the end of June, well above the industry average of 40 per cent, he said.
The group also delivered a better than expected cash burn of about (EURO)80m a month in the first quarter, 
helping the London-listed group's shares rise 3.8 per cent to £35.25 yesterday.
Bullish Wizz Air plans extensive fleet expansion Airlines
Mr Varadi's comments follow the UK's decision at the weekend to reimpose a 14-day quarantine on travellers 
returning from Spain after a surge in coronavirus cases there.
Prime minister Boris Johnson has suggested restrictions could be imposed on travellers from other European 
countries while officials in France and Germany have also signalled possible new containment measures. The 
moves have prompted an outcry from the travel industry, already facing devastating losses as a result of a near 
global shutdown in April and May.
But Wizz Air remains the most bullish of the low-cost European airlines, determined to exploit the crisis to expand 
aggressively in markets abandoned by competitors looking to conserve cash until passenger traffic recovers.
While rivals are cancelling and deferring aircraft orders, Wizz Air could soon be "contemplating new aircraft orders", 
Mr Varadi said. There were no current discussions, he added, but Wizz Air could already envisage adding to the 
aircraft already on order.
Even with its growth ambitions, Wizz Air will remain substantially smaller than Europe's biggest low-cost carrier 
Ryanair.

Jul 29, 2020( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)  Spain's 
tourism sector faces ruin following new advisories from Germany and Britain due to a surge in coronavirus cases. 
Spanish resorts are highly dependent on holidaymakers from northern Europe, especially this year.The UK's 
sudden decision on Saturday to enforce a 14-day quarantine on travelers from Spain sent shockwaves through an 
already troubled Spanish tourism sector. Within hours, TUI, Europe's largest travel firm, and budget airline Jet2 
cancelled flights from Britain to mainland Spain for at least two weeks, leaving holidaymakers with little time to 
make alternative arrangements.While TUI's competitors, including Ryanair and EasyJet, say they will maintain their 
flights, the airlines are also believed to have seen widespread cancellations as British travelers say they can't afford 
to miss work and self-isolate for 14 days upon return from their summer vacation. 
Both airlines' share price plummeted close to 10% on Monday following the quarantine announcement. The UK's 
latest travel update went even further, advising against all but essential travel to Spain for the time being.Two days 
later, Germany advised its nationals against non-essential travel to three regions of Spain worst affected by a surge 
in coronavirus cases. The decision applies to Aragon, Navarra and Catalonia — including the popular coastal city of 
Barcelona and the Costa Brava.Read more: Coronavirus latest: 'We have become negligent,' says disease agency 
chiefWhat it means for Spain's tourism sectorSpain's economy is heavily reliant on tourism, which makes up 12% of 
its gross domestic product (GDP). The huge influx of tens of millions of holidaymakers from northern Europe is a 
major economic boost for poorer coastal regions like Andalusia, for which agriculture is the other main earner, and 
where the unemployment rate is the highest in the European Union.Britons make up the largest group of foreign 
tourists to Spain — some 18 million travelled there last year. This week alone, some 600,000 Brits were due to fly to 
Spain, according to estimates from public relations group PC Agency, cited by the Financial Times. Germans, 
meanwhile, are the second largest group — some 11.2 million traveled to the Iberian country in 2019.Tourism is 
also responsible for 11% of jobs in a country with a stubbornly high jobless rate, at more than 15%. Tens of 
thousands of seasonal workers move from northern and rural parts of the country to the eastern and southern 
holiday resorts — as well as the Balearic and Canary islands — during the summer months to pick up work in 
hotels, bars and restaurants.Hundreds of thousands of older Britons and Germans have holiday homes or retire 
along Spain's Mediterranean coast. Their bumper pensions are another huge source of income for regional 
economies. Foreigners have helped Spain's beleaguered property sector to recover in the wake of the crash during 
the 2008/09 financial crisis. Home prices on the coast and the Spanish islands have been increasing faster than the 
rest of the country, according to recent study by property appraisers Tinsa.Read more: Coronavirus in Mallorca:

countries from the coronavirus pandemic, the national and regional governments faced a dilemma over how quickly 
to reopen to international tourists. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez vowed that the country would be ready to 
welcome holidaymakers — at least from Europe — by July 1, but the extent of social distancing rules, which has 
limited the number of customers a restaurant or bar can host, has led many owners of hospitality outlets to question 
whether they should reopen at all.Many of those who have bitten the bullet are barely making ends meet. According 
to research firm Dingus, Spanish hotels had reported that cancellations since the start of the year for July bookings 
had reached 64%. The figures were released even before the new German and British travel warning. Other data 
hints at the trouble facing holidays this summer, showing that occupancy from January to June was just 33% 
compared to 73% last year.Although reports of crowds of Germans and Britons partying on the island of Mallorca 
have hit the headlines due to the lack of social distancing, reports suggest that many usually crowded beach towns 
are eerily quiet.UK travel agencies, meanwhile, have had to heavily discount holidays to Spain to make it 
worthwhile for tourists to self-isolate upon their return. They were already offering 99 (€109, $128) bargains to 
entice people to travel abroad. Those deals will have knock-on effects on the profitability of airlines, hotels and 
transport firms this summer, who have already danced with insolvency during lockdown.Read more: Budapest

prompted by the UK's decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on travellers returning from Spain could alone cost 
the Spanish tourism sector €10 billion ($11.73 billion) in lost revenue, Jorge Marichal, the head of the tourism 
association CEHAT, told La Sexta television. The missing revenue from German tourists will similarly reach the 
billions.It is too early to know how many hospitality sector workers are missing from Spain's tourism resorts this 
summer due to bars, restaurants and hotels making do with fewer staff. Anecdotal reports suggest many workers 
had just not been needed this season. A further hit to arrivals in August due to the new German-UK travel 
advisories could see thousands more tourism sector workers laid off. The loss of income has a knock-on effect on 
those already poor regions where many workers originate.More than a million Spaniards lost their jobs during the 
coronavirus lockdown — a figure that doesn't include those workers who have been furloughed, which is believed to 
have affected another million people.

Austria 's Lauda to close, be replaced with new Maltese unit
Austria's Lauda to close, be replaced with new Maltese unit

Lauda (OE, Vienna) has announced that it will cease operations by the end of 2020 and will be replaced by a new 
unit, Lauda Europe, which has already commenced its certification in Malta. The Austrian subsidiary of Ryanair 
Holdings said that the new unit would continue to operate A320-200s as a capacity provider under wet-lease terms 
for the needs of the entire group from its existing bases in Austria, Germany, and Spain, as well as new bases 
around Europe. Lauda Europe plans to commence operations in November 2020, subject to its AOC being secured 
by then. 
The low-cost carrier holding blamed Austrian tax regulations for the decision, saying that they prevented 
Laudamotion GmbH (Lauda's legal name) from fulfilling the true potential of the Lauda brand. In particular, it 
pointed out that by demanding that all employees be taxed under Austrian law, regardless of the location of their 
bases, the regulations hindered the expansion of Lauda as a wet-lease provider in other countries. "Lauda Europe 
will allow German and Spanish based cabin crews to pay their income taxes in Germany and in Spain. Lauda 
Europe will also facilitate new bases being opened across Europe, with pilots and cabin crew employed on local 
contracts... Lauda Europe, with an Airbus AOC, will offer greater flexibility to the Ryanair Group, as it will open up 
bases across Europe without the penal restrictions imposed by Austria's income tax system," the group said. 
Ryanair Holdings criticised Austria for first demanding Austrian income taxation of crews based abroad but then 
refusing to provide COVID-related job protection assistance covering these workers. Staff who recently accepted 
new collective labour agreement at Lauda will be allowed to transfer to Lauda Europe.

Lauda (OE, Vienna) has announced that it will cease operations by the end of 2020 and will be replaced by a new 
unit, Lauda Europe, which has already commenced its certification in Malta. The Austrian subsidiary of Ryanair 
Holdings said that the new unit would continue to operate A320-200s as a capacity provider under wet-lease terms 
for the needs of the entire group from its existing bases in Austria, Germany, and Spain, as well as new bases 
around Europe. Lauda Europe plans to commence operations in November 2020, subject to its AOC being secured 
by then. 
The low-cost carrier holding blamed Austrian tax regulations for the decision, saying that they prevented 
Laudamotion GmbH (Lauda's legal name) from fulfilling the true potential of the Lauda brand. In particular, it 
pointed out that by demanding that all employees be taxed under Austrian law, regardless of the location of their 
bases, the regulations hindered the expansion of Lauda as a wet-lease provider in other countries. "Lauda Europe 
will allow German and Spanish based cabin crews to pay their income taxes in Germany and in Spain. Lauda 
Europe will also facilitate new bases being opened across Europe, with pilots and cabin crew employed on local 
contracts... Lauda Europe, with an Airbus AOC, will offer greater flexibility to the Ryanair Group, as it will open up 
bases across Europe without the penal restrictions imposed by Austria's income tax system," the group said. 
Ryanair Holdings criticised Austria for first demanding Austrian income taxation of crews based abroad but then 
refusing to provide COVID-related job protection assistance covering these workers. Staff who recently accepted 
new collective labour agreement at Lauda will be allowed to transfer to Lauda Europe.

earnings beat for the eighth straight quarter in the second quarter. Further, it witnessed solid recovery in demand 
across all regions in June. It is also poised to gain from rising demand for home and kitchen products. Notably, 
management issued positive sales view for 2020. The company has chalked out plans to protect margins and 
enhance liquidity position to navigate through this recent scenario. These endeavors are likely to generate more 
than $500 million of net cost takeout. However, COVID-19 disruptions along with higher prices impacted margins in 
the second quarter. Also, both the top and bottom lines fell year over year with sales decline across all regions due 
to muted demand due to the COVID-19 crisis."

Ryanair has a few tricks left to see it through quarantine

agic Mike's touch can only take Ryanair so far.
Michael O'Leary's airline posted decent results for a disastrous quarter yesterday. Shares fell anyway. The UK 
government's Saturday night surprise of a Spanish quarantine sent investors scrambling. Ryanair was one of the 
lucky ones: its shares dropped only about 4 per cent to IAG's 6 per cent and easyJet's 8 per cent.
Spain is a setback for the industry, which was just getting back to business. Ryanair grounded 99 per cent of its 
flights for the three-and-a-half months to the end of June; in July it was back to running 40 per cent of its schedule. 
Flights between the UK and Spain made up around 8.5 per cent of Ryanair's network last year, calculates analyst 
Stephen Furlong of Davy. At easyJet, Mr Furlong puts the figure closer to 11 per cent.
Still, it is not the Spanish summer but an autumnal second wave that frightens Mike's men most. Ryanair reckons it 
will run as many as 70 per cent of flights in September. Disruption after that may be more damaging. A spike in 
European virus cases to coincide with flu season could mean more job cuts, Mr O'Leary warned. Passenger 
numbers might fall even further than the 60 per cent Ryanair is projecting for the year to March 2021.
Ryanair's worst fear could well be realised. Even so, the airline looks among the least exposed in the industry. 
Yesterday's quarterly earnings showed why.
At a time when cash is king, Ryanair has oodles of the stuff. It had almost (EURO)4bn at the end of June, after 
borrowing (EURO)600m through the Bank of England's bond buying scheme. Sectorleading cost control has also 
Ryanair has a few tricks left to see it through quarantine
helped. Ryanair trimmed costs 85 per cent in the three months to June. Not bad, even if revenues did fall further. 
Since its July restart, Ryanair is now cash break-even or better.
The carrier still has plenty of tricks to pull out of the bag. It has roughly (EURO)7bn worth of 737s it could borrow 
against. It can squeeze revenue-starved airports on fees, by promising growth in passenger numbers during a 
forthcoming period of industrywide retrenchment. It can beat up Boeing over the manufacturer's much-delayed Max 
planes. Negotiations on both price and compensation are ongoing.
This will undoubtedly be a damp squib of a year for airlines. Count on Mr O'Leary to put on a better show than 
most.

Shares in rapid descent Curbs take toll on Tui , easyJet and IAG
Shares in rapid descent Curbs take toll on Tui, easyJet and IAG

Europe's travel industry was left reeling yesterday after new restrictions threatened to destroy what was left of the 
summer season, sending shares in airlines and tour operators tumbling.
Investors reacted with alarm to the decision over the weekend by the UK to impose a two-week quarantine on 
travellers returning from Spain, a popular destination for holidaymakers but one where infections in certain regions 
have been rising.
France also warned against travel to parts of Spain, deepening the blow to hopes of a late-summer revival in a 
tourism sector hit hard by the virus.
Having welcomed "transport corridors" with low-risk countries as a chance to kickstart the season, the sector was 
dismayed at the curbs.
Shares in Tui, Europe's largest tour operator, led the way lower with a 12 per cent decline, leaving the company the 
worst performer in Europe's benchmark Stoxx 600 index.
Low-cost airline easyJet was the hardest hit among big carriers with its shares falling 7 per cent. British Airways 
owner IAG lost 6 per cent and Germany's Lufthansa shed 5 per cent.
The Spanish tourism industry is heavily reliant on UK holidaymakers. About 18m Britons visited last year, more than 
any other nationality, according to research company Statista.

The UK quarantine decision provoked an angry response from Madrid, which insists the pandemic is under control. 
Arancha González Laya, foreign minister, said the government was focused on securing exemptions for the Canary 
and Balearic Islands, two popular tourist regions with lower case numbers, adding that the epidemiological data on 
infections from the islands was "well below" the levels in the UK.
There was fury, too, from the airline industry, which has slashed tens of thousands of jobs and tapped investors for 
cash in a bid to survive the pandemic.
The International Air Transport Association said the UK decision "falls short of the mark".
"A unilaterally decided blanket quarantine order for everybody returning from Spain does not accurately reflect the 
risk of a regional spike in one corner of the country," the industry body said.
The British Chambers of Commerce said the "abrupt" UK decision "will be yet another hammer blow for the fragile 
travel and tourism industries".
Tui called for a more "nuanced" policy allowing quarantine-free travel to some parts of Spain.
The UK defended its decision, saying it would change advice "rapidly if necessary" to stop the spread of 
coronavirus.
Shares in Ryanair dropped 4 per cent, having reported a loss earlier yesterday, and warned that a new wave of 
infections in the autumn was "our biggest fear right now".
The airline said it hoped European governments would not implement further travel restrictions, but said it expected 
a "very challenging year" and was unable to offer financial guidance.

Quarantine measures for British holidaymakers returning from Spain are

Until this weekend, the European tourism industry had high hopes of reclaiming at least a small portion of the 
crucial summer holiday season after months of lockdown.
Customer bookings had increased week-on-week as national borders began to open but yesterday hotel and travel 
groups faced an unexpected reality check.
Localised upticks of coronavirus cases in Spain pushed the UK government to advise against travel to the country 
and enforce a 14-day quarantine for any returning travellers.
Instead of boarding customers on to planes, companies found themselves in emergency talks with the UK and 
Spanish governments to try to agree local air corridors that would allow travel between less affected regions.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of the low-cost carrier Ryanair, called the quarantine measures a "badly managed 
overreaction", while Andrew Flint, managing director of Tui UK & Ireland, said that Tui was "strongly advising [the 
government] against the 'one size fits all' approach".
Tourism sector reeling after hopes of saving summer season are dashed Quarantine measures for British

José María Mañaricua, who owns the four-hotel Gloria Thalasso & Hotels chain in the Canary Islands, said he 
expected "lots of cancellations by all those people who can't permit themselves the luxury of 14 days without 
working when they return".
The travel and tourism industry has suffered heavy losses from the near total shutdown in travel with fleets 
grounded and hotels forced to close.
"Salvaging the summer season was probably the sector's big hope for recovery," said Rob Griggs, policy director of 
the trade body Airlines UK, while the renewed uncertainty around the peak period threatened to make a "difficult 
winter" even more challenging.
Ryanair, which has previously said it will make up to 3,000 staff redundant, said yesterday that traffic had fallen 
from 42m passengers to 500,000 from April to June. British Airways has said it will cut up to 30 per cent of staff.
Tui, where 8,000 jobs will be cut, said over the weekend it would cancel trips to mainland Spain until August 9 and 
offer refunds or incentives to rebook.
"Many of our customers are still looking to get away this summer and our data show that they are booking within a 
week of departure," Mr Flint said, adding that bookings for Greece and Turkey increased over the weekend, as 
customers looked for alternative destinations to Spain.
Tui's rival Jet2 is still operating flights and holidays to four mainland Spain locations, away from areas affected by 
increases in Covid cases.
Around 18m UK holidaymakers travel to Spain each year, the country's largest source of tourists, making the 
problem of travel restrictions particularly acute.
Hotel occupancy levels on the popular Balearic Islands, which include Majorca and Ibiza, had crept up from around 
25 per cent in July to 34 per cent in August - a trend seen in resorts around the Mediterranean coast.
For travel companies hoping that some 2020 revenues could be salvaged, the short notice and sweeping approach 
of the UK government's travel advice accompanied by warnings from the French government not to travel to parts 
of Spain came as a shock.
It was just six hours between the UK government announcing its advice against travel to Spain on Saturday and 
quarantine restrictions being imposed.
"Tour operators and airlines are not set up to cope with the pace at which the travel advice is evolving. It was only 
three weeks ago that these destinations reopened and now advice has changed and quarantine has been re-
implemented. For operators this simply adds to the scale of the challenge," said Simon Cooper, chief executive of 
the online travel company On The Beach.
Javier Arus, partner at the real estate fund Azora, which announced yesterday a new (EURO)1.5bn investment fund 
targeting the European "sun and beach" hotel segment, said that some Spanish hotels had just reopened "based 
on the expected UK business".
Faced with local flare-ups for the foreseeable future, Gloria Guevara, president of the World Travel and Tourism 
Council, said that countries needed to come up with a more nuanced approach. "Painting an entire country with the 
same brush does not benefit anyone. While we understand the concern about destinations like Spain with new 
Covid-19 cases, the majority of the country and its islands, which are incredibly popular holiday destinations, have 
less cases than the UK."
The WTTC has called for quarantines to be replaced with better test and trace systems and international travel 
protocols. If not, it has warned that the $2tn European tourism industry could lose 80 per cent of its annual 
contribution to the economy with around four-fifths of jobs lost.

Operators catering to inbound travellers in the UK are also under pressure. Visitors from Spain accounted for nearly 
£1bn worth of spending in the UK last year with Spain the fifth highest country in terms of visitor numbers.
Joss Croft, chief executive of the trade body UKInbound, said the sector was "on its knees" and that he feared the 
impact on other countries. "When people around the world see [the restrictions], it will put off travellers from other 
key European markets who will worry that they will have to have quarantines if they come."
UKInbound said it expects more than half of inbound tourism businesses to fail within the next six months without 
extra financial support.
Analysts at Jefferies warned in a note that across the travel sector, the hit to customer confidence "could lead to a 
weaker lates market [of last-minute summer bookings] and a delayed booking cycle for next year".
Carrie Smith, who lives near Cardiff and works in TV production, had planned a holiday to Majorca with her 
husband and two children, said she stood to lose around £3,000 on unused bookings as a result of the quarantine 
measures, adding that a fear of future lockdowns meant she was reluctant to travel at all this year.
The measures "made no sense", she said. "We've no confidence now that [politicians are] not going to change their 
mind."

José María Mañaricua, who owns the four-hotel Gloria Thalasso & Hotels chain in the Canary Islands, said he 
expected "lots of cancellations by all those people who can't permit themselves the luxury of 14 days without 
working when they return".
The travel and tourism industry has suffered heavy losses from the near total shutdown in travel with fleets 
grounded and hotels forced to close.
"Salvaging the summer season was probably the sector's big hope for recovery," said Rob Griggs, policy director of 
the trade body Airlines UK, while the renewed uncertainty around the peak period threatened to make a "difficult 
winter" even more challenging.
Ryanair, which has previously said it will make up to 3,000 staff redundant, said yesterday that traffic had fallen 
from 42m passengers to 500,000 from April to June. British Airways has said it will cut up to 30 per cent of staff.
Tui, where 8,000 jobs will be cut, said over the weekend it would cancel trips to mainland Spain until August 9 and 
offer refunds or incentives to rebook.
"Many of our customers are still looking to get away this summer and our data show that they are booking within a 
week of departure," Mr Flint said, adding that bookings for Greece and Turkey increased over the weekend, as 
customers looked for alternative destinations to Spain.
Tui's rival Jet2 is still operating flights and holidays to four mainland Spain locations, away from areas affected by 
increases in Covid cases.
Around 18m UK holidaymakers travel to Spain each year, the country's largest source of tourists, making the 
problem of travel restrictions particularly acute.
Hotel occupancy levels on the popular Balearic Islands, which include Majorca and Ibiza, had crept up from around 
25 per cent in July to 34 per cent in August - a trend seen in resorts around the Mediterranean coast.
For travel companies hoping that some 2020 revenues could be salvaged, the short notice and sweeping approach 
of the UK government's travel advice accompanied by warnings from the French government not to travel to parts 
of Spain came as a shock.
It was just six hours between the UK government announcing its advice against travel to Spain on Saturday and 
quarantine restrictions being imposed.
"Tour operators and airlines are not set up to cope with the pace at which the travel advice is evolving. It was only 
three weeks ago that these destinations reopened and now advice has changed and quarantine has been re-
implemented. For operators this simply adds to the scale of the challenge," said Simon Cooper, chief executive of 
the online travel company On The Beach.
Javier Arus, partner at the real estate fund Azora, which announced yesterday a new (EURO)1.5bn investment fund 
targeting the European "sun and beach" hotel segment, said that some Spanish hotels had just reopened "based 
on the expected UK business".
Faced with local flare-ups for the foreseeable future, Gloria Guevara, president of the World Travel and Tourism 
Council, said that countries needed to come up with a more nuanced approach. "Painting an entire country with the 
same brush does not benefit anyone. While we understand the concern about destinations like Spain with new 
Covid-19 cases, the majority of the country and its islands, which are incredibly popular holiday destinations, have 
less cases than the UK."
The WTTC has called for quarantines to be replaced with better test and trace systems and international travel 
protocols.

holidaymakers returning from Spain are hitting operators h....
If not, it has warned that the $2tn European tourism industry could lose 80 per cent of its annual contribution to the 
economy with around four-fifths of jobs lost.
Operators catering to inbound travellers in the UK are also under pressure. Visitors from Spain accounted for nearly 
£1bn worth of spending in the UK last year with Spain the fifth highest country in terms of visitor numbers.
Joss Croft, chief executive of the trade body UKInbound, said the sector was "on its knees" and that he feared the 
impact on other countries. "When people around the world see [the restrictions], it will put off travellers from other 
key European markets who will worry that they will have to have quarantines if they come."
UKInbound said it expects more than half of inbound tourism businesses to fail within the next six months without 
extra financial support.
Analysts at Jefferies warned in a note that across the travel sector, the hit to customer confidence "could lead to a 
weaker lates market [of last-minute summer bookings] and a delayed booking cycle for next year".
Carrie Smith, who lives near Cardiff and works in TV production, had planned a holiday to Majorca with her 
husband and two children, said she stood to lose around £3,000 on unused bookings as a result of the quarantine 
measures, adding that a fear of future lockdowns meant she was reluctant to travel at all this year.
The measures "made no sense", she said. "We've no confidence now that [politicians are] not going to change their 
mind."

Jul 28, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Irish budget airline Ryanair has 
announced a loss of €185 million for the first quarter of 2020, which included an almost total grounding of air traffic 
due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airline said that traffic fell 99%[1] during Q1, and that it expects a smaller loss 
in Q2 as it continues to increase its flying schedule. 
Travel restrictions led to a collapse in the number of travellers, with 500,000 passengers in Q1 compared with 41.9 
million in Q1 of last year. 'It is impossible to predict how long the Covid-19 pandemic will persist', the company said, 
adding that 'a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late autumn is our biggest fear right now'. The 
carrier also said it expects air travel to be depressed in Europe for the next 2 to 3 years. The United Kingdom 
imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day quarantine for people 
returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France[2] urged its citizens not to visit Spain's Catalonia region. 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the British quarantine was 'a badly managed overreaction' and that the airline is 
not planning[3] to reduce flying capacity to Spain. [ 1]: https://www.neweurope.eu/article/ryanair-expected-to-halt-

$1.2 per share. The carrier regarded first-quarter fiscal 2021 as the most challenging in its 35 years of history with 
EU governments' travel restrictions and lockdowns across several nations. More than 99% of the airline's fleet was 
grounded from mid-March to June-end.Quarterly revenues of $137.8 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
of $138.6 million. Moreover, the top line plunged 94.7% year over year due to massive decline in traffic.Ryanair's 
loss after tax came in at €185.1 million in first-quarter fiscal 2021, against profit after tax of €242.9 million in the 
year-ago period. 
Traffic dropped 99% year over year to 0.5 million due to weak travel demand and flight restrictions amid coronavirus 
concerns. Load factor deteriorated to 61% from 96% in first-quarter fiscal 2020.Ancillary revenues fell 97% year 
over year in the reported quarter. The airline's fuel costs declined 99% year over year due to reduced flying amid 
coronavirus-related fleet groundings. Total operating expenses fell 85% year over year. Ryanair, carrying a Zacks 
Rank #3 (Hold), had cash of more than €3.9 billion as of Jun 30, 2020. You can see the complete list of today's

View original post here[2].Looking to the week ahead, and just after the biggest two week fall in the Nasdaq (-
2.39%) since the turmoil in mid March, DB's Jim Reid writes that one of the most interesting things this week will be 
earnings releases from Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook (all on Thursday) together with roughly a third of 
the S&#38;P reporting Q2 results. This could have a big impact on sentiment, especially if the tech giant follow Intel 
and disappoint. Intel falling -16.24% on Friday after results the previous night helped tech sentiment dip a little on 
Friday. Digging more into earnings, we have many of the world's biggest companies reporting this week. 
In total, releases include 190 from the S&#38;P 500 and a further 169 from the STOXX 600. Among the releases 
include SAP, Ryanair and LVMH today. Then tomorrow we'll hear from Starbucks, Visa, McDonald's, Pfizer, 
Peugeot and Nissan. Wednesday will see Sanofi, Rio Tinto, GlaxoSmithKline, Qualcomm, PayPal, Boeing, 
Santander, General Electric, General Motors, Barclays and Nomura release earnings. After that, Thursday's 
releases include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Samsung, Nestle, Procter &#38; Gamble, Comcast, L'Oreal, 
Stanley Black &#38; Decker, AstraZeneca, Linde, Mastercard, American Tower, AB InBev, Total, Volkswagen, 
Ford, Royal Dutch Shell, Lloyds Banking Group and Credit Suisse. Finally on Friday, there's Chevron, Charter 
Communications, Merck, AbbVie, Phillips 66, ExxonMobil, BNP Paribas, Caterpillar, Nokia, NatWest Group and Fiat 
Chrysler 
Automobiles.https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-
images/weekly%20earnings%20july%2027.png?itok=ed9mwhKm Elsewhere one of the key macro highlights this 
week will be the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy decision, along with Chair Powell's subsequent press 
conference. Recent communications from the Fed have made it clear that the FOMC will soon pivot away from 
stabilization towards accommodation, and in a piece earlier this week, DB's economists released the first of a two 
part series looking at how much accommodation will be needed and how it will be provided. On Friday, Reid 
published a CoTD to suggest that if balance sheet was the only tool used, to keep policy neutral an extra 12 trillion 
of QE could be required. We are currently at $7tn. Data releases will also get a decent amount of attention, 
particularly given the Q2 GDP releases out in the US (Thursday) and the Euro Area (Thursday/Friday) that are likely 
to show some of the largest quarterly contractions in history. They will also help calibrate forecasts for economists 
going forward. The other main data release will be the release of PMIs from China on Friday. All the other data 
releases will be in the day by day calendar at the end. A day-by-day calendar of key global events is below courtesy

looking at just the US, the key event this week is the July FOMC meeting, with the release of the statement at 2:00 
PM ET on Wednesday followed by Chair Powell's press conference at 2:30 PM. The key economic data releases 
this week are the durable goods report on Monday, the initial Q2 GDP estimate on Thursday, and the personal 
income and spending and UMich consumer sentiment reports on Friday.https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-

preliminary (GS +2.0%, consensus +7.0%, last +15.7%); Durable goods orders ex-transportation, June preliminary 
(GS +2.0%, consensus +3.5%, last +3.7%); Core capital goods orders, June preliminary (GS +1.0%, consensus 
+2.4%, last +1.6%); Core capital goods shipments, June preliminary (GS +1.0%, consensus +2.8%, last +1.5%): 
We expect durable goods orders to increase 2.0% in the preliminary June report, reflecting cancellations in aircraft 
orders. We expect a 1.0% increase in core capital goods orders, given the elevated level in May relative to other 
industrial data series. 10:30 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Activity, July (consensus -4.9%, last -6.1%) Tuesday, 
July 28 09:00 AM S&#38;P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index, May (GS +0.4%, consensus +0.30%, last 
+0.33%); We estimate the S&#38;P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index increased by 0.4% in May, following a 
0.33% increase in April. 10:00 AM Conference Board consumer confidence, July (GS 94.0, consensus 94.4, last 
98.1); We estimate that the Conference Board consumer confidence index declined by 4.1pt to 94.0 in July, as the 
deteriorating virus situation could weigh on confidence. 10:00 AM Richmond Fed Manufacturing, July (consensus 5, 
last 0) Wednesday, July 29 08:30 AM Advance goods trade balance, June (GS -$76.0bn, consensus -$75.1bn, last 
-$74.3bn); We estimate that the goods trade deficit increased to $76.0bn in June due to a larger rebound in goods 
imports than in goods exports. 08:30 AM Wholesale Inventories, June preliminary (consensus -0.3%, last -1.2%) 
10:00 AM Pending home sales, June (GS +22.0%, consensus +14.5%, last +44.3%); We estimate that pending 
home sales increased by 22.0% in June based on regional home sales data, following a 44.3% surge in May. We 
have found pending home sales to be a useful leading indicator of existing home sales with a one-to-two-month lag. 
02:00 PM FOMC statement, July 28-29 meeting; As discussed in our FOMC preview, major policy changes are 
unlikely at the July meeting. We now expect the FOMC to complete its framework review in September and to then 
change its forward guidance and asset purchase policies in November, a one meeting delay compared to our 
previous expectations. Thursday, July 30 08:30 AM GDP, Q2 advance (GS -29.0%, consensus -35.0%, last -5.0%); 
Personal consumption, Q2 advance (GS -34.5%, consensus -34.5%, last -6.8%): We estimate a 29% drop in the 
initial release of Q2 GDP (qoq ar). Our forecast reflects a 34.5% annualized drop in personal consumption related 
to the coronavirus lockdowns. We also expect very large declines in structures investment (-25%) and equipment 
investment (-44%). Despite the large expected GDP decline, we believe economic reality during the quarter was 
even worse, with a first-print bias from incomplete source data and survey non-response worth roughly +4pp 
(implying a true GDP growth rate of around -33%). We will finalize our GDP forecast after Wednesday morning's 
trade balance and inventory data. 08:30 AM Initial jobless claims, week ended July 25 (GS 1,400k, consensus 
Key Events In The Coming Week: Peak Earnings, Fed And GDP

LONDON (AP) — European budget airline Ryanair said Monday that the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc 
on its earnings, with lockdown restrictions leading to a 99% drop in passengers in the first quarter, and warned 
travel is likely to remain subdued for years.
The airline, which grew in recent years to become the region's busiest carrier, says the quarter was the “most 
challenging’’ in its history, with a loss of 185 million euros ($216 million). It described a second wave of COVID-19 
as its “biggest fear.”
Travel restrictions led to a collapse in the number of travellers, with 500,000 passengers in the first quarter 
compared with 41.9 million in the same period last year.
The low-cost carrier expects air travel to be depressed in Europe for the next two to three years.
Ryanair shares fell 4% on Monday. The stock price of other European travel and tourism companies also got 
slammed on concerns about new travel restrictions in Europe to deal with a flare-up in contagions in some parts of 
the region, particularly Spain. Shares were down some 13% in tour operator TUI, by over 8% in British Airways 
parent company IAG and 10% in budget airline easyJet.
The British government this weekend imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway 
ordered a 10-day quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not 
to visit Spain’s Catalonia region.

 US stocks rose while oil slipped and gold touched a new record high after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin 
reportedly called for bipartisan support for an economic relief program of about $1 trillion and amid concern of 
COVID-19 resurgence in Europe.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 96.48 points intraday, or 0.4%, to 26,567.30. S&P 500 climbed by 0.5% 
to 3,230.96 points and Nasdaq traded 1% higher at 10,465.59. Technology and materials were among the biggest 
gainers, while financials and energy among the steepest decliners after midday on Monday.
West Texas Intermediate futures, which dropped by as low as 1.4% intraday, traded 0.1% lower at $41.28. Gold 
rallied $35 per ounce to $1,932.50.
Goldman Sachs (GS) on Monday said the recovery in demand for oil following pandemic lockdowns is slowing as 
coronavirus infections continue to surge in the US and elsewhere. In the US, the number of cases hit almost 16.3 
million, with fatalities close to 147,000. In Spain, the case count jumped to more than 272,000 and the death toll 
was above 28,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Referring to an abrupt two-week quarantine announced on travelers coming into the UK from Spain, Dominic Raab, 
the British foreign secretary, said it was "absolutely necessary" to reimpose the rules with such short notice given a 
surge in coronavirus cases in parts of the country. The UK leads Europe in terms of the number of death counts.
Ryanair (RYAAY), Europe's biggest budget airline, said Monday that fiscal 2021 was expected to be a "very 
challenging" while cutting annual passenger traffic projections by 20 million. It said: "A second wave of COVID-19 
cases across Europe in late autumn (when the annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now."
Midday Report: US Stocks Rise, Gold Surges as Countdown Begins for Fifth Economic Relief Package; 
COVID-19 Hits Europe Sentiment
In the US, the dollar depreciated by 0.9% against the euro to 1.1755, the lowest level since late 2018, as media 
reports said Senate Republicans Monday were set to introduce a $1 trillion coronavirus relief program agreed with 
the White House, and the package will now be negotiated with Democrats. More stimulus is needed to help people, 
companies, and schools to tackle the impact of the pandemic.
Meanwhile, new orders for manufactured durable goods jumped by 7.3% in June to $206.9 billion, according to the 
US Census Bureau. That was ahead of 6.5% Econoday consensus. May's advance was, however, revised down to 
an increase of 15.1% climb versus a gain of 15.8% reported previously.
In US corporate news, Hasbro (HAS) saw a sharp drop in second-quarter revenue as demand for its products was 
stymied by shortages and store closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the firm said it's expecting an 
improvement in the current period. Shares slumped by 7.7% intraday, the steepest decliner on the S&P 500 and 
Nasdaq indexes.
Under Armour (UAA) on Monday said it has received a notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it 
may face enforcement action over how the athletic-apparel company accounted for sales in 2015 and 2016.
In the precious metals markets, gold was 1.8% higher at $1,932.50 an ounce, silver was up 1.6% to $24.44 an 
ounce, and copper was up by 0.3% to $2.90 per pound.
Among energy ETFs, the United States Oil Fund rose 0.2% to $29.50 while the United States Natural Gas Fund fell 
3.5% to $10.24. Among precious-metal funds, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF was up 4% to $43.43 and 
SPDR Gold Shares were up 1.7% to $181.77. The iShares Silver Trust was up 6.7% to $22.62.

Ryanair Sees Coronavirus Second Wave as 'Biggest Fear' While Slashing 2021 Passenger Traffic Forecast
Ryanair Sees Coronavirus Second Wave as 'Biggest Fear' While Slashing

 Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L), Europe's biggest budget airline, said on Monday the fiscal first quarter was the most 
challenging in its 35-year history and slashed its full-year passenger traffic target amid fears of a second wave of 
COVID-19.
Revenue at the Dublin-based carrier plummeted to 125 million euros ($147 million) during the three months that 
ended June 30, from 2.31 billion euros a year ago, according to an earnings statement. The plunge in sales 
followed a 99% drop in the number of customers flown in the quarter as well as a slump in the load factor, which 
measures the percentage of available seating capacity that is filled with passengers.
The airline swung to a loss of 185 million euros versus a profit of 243 million euros a year earlier as most of 
Ryanair's fleet was grounded from mid-March due to travel restrictions and the spread of the respiratory disease. 
Still, the loss was below an internal estimate of 200 million euros.
The firm said fiscal 2021 is expected to be a "very challenging" year and it couldn't predict the duration of the 
coronavirus crisis. "A second wave of COVID-19 cases across Europe in late autumn (when the annual flu season 
commences) is our biggest fear right now."
Its annual passenger traffic forecast for the current fiscal year was cut to 60 million from a view of less than 80 
million set in May. Last year, the number of customers stood at 149 million. Ryanair said it couldn't give guidance 
for fiscal 2021 profit after tax because of the uncertainty over the pandemic and customer demand.
The carrier said its average weekly cash burn fell to more than 60 million euros in May from about 200 million euros 
in March as it cut costs, cancelled share buybacks and deferred spending. Its cash balance stood at 3.9 billion 
euros as of June 30.
Ryanair said it now sees Boeing (BA) 737 Max aircraft, whose delivery has been delayed by more than a year, 
entering its fleet before the end of 2020.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) said Monday that the first quarter of fiscal 2021 was "the most challenging" quarter in its 35-year 
history as operations came to a virtual halt amid the pandemic, crashing the company into losses in the period.
Shares tumbled 8% in the red early morning, shortly after it reported a loss attributable to equity holders for the first 
quarter ended June 30 of 185.1 million euros ($216.7 million), down from an attributable profit of 242.9 million euros 
a year ago. Revenue plummeted to 125.2 million euros from 2.31 billion euros.
During the reporting period, the company grounded 99% of its fleet and its air traffic fell by the same level due to the 
travel restrictions.
The Irish airline, however, expects to operate at about 40% capacity in July after it resumed flights July 1. 
Approximately 60% and 70% of flights are expected to be operational in August and September, respectively, as 
traveling restrictions are eased and the sector looks to recover from the outbreak.
The company also expects fiscal 2021 traffic to drop 60% from pre-COVID-19 levels to about 60 million customers 
following concerns of a series of local lockdowns due to an expected second wave of infections in autumn.
Ryanair, which has a market cap of 10.92 billion pounds sterling ($14 billion) as of Monday morning, suspended its 
guidance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, due to the uncertainty amid the outbreak but added that it 
expects a smaller quarter-over-quarter loss in the three months ending Sept. 30.

Ryanair cut its annual passenger target by a quarter on Monday and warned a second wave of COVID-19 infections 
could lower that further, sending its shares down 8% despite reporting a smaller than expected loss during its April-
June lockdown.
The Irish airline posted an after-tax loss of 185 million euros for the three months to June 30, when it cut 99% of its 
capacity as Europe locked down in the face of the COVOD-19 pandemic.
That was its first-ever loss in the quarter, but less than the 232 million euros forecast in a company poll of analysts.
It, however, cut expectations for the rest of its financial year, which ends on March 31, saying it expected to fly 60 
million passengers rather than the 80 million it forecast in May - and down from 149 million last year.
"Our full-year guidance of 60 million passengers is tentative at this point in time and it could go lower," Group Chief 
Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video presentation.
"A second wave of COVID-19 cases across Europe in late autumn ... is our biggest fear right now," O'Leary said.
Ryanair shares were down by 8% at 0723 GMT as investors digested the weaker outlook.
"The forthcoming winter season looks foreboding for even the strongest operators," Goodbody analyst Mark 
Simpson said in a note, forecasting "little upside to Ryanair until we get into the real recovery in their operations in 
the early spring".
Ryanair slashes traffic outlook and fears COVID-19 second wave
O'Leary said that in addition to the closure of airport bases already announced in Frankfurt, Berlin and Dusseldorf, 
closures were likely in Spain and in Italy unless pay cuts can be agreed with staff.
The uncertainty means Ryanair cannot give a profit guidance for its financial year, though the airline expects to lose 
less in the current quarter than the last one, he added.
O'Leary said Ryanair had seen a hit to bookings in recent days in the wake of a surge of infections in Barcelona 
and expects "more of those kind of developments".
The British government abruptly imposed on Saturday a two-week quarantine on all travellers arriving from Spain 
due to the surge, a move Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan described as "regrettable". Ryanair has no plans to 
cut capacity between the two countries, Sorahan said.
Ryanair's cash burn has effectively ended, with its cash balance up to 3.9 billion euros at end-June from 3.8 billion 
at end-March.
Revenue was down 95% in the first quarter, while costs were down by 85%.
It hopes to fly 60% of its normal schedule in August and 70% in September. Ryanair's planes should be around 
70% full in July and August, O'Leary said. (Reuters)

TUI has cancelled all of its holiday packages sold to consumers for travel to mainland Spain effective July 26, until 
at least August 9. In a press release, the United Kingdom tour operator said the move had been caused by the UK 
Foreign & Commonwealth Office's decision to again advise against all but essential travel to mainland Spain. The 
FCO said in its travel advisory for Spain that it had based its decision on its "current assessment of COVID-19 risks" 
but exempted the Balearic and Canary Islands from the recommendation. "This advice is based on evidence of 
increases in cases of COVID-19 in several regions, but particularly in Aragon, Navarra and Catalonia (which include 
the cities of Zaragoza, Pamplona and Barcelona)," it said. 
All passengers returning from mainland Spain and the two island groups will, however, have to self-isolate again on 
their return to the UK effective immediately. As a result, TUI Airways (BY, London Luton) has cancelled all of its 
scheduled services to mainland Spain with flights due to operate from Birmingham Int'l, London Gatwick, and 
Manchester Int'l to Malaga now cancelled. However, the BBC has reported that TUI said that "all customers 
currently on holiday" could "continue to enjoy their holiday and will return on their intended flight home." As of July 
26, Ryanair, easyJet, Jet2, British Airways, Vueling Airlines, Iberia, Wizz Air UK, easyJet Europe, and Air Europa 
have not followed TUI's lead and continue to operate all of their scheduled flights between the two countries.

Ryanair cut its annual passenger target by a quarter on Monday and warned the second wave of COVID-19

Ryanair expects to shut bases in Spain and Italy over the coming months, adding to closures already announced in 
Germany.
Europe's largest LCC Ryanair has warned that more bases are likely to close unless pay cuts can be agreed with 
staff.
The airline last week confirmed that Frankfurt Hahn (HHN) would shut by Nov. 1 after German pilots voted to reject 
a new pay agreement, with Berlin Tegel (TXL) and Weeze Airport (NRN) near Dusseldorf also set to close before 
the start of the winter season. Subsidiary Lauda is also axing its hub in Stuttgart (STR).
Speaking following the release of Ryanair's first quarter financial results, group CEO Michael O'Leary cautioned that 
bases in Spain and Italy are at risk if pay negotiations continue to drag. Ryanair currently has 10 bases in Spain 
and 13 in Italy.
"In Ryanair, we've been unsuccessful in persuading German pilots to agree to pay cuts, so we've announced the 
closure of Berlin Tegel, Dusseldorf Weeze and Frankfurt Hahn at the end of the summer schedule, and Lauda is 
closing its Stuttgart base," O'Leary said.
"We're also looking at some base closures in Spain, where the unions have not yet agreed to the pay cuts we need, 
and I think there's a real risk to some of the regional bases in Italy."
O'Leary said base closures in Italy were "inevitable," blaming the slow pace of negotiations with unions, as well as 
the Italian government for "trying to impose Alitalia's pay rates and abysmal productivity on other airlines and 
airports within the sector."
Ryanair resumed flying across the majority of its route network from July 1 following a hiatus of more than three 
months because of the COVID-19 crisis. It expects to operate about 40% of its normal July schedule, rising to 60% 
in August and as much as 70% in September.
The carrier also plans to maintain flights between the UK and Spain, despite the British government's sudden 
decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on visitors returning from the country after July 26.
Ryanair warns of further base closures
The UK government has advised against all non-essential travel to the Spanish mainland due to recent coronavirus 
outbreaks. TUI has opted to cancel all holidays to mainland Spain up to Aug. 9 but flights to the Balearic and 
Canary Islands will continue.
Ryanair reported a pre-tax loss tax of (EURO)210 million ($245 million) for the three months to the end of June, 
compared with a profit of (EURO)262.3 million for the same period a year ago. Revenues plunged 95% to 
(EURO)125.2 million during the "most challenging" quarter in the LCC's 35-year history.
The group has forecast that traffic for the financial year to the end of March 2021 will be in the region of 60 million 
passengers-a 60% decrease on the previous 12 months.
Despite the challenges, Ryanair expects to take delivery of its first Boeing 737 Max aircraft before the end of 2020 
and could potentially have 40 in its fleet by summer 2021.
The airline said it remains committed to the MAX, which has been grounded since March 2019 following the 
Ethiopian Airlines crash.

Ryanair sinks into the red in 'most challenging' quarter

Body
Low-cost Irish carrier Ryanair on Monday reported a first quarter net loss in a business period it said was "the most 
challenging in Ryanair's 35-year history," the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The net loss of 185 million euros (216 million dollars) in the April-to-June period, compared with a net profit of 243 
million euros in the corresponding period a year ago.
Revenue plunged 95 per cent to 125 million euros in the quarter that ended on June 30. Cost-saving measures 
could not offset the revenue loss. A year ago, the airline's revenues were 2.31 billion euros.
The company noted that more than 99 per cent of its fleet was grounded from mid-March to the end of June amid 
travel bans introduced across Europe due to the pandemic. It flew 500,000 passengers, compared to last year's 
41.5 million passengers. 
Ryanair on July 1 resumed flights across most of its route network, and expected demand to slowly rise in the 
coming months, saying it hoped to reach 70 per cent of its normal schedule in September.
The airline expected a "very challenging year," adding that "a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late 
autumn (when the annual flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now."
Ryanair also repeated recent criticism of various European government bailout schemes to flag carriers, including 
Alitalia, Air France/KLM, and Lufthansa.
The low-cast carrier, which has not received similar financial support, said the schemes "distort competition and 
allow unsustainable flag carriers to engage in below cost selling for many years to come."

If new cases hit, this could push recovery into next year, says CEO
Stormy skies... what with COVID-19 and fresh uncertainty over Brexit, things are not exactly running smooth for UK 
carriers.
Dublin: Ryanair Holdings said it will continue losing money through the summer and is concerned that a second 
wave of coronavirus infection could push back the recovery from the pandemic into next year.
Europe's biggest discount carrier posted a loss of 185 million euros ($217 million) in the three months through June, 
when its jets were idled, and expects to record a smaller shortfall the in current quarter even as flights resume, 
according to a statement.
"It is impossible to predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will persist, and a second wave of cases across 
Europe in late autumn, when the annual flu season commences, is our biggest fear right now," the Dublin-based 
company said.
There's Brexit too
Ryanair, which restarted timetabled flights on July 1, said the crisis could create opportunities as travel remains 
depressed for two or three years, pushing carriers with higher costs to slash capacity. At the same time, it said the 
fiscal year through March 2021 will be challenging, with the further threat of "adverse trading consequences" from 
the UK, its biggest market, leaving the European Union without a trade deal.
The Irish company said it plans to operate about 40 per cent of its normal schedule this month, rising to 60 per 
cent in August and 70 per cent in September if there are no immediate setbacks, though the resumption is already 
under threat from Britain reinstating quarantine rules for people arriving from Spain over the weekend.
Shares of Dublin-based Ryanair have declined 25 per cent this year, the second-smallest drop in the six-member 
Bloomberg EMEA Airlines Index after rival discounter Wizz Air Holdings Plc.
CEO Michael O'Leary has said a fare battle may be on the cards as airlines chase market share in the wake of the 
Covid-19 outbreak. Ryanair could also pick up traffic as network carriers like Deutsche Lufthansa AG slim down 
their fleets and workforce to rein in costs.
A second wave of COVID-19 cases can hit airlines hard
Keep deep job cuts at bay
O'Leary has announced some of the smallest job cuts in the industry after reaching deals with unions in the UK, 
Austria and Ireland, with pilots and cabin crews taking temporary pay cuts over as many as four years.
Still, the CEO has railed against heftier bailout for the likes of Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, saying they'll distort 
the market and allow operators to compete where they'd otherwise be unable to do so.
Ryanair, which has 135 Boeing Co. 737 Max jets on order, reiterated that it still wants to take them even after the 
model was grounded following two fatal crashes.

Wizz Air (W6, Budapest) has appealed to the European Commission to end the suspension of the "use it or lose it" 
rule governing slots at the bloc's airports as it "hinders its development". "I call on the European Commission to end 
the 80-20 slot-waiver regulation for all airlines in Europe as of October 25 and support the recovery of the aviation 
sector and the associated industries by allowing genuine market conditions to prevail," Chief Executive József 
Váradi wrote. Not hiding his ambitions to take over some of these slots, Váradi argued that the proposed extension 
of the rule waiver through March 2021 would protect "incumbent airlines with weak business models" and hinder 
those which are "ready to take up new market opportunities", such as Wizz Air. "An extension of the waiver would 
be irrational and anti-competitive and would hinder rather than help the recovery of the EU aviation industry... 
Furthermore, this would adversely affect the economies of the cities served by those airports, as the airports would 
suffer a shortfall in passenger numbers, reducing everything from their own employment requirements to local 
supply chains," Váradi went on. 
In March this year, the European Union suspended the "use it or lose it" rule, which normally mandates that a slot 
be taken away from an airline if not used on 20% or more days during one IATA season. The move was ostensibly 
to prevent airlines from running environmentally and commercially wasteful "ghost flights" with no passengers solely 
for the purpose of maintaining the minimum slot usage threshold. While the suspension is currently valid through 
the end of the Summer 2020 season, European lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E) appealed in late June to 
extend the waiver through at least the end of the Winter 2020/21 season and possibly even through July 2021. The 
association's Chairman and the Chief Executive of Air France-KLM, Ben Smith, recently reaffirmed this appeal, 
stating that the built-up portfolios of slots were "the bedrock" of the airlines' business models and the foundation for 
their long-term fleet and network planning. While Wizz Air's largest rival LCCs Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) and easyJet 
(U2, London Luton) are members of the A4E, the Hungarian carrier itself is not a member of either A4E or any other 
bloc-wide lobby group.

       Low fares airline Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported Monday that its first-quarter net loss 
attributable to equity holders of parent was 185 million euros, compared to last year's profit of 243 million euros.
 Loss per share was 0.1694 euro, compared to profit of 0.2136 euro a year ago.
 Revenue fell 95 percent to 125 million euros from last year's 2.31 billion euros. The company noted that an 85 
percent reduction in costs during the quarter was not sufficient to offset this revenue loss.
 The passenger traffic fell 99 percent to 0.5 million passengers from last year's 41.5 million passengers. Load factor 
was 61 percent, down from 96 percent a year ago.
 The company noted that over 99 percent of the fleet was grounded from mid-March to end June as EU 
Governments imposed flight or travel bans following the Covid-19 pandemic. During this time, the group airlines 
operated repatriation, rescue &medical; emergency flights.
 On July 1, the company resumed flights across the majority of its route network.
 Looking ahead, Ryanair expects to record a smaller loss in the second quarter than in the first quarter, reflecting a 
gradual return to flying from July 1.
 The company expects to operate approximately 40 percent of its normal July schedule, rising to about 60 percent 
in August and, hopefully, 70 percent in September.
 Further, at this time, the company expects fiscal 2021 traffic to fall by 60 percent to just 60 million from 149 million 
last year.
Ryanair Slips To Loss In Q1 As Traffic Plunges; Sees Sequentially Smaller Loss In Q2
 "..the Ryanair Group will emerge from the Covid-19 crisis with a much lower cost base, which will be essential to 
fund lower fares as the Group competes against unlawfully State aided flag carriers," the company noted.
 Further updates will be provided at Ryanair's AGM in September.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) reported premarket Monday a Q1 net loss of EUR0.17 ($0.20) per share, compared 
with earnings of EUR0.21 per share in the prior-year period.
Operating revenue declined by 95% to EUR125 million as traffic fell from 42 million to just 500,000 passengers in 
the June quarter, according to the Irish low-cost carrier.
The airline said that it expects to operate approximately 40% of its normal schedule in July and 60% in August. It is 
aiming to operate 70% of its normal schedule in September as flight restrictions begin to ease.
Ryanair also said it expects passenger traffic in FY2021 to contract by 60% to 60 million.
"FY21 will be a very challenging year for the Ryanair Group of airlines. It is impossible to predict how long the 
Covid-19 pandemic will persist, and a 2nd wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe in late autumn (when the annual 
flu season commences) is our biggest fear right now," the company said.

Travel stocks weigh on FTSE as world battles second wave

Highlight: UK stock market pulled lower by plunging travel shares as China and Australia battle growing numbers 
of coronavirus cases and the UK restricting holidaymakers travelling to Spain.
Body
UK equities were weighed down by tumbling travel stocks this morning as Asia and Australia deal with what is 
feared to be an aggressive second wave of coronavirus infections and UK holidaymakers face two weeks 
quarantine on return from Spain.
The FTSE 100 dropped 25 points, or 0.4%, to leave the main index standing just over the 6,000 mark at 6,098 as it 
was dragged down by International Consolidated Airlines (IAG). 
The British Airways owner slumped to the bottom of the blue chips after losing 9.4%, or 18p, to trade at 179p. It was 
followed by aerospace engineer Rolls-Royce (RR), which fell 5.1% to 254p and hotel chain InterContinental Hotel 
Group (IHG), which dropped 3.4% to £36.39.
Travel stocks on the mid-cap FTSE 250 feared even worse, with holiday operator Tui (TUI) slumping 13.1%, or 
44p, to 294p. Budget airline EasyJet (EZJ), tumbled 12.1%, or 71p, to 517p, and cruise operator Carnival (CCL) 
fell 8.2% to 875p.
Ireland’s Ryanair (RYA) fell 6.4% to €10.20 after it cut its annual passenger target by a quarter on fears of a 
second wave of Covid-19, although it registered a smaller-than-expected loss during the April-June lockdown with a 
€185m loss in the quarter.
The travel industry is facing a further blow as cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. Mainland China is suffering the 
biggest increase in months, with 57 new cases in the western region of Xinjiang on Sunday, the most since March.
Hong Kong is also expected to announce a ban on dining out and compulsory facemask use in public as numbers 
climb.
In Australia, the state of Victoria has reported a national record of 532 cases in one day despite being halfway 
through a six-week lockdown.
The UK government heaped further pressure on the travel industry by deeming Spain no longer ‘safe’ for UK 
holidaymakers to travel to, dashing hopes of a semi-normal holiday season for Brits.
Travel stocks weigh on FTSE as world battles second wave
Fiona Cincotta, analyst at City Index, said removing Spain from the safe travel list ‘highlights the fluid nature of the 
pandemic and how vulnerable countries are to a second wave as soon as international travel ramps up’.  
Fears that a second wave of infections and the subsequent lockdowns will derail the global recovery saw investors 
pile into gold, taking it to an all-time high of $1,930 an ounce.
‘Always a sign of trouble, gold continued its red-hot streak on Monday,’ said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. 
‘The safe-haven commodity [is] looking mighty attractive after another troubling weekend of Covid-19 and US-China 
headlines.’

distancing signage stick out from the sand in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, Sunday, July 26, 2020. Britain has put

Photo/Joan Mateu)LONDON (AP) — European budget airline Ryanair said Monday that the COVID-19 pandemic 
has wreaked havoc on its earnings, with lockdown restrictions leading to a 99% drop in passengers in the first 
quarter, and warned travel is likely to remain subdued for years. 
The airline, which grew in recent years to become the region's busiest carrier, says the quarter was the 'most 
challenging'' in its history, with a loss of 185 million euros ($216 million). It described a second wave of COVID-19 
as its 'biggest fear.' Travel restrictions led to a collapse in the number of travellers, with 500,000 passengers in the 
first quarter compared with 41.9 million in the same period last year. The low-cost carrier expects air travel to be 
depressed in Europe for the next two to three years. Ryanair shares fell 4% on Monday. The stock price of other 
European travel and tourism companies also got slammed on concerns about new travel restrictions in Europe to 
deal with a flare-up in contagions in some parts of the region, particularly Spain. Shares were down some 13% in 
tour operator TUI, by over 8% in British Airways parent company IAG and 10% in budget airline easyJet. The British 
government this weekend imposed a 14-day quarantine on travelers arriving from Spain, Norway ordered a 10-day 
quarantine for people returning from the entire Iberian peninsula, and France urged its citizens not to visit Spain's 
Catalonia region.20 Stocks to Sell Now[1]Most people know that brokerage rankings are overstated because of 
pressure from publicly-traded companies. No investor relations person wants to see "hold" and "sell" ratings issued 
for their stock. In reality, a "buy" rating really means "hold." "Hold" ratings really mean "sell" and "sell" ratings mean 
get out while you still can. If Wall Street's top analysts are consistently giving "hold" and "sell" ratings to a stock, you 
know there's a serious problem. We've compiled a list of the companies that Wall Street's top equities research 
analysts are consistently giving "hold" and "sell" ratings too. If you own one of these stocks, consider getting out 
while there's still time. This slide show lists the 20 companies that have the lowest average analyst

Jul 27, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  GENEVA —The coronavirus 
pandemic 'continues to accelerate', with a doubling of cases over the last six weeks, the World Health Organization 
chief says. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says nearly 16 million cases have now been 
reported to the U.N. health agency, with more than 640,000 deaths worldwide. Tedros will convene on Thursday 
WHO's emergency committee, a procedural requirement six months after the agency's declaration of a public health 
emergency of international concern, made on Jan. 30 for the coronavirus outbreak. 
The panel will advise him on the pandemic. 'COVID-19 has changed our world,' he told reporters from WHO's 
Geneva headquarters on Monday. 'It has brought people, communities and nations together — and driven them 
apart.' He cited some factors that have proven effective in some countries, including political leadership, education, 
increased testing and hygiene and physical distancing measures. 'We are not prisoners of the pandemic. Every 
single one of us can make a difference,' Tedros said. 'The future is in our hands.' ___ HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED

diplomacy facing pushback as virus caseloads surge — White House, Senate GOP try again on $1 trillion virus aid

____ HERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: (Ad) After a disappointing 2019, cannabis stocks have come roaring 
back to life this year. One red-hot stock shot up 210.7% in 5 days on news of stronger-than-expected sales due to 
Covid-19. Another was up 127% in 60 days, and another jumped 128%. Yet one particular 'seed to sales' company 
could end up being the next cannabis blockbuster. LONDON — Budget airline Ryanair says the COVID-19 
pandemic has wreaked havoc on its bottom line, with pandemic travel restrictions leading to a 99% drop in 
passengers in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. The airline called the quarter the 'most 
challenging'' in its history, with a loss of 185 million euros ($216 million). It described a second wave of COVID-19 
as its 'biggest fear.' Travel restrictions led to a contraction of travelers, with 500,000 passengers in the first quarter 
compared with 41.9 million in the same period last year. The low-cost carrier expects air travel to be depressed in 
Europe for the next two to three years. Ryanair shares fell 4% in early trading. Shares in other European travel and 
tourism companies also got slammed on Monday, with TUI down some 13%, British Airways' parent company by 
more than 8% and easyJet 10%. ___ BRUSSELS — Belgian health authorities say cases of COVID-19 are growing 
at an alarming rate amid a surge of infections in the port city of Antwerp. According to the latest figures released 
Monday, confirmed cases rose 71% for the week of July 17-23 compared to the previous week, with 47% of the 
The Latest: WHO : Coronavirus cases double over past 6 weeks
cases detected in the Antwerp province. Numbers were also going up in the rest of the county, with an average of 
about 279 new confirmed cases per day. Authorities also noted an increase of 30% in people admitted to hospital. 
Belgium, a country with 11.5 million, has been particularly hit by the virus, with more than 66,000 cases confirmed 
including 9,821 deaths. The government tightened restrictions last week, making the use of face masks mandatory 
in crowded outdoor spaces while requiring bar and restaurant owners to register contact details of customers. 
Another meeting of the national security council is taking place Monday and Belgian Prime minister Sophie Wilmes 
is expected to announce further measures that could include reducing the so-called 'social bubbles' to a maximum 
of 10 people from the current 15. ___ PARIS — Morocco is banning all travel to and from some of its major cities to 
try to stem a small spike in coronavirus cases, even though the North African country has remained less impacted 
than its European neighbors to the north. As of Monday morning, a joint statement from the Moroccan Health and 
Interior Ministries quoted by MAP state news agency said that there is a 'ban' on travel affecting the cities of 
Tangier, Tetouan, Fez, Meknes, Casablanca, Berrechid, Settat and the popular tourist destination of Marrakech. 
The statement adds that exceptions to this include 'people with urgent medical needs' and workers on specific 
missions who will need a travel permit issued by a local authority. The ministries said the decision was made 
because many Moroccans were not complying with measures encouraged by the governments to fight the spread 
of the coronavirus, such as social distancing, the wearing of masks and the use of disinfectants. Morocco has 
confirmed 20,278 cases and a relatively low 313 deaths from the virus. ___ HONG KONG — Hong Kong will ban 
dining at restaurants completely and mandate masks in all public places, as the city battles a worsening coronavirus 
outbreak that has infected over 1,000 people in the last two weeks. The tightened measures will be effective for one 
week from Wednesday. They are an extension of a previous ban on eating at restaurants and eateries after 6 p.m., 
as well as making it mandatory to wear masks on public transport. A ban on public gatherings of more than four 
people has also been furthered tightened, with gatherings limited to two people. Bars, beauty salons and 
amusement game centers will remain closed, and swimming pools and sports venues will be closed from 
Wednesday. Eateries and restaurants will be allowed to provide takeout services to customers. 'This is so far the 
most challenging, the most critical wave of transmission Hong Kong. So the next two to three weeks will be critical, 
we need to prevent the further spread of the disease in the community.' said Matthew Cheung, Hong Kong's chief 
secretary for administration. The city has reported 2,634 infections as of Sunday. The government on Monday 
announced that two more patients had died, taking the coronavirus death toll in Hong Kong to 20. Over the last two 
weeks, 1,164 people were infected with the coronavirus, a majority of which were locally transmitted. The surge in 
cases is the highest in Hong Kong so far, after the city reported several weeks of no locally transmitted cases in the 
months of May and June. ___ ISLAMABAD — Pakistan hit another low in COVID-19 deaths with 20 in the last 24 
hours, the lowest daily increase since mid-June. 'This is 87% reduction in COVID-19 related deaths,' Dr. Zafar 
Mirza, special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan, tweeted Monday. Pakistan's daily infections also continued 
to drop with just 1,176 new cases reported in the past 24 hours. Since records began in March, Pakistan has 
recorded 274,288 infections with 241,026 people having recovered from COVID-19. Still with the Muslim holy day of 
Eid-ul Adha later this week, Mirza said despite the encouraging and consistent drop in infections there is 'no place 
for complacency.' Pakistan saw its last spike in cases following the earlier holiday of Eid-al Fitr. Khan and his 
coronavirus team credit their success against the virus to so-called smart lockdowns, quickly quarantining infection 
hot spots. At one point, more than 800 hot spots, including markets and residential areas throughout the country, 
had been on lockdown. Khan ignored those who wanted a complete lockdown, which he said threatened the 
poorest. Pakistan's poverty rate before the pandemic hovered at around 30%. Economists say it has climbed to 
40% since March.  ___ NEW DELHI — As India recorded nearly 50,000 fresh cases of the coronavirus, Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi prepared to launch facilities in three major cities to significantly ramp up testing capacity. 
The 49,931 cases reported on Monday brought India's tally to beyond 1.4 million. India has the world's third-highest 
caseload after the United States and Brazil. The 32,771 reported deaths from the disease in India, however, mark a 
far lower fatality rate than in the other two countries. Modi's office says the testing facilities that will begin operating 
on Monday will help authorities track the virus. They will be put in Noida, a suburb of the capital New Delhi, and in 
the cities of Mumbai and Kolkata. Each is capable of analyzing as many as 10,000 tests per day. India's chief 
medical research agency says the country tested about 515,000 samples for COVID-19 on Sunday. ___ 
JOHANNESBURG — South Africa is reporting more than 11,000 new confirmed coronavirus cases as the country 
now has more than 445,000 in all, including more than 6,700 deaths.  South Africa has the world's fifth largest 
caseload and makes up more than half the cases across the African continent. President Cyril Ramaphosa says the 
recovery from the pandemic will be 'long and difficult' but experts say the worst is yet to come.  A growing concern 
The Latest: WHO : Coronavirus cases double over past 6 weeks
is poorly resourced Eastern Cape province, which makes up 16% of the country's cases but more than 20% of 
deaths. South Africa's public labs continue to face testing delays, with the average turnaround time for results at 
just over a week. ___ SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea reported 25 new cases of COVID-19, bringing its 
caseload to 14,175 infections and 299 deaths. South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 
Monday said 16 of the new cases were tied to people arriving from abroad. The country in past days have reported 
dozens of cases among crew members of a Russia-flagged cargo ship docked in the southern port of Busan and 
hundreds of South Korean construction workers airlifted from virus-ravaged Iraq. Among the nine local 
transmissions, eight were from the Seoul metropolitan area, which has been at the center of a virus resurgence 
since late May.  ___ BEIJING — China on Monday reported 61 new cases of coronavirus, spread between its 
northeastern and northwestern regions.  The Xinjiang region in the northwest reported 41 new cases, while 
Liaoning and Jilin provinces in the northeast saw a combined total of 16. Another four cases were brought by 
Chinese travelers from outside the country.  No new deaths were reported, leaving the toll from COVID-19 in the 
country at 4,634 among 83,891 cases. A total of 339 people are receiving treatment for the disease, 21 of them in 
serious condition, while 305 people are being monitored in isolation for showing signs of infection or for having 
tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms. The latest outbreaks come as most of the country is 
opening up, with major cities restarting indoor recreation venues and sporting events, albeit without fans in 
attendance. ___ MELBOURNE, Australia — Australia's hard-hit Victoria state on Monday posted a new daily record 
of 532 new COVID-19 cases, and the government leader warned that a lockdown in the city of Melbourne would 
continue while infected people continued to go to work. Melbourne is almost half way through a six-week lockdown 
aimed at curbing community spread of coronavirus. Mask-wearing in Australia's second-largest city became 
compulsory last week. The new cases and six deaths reported on Monday surpasses a previous record of 484 new 
infections reported on Wednesday last week. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said the biggest driver of the new 
infections was people continuing to go to work after showing symptoms. 'This is what is driving these numbers up 
and the lockdown will not end until people stop going to work with symptoms and instead go and get tested,' 
Andrews said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for patience in Victoria. 'There has been significant community 
transmission in Victoria. That will take some time to get on top of,' Morrison said. ————— MANILA, Philippines 
— Vietnam has postponed its hosting of Asia's largest security forum, which includes North Korea, and an annual 
meeting of Southeast Asian foreign ministers by a month to September due to the coronavirus pandemic. Two 
Southeast Asian diplomats said Monday that Vietnam, which leads the Association of Southeast Asian Nations this 
year, hopes to hold face to face meetings in mid-September instead of doing them by online video due to travel 
restrictions if the annual gatherings were to be held as originally scheduled later this week. The 10-nation bloc hosts 
the ASEAN Regional Forum, which brings together its top diplomats with counterparts from the United States, 
China, Japan, Russia, India, the two Koreas and other Asia Pacific countries to discuss the denuclearization of the 
Korean Peninsula and other security issues. Most of about 1,300 ASEAN meetings this year have so far been 
shifted online due to the coronavirus pandemic, including an annual summit of ASEAN leaders last month. More 
sensitive talks, including secretive negotiations between China and ASEAN member states for a so-called 'code of 
conduct' in the disputed South China Sea, have been delayed indefinitely, said the two diplomats, who spoke with 
The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the matter publicly. ___ 
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump won't be throwing out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium next month after 
all. Trump tweeted Sunday that he won't be able to make the trip because of his 'strong focus' on the coronavirus, 
vaccines and the economy. Trump said in the tweet: 'We will make it later in the season!'  He had announced at a 
briefing Thursday on Major League Baseball's opening day that he'd be at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 15 to throw out 
the first pitch. Trump has been trying to show voters that he is taking the virus seriously by holding briefings and 
canceling Republican convention events set for Jacksonville, Florida. Florida is among several states where the 
virus is raging.7 Tech Stocks to Buy Now For a Post Coronavirus Economy[1]The Covid-19 pandemic has created 
a new 'tech wreck'. But unlike the broad selloff at the end of 2018, this downturn has been more selective. Some 
stocks that looked like they were a little overbought have seen their share prices lowered. In some cases, there was 
a legitimate reason for this. However, in other cases, it was likely a result of profit-taking disguised as something 
else. That's the nature of a crisis. It gives investors the cover to do what they wanted to do anyway. But once 
investors start to sell, it can trigger a herd mentality. And that's when savvy investors start to look for opportunities. 
Because as Warren Buffett famously said, 'Be greedy when others are fearful.' Tech stocks will lead the way back 
when the pandemic is over. Because if there's one thing this moment in time is teaching us, it's that we're not going 
to be less dependent on technology. Businesses aren't going to be doing less digital advertising. Consumers aren't 
The Latest: WHO : Coronavirus cases double over past 6 weeks
going to do less e-commerce. But the fundamentals still matter. That's why one of the common traits of many of 
these companies is that they have rock-solid balance sheets. View the "7 Tech Stocks to Buy Now For a Post

sheds 13points Gold at all-time high of US$1,958.40 Travel stocks decline again 9.40am: Renewed woes for travel 
sector The Footsie was wallowing in the red in mid-morning, dipping 13 points to 6,110, while sterling edged 0.3% 
higher to US$1.2833. Airlines were under further pressure after the government imposed a mandatory two-week 
quarantine for travellers coming from Spain after a resurgence in cases in the European country. 'The market is 
now pricing in the risk of restrictions on more countries and thus raising the potential for earnings estimates to be 
downgraded once again for travel-related industries,' said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. 'Many people 
don't want to risk having to go through 14 days of quarantine after their holiday, particularly those who cannot work 
from home, and so it seems likely the Spain-related news will prompt more people to cancel their overseas trip this 
summer. It may also cause more people to think twice about booking a last-minute holiday.' 
Among the airlines, easyJet plc (LON:EZJ) dropped 11% to 523.8p, International Consolidated Airlines Group SA 
(LON:IAG) shed 10% to 179.84p and Ryanair Holdings plc (LON:RYA) lost 6% to €10.20. Holiday package seller 
TUI AG (LON:TUI) slid 13% to 294.47p as competitor On The Beach PLC (LON:OTB) dipped 6% to 268.52p while 
cruise operator Carnival PLC (LON:CCL) was down 7% to 889.87p. 8.45am: Cautious start to the week The FTSE 
100 started in negative territory on Monday as fears over America's economic fate and growing worries over a 
coronavirus (COVID-19) second wave in Europe hit sentiment. The index of UK blue-chip shares shed 17 points to 
6,106.89 early on. Thejitters were more vividly expressed by the headlong rush into gold, a haven asset in times of 
turmoil. The price of the yellow metal hit an all-time high of US$1,958.40, up US$33.20, and is now only a couple of 
sessions away from breaking the US$2,000, based on its current trajectory. A further sign of malaise could be found 
in the dollar, which has been trading at basement levels last seen in 2018. Thursday's US jobless number, which 
unexpectedly rose for the first time since March, led to a nervy assessment of the global economic outlook, not 
helped by Spain's upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Perhaps a tonic may come in the form of another round of 
American fiscal stimulus, which so far has only been hinted at by the Federal Reserve, which meets this week. In 
the meantime, fear will continue to prevail, although the equity markets appear insulated against the latest upsurge 
in nervousnessby the volume of cheap money sloshing around the system, analysts said. On the market, the 
session started positively for the Footsie's precious metals groups - Polymetal (LON:POLY), up 4.5%, and Fresnillo

from Spain
(LON:FRES), ahead 3.5%. The broader mining sector was also in demand, led by Antofagasta (LON:ANTO), 2.4% 
higher, and Glencore (LON:GLEN), which edged 1.2% higher. Follow-through buying after last week's stellar 
trading figures saw B&#38;Q owner Kingfisher (LON:KGF) advance 1.7%. The travel stocks were hard hit by the 
upsurge in coronavirus cases in Spain, which has forced the Foreign Office to pull up the air bridge with the country 
and sparked fears that Europe may be headed for a second wave. British Airways owner IAG (LON:IAG), which on 
Friday said it was mulling a cash call, was down 8.7% early on, with aero engineers Rolls Royce (LON:RR.) and 
Melrose Industries (LON:MLRO) descending in its vapour trails with losses of 3.5% and 3.8% respectively. 
Proactive news headlines: Supply@MECapital PLC (LON:SYME) said discussions are progressing with a large 
financial institution over an inventory monetisation pilot programme in the UK. The target is to start a pilot 
programmeby the end of 2020 with up to 10 UK client companies. A positive outcome may lead to a first self-
funding agreement in the UK, said the AIM-listed company.In  a trading update, Supply@Me added that it is also 
developing a dual-funding approach to its stock monetising platform. Oncimmune Holdings PLC (LON:ONC) said 
there hasbeen a'substantial expansion' of its collaboration with Swiss giant Roche - one which will see the value of 
its contract increase. Theimmunodiagnostics specialist's biomarker discovery platform SeroTag is being used to 
'explore the baseline and on-treatment autoantibody profiles as biomarkers in patients that received cancer 
immunotherapy'. The timeline for the project has not changed, with initial results to be provided to Roche within 
three months of completion in November. Location Sciences Group PLC (LON:LSAI) has reported higher revenues 
in the first six months of the year and lower losses asit worksto offset the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) 
pandemic on some of its business lines. In a trading update coveringthe six months to June 30, 2020, the location 
data verification specialist said it expects to report revenues of around 650,000, 43% higher than the prior year, 
alongside an adjusted cash EBITDA loss of 680,000 compared to an 820,000 loss in 2019. Panther Metals PLC 
(LON:PALM) has acquired 135 mining claim cells, increasing the total area of the Dotted Lake gold project by 
346%. The Dotted Lake property is situated in Canada, approximately 16 kilometres north of Barrick Gold 
Corporation's renowned Hemlo gold mine. The new claim acquisition constitutes a strategic expansion in an area 
renowned for gold discoveries and gold production over the last 40 years. ImmuPharma PLC(LON:IMM, FRA: 25I) 
has said its licensing partner has submitted a special protocol assessment (SPA) request to the US regulators 
ahead of a phase III clinical trial of its lupus drug. The SPA is a process by which the US Food &#38; Drug 
Administration and Avion Pharmaceuticals will decide on the design and size of the study that will both meet the 
scientific and regulatory requirements and supports marketing approval for Lupuzor. The review period for an SPA 
request is up to 45 days, said ImmuPharma, which has been working with Avion to finalise a new optimised 
international protocol. City Pub Group Plc (LON:CPC) said ithas traded profitably since early July as pubs began to 
reopen their doors following the easing of lockdown restrictions in the UK. In a trading update for the three weeks 
since July 4, 2020, the company said itreopened 24 of its 48 pubs on thatday, with another eight reopening over the 
last two weeks taking the total to 32. The firm said its pubs have delivered 'an encouraging performance to date' 
since opening their doors again, with its remaining branches expected to reopen within the next two months or 
earlier if social distancing measures are relaxed further. Total sales for the three week period were 1.8mln, around 
63% of previous levels on a like-for-like basis, while City Pub said 'significant reductions' in costs and operational 
efficiencies had allowed it to trade profitably and generate cash. IQ-AI Limited (LON:IQAI) said its subsidiary, 
Imaging Biometrics (IB), has reported that the development of IB Stroke, a product designed to use algorithms to 
generate information commonly used to diagnose strokes in patients, is currently on track. The company also said a 
subcommittee of the USA Jumpstarting Brain Tumour Drug Development Coalition has recently recommended that 
the quantitative perfusion capability, exclusive to IB, provides a singular foundation upon which to build IB Stroke 
and is now the consensus recommended standard for the National Clinical Trials Network. Supermarket Income 
REIT PLC (LON:SUPR), the grocery chain property specialist, has acquired the Tesco Extra store in Newmarket, 
Suffolk for 61mln. The site comprises a 68,000 square foot net sales area with a 12-pump petrol filling station, 654 
parking spaces andpurpose-builtonline fulfilment distribution docks that support Tesco's online grocery business 
across the region. The Tesco store is being acquired from the Standard Life Pooled Property Fund on a yield of 
4.6% with an unexpired lease term of 16 years with annual, upward-only rent reviews. The company also saidit has 
arranged a new revolving credit facility of 60mln with Wells Fargo. This secured, interest-only, RCF has aninitial 
five-year term and two further one-year extension options. Savannah Resources PLC (LON:SAV) said areport has 
found that its Mina do Barroso lithium project could contribute nearly €1.2bn to the gross output of Portugal, 
including €168mln during its construction phase and €90mln per year during the operating phase. The report was

from Spain
written by a team of economists from the prestigious University of Minho, based in the city of Braga, approximately 
80 kilometres away from Mina do Barroso. The economic analysis drew on the results of a 2018 scoping study on 
the project. The report also said that Mina do Barroso would boost Portugal's annual export revenue from metal 
ores by 20% with its projected €110mln per year of lithium sales. Echo Energy PLC (LON:ECHO, the Latin 
American-focused upstream oil and gas company, has announced the conditional placing of new ordinary shares in 
the company to raise gross proceeds of 475,000. The comp[any said it has conditionally issued 95,000,000 new

and the dollar slumped to a low against a basket of currencies amid worries over the deteriorating economic outlook 
for the world's largest economy. At 6.20am, the yellow metal was changing hands for US$1,956.20, up US$31 in a 
fairly busy opening session in Asia on Monday. On the current trajectory, the price should quicklypierce the 
US$2,000 mark predicted by Citi earlier this month. Gold, a go-to in times of uncertainty, continued to react to US 
jobless claims, which rose unexpectedly and for the first time since March, while the American currency dropped to 
levels not seen for two years. Striking an upbeat note amid a chorus of worries, CMC Markets analyst David 
Madden pointed to the experience of Europe in recent weeks as it has tackled the worst the coronavirus pandemic. 
'One thing we did learn last week was that the rebound in economic activity in France, Germany and the UK has 
continued apace through June and July, with improvements in both manufacturing and services sector activity, 
which offers hope that these economies could well outperform the US economy, in the weeks and months ahead, 
second virus spikes notwithstanding,' he pointed out. However, he dampened the mood a little by acknowledging 
that eyes are all now trained firmly on Spain, where worries are growing over a potential second wave. Against this 
backdrop, the FTSE 100 looks set for a benign start to the trading week with traders calling the UK blue-chip index 
to open 6points higher at 6,129.89 having dropped 87 points on Friday. Looking ahead, seven of the UK's 10 
biggest blue-chip companies report in the coming week, plus four of the five big banks and, across the Atlantic, tech 
titans including Apple and Alphabet will provide quarterly updates. TheFootsie giants spread across the global 
pharma, commodities and consumer goods industries, so their updates are is likely to provide a crucial litmus test 
for the health of the global economy and the direction for equity markets for the coming weeks. And with Wall Street 
watchers worrying about a bubble as earnings season rolls round to include two of the world's largest companies 
and a Federal Reserve policy statement, it's undoubtedly a compelling week for finance fans. Around the markets

Ryanair set to close German bases after pilots reject pay deal
Ryanair set to close German bases after pilots reject pay deal

Ryanair is to close its base at Frankfurt Hahn Airport, and bases at Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf airports are likely 
to shut down at the end of the summer after German pilots rejected proposed pay cuts, the Irish airline said on 
Tuesday.
The moves, which will include an undisclosed number of pilot job cuts, come after a slight majority of German pilots 
voted against a proposed deal of savings that Ryanair said were required by COVID-19 disruption.
"We must move on with alternative measures to deliver savings, which regrettably will mean base closures and 
dismissals," Ryanair said in a memo to German pilots seen by Reuters.
The airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, said in the memo that 70% of its pilots across Europe had already 
accepted cuts to pay and conditions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Ireland, management bypassed the union and got pilots to accept the new conditions individually.
In Austria, Ryanair announced the closure of the Vienna base of subsidiary Lauda before doing a deal with some 
pilots to save it weeks later.
German union Vereinigung Cockpit, in a statement released before Ryanair announced the base closures, said it 
believed there was still scope to resolve the dispute.
"We are not giving up hope. The employer would be well advised to get back to the negotiating table quickly now," it 
said.
Ryanair set to close German bases after pilots reject pay deal
But it reiterated its opposition to the deal offered by Ryanair, saying the duration of the offered job security would 
have been until March 2021 whereas pay cuts were demanded until 2024.
Ryanair said it would stop basing planes at Frankfurt Hahn Airport from the start of November, with pilots at the 
base to receive letters with details of their notice period this week.
Pilots at Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf "are likely to close" in advance of the winter season, with details to be 
provided next week, the statement said.
Once the closures have been completed, Ryanair will look to cut pilots based at Frankfurt, Cologne, Berlin 
Schoenefeld airports through a collective dismissal process.
Other cost-saving measures include changing rosters and freezing promotions and base transfers, it said. (Reuters)

Jul 22, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  The coronavirus 
death toll in the United States has spiked again with President Donald Trump conceding the pandemic crisis is likely 
to get worse, as governments across Asia and Europe battled second waves of infections.Australia set a new daily 
high of 500 cases on Wednesday, likewise Hong Kong broke its record, and infections were also on the rise in 
Tokyo and Belgium -- all four had managed to dampen down infection rates months ago. Vehicles move toward the 
entrance of Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium, which houses the busiest COVID-19 testing site in the United States, 
with about 6,500 tests administered daily Photo: AFPTV / Sbastien VUAGNAT Belgian officials urged people to take 
precautions to halt a "snowball effect before it provokes a new avalanche" of a virus that has now killed 615,000 
people globally from almost 15 million infections.Almost a quarter of those deaths have been in the US, the worst-
hit nation after a haphazard response dominated by Trump's repeated attempts to play down the severity of the 
crisis.Almost 1,000 deaths confirmed on Tuesday, the highest daily nationwide death toll in weeks, Trump adopted 
a newly serious tone. Countries with fragile health systems have yet to enjoy even a brief reprieve from the virus 
Photo: afp / Erika SANTELICES "It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better," the president told 
reporters, although he did repeat his assertion that the disease would somehow eventually "disappear".In a further 
sign that the US is taking the virus more seriously, the government has agreed to pay almost $2 billion for 100 
million doses of a potential vaccine being developed by German firm BioNTech and US giant Pfizer.

the true number could be much higher. Photo: AFP / Punit PARANJPE  The crisis has left tens of millions 
unemployed around the world and crippled global commerce, prompting the European Union to agree an 
unprecedented 750 billion euro ($858 billion) aid package for the hardest-hit member countries earlier this week.

Saeed KHAN The firm, which is looking to shed 3,000 staff in total, said the pilot's union had "voted for job cuts and 
base closures when they could have preserved all jobs".The production of a vaccine is now key to ensuring a return 
to something close to normality -- for businesses and the general public.More than 200 candidate drugs are being

developed with 23 having progressed to clinical trials. Donald Trump warns that the coronavirus crisis in the United 
States is likely to "get worse before it gets better" at his first formal White House virus briefing since the end of April. 
He encouraged mask wearing "whether you like the mask or not." Photo: AFPTV / One leading candidate is being 
developed in part by pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, with promising results from clinical trials published on 
Monday.But the firm's chief said on Tuesday a global rollout was not imminent."We hope to be able to produce a 
vaccine by the end of the year... perhaps a little earlier if all goes well," said Pascal Soriot.With the sporting world 
just about getting back on its feet, Olympic officials conceded on Wednesday that their hopes of holding the Tokyo 
2020 Games next year rested on a vaccine being developed."If things continue as they are now, we couldn't" hold 
the Games, said local organising committee president Yoshiro Mori.While global efforts to prevent new infections 
are the principal concern of policymakers, the extent and severity of the disease among poorer communities was 
becoming clearer.India past the one-million infections milestone last week, but new data on Wednesday suggested 
a vast underestimate.An Indian study showed almost a quarter of the population in New Delhi had contracted the 
virus, equating to roughly five million infections in the capital city.Officials have registered just 125,000 confirmed 
cases.Meanwhile, for those who recover from the disease, the path back to full health is not always 
straightforward.The illness left her temporarily unable to speak."Intensive care was awful. But now I'm feeling 
marvelous," she told AFP during her recovery. "I'm going to bake a giant cake for everyone."

Jul 22, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-frills 
airline Ryanair plans to close its Frankfurt-Hahn base in Germany -- and other hubs could follow after German pilots 
voted against pay cuts, it emerged on Wednesday.Ryanair, which is seeking to axe 3,000 jobs due to a 
coronavirus-induced collapse in travel demand, revealed its plan in a memo sent on Tuesday to Germany-based 
pilots.The Dublin-based carrier blamed their trade union VC, whose members voted in favour of rejecting its 
proposed 20-percent pay cut over four years."VC wrote to us... (on Monday) confirming that, following a ballot of 
members, this emergency agreement on cost savings and job protection was rejected since only 49.4 percent voted 
in favour," Ryanair said in the memo obtained by AFP on Wednesday.It added: "The VC (has) voted for job cuts 
and base closures when they could have preserved all jobs."We must move on with alternative measures to deliver 
cost savings, which regrettably will mean base closures and dismissals." Ryanair is seeking to axe 3,000 jobs due 
to a coronavirus-induced collapse in travel demand Photo: dpa / Thomas Frey Ryanair added that its Frankfurt-
Hahn hub, some 120 kilometres (75 miles) west of Germany's financial capital, would close with effect from 
November 1, but did not specify the number of job losses. 
The carrier also warned its bases in Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf were likely to be closed before winter.In reaction, 
the VC union said the proposed cutbacks would harm members and offer inadequate job security -- and it urged 
fresh talks."We are not giving up hope. The employer would be well advised to quickly get back to the negotiating 
table now," VC added in a statement.In contrast earlier this month, Ryanair's British pilots agreed 20-percent pay 
cuts to save 260 jobs that the airline had wanted to axe.Ryanair's four divisions comprise its main Irish operations, 
Austrian-based Lauda, Polish unit Buzz, and Malta Air.

subsidiary Malta Air (AL, Malta Int'l), which employs the pilots stationed in Germany, took part in the vote last week, 
49.4% of whom were in favour of accepting the agreement, the union said in a statement on July 21 before the 
carrier issued its memo. The employer had presented the choice as no longer negotiable, the union said, namely 
that more than 170 pilots in Germany would be sacked if new contracts were not agreed, including "flexible short-
time work, remuneration only for hours flown, but at a drastically reduced daily rate and hourly rate and all this while 
increasing productivity."

The state-owned operator of Berlin's airports plans to cut 400 jobs, as the aviation industry reels from the effects of 
the coronavirus pandemic.
Significant cuts are necessary in the areas of administration and operations, according to a letter to employees 
seen by dpa on Wednesday.
"We estimate that 400 jobs will be cut in the next few years," airport chief Engelbert Luetke Daldrup and head of 
human resources Michael Halberstadt wrote.
The company currently employs around 2,170 people.
Dismissals for operational reasons are to be avoided "under all circumstances," the letter states, adding that senior 
executives and managing directors are to waive 10 per cent of their salary in a bid to cut costs.
Talks on job cuts are to get under way with the supervisory board, the works council and the Verdi union. A video 
conference is planned for Friday to give employees the opportunity to ask questions.
The Berlin airport operator, Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH, is not the only company in the air travel industry 
tightening its belt.
The operator of Frankfurt Airport, Germany's biggest air hub, expects to reduce its workforce of 22,500 by 3,000-
4,000 in the coming years.
Many airlines are also downsizing, including EasyJet, the biggest client for Berlin airports.
EasyJet intends to cut 30 per cent of its workforce worldwide and pull its aircraft out of Berlin.
Hundreds of job cuts planned at Berlin airports due to virus
On Tuesday, an internal memo seen by dpa said budget airline Ryanair plans to close its base at Frankfurt Hahn 
Airport and is considering doing the same in Berlin Tegel.
"Aviation and in turn airports are in the midst of the worst crisis in their history since World War II," the letter to 
Berlin airport employees said.
The German capital's two currently operating airports - a new one is scheduled to open after a long delay in 
October - are operating well below their usual capacity. Tegel and Schoenefeld airports have seen passenger 
numbers plummet to about 20-25 per cent of pre-crisis levels.

Jul 22, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  The 
coronavirus death toll in the United States has spiked again with President Donald Trump conceding the pandemic 
crisis is likely to get worse, as governments across Asia and Europe battled second waves of infections. Australia 
set a new daily high of 500 cases on Wednesday, likewise Hong Kong broke its record, and infections were also on 
the rise in Tokyo and Belgium -- all four had managed to dampen down infection rates months ago.Belgian officials 
urged people to take precautions to halt a "snowball effect before it provokes a new avalanche" of a virus that has 
now killed 615,000 people globally from almost 15 million infections. Almost a quarter of those deaths have been in 
the US, the worst-hit nation after a haphazard response dominated by Trump's repeated attempts to play down the 
severity of the crisis. 
Almost 1,000 deaths confirmed on Tuesday, the highest daily nationwide death toll in weeks, Trump adopted a 
newly serious tone.  Countries with fragile health systems have yet to enjoy even a brief reprieve from the virus afp / 
Erika SANTELICES "It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better," the president told reporters, 
although he did repeat his assertion that the disease would somehow eventually "disappear". In a further sign that 
the US is taking the virus more seriously, the government has agreed to pay almost $2 billion for 100 million doses 
of a potential vaccine being developed by German firm BioNTech and US giant Pfizer. A health worker prepares to

Jul 22, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  The 
number of coronavirus infections around the world passed 15 million on Wednesday with more than a quarter of 
those cases in the United States, where President Donald Trump warned that the pandemic was likely to get worse 
before it gets better. The US data makes grim reading with more than 140,000 fatalities and regular daily death tolls 
of more than 1,000, yet Trump repeated his claim late on Tuesday that the pandemic would somehow 
"disappear".Trump has been a critic of lockdown measures and has argued in favour of reopening the economy 
even as death tolls have climbed. Signs are emerging in other parts of the world that the virus quickly springs back 
when lockdown measures are lifted. 
Countries with fragile health systems have yet to enjoy even a brief reprieve from the virus afp / Erika SANTELICES 
Australia, Belgium, Hong Kong and Japanese capital Tokyo had all used restrictive measures to successfully beat 
outbreaks earlier in the pandemic, but all are now facing an upsurge in cases. Australia and Hong Kong set new 
daily records for confirmed cases on Wednesday and Tokyo's governor urged residents to stay at home during a 
forthcoming holiday as cases climb.  Belgian officials said people must stick to social-distancing guidelines to halt a 
"snowball effect before it provokes a new avalanche". A health worker prepares to collect a swab sample from a

However, one of the more controversial measures taken by any government -- South Africa's decision to ban the 
sale of alcohol and enforce a curfew -- continued to cause anguish. "What the government has put in place has 
been knee-capping," restaurateur Sean Barber said during a protest in Johannesburg. "It's decimating our industry."

Jul 22, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Irish no-
frills airline Ryanair plans to close its Frankfurt-Hahn base in Germany -- and other hubs could follow after German 
pilots rejected pay cuts, it emerged on Wednesday. Ryanair, which is seeking to axe 3,000 jobs due to a 
coronavirus-induced collapse in travel demand, revealed its plan in a memo sent Tuesday to Germany-based pilots. 
The Dublin-based carrier blamed their trade union VC, whose members voted in favour of rejecting its proposed 20-
percent pay cut over four years. "VC wrote to us... (on Monday) confirming that, following a ballot of members, this 
emergency agreement on cost savings and job protection was rejected since only 49.4 percent voted in favour," 
Ryanair said in the memo obtained by AFP on Wednesday. It added: "The VC (has) voted for job cuts and base 
closures when they could have preserved all jobs. "We must move on with alternative measures to deliver cost 
savings, which regrettably will mean base closures and dismissals." Ryanair added that its Frankfurt-Hahn hub, 
about 120 kilometres (75 miles) west of Germany's financial capital, would close with effect from November 1, but 
did not specify the number of job losses.The carrier also warned its bases in Berlin Tegel and Duesseldorf were 
likely to shut down before winter. In reaction, the VC union said the proposed cutbacks would harm members and 
offer inadequate job security -- and it urged fresh talks. "We are not giving up hope. The employer would be well 
advised to quickly get back to the negotiating table now," VC added in a statement. VC said 170 pilot jobs were 
threatened by the closure of the bases. According to the Verdi trade union 350 cabin crew jobs are at risk, plus a 
third of the 400 employees at the Malta Air subsidiary.  Ryanair's decision "demonstrates the cynicism of a 
company that earns profits from price dumping to the detriment of its staff," said the union, which also called for the 
airline to resume talks. In contrast earlier this month, Ryanair's British pilots agreed 20-percent pay cuts to save 260 
jobs that the airline had wanted to axe.  Ryanair's four divisions comprise its main Irish operations, Austrian-based 
Lauda, Polish unit Buzz, and Malta Air.

Budget airline Ryanair will shutter its base at Frankfurt Hahn Airport and is considering doing the same in Berlin 
Tegel and Weeze Airport near the Dutch border, Ryanair division Malta Air said in an internal memo seen by dpa on 
Tuesday.
The move comes after majority of German pilots voted against a proposed deal of savings including paycuts that 
Ryanair said were required because of disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
"We must move on to deliver savings in other ways and adjust our German operations to tackle the unsustainable 
cost base at our German airports," the Malta Air memo said.
German pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) said late Tuesday that as many as 170 pilots could be affected by 
the decision, adding that negotiations with the airline had not been concluded.
The airline's British-based pilots accepted pay cuts of up to 20 per cent on July 8, with a similar deal announced in 
Ireland five days earlier.
Last week Ryanair announced it would cut "up to 1,000 flights" between Ireland and Britain during August and 
September, blaming the Irish government for its requirement that arrivals self-isolate for 14 days.
Described as Europe's largest airline, Ireland's Ryanair said in May that it would cut 3,000 jobs due to the 
pandemic, which has brought international travel to a near-standstill.
The virus has infected almost 15 million people and killed over 610,000, according to official figures collated by 
Johns Hopkins University.

Competition on routes between Italy and Ukraine is set to heighten over the coming months as more low-cost seats 
enter the fast-growing market.
Wizz Air has become the latest airline move into the Italy-Ukraine market, just weeks after rival Ryanair announced 
its own bold expansion plans between the two countries.
Scheduled capacity on routes between the nations has grown markedly in recent years, rising from 386,176 two-
way seats in 2016 to almost 1.3 million last year. However, with Milan-based Ernest Airlines-the second-largest 
provider of Italy-Ukraine capacity in 2019-ceasing operations in January 2020, Wizz and Ryanair are seeking to 
exploit a gap in the market and ramp up pressure on SkyUp Airlines.
A total of 14 new routes linking the countries are set to be launched by Wizz between now and April 2021, with the 
first four of those set to take off next month. From Aug. 14, the ULCC will connect Kyiv (IEV) with Venice Treviso 
(TSF) and Naples (NAP) three times per week and provide a 2X-weekly link between its new bases in Lviv (LWO) 
and Milan Malpensa (MXP). A 2X-weekly route between LWO and Rome Ciampino (CIA) launches on Aug.16.
Two more routes are being opened in October, with Wizz adding Kharkiv (HRK) and Zaporizhzhia (OZH) from MXP. 
The remaining eight routes join the carrier's network in March 2021. Following the expansion, Wizz will offer 77 
routes to 15 countries from five Ukrainian airports.
"Today's announcement of new routes from Ukraine further underlines our long-term commitment to that market," 
Wizz CCO George Michalopoulos said.
"We are pleased to bring back Italian routes to our Ukrainian network and to offer Ukrainian passengers long-
awaited flights to exciting destinations of Rome, Milan, Venice, Naples, Verona, Catania and Bologna."
Details of Wizz's latest expansion come two weeks after Ryanair said it would launch 16 new routes between 
Ukraine and Italy as part of its winter 2020-21 and summer 2021 schedules. Eleven routes will start at the end of 
October and a further five next March. Data provided by OAG Schedules Analyser shows Ryanair and Wizz will 
compete on seven city pairs.
Italy - Ukraine competition to intensify
This expansion comes on top of Kyiv-based SkyUp Airlines' Italy-Ukraine growth. While the COVID-19 pandemic 
has affected the pace, the latest schedules show the Ukrainian airline intends to have opened 12 new routes by the 
end of 2020, taking the total number it operates between the two countries to 18.
The jockeying for position on Italy-Ukraine routes follows Ernest Airlines' exit from the market. The carrier grounded 
all flights on Jan. 11 after national aviation regulator ENAC suspended its air operator's certificate (AOC).
Ernest operated 528,730 seats between Italy and Ukraine in 2019 across 14 routes, the largest of which connected 
IEV and NAP, a route Wizz is taking over. It was the second biggest operator of Italy-Ukraine capacity behind 
Ukraine International Airlines, which offered 570,094 seats.
SkyUp, meanwhile, will increase its Italy-Ukraine capacity from 65,690 seats in 2019 to about 275,000 this year. 
Ryanair will also offer in excess of 150,000 in 2020.

A total of 14 new routes linking the countries are set to be launched by Wizz between now and April 2021, with the 
first four of those set to take off next month. From Aug. 14, the ULCC will connect Kyiv (IEV) with Venice Treviso 
(TSF) and Naples (NAP) three times per week and provide a 2X-weekly link between its new bases in Lviv (LWO) 
and Milan Malpensa (MXP). A 2X-weekly route between LWO and Rome Ciampino (CIA) launches on Aug.16.
Two more routes are being opened in October, with Wizz adding Kharkiv (HRK) and Zaporizhzhia (OZH) from MXP. 
The remaining eight routes join the carrier's network in March 2021. Following the expansion, Wizz will offer 77 
routes to 15 countries from five Ukrainian airports.
"Today's announcement of new routes from Ukraine further underlines our long-term commitment to that market," 
Wizz CCO George Michalopoulos said.
"We are pleased to bring back Italian routes to our Ukrainian network and to offer Ukrainian passengers long-
awaited flights to exciting destinations of Rome, Milan, Venice, Naples, Verona, Catania and Bologna."
Details of Wizz's latest expansion come two weeks after Ryanair said it would launch 16 new routes between 
Ukraine and Italy as part of its winter 2020-21 and summer 2021 schedules. Eleven routes will start at the end of 
October and a further five next March. Data provided by OAG Schedules Analyser shows Ryanair and Wizz will 
compete on seven city pairs.
Italy - Ukraine competition to intensify
This expansion comes on top of Kyiv-based SkyUp Airlines' Italy-Ukraine growth. While the COVID-19 pandemic 
has affected the pace, the latest schedules show the Ukrainian airline intends to have opened 12 new routes by the 
end of 2020, taking the total number it operates between the two countries to 18.
The jockeying for position on Italy-Ukraine routes follows Ernest Airlines' exit from the market. The carrier grounded 
all flights on Jan. 11 after national aviation regulator ENAC suspended its air operator's certificate (AOC).
Ernest operated 528,730 seats between Italy and Ukraine in 2019 across 14 routes, the largest of which connected 
IEV and NAP, a route Wizz is taking over. It was the second biggest operator of Italy-Ukraine capacity behind 
Ukraine International Airlines, which offered 570,094 seats.
SkyUp, meanwhile, will increase its Italy-Ukraine capacity from 65,690 seats in 2019 to about 275,000 this year. 
Ryanair will also offer in excess of 150,000 in 2020.

 A group of airlines in the UK on Monday urged the government to suspend air passenger duty for 2020 to increase 
demand as the sector tries to recover from the COVID-19 outbreak.
The group including International Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG.L) British Airways, EasyJet (EZJ.L) and 
Ryanair (RYA.L) said the move could help the industry save 45% of lost air routes and up to 8,000 jobs.
Airlines UK said in a release that a flight tax suspension will boost passenger demand by about 12% over the next 
12 months.

Jet2 enhancing travel insurance policies is a market leading way to increase bookings
Jet2 enhancing travel insurance policies is a market leading way to increase 
bookings

Highlight: As flight schedules at Jet2 resumed on the 15 July, it recently announced Covid-19 cover for any new 
policy or existing policy bought after 19 April 2020. The extended cover includes medical cover if Covid-19 is 
contracted abroad, cancellation cover if a member of the travel party tests positive 14 days before the holiday and 
cover for if a traveller is refused boarding due to a raised temperature or positive Covid-19 test.
Body
Many travel insurance policies have excluded Covid-19 as a valid reason for a claim. Travel companies and 
insurance providers are deterring many potential customers by not including this as a valid reason for a claim. 
There is no doubt that traveller priorities will have changed amid Covid-19, where cancellation protection and 
security of any money spent on a holiday will now be the main priorities. 
According to a study by ABTA, 21% of Britons that went on holiday in 2018/2019 travelled without insurance, over a 
third of those surveyed thought they did not need to take out a policy. This is most likely to change due to the 
coronavirus pandemic. It continues Jet2.com's highly regarded status during the pandemicAs a company that 
prides itself on excellent customer service, this perk for customers is another addition that will inspire loyalty. As 
many travel companies have had to allocate refunds for cancelled trips, Jet2.com (including Jet2Holidays) have 
proved to be better than most for this type of service. As it has been highly reported in the media, LCC's such as 
Ryanair and easyJet have failed to provide customers with a timely refund for their cancelled trips. Jet2.com, 
however, has endeavored to make sure that all customers have received a refund within a short time frame. In a 
survey by MoneySavingExpert of 27,000 people in the UK, Jet2Holidays scored 54%, indicating that customers had 
a positive experience with them regarding refunds and cancellations. Comparatively, competitor Ryanair scored -
82%, signifying a mostly negative experience. Another survey by Which? found that 19% of Jet2.com customers did 
not receive a refund, compared to a staggering 84% at Ryanair. This move could encourage other insurance 
providers and operators to followWhere many travellers often forget about travel insurance, it will now be more 
important than ever. By offering Covid-19 protection on insurance policies, it will firstly encourage customers to 
book their selected travel policy. Secondly, it will encourage bookings with the travel operator in other parts of the 
holiday booking process. Other companies that offer travel insurance alongside their main offerings, such as TUI, 
Jet2 enhancing travel insurance policies is a market leading way to increase bookings
will benefit from this. Adaptation to the current market and the 'new normal' is a key contributor for future success 
and a shorter recovery period.

A piece of paper that refereed to a bomb threat was found on a train about 60 kilometres north-east of Oslo, police 
in Norway said on Saturday.
The train, which was parked at a station in the municipality of Eidsvoll, was evacuated. Following a search, police 
found no evidence of any danger.
A similar threat occurred a day before on a Ryanair flight from London to the Norwegian capital.
The scare was prompted by a note found by crew on the flight. The plane landed safely, and a 51-year British 
citizen suspected of being behind the threat was arrested, but then later released.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) unit Lauda will close its German hub in Stuttgart and terminate the contracts of all

A Ryanair aircraft flying from London to Norway has landed safely at Oslo's main airport after receiving a bomb 
threat while in the air and a suspect has been arrested, Norwegian police said on Friday.
Danish F-16 military aircraft scrambled to escort the plane to Norway, The Danish Defence Command said on its 
Twitter account.
The situation is under control and police have arrested a 51-year-old British man on suspicion of being behind the 
threat, the police said in a statement.
The aircraft will now be examined by the emergency squad and bomb group, the police said, adding all passengers 
were safely evacuated.
There were 142 passengers on board, plus an undisclosed number of crew members, a senior police official told 
Norwegian media.
"Crew on a Ryanair flight from London Stansted to Oslo today discovered a note that claimed there was a potential 
security threat on board," a Ryanair spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters.
"The captain followed procedures and continued to Oslo airport where the plane landed safely. Customers 
remained on board while authorities carried out a security search," she added. (Reuters)

Ryanair group's Lauda closes Stuttgart base as pilots reject wage cut
Ryanair group's Lauda closes Stuttgart base as pilots reject wage cut

Body
Budget carrier Lauda is giving up its German hub in Stuttgart and will terminate the contracts of all employees there 
after a majority of pilots opposed wage reductions, according to a company document obtained by dpa on 
Thursday.
The loss-making subsidiary of Irish-based Ryanair plans to close this base after the summer travel season on 
October 30.
While nearly all co-pilots and flight attendants in Stuttgart had agreed to a new collective labour contract that was 
drawn up in reaction to the pandemic-related aviation crisis, less than half of the captains gave their approval, the 
document said.
"Since there are no positions available elsewhere, we will not be able to offer any crew transfers" to other hubs, 
Lauda's Vienna-based management said in the paper that was initially made public by Austrian newspaper Der 
Standard.
A negotiator for the German labour union Verdi, Sven Bergelin, said Lauda would hopefully reconsider and would 
enter into talks to save jobs.
"Pilots and cabin crews want to be treated fairly and want to continue their work under acceptable standards," he 
said in a statement.
While Stuttgart is to be shuttered, a majority of pilots, co-pilots and flight attendants have accepted wage cuts in 
Lauda's other German base in Dusseldorf. Those who did not agree face possible lay-offs, according to Verdi.
Ryanair and Lauda's management had also threatened to lay off all staff in Vienna, but employees there agreed to 
a new wage deal in early June after Austrian unionists had managed to negotiate better conditions.

London Jupiter Fund Management gained on the back of a UBS upgrade to "buy".
Central bank intervention had resulted in three consecutive months of strong fund flows for money managers, said 
UBS.
"We think the aggressive monetary policies will drive further fund flows, particularly into higher margin equity funds 
in the coming quarters," it told clients. "With fixed income rates at their lowest levels in history around the globe, we 
expect this to drive higher allocations into riskier assets."
AstraZeneca jumped after ITV journalist Robert Peston reported that "positive news" should be expected on the 
drugmaker's experimental Covid-19 vaccine shortly.
The vaccine hopes meant travel and leisure stocks climbed, with Ryanair and catering group Compass among the 
top performers.
Burberry fell on unexpectedly gloomy guidance, with the fashion label predicting that a lack of tourists would hurt 
sales.
Pumpmaker Weir climbed after Société Générale turned positive.
A likely exit from the oil and gas business would turn Weir into a pure play on mining with up to a 50 per cent 
valuation upside, it said.

Ryanair today announced that it would cut Ireland-UK schedules for the months of August and September by up to 
1,000 flights, with the loss of over 200,000 passengers, as Ireland maintains a quarantine restriction on EU visitors 
even as the UK and Northern Ireland last week opened up air bridges to most EU countries.    Europe’s largest 
airline says Ireland (which accounts for less than 8% of Ryanair’s traffic), its tourism industry and connectivity for 
Irish workers commuting particularly to/from the UK is now suffering unrecoverable losses, as arriving EU 
passengers are forced to quarantine even while the border to Northern Ireland remains wide open with no such 
quarantines.    Speaking this week, a Spokesperson for Ryanair said, "This unique policy by Ireland, insisting on 
blanket quarantines with our European neighbours (most of whom have lower Covid case rates than Ireland) is 
damaging the recovery of Ireland’s economy and our tourism industry, causing long-term damage to jobs in 
Ireland’s largest employment sector, with business travellers in particular being told that Ireland is closed for 
business."
They added, "We call on the Irish Govt to remove all travel restrictions between Ireland and the EU (almost all of 
whom have lower Covid case rates than Ireland) as a matter of urgency, so that Ireland’s hotels, guest houses, 
restaurants and other tourism providers can recover their business and minimise job losses before we reach the 
downturn winter period. If MicheÁl Martin does not quarantine for 14 days after visiting Brussels this week, then why 
should any other Irish or EU citizen be treated differently."

Lufthansa-owned Air Dolomiti is adding two new destinations in Germany from late-July.
Italian airline Air Dolomiti is doubling the number of points served in Germany with the addition of Berlin and 
Dusseldorf to its network.
The carrier will begin flying from Verona (VRN) in northern Italy to Berlin Tegel (TXL) from July 30, followed by 
service to Dusseldorf (DUS) a day later. Flights will be 3X-weekly and 2X-weekly respectively, with the TXL service 
switching to Berlin Brandenburg (BER) from Oct. 8.
Both routes will be on board Embraer E195 aircraft.
Ryanair began serving VRN-Berlin Schoenefeld (SXF) in March 2017 but suspended the route in October 2018. 
Both routes on a city-pair basis have remained unserved since then.
The addition of Berlin and Dusseldorf means Air Dolomiti will fly to four destinations in Germany alongside Frankfurt 
(FRA) and Munich (MUC).
"The start of these two routes is meant to be an encouraging signal after the difficult phase of the departure due to 
the pandemic, also for all those activities that have suffered due to the lack of incoming tourism," Air Dolomiti 
president and CEO Joerg Eberhart said.
"It is a pleasure for us to be able to differentiate the offer by guaranteeing point-to-point flights as well as 
connections with the main Lufthansa hubs."
According to data provided by OAG Schedules Analyser, Air Dolomiti currently serves MUC from Florence (FLR), 
Turin (TRN) and VRN. FRA is served from Bari (BRI), Bologna (BLQ), FLR, Olbia (OLB), TRN and Venice (VCE).

London G4S was the FTSE 250's biggest gainer after the security services company said its half-year results would 
be "significantly above market consensus".
The update followed G4S saying late on Friday that it had accepted responsibility for making fraudulent claims 
about the profitability of a UK Ministry of Justice contract for electronic tagging of prisoners and had agreed to pay a 
£44m fine.
Ryanair climbed after a JPMorgan Cazenove upgrade to "overweight".
The airline "is clearly a long-term winner in European aviation with its fortress balance sheet and ultra-low costs," it 
said. "We believe it will use the current crisis to negotiate better terms from airports and, potentially, to place a 
major new order with Boeing at a very attractive price."
Fevertree Drinks rose after Barclays started coverage of the tonic water maker with "overweight" advice.
A rejig of US pricing and opportunities to broaden the range "give us confidence in strong double-digit sales growth 
over the coming years", Barclays said.
Legal & General edged higher after Bank of America turned positive on valuation grounds, noting the insurer's 8.6 
per cent dividend yield "is a particularly appealing proposition in a market starved of yield". Bryce Elder

London G4S was the FTSE 250's biggest gainer after the security services company said its half-year results would 
be "significantly above market consensus".
The update followed G4S saying late on Friday that it had accepted responsibility for making fraudulent claims 
about the profitability of a UK Ministry of Justice contract for electronic tagging of prisoners and had agreed to pay a 
£44m fine.
Ryanair climbed after a JPMorgan Cazenove upgrade to "overweight".
The airline "is clearly a long-term winner in European aviation with its fortress balance sheet and ultra-low costs," it 
said. "We believe it will use the current crisis to negotiate better terms from airports and, potentially, to place a 
major new order with Boeing at a very attractive price."
Fevertree Drinks rose after Barclays started coverage of the tonic water maker with "overweight" advice.
A rejig of US pricing and opportunities to broaden the range "give us confidence in strong double-digit sales growth 
over the coming years", Barclays said.
Legal & General edged higher after Bank of America turned positive on valuation grounds, noting the insurer's 8.6 
per cent dividend yield "is a particularly appealing proposition in a market starved of yield". Bryce Elder

Jul 14, 2020( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Description A Ryanair plane lands at 
Stansted Airport  Credits Dan Kitwood/Getty Images Alt Text ryanair  Two men arrested after note warning of 
explosives found in loo on Dublin-bound plane One-Minute Read[1] Joe Evans[2] Tuesday, July 14, 2020 - 1:32pm 
Two men have been arrested over a bomb scare that saw two RAF fighter jets scrambled to escort a Ryanair flight 
to Stansted Airport for an emergency landing. The security scare was triggered on Monday evening when crew on 
Flight FR1902 from the Polish city of Krakow to Dublin discovered a note in the plane's toilet claiming that 
explosives had been planted on board. The pilot 'immediately alerted UK authorities', who scrambled two Typhoon 
fighter jets from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, as well as a Quick Reaction Alert tanker from RAF Brize Norton in 
Oxfordshire, theDaily Mail[3]reports. 
Essex Police announced this morning that two men, aged 47 and 26, have been arrested on suspicion of making 
threats to endanger an aircraft, but that 'following investigations on the plane, we have been able to establish there 
[was] nothing suspicious on board'. According to the Crown Prosecution Service[4], the maximum penalty for 
endangering the safety of an aircraft by 'communicating false or misleading information' is life imprisonment or an 
unlimited fine. See related Will plane fares double after coronavirus crisis? [5] Airlines in crisis: coronavirus bites 
hard[6] Witnesses who saw yesterday's emergency landing said that the airport was 'covered with armed police', 
while theBoeing 737-800 plane was surrounded by 'lots and lots of fire engines and ambulances', theDaily 
Star[7]reports. Footage later emerged of armed police boarding the plane at around 7.35pm as it stood on the 
runway at Stansted, according to The Sun[8].'After five minutes on board, two officers appeared to escort a man in 
a white T-shirt from the aircraft,' says the newspaper, which adds that 'other passengers were then allowed to leave 
the plane'. A Ryanair spokesperson said that the plane's captain had 'followed procedure by alerting the UK 
authorities and diverted to the nearest airport'. Crime[9] Transport[10] Terrorism[11] Police[12] airlines[13] Air

Ryanair's Ireland-based cabin crew have accepted a temporary 10% pay cut as part of a package of measures 
designed to save jobs amid Covid-19's ongoing impact on travel, the union Fórsa reported on July 9. A similar deal 
involving wage reductions of 5% to 10% was struck with the carrier's British cabin crew on July 8, while last week 
Ryanair's pilots in the UK and Ireland accepted a temporary pay cut of 20% to shield jobs, unions said. The 
agreement Fórsa negotiated with Ryanair covers pay and other conditions for the LCC's 700 cabin crew, employed 
directly or via agencies. Members backed the deal in a ballot by a majority of 62% on a turnout of 68%, the union 
said. 
Fórsa official Ashley Connolly said the deal reflected the severity of the crisis aviation was facing. "Our cabin crew 
members understand the severity of this crisis. They've backed an agreement that protects their jobs and provides 
for a review of circumstances should they improve sooner than expected. Equally, it was important for us to have 
the restoration of pay built into the agreement," she said. Ryanair pledged to restore pay over four years and said 
that the deal's terms should avoid the need for redundancies, the Irish Times reported. The agreement also maps 
out rostering changes, part-time working, unpaid leave, and maximising Irish government Covid-19 wage support. 
Also, the deal scraps an annual bonus of up to EUR1,800 euros (USD2,040), which had been due to expire in 
March 2021, replacing it with basic salary increases of EUR900 (USD1,020) for the year from July 2023 and 
EUR900 from July 2024. Meanwhile, according to the British union Unite, Ryanair will keep all cabin crew in the UK 
in return for them accepting temporary pay reductions of 5% to 10%. Potential closures of the carrier's bases at 
Bournemouth, Glasgow Prestwick, Leeds/Bradford, and London Southend have also been averted, Unite said. The 
5%, 7.5%, and 10% pay cuts will be implemented depending on employees' earnings, with the lowest-paid seeing 
the smallest reductions. The cuts will be reversed in two tranches in 2023 and 2024, but Ryanair will scrap them 
earlier if it returns to pre-Covid-19 levels of business sooner.

More aeroplanes are flying in the skies above Europe as the air travel industry recovers from the coronavirus 
lockdown that almost brought it to its knees earlier in the year.
Over the course of the week ending on Sunday, the Eurocontrol organization for European aviation counted 90,549 
flights, up to 36.6 per cent of the levels seen during the same period last year.
Eurocontrol director general Eamonn Brennan spoke of "sustained traffic growth" in a tweet on Monday, noting that 
there was a rolling daily average of just under 13,000 flights.
That was 1,383 more than seen last week.
Irish budget airline Ryanair contributed significantly to the rise in traffic, offering on average 1,045 flights per day 
over the course of last week.

been agreed by Ryanair members of the Unite union following a vote."Unite has been contending with an incredibly 
difficult set of circumstances in the aviation sector," Diana Holland, the union's assistant general secretary said in a

follows a similar agreement announced between the Dublin-based no-frills Irish carrier and a separate union, Balpa, 
in which pilots agreed to a 20 percent pay cut to save jobs, although there could still be some redundancies among 
flying staff.And it comes after a Ryanair announcement in May that the airline was planning to cut 3,000 jobs 
because of the collapse of the aviation industry in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier this month, Ryanair 
said its passenger numbers for June had fallen by 97 percent. It carried 400,000 passengers in June 2020 
compared to 14.2 million in the same month 12 months earlier.The deal for Ryanair staff comes amid uncertainty for

Ryanair Holdings has said that it would appeal against an injunction issued by a Hungarian court which temporarily 
bans it from using its Buzz (RR, Warsaw Modlin) brand in the country pending the resolution of a lawsuit by Wizz 
Air (W6, Budapest). While the original ruling has not been reported and is not public, ch-aviation understands from 
sources in the Hungarian aviation industry that Wizz Air has sought to block its rival low-cost carrier from using the 
Buzz brand due to the alleged similarity to Wizz Air's own name. "We look forward to overturning this silly injunction 
on appeal, and we will continue to focus on Buzz's expansion in Hungary, as the lowest fare, industry-leading 
service winner across Central and Eastern Europe, even while Wizz are cutting aircraft and capacity in Budapest. 
Those that can, compete, and those that can't - like Wizz - run to Court seeking injunctions to protect them," 
Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a press release. 
Buzz, known until recently as Ryanair Sun (RR, Warsaw Modlin), is Ryanair's Polish subsidiary. The Irish LCC is 
using it to operate an increasing number of bases in Central and Eastern Europe, including at Budapest. The airline 
operates scheduled flights exclusively as a wet-lease operator under the code of Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l). 
However, it also operates charter flights on behalf of tour operators from Poland under its own code. Ryanair does 
not use the Buzz brand to market its scheduled flights in Hungary or elsewhere. Wizz Air did not respond to ch-
aviation's request for comment.

Jul 07, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, United 
Airlines UAL[1] grabbed headlines following its announcement that its schedule for August will be thrice its June 
capacity. This decision came in line with the recent uptick in air traffic in the United States despite a second-wave 
spurt in coronavirus cases. Notably, owing to this recovery in domestic travel demand, American Airlines AAL[2] 
lifted the booking cap on its flights from Jul 1, as mentioned in the previous week's write up[3].However, with 
international travel demand continuing to be soft on a year-over-year basis, American Airlines expects to reduce the 
long-haul international capacity by 25% during summer 2021. Meanwhile, the European low-cost carrier Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[4] too was in news as it offered an upbeat forecast for July air-travel demand. Per a Reuters 
report[5], the airline expects to carry more than 4.5 million passengers on its flights in the month. 
Even though the above reading marks a 70% decline from the actual number of passengers flown in last July, the 
same represents a marked improvement from the coronavirus-ravaged months of April and May.Recap of the Past 
Week's Most Important Stories1. United Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), plans to add nearly 
25,000 flights in August, triple the size of its June schedule, as air travel demand (especially leisure travel demand) 
improves steadily. With this, the carrier will fly about 40% of its August 2019 schedule.On the international front, 
United Airlines will fly about 25% of its August 2019 schedule.[6]You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[7]2. Ryanair reported a 97% year-over-year plunge in June traffic to merely 0.4 
million guests. As wide-spread travel restrictions are still in place, the carrier's LaudaMotion unit in Austria did not 
carry any passenger during the month. Nevertheless, in response to the recent rise in demand, the unit reopened 
on Jul 1.Ryanair operated 2800 scheduled flights in June with 95% arriving on time. On a rolling annual basis, total 
traffic at Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 27% to 107.2 million.[8]3. Apart from trimming 
international capacity for next summer, American Airlines plans to discontinue services to several leisure 
destinations that it expects will show reduced demand trends. Evidently, the airline will terminate three trans-Atlantic 
routes from Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport. Additionally, it will cease 
operations on five underperforming routes from Los Angeles International Airport to destinations in Asia and South 
America. In a bid to lend customers a flexible booking experience, the carrier extended its change fee waiver for 
new tickets to be booked through Jul 31, 2020[9].4. JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU[10] and its pilots union inked 
a deal to avoid involuntary furloughs until May 1, 2021 according to a CNBC report[11]. Although the details of the 
Airline Stock Roundup: UAL 's Bullish View for August Schedule, RYAAY in Focus
agreement remained undisclosed, the union agreed on not changing any pay rates.5. With the coronavirus 
pandemic affecting air-travel demand severely, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOL[12] did not operate regular 
international flights during June. Its total monthly traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), tanked 
88% on a year-over-year basis. With Gol Linhas lowering capacity in response to dwindling demand, total monthly 
capacity (measured in available seat miles) contracted 87.4%Moreover, consolidated load factor (% of seats filled 
by passengers) fell to 79.1% from 83% a year ago. Load factor declined as the fall in traffic was more than capacity 
contraction. Gol Linhas' total monthly departures slumped 86.9% and seats plummeted 87.9%.However, with air-
travel demand improving on the domestic front, domestic demand soared 95.4% from the level witnessed in May 
2020. Additionally, domestic supply in June surged 84.8% on a month-on-month basis.PerformanceThe following 
table shows the price movement of major airline players over the past week and during the past six months.The 
table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in the green in the past week as air traffic continues to 
display an uptrend despite the spike in COVID-19 cases across the United States. This upside led the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index to inch up 1.7% to $55.06. However, over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline 
Index has depreciated 17.3%.What's Next in the Airline Space?June traffic reports from the likes of Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT[13] will be awaited by investors in the coming days.Zacks' Single Best Pick to DoubleFrom 
thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each picked their favorite to gain +100% or more in months to come. From 
those 5, Zacks Director of Research, Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.This 
young company's gigantic growth was hidden by low-volume trading, then cut short by the coronavirus. But its 
digital products stand out in a region where the internet economy has tripled since 2015 and looks to triple again by 
2025. Its stock price is already starting to resume its upward arc. The sky's the limit! And the earlier you get in, the

Jul 07, 2020( evo: http://www.evo.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  When giving the backstory to taking his favourite 
image of a 550 Maranello[1] for our 'Life Through A Lens: The Italian Jobs' feature, Gus Gregory touches upon the 
magic of working in Italy. In talking to him for that quote I was reminded of what a huge part Italy has played in both 
our lives, and in the success of this magazine. For a golden period Gus and I would be in Italy at least once a 
month, sometimes to attend press launches (either as invitee or covert interlopers parked round the corner in a rival 
car), but often for drive stories I'd arranged.If we travelled by plane these trips would tend to follow the same 
routine: a horrendously early flight to Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport (which is actually on the outskirts of 
Bologna), or if we couldn't slip a couple of BA tickets by Harry Metcalfe's hawk-eyed scrutiny, a Ryanair flight to 
Bologna Forl, 60 miles from the city. To be honest, it didn't really matter. 
We were heading to Italy to shoot something fast and exotic, so life was good. Naturally enough, Ferrari often 
formed the basis of these missions, but we would also be regular visitors to Maserati[2], Lamborghini and Pagani[3]. 
Wherever we went we could expect a warm welcome, but we also knew the car probably wouldn't be ready, or 
there would be some confusion over our arrival date, or perhaps a paperwork issue. It would all come good in the 
end, but only after a bit of arm-flailing and a PR representative shouting 'Dai! Dai!' at somebody (or possibly 
nobody) down their mobile phone. I've never learned to speak Italian, but loitering in assorted supercar factory 
reception areas waiting for cars soon taught me that 'dieci minuti' actually means at least three quarters of an hour

on the shop price, and get evo for its original cover price for a whole year! > €5m Pagani Imola revealed with 
815bhp twin-turbocharged V12[4]My first visit to Lamborghini[5] predates evo, but only by a few years, when I went 
to drive the Diablo VT Roadster[6]. These were the pre-Audi[7] days and the factory was just as I imagined, with its 
distinctive 1960s architecture and quaint production lines that looked much like the black and white archive images 
I'd seen of Espadas[8] and Countaches[9] in the books and magazines I devoured as a kid. The car was epic, if 
somewhat unwieldy, but the best part by far was being shown around it by legendary test driver Valentino Balboni. 
Some years later I would spend the day with him in a Miura SV[10], hooning through the Apennine Mountains. Even 
as I type that statement it still seems like it must have been a dream.Those roads, in particular the Futa and 
Raticosa passes, became our playground. Countless times Gus and I would grab a car from Maranello or 
Sant'Agata and absolutely gun it for 70 miles down the A1 autostrada, knowing that although we were burning 
precious time getting there, we would be in a driver's and photographer's paradise once we arrived. Inevitably we 
would spend too long up in the hills and have to drive back at speeds more suited to Moss and Jenks in the '55 
'Driving a new Ferrari on those glorious roads was to feel like we had been given the keys to a kingdom'
Mille Miglia to make our flight home or get to the Ristorante Bounty in San Cesario sul Panaro before it closed to 
guzzle a cold Peroni and the world's thinnest pizza diavola.Gus describes those times as the days when we were 
kings. Not out of arrogance, but because to drive a brand new Lamborghini or Ferrari on those glorious, deserted 
roads was to feel like we had been given the keys to a kingdom. Our job was to bring back the best images and 
experiences so we might share them with you.Back then we were just as likely to drive out to Italy as we were to fly. 
I know we're all experiencing wanderlust right now, but just thinking about driving to Italy fills me with joy. All 
continental road trips have an occasion to them, but few hold more fond memories than the run down through 
France, up and over the St Gotthard Pass, before charging down towards the Italian Lakes and spearing across the 
fertile, crop-laden plains of Reggio Emilia to Supercar Valley.Of these glory days three trips stand out. The first was 
in a Jaguar XKR[11] (evo 014), three-up (myself, Gus and friend of evo John Hayman) with all Gus's camera gear 
and no room for spare clothes. We drove there on Friday afternoon, arrived at the Maserati factory at 6am 
Saturday, grabbed a couple of hours' sleep before taking a 3200GT [12]away to conduct a twin test, returned it to 
the factory late that afternoon and then drove straight back to the UK in one hit.The second is driving to Maranello 
in a Viper GTS[13]. Again on a Friday, again non-stop, this time accompanied by photographer Andy Morgan. For 
reasons best known to myself, I drove the whole way, experiencing fatigue-induced HunterS Thompson-style 
hallucinations along the way. It was worth it to join the rest of the evo team on 'The Devil's Playground' supercars 
test for issue 022.And the third? Driving to Tuscany and Umbria via Lake Como for my honeymoon. All of which 
goes to prove if you have a drop of petrol in your veins then it figures you also have Italy in your 
heart.Advertisement - Article continues below [ 1]: https://www.evo.co.uk/ferrari/california/13351/a-z-supercars-

A Ryanair flight en route from Berlin to Athens had to make an unscheduled stop in Thessaloniki after a false fire 
alarm on Friday.
All passengers were well, according to Greek state radio ERT.
The pilot of the flight announced an emergency landing after a fire alarm went off in the cockpit while the aircraft 
was flying over the Greek port city of Thessaloniki.
An alarm was signalled at Thessaloniki airport and the plane landed without problems, the local news portal in the 
city reported.
The Irish airline Ryanair resumed around 40 per cent of its flights on July 1 after operating on a skeleton schedule 
since mid-March, due to the drop in demand and restrictions imposed from the coronavirus pandemic.

Jul 03, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Travellers from 
more than 70 "low-risk" countries and territories will no longer have to self-isolate when arriving in England, the UK 
government said Friday in a major easing of its coronavirus quarantine scheme.The list of exemptions mostly 
covers Europe -- but not Portugal -- and the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand, although the United States and 
mainland China are notably omitted.The changes, which come into effect on July 10, represent a significant lifting of 
the mandatory 14-day self-quarantine imposed one month ago to stop new infections from abroad.Britain has 
suffered Europe's deadliest outbreak of COVID-19, with 44,000 deaths among confirmed cases, but is now slowly 
coming out of lockdown."Today marks the next step in carefully reopening our great nation," Transport Secretary 
Grant Shapps said.Airlines, who had warned the quarantine would cripple an industry already on its knees due to 
global coronavirus shutdowns, welcomed the easing and three of them dropped a legal challenge.But the 
exemptions will only apply to arrivals into England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland so far sticking to the 
blanket ban. UK ministers had suggested the delay in announcing the list -- it had been due earlier in the week -- 
was down to a lack of cooperation from the devolved government in Scotland.But Scottish First Minister Nicola 
Sturgeon denied this, and blasted Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in London for a "shambolic" 
effort.She said the list her government was shown on Thursday had changed by Friday, while adding that 
Edinburgh would likely publish its own list in the coming days. 
The two-week quarantine period was imposed in June Photo: AFP / JUSTIN TALLIS Under the new rules, a traffic-
light system -- red, amber and green -- would be used for different countries depending on their prevalence of the 
coronavirus, Shapps said.Travellers from the green and amber countries will no longer have to self-isolate on 
arrival.The amber countries will have reciprocal arrangements in place with England, while the green countries are 
deemed to be safer than England, such as New Zealand.The amber countries include France, Italy and Spain, 
which are among the most popular summer holiday destinations for Britons, although not Portugal.The United 
States will be designated with a red light, requiring mandatory self-quarantine, because "they have got very high 
numbers of infections", Shapps said.British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair had taken legal action over the scheme 
they said would have a "severe impact on the travel and tourism industry", which was "already running on 
fumes".But their lawyer told the High Court of England and Wales in London on Friday that they had now agreed to 
withdraw the claim.In a statement, budget airline easyJet said the list of exemptions was "an important move in the 
reopening of aviation, to support the wider UK recovery".Patricia Yates, director of tourism body VisitBritain, said 
allowing easier entry for overseas visitors would provide "a timely boost".

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has said that flights from Cardiff Airport to Faro, Portugal and Malaga, Spain will go ahead 
as planned on July 3, despite a request by the Welsh Government, which owns the airport, to wait until the end of 
Wales' "stay local" travel guidance on July 6. The airline argued that "hundreds of Welsh people" would be returning 
from countries with "R" rates of coronavirus transmission that are lower than the UK's, the BBC reported. Welsh 
Economy Minister Ken Skates told the broadcaster: "Everybody needs to continue to contribute to the national effort 
and it is for individuals to take responsibility now. We know that a huge proportion of the tickets for these flights 
were sold up to 12 months ago. 
We don't know how many passengers will actually turn up at the airport." Wales has asked residents to stay local, 
using the limit of five miles (eight kilometres) as a guideline. These restrictions are expected to be lifted on July 6, 
after which people can "travel as far as they like for all purposes." Cardiff Airport has remained open throughout the 
pandemic to support essential operations including critical cargo and medical flights. "During July our airlines will 
slowly restart passenger services, increasing in August. All airlines are making decisions about reinstating flights on 
a global basis and the situation remains fluid," an airport spokesperson told the BBC. The airport has scheduled the 
Ryanair flights to Faro, Malaga, and Barcelona El Prat as the first phase of a planned resumption of commercial 
flights. During July, Vueling Airlines and Eastern Airways will implement a gradual return to Cardiff, TUI Airways and 
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines plan a return in August, and Qatar Airways is looking at returning in October, the UK's 
BusinessLive news site reported.

Jul 03, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Travellers 
from more than 70 "low-risk" countries and territories will no longer have to self-isolate when arriving in England, the 
UK government said Friday in a major easing of its coronavirus quarantine scheme. The list of exemptions mostly 
covers Europe -- but not Portugal -- and the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand, although the United States and 
mainland China are notably omitted. 
The changes, which come into effect on July 10, represent a significant lifting of the mandatory 14-day self-
quarantine imposed one month ago to stop new infections from abroad. Britain has suffered Europe's deadliest 
outbreak of COVID-19, with 44,000 deaths among confirmed cases, but is now slowly coming out of lockdown. 
"Today marks the next step in carefully reopening our great nation," Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. 
Airlines, who had warned the quarantine would cripple an industry already on its knees due to global coronavirus 
shutdowns, welcomed the easing and three of them dropped a legal challenge. But the exemptions will only apply 
to arrivals into England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland so far sticking to the blanket ban. UK ministers 
had suggested the delay in announcing the list -- it had been due earlier in the week -- was down to a lack of 
cooperation from the devolved government in Scotland. But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denied this, and 
blasted Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government in London for a "shambolic" effort. She said the list her 
government was shown on Thursday had changed by Friday, while adding that Edinburgh would likely publish its 
own list in the coming days. Under the new rules, a traffic-light system -- red, amber and green -- would be used for 
different countries depending on their prevalence of the coronavirus, Shapps said. Travellers from the green and 
amber countries will no longer have to self-isolate on arrival. The amber countries will have reciprocal arrangements 
in place with England, while the green countries are deemed to be safer than England, such as New Zealand. The 
amber countries include France, Italy and Spain, which are among the most popular summer holiday destinations 
for Britons, although not Portugal. The United States will be designated with a red light, requiring mandatory self-
quarantine, because "they have got very high numbers of infections", Shapps said. British Airways, easyJet and

       U.K. stocks fell notably on Friday even as the latest data indicated that the worst phase of the service sector 
downturn has passed.
 The U.K. Service sector Purchasing Managers' Index for June rose to 47.1 from 29.0 in May. The latest reading 
was better than the "flash" estimate of 47.0.
 Separately, a flash survey conducted by the market research group GfK revealed that U.K. consumer sentiment 
improved at the end of June. The corresponding index rose three points to -27 over the last two weeks of June.
 Virus worries persist after the U.S. notched more than 53,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours Thursday, marking 
a record single-jump in infections around the country.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 dropped 47 points, or 0.75 percent, to 6,193 after rising 1.3 percent on Thursday. 
 Ryanair Holdings shed 0.7 percent. The budget airline welcomed acceptance by 100 percent of its Irish Pilots of a 
4-year agreement which includes a 20 percent pay reduction, restored over 4 years, to minimize job losses. 
 Retailer Next lost 2.5 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the stock to "sell".
 Rio Tinto declined 1.3 percent. The mining giant said Oyu Tolgoi LLC has completed an updated feasibility study 
(OTFS20) and is in the process of submitting this to the Government of Mongolia. 
 Essentra, a supplier of plastic and fiber products, jumped 6 percent. The company reported that its like-for-like 
revenue trend improved as the second quarter progressed. For the third quarter, the company projected continued 
revenue progress on a stable operating base.
FTSE 100 Declines Despite Positive Data
 Real estate investment trust Land Securities Group advanced 1.7 percent. The company said that 122 million 
pounds of rent was due on the 24 June rent payment date.

Highlight: Younger generations have different traveller preferences in comparison to older generations. Younger 
travellers prefer to embark upon smaller, shorter holidays to destinations that are not too far away, but go away 
more times in the year. City breaks amongst millennials are popular. A recent GlobalData survey found that 41% of 
millennials (25-34) globally go on city breaks, compared to 31% of silent generation (65+) respondents. Older 
generations prefer to go on holiday less frequently, but for longer and to more exotic, long-haul destinations.
Body
Younger travellers also typically have lower levels of disposable income, due to time spent studying rather than 
working full time, or because they are in the early stages of establishing a career. This leaves less income to be 
spent on holidays and activities, in a time where the desire to go on multiple holidays per year is high. The Covid-19 
pandemic will have imposed even further restrictions on travellers' budgets, many would be travellers have been left 
without work or less work due to global economic decline. 
Many people have been forced to cancel travel plans due to Covid-19. Travellers will be looking to rebook their 
holidays now due to the opening up of borders in regions such as Europe and encouragement of booking from 
tourist destinations. With reduced budgets in mind, travellers who are itching to go on holiday again after months of 
lockdown measures being in place will look primarily for low cost options due to risk of cancellation. If cancelled, 
their money could be tied up with a travel company for a considerable amount of time before it is refunded Low cost 
companies have targeted the right audience amid Covid-19Marketing by travel companies during the pandemic has 
been more important than ever. To keep customers engaged and aware during the global shutdown has been and 
remains to be important for any future success. Low cost operators such as easyJet and Hostelworld have utilised 
their social media platforms during lockdown, by posting snippets of travel inspiration including virtual travel 
experiences and by keeping customers up to date with their booking schedules. As social media is a cheap but 
effective method of marketing, it is very important for low cost companies to utilise this. It attracts the right audience, 
which is often younger generations, and fits in with the low cost business model. By using social media, low cost 
travel companies are able to be more informal with their approach and relate to the customer more in their 
marketing campaigns. Alongside this, low cost airlines have been highly reactive to changes in rules allowing 
Low cost travel companies will benefit from high levels of demand from young consumers
tourists to visit popular, international destinations once again. Ryanair launched one of its infamous seat sales when 
Spain announced it would allow European tourists to visit from July 1. Its relatable headline 'Spain's open again' 
attracted attention from restless travellers and created a surge in bookings. Despite a willingness to travel, not all 
travellers will be willing to take off againThe recovery of the travel industry will not be unified post-Covid-19. 
Individual opinions around safety and hygiene will impact whether travellers want to travel internationally again. Just 
because destinations have opened again and it may be cheap to get there, does not mean that tourism demand will 
rebound to pre-Covid-19 levels straight away. Domestic holidays have seen a rise in bookings, where UK based 
holiday bookings from the domestic market have quadrupled after announcements were made that the hospitality 
sector could reopen from 4th July. Domestic holidays will be in high demand as it could be seen as a safer option. 
Domestic holidays can almost always be reached via travellers own personal vehicle, and limits the contact with 
others that could put them at risk.

The Irish budget airline said the pilots also agreed to productivity improvements on rosters, flexible working patterns 
and annual leave. 
The British Airline Pilots' Association and Ryanair's UK pilots accepted 20% pay cuts earlier this week.

Jul 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[1] posted bland traffic numbers for June, primarily due to weak air travel demand stemming from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. This Irish carrier reported a 97% year-over-year plunge in June traffic to merely 0.4 million 
guests. As wide-spread travel restrictions are still in place, the carrier's LaudaMotion unit in Austria did not carry 
any passenger during the month. 
Nevertheless, in response to recent rise in demand, this Austria-based unit has reopened from Jul 1.Ryanair 
operated 2800 scheduled flights in June with 95% of them arriving on time. On a rolling annual basis, total traffic at 
Ryanair (including the LaudaMotion unit) declined 27% to 107.2 million. Load factor (% of seats filled with 
passengers) was 95% on a rolling annual basis.Owing to certain travel relaxations and air travel demand gradually 
increasing, this European low-cost carrier expects to carry more than 4.5 million passengers on its flights in July, 
per Reuters report[2]. Thereby, we expect its July traffic numbers to sharply rise from May and June readings.In 
response to the recent rise in demand, American Airlines AAL[3] has started to book its flights to full capacity from 
Jul 1 and Delta Air Lines DAL[4] expects to expand capacity by about 1,000 flights in both July and August. Both 
American Airlines and Delta carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Zacks Rank &#38; A Key PickRyanair currently carries a

Ryanair prices set to be "lower than ever" for a year
Ryanair prices set to be "lower than ever" for a year

Ryanair reported "very strong" bookings from holidaymakers as it relaunched its network with 1,000 flights on 
Wednesday, the start of a summer that Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary hopes will restore Europe's 
confidence in air travel.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier has been flying a skeleton service since the COVID-19 pandemic closed down 
much of Europe in March. It was set to fly 105,000 passengers on Wednesday, almost as many as it flew in April 
and May combined.
O'Leary, one of the loudest advocates for a reopening of European air travel from COVID-19 restrictions, said he 
was hopeful the airline could go from 4.5 million passengers in July to as many as 6 million in August, around half 
its normal level.
"It's a good start," O'Leary told Reuters in an interview after the first 150 flights took off on time with all passengers 
wearing face masks.
"If we have a strong July and August with lots of families traveling on holidays ... and recognizing they can do it 
safely, I think we will see ... a much more stable return to normal volumes from September onwards," he said.
Critics say a return to widespread tourism in Europe could reverse major progress in tackling COVID-19.
Ireland's outgoing health minister said on Wednesday he found himself "shouting at the radio" when another 
Ryanair executive said it was safe to travel despite the government advising against it.
Ryanair prices set to be "lower than ever" for a year
O'Leary said he was confident Britain would this week announce an opening of travel with the European Union, 
ahead of a court case on Friday taken by Ryanair and rivals against the UK government's 14-day quarantine.
"There is no scientific basis for it and we expect to get it overturned," he said, adding Ireland's chief medical officer 
was being "over-cautious" in advising against travel.
O'Leary said bookings for the first couple of weeks of flights in July were "very strong" with August "reasonably 
strong." September and October are a bit weaker at the moment, he added, as people wait to see how the situation 
develops.
Ticket prices have been weak for the summer and are likely to remain so.
"Certainly, for the next 12 months you are going to see lower-than-ever airfares, certainly on Ryanair," O'Leary said.
While passenger numbers are likely to return to 2019 levels next year, it will probably take until 2022 or 2023 before 
ticket prices return to pre-pandemic levels, he predicted.
Ryanair has said it may cut up to 3,000 jobs among pilots and cabin crew, but O'Leary said he was "reasonably 
hopeful but not confident" it could agree pay cuts and changes to work practices to avoid most of them.
Some unions in continental Europe are "are sticking their heads in the sand," he said. (Reuters)

Lockdown easing pits Irish health officials against airline bosses

Ryanair used its return to a more regular schedule on Wednesday to pile pressure on its home market of Ireland to 
ease travel restrictions in a debate that has pitted airline bosses against increasingly cautious health officials.
Ireland's then caretaker government said last week it planned to lift a 14-day quarantine for anyone traveling to and 
from countries that have also suppressed the coronavirus from July 9 and would publish a list of safe countries.
However, new prime minister MicheÁl Martin, appointed last weekend, said on Monday he would take a cautious 
approach to opening up air travel after health authorities warned this could reignite the coronavirus crisis in Ireland.
"We can't say we're somehow different, close the doors and throw away the keys. On that basis we may as well 
move out to the Aran Islands," Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair's main airline unit, told the Newstalk radio 
station, referring to the tiny Irish islands off its west coast.
"We'll have zero cases of COVID maybe momentarily, we'll have zero jobs and we'll have zero tourists ... The one 
country that's sitting out in the northwest of the Atlantic that needs air travel most is saying that we're actually 
closed."
In an interview with Reuters, Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ireland's chief medical officer, 
Tony Holohan, was being over-cautious and should stick to health, not travel advice.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget carrier, ramped up its flights from Dublin on Wednesday as it returned to a more 
regular schedule, even as the Irish government's advice remained that citizens should not travel abroad for non-
essential reasons.
Lockdown easing pits Irish health officials against airline bosses
Cillian De Gascun, the country's top virologist, said on Wednesday the importation of cases from abroad was now 
the biggest risk to Ireland's low level of infections, while one of Martin's ministers was highly critical of Wilson's 
intervention.
"Haven't found myself shouting at the radio in quite a while but that interview on air travel and COVID-19 changed 
all that," Higher Education Minister Simon Harris, who until last week was health minister and the public face of the 
crisis, tweeted.
"As a citizen, I'll keep taking my public health advice from our Chief Medical Officer and would recommend you do 
likewise." (Reuters)

       European stocks were rallying on Thursday as encouraging news on a vaccine for Covid-19 as well as upbeat 
manufacturing PMI data across the globe helped revive hopes for a quick economic recovery.
 Investors also looked ahead to the U.S. Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report for June 
due later in the day for further clues about the health of the world's largest economy.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 climbed 1.3 percent to 365.69 after closing up 0.2 percent on Wednesday.
 The German DAX rose about 2 percent, France's CAC 40 index gained 1.7 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was 
up 0.8 percent.
 Travel stocks gained ground in London after reports that dozens of countries will be exempt from a travel 
quarantine from Monday.
 British Airways-owner IAG surged 6.3 percent, while hotel group rallied 3.4 percent and Intercontinental Hotel 
Group added 3.3 percent.
 Primark-owner Associated British Foods jumped 5.4 percent. The company said that trading in its stores that have 
reopened after coronavirus lockdown has been "reassuring and encouraging".
 Low-cost airline Wizz Air Holdings rose over 2 percent and Ryanair Holdings gained 3.3 percent after unveiling 
their passenger traffic figures for June.
 Meggitt soared 7 percent. The engineering company said that it is experiencing initial signs of recovery in 
commercial aerospace.
European Shares Rally On Economic Optimism
 Swiss drug maker Novartis AG shed 0.6 percent after it agreed to pay $678 million to resolve a whistle-blower case 
in the U.S. 
 Fashion house Hugo Boss rallied 3 percent after it appointed Tommy Hilfiger executive Oliver Timm as its chief 
sales officer.
 Scandal-hit Wirecard plunged 26 percent. Police and prosecutors have raided the headquarters of the beleaguered 
payments firm as part of a fraud investigation relating to its £1.7bn accounting black hole.
 French electric utility Engie rallied nearly 4 percent. The company has agreed to sell 49 percent equity interest in a 
2.3 GW US renewables portfolio to Hannon Armstrong. Engie will retain a controlling share in the portfolio and 
continue to manage the assets.
 On the data front, the euro area unemployment rate rose marginally in May, figures from Eurostat showed.

Highlight: London Southend Airport in the UK has reopened its terminal to passengers after it was closed for three 
months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Body
The terminal will be following new measures to safeguard the health of passengers and employees in the airport. 
Stobart Aviation CEO Glyn Jones said: "We have worked extremely hard to ensure measures are in place to create 
a biosphere within the terminal, delivering confidence to our customers. 
"As London's most modern airport, the terminal design and space supports social distancing and allows 
approximately 17 square metres per passenger during busy times." During the suspension of passenger flights, the 
airport continued to operate cargo and repatriation flights. Passenger services will restart during this month with 
flights from airline partners such as Ryanair, Wizz Air and Flyone. In addition, a new route to Norway will 
commence next month with Wideroe. The airport has introduced different safety measures and mandated the use 
of face coverings. It also stated that only those who are travelling will be permitted inside the terminal. It has also 
implemented enhanced cleaning and installed bio-screens at all face-to-face locations. The airport has set up hand 
sanitisation stations at every 20 paces of its terminal and has installed temperature cameras and a new security 
scanner. Glyn said: "We are reducing touch points throughout the journey to limit potential spread of the virus, deep 
cleaning will take place nightly whilst the cleaning team will be sanitising handrails and surfaces throughout the day. 
"We are committed to safety and continue discussions for further investments into innovations for the airport." 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has identified London Southend Airport as a low risk airport, 
making it the only London airport with such a certification.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-pilots-agree-to-20-pay-cut-in-attempt-to-limit-job-losses/Ryanair pilots 
have agreed to take a 20% pay cut as part of efforts to avoid up to 3,000 job cuts at Europe's biggest budget 
airline.The pilots' union Balpa announced on Wednesday that 96% of its Ryanair members had voted to accept the 
temporary pay cut in order to 'save jobs that were under threat' due to the collapse in demand for flights in the face 
of the coronavirus pandemic. 'This is a terrible time for aviation and for employees in all airlines,' Brian Strutton, 
Balpa's general secretary said. 
'It was our members' mandate for us to save as many jobs as possible[1]. In the circumstances this is the right thing 
to do even if it means accepting difficult temporary reductions in pay.' The pilots agreed to the pay cut deal hours 
after Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, made public an ultimatum that a total of 3,000 job losses could 
only be avoided if all staff agreed to pay cuts. The deal with Ryanair's pilots saves 260 jobs that were at risk. 
Ryanair had said a total of 330 pilot jobs were at risk. Negotiations with cabin crew and other staff continue, lower 
paid cabin crew have been asked to sacrifice 5% of their pay. Earlier on Wednesday, O'Leary had said: 'We've 
already announced about 3,000 job losses but we're engaged in extensive negotiations with our pilots, our cabin 
crew and we're asking them to all take pay cuts as an alternative to job losses. 'We're looking from 20% from the 
best-paid captains, 5% from the lowest-paid flight attendants and we think if we can negotiate those pay cuts by 
agreement, we can avoid most but not all job losses.' 'Pilots have agreed to accept a 20% pay reduction in order to 
save 260 of the jobs that were at risk, with most of the rest linked to the possible base closures which is still to be 
resolved. We will remain in negotiations with the airline about those jobs and aim to protect those too.' The union 
said Ryanair had agreed that pay will be restored to 100% over the next four years. Strutton added: 'We do not 
relish accepting pay cuts and this is going to be tough for many of our pilot members. But we are at least pleased to 
have ensured that the overwhelming number of pilots whose jobs were at risk will continue to be employed.' 
O'Leary, who is chief executive of Ryanair's holding company, initially took a 50% cut to his pay in April and May, 
and has extended this for this financial year until the end of March 2021. On Wednesday, Ryanair began a 'big 
ramp-up' of its schedule to 1,000 fights a day. Eddie Wilson, who is chief executive of the group's main airline, said: 
'At Ryanair we are doing everything we can to return to flying, so we can reunite friends and family, allow people to 
return to work and begin to restart Europe's tourism industry, upon which millions of jobs, especially for young 
people, now depend.' Ryanair has refused a Welsh government request to postpone flights scheduled to arrive in 
Ryanair pilots agree to 20% pay cut in attempt to limit job losses
Cardiff starting on Friday, due to concerns that passengers could bring the coronavirus with them into Wales. A 
flight from Mlaga is due to land at the airport on Friday morning, and another from Faro, Portugal, on Friday 
evening. A Ryanair spokesman said: 'We are operating normally on 3 and 4 July with hundreds of Welsh people 
travelling home from countries with lower 'R rates' than the UK.' A Welsh government spokesperson said: 'We don't 
believe these flights should be going ahead.' People in Wales have been asked to stay local, within five miles, as 
guidance. On Tuesday, easyJet said it planned to make as many as one in three of its pilots redundant. The airline 
plans to cut up to 727 pilot jobs and up to 1,200 cabin crew posts across the UK. EasyJet started consultations with 
unions in the UK on Tuesday after announcing last month that it would be making about 4,500 staff redundant 
across Europe. It also plans to close its bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle airports. On Wednesday, 
easyJet said it planned to reduce the number of aircraft and employees based in Berlin and had launched a 
consultation with unions. 'Although we will remain Berlin's largest carrier, we have to adjust our schedule to reflect 
the demand following the pandemic and focus on profitable flying,' the chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said. Read

Ryanair, one of the largest customers for Boeing's troubled 737 MAX, hopes to take its first delivery in November 
after the jet's first test flight appeared to go well, Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Wednesday.
Boeing this week began a series of long-delayed flight tests of its redesigned 737 MAX with regulators at the 
controls after the second of two fatal crashes grounded the jet worldwide in early 2019.
"The first test flight was on Tuesday, that seems to have gone well and if that keeps on track then at least we hope 
to be welcoming our first 30-40 for summer 2021 and that would enable us to restart growth," O'Leary told Reuters.
Ryanair (RYA.I), Europe's largest low-cost airline, has 210 737 MAX jets on order and is in talks with Boeing over 
compensation for delays to deliveries, which were due to start last year.
"Subject to the MAX being certified to return to service in North America, we would hope to be getting our first 
deliveries in November. This side of Christmas," O'Leary said.
Compensation talks, which are focusing on repricing the planes, would not be concluded until Boeing confirms a 
new delivery schedule, he said.

Flight activity increased in June as airlines added to their schedules, but non-commercial flights continued to lead 
overall growth. In June, Flightradar24 tracked 3,555,769 total flights, down 42% from June 2019. Commercial 
flights, at 1,373,303 in June, were down 62% from June 2019.
Total flights down 42% in June, compared to 2019
The total number of flights tracked in June 2020 was down 42% from June 2019. Total traffic in May 2020 was 52% 
below 2019 levels. As in previous months, the increase in total flights is due mostly to non-commercial flight activity. 
Through the first six months of 2020, total flights are down 29% compared to 2019.
Commercial flights down 62% in June, compared to 2019
Commercial flight growth continues to lag total flights, ending June 62% below 2019 levels. However, commercial 
flights in June climbed 32% above May. Through June, 2020 commercial flights are 40% below 2019 levels.
Airlines again revised their schedules on 1 July to increase flight activity, including the largest European low cost 
carriers like Ryanair and easyJet, so we expect to see an increase in commercial activity in July statistics. However, 
flight activity could be hampered by renewed regional lock downs, as was the case in Beijing in June.

Swissport Belgium's bankruptcy hinders Brussels restart
Swissport Belgium's bankruptcy hinders Brussels restart

The resumption of scheduled traffic at Brussels National airport, which has been gradually progressing since June 
15, has been hampered by the bankruptcy of ground handler Swissport Belgium. Swissport International, which is 
owned by HNA Group, said its Belgian unit had filed for bankruptcy in early June after "many years of loss-making 
operations" and "numerous local efforts to turn around the business [which] failed". The ground handler underlined 
that its Belgian units were reliant on liquidity injections and that while "some progress" had been made in their 
restructuring, "the global market collapse in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis has blocked the narrow path to 
recovery". "We had to acknowledge that there were no viable options left on the table and no positive prospects on 
the horizon," Swissport Group President and Chief Executive Eric Born said. The bankruptcy has affected 
Swissport's ground handling and cleaning units, but not its cargo operations at Brussels National or Liège. 
The ground handler's bankruptcy, just days before the planned restart of scheduled operations at Brussels National, 
presented a new challenge to airlines. Swissport was the handler for, among others, Brussels Airlines (SN, Brussels 
National), which currently has a 29.1% market share by capacity at the airport, according to the ch-aviation 
capacities module. The second- and third-largest airlines at Brussels airport, TUI fly (Belgium) (TB, Brussels 
National) and Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), have contracts with rival handler Aviapartner. Due to the limited number of 
flights operated at this time, most airlines have managed to adjust to their ground handler's malaise. However, 
Alitalia (AZ, Rome Fiumicino) has since decided to extend its suspension of services to Brussels due to the collapse 
of Swissport and presently serves the Belgian capital using bus connections from its flights to Amsterdam Schiphol.

LCC to fly 90% of pre-pandemic network.
Ryanair said it would operate over 1,000 daily flights across Europe from July 1, about 40% of its normal July 
capacity, as it returned to flying following the COVID-19 crisis.
The Dublin-based LCC said it would operate flights to and from 200 European airports, restoring almost 90% of its 
pre-pandemic route network, albeit with lower frequencies.
Air traffic is gradually ramping up again across Europe after coming to an almost complete standstill in March when 
travel restrictions were imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Eurocontrol said over 9,200 flights were 
operated June 29, which is still 75% lower than the same day in 2019. It is expecting to traffic to reach almost 50% 
of 2019 levels by early August.
Ryanair Group CEO Michael O'Leary said: "We have been back flying approximately 250 flights daily for the last 10

O'Leary welcomed a UK government plan, expected to be detailed in the coming days, to replace a controversial 
14-day quarantine measure for travelers from abroad arriving in the country with "air bridges" to many European 
countries and called on the Irish government to scrap its own quarantine measure, which O'Leary said was a threat 
to Ireland's own tourism industry.

LCC to fly 90% of pre-pandemic network.
Ryanair said it would operate over 1,000 daily flights across Europe from July 1, about 40% of its normal July 
capacity, as it returned to flying following the COVID-19 crisis.
The Dublin-based LCC said it would operate flights to and from 200 European airports, restoring almost 90% of its 
pre-pandemic route network, albeit with lower frequencies.
Air traffic is gradually ramping up again across Europe after coming to an almost complete standstill in March when 
travel restrictions were imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Eurocontrol said over 9,200 flights were 
operated June 29, which is still 75% lower than the same day in 2019. It is expecting to traffic to reach almost 50% 
of 2019 levels by early August.
Ryanair Group CEO Michael O'Leary said: "We have been back flying approximately 250 flights daily for the last 10 
days of June to bring our aircraft, our crews and our maintenance teams back into service. We expect in July to 
carry more than 4.5 million customers."

Southwest eyes notes after CEO's 'intensive care' warning
Southwest eyes notes after CEO's 'intensive care' warning
AirFinance Journal

Days after revealing the carrier is in "intensive care", Southwest Airlines is in the market looking to secure funding 
from a proposed unsecured note offering to repay its $500 million notes deal at 2.65% due later this year.
The notes have been rated Fitch 'BBB+' by Fitch. Additional proceeds, if any, will be used to bolster liquidity.
"Our company is in intensive care. We're losing roughly $20 million a day, and this massive and unprecedented 
amount of fresh cash is crucial to fund these losses. Without it, we run out of cash, and literally, shut down," Gary 
Kelly, the airline's chairman and chief executive officer, told employees in a letter on the airline's website on 24 July.
Southwest ended the second quarter with $15.5 billion in total liquidity including $1 billion available under its 
revolving line of credit
"Today, we have $14 billion in the bank, enough to fund losses for more than two years and short-term investments 
plus another $1 billion bank line of credit that we have ready access to. That's very good, but remember we now 
have record levels of debt; more than $11 billion. We owe that in addition to having to fund daily operating losses of 
$20 million, or roughly $1 billion every two months," said Kelly.
"Even with the disaster at hand, we still have an investment-grade rating, which means we can continue to access 
the capital markets. Plus, we have $12 billion in assets we own free and clear that are available as collateral in the 
future if needed."
Kelly says the Dallas-based airline had 400 aircraft idled and out of service in the spring, but that total has been 
reduced to 100 units. Second-quarter trips were down 56% versus a year ago, he adds.
Fitch views Southwest's liquidity as ample to manage through the coronavirus pandemic, even in scenarios where 
demand remains subdued for a prolonged period. The airline remains in a net cash position at the end of the 
second quarter and Fitch expects that the company may remain in a net cash position at year-end even as it 
continues to burn cash in the near term.
Fitch downgraded Southwest to 'BBB+' from 'A-' on 10 April. Fitch views Southwest as the best positioned US 
carrier to manage through the pandemic given its strong balance sheet, unencumbered asset base and domestic 
focus.
Southwest eyes notes after CEO's 'intensive care' warning
Southwest is rated one notch above Ryanair (BBB/Negative), which is its closest rated peer. Southwest compares 
well with Ryanair because of its lower level of gross leverage, a longer track record of profitability and a larger base 
of unencumbered assets.

Big three European LCCs face â,¬1bn hit in Q2

Easyjet, Ryanair and Wizz Air will post a combined swing of (EURO)1 billion ($1.1 billion) from profit to loss for the 
second quarter, but there are signs that the latter two will deliver "small profits" in the following quarter, analysts at 
Goodbody believe.
The three big European low-cost carriers are likely to report "big" losses in their second-quarter results, which are 
due to be published in the coming days, as they capture the "tumultuous" impact of traffic falling 95% from last year.
The (EURO)1 billion figure looks "modest" compared with the multi-billion losses suffered by European network 
carriers, analysts Mark Simpson and Nuala McMahon suggest.
Ryanair is expected to incur a loss after tax of (EURO)232 million for its Q1, FY2021, with the number at the lower 
end of guidance due to an estimated (EURO)70 million of deferred income from no-shows for flights that departed 
in March.
However, Goodbody expects commentary to be "more positive" in terms of the current quarter, which runs to the 
end of September, and predicts a "small profit" of some (EURO)130 million, helped by Ryanair's move to deliver 
60% of its network over this peak summer quarter.
Wizz Air is expected to incur a loss of (EURO)131 million for its Q1 2021 results, "in-line with consensus". As with 
Ryanair, Goodbody was encouraged by Wizz's write-down of ineffective hedges. A better result is expected for its 
fiscal second quarter.
The analysts note Wizz is ramping up capacity, which could reach 75% of pre-Covid-19 levels using July traffic data 
as a guide.
Goodbody is less upbeat about Easyjet, noting that the airline has "failed to date to have sold its vision to investors 
in terms of being a smaller fleet operator following its H120 release on 24 June and the rights issue on that same 
day".
They note that the stock issue raised £419 million (£525 million), but since then the stock has lost 16% of its value 
and is underperforming those of Ryanair and Wizz.
Big three European LCCs face â,¬1bn hit in Q2
Simpson and McMahon predict the UK budget carrier will incur a loss of pre-tax loss of approximately £153 million 
in its third quarter from a profit of £173 million in the same period a year before. They say the airline's fortress base 
strategy is at risk in times of traffic decline.
While LCCs may be recovering, Goodbody warns of some caution on the risk to pricing as the sector continues to 
add capacity into the winter season , and given some rising reluctance to travel as the Covid-19 crisis continues.
"With the situation extremely fluid, sentiment is likely to be swung between the negatives of rising infection events 
that further delays discretionary travel and positive headlines on vaccines, with three Phase 3 trials already 
planned. We still see value in Ryanair and Wizz but remain neutral on the other key listed airlines," they say.
Separately, Nicolas Trindade, senior portfolio manager, fixed income at AXA Investment managers, believes that 
low-cost carriers are one of the most attractive opportunities at present.
Many budget carriers have strong balance sheets and carry relatively little debt, Trindade says, yet yields remain 
significantly elevated above pre-crisis levels.
Airline debt has not rallied in the same way other parts of the investment-grade debt universe has in recent months, 
and these companies' bonds are trading at prices that do not reflect the strength of their long-term fundamentals. 
This provides an attractive opportunity to fixed income investors, Trindade believes
The investment case is strengthened by the pick-up in activity that is occurring as many major European economies 
begin to emerge from lockdown, he argues.
"The strong financial position of these airlines was such that despite the relaxation in travel restrictions, they could 
quite conceivably go on for quite some time with no revenues at all. The airlines also have the benefit of 
unencumbered assets. They own their fleets rather than lease them, and have low debt levels associated with 
planes," he said.

Ryanair rules out Max PDPs for 12 months
Ryanair rules out Max PDPs for 12 months

Ryanair is unlikely to make any pre-delivery payments (PDP) over the next 12 months despite its intention to take 
delivery of 40 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in that period, Ryanair group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary has 
said.
Speaking on an analysts call on 27 July, O'Leary said that PDP payments form part of its negotiations with the US 
OEM over delays to the delivery of the type.
As such he does not expect any resumption of these PDP payments to "adversely affect our cash flows for the next 
12 months".
Ryanair hopes to accept delivery of its first Max before the end of 2020 and to have 40 by the summer of 2021.
The airline is renegotiating the price of deliveries and talking to Boeing about compensation for late deliveries, 
O'Leary says. These include a "significant" PDP petition. Negotiations are not expected to conclude until a firm 
delivery schedule is agreed.
Counting on 40 Max deliveries, but also 20 to 25 737-800s leaving the fleet when they come off lease or are sold, 
O'Leary says Ryanair will have little additional capacity in 2021.
Ryanair's other capital priority for the next 12 months is repaying the £600 million ($760 million) Corporate 
Financing Facility (CCFF) it borrowed earlier this year and to pay a (EURO)850 million ($1 billion) Eurobond which 
matures in June 2021.
Despite incurring a loss after tax of (EURO)185 million in the first quarter, from a (EURO)243 million profit in the 
same period a year before, Ryanair chief financial officer Neil Sorahan says the airline has a "strong" balance 
sheet.
The airline had (EURO)3.9 billion of cash at the end of the first quarter, a BB rating from Fitch and S&P and 333 
unencumbered aircraft with a conservative book value of (EURO)7 billion, which gives it "a lot of scope" for sale and 
lease opportunities or secured debt, although Sorahan says this is not something the Irish carrier is looking at 
presently.
Ryanair rules out Max PDPs for 12 months
Revenue fell by 95% to (EURO)125 million in the first quarter, from almost (EURO)2.2billion as traffic dropped 99% 
to 500,000.
Ryanair intends to return to 60% capacity in August and 70% by September. It needs to get a "better sense" of 
booking behaviour in September and October to calculate winter capacity, Sorahan says.
Cash burn since the return to operations has been "reasonably break even" leading to no diminution in cash 
reserves, he adds.
The airline expects 70% load factors in July and "something similar" in August, O'Leary says. A similar picture of 
neutral cash burn is predicted for the winter.
Ryanair is currently in discussions with lessors about the return of 14 737s due by May 2021.
"We are in discussion with lessors on those aircraft we would certainly be willing to extend those leases if we could 
do so on competitive terms," O'Leary says.
Lauda's planned fleet growth plan has been curtailed, with the Ryanair subsidiary now intending to keep a fleet size 
of 30 rather than 38 leased Airbus A320s by next summer.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) is hoping to secure its first 737 MAX jet from Boeing (BA) in November after the controversial 
plane's first flight test appeared to have gone well, the company's Chief Executive told Reuters.
The Irish-based budget carrier had ordered 210 737 MAX jets and is seeking compensation from the US aerospace 
giant for delays to deliveries, according to the report.
"Subject to the MAX being certified to return to service in North America, we would hope to be getting our first 
deliveries in November. This side of Christmas," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told the news agency.
"The first test flight was on Tuesday, that seems to have gone well and if that keeps on track then at least we hope 
to be welcoming our first 30-40 for summer 2021 and that would enable us to restart growth," O'Leary added.

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said premarket Wednesday it plans to fly more than 1,000 daily flights across Europe in July, a 
move aimed at bolstering business as the broader air travel and tourism industries try to recover during the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic.
The Irish budget carrier said the flights will originate from 200 European airports, restoring almost 90% of its route 
network prior to the onset of the health crisis. The flights will carry more than 4.5 million passengers, or about 40% 
of its normal July capacity.
Ryanair said it had flown about 250 flights each day during the last 10 days of June "to bring our aircraft, our crews 
and our maintenance teams back into service," said CEO Michael O'Leary in a statement.
New health measures to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 have been implemented for Ryanair's crews and 
customers, the company said.

Ryanair has seen "very strong" bookings for the first two weeks of July across its network, which it largely reopened 
on Wednesday, but expects ticket prices to be lower than ever for 12 months, Group Chief Executive Michael

It will likely take until 2022 or 2023 for ticket prices to return to the levels seen before the COVID-19 pandemic, 
O'Leary told Reuters. He said he expect to fly 4.5 million passengers in July and 5.5-6 million in August.

Jul 01, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With air-travel demand 
returning gradually, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] offered a rosy forecast with respect to 
the same for July. Per a Reuters report[2], the airline expects to carry more than 4.5 million passengers on its flights 
in the month. Even though the above reading marks a 70% decline from the actual number of passengers flown in 
last July, the same represents a marked improvement from the coronavirus-ravaged months of April and May. 
In fact we expect the June traffic numbers — to be released shortly — to sharply rise from the April and May 
readings.Moreover, Ryanair expanded its flight schedule to meet the anticipated increase in July traffic. Evidently, 
this presently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier aims to restore almost 90% of its routes from today. However, the 
routes will have fewer flights in operation than normal. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank 
(Strong Buy) stocks here.[3]As part of the strengthened flight network, Ryanair opened more than 60 routes to/from 
Austria beginning today. Further, the Vienna A320 base of Ryanair's Austrian unit, Laudamotion, reopened 
today.Apart from Ryanair, its counterparts in the United States, namely American Airlines AAL[4] and United 
Airlines UAL[5] are boosting their capacity. Both stocks currently carry the same Zacks Rank as Ryanair. Key PickA 
better-ranked stock in the broader Transportation [6]sector is Scorpio Tankers STNG[7], holding a Zacks Rank #2 
(Buy) at present.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Scorpio Tankers' current-year earnings has been revised 55% 
upward in the past 60 days.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a GenerationBe among the early investors in the new 
type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will 
soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it's expected to create 22 million jobs and 
generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new 
tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks' just-released special report

UK-based flight and cabin crew are set to be laid off by Easyjet as the short-haul airline also moves to close its 
bases at Stansted, Southend and Newcastle airports.Easyjet said in May that it would be cutting 4,500 jobs across 
Europe, a 30 per cent reduction in its workforce, in response to its fears that travel restrictions and passenger 
demand around the pandemic will mean poor trading conditions for the next two years at least. 
Of those job cuts, 727 will be UK-based pilots and another 1,300 cabin crew serving passengers in flight. It is the 
largest operator at Gatwick, Manchester and Luton, Britain's second, third and fifth largest airports. It will withdraw 
its seven planes from Stansted, the UK's fourth largest airport, dominated by rival Ryanair; its four planes at 
Southend, a serious blow to the aspirations of the Essex airport; and its three aircraft at Newcastle, reducing choice 
at one of Britain's top ten regional airports. 'The lower-demand environment means we need fewer aircraft and have 
less opportunity for work for our people,' Johan Lundgren, Easyjet's chief executive, said. Unite, the aviation union, 
described the announcement as yet another 'massive blow' for the industry. The union questioned Easyjet's 
decision to make workers redundant given the company took a 600 million loan from the government and recently 
paid a 174 million dividend to shareholders. Oliver Richardson, Unite national officer for civil aviation, said: 'The 
announcement further demonstrates why it is absolutely essential that the government extends its job retention 
scheme for the aviation sector, which has been one of the industries worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.' It has 
emerged that Easyjet's founder and largest shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has seen his and his family's 
interests fall to below 30 per cent. The billionaire previously spoke for about a third of the airline's shares. That 
triggered the ending of a 'relationship agreement', a stock market listing scheme designed to regulate the 
relationship between a leading shareholder and a quoted company. It does not affect the commercial agreements 
under which Sir Stelios is paid royalties for the airline to use the Easyjet brand. Read more: Easyjet to close Essex

Jul 01, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair could slash 3,000 jobs if it 
cannot agree pay cuts with pilots and cabin crew, the airlines CEOMichael O'Leary said on Wednesday. 'We've 
already announced about 3,500 job losses but we're engaged in extensive negotiations with our pilots, our cabin 
crew and we're asking them to all take pay cuts as an alternative to job losses,' O'Leary told BBC TV. Back in May, 
the Irish budget carrier had warned[1] it might need to cut 3,000 jobs, accounting for around 15% of its staff, 'as a 
direct result of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis'. The airline's restructuring and job cuts would commence from 
July 2020, with Ryanair currently being in pay negotiations with its staff. 'We're looking for 20% from the best paid 
captains, 5% from the lowest paid flight attendants and we think if we can negotiate those pay cuts by agreement, 
we 
can 
avoid 
most 
but 
not 
all 
job 
losses,' 
Ryanair's 
boss 
added.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l) has warned it may close its bases at Cork and Shannon airports and lay off up to 120 
pilots after talks with the Irish Airline Pilots' Association ended without agreement. The negotiations on job cuts 
reached the end of their legally required 30-day consultation period on June 26. The union then sought an 
extension, but the carrier accused the union of "stalling tactics", the Irish Times reported. Ryanair sent pilots a 
memo via the company's internal messaging system urging them to accept its proposals, which include a 20% pay 
cut that would gradually be reversed over four years, a range of work available via job shares, and unpaid leave. 
It asked pilots to click a button in the memo to accept. The size of the job losses - part of 3,000 planned job cuts in 
several markets - and whether bases at Cork and Shannon would remain, depend on the number of acceptances it 
received, it said. Fórsa, Ireland's largest public service union of which the Irish Airline Pilots' Association is a part, 
said in its own memo to pilots on June 26 that Ryanair's latest proposal was unacceptable as it would leave pilots 
temporarily on zero-hour contracts. It also provided no guarantee that job losses would be avoided, it said. The 
union added that it had written to Ryanair to "suggest an extension to work towards an agreement and indicating 
that we were happy to work with a third party" but had not received a reply. Ryanair, which is set to restore 40% of 
its capacity from July 1, has warned that it will be competing from now on against rivals such as Lufthansa, Air 
France, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines that have received billions of euros in government bailouts. The Irish 
government, meanwhile, has said it will lift quarantine rules on arriving passengers from July 9.

Low-cost airline easyJet on Tuesday said it had opened consultations on the closure of three British hubs and cuts 
of around 30 per cent in its staff.
The airline said it had begun talks with trade unions on cuts affecting "all of its UK-based pilots and crew," following 
an announcement last month that it could cut up to 4,500 of its 15,000 staff.
The proposals include closing three of easyJet's 11 airport hubs in Britain: Stansted and Southend, both close to 
London in south-eastern England; and Newcastle in the north-east.
The consultations are designed "with the aim of minimizing job losses as far as possible," it said, citing expectations 
that passenger demand will not recover to 2019 levels until 2023.
"These are very difficult proposals to put forward in what is an unprecedented and difficult time for the airline, and 
the industry as a whole," said Johan Lundgren, easyJet's chief executive.
"We are focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success so we can protect 
jobs going forward," Lundgren said.
Other British-based airlines have announced possible staff cuts, including 12,000 at British Airways and 3,000 at 
Ryanair.
An airport industry group also warned last week that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in Britain, with tens of 
thousands more at risk in businesses that indirectly depend upon airports.

Trade unions criticized low-cost airline easyJet on Tuesday as it opened consultations on the closure of three 
British hubs and cuts of around 30 per cent in its staff.
The airline said it had begun talks with trade unions on cuts affecting "all of its UK-based pilots and crew," following 
an announcement last month that it could cut up to 4,500 of its 15,000 staff.
The proposals include closing three of easyJet's 11 airport hubs in Britain: Stansted and Southend, both close to 
London in south-eastern England; and Newcastle in the north-east.
Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' trade union BALPA, accused the airline of "an excessive over-reaction" to 
the financial problems brought by the coronavirus pandemic.
Unite, which represents many easyJet cabin crew, said the announcement was a "massive blow."
EasyJet said the consultations are designed "with the aim of minimizing job losses as far as possible," citing 
expectations that passenger demand will not recover to 2019 levels until 2023.
"These are very difficult proposals to put forward in what is an unprecedented and difficult time for the airline, and 
the industry as a whole," said Johan Lundgren, easyJet's chief executive.
"We are focused on doing what is right for the company and its long-term health and success so we can protect 
jobs going forward," Lundgren said.
Oliver Richardson, a Unite national officer, said the cuts were "yet another massive blow to the aviation industry" 
and his thoughts are "with workers who face losing their jobs through no fault of their own."
Unions slam 'over-reaction' as easyJet opens talks on 4,500 job cuts
"There is no need for this announcement at this time, especially since easyJet has taken a multimillion-pounds 
government loan which it ought to be putting to use defending UK jobs," Richardson said.
Strutton said BALPA had been expecting easyJet to announce "temporary measures to help the airline through to 
recovery."
"But this seems an excessive over-reaction and easyJet won't find a supply of pilots waiting to come back when the 
recovery takes place over the next two years," he said.
"EasyJet paid 174 million pounds (214 million dollars) out to shareholders, got agreements to furlough staff to 
protect cash, got 600 million pounds from the government ... so why the panic?" Strutton asked.
"This is more evidence that aviation in the UK is caught in a death spiral of despair, and individual airlines are 
flailing around without direction," he said, urging the government to intervene in the industry.
Other British-based airlines have announced possible staff cuts, including 12,000 at British Airways and 3,000 at 
Ryanair.
An airport industry group also warned last week that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in Britain, with tens of 
thousands more at risk in businesses that indirectly depend upon airports.

 Ryanair's (RYA.L) pilots have until Wednesday to decide whether they support the British Airline Pilots 
Association's proposal of 20% pay cuts instead of the planned layoff of 334 pilots, Reuters reported on Monday 
citing the union.
The airline company claims the number of job cuts to be smaller if workers agree to pay cuts and productivity 
improvements.
Ryanair enforced a temporary 20% pay cut to minimize job cuts in Ireland.
The company's shares decreased about 1% on Tuesday morning.

CEO O'Leary cites concerns over taxes that could be imposed by the Austrian government.
Ryanair said it will take over many of the routes its Austrian-based subsidiary Lauda operates from Vienna (VIE) to 
ensure it can keep fares low.
Lauda will become a wet-lease provider for Ryanair, meaning the flights will be operated via Ryanair's air operator's 
certificate (AOC) but the aircraft-and even the livery-will still be Lauda. The move is being made so Ryanair/Lauda 
does not have to pay ticket taxes that Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary fears will be imposed on Austrian carriers.
"As Austrians' taxes get wasted on illegal state aid to German-owned Austrian Airlines, Ryanair will guarantee low 
fares for Austrian customers/visitors at prices which start from (EURO)9.99 [$11.22] one way," Ryanair said in a 
press release featuring the colorful language for which O'Leary and Ryanair are known.
Ryanair's 2020 summer schedule will feature 64 VIE routes, including flights to Dublin, Lisbon, Milan, Madrid, 
Naples and Warsaw.
"Our Vienna base will serve 64 routes, with air fares starting from just (EURO)9.99 one way before some crazy 
Austrian minister tries to force Austrian consumers and visitors to pay higher (EURO)40 air fares," O'Leary said in a 
statement. "Ryanair will provide non-state subsidized competition and choice to the high-fare Austrian Airlines ... 
Ryanair will oppose any illegal effort by the Austrian government to force consumers to pay high fares. Austrian 
citizens are entitled to low fares and nobody provides lower fares than Ryanair."

The governments of Germany, the Netherlands and France have offered financial bailout packages worth billions of 
euros to save their flag-carrier airlines from going bust, after the coronavirus pandemic brought the aviation industry 
to its knees.
The Dutch government has agreed to contribute (EURO)3.4bn (£3.07bn, $3.8bn) to a bailout of the Air France-KLM 
airline alliance.
The KLM rescue package will be a mixture of loans and guarantees, according to Reuters, and the Dutch 
government will appoint a trustee to the board. France got EU approval in May to offer a (EURO)7bn bailout to Air 
France, so in total, the partner airlines are set to get (EURO)10.4bn in state support.
In Germany, shareholders in Lufthansa approved the government bailout offer of (EURO)9bn on Thursday (25 
June), after weeks of deliberation and debate while the airline rapidly ran out of money.
The Lufthansa bailout is structured as (EURO)5.7bn of silent capital contribution and (EURO)3bn as a loan from 
state-owned development bank KfW. Berlin will also take a 20% stake in the airline, worth (EURO)300m, and get 
two supervisory board seats.
The government bought a stake at that price was an issue for Lufthansa's biggest shareholder Heinz Hermann 
Thiele, who could have torpedoed the deal, but backed it at the last minute.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in May that he intends to appeal to the European Commission over 
the Lufthansa bailout, which he slammed as "illegal state aid, which will massively distort competition."
In order to approve the Lufthansa rescue deal, the European competition regulator ordered the airline to give up 
some valuable landing slots at Frankfurt and Munich airports. It has also placed caps on executive salaries and 
been asked to waive dividends.
In the UK, British Airways owner IAG in May said it had requested £300m ($372m) from the government-backed 
Coronavirus Corporate Finance Facility.
The bailouts and loans will likely still fail to prevent massive job cuts across all airlines, including British Airways, 
Ryanair, Lufthansa, EasyJet, and Qantas. uk.finance.yahoo.com

Lufthansa's shareholders have voted through a (EURO)9bn bailout package that gives the German government a 
stake in the group almost a quarter of a century after it was privatised.
The deal, which allows Berlin to raise its holding to a blocking minority in the event of a hostile takeover bid, had 
been in jeopardy after the airline's largest investor, Heinz Hermann Thiele, indicated that he wanted to reopen talks 
with Angela Merkel's administration.
However, Mr Thiele, who built a 15.5 per cent position in the airline in the months following the Covid-19 outbreak 
and could have single-handedly blocked the bailout due to low turnout at yesterday's extraordinary general meeting, 
ended up supporting the package.
Overall, more than 98 per cent of those registered voted to back the deal.
In his opening remarks at the meeting, Carsten Spohr, chief executive, defended the size of the deal, which he had 
said was larger than the amount Lufthansa needed to avoid insolvency. "Viability is the sum of competitiveness plus 
ability to invest," the former pilot said.

Mr Spohr also said the German carrier, which had been burning through (EURO)1m an hour as most of its planes 
remained grounded, had "no alternative for meeting our capital requirements", and reiterated that Lufthansa would 
emerge from the crisis a smaller group, with at least 100 fewer aircraft.
Rival airline Ryanair has vowed to challenge the bailout in court.
The success of the vote is a blow to a number of US and UK hedge funds, which had stood to profit if the rescue 
package was scuppered.
Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global Investors, Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management and Paul Marshall's 
Marshall Wace are among those to have bet against the carrier, which is one of the three most-shorted stocks in 
Germany, according to data group IHS Markit.
Hedge funds piled into bets against Lufthansa in mid-March, as lockdown in the world's big economies forced 
airlines to halt most flights and a number of them to request government help.
Some traders expected the bailout to weigh further on the share price as it would dilute the stock. Short bets 
reached a high of 80m shares on loan in late May, according to IHS Markit, just after the rescue was announced.
However, Lufthansa shares rallied in anticipation of shareholders' approval, hitting funds hard.
Earlier yesterday, the European Commission approved the aid package, and last night, Lufthansa reached a deal 
with the independent flight attendants union UFO, securing savings of more than (EURO)500m through measures 
including the suspension of pay increases.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) announced Thursday it will have 67 routes to and from Austria beginning July 1. 
Of this number, 64 routes will be opened in Vienna. Ryanair will also open two routes to and from Salzburg and one

EasyJet 's cash call won't stop low-cost rivals soaring ahead
EasyJet's cash call won't stop low-cost rivals soaring ahead

Some things are worth paying for, even if they cost £400m. Leonardo da Vinci's Salvator Mundi, for example, if 
you're a Saudi prince. Newcastle United, yours for only £300m, if you've got a strong enough stomach for it. For 
easyJet, it seems £419m is the price worth paying for keeping its investment-grade credit rating.
The airline called on investors for cash in a 15 per cent placing launched on Wednesday evening, eventually done 
at a 5 per cent discount. Why now, when it has already scraped together £2.4bn in cash, and revenues are starting 
to come back after months of lockdown? Short answer: to keep the rating agencies sweet when it will have debt to 
refinance next year and needs to complete another £300m of sale and leasebacks. The £419m cash call should be 
enough to keep the credit rating up, and investors wouldn't easily fund a bigger issue.
EasyJet's balance sheet is not in dire shape. It is no Lufthansa, which has lined up a (EURO)9bn government 
bailout. Nor Air France-KLM, which secured its own multibillion-euro parachute.
Still, the airline is now starting to resemble one of the legacy flag carriers more than it does its low-cost rivals.
The group is on the defensive, shrinking its fleet and preparing for a dip in demand to last until 2023. It will act to 
protect its most profitable bases where it is able to charge premium prices for convenience and may retreat from 
more marginal airports.
EasyJet 's cash call won't stop low-cost rivals soaring ahead
Ryanair and Wizz Air can afford to be on the offensive. They look stronger and have lower costs. That gives them 
options. Even if there is not a sectorwide shakeout since some governments have stepped in, the two airlines are 
well placed to grow and pick off rivals when they fall by the wayside.
EasyJet is doing its best to catch up. It is cutting its cost base, laying off staff and scaling back spending on new 
Airbus planes. If the group pulls off the cost-cutting, leisure travel bounces back and customers flock to new 
easyJet holidays, it can get back on the front foot.
But the airline has a chequered record on trimming expenses. Its pledge to keep costs per seat excluding fuel to 
2019 levels next year - even as it restructures - looks pie in the sky.
The cash call is the price of steadying easyJet's finances and that's probably worth £419m, but not more.

Ryanair has filed a complaint to EU antitrust regulators about alleged talks between Lufthansa's Italian unit Air 
Dolomiti and three Italian airlines to fix prices, the chief legal officer of Europe's biggest budget airline said on 
Thursday.
The complaint also cites alleged price fixing in Austria involving Lufthansa's local unit Austrian Airlines.
"I can confirm that the price fixing cartel complaint was filed with the European Commission," Ryanair's Juliusz 
Gomorek told reporters.
"In Austria, where Lufthansa has a subsidiary, in the context of the bailout of that subsidiary, we have government 
officials talking about potentially introducing minimum prices," he said.
Earlier this month, Austria said it would introduce a minimum ticket price of on average 40 euros ($45), a shot at 
budget airlines' heavy discounts and following its 450 million-euro bailout of Lufthansa's Austrian Airlines.
Gomorek also pointed to Italy "where Lufthansa has its subsidiary, we have that subsidiary talking about getting 
together with three other airlines to discuss and maybe agree what price levels they may feel comfortable at."
The European Commission said it had received the complaint and would assess it.
Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines declined to comment.
Ryanair complains to EU antitrust watchdog about alleged Lufthansa price-fixing
Gomorek last week wrote to European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager's head of cabinet Kim 
Jorgensen calling for action against Lufthansa's Air Dolomiti, Alitalia, Neos and Blue Panorama, according to the 
letter seen by Reuters. (Reuters)

Jun 25, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Lufthansa 
shareholders on Thursday overwhelmingly backed a nine billion euro ($10 billion) bailout by the German 
government, saving Europe's largest airline group from bankruptcy after the coronavirus crushed travel 
demand.More than 98 percent of shareholders accounting for 39 percent of Lufthansa stock voted in favour of the 
resue package, chairman Karl-Ludwig Kley said after a special meeting held online because of the pandemic."We 
will make this work, thank you for your trust," Kley said.The bailout will see the German state take a 20-percent 
stake in the group, bringing it back on board for the first time since Lufthansa's 1997 privatisation. Employees of 
German airline Lufthansa hit the streets to encourage shareholders to back a bailout plan Photo: AFP / Tobias 
SCHWARZ CEO Carsten Spohr had earlier described the vote as a "historic moment" that would decide the fate of 
the airline giant.The approval was all but guaranteed after the group's biggest shareholder, German rail industry 
tycoon Heinz Hermann Thiele, dropped his objections to the bailout hours ahead of the crunch vote.He said 
although he still had doubts about the deal, which will dilute his own shareholding, he believed insolvency had to be 
avoided to stave off mass job losses. Dozens of Lufthansa employees rallied at Frankfurt airport during the 
shareholder meeting, many wearing face masks against the virus.

Daniel ROLAND "Lift us up where we belong, vote yes!" read one sign carried by a demonstrator, while another 
said "We are Lufthansa, we are family".Even with government aid, Spohr has warned Lufthansa may have to slash 
thousands of jobs as demand for flights is expected to stay below pre-pandemic levels for years. Low-cost airline 
Ryanair, which has complained about government rescues spoiling competition between airlines, has said it will 
challenge Lufthansa's bailout Photo: AFP / Oli SCARFF But in good news for the beleaguered group, it struck a 
deal with German flight attendants' union UFO late Wednesday to cut 500 million euros in costs by 2023 while 
avoiding cabin crew layoffs.The savings will be achieved through measures including pay freezes, reduced flight 
hours, early retirement and unpaid leave, both sides said.The deal still needs to be approved by union members but 
UFO spokesman Nicoley Baublies said it "brings urgently needed job security" for Lufthansa's 22,000 flight 
attendants.Spohr said talks with the VC pilots' union were headed in a similar direction but that negotiations with the 
powerful Verdi union representing ground staff were "disappointing". Lufthansa, like many other airlines, has been 
swamped by demands for refunds just as it needs to hold on to cash to survive Photo: AFP / Christof STACHE 
Verdi and VC both hailed the shareholders' green light, with the pilots' union calling it a "step in the right direction" 
that allows for the "orderly continuation" of Lufthansa operations.As part of its okay, the European Commission said 
Lufthansa would have to make room for rivals at the Frankfurt and Munich airports to ensure fair competition.It also

put limits on any Lufthansa acquisitions of competitors and banned dividends until the state aid is 
repaid.Nevertheless, low-cost rival Ryanair immediately announced it would challenge Lufthansa's rescue in an EU 
court.Air travel has picked up in recent days as countries emerge from lockdown but Lufthansa's climb out of the 
coronavirus storm promises to be long and arduous.The group expects its timetable to still remain 60 percent below 
pre-pandemic levels come September.Further into the future, around 100 of Lufthansa's present fleet of 763 aircraft 
will likely be surplus to requirements.Spohr told shareholders the group would "work very hard" to "repay every 
cent" of the bailout but cautioned that a smaller Lufthansa would emerge from the crisis.He also acknowledged that 
many customers were "disappointed and upset" over the delays in getting their cancelled flights refunded after the 
virus prompted countries to slam their borders shut earlier this year."I assure you: every customer who wants a 
refund will get their money back," Spohr said, vowing to clear the backlog worth hundreds of millions of euros within 
six weeks.Lufthansa has also sought support from other governments to shore up subsidiaries.Vienna has granted 
Austrian Airlines aid totalling 450 million euros, while Swiss and Edelweiss received loans totalling 1.2 billion euros 
from Bern.Talks continue with the Belgian government over Brussels Airlines, which plans to shed 1,000 jobs.

Lufthansa was poised to clear a key shareholder vote on its nine billion euro ($10 billion) state rescue Thursday, 
boosted by the EU's green light and the last-minute backing of a billionaire investor who had the power to veto the 
plan.The European Commission said it had approved the German government's six billion euro cash injection to 
keep Lufthansa afloat after the coronavirus pandemic pummelled the airline industry, but imposed strict 
conditions.The massive rescue package also includes three billion euros in public loan guarantees and would see 
Berlin taking a 20 percent stake in the airline giant.Shareholders began a virtual meeting at 1000 GMT to vote on 
the bailout, with CEO Carsten Spohr warning that Lufthansa faced bankruptcy if they reject it. Employees of

Air services group Swissport has announced plans to halve its UK workforce because of the huge slowdown in 
international travel.
Jason Holt, chief executive of Swissport Western Europe, wrote to employees yesterday to tell them that about 
4,500 of its 8,500-strong workforce in the UK and Ireland would be cut.
The UK airport trade association has warned separately that up to 20,000 jobs are at now at risk in the sector, 
which has been hit hard by the shutdown caused by the pandemic. One of the largest operators of airport dutyfree 
shops, Dufry, said yesterday that it aimed to cut employee costs by up to a third to help shore up its finances.
In his message to Swissport employees, Mr Holt said that the job cuts were essential to "secure the lifeline of 
funding from lenders and investors to protect as many jobs as possible".
He wrote: "We are now facing a long period of uncertainty and reduced flight numbers, along with significant 
changes taking place to the way people travel and the way goods move around the world. There is no escaping the 
fact that the industry is smaller than it was, and it will remain so for some time to come."
He added that the company's revenue was forecast to be almost 50 per cent lower than last year. Business leaders 
from the industry have been warning the government that they needed immediate help to reduce the risk of damage 
to the wider UK supply chain.
Grounded planes force Swissport to halve UK staff
Airlines are already in the process of cutting thousands of jobs. British Airways is axing up to 12,000, while Ryanair 
and easyJet are cutting up to 15 per cent and 30 per cent of their workforces, respectively.
Mr Holt said ground handlers operated on a low-margin, high-volume business model. "We are fundamentally 
reliant on a high volume of flights taking place - whether for cargo, ground handling or lounge operations. When 
aircraft aren't flying, our source of revenue evaporates."
Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, the UK trade body, reiterated calls for the UK 
government to cancel its 14-day quarantine policy for everyone arriving in the country. "Government needs to 
recognise the immense crisis facing the airport communities and take action to ... protect livelihoods," she said.

He wrote: "We are now facing a long period of uncertainty and reduced flight numbers, along with significant 
changes taking place to the way people travel and the way goods move around the world. There is no escaping the 
fact that the industry is smaller than it was, and it will remain so for some time to come."
He added that the company's revenue was forecast to be almost 50 per cent lower than last year. Business leaders 
from the industry have been warning the government that they needed immediate help to reduce the risk of damage 
to the wider UK supply chain.

Airlines are already in the process of cutting thousands of jobs. British Airways is axing up to 12,000, while Ryanair 
and easyJet are cutting up to 15 per cent and 30 per cent of their workforces, respectively.
Mr Holt said ground handlers operated on a low-margin, high-volume business model. "We are fundamentally 
reliant on a high volume of flights taking place - whether for cargo, ground handling or lounge operations. When 
aircraft aren't flying, our source of revenue evaporates."
Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, the UK trade body, reiterated calls for the UK 
government to cancel its 14-day quarantine policy for everyone arriving in the country. "Government needs to 
recognise the immense crisis facing the airport communities and take action to ... protect livelihoods," she said.

Air services group Swissport has announced plans to halve its UK workforce because of the huge slowdown in 
international travel.
Jason Holt, chief executive of Swissport Western Europe, wrote to employees yesterday to tell them that about 
4,500 of its 8,500-strong workforce in the UK and Ireland would be cut.
The UK airport trade association has warned separately that up to 20,000 jobs are at now at risk in the sector, 
which has been hit hard by the shutdown caused by the pandemic. One of the largest operators of airport dutyfree 
shops, Dufry, said yesterday that it aimed to cut employee costs by up to a third to help shore up its finances.
In his message to Swissport employees, Mr Holt said that the job cuts were essential to "secure the lifeline of 
funding from lenders and investors to protect as many jobs as possible".
He wrote: "We are now facing a long period of uncertainty and reduced flight numbers, along with significant

Transport secretary Grant Shapps said yesterday that agreeing "travel corridors" with other European countries, 
which would enable travellers to avoid contentious quarantine restrictions, was a "massive priority".
The UK is set to announce plans for travel corridors with as many as 10 countries on Monday, and although the list 
has not been finalised, it is expected to include France, Spain, Greece, Denmark and Belgium.
Under the plans, people arriving in the UK from these countries would be exempt from the 14-day quarantine that 
was introduced on June 8 in an effort to stop a second wave of coronavirus infections.
Ministers are keen to put the plans in place by July 4 so that Britons would have the chance to go on holiday in the 
Mediterranean without being affected by quarantine restrictions.
This is also the date when people in England will be allowed to go on domestic holidays following the latest phase 
of lockdown easing.
The UK's quarantine policy for the pandemic was introduced much later than many other countries, some of which 
are now easing the restrictions, including certain European nations.
Boris Johnson justified the policy as a means to prevent a fresh surge in virus infections in the UK.
But business groups have argued that the quarantine restrictions are unnecessary and further damage the 
economy that is reeling from the Covid-19 crisis.
Plan for travel corridors with Europe to be given priority; Transport
Mr Shapps for the first time set out the criteria by which travel corridors can be agreed with other countries.
He said the UK would consider the level and trajectory of Covid-19 infections in other nations as well as whether 
they had proper social-distancing rules and a test-and-trace system for the virus, or something equivalent.
Mr Shapps defended the quarantine restriction, although he admitted there were arguments inside the government 
about whether it should have been introduced sooner in the crisis.
He said Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, had told him the policy would "not be a solution" to tackling 
the virus from the outset.
The aviation industry has a call scheduled with the government today to discuss the possible introduction of travel 
corridors with European countries and the quarantine policy.
British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair this month started legal action against the government over the policy, calling 
it "flawed".
Mr Shapps, meanwhile, said that the virus had been a "complete disaster" for airlines and airports, including ground 
handlers. "I understand entirely the pain that aviation is going through," he added.
Swissport, one of the leading airport ground handlers in Britain, announced plans yesterday to halve its UK and 
Ireland workforce by cutting more than 4,500 jobs.
Karen Dee, chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, a trade body, said the job losses showed a "key 
component of the UK's infrastructure is on its knees".
The AOA said up to 20,000 jobs were at risk within the industry.

Shareholders Back Bailout To Rescue Lufthansa

Jun 25, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Lufthansa 
shareholders on Thursday overwhelmingly backed a nine billion euro ($10 billion) bailout by the German 
government, saving Europe's largest airline group from bankruptcy after the coronavirus crushed travel demand. 
Over 98 percent of shareholders accounting for 39 percent of Lufthansa stock voted in favour of the resue package 
in a special meeting held online because of the pandemic. "We will make this work, thank you for your trust," 
chairman Karl-Ludwig Kley said.The bailout will see the German state take a 20-percent stake in the group, bringing 
it back on board for the first time since Lufthansa's 1997 privatisation. 
CEO Carsten Spohr said the shareholders' green light gave Lufthansa and its 138,000 employees "a perspective 
for a successful future". Ahead of the vote, Spohr urged investors to seize a "historic moment" to secure the 
survival of the airline giant. Lufthansa employees have taken to the pavement to encourage shareholders to 
approve the deal AFP / Daniel ROLAND Their blessing was all but guaranteed after the group's biggest 
shareholder, German rail industry tycoon Heinz Hermann Thiele, dropped his objections to the bailout at the 11th 
hour. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier called the green light "good news" for employees and said the 
rescue package gave Lufthansa the chance "to overcome the biggest crisis in its history". The government "will not 
meddle" in Lufthansa's day-to-day business, he added. Low-cost airline Ryanair, which has complained about 
government rescues spoiling competition between airlines, has said it will challenge Lufthansa's bailout AFP / Oli 
SCARFF  Dozens of Lufthansa employees rallied at Frankfurt airport Thursday, many wearing face masks against 
the virus.  "Lift us up where we belong, vote yes!" read one sign carried by a demonstrator, while another said "We 
are Lufthansa, we are family". Lufthansa, like many other airlines, has been swamped by demands for refunds just 
as it needs to hold on to cash to survive AFP / Christof STACHE Even with government aid, Spohr has warned 
Lufthansa may have to slash thousands of jobs as demand for flights is expected to stay below pre-pandemic levels 
for years. But in a boost for the beleaguered group, it struck a deal with German flight attendants' union UFO late 
Wednesday to cut 500 million euros in costs by 2023 while avoiding cabin crew layoffs. The savings will be 
achieved through measures including pay freezes, reduced flight hours, early retirement and unpaid leave, both 
sides said. The agreement still needs to be approved by union members but UFO spokesman Nicoley Baublies said 
it "brings urgently needed job security" for Lufthansa's 22,000 flight attendants. German airline Lufthansa's CEO, 
Carsten Spohr, pleads with shareholders to save the company AFPTV / Spohr said talks with the VC pilots' union 
were headed in a similar direction but negotiations with the powerful Verdi union representing ground staff were 
"disappointing". Verdi and VC both hailed Thursday's vote outcome, with the pilots' union calling it a "step in the 
right direction" that allows for the "orderly continuation" of Lufthansa operations.Earlier Thursday, the European 
Shareholders Back Bailout To Rescue Lufthansa
Commission also signed off on the Lufthansa bailout, which consists of a six-billion-euro capital injection from Berlin 
and three billion in public loan guarantees. But the EU imposed strict conditions, saying Lufthansa would have to 
make room for rivals at the Frankfurt and Munich airports to ensure fair competition. Nevertheless, low-cost rival 
Ryanair immediately announced it would challenge Lufthansa's rescue in an EU court. Global air travel has picked 
up recently as lockdowns are lifted but the airline industry's climb out of the coronavirus storm promises to be long 
and arduous. Lufthansa expects its timetable to still remain 60 percent below pre-pandemic levels come 
September. Further into the future, around 100 of Lufthansa's present fleet of 763 aircraft will likely be surplus to 
requirements. Spohr told shareholders the group would "work very hard" to "repay every cent" of the state aid to 
taxpayers, but warned that Lufthansa would emerge smaller from the crisis.He also acknowledged that many 
customers were "disappointed and upset" over the delays in getting their cancelled flights refunded after countries 
slammed their borders shut earlier this year because of COVID-19. "I assure you: every customer who wants a 
refund will get their money back," Spohr said, vowing to clear the backlog worth hundreds of millions of euros within 
six weeks. Lufthansa has also sought support from other governments to shore up subsidiaries.Talks continue with 
the Belgian government over Brussels Airlines, which plans to shed 1,000 jobs.

 Ryanair (RYA.L) will contest Germany's 9 billion euro ($10.1 billion) rescue of Lufthansa before an EU court, media 
reports said Thursday, citing Juliusz Gomorek, the chief legal officer of the low-cost airline. 
Lufthansa is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting later on Thursday, in which shareholders will vote 
on the proposed government bailout, according to reports. It was approved by the European Union earlier in the 
day.
The 9 billion euro rescue was negotiated between Lufthansa, the German government and the European 
Commission, which on Thursday officially cleared the bailout.

The German government will take a 20-per-cent stake in Germany's top air carrier, Lufthansa, clearing the way for 
9 billion euros (10 billion dollars) in state aid for the crisis-hit airline.
Shareholders approved the move on Thursday following a day of deliberations in which company executives asked 
for assistance to stay in business, after the coronavirus pandemic grounded the company.
Valued at around 300 million euros, that stake is only a small part of the total package - but it has irked investors, 
who will see their own shares diluted as a result of the state intervention. It has also angered competitors, who see 
a national champion being bailed out despite EU rules against just that.
"This is a spectacular case of a rich EU member state ignoring the EU treaties to the benefit of its national industry 
and the detriment of poorer countries," Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement before the 
decision was announced.

in July &August; before some misguided Austrian Minister tries to ban them.
 Ryanair noted that it will operate to/from Vienna on a mixture of Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Since Lauda will 
become a wet lease provider for the Ryanair Group, the famous red brand will continue to fly over the skies of 
Austria from 1st July.

An airport industry group on Wednesday said more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in Britain due to the economic 
impact the coronavirus pandemic, amid reports that Swissport plans to cut more than 4,000 jobs.
The Airport Operators' Association called for government help after its analysis suggested that 20,000 airport jobs 
are at risk in Britain "as the full effects of the [coronavirus] pandemic on the global airline community begin to be 
felt."
More than 110,000 jobs could be lost if firms providing services to airports or indirectly dependent upon them are 
included, the AOA said.
Trade unions and British media reported on Wednesday that Swissport has told staff that it plans consultations on 
cutting about half of its 9,000 jobs in Britain.
AOA chief executive Karen Dee said Britain's commercial aviation sector had "weathered the worst three months in 
its history."
Dee urged the government to drop its "arbitrary quarantine policy, which has unnecessarily stifled the sector's 
restart and recovery plans."
"These [AOA] jobs figures clearly show that a key component of the UK's infrastructure is on its knees, with no relief 
to the current crisis expected," she added.
The government has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international arrivals in Britain, which airlines warned 
could bring "economic disaster."
British airports say 20,000 jobs at risk; Swissport plans cuts
It later announced planned exemptions for arrivals from European nations popular with British holidaymakers, 
including Spain and Portugal.
Airlines said the government had effectively banned people from travelling to countries with lower coronavirus 
infection rates than Britain.
Broadcaster Sky News quoted a memo to Swissport's 8,500 staff in Britain and Ireland, from Jason Holt, its chief 
executive for Western Europe, as saying the company had to "adapt to this new reality" in which air traffic was not 
forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until as late as 2024.
Holt said Swissport, which provides baggage handling and other services at most British regional airports, planned 
to start consultations on the possible cutting of 4,556 positions.
Trade unions GMB and Unite, which represent many Swissport staff, said the plan to cut jobs was "devastating 
news."
The unions urged the government to provide "a bespoke financial package ... to support the aviation industry and 
save thousands of jobs as the economy continues to reopen."
Major British airlines have also announced possible staff cuts, including 12,000 at British Airways, 4,500 at easyJet 
and 3,000 at Ryanair.

Airport operator Swissport on Wednesday announced plans to cut more then 4,000 staff in Britain and Ireland, as 
an industry group warned that tens of thousands of airport-linked jobs are at risk following the coronavirus 
pandemic.
Jason Holt, chief executive for western Europe, told Swissport's 8,500 staff in Britain and Ireland that the company 
had to "adapt to this new reality" in which air traffic was not forecast to recover to pre-pandemic levels until as late 
as 2024.
Holt said in a memo that Swissport, which provides baggage handling and other services at most British regional 
airports, planned to start consultations on the possible cutting of 4,556 positions.
In a later statement, Holt said the pandemic had "hit [Swissport] hard, beginning with the collapse of [regional 
airline] Flybe back in March."
The company had lost about 75 per cent of its revenue during the pandemic, he said.
"We now must adapt to the unfortunate reality that there simply aren't enough aircraft flying for our business to 
continue running as it did before Covid-19; and there won't be for some time to come," Holt said.
"We expect upwards of 4,000 will leave us, comprising around 50 per cent of our workforce," he said, adding that 
the entire aviation industry is facing "very challenging, existential times."
The Airport Operators' Association (AOA) said its analysis suggested that more than 20,000 jobs could be lost in 
Britain, or more than 110,000 jobs if firms providing services to airports or indirectly dependent upon them are 
included.
Swissport to cut 4,000 British jobs; airports warn many more at risk
Trade unions GMB and Unite, which represent many Swissport staff, said the plan to cut jobs was "devastating 
news."
The unions urged the government to provide "a bespoke financial package ... to support the aviation industry and 
save thousands of jobs as the economy continues to reopen."
Major British airlines have also announced possible staff cuts, including 12,000 at British Airways, 4,500 at easyJet 
and 3,000 at Ryanair.
AOA chief executive Karen Dee said Britain's commercial aviation sector had "weathered the worst three months in 
its history."
Dee urged the government to drop its "arbitrary quarantine policy, which has unnecessarily stifled the sector's 
restart and recovery plans."
"These [AOA] jobs figures clearly show that a key component of the UK's infrastructure is on its knees, with no relief 
to the current crisis expected," she added.
The government has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all international arrivals in Britain, which airlines warned 
could bring "economic disaster."
It later announced planned exemptions for arrivals from European nations popular with British holidaymakers, 
including Spain and Portugal.
Airlines said the government had effectively banned people from travelling to countries with lower coronavirus 
infection rates than Britain.

Austria 's Lauda to shrink fleet, drop in-house ops
Austria's Lauda to shrink fleet, drop in-house ops

Lauda (OE, Vienna) has announced it will cap its fleet at thirty A320-200s going forward and although it will 
exclusively operate under the code of its parent Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), it will retain its own branding. The 
Austrian subsidiary of Ryanair Holdings said that thanks to a recent agreement with its unions, its key Vienna base 
would reopen on July 1 with over 330 flight crew positions. However, the number of Airbus narrowbodies based out 
of the Austrian capital will decrease from 16 to just 10. The remaining 20 aircraft operated by Lauda will be based 
out of its remaining bases at Düsseldorf Int'l, Stuttgart Manfred Rommel, and Palma de Mallorca airport. 
The carrier said that its foreign bases' staffing needs were "under review". Besides shrinking its fleet, Lauda 
announced that it would henceforth operate as a wet-lease specialist within the group. Thus far, the Austrian airline 
was the only Ryanair Holdings' unit to operate under its own brand and code. The group's other subsidiaries - Buzz 
(RR, Warsaw Modlin), Malta Air (AL, Malta Int'l), and Ryanair UK (RK, London Stansted) - all of which exclusively 
fly under Ryanair's FR code. And while the UK airline does not have its own brand identity, both the Polish and the 
Maltese units do. As such, Ryanair Holdings will continue to operate as a multi-brand group on a marketing level 
but will revert to a single-code operationally. AviationNetOnline reported that in the short-term, some non-European 
Union flights may continue under Lauda's OE code (assuming they are cleared to operate) due to traffic rights 
allocated to the Austrian carrier rather than its Irish parent.

Highlight: Manchester Airport has announced its plans to reopen Terminal 3 on 1 July with social distancing 
measures in place.
Body
Airlines that will return to Terminal 3 from next month are British Airways, Ryanair, Air France, KLM, Eastern 
Airways, and Loganair. Terminal 1 was reopened on 25 March. The terminals were closed due to the Covid-19 
pandemic. A range of safety measures at the airport have been put in place, including deep cleaning, conducting 
temperature checks, and urging passengers to wear face coverings. Pre-booked security slots at Manchester 
Airport, which is the third largest airport in the UK, are also being trialled since last week. With this move, 
Manchester Airport became the first airport in the UK to offer a pre-booking system for security to keep passenger 
queues shorter. Passengers can now reserve a 15-minute window to use a dedicated lane so that they can directly 
go to a checkpoint in a bid to cut down queue sizes. Manchester Airport chief operating officer Brad Miller said: 
"We've been trialling a lot of safety measures for the last month to ensure they are appropriate and firmly in place 
ahead of airlines ramping up their operations. "We are confident we have the right mix of things in place to facilitate 
safe travel and allow passengers to fly with confidence." Emirates, Eastern Airways and Swiss Airlines are among a 
range of carriers that have either announced or restarted some of their operations from Manchester Airport.

Jun 23, 2020( Free Movement: http://www.freemovement.org.uk Delivered by Newstex)  In the case of C‑754/18[1] 
Ryanair the Court of Justice of the European Union has concluded that a non-EU national who holds a permanent 
residence card from one EU state, is under EU law, exempt from any domestic law requirement to hold a visa to 
enter anotherEU state. The judgment effectively overrules the Court of Appeal judgment in Ryanair v Secretary of 
State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 899[2] (see our write up of that earlier case here: Carriers' 
liability: Ryanair challenges the Secretary of State - and loses[3]). The CJEU reaches this conclusion despite there 
being no express provision to this effect in Directive 2004/38: only a residence card is specifically mentioned. 
This was no barrier to the CJEU, which considered it absurd and counterproductive for one of the benefits of a 
residence card to be lost when the status is upgraded to permanent residence.  The court also finds that other 
member states must accept a permanent residence card issued in a different member state as proof that status is 
genuinely held. This runs contrary to the current Home Office interpretation of the significance of possessing 
residence documentation issued in EU countries. The judgment is an important one for airlines and for passengers, 
given that carrier liability laws were until now effectively forcing airlines to deny boarding to non-EU family members 
with 
permanent 
residence 
cards 
and 
no 
visa.

Highlight: East Midlands Airport (EMA) in the UK restarted limited passenger flight operations on 21 June.
Body
The non-essential passenger operations were suspended due to the travel restrictions and health concerns amid 
the global Covid-19 pandemic. The first flight to take off was a Ryanair flight. 
During June, 16 flights by Ryanair will be operated. Fuller schedules are expected to be implemented next month. 
The Ryanair flight from Alicante arrived at the airport at 15:11pm local time, following which the flight departed to 
the same destination. This is the first instance in around 13 weeks that passengers have entered the airport after 
the shutdown. Passengers are required to wear face coverings in the airport and all arriving passengers should 
undergo a 14-day quarantine. While passenger operations were suspended, East Midlands Airport continued to 
operate cargo flights and is reported to have become one of the ten busiest airports in Europe during the lockdown. 
Due to the pandemic, the airport's passenger income streams were affected, which led to lay-offs of airport staff 
and the re-assessment of costs, fees and charges. For example, the airport has increased its rapid drop off (RDO) 
rates to Â£4 for 15 minutes from the previous Â£3 for ten minutes. London City Airport in the UK also restarted 
passenger operations. Last week, Manchester Airport announced that it will trial pre-booking of 15-minute security 
slots, in a bid to boost the experience and restore confidence in travel after the Covid-19 pandemic.

B ring on summer," said American Airlines as it announced plans to restart more than 55 per cent of its domestic 
flights in July. Ryanair is offering one-way tickets for as little as (EURO)19.99 as it aims to restore 40 per cent of its 
services next month.
The airlines are rushing to put more aircraft into the skies, but are the passengers ready to fly? Not really. In the 
UK, 81 per cent of people surveyed in May said that they had no plans to travel outside the country in the next four 
months, according to UBS Evidence Lab, the bank's data arm, which has been tracking consumers' intentions.
Even in countries where coronavirus infections are under tighter control, people are reluctant to head for the airport. 
In South Korea, more than 80 per cent said in April that they had no travel plans, although a survey in May showed 
this had fallen to 70 per cent and the number prepared to travel outside Asia had gone up from 6 per cent to 11 per 
cent.
Some passengers who flew in the past few weeks have found the experience strange but not too stressful, if only 
because they had the airport and aircraft almost to themselves. One traveller who took an American Airlines flight 
from San Jose to Dallas Fort Worth airport and then to London's Heathrow in late May told me his overwhelming 
impression was of the emptiness of the facilities. He saw only two other passengers on the inter-terminal train at 
DFW - and they were airport staff.
When will we fly again? Airlines are rushing to put planes in the skies but passengers are reluctant to board. 
From social distancing to luggage rules, Michael ....
The traveller said the unharried check-in clerk was behind Plexiglas. There were hand-sanitiser stations dotted 
through the building. There were no queues to get through security and no problems with social distancing at the 
gate - because hardly anyone was boarding his flight. There was no question of having to sit next to another 
passenger: there were so few on board that when, after settling into his window seat, someone else sat on the 
aisle, cabin crew moved him to a three-seat row of his own. Queues for the toilets? There weren't any.
That will all change if people start flying in greater numbers, as the plans being laid out by airline associations, 
governments and regulators make clear. It's important to get these procedures right, the European Union Aviation 
Safety Agency (Easa) said. In one alarming section of its safety protocol for airlines it said: "An increase in cases of 
unruly or disruptive passengers should be expected, either prior to departure or in-flight. This may be due to 
passengers not wishing to sit next to each other or accusing each other of not following the rules. There is a strong 
potential for conflict if it is not managed properly. In the worst case, panic could become quite a serious threat to 
flight safety."
So how do we avoid that? First, dissuade people with possible Covid-19 symptoms from going to the airport. 
"Passengers should provide a statement regarding their Covid-19 status before being issued a boarding pass," 
Easa said, adding that airlines "should make passengers aware of the consequences of making a false statement 
and the fact that symptomatic passengers detected at the airport may not be allowed to continue their travel".
Should airports and airlines take passengers' temperatures as they enter or before they board? There is little 
evidence that it is effective, Easa says. Earlier epidemics, such as the Sars outbreak, suggested temperature 
screening was "a high-cost low-efficiency measure". Covid-19 can be asymptomatic. It can also be infectious before 
any symptoms appear. If temperature-checking played any useful role, Easa said, it was in dissuading those who 
are ill from travelling or reassuring those who aren't that they didn't have infectious fellowpassengers on the flight.
If you do fly, you will be saying goodbye to your loved ones outside the airport terminal. The UK Department for 
Transport instructions, issued last week, match Easa's: the only non-passengers allowed into the terminal will be 
those assisting a disabled passenger or escorting a child who will be travelling unaccompanied. Much of airport and 
aircraft life will mirror what happens elsewhere in these pandemic times: passengers will be told to keep their 
distance from others and clean their hands constantly. But some older aspects of flying will be turned upside down. 
This applies particularly to checking in bags and hand luggage. The airlines' push in recent years has been to deter 
the checking-in of luggage. The result has been a battle for overhead locker space as passengers have brought as 
much as they could on board: wheeled suitcases, laptop bags, handbags and whatever else they could get past the 
flight attendants at the door.
The new rules are: as little hand luggage as possible - check in whatever you can. As both the UK transport 
department and Easa say: the fewer onboard bags there are, the quicker boarding and disembarking will be and the 
less chance there is of opening or closing a latch that another hand has touched. Easa says airlines should 
encourage checking in luggage "by implementing incentive policies".
The pre-pandemic incentive policies went the other way: for many airlines, the more luggage you checked in, the 
more you paid. Are they really going to reverse this? I asked easyJet whether it intended to eliminate or reduce its 
checked baggage charges, which go up to £37.49 for a 23kg bag. EasyJet said it had no current plans to reduce 
hold luggage charges but would "review" the situation regularly.
Under Easa's plans, there will no longer be duty-free sales on board. Inflight food should be pre-packed and sealed 
and drinks should be in cans. Passengers should wear face masks from the moment they enter the airport and 
throughout the flight. If you're on a longhaul flight you should bring enough masks to change them every four hours. 
If any passenger shows signs after takeoff of Covid-19, including "fever, persistent cough, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
difficulty breathing or other flu-like symptoms", they should be isolated on board, with two empty rows in each 
direction if possible, and the closest toilet reserved for the sick passenger.
When will we fly again? Airlines are rushing to put planes in the skies but passengers are reluctant to board. 
From social distancing to luggage rules, Michael ....
The whole toilet situation sounds pretty fraught. Even if there are no symptomatic passengers on board, Easa say 
that one toilet should be reserved for the crew. Airlines should not allow queues for the others. Ryanair says 
passengers will have to ask for permission to go to the loo.
None of this sounds much fun, and the airlines, understandably, are keen to assure us that the chances of 
contracting Covid-19 on a flight are low. The International Air Transport Association's medical director said there 
was sparse evidence that a coronavirus-afflicted passenger could infect others on board. A flight from the US to 
Taiwan at the end of March that subsequently turned out to have had 12 symptomatic passengers caused no 
problems for the other 328 passengers and crew members who all tested negative. An informal survey of 18 large 
airlines identified, from January to March, just three cases of in-flight transmission of coronavirus, all from 
passengers to crew, and four cases of pilot to pilot infection, which could have taken place during the flight or 
before or after it.
There were no cases of passenger to passenger transmission on these flights, which was also confirmed in 
information Iata requested from 70 airlines representing half of global traffic. The only suspected case of large-scale 
in-flight infection was on a flight from the UK to Vietnam in early March in which one passenger was thought to have 
infected 14 others, 12 of whom were sitting nearby. Iata said a formal study into this flight was expected to take 
place.
It helps, Iata said, that passengers all face the same direction, that they are protected from those in front and 
behind by seat backs, that cabin air flow is from ceiling to floor and that modern planes have high efficiency 
particulate air (Hepa) filters that are effective at trapping viruses.
Will this be enough to persuade millions to fly? Possibly not at first. That will probably take a worldwide vaccination 
programme or widespread immunity through past infection, and we are a long way from that. As Iata concedes, the 
numbers who have had the disease are still low - and we don't know how long immunity lasts. But the queues of 
people prepared to enter shops after a long lockdown suggest many are itching to get back to normal. If the price is 
right this summer, a fair number may want to get away. But for now, flying looks like an activity for the young and 
less vulnerable - or the reckless and the brave.

aisle, cabin crew moved him to a three-seat row of his own. Queues for the toilets? There weren't any.
That will all change if people start flying in greater numbers, as the plans being laid out by airline associations, 
governments and regulators make clear. It's important to get these procedures right, the European Union Aviation 
Safety Agency (Easa) said. In one alarming section of its safety protocol for airlines it said: "An increase in cases of 
unruly or disruptive passengers should be expected, either prior to departure or in-flight. This may be due to 
passengers not wishing to sit next to each other or accusing each other of not following the rules. There is a strong 
potential for conflict if it is not managed properly. In the worst case, panic could become quite a serious threat to 
flight safety."
So how do we avoid that? First, dissuade people with possible Covid-19 symptoms from going to the airport. 
"Passengers should provide a statement regarding their Covid-19 status before being issued a boarding pass," 
Easa said, adding that airlines "should make passengers aware of the consequences of making a false statement 
and the fact that symptomatic passengers detected at the airport may not be allowed to continue their travel".
Should airports and airlines take passengers' temperatures as they enter or before they board? There is little 
evidence that it is effective, Easa says. Earlier epidemics, such as the Sars outbreak, suggested temperature 
screening was "a high-cost low-efficiency measure". Covid-19 can be asymptomatic. It can also be infectious before 
any symptoms appear. If temperature-checking played any useful role, Easa said, it was in dissuading those who 
are ill from travelling or reassuring those who aren't that they didn't have infectious fellowpassengers on the flight.
If you do fly, you will be saying goodbye to your loved ones outside the airport terminal. The UK Department for 
Transport instructions, issued last week, match Easa's: the only non-passengers allowed into the terminal will be 
those assisting a disabled passenger or escorting a child who will be travelling unaccompanied. Much of airport and 
aircraft life will mirror what happens elsewhere in these pandemic times: passengers will be told to keep their 
distance from others and clean their hands constantly. But some older aspects of flying will be turned upside down. 
This applies particularly to checking in bags and hand luggage. The airlines' push in recent years has been to deter 
the checking-in of luggage. The result has been a battle for overhead locker space as passengers have brought as 
much as they could on board: wheeled suitcases, laptop bags, handbags and whatever else they could get past the 
flight attendants at the door.
The new rules are: as little hand luggage as possible - check in whatever you can. As both the UK transport 
department and Easa say: the fewer onboard bags there are, the quicker boarding and disembarking will be and the 
less chance there is of opening or closing a latch that another hand has touched. Easa says airlines should 
encourage checking in luggage "by implementing incentive policies".
The pre-pandemic incentive policies went the other way: for many airlines, the more luggage you checked in, the 
more you paid. Are they really going to reverse this? I asked easyJet whether it intended to eliminate or reduce its 
checked baggage charges, which go up to £37.49 for a 23kg bag. EasyJet said it had no current plans to reduce 
hold luggage charges but would "review" the situation regularly.
Under Easa's plans, there will no longer be duty-free sales on board. Inflight food should be pre-packed and sealed 
and drinks should be in cans. Passengers should wear face masks from the moment they enter the airport and 
throughout the flight. If you're on a longhaul flight you should bring enough masks to change them every four hours. 
If any passenger shows signs after takeoff of Covid-19, including "fever, persistent cough, vomiting, diarrhoea, 
difficulty breathing or other flu-like symptoms", they should be isolated on board, with two empty rows in each 
direction if possible, and the closest toilet reserved for the sick passenger.
When will we fly again? Airlines are rushing to put planes in the skies but passengers are reluctant to board. 
From social distancing to luggage rules, Michael ....
The whole toilet situation sounds pretty fraught. Even if there are no symptomatic passengers on board, Easa say 
that one toilet should be reserved for the crew. Airlines should not allow queues for the others. Ryanair says 
passengers will have to ask for permission to go to the loo.
None of this sounds much fun, and the airlines, understandably, are keen to assure us that the chances of 
contracting Covid-19 on a flight are low. The International Air Transport Association's medical director said there 
was sparse evidence that a coronavirus-afflicted passenger could infect others on board. A flight from the US to 
Taiwan at the end of March that subsequently turned out to have had 12 symptomatic passengers caused no 
problems for the other 328 passengers and crew members who all tested negative. An informal survey of 18 large 
airlines identified, from January to March, just three cases of in-flight transmission of coronavirus, all from 
passengers to crew, and four cases of pilot to pilot infection, which could have taken place during the flight or 
before or after it.
There were no cases of passenger to passenger transmission on these flights, which was also confirmed in 
information Iata requested from 70 airlines representing half of global traffic. The only suspected case of large-scale 
in-flight infection was on a flight from the UK to Vietnam in early March in which one passenger was thought to have 
infected 14 others, 12 of whom were sitting nearby. Iata said a formal study into this flight was expected to take 
place.
It helps, Iata said, that passengers all face the same direction, that they are protected from those in front and 
behind by seat backs, that cabin air flow is from ceiling to floor and that modern planes have high efficiency 
particulate air (Hepa) filters that are effective at trapping viruses.
Will this be enough to persuade millions to fly? Possibly not at first. That will probably take a worldwide vaccination 
programme or widespread immunity through past infection, and we are a long way from that. As Iata concedes, the 
numbers who have had the disease are still low - and we don't know how long immunity lasts. But the queues of 
people prepared to enter shops after a long lockdown suggest many are itching to get back to normal. If the price is 
right this summer, a fair number may want to get away. But for now, flying looks like an activity for the young and 
less vulnerable - or the reckless and the brave.

B ring on summer," said American Airlines as it announced plans to restart more than 55 per cent of its domestic 
flights in July. Ryanair is offering one-way tickets for as little as (EURO)19.99 as it aims to restore 40 per cent of its 
services next month.
The airlines are rushing to put more aircraft into the skies, but are the passengers ready to fly? Not really. In the 
UK, 81 per cent of people surveyed in May said that they had no plans to travel outside the country in the next four 
months, according to UBS Evidence Lab, the bank's data arm, which has been tracking consumers' intentions.
Even in countries where coronavirus infections are under tighter control, people are reluctant to head for the airport. 
In South Korea, more than 80 per cent said in April that they had no travel plans, although a survey in May showed 
this had fallen to 70 per cent and the number prepared to travel outside europe had gone up from 6 per cent to 11 
per cent.
Some passengers who flew in the past few weeks have found the experience strange but not too stressful, if only 
because they had the airport and aircraft almost to themselves. One traveller who took an American Airlines flight 
from San Jose to Dallas Fort Worth airport and then to London's Heathrow in late May told me his overwhelming 
impression was of the emptiness of the facilities. He saw only two other passengers on the inter-terminal train at 
DFW - and they were airport staff.
When will we fly again? Airlines are rushing to put planes in the skies but passengers are reluctant to board. 
From social distancing to luggage rules, Michael ....
The traveller said the unharried check-in clerk was behind Plexiglas. There were hand-sanitiser stations dotted 
through the building. There were no queues to get through security and no problems with social distancing at the 
gate - because hardly anyone was boarding his flight. There was no question of having to sit next to another 
passenger: there were so few on board that when, after settling into his window seat, someone else sat on the 
aisle, cabin crew moved him to a three-seat row of his own. Queues for the toilets? There weren't any.
