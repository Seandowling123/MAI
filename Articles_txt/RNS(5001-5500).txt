Ryanair Holdings PLC
27 April 2007
          MARTIN CULLEN PUTS SEMI STATE PROFITS BEFORE PASSENGER NEEDS
Ryanair, today (Friday, 27th April 2007) condemned Transport Minister Martin
Cullen - the Minister for electronic voting machines - who last week subverted
the independence of the Aviation Regulator by sending him a letter instructing
him to double passenger charges at Dublin Airport, and prioritise DAA profits
over passenger needs.
Ryanair called on Minister Cullen and Bertie Ahern's Government to put passenger
needs before semi-state profits, by delivering the independent, competing second
terminal which was promised by this Government in its 2002 "Agreed Programme for
Government".
As a result of this Government's failure to deliver an independent second
terminal, the DAA monopoly now plans to waste EUR800m building a second terminal
which could and should be built for less than EUR200m. The Aviation Regulator has
Ryanair Holdings PLC Cullen puts profits first
confirmed that if these plans proceed, passenger charges at Dublin Airport will
double. Now Minister Cullen has again subverted the independence of the Aviation
Regulator's office by instructing him to set charges which prioritise the
profitability of Dublin Airport over the needs of the travelling public. In
effect, Minister Cullen has now ordered the Aviation Regulator to double
passenger charges at Dublin Airport.
Calling on Martin Cullen and this Government to honour their promise to deliver
an independent competing second terminal, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
"This is typical of this Minister and this Government. First they waste EUR50m on
electronic voting machines that don't work, now they allow the Dublin Airport
Authority (who manage one of the worst airports in Europe) to build a second
terminal which costs between four and eight times more than similar terminals
elsewhere in Europe.
"As usual this Minister and this Government's solution is to force the public to
pay for their mistakes. Passenger charges at Dublin Airport will double if the
DAA monopoly's EUR800m plans go ahead.
"Having appointed an independent Aviation Regulator, this Minister has now
instructed him to double charges at Dublin Airport because semi-state profits
matter more than passenger needs. Competition can fix the shambles at Dublin
Airport by improving services and reducing costs. Martin Cullen and the DAA's
only solution is to double passenger charges.
"This latest instruction from Martin Cullen to double passenger charges at
Dublin Airport again proves that we can't trust this Government on transport."

26 April 2007
                          7 NEW ROUTES FOR BREMEN BASE
              ALGHERO, BRATISLAVA, MALTA, MILAN, PARIS, STOCKHOLM
                                   & TRAPANI
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-fare airline, today (Thursday, 26th April 2007)
announced 7 new routes from its Bremen base to Alghero (Sardinia), Bratislava,
Malta, Milan, Paris, Stockholm and Trapani (Sicily), bringing Ryanair's total
routes from Bremen to 18.
These 7 new routes will start in September, when Ryanair will add a third brand
new Boeing 737-800 to the base, bringing the airline's total investment in
Bremen to over $220M.
Announcing the 7 new routes, Sean Coyle, Ryanair's Director of Scheduled Revenue
said:
        "Ryanair's Bremen base has been a tremendous success from day one and
         our EUR220M investment in the airport will deliver over 1 million
         passengers in the coming year, sustaining 1,000 jobs and generating a
Ryanair Holdings PLC 7 NEW ROUTES FOR BREMEN
         visitor spend of over EUR150M. Today's package of 7 additional routes
         means even more choice and even more low fares for German consumers who
         want to escape from the high fares and fuel surcharges of Lufthansa.
        "To celebrate these 7 new routes, we are offering 5 million seats across
         Europe for just EUR10 * and we advise passengers to log onto
         www.ryanair.com immediately, as demand for bargain seats to Europe's hot
         spots will be very strong".

                US DOT CONFIRMS RYANAIR IS NO 1 FOR PUNCTUALITY
            WORLD'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE IS WORLD'S MOST PUNCTUAL TOO!
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline today, (Wednesday, 25th April 2007)
welcomed the release of US Department of Transport statistics which confirm that
Ryanair is the world's most punctual major airline, with more on-time flights in
2006 than its counterparts in both the EU and the US.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard, said:
        "Ryanair is the world's favourite airline. We offer the lowest fares, we
         carry more international passengers and we are also the world's most
         punctual airline! These US DOT statistics confirm that Ryanair is No. 1
         for on-time flights, beating the major carriers in both Europe AND the
         United States.
        "This year 50 million passengers will choose Ryanair, because we offer
         the lowest fares, we lose the fewest bags, but we also have the world's
         best punctuality".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
30 March 2007
                         RYANAIR WELCOMES OFT DECISION
                TO REFER BAA MONOPOLY TO COMPETITION COMMISSION
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Friday, 30th March 2007)
welcomed the UK Office of Fair Trading's decision to refer the BAA monopoly to
the Competition Commission.
The BAA monopoly should now be broken up to allow competition, improved
services, lower airport costs and the development of sensible cost efficient
facilities where the current BAA monopoly and ineffective regulator (the CAA)
have clearly failed.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "This referral is good news for consumers. Ryanair has long called on
         the CAA to take action to end monopoly abuse by the BAA, which has
         resulted in inadequate facilities and excessive passenger charges at the
         London airports in particular. Let's face it, Heathrow is a mess,
         passengers continue to be stuck in long security queues at Stansted and
         Gatwick's development is being held back by this over charging monopoly.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcomes OFT Decision
        "At a time when users in Stansted unanimously oppose the wasting of GBP4bn
         on a second terminal and runway which could be built for less than GBP1bn,
         the BAA monopoly intends to ignore its users' requirements and push
         through this gold plated Taj Mahal anyway, which would double passenger
         charges at Stansted.
        "Ryanair calls on the Competition Commission to break up the BAA airport
         monopoly which has failed over 20 years to meet the needs of passengers.
         By spinning out Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted into separately owned
         companies, which are then forced to compete against each other, improved
         terminal facilities and lower cost terminal and car parking charges will
         evolve in much the same way that competition between the airlines - led
         by Ryanair - has lowered air fares and delivered enormous growth at the
         UK airports.
        "Regulation by the CAA has clearly failed, it's time to allow
         competition between the London airports to deliver better facilities and
         lower costs for British passengers and British business".
Ends.            Friday, 30th March 2007

Ryanair Holdings PLC
30 March 2007
 RYANAIR DESCRIBES LEAKED EU FINDING AS BIZARRE, UNPRECEDENTED AND POLITICALLY
                                    MOTIVATED
Following the leak of confidential material to a media source in Brussels,
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Friday, 30th March 2007)
seriously questioned the European Commission's latest comments on its Aer Lingus
bid. The airline also criticised the leaking of this confidential report to the
media. Ryanair stated that these findings run contrary to the European
Commission's stated policy of supporting airline consolidation, are not
supported by evidence, and are bizarre from a Commission which has previously
approved mergers between Air France and KLM, Lufthansa and Austrian, and
Lufthansa and Swiss Airlines. These findings fly in the face of these EU airline
precedents, and are clearly designed to appease the political interests of the
Irish Government, rather than advancing the interests of Irish consumers and
Ryanair Holdings PLC LEAKED EU FINDING BIZARRE
visitors.
Ryanair said that the EU's findings which suggested that a merger between Aer
Lingus and Ryanair "is likely to significantly impede effective competition" are
unsupported by the facts in this case which include Ryanair's commitments to;
1. Reduce Aer Lingus's fares each year for a four year period.
2. Reduce Aer Lingus's fuel surcharges.
3. Improve Aer Lingus's fleet and product.
4. Significantly reduce Aer Lingus's cost base.
Ryanair firmly believes that the measures proposed for Aer Lingus will generate
substantial savings which will be passed on to consumers, because they will lead
to reduced prices, improved services, as well as providing Aer Lingus with a
strong financial partner. No such commitments were given in the far larger Air
France-KLM takeover which was approved by the Commission and has since seen
large fare increases and fuel surcharges. At a time of increasing EU airline
takeovers and consolidations, these bizarre findings fly in the face of all
precedent decisions in the European airline industry and also run counter to the
inevitable wave of further consolidations which EU-US Open Skies will bring
about.
Ryanair's Spokesman, Peter Sherrard, today said:
    "These findings by the European Commission are clearly politically
     motivated. It is untenable for DG Competition - which has previously
     approved the EUR3.8bn Air France takeover of KLM, and the Lufthansa takeovers
     of Swiss and Austrian Airlines - to suggest that the much smaller Ryanair
     takeover of Aer Lingus will impede effective competition, when Ryanair has
     already offered to guarantee fare reductions, fuel surcharge reductions and
     improved services. These findings also fly in the face of the wave of
     national consolidations which have and continue to take place across Europe
     and have seen:
     a. Ryanair previously acquire Buzz in the UK.
      b. SN Airlines acquire Virgin Express in Belgium.
      c. Air Berlin buy Deutsche BA in Germany.
      d. BA dispose of BA Connect to FlyBe in the UK.
      e. Air Berlin buy LTU in Germany.
      f. Tap buy Portugalia in Portugal.
    "At a time when British Airways is considering purchasing BMI, when Iberia
     is the subject of takeover approaches from British Airways, Air France and
     Lufthansa, when Alitalia is the subject of takeover approaches by Lufthansa
     and Air France, the suggestion that two Irish airlines - which combined,
     account for less than 5% of EU air travel - should not be allowed to merge
     is a bizarre and clearly political, rather than a competition position.
Ryanair Holdings PLC LEAKED EU FINDING BIZARRE
    "It is clear that the EU Competition Commission is applying a different and
     unique standard to the Ryanair-Aer Lingus offer which flies in the face of
     all previous decisions and runs contrary to the wave of mergers and
     takeovers which is now in train following EU-US Open Skies. EU-US Open Skies
     opens both Ryanair and Aer Lingus to the possibility of far more intense
     competition at Dublin from major American airlines. Aer Lingus needs to find
     a strong financial partner if it is to compete effectively against the US
     and European mega carriers. Ryanair can provide that strong financial
     partner, at a time when Aer Lingus has withdrawn from BA's One World
     Alliance.
    "It is unfair of the European Commission to apply different rules and a
     different standard to Ryanair's merger with Aer Lingus than it previously
     applied in the larger Air France or Lufthansa mergers. How can the European
     Commission subsequently approve takeovers of Iberia or Alitalia, when it
     makes what is clearly a politically motivated decision to block Ryanair's
     much smaller offer for Aer Lingus? It appears that yet again the European
     Commission has one set of rules for flag carrier airlines, and a different,
     unique set of rules for efficient low fare airlines like Ryanair. We call on
     the European Commission to stop this politically motivated interference in
     the Ryanair-Aer Lingus offer, and apply its own competition rules fairly.
     This merger should be approved without further delay or interference, as
     part of the continuing wave of European airline consolidation".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
26 March 2007
 INEFFECTIVE AVIATION REGULATOR APPROVES FURTHER UNNECESSARY PRICE INCREASES ON
                                    PASSENGERS
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline today (Monday, 26th March 2007) criticised
the ineffective Aviation Regulator for his decision to permit the Irish Aviation
Authority to jack up Air Traffic Control fees by an estimated 12% plus inflation
over the next 5 years. This further increase in passenger costs will damage
Irish tourism and make Ireland a more expensive destination for overseas
visitors.
Ryanair criticised this latest price increase approved by the Aviation Regulator
on a number of grounds as follows:
 1. There has been no real consultation between the IAA and the user airlines
     who must pay for its services.
 2. The Aviation Regulator has largely ignored the submissions of the main
     airlines, including Ryanair, Aer Lingus and others.
 3. These high ATC costs will be further increased with new and unnecessary Air
     Traffic Control towers at Cork and Dublin airports. The existing ATC tower
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aviation Reg appr increases
     at Dublin is less than 10 years old, it does not require replacement.
 4. These two new ATC towers are more gold-plating, which like the new terminal
     at Cork Airport, are not necessary. They are designed to boost capital
     expenditure and increase passenger charges so that the regulated monopoly
     (in this case the IAA) can jack up its income for the foreseeable future.
Responding today to these latest price increases from the Aviation Regulator,
Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
    "The system of aviation regulation in Ireland is worse than useless. Like
     all the other ineffective regulators in this country, the Aviation Regulator
     has again signed off on unnecessary facilities and rewarded an inefficient
     state monopoly with big price increases while ignoring the views and inputs
     of the users who will have to pay for this regulatory failure. Given the
     enormous increase in traffic which lower fares are delivering in Ireland at
     present, the cost per passenger should be falling, not rising. The Aviation
     Regulator is allowing both the airport and the ATC monopolies to build
     unnecessary gold-plated facilities and to pay for these with inflation
     busting price increases.
    "These latest prices increases from this failed Aviation Regulator shows yet
     again that regulation doesn't work. The Office of Fair Trade in the UK is
     presently considering whether the BAA airport monopoly should be broken up
     because of the failure of the CAA's regulatory regime in the UK. It is time
     we had a similar review by the Competition Authority in Ireland, because the
     Aviation Regulator's office has yet again failed to protect the reasonable
     interests of users. Aviation users in Ireland want efficient facilities and
     lower costs, not gold-plated terminals, shiny new ATC towers and inflation
     busting price increases".

                 RYANAIR WELCOMES OPENSKIES - IT'S ABOUT TIME!
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 22nd March 2007)
welcomed the introduction of Open Skies between the EU and the US. As Ryanair
has successfully proved in Europe, the liberalisation of air transport delivers
increased competition, better choice and lower airfares for consumers.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair welcomes this Open Skies agreement because Irish passengers
         will now enjoy greater choice and lower airfares on transatlantic
         routes. For years, prices have been too high on these routes because of
         Government controlled bi-lateral agreements.
        "Ryanair calls on the EU to use this opportunity to apply the benefits
         of deregulation to airports too. In Ireland, consumers are still paying
         for an absence of competition in this sector, which is bedevilled by
         protected monopoly airports.
        "Real competition would put an end to the Dublin Airport Monopoly's
         plans to make passengers pay for a EUR750m 'Taj Mahal' second terminal
         when similar sized terminals are being built elsewhere in Europe for a
         tenth of the price. If passengers are enjoying the benefits of
         competition between airlines, then surely they deserve an end to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Wecomes Openskies
         Government protected airport monopolies too".

  profitability was significantly improved driven by cost reduction and
 revenue gains.   The  UK and  Netherlands cargo  businesses  remained
 broadly flat despite weaker volumes and  the loss of Emirates in  the
 UK.
We made  three  acquisitions  :-  Malmo  Main  Air  Cargo  AB,  which
 establishes our first presence  in Scandinavia;   Top Service SRL,  a
 passenger services provider at  Romania's second airport,  Timisoara;
 and  Express  Baggage  (Heathrow)  Limited,  a  provider  of  luggage
 repatriation services to major airlines at Heathrow and five regional
 locations across the UK.   These acquisitions have been  successfully
 integrated and trading has been in line with our expectations.
We have expanded geographically, particularly in Spain, where in a
joint venture with Ferrovial, we have won ground handling licences at
six airports and have secured a number of important contracts
including Ryanair, easyJet and Lufthansa.
Americas
 We made significant  progress in our  underlying USA ground  handling
 business and it exited 2006 in profit.  Our Mexico business recovered
 more  quickly  from  the  2005  hurricane  than  anticipated.    Peru
 benefited from strong  cargo volumes  and we closed  our loss  making
 Brazil and Panama businesses during the year.
We completed three acquisitions during the year :- Aeroground Inc,  a
 cargo handler  at  nine  airports  across  North  America;  Catamount
 Holdings LLC, a Chicago based  cargo handler; and Integrated  Airline
 Services Alliance  LLC,  an  east  coast  USA  ground  handler  which
 specialises in low cost airlines.  Trading has been in line with  our
Menzies(John) PLC Preliminary Results -2-
 expectations  and  these  businesses  are  also  being   successfully
 integrated with our existing business.
Asia Pacific
In our underlying business we secured a multi station contract in
Australia with Thai Airways, covering ground and cargo handling.
Hong Kong made strong progress helped by contract wins.
We made two acquisitions in Australia during 2006 :- Perth Cargo
Centre Pty Limited, a cargo handling business; and Australian
Airsupport Pty Limited, a ground handling business in Brisbane.
Together with our existing businesses in Melbourne and Sydney, we now
have operations in each of the four key Australian gateways.
We secured two exclusive ten  year joint venture contracts for  cargo
 handling at the new Hyderabad and Bangalore airports which are  being
 built as  part of  India's airport  renewal programme.     These  are
 scheduled to commence operations in 2008.

 Underlying operating profit[2]      23.7      30.7         (23%)
Performance in 2006
 Revenue was up 4%  mainly due to acquisitions.   Like for like  (lfl)
 sales[6] were  down  1%  reflecting  the  tougher  sales  environment
 particularly for monthly magazines and partworks.  Lfl magazine sales
 fell by 3% while lfl newspaper sales were up 1%.
We are  seeing  structural  changes  in  the  magazine  sector.    As
 broadband penetration  increases  and on-line  content  becomes  more
 sophisticated, consumers are spending more  time on the internet  and
 less time on printed media. We believe this contributed significantly
 to a 7%  drop in  lfl sales of  monthly magazines.   Partwork  sales,
 which peaked in  2004, have now  returned to 2002  sales levels.   In
 2006 lfl partwork  sales fell  by 35%.   Although  gross profit  from
 weekly magazine  sales  was  flat,  lfl sales  rose  by  3%  as  some
 consumers moved from monthly to weekly titles.
Newspapers volumes continued their steady decline but this reduction
was offset by a number of price increases, particularly on Sunday
titles.
The contract  renewal process  for magazines  and newspapers  is  now
 substantially complete and we are  pleased that we have secured  this
 business on five year contracts.   As anticipated, this has  resulted
 in some margin reduction.
Stickers performed well  due to  World Cup  2006 and  the Doctor  Who
 collection with lfl  sales rising  by 64%.   With  no major  football
 tournament occurring, we  do not  expect this  level of  sales to  be
 maintained in 2007.
Menzies(John) PLC Preliminary Results -2-
Underlying  operating  profit[2]  for   the  division  fell  by   23%
 reflecting the  significant drop  in  monthly magazine  and  partwork
 sales  and  the   margin  reduction  from   contract  renewals   with
 publishers.
Acquisitions and joint ventures
 Menzies Distribution acquired two independent newspaper and  magazine
 wholesalers  during  the   year  -   Chester  Independent   Wholesale
 Newsagents Limited  and  North  West Wholesale  News  Limited.    The
 operational  integration   of  these   businesses  was   successfully
 completed during 2006 and this has reinforced our position as the No2
 in the marketplace.
Just before the year end we entered into a conditional joint  venture
 agreement with  Eason &  Son  Ltd (Eason).  The  deal is  subject  to
 certain regulatory and other approvals.   The joint venture will  see
 Menzies and Eason combine  their newspaper and magazine  distribution
 businesses in  Northern Ireland  and  the Republic  of Ireland.    We
 expect the  venture to  start during  April in  Northern Ireland  and
 September in the Republic of Ireland.

Cost initiatives
We have invested in our cost reduction programme during the year and
this helped deliver cost savings in real terms of GBP2.7m during 2006,
up from GBP1.1m in 2005. This programme has concentrated on 3 areas:
1) Shop floor productivity
 New magazine  packing  systems  have  been  installed  at  our  York,
 Chester,  Leeds,  Dundee   and  Cambuslang  branches   and  we   have
 successfully trialled  new equipment  for processing  returns at  our
 Dundee branch.
Our continuous process improvement (CPI) programme has been an
important tool for management in seeking further efficiencies in the
cost base, aiding the delivery of significant cost savings in 2006.
2) Centralisation of functions
We have set up a new regional contact centre in Sheffield which
covers almost 6,000 customers and has delivered significant cost
savings.
Following the development of a new integrated system 'i-Mag', we have
 successfully  centralised  our  magazine  allocation  function   from
 branches into the  Edinburgh Head  Office.  This  has delivered  cost
 efficiencies  and,  through  better  controls,  has  led  to   higher
 compliance with customer service metrics.
3) Branch network reconfiguration
 The  new  magazine  packing  systems  have  enabled  us  to   further
Menzies(John) PLC Preliminary Results -2-
 re-engineer our branch configuration and  extend our 'hub and  spoke'
 network, whereby the smaller 'spoke' branches only perform  newspaper
 packing with  magazine  packing  managed  from  the  larger  'hub'.
 Successful 'hub/spoke' implementations comprised  Cambuslang/Dumfries
 and Chester/Preston.
Office of Fair Trading
The OFT has recently announced that there will be a further delay to
issuing a final opinion on a framework for assessing how newspaper
and magazine agreements comply with competition law. During 2006, we
significantly strengthened our position as the No2 player in the
market and remain confident that we can meet the changing service
requirements of the industry.
Current trading and outlook
Menzies Aviation
We are trading ahead of last year despite the continuing softness in
cargo volumes and the weaker US dollar. We expect to see further
growth in 2007.
We have won a number of contracts since the year end, most notably
British Airways ground and cargo handling in Sydney; Virgin cargo
handling in Chicago; Lufthansa ground handling in Houston and easyJet
ground handling at London Gatwick, Glasgow and East Midlands.
Our joint venture to handle cargo at the new Hyderabad and Bangalore
airports in India remains on track, and operations are scheduled to
commence in 2008.
We continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by
tailoring our products to meet customer needs, delivering consistent
levels of service, providing innovative IT solutions and investing in
infrastructure to underpin growth and profitability.
Menzies Distribution
There are some signs of stability in the market and both newspaper
and magazine revenues have been flat in the first 10 weeks of 2007.
As previously indicated, we have accelerated cost saving initiatives
Menzies(John) PLC Preliminary Results -2-
and we expect to deliver further cost savings in real terms in excess
of GBP3m in 2007.
Group
 We expect the  Group to trade  in line with  our expectations  during
 2007.   As the  Group  continues to  move  towards the  higher  rated
 aviation services market, we believe  we are well placed to  increase
 shareholder value.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
08 March 2007
                          RYANAIR OPPOSED TO EUR609M T2
                 AND DOUBLING PASSENGER CHARGES AT DUBLIN AIRPORT
Ryanair, Dublin Airport's largest airline user today (Thursday, 8th March 2007)
confirmed that it will continue to oppose the gold plated EUR609m second terminal
(T2) (EUR760m with the redundancy of the EUR150m Pier C) proposed by the DAA
monopoly at Dublin Airport - because it costs 10 times more than similar sized
facilities being provided at other airports in Europe and will lead to passenger
charges doubling at Dublin Airport.
The DAA monopoly should not be allowed to waste EUR609m building a 15m passenger
facility when Frankfurt Hahn can build a similar 15m passenger terminal for just
EUR60m - less than one tenth the cost of the proposed T2 Taj Mahal at Dublin
Airport. As a result of this 10 times more expensive building at Dublin and
other wasteful spending, the Aviation Regulator has indicated that passenger
Ryanair Holdings PLC Opposed to EUR 609M T2
fees at Dublin will double from a current EUR5.50 to around EUR11.00.
There would be no need for any increase in passenger charges at Dublin Airport
if the DAA built a low cost efficient terminal, which is what its major airline
users have already confirmed that they want to see developed. At a time when Aer
Lingus, for example, is trying to reduce unit costs, the DAA is proposing to
double them at Dublin Airport.
If a competing second terminal was being developed by Ryanair, the McEvaddy's,
or any of the other 13 parties who offered to do so, then there would be no
increase in passenger charges. In fact competition between an independent
terminal and the DAA would reduce these high passenger charges and improve the
awful facilities at Dublin Airport.
Speaking today Ryanair, Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
        "It is vital that the mess which the DAA have created at Cork Airport is
         not repeated at Dublin. In Cork, the DAA wasted EUR200m building a new
         terminal for just 3m passengers. This was 10 times more than the EUR20m
         which Cork's terminal should have cost. Now Cork Airport is stuck with a
         EUR200m debt, which it can never repay.
        "Cork airport's terminal proves yet again that the DAA monopoly cannot
         be trusted to build cost efficient terminal facilities. It also proves
         that the Aviation Regulator is hopelessly unable to control the DAA
         monopoly. He's just a poodle, who rolls over every time the DAA wants to
         put up charges.
        "Ryanair supports, and will happily pay for low cost, efficient
         facilities. We have already offered to build and pay for an independent
         second terminal at Dublin Airport. The fact that a 15m passenger
         terminal can be built in Frankfurt for EUR60m, proves that we are right
         and we will continue to oppose the DAA spending over ten times this
         amount - EUR609m - on a similar 15m passenger facility. We must prevent
         the DAA repeating its Cork Airport mess at Dublin. We must prevent the
         DAA monopoly (and the weak Aviation Regulator) from doubling charges for
         all consumers using Dublin Airport, when, if an efficient terminal was
         built or built by someone other than the DAA monopoly, then tourism
         traffic would continue to grow, but with lower airport charges and low
         fares for all Irish consumers and visitors".

 offeree;
              (b)   is an associated company of the offeror, of the offeree or of an associate of the 
offeror or of the
 offeree described in (a) (for this purpose ownership or control of 20% or more

provided that,
 in case of an adviser which is a partnership, only those partners and professional staff who are actively 
engaged in
 relation to the offer or who are customarily engaged in the affairs of the relevant client or who have 
been engaged in
 those affairs within the period of two years prior to the commencement of the relative offer period shall 
be deemed to
 be associates of the offeror or the offeree (as the case
                     may be);
              (e)   is a person controlling, controlled by, or under the same control as*, an associate of 
the offeror
 or offeree described in (d);
              (f)   Is (i) a director of the offeror, the offeree or any associate of the offeror or the 
offeree
 described in (a), (b) or (c); (ii) the spouse, parent, brother, sister or child of such a director; (iii)

 a trust (including a discretionary trust) of which such a director or any spouse, parent, brother, sister 
or child of
 such a director is a beneficiary or potential beneficiary; or (iv) a company controlled by one or more of

offeror, the
 offeree or any associate of the offeror or the offeree described in (a), (b) or (c) participates;

                      RYANAIR APPLIES FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW
                OF REGULATOR'S DECISION ON SLOTS AT DUBLIN AIRPORT
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Monday, 5th March 2007)
confirmed that it had applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the
Commission for Aviation Regulation's (CAR's) recent decision to needlessly
impose full slot coordination at Dublin Airport. This is the second time that
Ryanair has been forced to resort to the courts to prevent this Regulator from
limiting growth and promoting inefficiency at Dublin Airport. By needlessly
imposing coordination at Dublin Airport, the Regulator is allowing the monopoly
airport operator to restrict capacity and increase prices. This is exactly what
this Regulator is supposed to prevent.
Last year, Ryanair had a similar decision by the CAR overturned by the High
Court where the Court found that the CAR had failed to follow the required steps
Ryanair Holdings PLC Judicial Review-Airport Slots
proscribed by the European Regulation on slot coordination. Dublin Airport is an
airport with two runways catering for just 20 million passengers per annum and
there is ample room for growth. By contrast, Gatwick Airport has just one runway
and caters for twice as many passengers - almost 40 million.
Commenting today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
    "This is a further indication that the CAR is not serious about regulating
     the Dublin Airport monopoly. The fact that Dublin Airport already has two
     runways and is only handling 20 million passengers per annum whereas Gatwick
     is handling 40 million on one runway makes this latest decision a complete
     nonsense.
    "DAA and its predecessor, Aer Rianta, have been attempting for the past 7
     years to get full coordination at Dublin Airport because it restricts
     capacity so that they can build further gold plated facilities and massively
     increase prices for consumers. Prices in Dublin Airport are set to double if
     the DAA is allowed to pursue its EUR2 billion investment and sadly this
     ineffective Regulator shows no appetite for regulating this inefficient,
     high cost monopoly. Airlines are either ignored or forced to resort to legal
     action.
    "The mess in Cork airport and the DAA's plans to waste another EUR750 million
     white elephant second terminal in Dublin are clear indications that airport
     regulation has failed in Ireland."
Ends.                                                     Monday, 5th March 2007

Ryanair Holdings plc announces that following today's decision of the European
Commission to refer the acquisition of Aer Lingus to Phase II, Ryanair's Offer
lapses, in accordance with the requirements of the Takeover Rules, with
immediate effect and all acceptances of the Offer received to date are void.
Ryanair also announces that in the event of European Commission clearance
following its Phase II review, Ryanair intends to make a further offer for Aer
Lingus ("Further Offer"). The making of any such Further Offer would require
consent of the Panel to a derogation from the prohibition on making a further
offer within twelve months after the date on which the original Offer lapsed.
The Takeover Rules Notes specifically provide that the Panel may grant its
consent in circumstances where a previous offer has lapsed as a result of a

Commission a new offer is made within 21 days of such decision.
Ryanair will make further announcements when appropriate.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES OFT DECISION TO REFER BAA AIRPORT MONOPOLY TO THE COMPETITION
                                    COMMISSION
                   AND CALLS FOR BREAK-UP OF THE BAA MONOPOLY
Ryanair Europe's largest low fares airline this morning (Tuesday, 12th December
2006) welcomed the pro-consumer decision by the OFT to refer the BAA airport
monopoly to the Competition Commission, and called on the Competition Commission
to recommend the break-up of the BAA monopoly, which has led to high prices and
abject services at London's three main airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted.
Welcoming this morning's decision, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary,
said:
        "Ryanair has long called for a break-up of the BAA monopoly. Heathrow is
         a shambles, which most passengers if they could, would avoid at all
         costs. Equally, Stansted where we operate is an over-specified, gold
         plated Taj Mahal. The present ineffective regulatory regime operated by
         the CAA encourages the BAA monopoly to waste GBP4bn. building a second
         runway and terminal at Stansted, when these facilities could easily be
         built for less than one quarter of this figure.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcomes OFT Decision re BAA
        "The competition between Liverpool and Manchester airports has led to
         reduced charges and improved services for passengers. Equally, in
         Scotland, the competition between Glasgow Prestwick and Glasgow Paisley
         has led to lower charges and choice for consumers.
        "Competition works. It leads to more choice and better services for
         consumers. We again call for the break up of the BAA monopoly. Heathrow,
         Gatwick and Stansted should be spun out into separately owned,
         independent, competing airports, where the market and airport users will
         have more influence over the type of low cost, efficient facilities that
         are provided, and so we finally do away with the era of gold plated Taj
         Mahal palaces and high prices favoured by the BAA monopoly".
Ends.                                                Tuesday, 12th December 2006

BAA PLC
12 December 2006
                  BAA response to Office of Fair Trading study
BAA today responded to the Office of Fair Trading's (OFT) market study on the
UK Airports industry which has called for a more detailed investigation by the
Competition Commission into the supply of airport services.
Stephen Nelson, Chief Executive of BAA said:
"As the operator of the UK's three largest airports, Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted, it is right that BAA's ownership is subject to regular public
scrutiny. Our belief is that BAA's structure has benefited both passengers and
airlines and BAA has not abused its monopoly.
"The main issue facing the UK is a lack of terminal and runway capacity in the
South East of England which results in delay and congestion. This problem has
not arisen because of BAA's structure, but instead is the result of the UK's
complex planning laws, an antiquated regulatory system and inflexible slot
BAA PLC Response to OFT study
allocation. Lack of capacity is a complex issue therefore it would be wrong to
jump to quick and simplistic conclusions about structure.
"BAA has both expertise and a strong track record in delivering new airport
facilities and our plans to invest GBP9.5 billion over the next ten years at
Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted will transform the passenger experience. Our
investment in new airport facilities, together with world leading runway
productivity, has helped create the most vibrant air transport market in
Europe, great choice in destinations, low prices for passengers and some of the
most profitable airlines in the world.
Stephen Nelson, concludes: "I fully understand why airlines like British
Airways and Ryanair want to weaken BAA and achieve greater control over prices
and investment at the airports they dominate. This should not be confused with
acting in the passenger interest."

Aer Lingus Group PLC
01 December 2006
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             For Immediate Release
              AER LINGUS GROUP PLC POSTS SECOND RESPONSE CIRCULAR
            Aer Lingus Shareholders advised to Reject Ryanair Offer
Aer Lingus announces today that it is posting its second response circular,
which explains why the Participating Directors continue to believe that the
Ryanair Offer is wholly unattractive, and unanimously recommend that Aer Lingus
shareholders take no action in relation to the Offer.
In the second response circular, the Participating Directors emphasise:
o        Aer Lingus' commitment to continue to reduce unit costs;
o        Aer Lingus' excellent prospects as an independent company;
o        Aer Lingus' proven track record of superior returns;
o        The Offer fails to adequately value Aer Lingus' intrinsic value; and
o        The Offer is conditional on merger clearance.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Second Response Circular
Commenting on the posting of the second response circular, John Sharman,
Chairman of Aer Lingus, said:
"Ryanair's Offer significantly undervalues Aer Lingus. It does not reflect Aer
Lingus' leading brand, excellent growth prospects, sought after slot positions,
significant net cash balance, its valuable aircraft fleet and property assets.
Today we have announced details of our ongoing programme to reduce unit costs
which we believe will deliver significant value for shareholders.
We are well-capitalised, with a strong balance sheet and a management team
delivering some of the best returns in the European aviation industry. An
independent Aer Lingus makes sound business sense. A hostile takeover at a
derisory price which will create a Ryanair monopoly in Ireland does not make
sense. Aer Lingus shareholders should reject the Ryanair Offer."
Dermot Mannion, Chief Executive of Aer Lingus, said:
"Aer Lingus has tremendous opportunities ahead to build on the strong platform
we have put in place. We are currently working with our employees to continue
the aggressive pursuit of business efficiencies which has characterised Aer
Lingus since 2001. We are resolute in rejecting Ryanair's wholly inadequate
offer and planning for long-term competitive growth, servicing one of the most
attractive aviation markets in Europe."
*      Commitment to Unit Cost Reduction
Aer Lingus will continue to focus on cost and productivity as it has since 2001.
Aer Lingus is targeting significant unit cost reductions in twelve key areas
across the organisation, which the Board believes will deliver significant
shareholder value. Aer Lingus employees are being informed about these
initiatives contemporaneously with the publication of the second response
circular. The initiatives will be developed for implementation throughout 2007.
*      Excellent Prospects as an Independent Company
Aer Lingus' short-haul expansion plans are focused on increasing density on
existing routes, it is in prime position for long-haul growth, and it is
strongly placed to reap rewards from ancillary revenue growth.
*      Proven Track Record of Superior Returns
Aer Lingus Group PLC Second Response Circular
Since 2001, Aer Lingus has outperformed its European peer group (ex-Ryanair)
driving returns higher, while Ryanair's returns have fallen. Aer Lingus' returns
are amongst the highest in the European airline sector, which is not reflected
in the multiple that Ryanair is offering. Aer Lingus is committed to sustaining
high levels of return on future investments to deliver increased shareholder
value.
*      The Offer fails to reflect Aer Lingus' Intrinsic Value
The Participating Directors believe that the Offer Price does not adequately
reflect Aer Lingus' numerous valuable assets. The Offer Price does not represent
a strategic premium but, if the Offer is successful, Ryanair will create a
dominant position or de facto monopoly on most short-haul routes to and from
Dublin.
*      The Offer is conditional on Merger Clearance
Ryanair has sought approval for its Offer from the European Commission under the
Merger Regulation. A decision as to whether to refer the Offer to a Phase II
investigation, approve the Offer (with or without conditions) or decline
jurisdiction to consider the Offer will be made by the European Commission by 20
December 2006.
Ryanair has offered the European Commission remedies based on the surrender of
slots to prospective new entrants, including slots at London Heathrow Airport
and elsewhere controlled by Aer Lingus. The Participating Directors believe that
such remedies do not address the issues of overwhelming dominance at Dublin
airport and the elimination of competition between the two low-cost carriers.
The Participating Directors believe that Irish legal and regulatory restrictions
prevent Ryanair from offering any remedies affecting Aer Lingus without the
support of minority shareholders. In addition, there are restrictions on
disposing of the Heathrow slots in Aer Lingus' articles of association, as was
disclosed in the Prospectus, so Ryanair cannot offer Heathrow slots as remedies
if the Minister of Finance and the ESOT do not support the proposals.
The Participating Directors believe that the Ryanair Offer significantly
Aer Lingus Group PLC Second Response Circular
undervalues Aer Lingus and unanimously recommend in the second response circular
that Aer Lingus shareholders take no action in relation to the Offer.
Further details of the information summarised in this announcement are set out
in the second response circular, which is being posted to Aer Lingus
shareholders today, and which is available on the Aer Lingus website,
www.aerlingus.com. Copies of the second response circular are available for
inspection at the offices of Arthur Cox, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, Ireland.
Certain terms used in this announcement, including certain technical and other
terms, are defined and explained in Appendix II (Definitions) and Appendix III
(Glossary of Technical Terms) of the second response circular.

Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 29th November 2006)
welcomed the release of the CAA's market share statistics for January - October

        "These latest statistics from the CAA prove that Ryanair is again the
         passengers' favourite on routes from London. The travelling public keep
         flocking in their droves to Ryanair, because we offer the lowest fares,
         the best punctuality and a no fuel surcharge ever guarantee".

Aer Lingus Group PLC
24 November 2006
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
               CLARIFICATION OF STATEMENTS MADE IN DEFENCE CIRCULAR
The Irish Takeover Panel has ruled that the reference to EBITDAR estimates for
2007 together with the imputed multiple for Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus")
referred to on page 18 of the circular published by Aer Lingus on 3 November
2006 (the "Circular") constituted a profit forecast for the purposes of Rule 28
of the Irish Takeover Rules. The Participating Directors confirm that it was
not their intention that this reference be regarded as a profit forecast and
they are therefore withdrawing it. The intention of the Participating Directors
in including this reference was only to illustrate that the offer made by
Ryanair values Aer Lingus at a significant discount to Ryanair and Aer Lingus'
European peer group.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Clarification of Statements
Date: 24 November 2006
The Participating Directors of Aer Lingus accept responsibility for the
information contained in this announcement. To the best of the knowledge and
belief of the Participating Directors (having taken all reasonable care to
ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this announcement is
in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect its
import. The "Participating Directors" means all of the directors of Aer Lingus
other than Mr Francis Hackett and Mr Michael Johns.
Mr Hackett and Mr Johns are not, for the time being, participating in the
Board's consideration of the Offer and related matters because the Participating
Directors have concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Company
and its shareholders as a whole if, for the time being, the Directors appointed
by the Minister for Transport and the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust
respectively, did not so participate.
Aer Lingus is being advised by Goldman Sachs International, Merrion Stockbrokers
Limited and Goodbody Stockbrokers in relation to the Offer.
Goldman Sachs International, which is authorised and regulated in the United
Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority, is acting exclusively for Aer
Lingus Group plc and no one else in connection with the Offer by Ryanair
Holdings plc and will not be responsible to anyone other than Aer Lingus Group
plc for providing the protections afforded to customers of Goldman Sachs
International or for providing advice in relation to the Offer by Ryanair
Holdings plc or the contents of this announcement.
Merrion Stockbrokers Limited, which is regulated in Ireland by the Financial
Regulator, is acting exclusively for Aer Lingus Group plc and no one else in
connection with the Offer by Ryanair Holdings plc and will not be responsible to
anyone other than Aer Lingus Group plc for providing the protections afforded to
customers of Merrion Stockbrokers Limited or for providing advice in relation to
the Offer by Ryanair Holdings plc or the contents of this announcement.
Goodbody Stockbrokers, which is regulated in Ireland by the Financial Regulator,
Aer Lingus Group PLC Clarification of Statements
is acting exclusively for Aer Lingus Group plc and no one else in connection
with the Offer by Ryanair Holdings plc and will not be responsible to anyone

Offer by Ryanair Holdings plc or the contents of this announcement.
Any person who is the holder of 1 per cent. or more of any class of shares in
Aer Lingus Group plc or Ryanair Holdings plc may be required to make disclosures
pursuant to Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, Takeover Rules 2001
to 2005, as applied, with amendments by the European Communities (Takeover Bids

               RYANAIR SMASHES PASSENGER RECORDS ALL OVER EUROPE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-fares airline today (Thursday, 23rd November 2006)
celebrated a month of significant traffic milestones, as record numbers of
passengers throughout Europe enjoyed its low fares and No. 1 customer service
delivery, while turning their backs on the high fare, fuel surcharging airlines.
During the month of November, the following landmarks have been achieved:
   65M pax will have benefited from Ryanair's lowest fares to and from
     Ireland
    18M Spanish pax saved EUR180M by flying Ryanair instead of Iberia
    Delivering 18M passengers to Frankfurt Hahn
    9M pax have shunned Alitalia's fuel surcharges flying Ryanair to Rome
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard, said:
        "This month Ryanair is celebrating passenger milestones all over Europe,
         as passengers continue to flock to our low fares and top punctuality,
         while abandoning the high fare airlines and their fuel surcharges in
         their droves.
        "To celebrate, we are offering one way flights for as little as EUR10
         each-way, and we advise passengers to get onto www.ryanair.com
Ryanair Holdings PLC Smashes Passenger Records
         immediately, as demand for the lowest fares in Europe continues to be
         huge".
Ends.                                Thursday, 23rd November 2006

may
be) if that person:
              (a)   is the holding company, a subsidiary or a subsidiary of the holding company, of the 
offeror or the
                     offeree;
              (b)   is an associated company of the offeror, of the offeree or of an associate of the 
offeror or of the
                     offeree described in (a) (for this purpose ownership or control of 20% or more
                     of the equity share capital of a company is regarded as the test of associated

company status);

offeror, the
 offeree or such associate, as the case may be, of normal commercial banking services or in such 
activities in connection
 with the offer as confirming that cash is available, handling acceptances and other registration work), 
provided that,
 in case of an adviser which is a partnership, only those partners and professional staff who are actively 
engaged in
 relation to the offer or who are customarily engaged in the affairs of the relevant client or who have 
been engaged in
 those affairs within the period of two years prior to the commencement of the relative offer period shall 
be deemed to
 be associates of the offeror or the offeree (as the case
                     may be);
              (e)   is a person controlling, controlled by, or under the same control as*, an associate of 
the offeror
 or offeree described in (d);

 a trust (including a discretionary trust) of which such a director or any spouse, parent, brother, sister 
or child of
 such a director is a beneficiary or potential beneficiary; or (iv) a company controlled by one or more of 
directors,
 such members of their families and the trustees of all such trusts;
              (g)   is a trustee of any pension scheme (other than an industry-wide scheme) in which the 
offeror, the
 offeree or any associate of the offeror or the offeree described in (a), (b) or (c) participates;

 (h)       is a collective investment scheme or other person the investments of which the offeror or the 
offeree or any
 associate of the offeror or offeree manages on a discretionary basis, in respect of the relevant 
investment accounts;
Michael O' Leary Rule8.1/8.3 Ryanair Holdings
  (i)      owns or controls, or together with one or more other persons acting in concert with him or her 
owns or
 controls, 5% or more of any class of relevant securities (as described in paragraphs (a)
                  to (d) in Rule 8.9) of the offeror or the offeree;
(j)       is a party to an arrangement to which Rule 8.7 applies with any offeror or with an associate of

interest, whether
 commercial, financial or personal, in the outcome of the
                  offer or possible offer concerned.
Paragraphs (a) to (k) are typical cases. Paragraphs (l) above is a category to cover associate status not within
paragraphs (a) to (k)
*Note:     The test for whether a person controls, is controlled by, or is under the same control 
as,another person will
 be by reference to the definition of control contained in the Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997, namely, the 
holding,
 whether directly or indirectly, of securities of the company concerned that confer, in aggregate, not 
less than 30% of
 the voting rights in that company.  If in doubt, consult the Panel.

Aer Lingus Group PLC
16 November 2006
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                        CLARIFICATION OF STATEMENTS MADE
In relation to the offer made by Ryanair on 23 October 2006 for whole of the
issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc not already owned
by Ryanair (the "Offer"), the Participating Directors wish to clarify that
certain remarks made by Mr. Mannion to the media on 3 November 2006 in relation
to Aer Lingus not approving a Ryanair bid or any other offer for Aer Lingus were
made only in respect of the Offer. The Participating Directors are only able to
consider formal proposals when made and at that time will take such action as is
in the best interests of the Company.
This clarification is being made at the request of the Irish Takeover Panel
Aer Lingus Group PLC Clarification re: statements
following a determination by it that certain comments made by Mr. Mannion
breached Rule 19.6(b) of the Irish Takeover Rules, which states that neither an
offeror nor the offeree nor any representative of either of them shall during
the course of an offer release any new information bearing on the offer or
contemplated offer in any interview or discussion with the media.
Date: 16 November 2006
The Participating Directors of Aer Lingus accept responsibility for the
information contained in this announcement. To the best of the knowledge and
belief of the Participating Directors (having taken all reasonable care to
ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this announcement is
in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect its
import. The "Participating Directors" means all of the directors of Aer Lingus
other than Mr Francis Hackett and Mr Michael Johns.
Mr Hackett and Mr Johns are not, for the time being, participating in the
Board's consideration of the Offer and related matters because the Participating
Directors have concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Company
and its shareholders as a whole if, for the time being, the Directors appointed
by the Minister for Transport and the Aer Lingus Employee Share Ownership Trust
respectively, did not so participate.
Aer Lingus is being advised by Goldman Sachs International, Merrion Stockbrokers
Limited and Goodbody Stockbrokers in relation to the Offer.
Goldman Sachs International, which is authorised and regulated in the United
Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority, is acting exclusively for Aer
Lingus Group plc and no one else in connection with the Offer by Ryanair
Holdings plc and will not be responsible to anyone other than Aer Lingus Group
plc for providing the protections afforded to customers of Goldman Sachs
International or for providing advice in relation to the Offer by Ryanair
Holdings plc or the contents of this announcement.
Merrion Stockbrokers Limited, which is regulated in Ireland by the Financial
Regulator, is acting exclusively for Aer Lingus Group plc and no one else in

Aer Lingus Group plc or Ryanair Holdings plc may be required to make disclosures

Irish Takeover Panel
09 November 2006
                        Irish Takeover Panel Announcement
    Offer by Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair") for Aer Lingus Group plc
                                   ("Aer Lingus")
The Panel has considered whether a statement made by Ryanair in an announcement
released on 20 October, 2006 complied with Rule 19.1 (standards of care) of the
Irish Takeover Panel Takeover Rules. The statement in question is:
".... Aer Lingus employees will realise over EUR220m from the sale of their Aer
Lingus Shares. This represents an average of over EUR60,000 for each employee".
Rule 19.1 requires inter alia that every document or statement issued in
connection with an offer by the offeror or the offeree meets the same standards
of accuracy, completeness and fair presentation as would be required of a
prospectus. Furthermore, the Rule requires that every document and statement
shall clearly state the source for any fact which is material to any argument
contained in it, including sufficient detail to enable the significance of the
Irish Takeover Panel Panel Announcement
fact to be assessed.
While some of the assumptions underpinning the figures in the statement are set
out in the announcement, the Panel decided that sufficient detail on the
assumptions underpinning the figures in the statement was not disclosed.
Consequently, Aer Lingus shareholders were provided with insufficient detail to
enable them to assess the significance of this statement. As such, the statement
did not satisfy the standards of completeness required under Rule 19.1(a) and
(b). Consequently, the Panel ruled that the statement breached Rule 19.1(a) and
(b).
The Panel notes that the announcement also refers to:
".... ESOT Members realising over EUR186 million for their Aer Lingus Shares,
which equates to an estimated average of EUR60,000 per ESOT Member".
In this regard, it should be noted that an announcement made by Aer Lingus ESOP
Trustee Limited on 26 October stated that based on the offer price, the average
proceeds before tax but after repayment of borrowing costs which would be
realised for each member by the ESOT if the Ryanair offer is accepted would be:
Employee members:    EUR38,864 on average per member
 Ex-employee members: EUR13,915 on average per member.

06 November 2006
                   RYANAIR ANNOUNCES RECORD HALF YEAR PROFITS
   NET PROFIT RISES BY 39% TO EUR329M - TRAFFIC GROWS 23% TO 22m RAISES FULL YEAR
                            GUIDANCE: UP 16% TO EUR350M.
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Monday, 6th November 2006)
announced record half year profits of EUR329m. Traffic grew by 23% to 22.1m
passengers, yields increased by 9% as total revenues rose by 33% to EUR1.256bn.
Unit costs increased by 7.5% as fuel costs rose by 42% to EUR337m. Despite these
significantly higher fuel costs, Ryanair's after tax margin for the half year
rose by 1 point to 26% as half year net profits increased by 39% to EUR329m.

Note 1: Adjusted profit after tax and EPS during the half year ended 30
September 2005 excludes a receipt, net of tax, of EUR5.2m arising from the
settlement of an insurance claim for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Announcing these results Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
"Ryanair has again, delivered record half year profits despite intense
competition and very high fuel prices. The Ryanair lowest fare model has
repeatedly proven that it can generate increased profitability and significant
passenger growth during difficult trading conditions while many of our
competitors are struggling to deliver profits or are losing money.
"Summer yields rose by 9% despite a 22% increase in seat capacity. This benign
yield environment continues to be driven by the multiple fuel surcharges imposed
by European flag carriers, which has widened the gap between their high fares
and Ryanair's lowest fares. Our unwavering determination to avoid fuel
surcharges has enabled us to deliver rapid traffic growth and generate higher
profits. Load factors were up 1 point as we launched 42 new routes and 3 new
bases.
"Ancillary revenues grew by 27%, again faster than the growth in passenger
volumes. Need a Hotel, our online hotel provider, has decided to terminate our
agreement with effect from December 31st, 2006. Whilst the terms of our
agreement are confidential, we anticipate that returns for the remainder of the
fiscal year will remain unaffected. We are confident that we can replace Need a
Hotel without affecting the returns this business generates. We also recently
launched our Bingo/Gaming website and our 15 million unique visitors each month
will now be offered the lowest fares and a flutter on our Bingo/Gaming website.
As we roll out our onboard mobile phone system next summer, passengers will also
be able to have a flutter whilst travelling on our 437 routes across Europe.
"We introduced a new service enhancement in November that will allow all
passengers to enjoy on-line check-in and/or priority boarding for just GBP2/EUR3 per
flight. Passengers travelling with hand luggage only, will continue to by pass
check-in queues and go directly to their boarding gate. This new service will
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results
extend the priority boarding facility to passengers travelling with checked-in
luggage who will now be entitled to board the aircraft first and choose their
seats.
"Unit costs increased by 7.5% primarily due to higher fuel, staff and airport
and handling costs. Fuel costs rose by 42% to EUR337m despite being almost fully
hedged during the quarter reflecting higher world fuel prices. For the remainder
of this fiscal year, we are 90% hedged at rates equivalent to $73 per barrel. We
have used the recent weakness in forward oil prices to hedge 50% of our
requirements for the quarter from October to December 2007 at a cost which is
10% lower than comparable Q3 this year. We continue to monitor forward prices
with a view to hedging our requirements for fiscal 2008 when opportunities
arise.
"Our new bases at Liverpool, East Midlands and Shannon performed well over the
summer, however, fares at Shannon continue to be materially lower than expected.
We announced 3 new bases at Bremen, Marseille and Madrid and advance bookings at
all 3 are strong. We announced a further 4 aircraft and 20 new routes at our
Dublin base commencing in early 2007 and these are already booking strongly. In
August we achieved another milestone and became the first European low fares
airline to carry 4m passengers in one month.
"In October we exercised options for 32 Boeing 737-800 next generation aircraft
to be delivered between September 2008 and June 2009 as part of our plan to
double in size to over 80m passengers by 2012. We also ordered 10 more aircraft
simulators (5 firm, 5 options), which will be delivered between 2008 and 2013
and will enable us to further reduce pilot training costs whilst improving
safety and training.
"We continue to oppose the BAA airport monopoly plans to build a GBP4bn gold
plated Taj Mahal at Stansted which we believe could be built for GBP1bn. The BAA
monopoly continues to build facilities, which do not meet users needs. Until
there is competition between the three London airports, airport charges will
continue to rise and passengers will have to suffer these over specified,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results
inefficient facilities. Ryanair continues to campaign for the break up of the
BAA airport monopoly. We are deeply concerned by the continuing under staffing
of security at Stansted airport which has led to repeated passenger and flight
delays. The management of Stansted security is inept, and the BAA has again
proven that it is incapable of providing adequate or appropriate security
services at Stansted. This shambles again highlights that the BAA is an
inefficient, incompetent airport monopoly which should be broken up.
"The tragedy at Dublin airport continues where the DAA monopoly recently
obtained planning approval for a second terminal at a cost of EUR750m which is 4.5
times more than the EUR170m cost it announced just 11 months earlier in Sept.
2005. Only a government owned monopoly would seek a cost increase of over 4 fold
- with no increase in passenger capacity - prior to applying for planning
permission! The DAA has recently proposed that an outrageous 60% increase in
charges at Dublin Airport to recoup the inflated cost of this facility which
Ryanair passengers will never use. Ryanair will continue to oppose this waste
and has appealed the planning decision.
"On the 5th October, we announced a Cash Offer for Aer Lingus of EUR2.80 per share
which valued Aer Lingus at approximately EUR1.48bn. We have acquired a 19.2% stake
in Aer Lingus at a cost of EUR254m. We believe there are significant
opportunities, by combining the purchasing power of Ryanair and Aer Lingus, to
substantially reduce its operating costs, increase efficiencies, and pass these
savings on in the form of lower fares to Aer Lingus' consumers. We plan to
retain the Aer Lingus brand and the Heathrow slots, and up-grade their dated
longhaul product and are committed to reducing their shorthaul fares by 2.5% per
year for a minimum of 4 years. We believe the combination of Aer Lingus and
Ryanair into one strong Irish airline group will be rewarding for consumers and
will enable us both to vigorously compete with the mega carriers in Europe. The
EU Competition Authority is currently reviewing the proposed acquisition and we
anticipate that the final outcome of their regulatory review will not be known
until late December, 2006. If our offer is not accepted by a majority of Aer
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results
Lingus shareholders, we will continue to be a significant minority shareholder,
and will exercise whatever influence we can to encourage Aer Lingus to reduce
costs and offer lower fares which is, we believe, its best strategy for the
future.
"We remain cautious in our outlook for H2 as we roll out substantial capacity
expansion and suffer significantly higher oil prices than the comparable period
last year. However, we expect to deliver significant traffic growth as we launch
130 new routes and 3 new bases, (Marseilles, Bremen and Madrid), albeit at
slightly lower load factors (down 2% monthly on last year) during H2 which
should result in better yield stability. The benign yield environment continues
thanks to multiple fuel surcharges of our competitors. Based on a reasonable
level of visibility, it now appears likely that yields in Q3 will be +2% to +3%
compared to our original forecast of a -5% decline. With little visibility in
Q4, we believe that yields may be slightly lower but not as much as the -5%
decline previously guided. Accordingly, we now expect yields to be flat over the
winter period although our net profit for H2 will still be lower than last year.
As a result, we now expect that the increase in Net Profit after tax for the
fiscal year will be approx. +16% to EUR350m, higher than our previous guidance of
approximately +11% to EUR335m.
"Whilst intense competition in the market continues, Ryanair's unique
combination of the lowest fare in every market, lowest cost base and industry
leading customer service will enable us to continue to lead the low fares
revolution for the benefit of our passengers, our staff and our shareholders".
Ryanair today announced that the Board of Directors intend to seek shareholder
approval for a 2 for 1 stock split at the Extraordinary General meeting to be
held in December on the proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus. The purpose of the
stock split is to improve the marketability and liquidity of the stock. The
existing ratio of 5 ordinary shares to 1 ADR will be retained.

          adoption of SFAS No. 123R, recorded incremental share-based compensation
         expense of EUR2.012 million in its US GAAP income statement.
        Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured
         compensation expense for its employee share-based compensation plans
         using the intrinsic method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25. The Company
         applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, as if the fair value
         based method has been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under
         APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Group's employee
         share options was equal to the market price of the underlying share on
         the date of grant, no compensation expense was recognised. If the
         Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
         123 to share-based compensation during the three month period ended
         September 30, 2005, reported income under US GAAP would have changed
         from EUR174.087 million to EUR173.796 million with resulting Net income per
         ADS, basic and diluted, of 113.57 Euro cents and 112.77 Euro cents
         respectively.
Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc for the six months ended
September 30, 2006
Introduction
We have been engaged by the Company to review the financial information which
comprises the consolidated balance sheet of Ryanair Holdings plc at September
30, 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income, statement of
recognised income & expense and cash flows for the six month period then ended
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -7-
and the related notes as set out on pages 1 to 7. We have read the other
information contained in the interim report and considered whether it contains
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
information.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with the terms of our
engagement to assist the Company in meeting the requirements of the Listing
Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK Financial Services Authority. Our
review has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company those matters
we are required to state to it in this report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company, for our review work, for this report, or for the
conclusions we have reached.
Directors' responsibilities
The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is
the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors
are responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Listing
Rules which require that the accounting policies and presentation applied to the
interim figures should be consistent with those applied in preparing the
preceding annual accounts except where there are any changes, and the reasons
for them, are disclosed.
Review work performed
We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4
"Review of Interim Financial Information" issued by the Auditing Practices Board
for use in Ireland and the United Kingdom. A review consists principally of
making enquiries of group management and applying analytical procedures to the
financial information and underlying financial data and, based thereon,
assessing whether the accounting policies and presentation have been
consistently applied unless otherwise disclosed. A review excludes audit
procedures such as tests of controls and verification of assets, liabilities and
transactions. It is substantially less in scope than an audit performed in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -7-
accordance with Auditing Standards and therefore provides a lower level of
assurance than an audit. Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the
financial information.
Review conclusion
On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial information as presented at and for the six
months ended September 30, 2006.

                 Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted income statement excluding exceptional items referred to below.
Exceptional items for the half year ended September 30, 2005 consist of a
receipt of EUR5.2m (net of tax) arising from the settlement of an insurance claim
for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Profit after tax increased by 36% to EUR329.1m during the six months ended
September 30, 2006 compared to last year. The adjusted profit for the half year,
increased by 39% to EUR329.1m.
Summary Half Year Ended September 30, 2006
Profit after tax increased by 36% to EUR329.1m, compared to EUR242.2m in the
previous half year ended September 30, 2005. These results were achieved by
strong growth in passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, excluding
fuel and staff costs, which were both significantly higher than in previous
periods. Total operating revenues increased by 33% to EUR1,256.4m, which is
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -5-
greater than the 23% growth in passenger volumes, as average fares rose by 9%
and ancillary revenues grew by 27% to EUR164.3m. Total revenue per passenger as a
result increased by 8% whilst Passenger Load Factor increased by 1 point to 87%
during the period.
Total operating expenses increased by 31% to EUR870.6m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, associated with the growth of the airline.
Fuel, which represents 39% of total operating costs compared to 36% last year,
increased by 42% to EUR337.0m due to substantial increases in the US dollar cost
per gallon, partially offset by a positive movement in the US dollar exchange
rate and a 2% reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of winglets
on a portion of our Boeing 737-800 fleet. The remaining retro-fit winglets will
be installed across the fleet by year end. Unit costs excluding fuel and staff
costs declined by 1%. Staff costs rose by 36% reflecting an increase in our
crewing ratios primarily as a result of increases in our sector length. Despite
the significantly higher fuel and staff costs incurred, operating margins
increased by 1 point to 31%, whilst operating profit before exceptional items
increased by 37% to EUR385.8m.
Net Margins increased by 1 point to 26% for the reasons outlined above.
Adjusted basic earnings per share have risen by 38% to EUR42.67 cent for the
period.
Balance Sheet
The strong growth in profitability continues to positively impact the balance
sheet with Total Cash increasing by EUR121.1m to EUR2,093.1m despite investing
EUR185.4m in a 15% stake in Aer Lingus and funding an additional EUR88.8m in capital
expenditure from internal resources. The company debt financed one Boeing
737-800 aircraft and funded additional aircraft deposits during the period.
Total debt declined during the period as repayments exceeded debt drawdown by
EUR42.8m. Shareholders' Funds at September 30, 2006 have increased by EUR304.8m to
EUR2,296.8m, compared to March 31, 2006 reflecting the EUR329.1m increase in
profitability during the period and the exercise of share options which
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -5-
increased shareholder funds by EUR6.5m, offset by a reduction of EUR30.8m resulting
from the required IFRS accounting treatment for derivative financial
instruments, pensions and stock options.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Half Year Ended September 30, 2006
Profit after tax, increased by 36% to EUR329.1m due to a 9% increase in average
fares, strong growth in ancillary revenues, and tight cost control which was
offset by fuel costs increasing by 42% to EUR337.0m primarily reflecting the
higher US dollar cost per gallon and a one off step up in staff costs which rose
by 36% to EUR113.8m. Operating margins, as a result, increased by 1 point to 31%,
which in turn resulted in operating profit before exceptional items increasing
by 37% to EUR385.8m compared to half year ended September 30, 2005.
Total operating revenues increased by 33% to EUR1,256.4m due to the combination of
a 23% increase in passengers carried, an improvement in average fares and the
growth of ancillary revenues.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 34% to EUR1,092.1m due to a 9%
improvement in average fares reflecting the benign yield environment supported
by competitor fuel surcharges and the positive impact of Easter in fares. Easter
is not included in the prior year comparative as it occurred earlier. Passenger
volumes increased by 23% to 22.1m reflecting increased passenger numbers on
existing routes, the successful launch of our new routes and expansion of our
bases. Load factor increased by 1 point to 87% during the period.
Ancillary revenues continue to perform strongly with revenues growing by 27% to
EUR164.3m in the period. This performance reflects the strong growth in on board
sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products. Ancillary
revenues continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes.
Total operating expenses rose by 31% to EUR870.6m due to the increased level of
activity, and the increased costs associated with the growth of the airline
particularly higher fuel and staff costs. Total operating costs were also
adversely impacted by a 5% increase in the average sector length, whilst higher
US dollar fuel prices were partly offset by the strength of the euro exchange
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -5-
rate against the US dollar.
Staff costs have increased by 36% to EUR113.8m. This primarily reflects a 31%
increase in average employee numbers to 3,768 and the impact of pay increases
granted during the period. Employee numbers rose due to an increase in our
aircraft crewing ratios as a result of continued increases in sector length.
Pilots, who earn higher than the average salary, accounted for 42% of the
increase in employment during the period.
Depreciation increased by 17% to EUR71.6m. There are an additional thirteen
'owned' Boeing 737-800 aircraft in the fleet this year compared to last year.
The resultant higher depreciation charge was offset by a combination of lower
amortisation due to the retirement of Boeing 737-200 aircraft and the positive
impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of Boeing
737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the euro to US dollar also had a positive
impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 42% to EUR337.0m due to a 21% increase in the number of hours
flown and a significant increase in the average US dollar cost per gallon of
fuel partially offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro to
the US dollar and a 2% reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of
winglets on part of our Boeing 737-800 fleet.
Maintenance costs increased by 27% to EUR21.3m, faster than the increase in the
number of hours flown, due to an increase in the number of leased Boeing 737-800
aircraft from 17 to 24, partially offset by the improved reliability of the
Boeing 737-800's operated, a lower level of maintenance costs incurred due to
the retirement of the Boeing 737-200's and the positive impact of the
strengthening of the euro exchange rate against the US dollar.

Marketing and distribution costs increased by 33% to EUR11.6m due to a higher
level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to the previous
year as the number of routes operated rose by 42% to 304 at the period end and
the number of bases increased by 1 to 15.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 23% to EUR25.4m reflecting an additional 7
aircraft on operating lease during the period.
Route charges rose by 17% to EUR98.4m due to an increase in the number sectors
flown, and a longer average sector length, offset by a reduction in enroute
charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 26% to EUR139.1m. This is higher than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
some of our airports and in particular at our Dublin base, which has a
significantly higher cost per passenger, offset by lower costs at new airports
and bases (excluding Dublin), and the positive impact of the euro/sterling
exchange rate during the period.
Other expenses increased by 25% to EUR52.3m, which is less than the growth in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -6-
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on certain indirect costs.
Operating margins have increased by 1 point to 31% for the period due to the
reasons outlined above which has resulted in operating profits increasing by 37%
to EUR385.8m.
Interest receivable has increased by 62% to EUR28.9m due to a combination of
higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in average deposit
rates earned in the period.
Interest payable increased by EUR4.5m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the
purchase of new aircraft during the period and higher floating interest rates.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in
profits during the period. The Company generated cash from operating activities
of EUR431.6m which part funded the investment in financial assets of EUR185.4m and
capital expenditure during the period with the balance reflected in Total Cash
of EUR2,093.0m. Capital expenditure of EUR88.8m primarily comprised of the delivery
of one aircraft and advance payments for future aircraft deliveries. Long term
debt, net of repayments decreased by EUR42.8m during the period.
Shareholders' Equity at September 30, 2006 has increased by EUR304.8m to
EUR2,296.8m, compared to March 31, 2006 reflecting the EUR329.1m increase in
profitability during the period and the exercise of share options which
increased shareholder funds by EUR6.5m, offset by a reduction of EUR30.8m resulting
from the IFRS accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments,
pensions and stock options.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended September 30, 2006
Profit after tax, increased by 24% to EUR213.4m due to average fares improving by
6% and strong ancillary revenue growth, which was offset by fuel costs which
rose 34% to EUR169.6m reflecting the higher US dollar cost per gallon and the one
off step up in staff costs which rose by 38% to EUR57.1m. Operating margins, as a
result of these higher costs, fell by 1 point to 36%. Strong cost control on
other line items coupled with increases in total operating revenues resulted in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -6-
operating profit increasing by 23% to EUR249.1m compared to the previous quarter
ended September 30, 2005.
Total operating revenues increased by 27% to EUR689.8m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 21% to 11.5m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 5% in the
quarter due to a combination of higher average fares, and strong ancillary
revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 28% to EUR602.1m due to a combination of
higher passenger numbers on existing routes, the successful launch of new routes
and a 6% improvement in average fares.
Ancillary revenues increased 23% to EUR87.7m, a faster growth rate than passenger
volumes, reflecting a strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues,
on-board sales and other ancillary products
Total operating expenses increased by 30% to EUR440.7m due to the increased level
of activity, and in particular higher fuel and staff costs. Total operating
costs were also adversely impacted by an increase in the average sector length,
whilst higher US dollar fuel prices were partially offset by the strength of the
euro exchange rate against the US dollar and lower fleet burn resulting from the
newly installed winglets.
Staff costs have increased by 38% to EUR57.1m primarily due to a 30% increase in
average employee numbers to 3,881 in the quarter and the impact of pay increases
granted. Employee numbers rose due to an increase in our aircraft crewing ratios
as a result of continued increases in average sector length. Pilots, who earn
higher than the average salary, accounted for 43% of the increase in employment
during the period.
Depreciation increased by 21% to EUR36.0m due to an increase in the size of the
'owned' fleet from 74 to 87, offset by a lower amortisation charge due to the
retirement of Boeing 737-200 aircraft and the positive impact of a new engine
maintenance deal on the cost of aircraft amortisation. The strengthening of the
euro to US dollar also had a positive impact on the depreciation and
amortisation charge relating to new aircraft deliveries.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -6-
Fuel costs rose by 34% to EUR169.6m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, a 6% increase in sector length, and a significantly higher average US
dollar cost per gallon of fuel. The increased costs were partially offset by the
positive impact of the strengthening of the euro to the US dollar during the
year and a 2% reduction in fuel consumption due to the installation of winglets
on part of our Boeing 737-800 fleet.
Maintenance costs increased by 39% to EUR10.6m faster than the increase in the
number of hours flown due to an increase in the number of leased Boeing 737-800
aircraft from 17 to 24, partially offset by the improved reliability of the
Boeing 737-800's operated, a lower level of maintenance costs incurred due to
the retirement of the Boeing 737-200's, and the positive impact of the
strengthening of the euro exchange rate against the US dollar.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 39% to EUR5.9m due to a higher level
of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to the previous year as
the number of routes operated rose by 42% to 304 at the period end and the
number of bases increased by 1 to 15.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 22% to EUR13.0m reflecting an additional 3
aircraft on operating lease during the period.
Route charges rose by 18% to EUR50.3m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown and an increase of 6% in the average sector length, offset by a reduction
in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 28% to EUR71.2m, which was higher than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports, specifically at our Dublin base which has a much
higher average cost per passenger, offset by lower costs at new airports and
bases, and the positive euro/sterling exchange rate.
Other expenses increased by 26% to EUR26.9m, which is higher than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products and cost
increases on some indirect costs.
Operating margins have fallen by 1 point to 36% due to the reasons outlined
Ryanair Holdings PLC Interim Results -6-
above whilst operating profits have increased by 23% to EUR249.1m during the
quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by 74% to EUR16.1m in the quarter due to the
combined impact of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in
average deposit rates earned compared to the same period last year.
Interest payable increased by 13% to EUR20.7m due to the drawdown of debt to part
fund the purchase of new aircraft and higher floating interest rates.
                       Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
    This period's financial information has been prepared in accordance with the
     accounting policies set out in Ryanair's consolidated financial statements
     for the year ended March 31, 2006, which were prepared in accordance with
     International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") as endorsed by the EU.
     The comparative financial information for the six month period ended
     September 30, 2005 has been restated on a consistent basis.
2. Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
    The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     half year ended September 30, 2006 on November 3, 2006.
3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
    The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the half year ended
     September 30, 2006 and the comparative period are based on the results
     reported under the group's IFRS accounting policies, as adjusted for certain
     exceptional items.
4. Available for Sale Securities
    During the period the company acquired a EUR185.4m stake in Aer Lingus
     representing 15% of its share capital at September 30, 2006.
5. Accounting for Share-Based Payments
        Under SFAS No. 123R, which was adopted by the Company on April 1, 2006,
         the Company is required to account for share-based employee compensation
         using a fair value based method. The Company has elected to use the
         Binomial Lattice option pricing model to determine the fair-value of
         share-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that previously
         used for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123 ("Accounting for
         Stock-Based Compensation").
        The Company has elected to use the modified prospective transition
         method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R and accordingly prior periods have
         not been restated to reflect the impact of the revised standard. In this
         period's financial information, the Company has, as a result of the

Aer Lingus Group PLC
27 October 2006
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                       STATEMENT BY AER LINGUS GROUP PLC
The statement issued by Ryanair Holdings plc at 4.39pm yesterday, Thursday 26th
October 2006, contains a number of serious inaccuracies and misrepresentations.
Specifically, its assertion that its conditional offer for Aer Lingus "equates
to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee, with a tax free option for ESOT
members" is incorrect and seriously misleading.
The facts are that the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) has approximately
4,665 members. After allowing for the ESOT's borrowings, the offer is worth an
average of approximately EUR32,500 per ESOT member. This inaccuracy had been drawn
to the attention of Ryanair.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Ryanair inaccuracies re ESOT
This purported tax-free status is highly conditional, dependent on Revenue
approval and, extraordinarily, dependent on Aer Lingus employees and former
employees going into the public markets and buying shares in Ryanair, a company
whose stock has under-performed other European airlines during 2006.
The numerous misrepresentations by Ryanair will be dealt with in full when Aer
Lingus issues its response to Ryanair's conditional offer.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
26 October 2006
                        RYANAIR URGES AER LINGUS WORKERS
                           TO ACCEPT RYANAIR'S OFFER
RYANAIR'S OFFER INVOLVES JOB CUTS AND AN AVERAGE OF EUR60K* PER EMPLOYEE, WHEREAS
                         AER LINGUS OFFERS ONLY JOB CUTS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, this afternoon (Thursday, 26th
October 2006) encouraged all Aer Lingus employees to accept Ryanair's generous
offer of EUR2.80 per share which will result in Aer Lingus employees realising
over EUR220m. for their shares in the airline, which equates to an average of over
EUR60,000* per employee, with a tax free option for ESOT members.
Reports in this morning's Irish newspapers indicated that the Chief Executive of
Aer Lingus, in a meeting with the trade unions last evening, highlighted the
need for significant cost cuts in Aer Lingus, and that this may include
significant job cuts. If these reports are true, it would appear that Aer
Lingus' response to Ryanair's offer is job cuts, but without an average payment
Ryanair Holdings PLC URGES WORKERS TO ACCEPT OFFER
of EUR60,000* per Aer Lingus employee.
Commenting on this development today, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary
said:
        "The difference between Ryanair's offer and the alternative reported Aer
         Lingus management offer is that at least with the Ryanair offer Aer
         Lingus employees stand to realise an average of over EUR60,000* per
         person. With Ryanair, Aer Lingus will have a strong financial partner
         and a secure future. As a small stand alone airline, Aer Lingus' only
         alternative appears to be further cost cuts, more job cuts, but without
         any average payment of EUR60,000* to Aer Lingus employees.
        "If these developments are true, it's clear that the best interests of
         Aer Lingus employees are served by accepting Ryanair's generous offer,
         because their future as a small uncompetitive, stand alone Aer Lingus
         looks even bleaker today than it did yesterday".
* See Section 8, Appendix 4 of the Ryanair Offer Document.

Ryanair Holdings PLC
24 October 2006
                RYANAIR BUYS 10 CAE FLIGHT SIMULATORS WORTH $80M
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 24th October 2006)
announced the purchase of 10 flight simulators from CAE, the world's leading
provider of flight simulators for pilot training, in a deal worth over $80M.
The CAE full-flight simulators replicate in every detail the cockpit of
Ryanair's Boeing 737-800 series fleet, reproducing with great accuracy real
flight conditions for the recurrent training of Ryanair pilots.
Announcing the purchase of the CAE simulators today, Howard Millar, Ryanair's
CFO and Deputy CEO said:
        "With this investment, Ryanair will continue to provide world class
         pilot training for its flight crews, as it doubles in size over the next
         5 years from 42.5M passengers this year to more than 80M passengers in
         2012. Over the period Ryanair's fleet, the youngest of any major airline
         in Europe, will grow from 113 Boeing 737-800 aircraft to 234 aircraft on
         firm order.
        "The simulators are for delivery from 2008 and will facilitate the
Ryanair Holdings PLC BUYS 10 CAE FLIGHT SIMULATORS
         expansion of Ryanair's lowest fares across Europe".

                    RYANAIR CALL ON ENTIRE AER LINGUS BOARD
                              TO RECUSE THEMSELVES
Ryanair today (Monday, 23rd October 2006) called on the balance of the Aer
Lingus Board to recuse themselves on the grounds that they were all appointed by
the Minister for Transport.
In a Stock Exchange statement issued by Aer Lingus this afternoon, two Directors
Mr. Francis Hackett and Mr. Michael Johns have confirmed that they are not
participating in the Board's consideration of the Offer and related matters
because it would not be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders
as a whole as they were appointed by the Minister for Transport. As this is the
case, the balance of the Aer Lingus Board should follow suit.
The Aer Lingus Prospectus (page 181) clearly states that the entire Board were
appointed by the Minister: "As at the date of this Prospectus, the Directors of
Ryanair Holdings PLC A Lingus Brd to Recuse
the Company have been appointed by the Minister for Transport".
The Minister for Transport has publicly stated his and the Governments
opposition to the Ryanair bid. It is therefore not appropriate for his
appointees to decide what is in the best interest of the Company and its
shareholders, as they are also conflicted and therefore should recuse
themselves.
Ends.                                                 Monday, 23rd October 2006

The Directors of Ryanair accept responsibility for the information contained in
this announcement. To the best of the knowledge and belief of the directors of
Ryanair (who have taken all reasonable care to ensure that such is the case),
the information contained in this announcement for which they accept
responsibility is in accordance with the facts and does not omit anything likely

Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or

                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                    REJECTION BY AER LINGUS OF RYANAIR OFFER
The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus") notes the publication of the
offer document by Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair") making its offer to purchase
the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus
not already owned by Ryanair (the "Offer").
The Board of Aer Lingus, which has already rejected the Offer, will formally
respond in detail when it issues its response setting out the views of the
Participating Directors on the Offer within the next fourteen days. In the
meantime, Aer Lingus shareholders are strongly urged to take no action in
relation to the Offer.
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of Ryanair Offer
Aer Lingus is one of Europe's most profitable airlines, with a consistent track
record for generating strong returns on its capital. It is well positioned to
benefit from numerous growth opportunities relating to both its long and short
haul networks as a result of its strong market position in Ireland and the depth
and experience of its management team.
Commenting on the Offer, John Sharman, Chairman of Aer Lingus, said: "The Offer
from Ryanair is without merit. It fails to recognise the unique position of the
Group's businesses, its outstanding track record and its excellent growth
prospects. The Offer also ignores the significant regulatory issues that a
combination would face. A takeover by Ryanair, no matter how it is dressed up,
