Ryanair Holdings PLC
20 October 2006
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
  Ryanair announces that the Offer Document to Aer Lingus shareholders will be
                        posted on Monday, 23 October 2006.
A Ryanair statement outlining the key elements of the Offer Document is set out
                                      below.
The Board of Ryanair Holdings plc announced today (Friday, 20 October 2006) that
the Offer Document will be published and posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on
Monday next, 23 October 2006. On 5 October 2006, Ryanair announced a Cash Offer
of EUR2.80 per Aer Lingus Share, which values Aer Lingus at approximately EUR1.48bn,
significantly higher than the EUR1.16bn IPO value of just 8 days previously.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
"Ryanair believes that its Cash Offer represents excellent value for Aer Lingus
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc
Shareholders and offers significant attractions to Aer Lingus' stakeholders.
This Offer represents a unique opportunity to form one strong Irish airline
group with over 50 million passengers per annum, capable of competing against
the three European mega carriers. Ryanair's strategy will be to expand, enhance
and upgrade Aer Lingus' operations. Without Ryanair, Aer Lingus will continue to
be a small regional European airline which, because of its size and regional
nature, is unlikely to be of interest or relevance to the three major European
airline groupings.
Excellent Value for Aer Lingus Shareholders
   27% Premium on IPO
On 27 September 2006, the Government of Ireland, Aer Lingus and their respective
advisers determined that EUR2.20 was an appropriate price at which to issue and
sell Aer Lingus Shares pursuant to the IPO. The ESOT also agreed to this price.
The Ryanair Offer of EUR2.80 is a generous premium of 27 per cent. in just 8 days.
   Ryanair stakebuilding has supported share price appreciation since IPO
The price appreciation of Aer Lingus Shares post the IPO but prior to Ryanair's
Cash Offer on 5 October 2006 occurred over the same short period during which
Ryanair was purchasing a 16 per cent. stake in Aer Lingus at an average price of
EUR2.42. On 2 October and 3 October, days during which Ryanair was not actively
purchasing Aer Lingus Shares, the average price per Aer Lingus Share fell back
from EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
   Volatile earnings record of Aer Lingus
Aer Lingus is an airline with a volatile earnings record which came close to
bankruptcy four years ago, and whose cumulative losses (EUR616m) exceeded its
cumulative profits (EUR433m) over the past 14 years by over EUR180m. By contrast,
Ryanair has been profitable in every one of the past 14 years.
   Irish Government receives over EUR500 million and achieves its strategic
     objectives
If it accepts the Cash Offer the Irish Government will realise over EUR500 million
from the sale of its Aer Lingus Shares whilst also achieving its stated
objectives of retaining the Heathrow slots and the Aer Lingus brand, and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc
securing the long term future of the airline.
   Aer Lingus employees realise an average of over EUR60,000 each - tax free
     structure for ESOT Members
If they accept our Cash Offer, Aer Lingus employees will realise over EUR220m from
the sale of their Aer Lingus Shares. This represents an average of over EUR60,000
for each employee. There is also a means by which Aer Lingus employees and
former employees, who are ESOT Members, can realise the proceeds of the sale of
the shares held by the ESOT in a tax free manner (see the Appendix to this
announcement). Ryanair believes that the consequences of its bid failing will be
that Aer Lingus employees will hold a substantial minority shareholding, the
value of which will have fallen significantly, in an illiquid company, and
Ryanair would urge ESOT Members to bear this in mind in their consideration of
the Offer and their communications with the ESOT trustees.
Good for competition and good for consumers
Ryanair's Offer commits to maintaining Aer Lingus as a stand-alone separate
airline. Because the two airlines will compete vigorously, this will not lead to
a monopoly. In any event, the question of a monopoly does not arise as there are
50 other scheduled airlines competing with Ryanair and/or Aer Lingus at Dublin
Airport, some of which (Air France, Lufthansa and British Airways) are
significantly larger than Ryanair and Aer Lingus combined.
There is little crossover because Ryanair and Aer Lingus only compete on about
17 of more than 500 combined routes.
Whilst Ryanair and Aer Lingus have 61% of movements at Dublin Airport, this is
not dissimilar to other large airline groupings at other European airports
including SAS and its Lufthansa partners in Copenhagen (over 85% of seats),
Austrian and its Lufthansa partners in Vienna (over 70% of movements), Olympic
in Athens (over 73% of seats), TAP and its Star Alliance Partners in Lisbon (60%
of seats), Air France and its Sky Team Associates in Charles de Gaulle (62% of
movements), and Lufthansa and its Star Alliance Partners in Munich (67% of
movements).
During the 6 months to 30 June 2006, Aer Lingus' average short haul fare
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc
increased by 2% to EUR86.49. This is in line with Aer Lingus' strategy to
"Maximise Passenger Revenues" (Source: IPO Prospectus, p71). Similarly, Aer
Lingus has refused to reduce its fuel surcharge despite recent falls in oil
prices. Rising fares and high fuel surcharges are bad for competition and bad
for consumers.
By contrast, Ryanair's Offer guarantees to reduce Aer Lingus' short haul fares
by 21/2% per year for a minimum period of 4 years and to reduce Aer Lingus' fuel
surcharges as oil prices fall. Lower fares and lower surcharges will be good for
consumers. Ryanair's Offer will therefore increase competition and lower prices
which is good for consumers.
Good for the future of Aer Lingus
The board of Ryanair believes that this Offer represents a unique opportunity to
form one strong Irish airline group with over 50 million passengers per annum,
capable of competing against the three European mega-carriers (Air France,
British Airways and Lufthansa). Without Ryanair, Aer Lingus will continue to be
a small regional European airline which, because of its size and regional
nature, is unlikely to be of interest or relevance to the three major European
airline groupings.
Ryanair provides Aer Lingus with a strong airline partner of substantial
financial strength and access to low cost aircraft and financing. Ryanair's
strategy will be to expand, enhance and upgrade Aer Lingus' operations. Ryanair
intends to retain the Aer Lingus brand and operate the two airlines separately.
Both companies will continue to compete vigorously in the small number of routes
(about 17) where they currently compete, and will focus on reducing costs and
lowering air fares.
If successful, the Offer will replicate similar airline consolidations in other
European countries by the likes of British Airways (which acquired British
Caledonian, Danair, and Cityflyer and invested in Iberia); Air France (which
acquired KLM, Britair and Regional) and Lufthansa (which acquired Eurowings,
Swiss, and Lufthansa Cityline and invested in SAS and BMI). This pan-European
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc
trend towards airline consolidation has seen the emergence of three "mega
carriers", Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa. A privatized Aer Lingus
(without a strategic partner) will be unable to compete with these mega carriers
because it has neither the scale nor the route network. Equally Aer Lingus will
be unable to compete with low cost carriers such as Ryanair because it has
neither the cost base nor the low fare structure.
Isolated as a small regional airline, Aer Lingus will continue to be at the
mercy of its controlling shareholders (the Irish Government and the workers/
trade unions) whose de facto control over the airline in recent years has seen
it:
   Lurch from crisis to crisis.
    Incur substantial cumulative losses.
    Suffer repeated strikes, work stoppages and industrial action.
    Discourage successful management.
    Preside over 3,000 job losses.
    Significantly reduce services on routes between Ireland and the UK.
Brighter future with Ryanair
Ryanair offers a better, viable, financially secure future for Aer Lingus
through its strategy which includes:
   Reducing Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005) by 10% over
     the next four years. These fare reductions will promote competition, will
     benefit consumers and will reverse Aer Lingus' current strategy which is to
     "maximise passenger revenues". (Source: IPO Prospectus.)
    Reducing Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as oil prices fall (something that
     Aer Lingus recently refused to do).
    Retaining the Aer Lingus brand and continuing to operate the two airlines
     separately.
    Retaining all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus.
    Reducing Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies, superior
     purchasing power and lowering overheads.
    Assisting Aer Lingus with its fleet expansion either by providing it with
     access to Ryanair's lower cost aircraft, or using Ryanair's purchasing power
     to negotiate lower costs with aircraft manufacturers.
    Upgrading Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and updating its long haul
     product.
    Improving Aer Lingus' inferior customer service by reducing delays,
     cancellations and lost baggage.
Statements of Aer Lingus Board and the Minister for Transport
Aer Lingus board announcement 5th October 2006
In its announcement which appeared on the RNS on 5 October last, the Aer Lingus
board claimed:
"This approach is unsolicited, wholly opportunistic and significantly

undervalues the Group's businesses and attractive long term growth potential."

    Shannon to London            60%               37%             -38%
    Aer Lingus' high fares render it unable to compete with Ryanair and other
     airlines including Easyjet, and this casts considerable doubt on its
     profitability and revenue maximisation strategy. Over recent years Aer
     Lingus has been forced either to withdraw or reduce services across most of
     the key Ireland to UK routes including Gatwick, London City, Stansted,
     Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow and Edinburgh.
2. Aer Lingus' cost per passenger is too high
    Aer Lingus' estimated average cost per short-haul passenger at EUR80, is
     double that of Ryanair. Given Aer Lingus' dependence on the Irish market,
     its rising cost base, and its inability to compete with Ryanair and other
     carriers, it is inevitable that Aer Lingus will struggle to compete with
     Ryanair's lower fares on both its UK and European routes.
3. Customer service delivery requires improvement
    Aer Lingus' customer service delivery continues to underperform compared to
     Ryanair. We believe that Aer Lingus' "on time" performance, rate of flight
     cancellations and lost baggage record have historically lagged behind those
     of Ryanair. The CAA's punctuality statistics for 2005 show that just 72% of
     Aer Lingus' UK flights operated on time, way behind Ryanair's 81% record.
     Because of Ryanair's superior customer service delivery and lower prices,
     Ryanair believes that on most routes where passengers have a choice, many
     more of them prefer to fly with Ryanair.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -3-
4. Aer Lingus revenue maximisation strategy is unlikely to be achieved
    Ryanair has recently announced further new route expansion from Dublin to
     Continental Europe. In Summer 2007, Ryanair will offer 53 European routes
     from Dublin compared to just 33 in Summer 2006. Whether this Offer succeeds
     or otherwise, the amount and extent of competition between Ryanair and Aer
     Lingus will intensify further next year. Ryanair's lower fares, younger
     fleet, lower cost base and better frequencies will put downward pressure on
     Aer Lingus' short haul fares and its profitability at a time when its stated
     strategy is "Maximising Passenger Revenues" (i.e. not passing on savings
     to passengers but charging them as much as Aer Lingus will get away with).
5. Aer Lingus' high fuel surcharges inhibit long haul growth
    Aer Lingus' refusal to reduce its fuel surcharges as oil prices fall will
     inhibit the growth of its long haul business. Aer Lingus confirmed in the
     Irish media on 4 October that it "had no plans to abolish or reduce their
     fuel surcharges despite falling oil prices" (Source: Irish Independent).
    The Consumer Association of Ireland called on Aer Lingus to abolish or
     reduce its fuel surcharges given that oil prices had fallen by up to 25% in
     recent weeks. The continuation of these high surcharges at a time when oil
     prices have fallen is bad for consumers and competition.
  6. Aer Lingus is exposed to high and rising costs at Dublin Airport
    As the IPO Prospectus confirms, Aer Lingus - unlike Ryanair - is heavily
     dependent on Dublin Airport (i.e. the DAA). This exposes Aer Lingus to high
     and rising costs at Dublin due to Aer Lingus' lack of purchasing power. The
     DAA monopoly recently proposed a second terminal at a cost of over EUR750m -
     41/2 times more than the original EUR170m cost announced in August 2005. This
     fourfold increase in the cost of this facility (which is designed primarily
     for Aer Lingus) has led the Chairman of the DAA to announce recently that it
     would be seeking a 60% increase in charges at Dublin Airport. Any such cost
     increase will have a detrimental impact on Aer Lingus' costs (and hence
     passenger fares) because of its over-reliance on Dublin. Furthermore, as a
     small regional airline, Aer Lingus has little purchasing power and will
     continue to be at the mercy of substantial cost increases at many airports
     and other providers of services and products.
7. Aer Lingus is a small, regional, peripheral European carrier
    With 8 million passengers annually compared to Ryanair's estimated 42.5
     million this year, Aer Lingus is smaller than many other similar European
     mid-size carriers who have in recent years either been taken over or have
     sold significant minority stakes to one of the European mega carriers. Aer
     Lingus is smaller in traffic terms than other such European regional
     airlines including Swiss, BMI, SAS (all Lufthansa subsidiaries/associates),
     KLM (Air France), Iberia (BA), Alitalia and Air Berlin. Because of its
     peripheral location and modest size, Aer Lingus is unlikely to be an
     attractive partner to any of the European mega carriers (Air France, BA,
     Lufthansa) as is evidenced by Aer Lingus' recent decision to terminate its
     membership of BA's One World alliance.
    Without a strong financial/airline partner, Aer Lingus will be exposed to
     the volatility of the international markets and the cyclical nature of the
     air travel industry. As an indication of how Ryanair could transform Aer
     Lingus' purchasing power, Ryanair has in the last month purchased more new
     short haul aircraft (32) than are in Aer Lingus' entire short haul fleet
     (28).
8. Aer Lingus' isolation will limit growth
    Without Ryanair's investment, Aer Lingus will be excluded from the EU-wide
     trend towards airline consolidation. This consolidation will have damaging
     consequences for Aer Lingus' existing business.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -3-
    SUSTAINABILITY OF CURRENT SHARE PRICE IS UNCERTAIN WITHOUT RYANAIR
9. Share price inflated by Ryanair offer
    Aer Lingus' post IPO share price increased largely on the back of Ryanair's
     stake building. During the two days (Mon 2nd and Tues 3rd October) during
     which Ryanair was not actively buying shares, the price of Aer Lingus shares
     fell back from EUR2.48 to EUR2.44, and then from EUR2.44 to EUR2.41. Aer Lingus'
     share price is likely to fall significantly if the Ryanair bid fails.
10. Free float will be limited
    Ryanair is committed to maintaining a significant minority stake in Aer
     Lingus. The Government has confirmed that it "remains committed to
     maintaining a share of least 25.1%" (Source: Statement of Minister for
     Transport, 6 October 2006). The ESOT and employees could hold up to a
     further 15%. If the Ryanair bid fails, this shareholder profile will
     significantly reduce Aer Lingus' free float, which will make for an illiquid
     market in Aer Lingus' shares.
11. Adverse consequences for ESOT shareholding
    Ryanair believes that the consequences of its bid failing will be that the
     ESOT will hold a substantial minority shareholding, the value of which will
     have fallen significantly, in an illiquid company, and Ryanair would urge
     ESOT Members to bear this in mind in their consideration of the Offer and
     their communications with the ESOT trustees. By contrast, if the ESOT
     accepts this Offer, it will realise a substantial premium over the IPO
     price, its members will be working for a much more secure Irish airline
     group, it will own highly liquid shares in Ryanair with an option to dispose
     of them over the coming years in a tax free structure (as set out in the
     Appendix to this announcement), and Aer Lingus employees can realise an
     average of over EUR60,000 tax free per person.
    CONTINUATION OF GOVERNMENT / TRADE UNION CONTROL COULD IMPAIR SHAREHOLDERS'
     INVESTMENT
12. Government and Trade Union domination will not be in all shareholders'
     interest
If the bid fails, Ryanair will be a significant minority shareholder, without
board representation and with no influence over the day to day management and
operations of Aer Lingus. The airline will continue to be dominated by the Irish
Government and the ESOT/employees/trade unions who between them currently
control over 40% of the airline's shares and have appointed all of the current
board of directors. In these circumstances the dominant influence in Aer Lingus
will continue to be the interests of employees rather than the interests of all
shareholders.
The directors of Aer Lingus may find it very difficult to discharge their
fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company as a whole, and the
Aer Lingus board may well face the prospect of stalemate, ineffectiveness and
conflict.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -3-
"Employee interest" domination has impaired the performance of Aer Lingus in
recent years. Examples include:
   A history of strikes, stoppages and inefficient work practices.
    An inconsistent and volatile earnings record. Aer Lingus' cumulative
     losses (EUR616m) significantly exceeded its cumulative profits (EUR433m) over
     the last 14 years. This has forced the airline into two substantial
     re-organisations, yet despite this its costs per passenger are double that
     of Ryanair.
    Aer Lingus courted bankruptcy on two occasions in recent years and only
     survived following a massive injection of over EUR220m of State aid and two
     radical restructuring plans.
    Effective management is discouraged. The previous management team (led by
     Willie Walsh) departed in January 2005 having been roundly criticised and
     undermined by both the trade unions and the Irish government. The Prime
     Minister in the Irish Parliament attacked the management's then proposed MBO
     as "(a time) when management wanted to steal the assets for themselves
     through a management buyout, shafting staff interests". Investors will be

It is extraordinary for the Aer Lingus board to claim that Ryanair's Offer
"significantly undervalues" Aer Lingus when Ryanair's EUR2.80 offer per share
represents a 27% premium to the EUR2.20 per share valuation which the board of Aer
Lingus agreed just 8 days previously.
Minister Cullen's statement 6th October 2006
Taking just a few of the points made by Minister Cullen in his statement,
Ryanair responds as
follows:
        (a) "...I do not consider that the Government's and Ireland's strategic
         objectives would be well served by a takeover of Aer Lingus by
         Ryanair."
        Ryanair believes that its proposal represents Aer Lingus' best
         opportunity to remain an Irish headquartered, managed, controlled and
         regulated airline, fully focused on Irish strategic objectives.
         Ryanair's Offer clearly meets the Government's strategy by securing the
         future of Aer Lingus, retaining the Heathrow slots and Aer Lingus'
         branding. Ryanair's Offer - if accepted - will establish one strong
         Irish airline group (as there is in the UK (BA), Germany (Lufthansa) and
         France (Air France)) which clearly meets Ireland's strategic objectives.
(b)     "The IPO means that Aer Lingus is better positioned than ever in the
         past, to grow and develop its business and to minimise the opportunities
         for competitors."
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
        If Ryanair's Offer fails, Aer Lingus will continue to be under the de
         facto control of the Government and unions. Given this Government's
         track record on aviation and transport issues generally (ranging from
         the state monopolies of Dublin Airport Authority, Dublin Bus, and CIE
         and all points between) this will mean that the dead hand of
         anti-competitive, monopolistic and anti-consumer policies continues to
         drag down Aer Lingus. Ryanair finds it unusual that the Minister now
         confirms that the rationale for the IPO of Aer Lingus was to "minimise
         the opportunities for competitors".
(c)    "Delivering a single airline group as Ryanair suggests will not deliver
        the benefits to the Irish consumer that Ryanair has suggested."
        This claim is without foundation given that Ryanair's Offer, if
         successful, commits it to reducing Aer Lingus' fares by 21/2% per year
         for a minimum period of 4 years and reducing the fuel surcharge, both of
         which are clearly of benefit to, and have the support of, consumers.
(d)    "consumer interests are best served by having a variety of product
         offerings that meet the requirements of different segments of the market
         and our policy in respect of airlines and airports has been developed to
         deliver this and to facilitate flexibility and choice for the consumer."
        Ryanair's Offer for Aer Lingus guarantees that Aer Lingus and Ryanair
         will continue to be run and managed separately, serving different market
         segments, with different product offerings. The combination of Ryanair
         and Aer Lingus will still find it difficult to advance consumer
         interests when dealing with uncompetitive monopolies, such as the DAA,
         which are owned, protected and operated by the Minister for Transport.
         The DAA currently proposes to increase passenger charges by 60% at
         Dublin Airport.
 e.     "The Ryanair low-cost model has transformed the aviation experience for
         consumers and nowhere more than Ireland."
        For all of the reasons set out in this announcement and as our proven
         track record clearly demonstrates, Ryanair believes that our generous
         offer for Aer Lingus will ensure that Aer Lingus' customers will in
         future enjoy and benefit from our plan to lower fares and improve
         services in a stand alone, separately managed Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's Cash Offer delivers excellent value for Aer Lingus' Shareholders
whilst ensuring that the price on offer is one which will enable Ryanair to
continue to realise its objective of developing Aer Lingus, lowering fares and
advancing the best interests of Irish and European consumers.
Full details of the Cash Offer, including the terms and conditions under which
it is being made, will be posted to Aer Lingus shareholders on Monday next, 23rd
October 2006. The Cash Offer is conditional, amongst other things, upon
acceptances being received in respect of more than 50% of the Aer Lingus Shares
the subject of the Offer, including any Aer Lingus Shares beneficially owned or
controlled by Ryanair.
Full details for enquiries are printed at the end of this announcement:
                             THE RYANAIR CASH OFFER
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
Ryanair's generous cash offer
1. EUR2.80 is an excellent offer
    Ryanair's Offer of EUR2.80 in cash per Aer Lingus Share values Aer Lingus
     Group plc at approximately EUR1.481bn compared to its flotation value of
     EUR1.163bn just 8 days prior to Ryanair's Offer.
2. 27% premium in just 1 week
    The Offer represents a premium of approx 27% over the IPO price of Aer
     Lingus (EUR2.20) which was agreed as an appropriate value by the Government of
     Ireland, the Board of Aer Lingus, the ESOT and their respective advisers, on
     27 September - just 8 days prior to Ryanair's Offer.
3. Ryanair's bid is supporting an inflated share price
    If the Offer is not accepted, there is a likelihood that the share price of
     Aer Lingus will fall significantly. During the two days (Mon 2nd and Tue 3rd
     October) when Ryanair was not actively buying in the market, the Aer Lingus
     share price fell from EUR2.48 to EUR2.44, and from EUR2.44 to EUR2.41.
4. Government to realise over EUR500m
    If the Offer is accepted, the Irish Government will realise a total of over
     EUR500m from the sale of its stake in Aer Lingus, an enormous return from an
     airline which was, by its own admission, on the edge of bankruptcy just four
     years ago.
 5. Aer Lingus employees realise an average of over EUR60k each - tax free
     structure for ESOT
    If the Offer is accepted, Aer Lingus employees stand to realise over EUR220m,
     which equates to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee, and there is a
     mechanism which would allow ESOT Members to realise the proceeds of the
     shares held by the ESOT on a tax free basis.
6. Volatile earnings record of Aer Lingus
    Aer Lingus is an airline with a volatile earnings record which came close to
     bankruptcy four years ago, and whose cumulative losses (EUR616m) exceeded its
     cumulative profits (EUR433m) over the past 14 years by over EUR180m. Aer Lingus'
     earnings prospects will be enhanced by acceptance of the Ryanair Offer.
7. Ryanair's Offer will not lead to a monopoly
    Ryanair's Offer commits to maintaining Aer Lingus as a stand-alone separate
     airline. The two airlines will compete vigorously, therefore this will not
     lead to a monopoly. Aer Lingus' IPO document confirms that there is little
     crossover because Ryanair and Aer Lingus only compete on about 17 of more
     than 500 combined routes (Source: IPO Prospectus, p79).
    Whilst Ryanair and Aer Lingus together account for 61% of aircraft movements
     at Dublin Airport, this is not dissimilar to other large airline groupings
     at other European airports. For instance, SAS and its Lufthansa partners
     have over 85% of seats in Copenhagen, Austrian and its Lufthansa partners
     have over 70% of movements in Vienna, Olympic has over 73% of seats in
     Athens, TAP and its Star Alliance Partners have 60% of seats in Lisbon, Air
     France and its Sky Team Associates have 62% of movements in Charles de
     Gaulle, and Lufthansa and its Star Alliance Partners have 67% of movements
     in Munich.
    In addition, Dublin continues to be served by over 50 other scheduled
     airlines currently serving 112 international destinations, each of which is
     free to open new routes and increase services at Dublin should they so wish.
     Some of these airlines are significantly larger than the Ryanair/Aer Lingus
Ryanair Holdings PLC Key Elements of Offer Doc -2-
     combination would be (e.g. British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France/KLM).
     Moreover, these airlines can be joined by other airlines who wish to enter
     or grow the market as Ryanair continues to do.
8. Good for competition and good for consumers
During the 6 months to 30 June 2006, Aer Lingus' average short haul fare
increased by 2% to EUR86.49. This is in line with Aer Lingus' stated strategy to
"Maximise Passenger Revenues" (Source: IPO Prospectus, p71). Similarly, Aer
Lingus has recently refused to reduce its fuel surcharge despite recent falls in
oil prices (Source: Irish Independent, 4 October 2006). Rising fares and high
fuel surcharges are bad for competition and bad for consumers.
By contrast, Ryanair's Offer guarantees to reduce Aer Lingus' short haul fares
by 2.5% per year for a minimum period of 4 years and to reduce Aer Lingus' fuel
surcharges as oil prices fall. Lower fares and lower surcharges will be good for
consumers. Ryanair's Offer will therefore increase competition and lower prices
which is good for consumers and should stimulate growth.
             YOUR ALTERNATIVE (IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE CASH OFFER)
        AER LINGUS FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS A SMALL REGIONAL AIRLINE
               IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WITH A HIGH FARE STRUCTURE
                        AND AN UNCOMPETITIVE COST BASE.
         SUSTAINABILITY OF AER LINGUS PROFITABILITY IS UNCERTAIN
1. Aer Lingus' short haul fares are uncompetitive
    Aer Lingus' average short haul fare of EUR87.55 is hopelessly uncompetitive in
     the face of Ryanair's average equivalent of EUR41.23. As a result, Aer Lingus
     has seen its share of traffic between Ireland and the UK collapse in recent
     years as highlighted in the table below.
                             Aer Lingus' Share of Traffic Collapses

      exposed to the continuing practice of the Irish government, trade unions and
     employees to run Aer Lingus in the interests of staff rather than the
     interests of all shareholders.
    The record of European airlines which continue to be dominated by
     governments and trade unions is an abysmal one. It is characterised by
     bankruptcy (in the case of Sabena and Swissair) or chronic and repeated
     crises (in the case of Alitalia and Olympic Airways).
At a time when the overwhelming majority of major European airlines, including
British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France, have moved from government to private
ownership through stock market flotations, the future of Aer Lingus, and so your
investment, can only be damaged if the Irish government and employee interests
continue to maintain de facto control of Aer Lingus in the event of this bid not
succeeding.

following a new route press conference this morning in Dublin, as to whether
Ryanair would increase its Offer.
Ryanair's Offer is an excellent Offer and the Board has not considered any
increase in the Offer for Aer Lingus and therefore any increase cannot be ruled
in or ruled out.

Ryanair has been flying to/from Spain since 2003 and in less than three years it
has completely transformed the air travel market in the Iberian peninsula by
giving Spanish passengers and visitors the lowest fares, the best punctuality
and no fuel surcharges, guaranteed. Ryanair's enormous popularity in Spain has
delivered unparalleled growth and today it operates:
   108 routes to/from Spain
    17 Spanish airports
    2 Spanish bases in Madrid and Barcelona
    11 based aircraft
    Delivering 9M passengers p.a.
Announcing Ryanair's 18th European base in Madrid, Michael Cawley, Ryanair's
Deputy CEO said:
        "Ryanair is delighted to make Madrid Barajas its 18th European and
         second Spanish base. We welcome the development of facilities in Madrid
         Barajas airport to encourage low fares and competition which have won
         this new base for the Spanish capital. As a result Ryanair will invest
         $210M in 3 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and open new routes from Madrid to 14
         exciting destinations. This will transform the market in Madrid by
         allowing passengers to fly for a fraction of the high fares charged by
         Iberia.
        "Ryanair's 1 M passengers per annum will deliver a visitor spend of
         EUR110M that will sustain 1,000 jobs and stimulate business and tourism
         throughout the whole Madrid region.
        "These new routes are available for booking today from just EUR1* on
         www.ryanair.com and we advise passengers to book early as demand will be
         very strong".

DEFINITION OF ASSOCIATE
Aviva PLC Rule 8.3- RYANAIR HOLDINGS
It is not practicable to define associate in terms which would cover all the
different relationships which may exist in an offer. The term associate is
intended to cover all persons (whether or not acting in concert) who directly or
indirectly own or deal in the shares of an offeror or the offeree company in an
offer and who have (in addition to their normal interests as shareholders) an
interest or potential interest, whether commercial, financial or personal, in
the outcome of the offer.
Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the term associate will
normally include the following:-
(1) an offeror's or the offeree company's parent, subsidiaries and fellow
subsidiaries, and their associated companies, and companies of which such
companies are associated companies (for this purpose ownership or control of 20%
or more of the equity share capital of a company is regarded as the test of
associated company status);
(2) banks and financial and other professional advisers (including stockbrokers)
* to an offeror, the offeree company or any company covered in (1), including
persons controlling#, controlled by or under the same control as such banks,
financial and other professional advisers;
(3) the directors (together with their close relatives and related trusts) of an
offeror, the offeree company or any company covered in (1);
(4) the pension funds of an offeror, the offeree company or any company covered
in (1);
(5) any investment company, unit trust or other person whose investments an
associate manages on a discretionary basis, in respect of the relevant
investment accounts;
(6) a person who owns or controls 5% or more of any class of relevant securities
(as defined in paragraphs (a) to (d) in Note 2 on Rule 8) issued by an offeror
or an offeree company, including a person who as a result of any transaction
owns or controls 5% or more. When two or more persons act pursuant to an
agreement or understanding (formal or informal) to acquire or control such
Aviva PLC Rule 8.3- RYANAIR HOLDINGS
securities, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of this
paragraph. Such securities managed on a discretionary basis by an investment
management group will, unless otherwise agreed by the Panel, also be deemed to
be those of a single person (see Note 8 on Rule 8); and
(7) a company having a material trading arrangement with an offeror or the
offeree company.
Paragraphs (1)-(7) are typical cases. Paragraph (8) below is a category to cover
associate status not within (1)-(7).
Other.
Notes
* References to a "bank" do not apply to a bank whose sole relationship with a
party to an offer is the provision of normal commercial banking services or such
activities in connection with the offer as confirming that cash is available,
handling acceptances and other registration work.
References to "financial and other professional advisers (including
stockbrokers)", in relation to a party to an offer, do not include an
organisation which has stood down, because of a conflict of interest or
otherwise, from acting for that party in connection with the offer if the
organisation is to have a continuing involvement with that party during the
offer, the Panel must be consulted. Unless the Panel is satisfied that the
involvement is entirely unconnected with the offer, the above exclusion will not
normally apply.
# The normal test for whether a person is controlled by, controls or is under
the same control as another person will be by reference to the definition of
control contained in the Code. There may be other circumstances which the Panel
will regard as giving rise to such a relationship (eg where a majority of the
equity share capital is owned by another person who does not have a majority of
the voting rights); in cases of doubt, the Panel should be consulted.

Form 8 Enclosure
Cantor Fitzgerald Europe is the beneficial owner of 14,767,298 Ryanair Holdings
Plc ordinary shares. 14,541,798 of these shares are held to hedge Contract for
CantorFitzgeraldEuro Rule 8.3- Ryanair Holdings
Differences ("CFD") positions for clients and 100,000 of these shares are held
to hedge Spreadbet positions between Cantor Index Limited and other clients. In
addition we hold 125,500 shares as a proprietary position.
A Long CFD is a product where the client to whom the product is sold is taking a
long economic interest in the underlying share price such that the client can
realise a gain if the price of the underlying securities rises above the
reference price.
A Spread Bet is a product where the client to whom the product is sold can
realise a gain or a loss depending on whether the price of the underlying
security increases above or falls below the reference price. The client's
Spread bet position is described as his "stake". A "stake" is expressed in
pounds (sterling) per "point" and a "point" is the price in pence of the
underlying shares. A client with a "stake" of GBP100 per point will make a gain
of GBP100 for every penny increase in the underlying shares and he/she has an
exposure equivalent to 10,000 shares.
A purchaser of a Spread Bet or a CFD contract will realise a gain if the price
of the underlying security goes up. A seller of a Spread Bet or a CFD contract
will realise a gain if the price of the underlying security goes down.
There are no written or oral agreements between Cantor Fitzgerald Europe and any
clients concerning the control of voting rights in relation to the underlying
shares used to hedge the CFDs and Spreadbets.
The CFD contracts are open-ended and there is no rollover into new contracts.

                                      as the first closing date of the Offer,
                                     unless and until Ryanair in its discretion
                                     shall have extended the initial offer
                                     period, in which case the term "initial
                                     closing date" shall mean the latest time and
                                     date at which the initial offer period, as
                                     so extended by Ryanair, will expire or, if
                                     earlier, the date on which the Offer becomes
                                     or is declared unconditional in all
                                     respects;
                                 v. "initial offer period" means the period from
                                     the date of the Offer Document to and
                                     including the initial closing date;
                                vi. "parent undertaking", "subsidiary
                                     undertaking", "associated undertaking" and
                                     "undertaking" have the meanings given by the
                                     European Communities (Companies: Group
                                     Accounts) Regulations, 1992; and
                                vii. "substantial interest" means an interest
                                     in 20 per cent. or more of the voting equity
                                     capital of an undertaking.
Subject to the requirements of the Panel, Ryanair reserves the right (but shall
be under no obligation) to waive, in whole or in part, all or any of the above
conditions apart from conditions (a), (b), (c) and (d).
The Offer will lapse unless all of the conditions set out above have been
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -9-
fulfilled or (if capable of waiver) waived or, where appropriate, have been
determined by Ryanair to be or to remain satisfied on the day which is 21 days
after the later of the initial closing date, the date on which condition (a) is
fulfilled or such later date as Ryanair may, with the consent of the Panel (to
the extent required) decide. Except for condition (a), Ryanair shall not be
obliged to waive (if capable of waiver) or treat as satisfied any condition by a
date earlier than the latest day for the fulfillment of all conditions referred
to in the previous sentence, notwithstanding that any other condition of the
Offer may at such earlier date have been waived or fulfilled or that there are
at such earlier dates no circumstances indicating that the relevant condition
may not be capable of fulfillment.
To the extent that the Offer would give rise to a concentration with a Community
dimension within the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (the
"Regulation"), the Offer shall lapse if the European Commission initiates
proceedings in respect of that concentration under Article 6(1)(c) of the
Regulation or refers the concentration to a competent authority of a Member
State under Article 9(1) of the Regulation before the first closing date of the
Offer or the date when the Offer becomes or is declared unconditional as to
acceptances, whichever is the later.
If the Offer lapses, it will cease to be capable of further acceptance. Aer
Lingus Shareholders who have already accepted the Offer shall then cease to be
bound by the acceptances delivered on or before the date on which the Offer
lapses.

                   Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley

                                      for
                              Aer Lingus Group plc
Summary
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -2-
The board of Ryanair advises that it has acquired through a wholly owned
subsidiary, Coinside Limited, 84,775,000 Aer Lingus Shares representing
approximately 16 per cent. of the Issued Share Capital of Aer Lingus. The board
of Ryanair now announces its intention to make a Cash Offer of EUR2.80 per Aer
Lingus Share for the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus not
already in the beneficial ownership or control of the Ryanair Group. This Cash
Offer is conditional on, amongst other things, obtaining at least a majority of
the Aer Lingus Shares.
The board of Ryanair believes the Cash Offer represents an excellent price for
Aer Lingus Shares given that only 8 days ago the Government of Ireland, Aer
Lingus and their respective advisers determined that EUR2.20 was an appropriate
price at which to issue and sell Aer Lingus Shares pursuant to the IPO.
The Cash Offer values each Aer Lingus Share at EUR2.80 and values the entire
issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus at approximately
EUR1.481bn. It represents:
   a premium of approximately 27 per cent. over the IPO Price of an Aer
     Lingus Share of EUR2.20 per share; and
   a premium of approximately 12 per cent. over the Closing Price of an Aer
     Lingus Share on 4 October 2006, the last day prior to this announcement, of
     EUR2.51.
In addition, the board of Ryanair notes that the Aer Lingus Share price
appreciation since the IPO occurred during the same short period in which
Ryanair acquired approximately 16 per cent. of Aer Lingus Shares at an average
price of EUR2.42 per Aer Lingus Share which further emphasises the attractiveness
of the Cash Offer. On 2 October and 3 October, days during which Ryanair was not
actively buying Aer Lingus Shares, the price per Aer Lingus Share fell back from
EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
The Cash Offer, which will be made by Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley
on behalf of Ryanair (or a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair), will be subject
to certain conditions set out in Appendix I, including amongst other conditions,
the acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders holding not less than 90 per cent. of
the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus (or such lower
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -2-
percentage as Ryanair may determine, subject always to the Takeover Rules) and
the passing of the Ryanair Shareholder Resolutions at an EGM to be held as soon
as practicable to approve the Cash Offer. In the event that the Offer is
declared unconditional in all respects, Aer Lingus Shareholders who have not
accepted the Offer may experience a reduction in the liquidity of their Aer
Lingus Shares.
Commenting on the Offer, Mr Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive of Ryanair said:
"This Offer represents a unique opportunity to form one strong airline group for
Ireland and for European consumers. We will expand, enhance and upgrade the Aer
Lingus operations. This offer - if successful - means both companies will
continue to operate separately and compete vigorously on the small number of
routes on which we both operate - currently around 17 of the 500 or so routes
operated by the two airlines. We believe the price of EUR2.80 to be an excellent
offer. If accepted the Irish Government will realise over EUR500m from the sale of
their Aer Lingus shares, and the employees will realise over EUR220m which equates
to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee."
The combined strength of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would establish an Irish airline
group with over 50m passengers annually, capable of competing on the European
and World stage against other large European airline groups, including Lufthansa
/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), Air France/KLM (70m passengers) and BA/Iberia (63m
passengers). As the European airline industry consolidates, this acquisition, if
it proceeds, will replicate previous consolidations in France (Air France/Brit
Air/Regionale/KLM), UK (BA/B.Cal/DanAir/City Express), Germany (Lufthansa/
Eurowings/Lufthansa Cityline/Swiss) and Scandinavia (SAS/Braethens).
The board of Ryanair believes there are benefits of combining these two Irish
and European airlines into one group, and to give a flavour of what this offer -
if successful - might mean to Aer Lingus, its stakeholders and the people of
Ireland and Europe, Ryanair intends to:-
   Reduce Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005 (source : IPO
     Prospectus)) by
     2 1/2% a year for a minimum period of four years;
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -2-
   Reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as the price of oil falls from recent
     highs;
   Retain the Aer Lingus brand;
   Retain the Heathrow slots;
   Retain all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus;
   Reduce Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies and Ryanair's
     superior purchasing power;
   Give Aer Lingus access to the benefit of Ryanair's lower cost aircraft
     deliveries and lower cost financing facilities;
   Upgrade Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and improve its long haul
     product;
   Maintain Aer Lingus as a stand alone, separate company within one strong
     Irish airline group under common ownership but run as separate competing
     airlines.
As the above benefits demonstrate, the board of Ryanair intends to deliver a
publicly owned, Irish managed and headquartered airline group with the necessary
ambition, expertise, financial strength and cost base to take on European and
Global competitors well into the future. As an island nation, Ireland is
critically dependent upon strong and secure low fare airline services in order
to sustain and develop tourism and economic growth. Investing in Aer Lingus is
attractive for Ryanair and its shareholders because, amongst other things, Aer
Lingus' earnings yield is superior to the returns currently available on
Ryanair's cash deposits. The board of Ryanair believes that there will be
opportunities (by combining the purchasing power of Ryanair and Aer Lingus) to
reduce operating costs, to increase efficiencies and to pass on these savings in
the form of low fares to the travelling public.
Ryanair has grown to be Europe's largest low fares airline by continuously
lowering prices and funding these reductions through cost savings and
efficiencies. The board of Ryanair believes there is an opportunity to apply
this successful low fares formula to Aer Lingus where currently, in its short
haul operation, fares and costs remain far too high. Ryanair would also expect
to work closely with Aer Lingus, if the offer is successful, to improve its long
haul operations where the board of Ryanair believes there is room to upgrade the
long haul fleet and improve this product which has not kept pace with the
competition in recent years. Since the board of Ryanair envisages that the two
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -2-
companies would be run separately, in the event that the Offer is successful,
nothing in this transaction will deflect Ryanair from continuing to focus on its
own pan-European expansion or from continuing to deliver unit cost reductions
and continuing to offer lower fares to millions of Ryanair's European
passengers.
There are numerous precedents across Europe (in the UK, France, Spain, Germany
and Scandinavia) for two airlines of similar nationality coming together to form
a stronger, more widely diversified airline group. The European Union has
recognised the value of competitive European airline consolidation because of
the benefits which it brings to consumers. Ryanair believes this Offer, if
successful, will result in that precedent being replicated here in Ireland and
elsewhere, with the added benefit that customers of Aer Lingus will enjoy lower
fares in the short haul market, a better product and service in the long haul
market by reducing fuel surcharges as oil prices fall, as Ryanair applies its
philosophy of lower costs and lower fares to Aer Lingus' existing business.
This summary should be read in conjunction with the full text of the following
announcement.

                                   Cash Offer
                                       by
                   Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley

                              Ryanair Holdings plc
                                      for
                              Aer Lingus Group plc
        1. Introduction
The board of Ryanair announces that it has acquired through a wholly owned
subsidiary, Coinside Limited, 84,775,000 Aer Lingus Shares representing
approximately 16 per cent. of the Issued Share Capital of Aer Lingus. The board
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -3-
of Ryanair now announces the terms of a Cash Offer for Aer Lingus to be made by
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley on behalf of Ryanair, for the entire
issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the
beneficial ownership or control of Ryanair. The making of the Cash Offer is
subject to certain conditions set out in Appendix I, including, amongst other
conditions, the acceptance by Aer Lingus Shareholders holding not less than 90
per cent. of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus (or such
lower percentage as Ryanair may determine subject always to the Takeover Rules)
not already in the beneficial ownership or control of Ryanair and the passing of
the Ryanair Shareholder Resolutions at an EGM to be held as soon as practicable
to approve the Offer.
        2. The Cash Offer
On behalf of Ryanair, Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley will offer to
acquire all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Aer Lingus not
already in the beneficial ownership or control of Ryanair, subject to the
conditions and on the terms set out in Appendix I to this announcement and to be
set out in the Offer Document and the related Forms of Acceptance, on the
following basis:
                    EUR2.80 in cash for every Aer Lingus Share
The board of Ryanair believes the Cash Offer represents an excellent price for
Aer Lingus Shares given that only 8 days ago the Government of Ireland, Aer
Lingus and their respective advisers determined that EUR2.20 was an appropriate
price at which to issue and sell Aer Lingus Shares pursuant to the IPO.
The Cash Offer values each Aer Lingus Share at EUR2.80 and values the Issued Share
Capital of Aer Lingus at approximately EUR1.481bn. It represents:
   a premium of approximately 27 per cent. over the IPO Price of an Aer
     Lingus Share of EUR2.20 per share; and
   a premium of approximately 12 per cent. over the Closing Price of an Aer
     Lingus Share on 4 October 2006, the last day prior to the date of this
     announcement, of EUR2.51.
In addition, the board of Ryanair notes that the Aer Lingus Share price
appreciation since the IPO occurred during the same short period in which
Ryanair acquired approximately 16 per cent. of Aer Lingus Shares at an average
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -3-
price of EUR2.42 per Aer Lingus Share, which further emphasises the attractiveness
of the Cash Offer. On 2 October and 3 October, days during which Ryanair was not
actively buying Aer Lingus Shares, the price per Aer Lingus Share fell back from
EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
The Offer will extend to all Aer Lingus Shares (other than those Aer Lingus
Shares already beneficially owned by Ryanair as at the date of the Offer)
unconditionally allotted or issued on the date of the Offer (including Aer
Lingus Shares issued pursuant to the Over Allotment Arrangements), together with
any further such shares which are unconditionally allotted or issued (including
Aer Lingus Shares issued pursuant to the Over Allotment Arrangements) while the
Offer remains open for acceptance or until such earlier date as, subject to the
Takeover Rules, Ryanair may determine.
The Aer Lingus Shares are to be acquired fully paid and free from all liens,
charges and encumbrances, rights of pre-emption and any other third party rights
or interests of any nature whatsoever and together with all rights
attaching thereto including the right to receive all dividends and other
distributions (if any) declared, made or paid thereafter.
The Offer shall be made by Ryanair or a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair.

unconditional in all respects, be despatched not later than 14 days after the
Cash Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects, or thereafter
within 14 days of receipt of acceptance of the Cash Offer.
If Ryanair receives acceptances of the Cash Offer in respect of, and/or
otherwise acquires, 90 per cent. or more of the Aer Lingus Shares to which the
Cash Offer relates (and in the case where the Aer Lingus Shares to which the
Cash Offer relates are voting shares, not less than 90 per cent. of the voting
rights carried by those Aer Lingus Shares) and assuming all other conditions of
the Cash Offer have been satisfied or waived (if they are capable of being
waived), Ryanair intends to exercise its rights pursuant to the provisions of
Regulation 23 of the Takeover Regulations to acquire the remaining Aer Lingus
Shares to which the Cash Offer relates on the same terms as the Cash Offer.
As soon as it is appropriate and possible to do so and subject to the Offer
becoming or being declared unconditional in all respects, and subject to any
applicable requirements of the Irish Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange
or the UK Listing Authority, Ryanair intends to apply for the cancellation of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -5-
the listing of the Aer Lingus Shares on the Irish Stock Exchange and the UK
Official List and for the cancellation of admission to trading of Aer Lingus
Shares on the markets of the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange
and to propose a resolution to re-register Aer Lingus as a private company under
the relevant provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1983. If this
de-listing and cancellation occurs, it will significantly reduce the liquidity
and marketability of any Aer Lingus Shares not assented to the Cash Offer. It is
anticipated that the cancellations will take effect no earlier than 20 Business
Days from either the date Ryanair has acquired 75% of the voting rights in Aer
Lingus or on the first date of issue of compulsory acquisition notices by
Ryanair pursuant to Regulation 23 of the Takeover Regulations.

                             FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
                  REJECTION BY AER LINGUS OF RYANAIR PROPOSAL
The Board of Aer Lingus Group plc ("Aer Lingus Group") notes the announcement by
Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair Holdings") of its intention to make an
unsolicited offer for the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary share
capital of Aer Lingus Group not already owned by Ryanair Holdings at a price of
EUR2.80 per share (the "Offer"). The Board unanimously rejects the Offer.
Aer Lingus is one of Europe's most profitable airlines, with a consistent track
record for generating strong returns on its capital. It is well-positioned to
benefit from numerous growth opportunities relating to both its long and short
haul networks as a result of its strong market position in Ireland and the depth
Aer Lingus Group PLC Rejection of Ryanair Proposal
and experience of its management team.
The Board's detailed views will be sent to shareholders when the formal offer
document has been issued. In the meantime, Aer Lingus Group shareholders are
strongly advised to take no action in relation to the Offer.
Commenting on the Offer, John Sharman, Chairman of Aer Lingus Group, said: "This
approach is unsolicited, wholly opportunistic and significantly undervalues the
Group's businesses and attractive long term growth potential. In addition, the
Offer would raise significant regulatory issues as a result of Aer Lingus
Group's strong position in its core markets."

Ryanair Holdings PLC
05 October 2006
Not for release, publication or distribution, in whole or in part, in or into or
  from Australia, Canada, Japan, South Africa or the United States or any other
                 jurisdiction where it would be unlawful to do so
RYANAIR ADVISES THAT IT HAS ACQUIRED A 16% STAKE IN AER LINGUS AND ANNOUNCES AN
         ALL-CASH OFFER OF EUR2.80 PER SHARE VALUING AER LINGUS AT EUR1.481BN
The board of Ryanair Holdings plc today (5th October 2006) advises that it has
acquired over 16% of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus Group plc. Ryanair
now announces its intention to make an all cash offer of EUR2.80 per share for the
issued share capital of Aer Lingus not already in the ownership of Ryanair. This
offer is conditional on, among other things, obtaining at least a majority of
the shares in Aer Lingus. This cash offer values Aer Lingus at approximately
EUR1.481bn and represents a premium of 27% (approximately) over last week's IPO
share price of EUR2.20 per share and a premium of 12% (approximately) over last
evening's closing price for Aer Lingus shares of EUR2.51.
The share price appreciation since the Aer Lingus IPO occurred during the same
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus
short period in which Ryanair acquired over 16% of Aer Lingus shares at an
average price of EUR2.42 per share. During the 2nd and 3rd of October - the two
days during which Ryanair was not actively buying Aer Lingus shares - the share
price fell back from EUR2.48 to EUR2.41.
Speaking at the launch of the offer this morning, Ryanair's CEO, Michael
O'Leary, said:
        "This offer represents a unique opportunity to form one strong airline
         group for Ireland and for European consumers. We will expand, enhance
         and upgrade the Aer Lingus operations. This offer - if successful -
         means both companies will continue to operate separately and compete
         vigorously in the small number of routes on which we both operate -
         currently around 17 of the approximately 500 routes operated by the two
         airlines. We believe the price of EUR2.80 to be an excellent offer. If
         accepted the Irish Government will realise over EUR500m from the sale of
         their Aer Lingus shares, and the employees will realise over EUR220m which
         equates to an average of over EUR60,000 per employee."
The combined strength of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would establish an Irish airline
group with over 50m passengers annually, capable of competing on the European
and World stage against other large European airline groups, including Lufthansa
/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), Air France/KLM (70m passengers) and BA/Iberia (63m
passengers). As the European airline industry consolidates, this acquisition, if
it proceeds, will largely replicate previous consolidations in, for example,
France (Air France/Brit Air/Regionale/KLM), UK (BA/B.Cal/DanAir/City Express),
Germany (Lufthansa/Eurowings/Lufthansa Cityline/Swiss) and Scandinavia (SAS/
Braethens).
There are benefits of combining these two Irish and European airlines into one
group. To give a flavour of what this offer - if successful - might mean to Aer
Lingus, its stakeholders and the people of Ireland and Europe, Ryanair intends
to:-
   Reduce Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005) by 2 1/2% a
     year for a minimum period of four years;
    Reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as the price of oil falls from recent
     highs;
    Retain the Aer Lingus brand;
    Retain the Heathrow slots;
    Retain all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus;
    Reduce Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies and Ryanair's
     superior purchasing power;
    Give Aer Lingus access to the benefit of Ryanair's lower cost aircraft
     deliveries and lower cost financing facilities;
    Upgrade Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and improve its long haul
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus
     product;
    Maintain Aer Lingus as a stand alone, separate company within one strong
     Irish airline group under common ownership but run as separate competing
     airlines.
As the above benefits demonstrate, the Board of Ryanair intends to deliver a
publicly owned, Irish managed and headquartered airline group with the necessary
ambition, expertise, financial strength and cost base to take on European and
Global competitors well into the future. As an island nation, Ireland is
critically dependant upon strong and secure low fare airline services in order
to sustain and develop tourism and economic growth. Investing in Aer Lingus is
attractive for Ryanair and its shareholders because, amongst other things, Aer
Lingus' earnings yield is superior to the returns currently available on
Ryanair's cash deposits. Ryanair believes that there will be opportunities (by
combining the purchasing power of Ryanair and Aer Lingus) to reduce operating
costs, to increase efficiencies and to pass on these savings in the form of low
fares to the travelling public.
Ryanair has grown to be Europe's largest low fares airline by continuously
lowering prices and funding these reductions through cost savings and
efficiencies. We believe there is an opportunity to apply this successful low
fares formula to Aer Lingus where currently, in its short haul operation, fares
and costs remain far too high. We would also expect to work closely with Aer
Lingus, if the offer is successful, to improve its long haul operations where we
believe there is room to upgrade the long haul fleet and improve this product
which has not kept pace with the competition in recent years. Since we envisage
that the two companies would be run separately, in the event that this offer is
successful, nothing in this transaction will deflect Ryanair from continuing to
focus on its own pan-European expansion or from continuing to deliver unit cost
reductions and continuing to offer lower fares to millions of Ryanair's European
passengers.
There are numerous precedents across Europe (for example, in the UK, France,
Spain, Germany and Scandinavia) for two airlines of similar nationality coming
together to form a stronger, more widely diversified airline group. The European
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus
Union has recognised the value of competitive European airline consolidation
because of the benefits which it brings to consumers. This offer, if successful,
will result in that precedent being largely replicated here in Ireland and
elsewhere, with the added benefit that customers of Aer Lingus will enjoy lower
fares in the short haul market, a better product and service in the long haul
market by reducing fuel surcharges as oil prices fall, as Ryanair applies its
philosophy of lower costs and lower fares to Aer Lingus' existing business.
In accordance with the strict rules which apply to takeovers, Ryanair is limited
in its ability to answer questions in relation to this offer.
This release should be read in conjunction with the full text of the rule 2.5
announcement issued today.
The directors of Ryanair accept responsibility for the information contained in
this announcement other than that relating to Aer Lingus, the Aer Lingus Group,
the directors of Aer Lingus and persons connected with them. To the best of the
knowledge and belief of the directors of Ryanair (who have taken all reasonable
care to ensure that such is the case), the information contained in this
announcement for which they respectively accept responsibility is in accordance
with the facts and does not omit anything likely to affect the import of such
information.

Cash Offer, Ryanair, and Aer Lingus. Generally, the words 'will', 'may',
'should', 'could', 'would', 'can', 'continue', 'opportunity', 'believes',

4. Information on Ryanair
Ryanair operates a low fares scheduled passenger airline serving short-haul,
point-to-point routes in Europe from its bases at Dublin, London (Stansted),
Glasgow (Prestwick), Brussels (Charleroi), Frankfurt (Hahn), Milan (Bergamo),
Stockholm (Skavsta), Rome (Ciampino), Barcelona (Girona), Nottingham East
Midlands, London (Luton), Liverpool, Shannon, Pisa and Cork airports, which
together are referred to as "Ryanair's bases of operations" or "Ryanair's
bases". An additional base at Marseille, France was announced during May 2006
and is expected to commence operations in November 2006. In addition, on
September 19, 2006, Ryanair announced a new base at Bremen, Germany, expected to
commence operations in April 2007. In operation since 1985, Ryanair pioneered
the low fares operating model in Europe under a new management team in the early
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -4-
1990s. As of September 15, 2006, the Company offered over 750 scheduled
short-haul flights per day serving 115 locations throughout Europe, including 24
locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, with an operating fleet of 107
aircraft flying approximately 305 routes.
Ryanair had a turnover and operating profit before taxation of EUR1,692,530,000
and EUR375,046,000 respectively for the year ended 31 March, 2006.
Aggregate expenditure by Ryanair to acquire its approximate 16 per cent.
interest in Aer Lingus was over EUR204.8m (excluding expenses), all of which was
funded from the cash reserves of Ryanair.
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley are acting as financial advisers to
Ryanair.
5. Reasons for the Offer and Ryanair's Strategy for Aer Lingus
The directors of Ryanair believe that the combination of Aer Lingus and Ryanair
will create a highly efficient, pro-consumer and, above all, vigorously
competitive airline delivering lower fares for consumers.
Aer Lingus's offering on both its short-haul and long-haul routes, including its
key strategic slots in Heathrow, will complement Ryanair's different type of
offering on its rapidly growing trans-European network.
The combined strength of Ryanair and Aer Lingus would establish an Irish airline
group with over 50m passengers annually, capable of competing on the European
and World stage against other large European airline groups, including Lufthansa
/SAS/Swiss (75m passengers), Air France/KLM (70m passengers) and BA/Iberia (63m
passengers). As the European airline industry consolidates, this acquisition, if
it proceeds, will replicate previous consolidations in France (Air France/Brit
Air/Regionale/KLM), UK (BA/B.Cal/DanAir/City Express), Germany (Lufthansa/
Eurowings/Lufthansa Cityline/Swiss) and Scandinavia (SAS/Braethens).
The board of Ryanair believes that there are benefits of combining these two
Irish and European airlines into one group, and to give a flavour of what this
offer - if successful - might mean to Aer Lingus, its stakeholders and the
people of Ireland and Europe, Ryanair intends to:-
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -4-
   Reduce Aer Lingus' average short haul fare (EUR87.55 in 2005 (source : IPO
     Prospectus)) by
     2 1/2% a year for a minimum period of four years;
   Reduce Aer Lingus' fuel surcharges as the price of oil falls from recent
     highs;
   Retain the Aer Lingus brand;
   Retain the Heathrow slots;
   Retain all profitable routes currently operated by Aer Lingus;
   Reduce Aer Lingus' costs through improved efficiencies and Ryanair's
     superior purchasing power;
   Give Aer Lingus access to the benefit of Ryanair's lower cost aircraft
     deliveries and lower cost financing facilities;
   Upgrade Aer Lingus' transatlantic fleet and improve its long haul
     product;
   Maintain Aer Lingus as a stand alone, separate company within one strong
     Irish airline group under common ownership but run as separate competing
     airlines.
As the above benefits demonstrate, the board of Ryanair intends to deliver a
publicly owned, Irish managed and headquartered airline group with the necessary

global competitors well into the future. As an island nation, Ireland is
critically dependent upon strong and secure low fare airline services in order

Ryanair has grown to be Europe's largest low fares airline by continuously

this successful low fares formula to Aer Lingus where currently, in its short
haul operation, fares and costs remain far too high. Ryanair would also expect
to work closely with Aer Lingus, if the offer is successful, to improve its long
haul operations where the board of Ryanair believes there is room to upgrade the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -4-
long haul fleet and improve this product which has not kept pace with the
competition in recent years. Since the board of Ryanair envisages that the two
companies would be run separately, in the event that the Offer is successful,
nothing in this transaction will deflect Ryanair from continuing to focus on its
own pan-European expansion or from continuing to deliver unit cost reductions
and continuing to offer lower fares to millions of Ryanair's European
passengers.

reducing fuel surcharges as oil prices fall, as Ryanair applies its philosophy
of lower costs and lower fares to Aer Lingus' existing business.
6. Financing
The Offer will be financed from the cash reserves of Ryanair.
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley confirm that they are satisfied that
resources are available to Ryanair sufficient to satisfy full acceptance of the
Offer.
7. Employees
Following the Cash Offer becoming or being declared unconditional in all
respects, the existing employment rights of the management and employees of the
Aer Lingus Group will be safeguarded in accordance with statutory requirements.
However, Ryanair would expect to continue the effective rationalisation
programme followed by Aer Lingus in recent years.
8. Ryanair Shareholder approval
In view of the size of Aer Lingus relative to Ryanair, amongst other conditions
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -4-
to the Cash Offer (as set out in Appendix I), the approval of Ryanair
shareholders at an EGM is required in accordance with the Listing Rules of The
Irish Stock Exchange and the UK Listing Authority. An ordinary resolution of
Ryanair shareholders will be proposed to approve, implement and effect the Offer
by Ryanair and to authorise the directors of Ryanair to do all such things as
they consider necessary or appropriate in connection with the Offer.
9. Offer Document
The Offer Document, containing the full terms and conditions of the Offer, will
be posted as soon as practicable to Aer Lingus Shareholders.
10. Disclosure of Interests in Aer Lingus
As at the close of business on 4 October, 2006, being the latest practicable day
prior to the date of this announcement, parties acting in concert with Ryanair
owned 85,034,469 Aer Lingus Shares representing approximately 16 per cent. of
the existing issued ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus. All such Aer Lingus
Shares are owned by Coinside Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair
except for 259,469 Aer Lingus Shares which are held by an affiliate of Davy
Corporate Finance on its own account and on behalf of certain discretionary
clients.
Save for these interests, neither Ryanair, nor the directors of Ryanair, nor any
party acting in concert with Ryanair, owns or controls any Aer Lingus Shares or
holds any options to acquire or subscribe for any Aer Lingus Shares or any
derivative referenced to Aer Lingus Shares.
Neither Ryanair nor any persons acting in concert with Ryanair has any
arrangement in relation to Aer Lingus Shares, or any securities convertible or
exchangeable into Aer Lingus Shares or options (including traded options) in
respect of, or derivatives referenced to, Aer Lingus Shares. For these purposes,
'arrangement' includes an indemnity or option arrangement, any agreement or
understanding, formal or informal, of whatever nature, relating to relevant
securities which is, or may be, an inducement to deal or refrain from dealing in
such securities.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Lingus -4-
11. Regulatory Issues
Having taken legal advice, the board of Ryanair is confident that any regulatory
aspects relating to the consummation of the Offer are capable of being
successfully dealt with.
12. Settlement, Compulsory Acquisition, De-listing and Re-registration
The consideration will, in relation to Aer Lingus Shareholders who validly
accept the Cash Offer up to the time the Cash Offer becomes or is declared

Ryanair Holdings PLC
29 September 2006
                     RYANAIR RAISES NET PROFIT GUIDANCE AND
                BUYS 32 BOEING 737 800s - VALUE OVER $2 BILLION
        Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Friday, 29th
         September 2006) raised its full year Net Profit guidance to
         approximately EUR335M (+11%), up from the +5% to +10% previously guided.
         Ryanair also announced the order of a further 32 Boeing 737-800 series
         aircraft, bringing the total number of firm orders for Boeing 737-800s
         to 281.
        These 32 next generation 737-800 aircraft are due for delivery between
         September 2008 and June 2009 and will facilitate double digit annual
         growth from 42M passengers this year to 84M passengers in 2012 as
         Ryanair doubles in size and becomes Europe's largest international
         airline. These firm orders are the conversion of options agreed with
         Boeing in 2005 at prices that give Ryanair the lowest per seat operating
         cost of any European airline.
        Announcing this increased guidance and firm order today in New York,
         Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
            "Our outlook for this winter remains cautious. This winter we will
             launch 106 new routes and 2 new bases (Marseilles and Bremen). We
             have also hedged our fuel requirements for Q4 at an average cost of
             $73 per barrel, lower than we had originally anticipated.
            "Based on our aircraft delivery programme, our new routes and bases,
             we anticipate that passenger growth will be slightly higher at 22%
Ryanair Holdings PLC Raises Net Profit Guidance
             (previously 20%) to 42.5m for the full year. We anticipate that our
             loss making competitors will continue to dump fares. We also expect
             slightly lower load factors (down 2% on last year) during H2 which
             will give improved yield stability in the winter period. This will
             result in the decline in forecast yields being closer to 5% which is
             at the lower end of the (-5% to -10%) range we previously guided.
            "As a result of these factors we believe that the increase in Net
             Profit after Tax for the fiscal year will be approximately 11% to
             EUR335m, slightly higher than our previous (+5% to +10%) range of
             profit guidance.
            "This further purchase of 32 Boeing 737 800 aircraft is great news
             for European passengers who will now enjoy even more low fare routes
             as we double in size to 84M passengers per annum by 2012.
            "These aircraft are equipped with all of the latest technological
             advances in engine type, aerodynamics and blended winglets which
             ensure maximum fuel efficiency and have allowed Ryanair to reduce
             fuel burn by 45% and cut CO2 emissions by 50% per seat. This order
             will also create over 1,500 new highly paid jobs at our 17 bases
             across Europe.
            "Ryanair operates the youngest fleet of aircraft of any major
             airline in Europe and the outstanding reliability and lowest
             operating costs of the Boeing 737 800 aircraft mean that many more
             passengers will enjoy Ryanair's lowest fares and best punctuality".

        "Ryanair's Barcelona base has performed very strongly this summer and
         has firmly established itself as an important driver of both tourism and
         business in the region. Today's 17 new route announcements will allow
         Catalan passengers to enjoy the lowest fares and best punctuality to
         even more destinations. Ryanair now connects Barcelona to 40
         destinations, delivering 4M passengers p.a. and sustaining 4,000 Catalan
         jobs.
        "As part of this expansion, Ryanair will also add a 3rd daily flight on
         its routes to Paris, Milan and Rome which will increase to 1M passengers
         per annum the number of passengers travelling from Barcelona with
         Ryanair to these cities alone.
        "Ryanair's 17 new routes will significantly expand the Catalan region's
         catchment area and our low fares and no fuel surcharge guarantee will
         deliver millions of additional visitors who were previously put off
         coming to the region by the prohibitively high fares charged by Iberia.
        "These new routes are available for booking today from just EUR10 on
         www.ryanair.com and we advise passengers to book early as demand will be
         very strong".
Mr. Manel Nadal, Secretary General for Transport of the Catalan region said:
        "Ryanair's decision to add 4 aircraft and 17 routes to its base in
         Girona is great news and will act as a powerful catalyst to drive
         tourism and business in the whole area of influence covered by Girona
         airport".

          RYANAIR OFFERS TO BUILD TERMINAL 2 AT NO COST TO DAA
               REMOVES NEED FOR 25% PASSENGER TAX INCREASES
Ryanair, Europe's largest international airline, today (Tuesday, 26th September
2006) confirmed that it had written to the DAA offering to build a low cost,
efficient Terminal 2 at Dublin Airport at a cost of EUR250 million. This new
facility will save the DAA the EUR610 million they propose wasting on their
Terminal 2, as well as saving the seven year old Pier C (which cost EUR150
million) and the historic listed building, Corballis House. Ryanair also
confirmed that it would be oppose the DAA's planned Terminal 2, which is badly
designed, in the wrong location, is five times more expensive than other similar
terminal facilities in the UK and Europe, and has ballooned in cost from EUR170
million (when first announced by the DAA in September 2005) to EUR750 million when
the DAA's plans were finally revealed in August 2006.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Offers to Build Terminal 2
Ryanair criticised the DAA's record of building wasteful, inefficient, over
priced facilities, which includes:
     EUR180m on a 3 million passenger terminal at Cork.
      EUR150m on the 7 year old Pier C which they now propose to scrap
       altogether.
      EUR150m on the Terminal One extension which was opened in 2002 and designed
       for 20m. passengers but is patently unable to cope with 20 million
       passengers.
The DAA's proposed T2 location in a cul de sac, on the south side of the airport
is the worst possible location in the context of the proposed second (Northern)
runway at Dublin Airport. This will cause severe congestion and delays to
aircraft and long taxi times between the two terminals and the two runways. The
DAA's T2 design is also nonsensical. They propose two buildings instead of one,
and a five storey building when only two levels are necessary.
Ryanair today confirmed that it would oppose the DAA's proposed Terminal 2. It
will submit objections at the planning stage to Fingal County Council. Ryanair
will also be opposing any attempt by the DAA to seek an unnecessary and
unjustified 25% increase in passenger charges to the CAR. Ryanair will also be
submitting a complaint to the Competition Authority calling for an investigation
into the fourfold increase in T2 costs, which have risen from EUR170m in September
2005 to EUR750m in August 2006, just eleven months later. Ryanair also confirmed
it will submit a complaint to the European Commission against the DAA for abuse
of its monopoly position at Dublin Airport which has resulted in the T2 costs
rising fourfold even before planning has been applied for, and for forcing
consumers to pay for a second terminal when more than half (20m) of the
passengers at Dublin Airport will never use it.
Speaking today at Ryanair's Press Conference, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary
said:
        "The DAA cannot be trusted to build efficient, low cost facilities.
         Having wasted EUR150m. on Pier C in 1998 they now propose to scrap it.
         Having spent a further EUR150m. extending the Terminal in 2002 "to cater
         for 20 million passengers" this Summer's experience has proven that the
         facilities cannot handle 20 million passengers. Having announced the
         second terminal in August 2005 at a cost of EUR170m. the DAA have now
         designed this facility and the costs have exploded twelve months later
         to over EUR750m. It makes no sense to build a two building terminal when
         one building is more than adequate. It's nonsensical to build a five
         storey building when a two storey building will do.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Offers to Build Terminal 2
        "These costs increases, and the proposed 25% to 60% increase in
         passenger taxes are a direct result of this Government's breach of its
         promise of an independent second terminal at Dublin Airport. Ryanair has
         offered to build a low cost efficient second terminal at not cost to the
         DAA, and the Ryanair building is in a better location for the second
         runway and is a more passenger friendly design.
        "When there is an alternative T2 proposal which can be built at no cost
         to the DAA, and can be built with no increase in passenger taxes at
         Dublin Airport, Ryanair calls on the Government to ensure that this is
         the facility that is developed at Dublin Airport and to scrap the EUR760m.
         Taj Mahal proposed by the DAA.
        "The DAA wasted EUR300m on Dublin Airport to deliver a facility which
         could handle 20m. passengers, but it plainly failed to do so. They
         wasted a further EUR180m. on a 3m facility in Cork when it could and
         should have been built for one tenth of this sum. Passengers and
         visitors at Dublin Airport should not endure Third World facilities, or
         suffer 25% to 60% cost increases to pay for the waste and incompetence
         of the failed DAA monopoly".

Ryanair's new base in Bremen is great news for business and tourism in the
region, which will benefit from 9 year round low fare routes and up to 1 M
passengers p.a. This will result in a 50% increase in Bremen's international
passenger numbers and will create and sustain 1,000 jobs in the region while
allowing consumers to enjoy savings of EUR100M compared to the high fares of
Lufthansa.
Announcing Ryanair's 17th European base in Bremen, Michael O'Leary said:
        "The 13M German consumers living in the Bremen catchment area will now
         enjoy a real low fares airline and unbeatable customer service with
         fares for less than half the price of Lufthansa to 9 exciting European
         destinations and a guarantee of no fuel surcharges as well.
        "Our message to the German high fare airlines is simple - You can't
         match Ryanair's low fares and you can't match Ryanair's punctuality and
         customer service either. Ryanair's base in Bremen will now replicate the
         enormous success of our Frankfurt Hahn base where Ryanair has grown to
         4M passengers p.a. within 6 years and will double again to 8M passengers
         in the next 6 years as a result of German consumers and visitors voting
         with their feet for the lowest fares and best punctuality in Germany.
        "To celebrate the launch of these new routes we are offering 50,000
         seats from Bremen for EUR1 for travel in May and June. These bargain seats
         can be booked on www.ryanair.com until midnight Thursday and we advise
         passengers to book today as demand for EUR1 seats will be very strong".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
07 September 2006
                   RYANAIR ANNOUNCES FIRST ROUTES FROM MALTA,
                         ITS 24th COUNTRY OF OPERATION
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, today (Thursday, 7th September
2006), announced the commencement of three new routes to Malta International
Airport from London Luton, Pisa and Dublin. These routes are a direct response
to the Maltese Government's initiative to attract low fare airlines to the
island. The Government has accepted in full Ryanair's proposals and the airline
is now confirming the commencement dates and frequency of these services.
Ryanair, on a year round basis, will fly a daily service from London Luton
starting on the 31st October 2006, a three times weekly service from Pisa
starting on the 31st October 2006 and a three times weekly service from Dublin,
which commences on the 9th February 2007.
Commenting on the announcement of the new routes, Ryanair's Deputy Chief
Ryanair Holdings PLC First Routes To Malta
Executive, Michael Cawley said:
        "Ryanair is delighted to announce these new routes to Malta, which we
         hope will be the commencement of a long and growing relationship with
         the island. The Government has shown courage and initiative in inviting
         proposals from low cost airlines and we are delighted to have succeeded
         with our plans for these three new routes. We believe this will reverse
         the decline in Maltese tourism. As an island economy with over 20% of
         its GNP dependant on tourism, low cost access is crucial and the Maltese
         Government has taken the first tentative steps towards a major
         breakthrough in this regard.
        "Ryanair will carry over 200,000 passengers in the first year on these
         three routes with over 110,000 passengers expected on the London Luton
         routes, 47,000 each from Pisa and Dublin. We expect to carry over 85,000
         tourists into the country bringing total revenue of in excess of EUR36m in
         related spend, resulting in the creation of 300 new jobs directly and
         indirectly at Malta International Airport. These passengers will save
         over EUR20m as against the average fares charged by high fare airlines to
         and from the island.
        "Our fares will undercut those of the existing high fare operators by up
         to 90% (net of taxes and charges) and we will immediately include all
         these routes in our existing free seat sale in, which over 4 million
         seats are made available for flying from October to March at zero fares
         with the passengers having to pay just the taxes and charges".

        "For the lowest fares Ryanair is No.1 and when it comes to NO FARES, we
         leave other airlines on the ground. Other airlines might talk low fares,
         but only Ryanair actually delivers them and as this fantastic 4,000,000
         FREE seat sale demonstrates - it's no fares!
        "Our new routes and doubled frequencies from Dublin will extend
         Ryanair's leadership over Aer Lingus. Where there is a choice passengers
         always prefer Ryanair's low fare, on-time services to Aer Lingus' high
         fare usually late flights. These new routes will replicate between
         Dublin and Europe the clear preference that Irish passengers and
         visitors have already shown for Ryanair over Aer Lingus between Ireland
         and the UK where choice has existed for many years. Aer Lingus'
         inability to compete will consign it to a future role of high cost niche
         market regional carrier, as Ryanair strengthens its position as
         Ireland's national airline.
        "There has never been a better time to snap up a FREE flight on any of
         Ryanair's 371 routes for travel up until March 2007. Passengers who want
         to book a FREE flight should log on now to www.ryanair.com as these 4M

BAA PLC

BAA rejects break-up calls
BAA today dismissed calls for the break-up of its UK airports, arguing that a
more fragmented ownership structure would undermine vitally needed investment in
airport capacity.
In a submission to the Office of Fair Trading study on the UK Airports market,
BAA urged the OFT to focus upon the true interests of consumers.
Stephen Nelson, BAA's Chief Executive said: "I fully understand why airlines
like British Airways and Ryanair want to weaken airport operators and achieve
greater control over prices and investment at the airports where they hold such
powerful positions themselves, but the job of the competition authorities is to
protect the longer term interests of all consumers.
"The biggest problem facing UK air travellers is the shortage of airport
capacity, especially in South East England. Failure to build new runway capacity
BAA PLC BAA rejects break-up calls
will lead to gridlock, disappointed customers and significant loss to the
national economy
"Despite this, some airlines want to break up BAA and impose even heavier price
regulation. This have-it-both-ways proposal would be a poisonous cocktail for
consumers. It risks setting back the much needed investment programme which BAA
is pursuing, to transform London's airports through projects like Heathrow
Terminal 5, Heathrow East and the Stansted second runway."
BAA's final submission to the OFT argues that the airports market is highly
imperfect because most people use the airport closest to where they live, or
which offers flights to their preferred destination. The market is also
distorted by many unusual factors, such as airport slot allocation procedures
and inter-governmental agreements on air services.
BAA says that the threat to investment from break-up will outweigh any possible
benefits to consumers in terms of choice, price or quality of service. BAA's UK
airports are already among the cheapest in Europe in terms of landing charges,
which are heavily subsidised by BAA's retail activities and regulated by the
Civil Aviation Authority.
Stephen Nelson added: "We are not saying that the current situation is perfect
and we welcome the OFT's review, so long as it is wide-ranging and
evidence-based. The OFT needs to consider regulation as well as ownership
structures. The evidence suggests that BAA has done a good job since
privatisation, in terms of security and safety; capacity; quality of service and
price."

          RYANAIR ANNOUNCES IN FLIGHT MOBILE ACCESS FOR ALL PASSENGERS
    New venture with communications pioneer OnAir will enable Ryanair's 42M
                    passengers to keep in touch on all flights
                INFLIGHT PHONE SEAT SALE 1M SEATS - DIAL GBP9.99!
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, and OnAir, the leading onboard
passenger communications provider, today (Wednesday, 30th August 2006) announced
a deal that will see Ryanair's entire fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft fitted with
OnAir's onboard mobile communications solution. The announcement will make
Ryanair the first European airline to offer Europe-wide mobile telephony
services during flights across its entire fleet of aircraft to all passengers
via their own mobile phones and smartphones.
The deal means that from mid 2007 (subject to relevant regulatory approval)
Ryanair's passengers will be able to call, text and e-mail using their mobile
phones, BlackBerrysTM and TreosTM at rates which will mirror international
Ryanair Holdings PLC In Flight Mobile Access
roaming charges. OnAir intend to fit 50 Ryanair aircraft during the second half
of 2007, with the remainder of the fleet receiving installations from early 2008
onwards. Mobile OnAir will be offered on all Ryanair flights across Ryanair's
network of more than 360 routes serving 23 countries across Europe. Ryanair will
be the first European airline to offer this mobile telephony to all passengers
on all of its 200 plus aircraft fleet.
Developed by inflight communications specialist OnAir, Mobile OnAir uses
advanced lightweight onboard technology to allow passengers to make and receive
calls, exchange SMS messages and connect to e-mail via satellite broadband links
and a ground network to be supplied by OnAir's telecoms infrastructure partner,
Monaco Telecom.
OnAir's solution allows mobile phone operators to charge passengers using Mobile
OnAir at rates in line with current international roaming charges on passengers'
normal monthly bills. Ryanair will receive a commission from OnAir on call
revenues generated by passengers on board its aircraft.
Announcing the new service initiative, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, said:
        "This is another revolutionary passenger service initiative from
         Ryanair. In addition to offering our customers the lowest air fares and
         youngest fleet of aircraft, Ryanair will soon enable passengers to use
         their mobile phones and electronic communications devices in the air,
         just as they do on the ground. That means they will be able to pass on
         the good news to workmates, friends and family that they are travelling
         on another on-time flight with Europe's most punctual airline.
        "This is a win-win for Ryanair, OnAir and most importantly our
         customers. The revenues generated by onboard mobile telephony will
         reduce our costs and help us to keep offering the lowest fares in Europe
         while at the same time doubling the size of our operation over the next
         five years as we grow to carry 80M passengers annually by 2012. To
         celebrate this new service, we are offering 1M seats from the UK to
         Europe for just GBP9.99*. Passengers should dial up their low fare seats
         immediately on www.ryanair.com as fares this low will not last long ".
George Cooper, CEO of OnAir, added:
        "We are delighted that Ryanair is to become the first carrier to install
         Mobile OnAir throughout its fleet. Not only is Ryanair one of the
         world's most innovative airlines, but the deal is also a strong
         endorsement of the all round capability of our solution for both Boeing
         and Airbus aircraft".

                      "WE MUST NOT BE MOVED BY TERRORISTS"
RYANAIR CALLS ON UK DfT TO SHOW LEADERSHIP AND RESTORE AIRPORT SECURITY TO IATA
                                      NORMS
          SUBMITS GBP3M. COMPENSATION CLAIM - PROCEEDS TO GO TO CHARITY
               RELEASES 1m. SEATS AT 99p. TO KEEP BRITAIN FLYING
Ryanair, the UK's largest passenger airline, today (Friday, 25th August 2006)
repeated its call for the UK Government to adopt the same defiant response it
took after the 7/7 London Underground attack, by not giving in to terrorism, and
restore UK airport security to the same IATA norms that are followed at every
other European international airport, and on every inbound flight to the UK.
Ryanair reconfirmed that the "additional" security measures introduced by the
DfT are ineffective and are - according to the BAA - "unsustainable". These
measures achieve nothing other than give rise to large queues, frequent delays
and will result in further flight cancellations over the coming busy August Bank
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair GBP 3m Comp Claim
Holiday weekend.
Ryanair highlighted that these "additional" security measures are nonsensical
and ineffective, as follows:
        1. The reduced carry on luggage limits apply only to outbound UK
         flights, but not to UK inbound flights. In security terms, this is
         illogical.
        2. Reducing the carry on luggage limits to a "large briefcase" when the
         internationally accepted IATA carry on bag is only 20% greater, does not
         add in any way to airport or aircraft security. A large briefcase is no
         more or less safe that the IATA standard carry on bag, all of which are
         processed through the same airport X-Ray security machines. In security
         terms, this is nonsensical.
        3. The continuing requirement to body search every second passenger
         passing through UK airport X-Ray security machines (instead of the
         normal one in four) means that many families, elderly couples and young
         children are now being body searched as potential terrorists and
         extremists. This is patently nonsensical. The hard pressed and
         overworked security staff should not be wasting time body searching
         passengers who are patently not terrorists or extremist suspects. In
         security terms, this is ineffective and unnecessary. The BAA airports
         have admitted that these additional security measures are unsustainable.
        4. The policy of confiscating bottles, cosmetics and toiletries at UK
         airport security points, has no effect on aircraft security,
         particularly when all passengers are then allowed to buy these products
         again in duty free and bring them on board UK outbound aircraft. In
         security terms, this makes no sense whatsoever. If as the Department for
         Transport claims, British citizens are really in danger from toiletries,
         cosmetics and liquids, then they should be banning these products in
         airport duty frees, as well as on board inbound UK flights, the London
         Underground and on Eurotunnel as well.
Calling for the UK Government to show some leadership, and restore UK airport
security to the IATA norm, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
        "Ryanair has released another 1 million seats for sale on our website at
         just 99 pence (plus taxes) to keep Britain flying. Sadly the UK DfT is
         doing nothing to restore normality. The longer these additional, yet
         nonsensical and ineffective security measures remain at the UK airports,
         then the more UK passengers and visitors will suffer unnecessary
         queuing, delays and flight cancellations. The DfT is undermining the
         credibility of UK airport security and pandering to the extremists by
         continuing to require these nonsensical and ineffective measures. The
         DfT has failed to explain how these measures add to or improve airport
         security.
        "We should not be moved - the way to defeat terrorism is to get back to
         normal. It is a pity that the UK Government has so far failed to adopt
         the same rock solid approach it took when it successfully restored the
         London Underground to normal within two days of the 7/7 attacks. It is
         now two weeks since the Government successfully averted the alleged
         terrorist/extremist attack at the UK airports, and it is time to return
         UK airports security to the same IATA norms which apply at every other
         international European airport, and which have successfully prevented a
         terrorist/extremist attack at a UK airport or a UK aircraft for over 25
         years. Sadly the DfT, by failing to return airport security to normal,
         is handing the extremists an undeserved and unnecessary victory!.
        "We have today submitted a claim for compensation to the UK Department
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair GBP 3m Comp Claim
         for Transport under Section 93 of the Transport Act 2000. The value of
         the claim is just over GBP3m. and reflects Ryanair's losses from
         cancellations and lost bookings over the week of 10-16 August only. The
         purpose of this claim is to encourage the DfT to restore UK airport
         security to the effective IATA norm, and to prevent similar breakdowns
         at UK airports during future security scares by putting in the necessary
         police and army personnel to carry out the extra security checks
         whenever the Government decides to double or quadruple them again,
         without notice.
        "As Ryanair's sole motive in this action is to defeat terrorism by
         returning airport security to normal, and since we don't wish to be seen
         to profit in any way from suing the Government, all proceeds received
         from a successful claim under the 2000 Transport Act will be donated to
         Ryanair's nominated charity, Orbis, which is fighting to eliminate
         avoidable blindness in the developing world by operating the world's
         only flying eye hospital (www.orbis.org.uk)".

18 August 2006
                    RYANAIR RELEASES 1 MILLION GBP25 SEAT SALE
                            FOR AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER
                              CALLS ON GOVERNMENT
                    TO RESTORE NORMAL SECURITY RESTRICTIONS
                        "LET'S GET BRITAIN FLYING AGAIN"
Ryanair, Britain's largest passenger airline, this morning (Friday, 18th August
2006) announced that it has released 1 million seats for sale on over 100 routes
from the UK to Europe, for travel during August and September. These seats which
are priced at GBP25 one way (including all taxes, fees and charges) can be bought
just three days in advance of travel, at these lowest ever peak Summer fares.
Ryanair is releasing these cheap seats to get Britain flying again, which is the
best way to defeat terrorists and extremists.
Ryanair also confirmed this morning that they have written to the Secretary of
State for Transport, asking him to immediately restore the security measures at
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1M GBP25 Seat Sale Aug & Sept
Britain's airports to the IATA "normal" standards in order to get Britain's
airports and airlines moving again. Whilst airports and schedules are returning
to normal in recent days, this is mainly due to emergency rosters and overtime
being operated by airport security staff. The extraordinary efforts of these
people are not sustainable and the only way to prove to the terrorists that they
cannot disrupt British life is to return the airport security requirements to
their safe pre-9 August levels. This will involve:
        1. Restoring the hand luggage allowance for passengers leaving British
         airports to the normal IATA dimensions of a small wheelie case, which is
         just 20% larger than the current restriction of a "large briefcase"
         dimension. There is no difference in security whatsoever between a large
         briefcase and a small carry on wheelie bag.
        2. Returning the passenger body searches from the current one in two to
         the normal one in four which still allows any suspect flights or suspect
         passengers to be individually body searched. This will reduce the
         pressure on security staff as well as eliminating the queues and delays
         at British airports security points.
        3. Ryanair has also asked for the Transport Minister's assurance that
         the next time the Government quadruples the number of individual body
         searches, that they will send in police and army reserve personnel to
         help carry out these additional searches. This will at least allow the
         increased security to be carried out, in an emergency, without the
         disruptions, delays and cancellations that have characterised the chaos
         at London airports over the past week.
Ryanair has confirmed to the Secretary of State for Transport that if the
Government restores the security at British airports to these normal IATA levels
within the next seven days then it will not make any claim for compensation,
which it is entitled to, under the provisions of Section 93 of the Transport Act
2000.
Announcing today's seat sale in London Stansted, Ryanair's Chief Executive,
Michael O'Leary said:
        "The best way to defeat terrorists and extremists is for ordinary people
         to continue to live their lives as normal. Because of the additional
         security restrictions imposed by the Government last Thursday, the
         shambles at the London airports has been anything but normal.
        "The UK Government successfully led the return to normality of the
         London Underground within two days of the 7/7 terrorist attacks. It is
         important that they now restore security at the London airports to
         normality and remove some of these nonsensical, and (from a security
         perspective) totally ineffective restrictions which were introduced last
         week. If they don't, and if they allow these restrictions stay in place,
         then the Government will have handed the extremists an enormous PR
         victory.
        "Ryanair, by releasing 1 million seats for sale at just GBP25 one way for
         travel during the remainder of August and September, is playing its part
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1M GBP25 Seat Sale Aug & Sept
         to encourage British people to keep flying, and more importantly,
         encourage British visitors to come to London, which is the best message
         we can send to the extremists namely, that we will not allow the
         economic life of Britain to be disrupted by their mindless and senseless
         activities.
        "The 1 million seats at these low prices are available for sale for one
         week only at www.ryanair.com, and I urge everyone to defeat terrorism,
         book early and keep Britain flying".

   RYANAIR ANNOUNCES BIGGEST EVER EXPANSION AT DUBLIN 12 NEW EUROPEAN ROUTES
                                  START FROM DECEMBER
Ryanair, Ireland's largest airline, today (Wednesday, 9th August 2006) unveiled
a significant expansion of its European operations at Dublin Airport. From
December, Ryanair will base three new aircraft in Dublin Airport, create over
200 jobs, and start services on twelve new routes from Dublin to points all over
Europe. The new schedule of routes is as follows:
       Destination                       Starts         Frequency
Oslo (Norway)                              Dec            Daily
Madrid (Spain)                             Feb            Daily
Tampere (Finland)                          Dec            Four Weekly
Vitoria (Spain)                            Jan            Four Weekly
Billund (Denmark)                          Jan            Four Weekly
Bologna (Italy)                            Feb            Four Weekly

Friedrichshafen (Germany)                  Dec            Three Weekly
Ryanair Holdings PLC 12 New European Routes
Seville (Spain)                            Jan            Three Weekly
Pula (Croatia)                             Feb            Three Weekly
Almeria (Spain)                            Jan            Two Weekly
Rzeszow (Poland)                           Jan            Two Weekly
These new destinations start in December 2006 and will be served by Ryanair on a
year round basis. They bring to 63 the number of UK and European routes served
by Ryanair from Dublin and completes Ryanair's displacement of Aer Lingus as the
national carrier of Ireland, as demonstrated by the following facts:
1. Ryanair carries 42M pax annually, five times more than Aer Lingus' 8M.
2. Ryanair offers more routes from Dublin to the UK (18) than Aer Lingus (7).
 3. Ryanair offers more routes from Dublin to Europe (45) than Aer Lingus
     (28).
 4. Ryanair offers double the routes from Irl to UK&EUR (102) than Aer Lingus
     (51).
 5. Ryanair carries 50% more passengers to/from Ireland (12M) than Aer Lingus
     (8M).
6. Ryanair's av. fare is EUR41. Aer Lingus's av. Eur fare is 60% higher @ EUR67.
 7. Ryanair beats Aer Lingus on punctuality, fewer cancellations and fewer
     lost bags.
8. Ryanair brings more visitors to Dublin and Ireland than Aer Lingus.
Announcing these new routes in Dublin this morning, Ryanair's CEO Michael
O'Leary said:
"Move over Aer Lingus! Ryanair is now Ireland's national airline and Aer
Lingus is just a distant number 2. Passengers prefer Ryanair because we
give them lower fares, many more destinations to the UK and Europe and a
better passenger service in terms of newer aircraft, better punctuality,
fewer cancellations and fewer lost bags.
"On every route where there they have a choice, millions more passengers
prefer Ryanair to Aer Lingus. Today's twelve new routes will end Aer
Lingus' high fare monopoly to destinations such as Madrid, Bologna,
Almeria and Seville. Irish passengers who previously had no alternative
to Aer Lingus' high fares and frequent delays on these routes will now
have a low fare, on-time option with Ryanair. Irish passengers will also
enjoy Ryanair's low fares to new European destinations such as Norway
Ryanair Holdings PLC 12 New European Routes
(Oslo Torp), Denmark (Billund), Finland (Tampere) and Eastern Poland
(Rzeszow) which are not currently served by Aer Lingus.
        "This year Ryanair will carry 42 million passengers across its network.
         This is five times more than the annual, 8M traffic of Aer Lingus.
         Ryanair also carries 50% more passengers than Aer Lingus to/from
         Ireland. The Irish people have voted with their feet and made Ryanair
         Ireland's number one airline. In the process Aer Lingus has been
         displaced as Ireland's national airline and now survives as just a
         distant number 2.
        "In 2007, Ryanair will deliver 9M passengers through Dublin airport,
         sustaining 9,000 jobs in Dublin and generating a tourist spend of
         EUR2.5BN. To celebrate these 12 new European destinations, Ryanair is
         launching a seat sale today with every seat on every one of these routes
         (except Grenoble and Friedrichshafen) being sold for just EUR12 one way
         (including taxes, fees and charges) for travel during the first month of
         operation. This offer will run for one week only and I urge everybody to
         book their seats as quickly as possible on www.ryanair.com because at
         such low prices, these seats will sell out fast".
Ends.                        Wednesday, 9th August 2006

                      RYANAIR ANNOUNCE RECORD Q.1 RESULTS
         NET PROFIT RISES 80% TO EUR116m - TRAFFIC GROWS 25% TO 10.7m
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (August 1, 2006) announced
record profits of EUR115.7m for its first Quarter ended June 30, 2006. Traffic
grew by 25% to 10.7m passengers, yields increased 13%, ancillary revenues
climbed 31%, and consequently total revenues rose by 40% to EUR566.6m. Unit costs
excluding fuel fell by 2% (including fuel they rose by 6%) as fuel costs rose by
52% to EUR167.5m. The increase in profitability boosted cash balances which rose
by EUR212.4m to EUR2.18bn. As a result, Ryanair's adjusted after tax margin for the
Quarter rose by 4 points to 20% as Q.1 Adjusted Net Profit increased by a record
80% to EUR115.7m.

excludes a receipt, net of tax, of EUR5.2m arising from the settlement of an
insurance claim for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
"These bumper Q.1 profits - which were strongly signalled at the time of our
full year results in June - reflect a much stronger yield environment despite
substantially higher oil prices. We would caution however, based on advanced
bookings, that we do not expect this yield buoyancy to be maintained at similar
levels during the second quarter or indeed the second half of the fiscal year.
The underlying causes of these stronger Q.1 yields was primarily the presence of
Easter in the quarter (and its absence from the prior year comparable), many
more "sun" destinations, the impact of competitors fuel surcharges which
continue to drive traffic towards Ryanair, the initial impact of our baggage
charging initiative, and the earlier launch of our new bases and routes, much of
which took place in the fourth quarter last year.
We are pleased that ancillary revenues grew by 31% from an already significant
base, as the growth of ancillary sales continues to outpace that of scheduled
traffic. As we stimulate further traffic growth with lower fares, we find that
passengers are more willing to spend some of their savings on additional
products and services such as car hire, hotels and travel insurance.
Our new bases at Liverpool, East Midlands and Shannon continue to perform well,
with strong bookings over the Summer months, albeit that fares at Shannon
continue to be lower than expected. We plan to announce two new bases over the
coming months with launch dates in early 2007, as well as further expansion of
our existing bases.
During the quarter fuel costs rose by 52% to EUR167.5m. Excluding fuel unit costs
fell by 2% as we continue to aggressively manage costs in all other areas. Fuel
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
prices continue to be high and volatile. We have recently extended our hedging
position, so that we are 90% hedged to the end of October at $70 per barrel and
90% hedged for November and December at $74 per barrel. Thereafter we remain
unhedged for the January to March 2007 quarter, but we continue to monitor
forward rates and will try to avail of any suitable opportunity to hedge out our
outstanding requirement for the fiscal year.
During the quarter we exercised options for delivery of ten further Boeing
737-800 series aircraft in 2008. The addition of these new aircraft will enable
us to continue to drive down our aircraft and operating costs. The penetration
of web based check-in continues to improve with some flights achieving 50% of
web check-in. We will aggressively promote web check-in and priority boarding
for passengers travelling with hand luggage. We intend to continue to exploit
initiatives such as web check-in to reduce our costs, whilst at the same time
providing passengers with superior service such as avoiding check-in queues and
priority boarding.
We strongly welcome the take-over of the BAA airport monopoly by Ferrovial and
look forward to their review of plans and costings for the second runway at
Stansted. We anticipate that this review will confirm that a second runway and
terminal can be built at a more realistic cost of GBP1bn, rather than the GBP4bn
gold plated Taj Mahal proposed by the BAA airport monopoly. The Ferrovial
takeover highlighted that the BAA were able to fund a GBP1bn "pay-off" to its
shareholders just three months after it was telling the CAA Regulator that "it
couldn't afford" to pay for the second terminal at Stansted without doubling
passenger charges. This revelation should encourage the Regulator to take a much
more sceptical approach to the BAA's submissions and finalise a regulatory
review which meets the needs of users rather than featherbedding the BAA's
monopoly profits. We also welcome the OFT probe into the present monopoly
ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. Monopolies don't work and
don't serve the needs of consumers. Real competition between these three
airports will lead to lower airport charges and better facilities for
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
passengers, and Ryanair will continue to strongly campaign for the break-up of
the BAA airport monopoly, which has for many years delivered high passenger
charges and abysmal facilities at the London airports.
Our outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year remains cautious. As we
emphasised at the time of our full year results in June, we expected a bumper
set of Q.1 results, and a strong second quarter, but we believe that the
forthcoming Winter will be characterised by much more difficult trading
conditions. Ryanair will increase its fleet by 27 aircraft this Winter (compared
to last year's net increase of just 15) during which we will launch many more
new routes and bases. This combination of substantial Winter capacity expansion,
higher oil prices (now $74 per barrel compared to our original forecast of $70)
and price dumping by loss making competitors will mean another very difficult
Winter trading period and if oil prices are higher than $74, we may even sustain
losses during the fourth quarter this year. Based on our current fuel hedges and
the forward price of oil for the unhedged quarter, we anticipate that the
increase in net profit after tax for the fiscal year will still be within the
range of our previous guidance of +5% to +10% increase and that almost all of
these profits will be generated in Q.1 and Q.2, with a consequent reduction in
profitability during Q.3 and Q.4 compared to last year.
We remain on target to achieve our objective of becoming the world's largest
international scheduled airline by passenger traffic, whilst at the same time
growing profitability and reducing costs for the benefit of our passengers, our
people and our shareholders. We continue to believe that this growth in traffic
and profits will be achieved thanks to Ryanair's unique combination of lowest
costs, lowest fares and industry leading customer service".

              Management Discussion and Analysis of Results ("MD&A")
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted profit and loss account excluding the exceptional items and goodwill
referred to below.
Exceptional items in the quarter ended June 30, 2005 consist of a receipt of
EUR5.2m (net of tax) arising from the settlement of an insurance claim for the
scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Profit after tax increased by 66% to EUR115.7m compared to EUR69.6m in the quarter
ended June 30, 2005, whilst adjusted profit after tax increased by 80% to
EUR115.7m
Summary Quarter ended June 30, 2006
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -3-
Profit after tax increased by 80% to EUR115.7m, compared to EUR64.4m in the quarter
ended June 30, 2005. These results were achieved by strong growth in passenger
volumes and continued tight cost control, excluding fuel costs, which were
significantly higher than in the comparative quarter. Total operating revenues
increased by 40% to EUR566.6m, which was faster than the 25% growth in passenger
volumes, as average fares rose 13% and ancillary revenues grew 31% to EUR76.6m.
Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 12%, whilst Passenger Load
Factor increased by 1 point to 84% during the quarter.
Total operating expenses increased by 32% to EUR429.9m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs: primarily fuel, route charges, staff
costs, and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Fuel, which represents 39% of total operating costs compared to 34% in the
quarter to June 30, 2005, increased by 52% to EUR167.5m due to substantial
increases in the cost per gallon of fuel partly offset by a positive movement in
the US$ exchange rate and a 2% reduction in fuel consumption due to the
installation of winglets on a portion of our Boeing 737-800 fleet. It is
expected that the remaining retro-fit winglets will be installed across the
fleet by year end. Unit costs excluding fuel declined by 2% as all other cost
items, other than staff costs, increased at a slower rate than the growth in
passenger volumes. Staff costs rose by 35% reflecting an increase in our crewing
ratios primarily as a result of increases in our average sector length. Despite
the significantly higher fuel costs incurred, operating margins increased by 4
points to 24%, and operating profit increased by 71% to EUR136.7m.
Net Margins increased by 4 points to 20% for the reasons outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share have increased by 77% to 15.00 Euro cent for the
quarter.
Balance Sheet
The Company's profit growth continues to generate strong cashflow from
operations which for the quarter to June 30, 2006 amounted to EUR269.0m. This
cashflow part funded additional aircraft deposits and debt repayments, whilst
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -3-
the balance remaining is reflected in the EUR212.4m increase in Total Cash to
EUR2,184.4m since March 31, 2006. Capital expenditure net of sales proceeds
amounted to EUR21.3m during the quarter which largely consisted of aircraft
deposits. Long Term Debt, net of repayments, decreased by EUR36.3m with no new
debt drawndown in the quarter.

Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2006 have increased by EUR117.9m to EUR2,109.9m,
compared to March 31, 2006.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended June 30, 2006
Profit after tax, increased by 80% to EUR115.7m due to average fares increasing by
13% and strong ancillary revenue growth, which was partially offset by fuel
costs increasing by 52% to EUR167.5m reflecting the higher US$ cost per gallon.
Operating margins, as a result, increased by 4 points to 24%, which in turn
resulted in operating profit increasing by 71% to EUR136.7m compared to the
previous quarter ended June 30, 2005.
Total operating revenues increased by 40% to 566.6m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 25% to 10.7m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 12% in the
quarter due to a combination of higher average fares, and strong ancillary
revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 42% to EUR490.0m due to a combination of
increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new
routes and a 13% increase in average fares reflecting the positive impact of
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
Easter on fares. Easter is not included in the June 30, 2005 quarter comparative
as it occurred earlier.
Ancillary revenues increased 31% to EUR76.6m, a faster growth rate than passenger
volumes, reflecting a strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues
(primarily car hire, hotels and travel insurance), on-board sales and other
ancillary products.
Total operating expenses increased by 32% to EUR429.9m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs: primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route
charges, staff costs and airport and handling costs associated with the growth
of the airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by an
increase in the average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were
partially offset by the strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US$ and
lower fleet fuel burn resulting from the newly installed winglets.
Staff costs have increased by 35% to EUR56.7m primarily due to a 32% increase in
average employee numbers to 3,655 and the impact of pay increases granted.
Employee numbers rose due to an increase in our aircraft crewing ratios as a
result of continued increases in average sector length.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 12% to EUR35.6m due to an increase in
the size of the 'owned' fleet from 74 to 86, offset by a lower amortisation
charge due to the retirement of Boeing 737-200 aircraft and the positive impact
of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of aircraft amortisation. The
strengthening of the Euro to US$ also had a positive impact on the depreciation
and amortisation charge on new aircraft deliveries.
Fuel costs rose by 52% to EUR167.5m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, a 5% increase in sector length, and a significantly higher average US$
cost per gallon of fuel. The increased costs were partially offset by the
positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the quarter
and a 2% reduction in fuel consumption due to newly installed winglets on part
of our Boeing 737-800 fleet.
Maintenance costs increased by 17% to EUR10.7m reflecting improved reliability of
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
the Boeing 737-800's operated and a lower level of maintenance costs incurred
due to the retirement of the Boeing 737-200's, and the positive impact of the
strengthening of the Euro exchange rate, partially offset by an increase in the
number of leased Boeing 737-800 aircraft from 17 to 21.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 7% to EUR5.7m reflecting a lower
level of spend compared to the previous quarter.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 23% to EUR12.4m reflecting an additional 4
aircraft on lease during the quarter.
Route charges increased by 16% to EUR48.1m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown and an increase of 5% in the average sector length, offset by a
reduction in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 24% to EUR67.9m, which was slower than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 24% to EUR25.4m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products, and cost
reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have increased by 4 points to 24% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 71% to EUR136.7m during the
quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by 49% to EUR12.9m for the quarter due to the
combined impact of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in
average deposit rates earned in the quarter compared to the previous quarter.
Interest payable increased by 12% to EUR20.6m due to the increase in the level of
debt to part fund the purchase of new aircraft.
The Company's Balance Sheet reflects the increased profitability of the group.
The Company generated cash from operating activities of EUR269.0m that part funded
the capital expenditure programme and long term debt repayments, whilst the
balance is reflected in the EUR212.4m increase in Total Cash to EUR2,184.4m. Total
Debt, net of repayments declined by EUR36.3m to EUR1,641.4m during the quarter.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2006 have increased by EUR117.9m to EUR2,109.9m,
compared to March 31, 2006 reflecting the EUR115.7m increase in profitability
during the quarter, the exercise of share options which increased funds by
EUR1.0m, and the positive impact on reserves of EUR1.2m arising from the revaluation
of financial instruments, pensions and stock options.
                       Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
    This quarter's financial information has been prepared on the basis of the
     recognition and measurement requirements of International Financial
     Reporting Standards ("IFRS") in issue that were are adopted by the EU and
     effective (or available for early adoption) at March 31, 2006. These
     accounting policies are set out in the document titled "Explanation of the
     financial impact following adoption of IFRS" published in August, 2005.
2. Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
    The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     quarter ended June 30, 2006 on July 28, 2006.
3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
    The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the quarter ended June
     30, 2006 and the comparative quarter are based on the results reported under
     the group's IFRS accounting policies, as adjusted for certain exceptional
     items.
4. Accounting for Aircraft Spare Parts Maintenance
    Under IAS 16 spare parts held by an entity are classified as Property, Plant
     and Equipment if they are expected to be used for more than one period. In
     this quarter's financial information this has resulted in a reclassification
     of the maintenance expense incurred relating to the stock of spare aircraft
     parts owned from "Maintenance, materials and repairs" to "Depreciation and
     amortisation".
5. Accounting for Share-Based Payments
        Under SFAS No. 123R, which was adopted by the Company on April 1, 2006,
         the Company is required to account for share-based employee compensation
         using a fair value based method. The Company has elected to use the
         Binomial Lattice option pricing model to determine the fair-value of
         share-based awards under SFAS No. 123R, consistent with that previously
         used for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123 ("Accounting for
         Stock-Based Compensation").
        The Company has elected to use the modified prospective transition
         method as permitted by SFAS No. 123R and accordingly prior quarter's
         have not been restated to reflect the impact of the revised standard. In
         this quarter's financial information, the Company has, as a result of
         the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, recorded incremental share-based
         compensation expense of EUR1.043 million in its US GAAP income statement.
        Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company measured
         compensation expense for its employee share-based compensation plans
         using the intrinsic method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25. The Company
         applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, as if the fair value
         based method has been applied in measuring compensation expense. Under
         APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Group's employee
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
         share options was equal to the market price of the underlying share on
         the date of grant, no compensation expense was recognised. If the
         Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
         123 to share-based compensation during the three month quarter ended
         June 30, 2005, reported income under US GAAP would have been reduced by
         EUR0.291m from EUR71.041m to EUR70.750m with resulting Net income per ADS,
         basic and diluted, of 46.51 Euro cent and 46.33 Euro cent respectively.

                       RYANAIR WELCOMES EU INVESTIGATION
                INTO ITALIAN RESTRICTIONS ON FLIGHTS TO SARDINIA
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Thursday, 27th July 2006)
welcomed the EU Commission's announcement of an enquiry into the abuse of PSO
rules to block competition from low fare airlines and protect high fare Italian
airlines.
On May 2nd, the Italian authorities blocked Ryanair and Easyjet from offering
low fare flights between mainland Italy and Sardinia thereby ending competition
and choice. In the 3 months since Ryanair was forced off the routes average
fares have since increased fourfold from 40 to EUR160.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications, said:
        "Sardinian consumers and visitors are being ripped off, denied choice
         and paying fares 4 times higher than Ryanair's, solely as a result of
         the unlawful actions of the Italian authorities to block Ryanair's
         flights and permit the routes to be taken over by high fare Italian
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY Welcomes EU Investigation
         airlines.
        "We hope the EU investigation will be completed quickly and Ryanair's
         low fares restored to the Sardinian routes".

RYANAIR ANNOUNCES REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES TO SWEDEN DUE TO SWEDISH FLIGHT TAX
Ryanair, Europe's no.1 low-fares airline, today (Tuesday, 11th July 2006)
announced significant reductions in its services to and from Sweden. The airline
announced the cancellation of its twice daily service from Stockholm-Vasteras to
London-Luton, a reduction in its Malmo-Sturup to London-Stansted from twice
daily to a daily service and a reduction in its Gothenburg City Airport to
Glasgow-Prestwick service from five weekly flights to three weekly flights.
These reductions in service will be effective from the 28th of October 2006.
Passengers will be re-accommodated on another Ryanair service or, in the case of
Stockholm-Vasteras passengers will also be offered a full reimbursement of their
fare.
Ryanair has taken this decision due to the proposals by the Swedish Government
to introduce a new 94SEK tax, which will effectively add a further 30% to the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Announces Reductions Sweden
average cost of Ryanair's fares.
Announcing the decision at a press conference in Stockholm today, Ryanair's
Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said;
    "The Swedish Government is destroying low fare travel for Swedes and for
     those people who want to visit this beautiful country by attempting to push
     up the average cost of Ryanair's fares by over 30%. The introduction of this
     tax will make Swedish tourism uncompetitive when compared with cheaper
     alternatives in Spain, Italy and elsewhere in Europe. Tourism into Sweden
     has grown only due to the introduction of low fares by Ryanair. Last year,
     we carried over 2.4 million passengers to and from Sweden and Ryanair's
     incoming passengers contribute over 2bn SEK to the Swedish economy. The
     volume of this tourism is completely dependent on the existence of low cost
     air access. With the introduction of this tax the Swedish Government is now
     attempting to charge a premium for passengers to visit Sweden over and above
     the cost of visiting all their other destinations in Europe.
    "On the one hand the Finance Minister Per Nuder is claiming that the Swedish
     travel industry must grow and that he intends to invest significant sums of
     money to attract tourists. However, his Government is putting in place
     policies which are destroying tourism and removing all the economic benefits
     which it brings. In addition, he is undermining the ability of Swedish
     industry to compete internationally by making the cost of travel more
     expensive.
    "Finally, his Government is removing the benefit of low cost access which
     Ryanair and other low fare carriers have brought to the country.
    "This is a very sad day for the Swedish consumer and Swedish tourism. We
     hope this Government will see sense and reverse its decision to implement
     this iniquitous tax".

unprecedented volume of bookings following the announcement of our GBP1 seat sale.
We are used to our seat sales generating big increases in traffic but because
this sale includes flights for GBP1* during the popular first half of July,
traffic volumes broke all previous records. The record 198,000 bookings is a 16%

                      RYANAIR CALLS ON EUROPEAN COMMISSION
                           TO EXPEDITE INVESTIGATION
                   AFTER FURTHER ABUSE OF PSO RULES IN ITALY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Monday, 19th June 2006)
announced that it has written to the European Commission about the latest abuse
of the PSO rules in Italy. Ryanair contacted the Commission following the
announcement that Alitalia would be allowed to fly on a PSO route that it did
not even apply for in the first place!
When the Italian Civil Aviation Authority blocked Ryanair and Easyjet from
offering low fares, competition and choice to consumers between mainland Italy
and Sardinia in May, the European Commission launched an investigation into the
application of PSO rules in Italy. The PSO rules are being abused by the Italian
authorities to protect high fare Italian airlines and block low fares and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Expedite Investigation of PSO
competition.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "We are calling on the European Commission to reach a speedy conclusion
         to its investigation. Italian consumers are being forced to pay fares 4
         times higher than last year to fly between mainland Italy and Sardinia
         because the Italian authorities have systematically abused the PSO rules
         to protect high fare Italian airlines and block low fares and
         competition.
        "Following the announcement that Alitalia will be allowed to fly on a
         PSO route between mainland Italy and Sardinia that it did not even apply
         for, Ryanair is asking the Commission to investigate the following
         further abuses of the PSO rules:
 1)  Why has Alitalia been allowed to operate on a PSO route that it never
      applied for?
  2)  Why did Meridiana suddenly offer Alitalia a codeshare agreement on its PSO
      route after "mediation" by the Italian Ministry of Transport?
  3)  Why did AirOne and Meridiana agree to take on Alitalia's 100 Sardinian
      employees after the President of the Sardinian region declared that their
      jobs would be safe?
        "Italian consumers should not be denied choice and forced to pay higher
         fares because of the Italian Authorities' clumsy attempts to protect
         high fare Italian airlines. We are therefore calling on the Commission
         to take immediate action to end these abuses and allow competition and
         low fares on the Sardinian routes".

       Ryanair Responds to Latest Abusive Attempt by Air France to Block
                             Competition in France
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 13th June 2006)
announced that it has filed a further complaint to the European Commission on
Air France's latest attempt to block competition from low fares airlines in
France. Last month, Ryanair announced that it would base 2 new aircraft at
Marseille Airport, which will serve 13 routes and deliver almost 1 million
additional passengers annually to the airport, which equates to a EUR100 million
in savings to French consumers and visitors to France off the high fares of Air
France. However, Air France announced today that it had filed an action in the
French Conseille d'Etat against Marseille Airport in an attempt to block
Ryanair's use of this new low cost terminal - despite the fact that the tariff
for using this facility is published and has been agreed by the French Civil
Ryanair Holdings PLC Complaint to EU Comm on Air F
Aviation Authority.
Commenting today on this latest abuse by Air France, Ryanair's Head of
Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
        "This is the latest in a long line of abuses by Air France to protect
         their strangle-hold on the French market:
 1. Air France succeeded in blocking competition from Ryanair on the London to
     Strasbourg route. The result has been predictable, Air France is again
     ripping off consumers with EUR800 return fares and passenger numbers have
     plummeted from 20,000 per month to just over 2,000.
 2. Air France also blocked competition from easyJet in Bale-Mulhouse by again
     resorting to the local courts.
 3. Now Air France is trying to prevent Ryanair from using lower cost facilities
     in Marseille Provence Airport, which were offered to Air France but were
     rejected.
        "Ryanair has therefore today submitted a further complaint to the
         European Commission against Air France on the basis of an abuse of
         dominance under the European competition rules. In no other European
         member state does the national airline hold such a dominant position and
         engage in such abusive practices in order to block competition.
        "Last month, Ryanair filed a complaint to the European Commission
         regarding approximately EUR1 billion worth of state aid that Air France
         has received from the French Government in the form of subsidised
         domestic landing and passenger fees. This illegal state aid has enabled
         Air France to dominate the French market and force smaller competitors
         off the market.
        "If Jean-Cyrille Spinetta is truly concerned about "equality", then he
         should:
 1. have accepted Marseille Airport's offer of lower cost, efficient facilities
     instead of abusing the French Court system to prevent competition.
 2. stop ripping off French consumers and start charging the same fares as
     Ryanair.
 3. start paying the same landing fees on domestic traffic as Ryanair has to pay
     on international flights instead of receiving illegal subsidies from the
     French Government.
        "We are calling on the European Commission to put an end to Air France's
         abusive practices in the French market and to promote competition from
         low fares airlines, which have been successful in bringing low fares,
         competition and choice to every other European Member State, except
         France!"
  Ends.                                               Tuesday, 13th June 2006

                              RYANAIR BACKS ROONEY
              50,000 FREE* FLIGHTS IF WAYNE PLAYS IN THE WORLD CUP
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 7th June 2006), in
advance of Wayne Rooney's decisive scan, announced that it will give England
fans 50,000 free* flights if wonder-kid Wayne plays in the World Cup.
Announcing the give-away, Ryanair's Head of Communications Peter Sherrard said:
        "Ryanair has long since been a huge fan of Wayne's, and not just because
         we're introducing in-flight gambling in 2007. So if Wayne completes his
         remarkable recovery and plays in the world's biggest sporting event, we
         will give England fans 50,000 free* flights for travel on routes from
         the UK.
        "Ryanair is already the fans' firm favourite for World Cup travel, and
         we are confident that Wayne will make it to Germany. If he does, we will
         be giving 50,000 England supporters even more reason to celebrate".
* Excludes taxes and charges, specific routes ex-UK for travel in September,
October and November.

                RYANAIR FULL YEAR RESULTS AHEAD OF EXPECTATIONS
               RECORD NET PROFIT OF EUR302M AS TRAFFIC GROWS TO 35M
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 6 June 2006) announced
record after tax profits of EUR302m, some EUR7m ahead of previous expectations.
Traffic grew by 26% to 35m passengers, yields were up 1%, as total revenues grew
by 28% to EUR1.69 billion. Excluding fuel, unit costs fell by 6% (including fuel
they rose by 5%). Fuel costs rose by 74% to EUR462m. Despite these substantially
higher fuel costs, Ryanair achieved an 18% after tax margin, as adjusted net
profits increased for the year by 12% to EUR302m.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
Note 1: Adjusted profit and EPS to March 31, 2005 excludes an amount of EUR11.9m
(net of tax) resulting from changes in the accounting treatment for Goodwill
arising on the Buzz acquisition following the adoption of IFRS (International
Financial Reporting Standards) Note 2: Adjusted profit after tax and EPS for the
year ended March 31, 2006 excludes an amount of EUR5.2m ( net of tax) arising from
the settlement of an aircraft insurance claim.
Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
"Ryanair has again delivered record traffic and profits despite substantially
higher oil prices, intense competition and the absence of Easter from the fourth
quarter. This robust performance validates our lowest fare/lowest cost model
which continues to grow profitably in Europe even during adverse market
conditions, when many of our competitors are reporting losses.
Highlights of the past 12 months include:
   After tax profit of EUR302m, an increase of 12% despite a 74% increase in
     fuel costs.
    Cost discipline continues with a 6% unit cost reduction excluding fuel.
    Average yields increased by 1% despite a 27% increase in capacity.
    Significant traffic growth of 26% to 35m passengers, across 330 routes
     with 103 aircraft.
    The retirement of our remaining B737-200's, reduced the average age of
     Ryanair's fleet to 21/2 years, the youngest in Europe.
    46 new routes and 1 new base have already been announced for the remainder
     of 2006.
    Our balance sheet has been further strengthened with cash increasing EUR366m
     to EUR1.97 billion.
"The key to Ryanair's traffic and profit growth was our refusal to levy fuel
surcharges on our passengers at a time when most other airlines in Europe are
introducing or increasing them. In some cases other airline surcharges exceed
our average fares. This is driving millions of passengers to Ryanair. We will
continue to absorb significantly higher oil prices thanks to the benign yield
environment and continuing unit cost reductions.
"We have taken advantage of the recent short-term fall in oil prices to hedge
90% of our needs from June to October 2006 at an average price of $70 a barrel.
The recent weakness in the dollar will help us to partially offset these higher
oil prices. We remain unhedged from October onwards, and will continue to look
for opportunities to hedge further into the future, but only if suitable pricing
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
opportunities present themselves. As always hedging will eliminate near-term
uncertainty and risk, it will not deliver lower costs during periods of rising
oil prices.
"Ryanair's inexorable growth in aircraft, routes and passengers continues. Over
the coming year we expect traffic to grow by 20% to 42m passengers. Traffic at
our new bases in Liverpool, Nottingham East Midlands and Shannon is performing
well, with strong advance bookings into the Summer months. The passenger
response to our new French base at Marseille which will open in November has
been very positive. We also expect to announce one or possibly two further bases
for Spring 2007 and expansion of some of our existing bases before the end of
the Summer.
"We refuse to allow higher oil prices distract us from aggressively pursuing
unit cost reductions and operating efficiencies. A number of recent initiatives
will help our drive for lower costs and fares. Web based check-in and charging
for bags are both running ahead of expectations. After some initial delays with
the roll out of web check-in we are now seeing flights with over 50% of
passengers using our web check-in and priority boarding facility. Charging for
check-in bags has encouraged passengers to travel with fewer and in some cases
zero check-in bags. Indications over the past two months suggest that this
initiative may offset the anticipated decline in overall yields by more than EUR1
per passenger.
"The winglet modification programme on our 737 fleet is proving effective with
better aircraft performance and a 2% reduction in fleet fuel consumption, a
saving which we believe can be improved over the coming year. Our operating
performance continues to make Ryanair the No. 1 customer service airline in
Europe. No other major or low cost airline can match Ryanair's record for
consistently high punctuality, with fewest lost bags and least flight
cancellations.
"Ancillary revenues continue to grow strongly. From an already high base we
expect these revenues will grow at a faster rate than scheduled traffic for the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
coming year. We are close to finalising new initiatives to offer our customers
mobile phone services on board in 2007 and website gambling which we believe
will give a further boost to ancillary revenues in this fiscal year.
"Negotiations on pilot pay were successfully concluded at 14 of our 15 bases
(excluding Dublin) at the end of April. Pilots at 13 bases have voted for a one
year deal with a basic pay increase of 1.8%, whilst the Luton base voted for a 4
year deal which incorporated a 5% pay increase this year, as well as improved
rosters. The Dublin pilots continued to absent themselves from these direct
negotiations with the company, as is their right and consequently they have not
yet negotiated any pay increase this year.
"We are also continuing to campaign for the breakup of the BAA airport monopoly
in the UK. We welcome the OFT's recent announcement that it is considering
looking into the BAA's monopoly over the main London Airports. It should examine
why the BAA is pushing ahead with plans to spend some GBP4 billion on a second
runway at Stansted that should only cost around GBP1 billion. The contradiction
between the BAA's position 3 months ago - that it couldn't afford to build this
runway in Stansted without doubling passenger charges - with its recent
announcement that it will return over GBP1 billion to its shareholders this year,
is typical of the overcharging monopoly. This clearly demonstrates how the BAA
has been featherbedding its balance sheet, at the expense of airline users and
the travelling public. It also proves that the CAA has failed to regulate this
overcharging monopoly in the interests of users. Competition between the London
airports will improve facilities and reduce costs. Regulation has clearly
failed.
"Ryanair's fleet will increase by 30 aircraft between September 2006 and April
2007. We will launch a large number of new routes and bases at the worst time of
the year, and we expect that Winter trading will be negatively effected by a
combination of this capacity expansion, much higher oil prices (compared to last
year) and further price dumping by loss making competitors who will be trying to
survive next Winter.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
"Accordingly we remain cautious about our profit guidance for the coming year.
Whilst we are confident that traffic will grow by 20% to 42m passengers and
yields will be flat, we expect that profit growth will be more modest in the +5%
to +10% range if oil prices remain at $70 a barrel. Profitability will also be
more seasonally pronounced due to the presence of Easter in Q.1, the impact of
competitor fuel surcharges, and the higher proportion of "sun" routes operated
this Summer. We expect that in excess of 85% of annual profits (compared to 80%
last year) will be earned in the first half of this fiscal year, and thereafter
profitability in Q.3 and Q.4 will be reduced (against last years comparables) as
the proportion of annual profits earned in the last two quarters falls to less
than 15% of the annual total.
"It is Ryanair's resolute commitment to offering the lowest fares in every
market which has made us Europe's largest low fares airline. Shortly we will
become the "World's Favourite" airline, as we expect to overtake Lufthansa's
international passenger traffic later this year, thereby making Ryanair the
world's largest international scheduled airline by passenger numbers. Ryanair
will continue to deliver the lowest costs and the lowest air fares in Europe for
the benefit of our customers, our people and our shareholders".

Group. Total Debt, net of repayments increased by EUR262.9m during the year.
Shareholders' Funds at March 31, 2006 have increased by EUR257.5m to EUR1,992.0m,
compared to March 31, 2005 reflecting the EUR306.7m increase in profitability
during the year, and the exercise of share options which increased funds by
EUR30.6m, offset by a reduction of EUR82.1m resulting from changes in the accounting
treatment for derivative financial instruments, pensions and stock options
following the adoption of IFRS.
                       Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
    This period's financial information has been prepared on the basis of the
     recognition and measurement requirements of International Financial
     Reporting Standards ("IFRS") in issue that were are adopted by the EU and
     effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006. These
     accounting policies are set out in the document titled "Explanation of the
     financial impact following adoption of IFRS" published in August 2005 with
     the first quarter financial results.
2. Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
    The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     year ended March 31, 2006 on 1st June, 2006.
3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -5-
    The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the year ended March
     31,2006 and the comparative period are based on the results reported under
     the group's preliminary IFRS accounting policies, as adjusted for certain
     exceptional items.
4. Ancillary Products and Services
    In order to more accurately reflect the structure of certain ancillary
     contracts and to provide more meaningful information to users the Group has
     taken the opportunity to reclassify certain ancillary revenues and costs
     (primarily car hire and travel insurance). This has resulted in a reduction
     in revenues of EUR25.8 million with a corresponding reduction in costs in the
     period ended March 31, 2006 (March 31, 2005: EUR17.5 million). This has
     resulted in an increase in net margin of 0.3% to 17.8% in the period ended
     March 31, 2006 (March 31, 2005 0.3% to 20.3%). Going forward the Group
     intends to report ancillary revenues and costs on a basis consistent with
     the treatment described herein.
5. Purchase Accounting Adjustment
    Subsequent to the acquisition of Buzz Stansted in April 2003 Ryanair
     renegotiated the terms and conditions of onerous aircraft leases and
     agreed to return the aircraft to the lessors in late 2004, thereby
     releasing Ryanair from any remaining lease obligations at that time.
     Irish GAAP permitted that such an adjustment could be made to the
     provisional value of the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the
     original business combination; provided that the adjustment was made
     either in the reporting period that the combination took place or the
     first full financial period following the transaction. IFRS 3, however,
     only allows such an adjustment to be made in the 12 month period
     following the acquisition, and accordingly, as the event occurred more
     than 12 months after the acquisition date, under IFRS this adjustment is
     made to the Group's income statement instead. This gives rise to a
     credit of EUR11.9m to the income statement in the year to March 31, 2005.

                              Ryanair Holdings plc
                 Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted profit and loss account excluding the exceptional items and goodwill
referred to below.
Exceptional items in the year ended March 31, 2006 consist of a receipt of EUR5.2m
(net of tax) in quarter 1 arising from the settlement of an insurance claim for
the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Following the adoption of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) the
Company was obliged to change its accounting treatment for Business
acquisitions. This has resulted in a one-off, non-cash release of EUR11.9m in the
year ended March 31, 2005. (see note 5 attached).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
Profit after tax increased by 10% to EUR306.7m compared to EUR280.1m in the previous
year ended March 31, 2005, whilst adjusted profit after tax increased by 12% to
EUR301.5m
The results for the year and comparative year have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standard ("IFRS") accounting policies
expected to be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31
March 2006, and a detailed explanation of the financial impact of the adoption
of these policies was set out in a separate document issued with the quarterly
financial results for the period to 30 June 2005.
Summary Year ended March 31, 2006
Profit after tax increased by 12% to EUR301.5m, compared to EUR268.1m in the
previous year ended March 31, 2005. These results were achieved by strong growth
in passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, excluding fuel costs,
which were significantly higher than in the comparative period. Total operating
revenues increased by 28% to EUR1,692.5m, which was faster than the 26% growth in
passenger volumes, as average fares rose by 1% and ancillary revenues grew by
36% to EUR259.2m. Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 2%, whilst
Passenger Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 83% during the year.
Total operating expenses increased by 34% to EUR1,323.4, due to the increased
level of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges, staff
costs, and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Fuel, which represents 35% of total operating costs compared to 27% last year,
increased by 74% to EUR462.5m due to substantial increases in the cost per gallon
of fuel partly offset by a positive movement in the US$ exchange rate. Unit
costs excluding fuel declined by 6% as all other major cost items increased,
other than maintenance and aircraft rentals, at a slower rate than the growth in
passenger volumes. This is despite the impact on last year's comparative figures
of the release of maintenance provisions of EUR5.2m arising from the return of 6
leased Boeing 737-300's to the lessor. Due to the significantly higher fuel
costs incurred, operating margins declined by 3 points to 22%, whilst operating
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
profit increased by 12% to EUR369.1m.
Net Margins declined by 2 points to 18% for the reasons outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share have increased by 11% to 39.32 cent for the year.
Balance Sheet
The Company's profit growth continues to generate strong cashflow from
operations which for the year to March 31, 2006 amounted to EUR599.0m. This
cashflow part funded the extensive aircraft delivery programme, and additional
aircraft deposits, whilst the balance remaining is reflected in the EUR366.3m
increase in Total Cash since March 31, 2005. Capital expenditure net of sales
proceeds amounted to EUR526.2m during the year made up predominantly of the cost
of delivery of 21 737-800 aircraft. Long Term Debt, drawndown to part fund
aircraft deliveries, increased by EUR262.9m, net of repayments.
Shareholders' Funds at March 31, 2006 have increased by EUR257.5m to EUR1,992.0m,
compared to March 31, 2005.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Year ended March 31, 2006
Profit after tax, increased by 12% to EUR301.5m due to average fares increasing by
1% and strong ancillary revenue growth, which was offset by much higher fuel
costs that increased by 74% to EUR462.5m reflecting the higher US$ cost per
gallon. Operating margins, as a result, fell by 3 points to 22%, which in turn
resulted in operating profit increasing by 12% to EUR369.1m compared to the
previous year ended March 31 2005.
Total operating revenues increased by 28% to EUR1,692.5m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 26% to 34.8m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 2% in the
year due to a combination of slightly higher average fares and strong ancillary
revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 27% to EUR1,433.4m due to a combination
of increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Liverpool, Shannon, East Midlands, Pisa, Cork and a 1% increase in
average fares.
Ancillary revenues increased 36% to EUR259.2m, a faster growth rate than passenger
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
volumes, reflecting a strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues
(primarily car hire, hotels and travel insurance), on-board sales and other
ancillary products. Ancillary revenues continue to grow at a significantly
faster rate than passenger volumes.
Total operating expenses increased by 34% to EUR1,323.4m due to the increased
level of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals,
route charges, staff costs and airport and handling costs associated with the
growth of the airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by an
increase in the average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were
partially offset by the strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US$.
Staff costs have increased by 21% to EUR171.4m primarily due to an 18% increase in
average employee numbers to 3,063 and the impact of pay increases granted of 3%.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 14% to EUR112.9m. A higher depreciation
charge due to an increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from 74 to 86, was
offset by a lower amortisation charge due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft
and the positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of aircraft
amortisation. The strengthening of the Euro to US$ also had a positive impact on
the depreciation and amortisation charge on new aircraft deliveries.
Fuel costs rose by 74% to EUR462.5m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, an 8% increase in sector length, and a significantly higher average US$
cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the positive impact of the
strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the year.
Maintenance costs increased by 29% to EUR49.0m reflecting improved reliability of
the 737-800s operated and a lower level of maintenance costs incurred due to the
return of six 737-300's, the retirement of the 737-200's, and the positive
impact of the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate, partially offset by an
increase in the number of leased 737-800 aircraft from 13 to 17.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 29% to EUR13.9m due to the reduction
in the level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to the
previous year.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
Aircraft rental costs increased by 42% to EUR47.4m reflecting an additional 4
aircraft on lease during the year, EUR5.5m incurred on short term leases during
the 4th quarter offset by the savings arising from the return of 6 737-300's to
ILFC.
Route charges increased by 21% to EUR164.6m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown and an increase of 8% in the average sector length, offset by a
reduction in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 21% to EUR216.3m, which was slower than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 8% to EUR85.6m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products, and cost
reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 3 points to 22% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 12% to EUR369.1m during the year.
Interest receivable has increased by 35% to EUR38.2m for the period due to the
combined impact of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in
average deposit rates earned in the period compared to last year.
Interest payable increased by 28% to EUR74.0m due to the drawdown of further debt
to part fund the purchase of new aircraft.
Foreign exchange losses have decreased during the year to EUR1.1m due to the
positive impact of changes in the Sterling and US Dollar exchange rates against
the Euro compared to last year.
The gain on disposal of fixed assets of EUR0.8m arises from the disposal of the
remaining nine 737-200 aircraft during the year.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to reflect the significant capital
expenditure programme being undertaken by the group. An additional 21 aircraft
were delivered during the year which in conjunction with the payment of deposits
on future deliveries accounted for the bulk of EUR534.7m spent on capital
expenditure during the year. During the same period the Company generated cash
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
from operating activities of EUR599.0m that part funded the capital expenditure
programme which the balance reflected in Total Cash of EUR1,972.0m. The exercise
of share options, primarily by pilots generated a further EUR30.6m cash for the

                     RYANAIR ANNOUNCES LONG TERM AGREEMENT
                         WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF MOROCCO
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, today (Thursday, 25th May 2006)
announced the completion of a five year agreement with the Government of Morocco
to develop low cost air access and tourism to the country from Ryanair's bases
throughout Europe. The announcement marks the culmination of discussions between
the airline and the Government which have taken place over the last six months
and reflects the Moroccan Government's policy of encouraging significant growth
in its tourism industry as well as providing low cost access for its citizens
for business and leisure purposes. The agreement covers most of the regional
airports in Morocco and involves the commitment by Ryanair to develop up to 20
routes delivering almost 1 million passengers per annum by the end of the five
year period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Agreement with Morocco
Announcing the agreement in Rabat today, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive,
Michael Cawley said:
        "We are delighted to make this joint announcement with the Government of
         Morocco. This represents a singularly important initiative in the
         development of tourism and business for the country. The Government has
         recognised that low cost air access is a growth vehicle for tourism
         throughout Europe and by joining the Open Skies regime and embracing
         Europe's leading low fares airline, the Government in Morocco has made a
         clear statement about its intentions to develop its tourism industry in
         the next five years.
        "Ryanair's commitment to establish up to 20 routes and carry close to 1
         million passengers per annum on flights to Morocco is a vote of
         confidence by the airline in the excellence and attractiveness of
         Morocco as a destination both for weekend breaks, mid-week trips and
         longer holidays. Our low fares will also help ex-patriate Moroccans to
         see their families more often and facilitate local businesses in
         accessing markets with low fare routes including those already announced
         to both Frankfurt and Marseille.
        "Ryanair will be making many more new route announcements in Morocco
         over the coming months and years as we build on the solid basis which
         this long term agreement provides. I congratulate the Government of
         Morocco on this initiative and look forward to working successfully with
         it to develop its tourism and other business".

                         RYANAIR WELCOMES OFT PROPOSAL
                        TO LOOK AT BAA MONOPOLY AIRPORTS
Ryanair, Britain's favourite airline this morning (Thursday, 25th May 2006)
welcomed the OFT statement that it may look into the UK airports market with a
view to establishing whether the current structure works well for consumers.
Ryanair, as the airline which carries most consumers to/from the UK would
strongly support an OFT investigation into the BAA airport monopoly. Ryanair and
other airlines have long called for the break up of this inefficient
gold-plating, over-charging monopoly. The fact that the BAA's recent defence
document offered to pay GBP750m to its shareholders if the Ferrovial bid is
rejected demonstrates what a cash cow this monopoly has become.
Speaking today on the OFT's statement, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael
O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcomes OFT Proposal
    "We would strongly welcome an investigation by the OFT of the BAA airport
     monopoly. When a Government protected monopoly like the BAA can spend GBP4bn
     building facilities at Stansted which should only cost GBP1bn, something is
     wrong. When as part of this process the BAA at Stansted can spend GBP25m on
     consultants' reports without producing even one page of a report, something
     is very wrong. When the BAA monopoly offers a sweetener of GBP750m to its
     shareholders to reject Ferrovial's bid, it clearly proves that this monopoly
     has been overcharging passengers and feathering its own nest.
    "The only way to improve the lot of passengers is to break up the BAA
     monopoly airports and force them to compete against each other. Then airline
     customers would not be forced to endure the black hole of Calcutta that is
     Heathrow, or the unnecessary over priced Taj Mahal palace being planned at
     Stansted.
    "Competition works in favour of consumers, monopolies just rip them off, and
     the BAA airport monopoly is living proof of this".

                   RYANAIR TO APPEAL ITALIAN COURT'S DECSION
                       TO BLOCK LOW FARES AND COMPETITON
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Friday, 12th May 2006) stated
that it will appeal the decision of the regional administrative court of Lazio
to stop Ryanair and Easyjet's low fare flights on routes between mainland Italy
and Sardinia.
The Italian authorities blocked Ryanair's low fare flights between Rome and
Alghero by imposing a Public Service Obligation on the route in spite of the
fact that 2 airlines (Ryanair and Airone) were already operating year round
flights between Rome and Alghero. This is not allowed under European PSO rules.
These rules have also been abused by the Italian authorities because Alitalia is
being allowed to fly on PSO routes to Sardinia when it did not even apply to
operate them in the first place.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair appeals Italian Court
Speaking today Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "We have instructed our lawyers to appeal this decision to the European
         courts to ensure that low fares and competition are allowed in Italy. It
         is astonishing that while Ryanair has been blocked from offering low
         fares between mainland Italy and Sardinia, Alitalia is being allowed to
         sell its high fares on PSO routes that it did not even apply for.
        "The PSO system in Europe is clearly out of control. It is being abused
         by national Governments to protect high fare flag carriers while at the
         same time blocking low fare competition. Italian consumers and visitors
         should not be forced to pay higher fares because the Italian authorities
         are abusing the PSO system to protect Alitalia and other high fare
         Italian airlines".

               Ryanair Launches EUR1 Billion in State Aid Complaint
                               Against Air France
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 11th May 2006)
announced that it had launched a complaint to the European Commission against
Air France regarding approximately EUR1 billion in illegal state aid that Air
France has received from the French Government over the past number of years.
The French Government has maintained an airport charging system whereby landing
and passenger charges for domestic routes are often up to 50% lower than on
routes between France and other EU Member States. This is illegal under European
law and the European Commission has sued other Governments for similar
differentiated charging.
As a result of this unfair price advantage Air France has received almost a EUR1
billion in illegal state aid, which has furthered their dominance in the French
Ryanair Holdings PLC Complaint against Air France
market and has placed competitors like Ryanair at a serious competitive
disadvantage. Ryanair have therefore called on the European Commission to
require the French Government to regularise their charging system and to force
Air France to repay this illegal state aid.
Announcing the complaint against Air France, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory
Affairs, Jim Callaghan, said:
        "Air France has a rampant monopoly in the French market and this
         dominance has been enhanced by the illegal airport charging system that
         has been maintained in France, despite rulings by the European
         Commission in other EU member states. These substantially lower charges
         on domestic French routes, on which Air France has an almost complete
         monopoly, have allowed them to make super profits on domestic routes and
         to cross subsidise their international routes, on which they compete
         with airlines like Ryanair. As a result, France is the only major EU
         country that does not have a significant low fares airline presence.
        "For far too long, the French Government have been protecting Air France
         from competition and this is the most blatant example. Ryanair are now
         asking the European Commission to take urgent action against the French
         Government and to force Air France to repay this illegal state aid in
         order to remove the distortion of competition in the French market".

                          13 ROUTES FROM NOVEMBER '06
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 airline today (Wednesday, 10th May 2006) announced that

Marrakech, Oujda, Oslo, Porto and Rome.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO today in Marseille said:
        "Ryanair's first base in France marks a major breakthrough for French
         passengers/visitors who will no longer suffer Air France's high fares.
         This base will revolutionise travel to/from the Provence region. It
         would not have been possible without Marseille Provence airport who have
         developed a low cost terminal that has won them this base despite
         intense competition from 5 other low cost European airports.
        "Now Marseille airport which has suffered a passenger decline from 6.5M
         in 2000 to 5.8M in 2006 will achieve record growth in 06/07 thanks to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Marseille is 16th Euro Base
         this new low cost partnership with Ryanair.
        "Ryanair's low fare routes are good news for business and tourism in
         Provence. Marseille airport will become the low fare airport for the
         South of France as Ryanair delivers almost 1M passengers p.a. This
         traffic will sustain 1,000 jobs whilst allowing passengers in the region

                  RECORD MONTHLY PASSENGER TRAFFIC FOR RYANAIR
                      APRIL TRAFFIC RISES TO 3.44 MILLION
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 4th May 2006)
celebrated its highest ever monthly passenger traffic with a record 3.44 M
passengers in April, a 29% increase on 2005.
Announcing the record passenger traffic, Peter Sherrard Ryanair's Head of
Communications, said:
        "In the single month of April 2006, Ryanair carried more passengers than
         it did during the whole 12 months of 1997. Ryanair now operates 332
         routes to and from 117 airports across 22 countries and there is no
         better proof of Ryanair's popularity than passenger growth throughout
         Europe.
        "Ryanair is growing while British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France all
         stagnate in Europe because passengers want Ryanair's low fare, on time
         and efficient services and they know they will not find these with the
         high fare usually late, fuel surchargers".

                           AER LINGUS FUEL SURCHARGE
                        IS A EUR42M. RIP OFF SAYS RYANAIR
Ryanair - the only European airline to guarantee no fuel surcharges today,
tomorrow or ever - today called on Aer Lingus to reverse its planned surcharge
of EUR35 on long-haul flights from 15th May next.
Aer Lingus today claims that it cannot absorb these fuel price increases. This
claim is patently dishonest when Aer Lingus are absorbing these fuel price
increases on its short-haul business, which accounts for over 80% of Aer
Lingus's traffic. The travelling public must wonder why Aer Lingus is willing to
absorb these higher fuel costs in the case of 80% of its passengers who fly
short-haul, but decides to introduce an unjustified EUR35 fuel surcharge to fleece
the 1.2m passengers flying long-haul for an extra EUR42m a year.
The reason why Aer Lingus can't introduce fuel surcharges on its UK and European
Ryanair Holdings PLC ALingus Fuel Surcharge RipOff
routes is because Ryanair guarantees no fuel surcharges. Aer Lingus has far less
competition on long-haul routes, so it has decided instead to further gouge
those same passengers who are already paying Aer Lingus's highest air fares.
This is clearly unjustified, when at the very same time Aer Lingus is absorbing
higher oil prices in the case of short-haul tickets.
Highlighting this latest Aer Lingus rip-off, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael
O'Leary said:
        "These fuel surcharges are just the latest EUR42m rip off from Aer Lingus.
         They claim that they can't absorb these higher oil prices, yet they are
         absorbing them in the case of the 5.8 million of their passengers who
         are flying short-haul. Aer Lingus's long-haul passengers are already
         paying their highest air fares, so there is no justification for adding
         EUR42m in extra fuel surcharges on these long-haul passengers either.
        "Today's latest rip-off from Aer Lingus confirms yet again that they
         only way Irish consumers can be sure of not paying fuel surcharges is to
         book Ryanair today, tomorrow and forever, because only Ryanair
         guarantees that there will be no fuel surcharges today, tomorrow or
         ever".

            ENAC STIFLES COMPETITION BY BANNING RYANAIR'S LOW FARES
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Thursday, 20th April 2006)
spoke out against ENAC for banning the airline's low fares flights on the Rome
(Ciampino) - Alghero route after May 01st. Ryanair has complained to the
European Commission against the abuse of the PSO rules in Italy whereby the
operation of some commercially viable routes is being granted exclusively to
selected Italian carriers in order to funnel more state aid to these airlines.
Ryanair has also applied to the Administrative Court in Rome to ensure that over
10,000 Italian consumers who are already booked to fly on this route after May
1st are not denied travel because of ENAC's anti-competitive favouritism towards
Italian carriers.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs & Company Secretary,
Jim Callaghan, said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC ENAC BANS RYANAIR
        "The Italian Government's attempt to impose a Public Service Obligation
         on this route is ludicrous. Ryanair has already carried 100,000
         passengers on the Rome-Alghero route in its first year of operation with
         fares of less than 40 euro and with no subsidies, which also means that
         the Italian taxpayer is not being gouged either. Air One is also
         offering services from Rome Fiumicino to Alghero. The imposition of a
         PSO is therefore clearly illegal under European law. We are confident
         that the European Commission and the Italian courts will put an end to
         this anti-competitive and illegal behaviour.
        "It is about time ENAC stopped trying to protect Alitalia and other
         Italian carriers and put a stop to illegal state aid. Such aid promotes
         high fares for Italian consumers and inefficient services. We are
         calling on our passengers to log on to www.ryanair.com and send a
         protest letter to Ryanair which we will forward to the Ministry of
         Transport. We are urging passengers to speak out now to ensure that
         Ryanair continues to operate its low fare, No.1 customer service route.
        "We are assuring passengers that we will continue to fight for low
         fares, competition and choice for Italian consumers on the Rome to
         Alghero route".

RYANAIR GUARANTEES NO FUEL SURCHARGES AS BRITISH AIRWAYS GOUGES PASSENGERS FOR A
                                     7TH TIME
Ryanair, the world's favourite airline, today (Tuesday, 18th April 2006)
criticised British Airways for again increasing fuel surcharges - for a record
7th time - despite the fact that it has substantially hedged most of its fuel
for the remainder of 2006 at less than $60 a barrel. Ryanair continues to be the
only major airline in Britain which guarantees no fuel surcharges, today,
tomorrow or ever. Oil prices can double again to $150 per barrel and Ryanair
still won't apply fuel surcharges.
Criticising British Airways for its constant gouging of consumers, Ryanair's
Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
    "Yet again British Airways go for the soft option. This is the 7th separate
     fuel surcharge British Airways have introduced since May 2004. Over the past
     two years as oil prices have doubled from $35 to $70 a barrel, British
     Airways' fuel surcharges have increased fourteen fold from GBP2.50 per sector
     to GBP35 per sector. This is price gouging of consumers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR - NO FUEL SURCHARGES
    "At GBP35 per sector, British Airways' fuel surcharge is greater than
     Ryanair's average fare (GBP28 per sector). Isn't it time that BA stopped
     gouging passengers and started reducing other costs instead?
    "Ryanair would be pleased to hear from the so called Air Transport Users
     Committee in the UK who have remained steadfastly silent, whilst British
     Airways have added 7 separate fuel surcharges to hard pressed consumers.
     Since this quango claims to represent air transport users, why does it
     continue to remain silent while British Airways levy 7 separate fuel
     surcharges?"
For the record Ryanair guarantees no fuel surcharges, today, tomorrow or ever.
Ryanair's average fare (GBP28) is now less than British Airways one way fuel
surcharge (GBP35). The message for British consumers and visitors couldn't be
clearer. If you want to get there on-time, on brand new aircraft and be certain
of no fuel surcharges fly Ryanair. If you want to pay 7 separate fuel
surcharges, on old aircraft and don't mind being late, fly BA.

        RYANAIR CALLS ON POLISH GOVERNMENT TO INTRODUCE AIRPORT REFORMS
                 100,000 SEATS FOR 1 ZLOTY* ON 18 POLISH ROUTES
              100 FREE FLIGHTS** FOR SUPPORTERS OF AIRPORT REFORM
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th April 2006)
called on the Polish Government to reform the management of its airports by
abolishing rigid centralised tariffs, which place regional airports at a
disadvantage and hinders their ability to grow. Ryanair also called on the
Government to open a secondary airport for Warsaw in Modlin, which would
significantly increase competition, and lower airfares for all passengers and
visitors to Warsaw.
If such reforms are made, Polish consumers would enjoy massive improvements in
low fare access to and from the regions allowing tourism and business to prosper
through increased visitor numbers. Ryanair alone would deliver an increase in
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR URGE POLISH GOVERNMEN
traffic from 1.6M to 10M passengers p.a. supporting 10,000 Polish jobs within 5
years.
Speaking today in Warsaw, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
        "Poland has already benefited enormously from the growth that Ryanair
         low fares have brought, but if this is to continue, the Polish
         Government must introduce significant reform of its outdated airport
         system.
        "Regional airports in Poland must be allowed to fulfil their potential
         as wealth and job creators in their regions but they cannot do this when
         their costs are controlled centrally in Warsaw, restricting their
         capacity to compete for new business.
        "We are also calling on the Polish Government to open a secondary
         airport for Warsaw at the ex military base in Modlin. All over Europe
         secondary competing airports around major cities have been hugely
         beneficial in driving down airfares and increasing visitor numbers to
         capital cities.
        "Ryanair is committed to reducing the cost of travel for Polish
         consumers and visitors. We can only do this, if regional Polish airports
         are freed to compete on a level playing field for growth. To show we are
         serious about delivering growth in Poland if reforms are implemented,
         Ryanair is today offering 100,000 seats on 18 of its Polish routes for 1
         zloty* on www.ryanair.com. In addition, the first 100 people who email
         messages of support for reform in Polish airports to
         polishsupport@ryanair.com will receive a free flight**".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
04 April 2006
                        CAA FIDDLES WHILE STANSTED BURNS
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Tuesday, 4th April 2006)
renewed its call for the CAA Regulator to take action against the overcharging
BAA airport monopoly. For many years now the CAA has fudged ineffectually whilst
the BAA overspent on capital projects, giving rise to unnecessary price
increases for consumers using the 3 main London airports.
The latest proposals put forward last week by the BAA envisage that charges at
Stansted will triple as the BAA spends GBP4bn on a second runway at Stansted that
should cost no more than GBP1bn.
Commenting on these lunatic price increases being sought by the BAA, Ryanair's
Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
    "If ever proof were needed of the abject failure of the CAA to regulate the
     airport monopoly as it is legally obliged to do - "to promote the reasonable
     interests of users" - then these latest price increases demonstrate that
     failure. The very fact that an airport monopoly can seek the trebling of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair urge CAA act upon BAA
     prices from an ineffectual regulator shows that the CAA's regulatory regime
     in the UK has failed.
    "Ryanair calls again on the UK Government to break up the BAA airport
     monopoly. If Stansted, Gatwick and Heathrow were competing against each
     other, then a second runway and terminal would be built at Stansted for less
     than GBP1bn and not the crazy GBP4bn presently being proposed by the BAA.
    "If the CAA is unwilling "to promote the reasonable interests of users" and
     if it fails to restrain the price gouging instincts of the BAA airport
     monopoly, then the CAA should stand aside and let competition deliver where
     regulation has so clearly failed".

29 March 2006
                 RYANAIR LAUNCHES FIVE NEW ROUTES FROM SHANNON
                TO BIARRITZ, CARCASSONNE, FARO, KRAKOW & VENICE
           AND ALSO FREQUENCY INCREASES TO BARCELONA, MALAGA & MILAN
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 29th March 2006)
announced five new routes from its Shannon base to Biarritz and Carcassonne in
the South of France, Faro in Portugal, Krakow in Poland and Venice in Italy, as
well as increased frequency on routes from Shannon to Barcelona Malaga and
Milan. The new routes will start on 12th October and bring the total number of
destinations served by Ryanair in Shannon to 24.
In Shannon today, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
        "Ryanair's expansion makes Shannon one of the best served regions of its
         size anywhere in Europe and is a major boost to tourism and business in
         the mid-west, bringing 240 new jobs, 240,000 additional passengers and
         EUR55M more tourism spend.
        "From September, Ryanair will base a fourth Boeing 737-800 aircraft in
         Shannon, bringing our investment in Shannon to over $240M that will
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair announces new routes
         deliver 1.7M passengers per annum, sustain 1,700 jobs in the mid-west
         and allow passengers to enjoy savings of EUR170M compared to the high
         fares of Aer Lingus.
        "These five new routes are available today on www.ryanair.com and we
         advise passengers to book early as demand will be very strong".
Niall Gibbons, Director of Corporate Services and Policy, Tourism Ireland, said:
        "Overseas visitors performance from Europe was the powerhouse of tourism
         growth last year, fuelled largely by the excellent growth in air access
         by Ryanair and other carriers. The 40% increase in direct air access
         from Europe into the island of Ireland last summer underpinned a
         record-breaking performance from the European markets, which saw
         overseas visits grow by almost 20%. Tourism Ireland will continue with
         its policy of encouraging the best possible regional spread when
         carriers are considering introducing new routes and services. Our
         ultimate goal is to increase the number of overseas visitors to the
         island of Ireland in 2006 to 8.5 million and we look forward to working
         closely with Ryanair and other carriers to help achieve our goal."
Martin Moroney, Director of Shannon Airport said:
        "This is another exciting day for Shannon International Airport. The
         further development of Ryanair's Shannon base is a great boost for the
         airport and the region and further establishes Shannon as Ireland's low
         cost gateway. We are also delighted to see Ryanair add additional
         frequencies to their Barcelona, Malaga and Milan routes, as this proves
         the success of these routes in their first year of operation. We wish
         Ryanair every success with these additional routes and urge the business
         and tourist sector to fully capitalise on this increased connectivity to
         Europe".

                              RYANAIR ANNOUNCES -
                       REDUCTION IN ITS SERVICES TO CORK
                       NEW ROUTE FROM KERRY TO LIVERPOOL
Ryanair, Europe's leading low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 8th March 2006)
announced a reduction in its services to Cork Airport following recent cost
increases there. Cork Airport Authority recently announced a range of cost
increases (38 in total) for various services at the airport including a 300%
increase in the rental charge of check-in and ticket desks. These increases will
push up Ryanair's costs at the airport by over EUR30,000 per annum. The increases,
which are a direct result of the debt, which Cork Airport has inherited as a
result of its new, Taj Mahal-like, terminal now makes Cork Airport massively
uncompetitive against its peer airports throughout Europe and has made other
destinations for Ryanair much more attractive. The Liverpool to Cork route will
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair reduces Cork Services
reduce from 7 per week to 4 per week.
On the good news front Ryanair also announced that it will be starting a new
three times weekly service from Liverpool to Kerry as a much cheaper alternative
to Cork.
Announcing the reduction in services in Cork today, Ryanair's Deputy Chief
Executive, Michael Cawley, said
        "Cork Airport is in danger of pricing itself out of the market with
         these outrageous price increases. Cork Airport has to realise that it is
         in competition with hundreds of other airports throughout Europe for
         passengers whose only concern is to get low fares. The Cork Airport
         Authority has spent EUR180M on a terminal for 3 million passengers. Both
         Frankfurt Hahn and Dusseldorf Weeze built the same capacity for EUR13M and
         EUR15M respectively. If, by forcing the airport to assume the debt burden
         arising from this expenditure, the Government insists that Cork Airport
         is to charge a premium for its services then it will lose out on the
         hundreds of thousands of passengers which Ryanair and other airlines
         have brought to the region. For the sake of a cost increase of EUR30,000
         the region is going to lose 20,000 incoming tourists and business
         visitors, the income from which runs to approximately EUR8 million. This
         is an idiotic way to run an airport and is a direct result of the
         Government's transport policies of overspending and making its regional
         airports uncompetitive by building lavish and expensive facilities which
         passengers and visiting tourists are not prepared to pay for.
        "Consequently, Ryanair is reducing its services on the Liverpool route
         to reflect the reduction in demand which we expect will ensue from this
         cost increase.
        "The good news is that we are able to salvage the tourists with the help
         of Kerry Airport. We are delighted that we will now be moving these
         passengers to Kerry Airport who have offered us an extremely competitive
         cost base, much more reflective of what is available in Continental
         Europe and we are delighted that, while passengers may not be passing
         through Cork Airport, they will still be coming to the region, served
         through a much more efficient and low cost airport".

      RYANAIR MAKES IT A CENTURY WITH 100th AIRCRAFT DELIVERY FROM BOEING
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 7th March 2006)
celebrated the arrival of its 100th Boeing 737-800 series aircraft. Ryanair now
has an all Boeing 737-800 series fleet with an average age of just 2 years
making Ryanair's fleet the youngest of any major airline in Europe.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "Ryanair's 100 brand new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft will bring
         Europe's lowest fares and best customer service to over 40 M passengers
         across 22 countries in 2006.
        "In 2005, thanks to the reliability and efficiency of our next
         generation Boeing 737-800 fleet our customers enjoyed:
           The lowest airfares in Europe
            The fewest delays in Europe
            The least number of cancellations in Europe
        "Ryanair's $7.5BN programme to replace our older Boeing 737-200 aircraft
         with the environmentally efficient Boeing 737-800 aircraft has also
         resulted in a:
          50% reduction in CO2 emissions per seat
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 100 Aircraft Delivery
           45% reduction in fuel burn per seat
           45% reduction in noise emissions
        "Over the next 6 years Ryanair will receive a further 139 new Boeing
         737-800 aircraft, bringing the total fleet to 239 aircraft and enabling
         70M passengers p.a. to enjoy Europe's lowest fares".

   RYANAIR CARRIES MORE PASSENGERS THAN BRITISH AIRWAYS' WORLDWIDE TRAFFIC IN
                                     FEBRUARY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Monday, 6th March 2006)
confirmed that it had carried more passengers than British Airways for a fourth
time in February, proving that British Airways can't match Ryanair's prices, its
punctuality and its "no fuel surcharge" guarantee.
In February, Ryanair carried 2.59M passengers, 70,000 more than British Airways'
entire worldwide traffic and almost 1M more than British Airways on its European
routes.
The traffic figures also show that British Airways' load factor of just 61% on
its European routes (where it competes with Ryanair) lags 10 percentage points
behind the rest of its network and worse still is 17 percentage points lower
than Ryanair's Europe wide load factor of 78%.
Ryanair Holdings PLC More Passengers than BA
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications, said:
        "These traffic statistics for February highlight what the travelling
         public has always known, namely wherever there is a choice between
         Ryanair and British Airways, passengers prefer Ryanair, the low fare,
         on-time airline, compared to British Airways, the high fare, usually
         late, fuel surcharging airline.
        "Passengers want low fares and that is why Ryanair is now the World's
         Favourite Airline. British Airways is failing because it can't match
         Ryanair's low fares and on-time performance".

             IT'S OFFICIAL - RYANAIR IS NO. 1 FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 22nd February 2006)
welcomed the just released AEA and Ryanair figures for customer service in 2005.
Speaking today, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "The comparison between AEA, Ryanair and Easyjet customer service
         statistics clearly shows that for the third year in a row Ryanair is the
         most punctual major airline in Europe with the most on time flights, the
         fewest cancellations and least lost bags.
        "The report confirms:
          Flights:         During 2005, nearly 3 in 10 passengers
                            who chose British Airways were delayed compared
                            to just 1 out of 10 with Ryanair.
          Mislaid bags:    During 2005, 35 passengers in
                            every 2,000 flying with British Airways had
                            their bag mislaid compared to just 1 in every
                            2,000 with Ryanair.
          Cancellations:   During 2005, 12 in every 800
                            British Airways flights were cancelled, compared
                            to less than 5 in every 800 with Ryanair.
        "The report also confirms what millions of European consumers already

         on-times, fly Ryanair".

                   RYANAIR WELCOMES ITALIAN COURT'S DECISION
                          TO PUT PEOPLE BEFORE PARCELS
Ryanair, Italy's second largest airline today (Friday, 10th February 2006)
welcomed the decision of the TAR Lazio court to grant an injunction to Ryanair
that will prevent Italian passengers and visitors to Rome from being diverted to
Rome Fiumicino while flights continue to land in Rome Ciampino.
Since the beginning of January, 7 Ryanair flights (on Ciampino based aircraft)
returning shortly after midnight were diverted to Fiumicino. These diversions
forced over 1,000 Italian consumers and visitors to land in Fiumicino, when
their friends and relatives and their onward transport was awaiting them in
Ciampino. A further 1,000 passengers had their flights the following morning
delayed as aircraft were positioned from Fiumicino to Ciampino.
Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:

        "We welcome the decision of the TAR to put people before parcels by
         allowing passengers on Ryanair based aircraft to land in Rome Ciampino.
        "Ryanair is committed to using its new quieter aircraft to minimise
         noise generation at Rome Ciampino. We are now talking to ADR about a
         noise reduction programme for the benefit of the local community.
        "Today we have again written to ENAC requesting a meeting to resolve
         this issue and to ensure no more Italian citizens or visitors are
         diverted unnecessarily to Fiumicino on planes that are based in
         Ciampino, while their friends and relatives are waiting for them in
         Ciampino".
Note to Editors:
Since Jan 2004, 5 Ryanair aircraft have been based permanently in Ciampino.
These have generated 160 direct Ryanair jobs in Ciampino. More than 3000 jobs
have been created thanks to the 3M passengers that Ryanair delivers annually in
Rome Ciampino. Ryanair's low fares have made Rome, Europe's fastest growing city
break destination.

              RYANAIR DELIVERS INCREASED 3RD QUARTER PROFITS
                 NET PROFIT OF EUR37M - TRAFFIC GROWTH OF 26%
 =-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Monday, 6th February 2006)
announced increased third quarter profits of EUR37m. Traffic grew by 26% to 8.6m
passengers, whilst yields were almost flat, as expected, as total revenues rose
by 27% to EUR370.7m. Unit costs increased by 3% (excluding fuel they fell by 6%)
as fuel costs rose by 59% to EUR114.9m. As a result of these significantly higher
fuel costs, Ryanair's after tax margin, on an adjusted basis for the third
quarter fell by 2 points to 10% as adjusted net profit increased by 6% to EUR37m.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results
Note 1: Adjusted profit after tax for the quarter ended December 31, 2004
excludes an amount of EUR11.9m (net of tax) resulting from changes in the
accounting treatment for Goodwill arising on the Buzz acquisition following the
adoption of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards).
Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
"Ryanair's lowest fare model, yet again, delivered increased profits and
passenger growth for the quarter despite the intense competition and the drag on
profitability of very high fuel prices. Underlying profit growth was strong at
22% as the comparative included the once off release of maintenance provisions
related to the return of leased aircraft in November 2004. The Ryanair model has
proven that during difficult trading conditions that it can increase
profitability and generate significant passenger growth while many of our
competitors are reporting falling profits or losing money.
"As anticipated, yields were flat during the quarter despite a 27% increase in
seat capacity and continued intense price competition across the route network.
The multiple fuel surcharges imposed by European flag carriers remain, and have
maintained the wide gap between their high prices and Ryanair's low fares. Our
"no fuel surcharges" guarantee to our passengers has enabled us to launch more
new routes, deliver significant traffic growth and higher profits. Load factors,
as expected, were 1 point lower driven by the 27% increase in seat capacity as
we launched 34 new routes( total routes 303) and announced a significant
expansion at our Dublin base, ( total bases 15). Ancillary revenues grew by 31%
significantly faster than the growth in passenger volumes and we expect that
they will continue to outpace traffic growth this year.
"Unit costs increased by 3% primarily due to higher fuel costs. Excluding fuel,
unit costs were reduced by 6% thanks to the addition of lower cost and efficient
Boeing 737-800's (we retired the last older Boeing 737-200 in December 2005),
new lower cost airport and base agreements and continuing tight control over all
other cost lines. We continue to focus aggressively on costs and anticipate that
the cost reductions will continue to partially offset the significantly higher
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results
oil prices.
"Our fuel costs rose by 59% to EUR115m despite being almost fully hedged during
the quarter reflecting the high fuel prices. We are hedged to the end of March
06 at rates equivalent to $49 per barrel. We are unhedged thereafter but
continue to monitor forward prices with a view to hedging our future
requirements for fiscal 2007 should an appropriate opportunity arise. Our view
remains unchanged insofar as we expect that fuel prices will continue at these
higher levels for some time.
"Our new routes and bases (Luton, Liverpool and Pisa) have performed well in
their first winter whilst our yield performance at Shannon continues to be lower
than originally expected. Our 14th base at Nottingham - East Midlands which was
due to launch in March has been postponed to April due to the late aircraft
deliveries arising from the Boeing strike. We also announced a major expansion
of our Dublin base which commences in April with 5 additional aircraft and 18
new routes and these are already booking strongly. Ryanair continues to benefit
from the cost savings and the economies of scale arising from our route
development strategy of "connecting the dots". We also continued to extend our
lead over British Airways by carrying more passengers each month than they did
on their entire worldwide network.
"We continue to oppose the GBP4bn "marble palace" being proposed by BAA at
Stansted. All the main airlines support a second runway, but believe that this
should be delivered at a cost of GBP1bn or less. The recent dialogue with the BAA
has conclusively demonstrated that their 76m passenger forecast for Stansted
(current capacity 25m) has no basis in reality. The BAA GBP4bn budget is a
monumental waste of passengers money and the BAA are also looking for a
cross-subsidy from passengers at Heathrow and Gatwick to pay for this Taj-Mahal.
If the CAA were an effective regulator, these plans would be shelved as they
fail to meet the reasonable requirements of airport users, but sadly the CAA is
a weak regulator whose bark is even more ineffectual than its toothless bite.
"Our relentless focus on cost reduction continues. The launch of our Web
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results
Check-In, hand luggage only facility on March 16 will continue the low fare
revolution pioneered by Ryanair in the early 1990's. Web check-in will encourage
passengers to travel with fewer bags and will enable Ryanair to reduce airport
handling charges as we will need fewer check-in agents, desks, and baggage
handlers. We plan to pass on these savings upfront to our passengers by reducing
our average fare by GBP2.50 or EUR3.50 from 16th of March onwards. Web check-in
passengers will further benefit by avoiding airport check-in and boarding gate
queues. Passengers who wish to check-in bags will also benefit from these fare
reductions and shorter queues at check-in but will pay GBP2.50 or EUR3.50 per
checked in bag. We anticipate that the introduction of web check-in and at the
same time increasing passengers baggage allowance to an industry leading 30kgs,
will substantially reduce excess baggage charges. We estimate that the
introduction of web check-in will be revenue neutral; however, we believe it
will enable us to reduce Airport & Handling costs by up to EUR30m per annum.
"We remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fourth quarter. We
expect to achieve significant increases in passenger volumes but also anticipate
that yields in Q4 will fall reflecting our large capacity growth in this weakest
winter quarter as well as the impact of Easter falling in April (it was in March
last year). These factors should result in yields being towards the middle of
the range of -5% to -10%, previously guided. Our full year net profit guidance
is therefore unchanged. Intense competition in the market continues, however,
Ryanair's unique combination of the lowest fare in every market, lowest cost
base and industry leading customer service including our recently announced web
check-in initiative will enable us to continue to pioneer the next phase of the
low fares revolution".

The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
quarter year ended December 31, 2005 on 3rd February, 2006.
3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
    --------------------------------------
 The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the quarter ended December
 31, 2005 and the comparative period are based on the results reported under the
 group's preliminary IFRS accounting policies, as adjusted certain for
 exceptional items.
4. Ancillary Products and Services
    -------------------------------
 In order to more accurately reflect the structure of certain ancillary contracts
 and to provide more meaningful information to users the Group has taken the
 opportunity to reclassify certain ancillary revenues and costs (primarily car
 hire and travel insurance). This has resulted in a reduction in revenues of
 EUR24.2 million with a corresponding reduction in costs in the period ended 31
 December 2005 (31 December 2004: EUR13.5million). This has resulted in an increase
 in net margin of 0.4% to 20.4% in the period ended 31 December 2005 (31 December
 2004 0.3% to 23.4%). Going forward the Group intends to report ancillary
 revenues and costs on a basis consistent with the treatment described herein."
5. Purchase Accounting adjustment
    ------------------------------
 Subsequent to the acquisition of Buzz Stansted in April 2003 Ryanair
 renegotiated the terms and conditions of onerous aircraft leases and agreed to
 return the aircraft to the lessors in late 2004, thereby releasing Ryanair from
 any remaining lease obligations at that time. Irish GAAP permitted that such an
 adjustment could be made to the provisional value of the assets and liabilities
 acquired as part of the original business combination; provided that the
 adjustment was made either in the reporting period that the combination took
 place or the first full financial period following the transaction. IFRS 3,
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -6-
 however, only allows such an adjustment to be made in the 12 month period
 following the acquisition, and accordingly, as the event occurred more than 12
 months after the acquisition date, under IFRS this adjustment is made to the
 Group's income statement instead. This gives rise to a credit of EUR11.9m to the
 income statement in the quarter to 31 December 2004.

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
                  ---------------------------------------------
                                  Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted income statement excluding exceptional items referred to below.
Exceptional items for the nine months ended December 31, 2005 consist of a
receipt of EUR5.2m (net of tax) in quarter 1 arising from the settlement of an
insurance claim for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Following the adoption of IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) the
Company was obliged to change its accounting treatment for Business
acquisitions. This has resulted in a one-off, non-cash release of EUR11.9m in the
quarter ended December 31, 2004 (see note 5).
Profit after tax and adjusted profit after tax increased by 6% to EUR36.8m during
the quarter compared to last year. The adjusted profit for the nine months ended
December 31, 2005, excluding exceptional items, increased by 16% to EUR273.8m.
The results for the period and comparative year have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standard ("IFRS") accounting policies
expected to be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -4-
March 2006, and a detailed explanation of the financial impact of the adoption
of these policies was set out in a separate document issued with the quarterly
financial results for the period to 30 June 2005.
Summary Quarter ended December 31, 2005
=--------------------------------------
Profit after tax increased by 6% to EUR36.8m, compared to EUR34.8m in the previous
quarter ended December 31, 2004. These results were achieved by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, excluding fuel, which was
significantly higher than in the comparative period. Total operating revenues
increased by 27% to EUR370.7m, which is greater than the 26% growth in passenger
volumes, as average fares were almost flat and ancillary revenues grew by 31% to
EUR59.0m. Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 1% whilst Passenger
Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 83% during the period.
Total operating expenses increased by 32% to EUR321.5m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges, maintenance
costs, and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Fuel, which represents 36% of total operating costs compared to 30% last year,
increased by 59% to EUR114.9m due to substantial increases in the US$ cost per
gallon, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro to US$ exchange rate.
Unit costs excluding fuel declined by 6% as all other major cost items increased
at a slower rate than the growth in passenger volumes. This is despite the
impact on last year's comparative figures of the release of maintenance
provisions of EUR5.2m arising from the return of 6 leased Boeing 737-300's to the
lessor. Due to the significantly higher fuel costs operating margins declined by
4 points to 13%, whilst operating profit increased by 2% to EUR49.2m.
Profit before tax has increased by 5%, higher than the growth in operating
profit due to the slower rate of growth in net interest charges and a gain
arising from the sale of the remaining 737-200 aircraft.
Net Margins declined by 2 points to 10% for the reasons outlined above.
Adjusted basic earnings per share have risen by 5% to 4.79 cent for the period.

Balance Sheet
=------------
Total Cash increased by EUR169.5m to EUR1,775.2m since March 31, 2005 but represents
a decline in the quarter of EUR33.5m due to funding an additional EUR183.9m in
capital expenditure from internal resources. Gross capital expenditure in the
period amounted to EUR304.1m as the company took delivery of 12 Boeing 737-800
aircraft and funded additional aircraft deposits during the period. Capital
expenditure was part funded by the drawdown of long term debt, Total debt net of
repayments increased during the period by 120.1m. The exercise of share options
during the period, mainly granted to pilots contributed a further EUR28.9m in cash
during the period. Shareholders' Funds at Dec 31, 2005 have increased by EUR216.0m
to EUR1,950.5m, compared to March 31, 2005 reflecting the EUR279.0m increase in
profitability during the period offset by a reduction of EUR91.9m resulting from
changes in the accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments,
pensions and stock options following the adoption of IFRS.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis quarter year ended Dec 31, 2005
=---------------------------------------------------------------
Profit after tax, increased by 6% to EUR36.8m due to a 1% increase in average
revenue per passenger, and tight cost control which was offset by fuel costs
increasing by 59% to EUR114.9m during the period. Operating margins, declined by 4
points due to higher fuel costs and lower than normal maintenance charges in
quarter 3 last year due to the release of EUR5.2m of maintenance provisions.
Operating profit increased by 2% to EUR49.2m compared to quarter year ended Dec
31, 2004.
Total operating revenues increased by 27% to EUR370.7m due to the combination of a
26% increase in passengers carried and a 1% improvement in average revenue per
passenger.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 26% to EUR311.7m due to a 1% improvement
in average fares, increased passenger volumes on existing routes, and the
successful launch of new routes and new bases at Liverpool, Luton and Pisa. Load

factor decreased by 1 point to 83% during the period.
Ancillary revenues continue to perform strongly as revenues grew by 31% to
EUR59.0m in the period. This performance reflects the strong growth in on board
sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and internet income. Ancillary revenues
continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and now account for 16%
of total revenues compared to 15% last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 32% to EUR321.5m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, maintenance costs, aircraft
rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth
of the airline. The comparative maintenance costs for quarter ended December 31,
2004 were positively impacted by the release of maintenance provisions of EUR5.2m
arising from the return of 6 leased 737-300 aircraft.
Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by a 10% increase in the
average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partly offset by the
strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US dollar.
Staff costs have increased by 17% to EUR41.1m. This increase primarily reflects an
increase in average employed and the impact of pay increases of 3% granted
during the period.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 10% to EUR28.7m. There are an

additional eight 'owned' 737-800 aircraft in the fleet this year compared to
last year. The resultant higher depreciation charge was offset by a combination
of lower amortisation due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the positive
impact of a new engine maintenance agreement on the cost of amortisation of
737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a positive
impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 59% to EUR114.9m due to a 32% increase in the number of hours
flown, a significant increase in the average US$ cost per gallon of fuel
partially offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the
US dollar during the period.
Maintenance costs increased by EUR8.0m to EUR10.3m reflecting an increase in the
size of the fleet operated, and an increase in the number of hours flown offset
by maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from the higher
proportion of 737-800 operated. The return of 6 leased 737-300's to ILFC in
quarter 3 of last year resulted in the release of EUR5.2m in maintenance
provisions. Excluding the impact of the release of these provisions, maintenance
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -5-
costs would have increased by 37%, in line with the growth of leased aircraft
fleet.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by EUR0.1m to EUR2.4m due to the
reduction in the level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to
the previous year.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 39% to EUR10.3m reflecting an average of 6
additional aircraft on lease during the period partially offset by the savings
arising from the return of 6 leased 737-300 aircraft to ILFC.
Route charges increased by 22% to EUR40.8m due to an increase in the number
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length, offset by a reduction
in enroute charges in certain EU countries and the benefit of a stronger euro to
sterling exchange rate.
Airport and handling charges increased by 22% to EUR54.0m, which is lower than the
growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports and bases.
Other expenses declined by 3% to EUR19.1m, due mainly to savings on various
indirect costs and improved margins and on some new and existing ancillary
revenue products.
Operating margins have declined by 4 points to 13% for the period due to the
reasons outlined above, however despite this, operating profits have increased
by 2% to EUR49.2m.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR2.1m to EUR9.5m due to the combined impact
of a higher cash balance and increases in average deposit rates during the
period.
Interest payable increased by EUR3.3m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the
purchase of new aircraft during the period.
Gains on disposal of assets were EUR0.9m arising from the disposal of the
remaining 737-200 aircraft during the period.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis nine months Ended December 31, 2005
=-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -5-
Profit after tax, increased by 16% to EUR273.8m due to average fares increasing by
2% and strong ancillary revenue growth, which was offset by fuel costs which
increased by 89% to EUR351.8m reflecting the higher US$ cost per gallon. Operating
margins, as a result, fell by 3 points to 25%, which in turn resulted in
operating profit increasing by 17% to EUR331.3m compared to the previous nine
months ended December 31 2004.
Total operating revenues increased by 31% to EUR1,316.9m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 28% to EUR26.7m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 3% in the
quarter due to a combination of higher average fares and strong ancillary
revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 31% to EUR1,128.5m due to a combination
of increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Liverpool, Luton and Pisa and a 2% increase in average fares.
Ancillary revenues increased 37% to EUR188.4m, a faster growth rate than passenger
volumes, reflecting a strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues,
on-board sales and other ancillary products.
Total operating expenses increased by 37% to EUR985.6m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route
charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of the
airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by an increase in
the average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partially offset
by the strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US$.
Staff costs have increased by 19% to EUR124.7m primarily due to a 15% increase in
average employee numbers to 2,963 and the impact of pay increases of 3% compared
to the previous nine months ended December 31, 2004.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 15% to EUR81.7m. A higher depreciation
charge arose due to an increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from 64 to 77,
partially offset by, a lower amortisation charge due to the retirement of
737-200 aircraft and the positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the
cost of amortisation of 737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the Euro to US$
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -5-
also had a positive impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge relating
to new aircraft deliveries.
Fuel costs rose by 89% to EUR351.8m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, an 10% increase in sector length, and a significantly higher average US$
cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the positive impact of the
strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the period.
Maintenance costs increased by 30% to EUR35.4m reflecting the improved reliability
arising from the higher proportion of 737-800 operated and a lower level of
maintenance costs incurred due to the return of six 737-300's partially offset
by an increase in the number of leased 737-800 aircraft from 10 to 17.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 17% to EUR11.1m due to the reduction
in the level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to the
previous year.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 31% to EUR31.0m reflecting an additional 7
aircraft on lease during the period offset by the savings arising from the
return of 6 737-300's to ILFC.
Route charges increased by 23% to EUR124.7m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown and an increase of 10% in the average sector length, offset by a
reduction in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 22% to EUR164.0m, which was slower than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 8% to EUR61.1m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products, and cost
reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 3 points to 25% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 17% to EUR331.3m during the
period.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR7.1m to EUR27.3m for the period due to the
combined impact of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -5-
average deposit rates earned in the period compared to last year.
Interest payable increased by EUR14.1m to EUR55.1m due to the drawdown of debt to
part fund the purchase of new aircraft.
Foreign exchange losses have decreased during the nine months to EUR0.2m due to
the positive impact of changes in the Sterling and US Dollar exchange rates
against the Euro compared to last year.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to reflect the significant capital
expenditure programme being undertaken by the group. An additional 11 aircraft
were delivered during the period which in conjunction with the payment of
deposits on future deliveries accounted for the bulk of EUR304.1m spent on capital
expenditure during the last 9 months. During the same period the Company
generated cash from operating activities of EUR310.1m. that part funded the
capital expenditure programme with the balance reflected in Total Cash of
EUR1,775.2m. The exercise of share options, primarily by pilots generated a
further EUR28.9 cash for the Group. Long term Debt, net of repayments increased by
EUR120.1m during the period.
Shareholders' Funds at December 31, 2005 have increased by EUR216.0m to EUR1,950.5m,
compared to March 31, 2005 reflecting the EUR279.0m increase in profitability
during the period offset by a reduction of EUR91.9m resulting from changes in the
accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments, pensions and stock
options following the adoption of IFRS.

25 January 2006
                  RYANAIR TO REVOLUTIONISE EUROPEAN AIR TRAVEL
- FARES REDUCED BY 9% (GBP2.50 OR EUR3.50) FROM 16TH MARCH '06
- WEB CHECK-IN TO ELIMINATE CHECK-IN AND AIRPORT QUEUES
- LUGGAGE ALLOWANCES INCREASED FROM 25KGS TO 30KGS
- PASSENGERS ONLY PAY FOR THE BAGGAGE SERVICE THEY USE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 25th January 2006)
announced details of its next revolution in European low fare air travel. From
the 16th March, Ryanair will introduce a number of key service improvements for
all passengers including (1) all Ryanair's fares will be reduced by 9% (GBP2.50 or
EUR3.50), (2) all passengers travelling with hand luggage and in possession of an
EU passport will be able to check-in on the web at www.ryanair.com and by-pass
all check-in and airport queues, (3) these passengers will also be given
priority boarding which will also eliminate boarding gate queues as well, (4)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Revolutionise Travel
for bookings after 16th March, Ryanair is increasing each passenger's luggage
allowance from the current 25kgs to 30 kgs (comprising 10kgs carry-on and 20kgs
checked-in luggage) which will substantially reduce excess baggage fees and
finally (5) all passengers travelling with checked in luggage who book after
16th March will now pay a fee of GBP2.50 (EUR3.50) per bag, per flight if booked in
advance on the website, or GBP5.00 (EUR7.00) per bag, per flight if presented
unbooked at the airport.
As a result of these changes, those 25% of Ryanair's passengers who presently
travel with just hand luggage will avail of lower fares, will avoid the
inconvenience of check-in or boarding gate queues and will no longer cross
subsidise those passengers travelling with checked in luggage. A further 50% of
Ryanair's current traffic (who travel with just one checked in bag) will see no
change in their cost of travel, as the GBP2.50 ticket price reduction will fund
their GBP2.50 baggage fee if booked on the internet. These passengers will enjoy
much shorter queues at check-in thanks to the large numbers of people who will
now switch to web check-in, thereby reducing the airport check-in queues. Lastly
those passengers who presently travel with more than one checked in bag will see
the cost of their travel rise by the GBP2.50 (EUR3.50) per bag for their second and
subsequent bags. These passengers will also enjoy shorter check-in queues, and
will be encouraged to travel with less checked in luggage which would then make
these changes cost neutral for them as well.
This 9% "across the board" reduction in Ryanair's ticket prices from 16th March
will make these changes revenue neutral for Ryanair. The airline estimates that
the reduction in ticket revenues and excess baggage fees will cost Ryanair more
than GBP100m per annum. These lower fares will stimulate further traffic growth
and increase the current (50%) price differential between Ryanair's prices and
the average ticket prices of our higher fare competitors such as Easyjet. We
expect as a result of these measures, and in particular the attraction of web
check-in and priority boarding that more and more of Ryanair's customers will be
incentivised to travel with hand luggage only and take advantage of Ryanair's
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Revolutionise Travel
industry leading 10kgs of carry-on luggage.
The upside for Ryanair in these initiatives will be the opportunity to
significantly reduce airport and handling costs. We believe that between 40% to
50% of passengers will quickly switch to our new web check-in/priority boarding
service. This will allow Ryanair to reduce the number of check-in desks, baggage
hall and other handling facilities we rent at major airports. It will
significantly reduce the number of check-in and baggage handling staff required
to handle individual flights, although the airline expects few reductions in
staffing numbers in these areas, as existing numbers will be required to handle
our rapid growth. Ryanair believes that its airport and handling costs will be
reduced by over 10%, which equate to a saving of some EUR30m. This saving would
equate to 10% of Ryanair's current year forecast after tax profits.
Announcing these changes in London, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's Chief Executive
said:
    "Many sceptics have doubted whether Ryanair could drive its fares even
     lower. Well today we prove the doubters wrong. From 16th March next, Ryanair
     will reduce its fares by almost 10% across the board. Ryanair will also
     become the first low fares airline in Europe to make web check-in available
     for all our customers and we believe that this service will prove enormously
     attractive to passengers who wish to avoid those frustrating queues at
     airport check-in, at security, and at the boarding gate as well.
    "These changes will also be welcomed by the overwhelming majority of our
     remaining passengers who will still be checking in one bag, as these
     passengers will enjoy lower air fares, but also shorter and faster moving
     queues at airport check-in. We have no doubt that this pioneering
     development for checked in bags is the way forward, as it will encourage and
     incentivise more passengers on short-haul journeys to travel with hand
     luggage only. Ryanair's higher carry-on limit of 10kgs, and our new
     increased checked in allowance of 20kgs will largely eliminate excess
     baggage charges.
    "These changes will enable Ryanair to reduce our airport and handling costs
     across the network. We will require fewer and less expensive airport
     facilities such as airport check-in and baggage hall facilities. We will
     carry fewer bags making our aircraft lighter and improving our fuel
     consumption. Our existing check-in and baggage handling personnel will now
     be able to accommodate significantly greater traffic numbers as we aim to
     double the size of the airline over the coming five years.
    "Ryanair started the low fares revolution in Europe back in 1990. We have
     continued to pioneer changes in both the cost and practice of air travel
     over the past 15 years. Today's announcement takes this revolution one step
     further. With a 9% reduction in Europe's lowest air fares and the first web
     check-in facility for low fare passengers, we believe that up to half of
     Ryanair's passengers will now be encouraged to avoid airport queues.
     Short-haul travel in Europe will never have been cheaper or more convenient
     than Ryanair will make it this year".

                               Ryanair Statement
Ryanair this morning (Wednesday, 18th January 2006) confirmed that its schedule
of flights was operating normally, on-time and with no cancellations. Ryanair
criticised a false rumour which emanated from one of the London investment banks
shortly after 7.30am, which suggested that Ryanair's flight schedule was subject
to widespread cancellation. This rumour was untrue and could have been verified
by that bank, had they made any attempt to contact the airline directly, or had
they checked Ryanair's flight information page on www.ryanair.com, which
confirmed that all Ryanair's early morning departures from London Luton and
Stansted airport had departed as normal and on-time.
Ryanair regrets that such a false and inaccurate rumour would emanate from a
respected London investment bank without any attempt made to verify the facts
either directly with the company or on Ryanair's website.

                           RYANAIR LAUNCHES 18 ROUTES
                              FROM DUBLIN TO EUROPE
                  INCREASES FLIGHTS ON 7 DUBLIN - EUROPE ROUTES
                      5 NEW AIRCRAFT BASED AT DUBLIN IN 2006
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 21st December
2005) announced the last of its new route announcements for Summer 2006 by
selecting Dublin Airport as effectively its 16th European base. Ryanair which is
now Ireland's largest airline has until today largely confined its operations at
Dublin Airport to UK routes. However, from April 2006 the airline will base 5
new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft in Dublin. These new aircraft will generate
over 250 direct Ryanair jobs at Dublin Airport, they will allow Ryanair to open
up 18 new routes from Dublin to Continental Europe, frequencies will also
increase on 8 existing Dublin-Europe routes and this additional capacity will
allow Ryanair's traffic at Dublin to grow from 51/2m to 7m passengers annually
Ryanair Holdings PLC Launch of 18 New Routes
as Ryanair moves next year from 35m to over 40m passengers per annum.
                        New Routes from Dublin - 2006
     FRANCE - Marseille, Nantes and La Rochelle
     GERMANY - Baden (Stuttgart) and Hamburg
     POLAND - Krakow, Poznan and Wroclaw
     ITALY - Milan and Venice
     SWEDEN - Gothenburg and Malmo
     SPAIN - Valencia
     PORTUGAL - Porto
     AUSTRIA - Salzburg
     SLOVAKIA - Bratislava
     LITHUANIA - Kaunas
     UK - Humberside
                   Increased frequencies from Dublin - 2006
     Dublin - Frankfurt increases to twice daily
     Dublin - Barcelona increases to daily
     Dublin - Faro increases to daily
     Dublin - Cardiff increases to 10 per week
     Dublin - Malaga increases to 8 per week
     Dublin - Carcassonne increases to 5 per week
     Dublin - Biarritz increases to 4 per week
     Dublin - Lodz increases to 3 per week
These new routes and frequencies at Dublin Airport will see Ryanair's traffic
into/out of Ireland rise to over 9m passengers annually over the coming year,
almost 30% more than Aer Lingus in terms of passengers carried to/from the
island of Ireland. These new routes will also afford Irish consumers and
visitors the opportunity of travelling between Ireland and Europe at low fares
which are half the price of Aer Lingus's tickets and with frequencies that are
in most cases greater than the frequencies offered by Aer Lingus.
These new aircraft will be based at the new temporary boarding facility, which
will be available at Dublin Airport from the end of May 2006. In time these
routes and aircraft will operate from the new Pier D facility when opened in
Summer 2007. Ryanair will now be working closely with the DAA to ensure that the
new facilities at Dublin Airport are developed on-time and within budget.
Speaking today in Dublin at the announcement of the development of these new
routes from Dublin to Europe, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
    "This is a momentous day for Ryanair, the Dublin Airport Authority and Irish
     tourism. This is the largest ever single investment in Irish tourism. The 5
     new aircraft to be based in Dublin represent an investment of over $300m.
     The 18 new routes from Dublin to Europe, together with the additional
     flights on 7 existing routes will mean an additional 1.5m passengers p.a. at
     Dublin Airport, over 1 million of which will be inbound visitors for Irish
     tourism. Irish consumers can now look forward to high frequency, low fare
     access to a wide network of destinations direct from Dublin to Austria,
     France, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden
Ryanair Holdings PLC Launch of 18 New Routes
     and the UK. All of these flights go on sale today at www.ryanair.com at
     prices that are half the high fares being charged by Aer Lingus. Ryanair
     will continue to offer Irish consumers and visitors substantially lower
     fares from Dublin to Europe than the high fare services presently operated
     by Aer Lingus.
    "These new routes from Dublin to Europe mean that Ryanair's operations at
     Dublin Airport will become substantially larger than Aer Lingus. Ryanair
     will carry over 7m passengers on 52 routes from Dublin next year compared to
     Aer Lingus's less than 6m passengers on just 43 year round routes. Ryanair's
     average fare of EUR39 is less than half Aer Lingus's average European fare of
     EUR80. Ryanair now offers more routes and services than Aer Lingus to both the
     UK and now Continental Europe.
    "With these new routes and passengers, Ryanair will now carry more
     passengers than Aer Lingus at each of the main Irish airports (Dublin, Cork
     and Shannon) as well as serving the bigger regional airports (Derry, Kerry
     and Knock) which Aer Lingus no longer operate to. Ryanair is now twice the
     size and just half the price of Aer Lingus here in Ireland, and has long
     since displaced any claims Aer Lingus might have had to being Ireland's
     national airline. Aer Lingus's only remaining title is that of Ireland's
     "highest fare" airline. Aer Lingus can't compete with Ryanair's prices, they
     can't match our punctuality, and now they can't match our route network from
     Dublin to the UK or Europe".

                       RYANAIR DELAYS ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT
    AT EAST MIDLANDS AND PISA BASES FOR A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS DUE TO DELAY IN
                                BOEING DELIVERIES
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 20th December 2005)
announced a number of changes to its flying programme during January, February
and March 2006 to accommodate the late delivery of new aircraft from Boeing, and
Ryanair's decision to retire the existing fleet of 737-200's on schedule at the
end of December. These cancellations will reduce Ryanair's passenger traffic by
approximately 100,000 passengers per month during January, February and March
and will reduce the overall passenger traffic in the current fiscal year to just
under 35 million passengers.
As a result of a strike in Boeing during September and October, all of Ryanair's
aircraft deliveries this Winter are being delivered approximately 1 month after
their scheduled date. Ryanair has been able to meet this 4 aircraft shortfall
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair delays Aircraft
during October, November and December by extending the flying programme on a
number of older 737-200 series aircraft due for retirement. It is not possible
to extend the use of these aircraft beyond the end of December 2005, as the
aircraft have been sold and the pilots have been retrained on the 737-800's. The
airline has therefore decided to trim its schedule temporarily through January,
February and March 2006. Planned capacity will return to normal with the
delivery of the last 4 aircraft from Boeing during the month of April 2005.
These aircraft constraints will result in the following schedule changes during
the first 3 months of 2006:
   The cancellation of 200 rotations per month (approx. 1% the total flying
     programme) during January, February and March.
    The delay of the launch of the second aircraft at the Nottingham East
     Midlands base from 7th March to 5th April.
    The delay of the launch of the second aircraft at the Pisa base from 12th
     January to 4th April.
All passengers currently effected by these cancelled flights or the 2 month
delay in new flights at the East Midlands and Pisa bases will be notified at
least 3 weeks in advance of the original date of travel and will be offered
either re-accommodation on an alternative Ryanair flight, re-accommodation on
the new routes from East Midlands and Pisa when launched, or a full refund of
their air fares.
Commenting on these cancellations during the first 3 months of next year,
Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley said;
    "We very much regret having to reduce our schedule to allow for the late
     delivery of new aircraft from Boeing and the planned retirement of our older
     737-200's in December. These aircraft have already been sold. We apologise
     sincerely to all our passengers who may be inconvenienced by these schedule
     changes, and we look forward to welcoming them on board the new flights from
     East Midlands and Pisa when the new aircraft are delivered and based there
     during April 2006.
    "These schedule changes will not effect Ryanair's profit guidance for the
     fiscal year ended March 31, 2006."

        RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW 10 YEAR AGREEMENT WITH BRUSSELS CHARLEROI
                        5 NEW ROUTES AND $240M INVESTMENT
NEW ROUTES FROM BRUSSELS TO FARO, NIMES, MALAGA, SALZBURG, VALENCIA
                      1 MILLION FREE* SEAT SALE TO CELEBRATE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 14th December 2005)
announced a new 10 year agreement committing it to develop Brussels Charleroi
Airport until 2016. As part of this agreement Ryanair will base a 4th aircraft
in Charleroi, bringing its total investment in aircraft at Brussels Charleroi to
$240M. The airline will open 5 new routes, from Brussels to Faro, Nimes, Malaga,
Salzburg and Valencia from April 2006 onwards, bringing the total number of
Ryanair routes from Brussels Charleroi to 16. These 5 new routes will deliver
another quarter of a million passengers p.a. and bring Ryanair's annual traffic
at Charleroi to 2.3M .
Announcing this new agreement, and Ryanair's increased investment in BSCA,
Ryanair Holdings PLC 10yr agreement Brussels
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's CEO said:
        "Our new 10 year deal with Brussels Charleroi Airport commits Ryanair to
         invest $240M in new aircraft and deliver 2.3M passengers p.a. These 2.3M
         passengers will save EUR230M annually over the high fares charged at
         Zaventem Airport and based on ACI** figures these passengers will
         generate 2,300 jobs at the airport and in the local Walloon region. In
         addition, visitors brought to the region by Ryanair's low fares will
         spend over EUR200M p.a.
        "In 2001, Ryanair launched its first base in continental Europe at
         Brussels Charleroi and since then it has transformed Charleroi from an
         unknown, unused airfield into the fastest growing airport in Belgium.
         BSCA for its part has responded by recently announcing plans for a new
         terminal capable of handling 5M passengers p.a. which will be opened in
         2007.
        "The passenger growth at Charleroi airport is unrivaled elsewhere in
         Belgium and has been achieved as a result of Ryanair's massive
         investment in aircraft and international advertising to promote low fare
         flights to and from Brussels Charleroi. The recent ill-informed press
         speculation surrounding the current investigation into Promocy is
         completely false and we look forward to co-operating with the Belgian
         authorities on the basis of the following facts:
      + Brussels Charleroi has increased its traffic tenfold since 2001
       + BSCA has developed into a thriving and profitable international
         airport operator
       + Promocy was set up to promote this development of traffic at Brussels
         Charleroi and is funded entirely by Ryanair and airport revenues.
      + Promocy receives/has received no funding from the Walloon region.
       + Any payments made by Promocy to Ryanair are to fund advertising and
         promotional activity of routes from Brussels Charleroi
       + During its 2-yr investigation the EU raised no concerns over the
         funding of Promocy.
        "To celebrate these 5 new routes and the continued growth of Brussels
         Charleroi, Ryanair is giving away 1M FREE* seats on www.ryanair.com
         until midnight Monday".

for shareholders.
In the last 6 months, Northgate's Human Resources division signed more than 31
new name clients, Public Services division signed 42 new applications clients
and Managed Services signed 12 new name clients. Significant contract wins
include Abbey National (MS), the Criminal Justice Board, Ryanair (HR) and
Bradford Metropolitan District Council (PS).
We continue to see Northgate competing for, and winning, far broader contracts.
We are developing deeper and more long-term commercial relationships and we have
become the strategic partner of choice for many clients. The enlarged suite of
software products brings greater opportunities for delivering value to clients
and strengthening our relationship with them.
We have built a robust business that is the leader in growing markets, with
strong, embedded client relationships. Our focus now is to exploit the excellent
cross-selling opportunities within the Group in order to drive revenues and
deliver further value for clients, shareholders and employees.
Human Resources
Northgate Info Solns Interim Results -2-
Northgate's Human Resources division reported revenues up from GBP54.9 million to
GBP56.1 million in the first half of this year. Organic growth in the half was
4.3%. This growth was depressed by legacy contract attrition from acquisitions.
This is now coming to an end and we expect growth to accelerate in the second
half.
Driven by good growth in application licence sales, operating margins increased
from 23.3% to 25.2% in the half. Operating profit before share option costs was
GBP14.2 million (2004: GBP12.8 million).
The order book grew by 22% to GBP106.0 million. There were 31 new name wins in
software applications and payroll & HR outsourcing. Approximately 47% of these
were as a result of cross-selling. HR continues to benefit from the trend for
clients to agree longer contracts and to contract for a wider range of services.
We have also made major progress in addressing the contract attrition that was
being suffered in a couple of our acquisitions. As a result, we can expect the
excellent performance in new name wins to start to feed through to higher levels
of top line growth.
Northgate is the largest HR and payroll application supplier in the UK and the
third largest HR and software application supplier in Europe. Northgate HR can
simplify key business tasks and deliver value added benefits to clients,
enabling them to improve HR management and cut costs. Clients range from
Manchester United Football Club to Tesco.
HR's ResourceLink is a highly scaleable, flexible and web-enabled integrated
suite of HR, payroll and pension modules. In the period, for example, we were
delighted that West Berkshire Council decided to implement Northgate's
ResourceLink HR and payroll solution. The 9-year contract replaces Unipay and
Opendoor - former Rebus HR solutions, before Northgate acquired Rebus in 2004.
The contract will enable the Council to automate many current manual tasks,
reduce duplication, and provide improved management information, saving time and
increasing efficiency. ResourceLink will provide the Council with the
opportunity to develop and introduce an innovative approach to interfacing with
Northgate Info Solns Interim Results -2-
the local schools' current HR system.
We continue to develop international, multi-lingual and multi-jurisdictional
applications of ResourceLink, making it increasingly attractive for
international clients. This product's ability to drive international revenue has
been highlighted by recent multi-country contract wins with Ryanair and McAfee.
Our SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) focused business, Moorepay, has seen
improvements in customer win rates while customer retention remains high at 92%.
Overall, our SME business won 586 new payrolls in the half, taking the total to
over 7,000.
Public Services
Northgate's Public Services division has seen revenues more than double to GBP48.5
million in the first half of this year. Operating margins rose from 9.2% to
16.6%. Operating profit before amortisation of capitalised customer
relationships and option costs was GBP8.0 million (2004: GBP2.1 million).
Organic growth was 5.2% in the first half, while we concentrated on integration
of acquisitions. Growth will accelerate in the second half as this process comes
to an end.
The order book grew organically by 15% to GBP85.1 million (H1 2004 pro-forma:
GBP74.1 million). There were 42 new name wins.
The acquisition of Sx3 enhances Northgate with market leading applications in
citizen relationship management, revenues and benefits systems and housing
management systems, which are used by government, criminal justice and public
safety organisations along with housing associations on a local level and the
utilities on a local, regional and national level. Northgate works with
approximately 90% of all UK local authorities, and all its police forces.
Northgate is helping local authorities to transform the delivery of public
services with Front Office, our market leading and award winning citizen
relationship management system. Front Office continued to be a significant
growth driver, with 12 new clients won during the period, bringing the total
number of Front Office clients to 62 (H1 2004: 49) and is recognised as the
Northgate Info Solns Interim Results -2-
leader in the Local Authority market. Contract wins include: Wycombe District
Council, Ashfield District Council and Wealden District Council. The outlook for
Front Office remains extremely good.
Our Assert product, which addresses the market need for simplified benefits
assessment, is also progressing well with a total of 12 contracts. Contract wins
include South Hams District Council in Devon and Amber Valley Council. The
outlook for Assert is promising.
Northgate's Front Office and Assert solutions help front line staff deal with
queries effectively. The number of clients using these products in tandem is
growing. They include South Ribble Council, Maidstone, Ynys Mon and Erewash.
Elsewhere, Wandsworth Borough Council is working with Northgate to improve its
planning and building control services. Northgate has developed an Expert
Enquiry System, to provide staff and citizens with easier access to information
on planning permission and building regulations. This system allows members of
the public to access answers to questions such as, "Do I need planning
permission or building regulation consent?" quickly and easily - either online
or over the telephone.
In the utilities market, our geographical information management products have
continued to do well with both South Staffordshire Water and Southern Water
signed up as new clients.
In Public Safety, Northgate has also been selected to provide its location hub
technologies to support the 'e-fire' National Project, the fire and rescue
service portal sponsored by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. We are also
launching a pilot information management scheme for England's Criminal Justice
Boards, in a partnership with LogicaCMG.
Overseas, we have worked with Nokia, Motorola and Siemens to provide software
for local emergency services.
The combined strength, knowledge and experience of Northgate and Sx3 will help
the Group become a valued consultant and partner for our clients. We expect
these types of service revenues to grow significantly in the medium-term.
Northgate Info Solns Interim Results -2-
Managed Services
Revenue for H1 2005/6 was GBP58.0 million (H1 2004/5: GBP19.5 million).
Operating margin was reduced with the division seeing an increased proportion of
hardware reselling operations following the Sx3 acquisition in April. Operating
profit before amortisation of capitalised customer relationships and option
costs was GBP2.6 million in the first half (2004: GBP1.6 million).
The order book reduced by 22% to GBP164.1 million (H1 2004 pro-forma: GBP211.3
million), as no major contracts reached renewal in the period. There were 12 new
name wins including Abbey National and National Trust for Scotland.
The local government market continues to offer good opportunities for growth as
clients seek to deliver benefits identified in the Gershon report on public
sector efficiency. We aim to leverage our existing relationships to help drive
our outsourcing business and grow our Managed Services revenue.
As an example, Sheffield Homes has successfully completed a GBP1 million overhaul
of the IT infrastructure supporting its core housing system. The improved IT
infrastructure, provided by Northgate, has enabled staff to be more responsive
to tenant needs through increasing capacity and responsiveness for its 1,000 IT
users. The Sheffield Homes project reflects our commitment to providing
customer value in local government, helping authorities to improve the quality
and efficiency of services they provide to citizens. Large scale IT upgrades
can often be a long-winded and complicated process. Our innovative solution and
approach means that users are seeing the maximum benefit in the shortest space
of time.
In Education, the Building Schools for the Future programme continues to offer
Northgate considerable opportunities. In the first half Northgate made
significant progress into the GB market with the award of a contract for
delivering ICT services to the Academy of St Francis of Assisi in Liverpool,
worth GBP0.9 million. We are currently short listed on a further three
opportunities.
Northgate has also been awarded the contract to deliver a project aimed at
Northgate Info Solns Interim Results -2-
freeing up staff time and improving the service to students for 450 staff and
5,000 students at Epping Forest College. In a contract worth over GBP1 million,
Northgate will take full ownership of service delivery for the College's
technical helpdesk, moving support from reactive to pro-active by monitoring and
addressing problems before issues arise.
In the utilities market, our Geographical Information Systems and related
services continue to do well. We have supplied innovative solutions to most UK
utilities and several overseas ones. These include specialised tools to South

                     RYANAIR'S DUBLIN PILOTS EACH RECEIVE
                       OVER EUR60,000 SHARE OPTION WINDFALL
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Friday, 2nd December 2005)
confirmed that many of its Dublin pilots have received windfalls of over EUR60,000
each by selling their share options, which became exercisable from yesterday
(1st December). Based on today's share price of EUR7.50 the options have a value
of EUR190,000, yielding windfalls of over EUR60,000 for each participating pilot.
The share options form part of the collective 5 year pay, benefit and share
option scheme that the Dublin pilots negotiated directly with the airline in
November 2000 and are the ninth tranche of options which Ryanair's Dublin pilots
have enjoyed over each of the past nine years. The total value of these options
to each qualifying Dublin pilot since Ryanair floated in 1997 is almost EUR500,000
and if disposed of at the exercise date, they have generated a total profit of
Ryanair Holdings PLC SHARE OPTION WINDFALL
almost EUR300,000 for each qualifying Dublin pilot.
Welcoming this latest tranche of profitable share options for Ryanair's pilots,
Ryanair's Director of Personnel, Eddie Wilson said:
    "Ryanair will continue to negotiate directly with all our people, and we
     hope that as a result of this internal collective bargaining process our
     people will continue to share in Ryanair's success as we grow to become
     Europe's largest and most valuable airline."
    "This latest EUR60,000 share option profit is one of many benefits which
     Ryanair's Dublin pilots have negotiated directly with Ryanair. Ryanair's
     pay, promotion, job security and share options are better than any other 737
     pilot package in Europe. This is why Ryanair has over the past 12 months
     recruited more than 150 pilots from other airlines including Easyjet,
     Lufthansa, SAS, Alitalia and British Midlands".

               RYANAIR CONFIRMED AS EUROPE'S NO.1 ON-TIME AIRLINE
                  & NO.1 FOR FEWEST CANCELLATIONS & LOST BAGGAGE
                     EXTENSION OF 2 MILLION FREE* SEATS SALE
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline was again today (Tuesday, 15th November
2005) confirmed as Europe's most punctual major scheduled carrier when compared
with the Association of European Airlines (AEA) customer service statistics for
the third quarter July - September 2005. Ryanair also has the fewest lost bags
and fewest flight cancellations of the major European carriers.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard, said:
        "Ryanair takes great pride in delivering excellent customer service and
         the lowest fares in Europe and we are delighted for this to be confirmed
         by the latest AEA customer service statistics, which puts Ryanair as
         Europe's No.1 major airline for on-time performance.
        "The AEA airlines, which include British Airways, Alitalia, Air France
         and Lufthansa, just can't beat Ryanair's low fares and they can't beat
         us for customer service either.
        "From July - September 2005, Ryanair lost 0.54 bags per thousand
         passengers while BA lost 20.4 bags. In the same period, almost 3 out of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair No. 1 On- Time Airline
         every 10 of BA's flights were delayed while only 1 in 10 of Ryanair's
         was delayed. With performance like this, it is no surprise that Ryanair
         will carry over 35 million passengers this year.
        "To celebrate, we are extending our 2 million free seats sale until
         midnight Thursday 17th November 2005, with seats available for purchase
         at www.ryanair.com".

     and 8,000 jobs this is the single biggest investment in German aviation by a
     non German company and will make Frankfurt Hahn one of the largest airports
     in Germany and Germany's fastest growing airport.
    "Ryanair will also provide a loan of EUR12.5 million in respect of 50% of the
     total capital expenditure on the new passenger terminal at Frankfurt Hahn
     and will also locate a Ryanair maintenance facility at the airport.
     "I wish to acknowledge the contribution of Fraport and the government of
     Rhineland Palatinate to this project. Ryanair's successful collaboration
     with these partners since 1999 has helped to transform the airport into a
     major stimulant for tourism and employment in the States economy. Today's
     announcement ensures that this growth will be taken a significant stage
     further. Over the next 7 years Ryanair looks forward to creating 8,000 jobs
     at Frankfurt Hahn, more than doubling passenger numbers and delivering the
     highest traffic growth and lowest fares in Germany".

07 November 2005
                  RYANAIR PROFITS RISE BY 18% TO RECORD EUR237M.
                     TRAFFIC GROWTH OF 29%, NET MARGIN OF 25%
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Monday, 7th November 2005)
announced record half year profits of EUR237m. Traffic grew by 29% to 18.0m
passengers, yields increased by 3% and as a result total revenues rose by 33% to
EUR946.2m. Unit costs increased by 8% (excluding fuel they fell by 7%) as fuel
costs rose by 108% to EUR236.9m. As a result of these significantly higher fuel
costs, Ryanair's adjusted after tax margin for the half year fell by 3 points to
25% as adjusted net profit increased by 18% to EUR237m.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results
Note 1:Adjusted profit after tax and EPS during the half year ended 30 September
2005 excludes a receipt, net of tax, of EUR5.2m arising from the settlement of an
insurance claim for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
"These record traffic and profits reflect the continued successful roll-out of
Ryanair's lowest fare model despite difficult trading conditions characterised
by record high fuel prices and intense competition. It also demonstrates the
robustness of the Ryanair model, which delivers significant profits and
passenger growth even during turbulent periods while many competitors are losing
money.
"As anticipated, yields were 3% higher than last year despite a 29% increase in
seat capacity. These slightly higher yields reflect the multiple fuel surcharges
imposed by European flag carriers, which have continued to widen the gap between
their high fares and Ryanair's lowest fares. We have again reaffirmed our
commitment not to impose fuel surcharges on our passengers and reaped the
benefits of this strategy in terms of significant traffic growth and slightly
higher yields during the half year. Ancillary revenues grew by 40% significantly
faster than the growth in passenger volumes and this year we expect that they
will continue to outpace passenger growth.
"Unit costs increased by 8% primarily due to higher fuel costs. Excluding fuel
all other unit costs were reduced by 7% thanks to the addition of more lower
cost and efficient Boeing 737-800's, new lower cost airport and base agreements
and continuing tight control over all other cost lines. We continue to focus
aggressively on costs and anticipate that the cost reductions achieved will
continue to partially offset the significantly higher oil prices.
"Our fuel costs rose by 108% to EUR237m as we were unhedged for almost the entire
half year. For the remainder of this fiscal year, to March 2006, we are 90%
hedged at rates equivalent to $49 per barrel. We are unhedged thereafter but
continue to closely monitor forward prices with a view to hedging our
requirements for summer of 2006. However, we expect that fuel prices will
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results
continue at these higher levels for some time.
"Our new routes and bases have performed well over the summer with Luton and
Liverpool performing strongly whilst yields at Shannon continue to be lower than
expected. We recently commenced operations at Pisa, our 13th European base, in
October with 10 routes, and announced our 14th base at Nottingham - East
Midlands which will open in March 2006 with two based aircraft and a total of 15
routes. We achieved a significant milestone during August by carrying more
passengers on our shorthaul European network than British Airways did on their
entire worldwide network in one month.
"During the half year, we exercised 14 Boeing 737-800 options for delivery in
2007, at which date we plan to sell on 5 older Boeing 737-800's delivered in
1999. This is a continuation of our strategy of operating the youngest fleet in
Europe with the lowest unit operating costs and delivering the best on time
performance. At our recent investor day conference Management highlighted that
we plan to double passenger volumes and profits by 2012 and believe that we are
still now in the early stages of low fare development in Europe. The exercise of
these net 9 options is part of our strategy to continue to increase seat
capacity to satisfy the growing demand for Ryanair's low fares.
"We continue to fight the levy of unjust taxes on our passengers and we welcome
the recent announcement by the UK government that it would not impose a GBP1 tax
on air tickets. This GBP1 tax was proposed by the CAA to cover their own failure
to ensure that scheduled airlines had adequate financial resources to fly to and
from the UK. We also oppose the GBP4bn BAA farce at Stansted Airport where the BAA
airport monopoly propose to build facilities that the users at the airport
unanimously oppose, as they are extravagant and over specified. The objective of
this inflated proposal is to ensure that the BAA airport monopoly can claim a
higher return on this GBP4bn of capital expenditure rather than the GBP400m to
GBP600m, which more accurately reflects the cost of the facilities that the user
airlines actually want them to build.
"In Ireland the recent decision by the Commission for Aviation Regulation to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results
allow Dublin Airport to increase airport charges by 23% from January next to pay
for a proposed 2nd terminal, 5 years before it is built and without any
consultation with the airline users (despite previous government assurances) is
beyond belief. We now have the bizarre situation that an over specified future
airport development is being funded by increasing charges now even though not a
sod has been turned on the facility, and there is no plan for it to be turned
for quite some time.
"We continue to remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal
year. We anticipate that the fare differentials between Ryanair and the flag
carriers will be partially eroded as the fuel surchargers are forced to lower
their underlying fares to compete with Ryanair's lower prices. We expect to
achieve significant increases in passenger's volumes but also anticipate that
yields in Q3 will be broadly in line with last year and Q4 yields will fall by a
range of -5% to -10%, as previously guided. Our full year net profit guidance is
unchanged. This winter we expect that there will be continued intense
competition and there will be fewer low fare carriers in the market as higher
fuel prices force more carriers out of the industry. Ryanair's combination of
the lowest fare in every market, our lowest cost base and industry leading
customer service will enable us to grow across Europe to the benefit of our
passengers, our people and our shareholders".

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
                                  Introduction
 For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
 adjusted income statement excluding exceptional items referred to below.
 Exceptional items for the half year ended September 30, 2005 consist of a
 receipt of EUR5.2m (net of tax) arising from the settlement of an insurance claim
 for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Profit after tax increased by 20% to EUR242.2m during the six months compared to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -3-
last year. The adjusted profit for the half year, excluding exceptional items,
increased by 18% to EUR237.0m.
The results for the period and comparative year have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standard ("IFRS") accounting policies
expected to be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year ended 31
March 2006, and a detailed explanation of the financial impact of the adoption
of these policies was set out in a separate document issued with the quarterly
financial results for the period to 30 June 2005.
Summary Half year ended Sept 30, 2005
Profit after tax increased by 18% to EUR237.0m, compared to EUR201.2m in the
previous half year ended September 30, 2004. These results were achieved by
strong growth in passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, excluding
fuel, which was significantly higher than in previous periods. Total operating
revenues increased by 33% to EUR946.2m, which is greater than the 29% growth in
passenger volumes, as average fares rose by 3% and ancillary revenues grew by
40% to EUR129.4m. Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 3% whilst
Passenger Load Factor decreased by 1 point to 86% during the period.
Total operating expenses increased by 40% to EUR664.0m, due to the increased level

by a lower amortisation charge due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the
positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of
737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the Euro to US$ also had a positive
impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge relating to new aircraft
deliveries.
Fuel costs rose by 105% to EUR127.0m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, an 8% increase in sector length, and a significantly higher average US$
cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the positive impact of the
strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the period.
Maintenance costs increased by 4% to EUR11.2m reflecting the improved reliability
arising from the higher proportion of 737-800 operated and a lower level of
maintenance costs incurred due to the return of six 737-300's and the positive
impact of the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate, partially offset by an
increase in the number of leased 737-800 aircraft from 10 to 17.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 3% to EUR3.4m due to the reduction
in the level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
previous year.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 31% to EUR10.7m reflecting an additional 7
aircraft on lease during the quarter offset by the savings arising from the
return of 6 737-300's to ILFC.
Route charges increased by 23% to EUR42.6m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown and an increase of 8% in the average sector length, offset by a
reduction in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 20% to EUR55.5m, which was slower than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports offset by lower costs and new airports and bases, and
the strengthening of the Euro exchange rate against Sterling.
Other expenses increased by 17% to EUR21.5m, which is lower than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some existing products, and cost
reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 5 points to 37% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 18% to EUR202.2m during the
quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR2.4m to EUR9.2m for the quarter due to the
combined impact of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in
average deposit rates earned in the quarter compared to last year.
Interest payable increased by EUR5.1m to EUR18.4m due to the drawdown of debt to
part fund the purchase of new aircraft.
Foreign exchange losses have decreased during the quarter to EUR0.5m due to the
positive impact of changes in the Sterling exchange rate against the Euro
compared to last year.
                       Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
    This period's financial information has been prepared on the basis of the
     recognition and measurement requirements of International Financial
     Reporting Standards ("IFRS") in issue that either are adopted by the EU and
     effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006 or are expected
     to be adopted and effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March
     2006, the Group's first annual reporting date at which it is required to use
     accounting standards adopted by the EU. Based on these recognition and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
     measurement requirements, management has made assumptions about the
     accounting policies expected to be applied, when the first annual financial
     statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards adopted by
     the EU for the financial year ending 31 March 2006. These preliminary
     accounting policies are set out in the document titled "Explanation of the
     financial impact following adoption of IFRS" published in August 2005 with
     the first quarter financial results.
 2. Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
     The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     half year ended Sept 30, 2005 on November 4th, 2005.
 3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
     The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the half year ended
     Sept 30, 2005 and the comparative period are based on the results reported
     under the group's preliminary IFRS accounting policies, as adjusted for
     certain exceptional items.
4. Ancillary Products and Services
        In order to more accurately reflect the structure of certain ancillary
         contracts and to provide more meaningful information to users the Group
         has taken the opportunity to reclassify certain ancillary revenues and
         costs (primarily car hire and travel insurance). This has resulted in a
         reduction in revenues of EUR19.9 million with a corresponding reduction in
         costs in the period ended 30 September 2005 (30 September 2004: EUR10.8
         million). This has resulted in an increase in net margin of 0.5% to
         25.1% in the period ended 30 September 2005 (30 September 2004 0.4% to
         28.3%). Going forward the Group intends to report ancillary revenues and
         costs on a basis consistent with the treatment described herein."
Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc for the six months ended 30
September 2005
Introduction
We have been instructed by the company to review the consolidated balance sheet
of Ryanair Holdings plc at 30 September 2005 and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' funds - equity and cash flows for
the six month period then ended and the related notes as set out on pages 1 to
7. We have read the other information contained in the interim report and
considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the financial information.
Directors' responsibilities
The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is
the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors
are responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Listing
Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange which require that the accounting policies and
presentation applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
applied in preparing the preceding annual accounts except where there are any
changes, and the reasons for them, are disclosed. As explained in note 3 to the
document published by Ryanair on 2nd August 2005, entitled "Explanation of the
Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards", EU law requires that the next annual consolidated financial
statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting standards
adopted for use in the European Union further to IAS Regulation (EC 1606/2002).
Therefore this interim financial information has been prepared on the basis of
the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS's in issue that either are
adopted by the EU and effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March
2006 or are expected to be adopted and effective (or available for early
adoption) at 31 March 2006.
Review work performed
We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/4
"Review of Interim Financial Information" issued by the Auditing Practices Board
for use in Ireland and the United Kingdom. A review consists principally of
making enquiries of group management and applying analytical procedures to the
financial information and underlying financial data and, based thereon,
assessing whether the accounting policies and presentation have been
consistently applied unless otherwise disclosed. A review excludes audit
procedures such as tests of controls and verification of assets, liabilities and
transactions. It is substantially less in scope than an audit performed in
accordance with Auditing Standards and therefore provides a lower level of
assurance than an audit. Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the
financial information.
Emphasis of matter
Without qualifying our review conclusion, we draw attention to note 3 to the
document published by Ryanair on 2nd August 2005, entitled "Explanation of the
Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards", that explains why there is a possibility that the company's
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -5-
management may determine that changes to the accounting policies adopted in
preparing the consolidated interim financial information are necessary when
management prepares its first annual financial statements in accordance with
accounting standards adopted by the EU as of 31 March 2006.
Review conclusion
On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial information as presented for the six months
ended 30 September 2005, which is stated to have been prepared in accordance
with the basis of preparation note set out in note 3 to the "Explanation of the
Financial Impact Following the Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards". This describes how the recognition and measurement requirements of
accounting standards expected to be adopted by the EU for use at the next annual
reporting date have been applied, including the assumptions management has made
about the standards and interpretations expected to be effective, and the
policies expected to be adopted, when management prepares its first annual
financial statements in accordance with accounting standards adopted by the EU
as of 31 March 2006.

of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges and airport
& handling costs associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, which
represents 36% of total operating costs compared to 24% last year, increased by
108% to EUR236.9m due to substantial increases in the US$ cost per gallon,
partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro to US$ exchange rate. Unit
costs excluding fuel declined by 7% as all other cost items increased at a
slower rate than the growth in passenger volumes. Due to the significantly
higher fuel costs operating margins declined by 3 points to 30%, whilst
operating profit increased by 20% to EUR282.1m.
Profit before tax has increased by 19%, less than the growth in operating profit
due to the higher net interest charges arising from the increased level of debt,
partially offset by foreign exchange gains which arose from the translation of
foreign currency bank balances to Euro at the half year end exchange rates.
Net Margins declined by 3 points to 25% for the reasons outlined above.
Adjusted basic earnings per share has risen by 17% to 31.00 cent for the period.
Balance Sheet
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -4-
The strong growth in profitability continues to positively impact the balance
sheet with Total Cash increasing by EUR200.6m to EUR1,806.3m despite funding an
additional EUR78.5m in capital expenditure from internal resources. The company
took delivery of one 737-800 aircraft and funded additional aircraft deposits
during the period. Total debt declined during the period as repayments exceeded
debt drawdowns by EUR43.3m. Shareholders' Funds at Sept 30, 2005 have increased by
EUR183.9m to EUR1,918.4m, compared to March 31, 2005 reflecting the EUR242.2m increase
in profitability during the period offset by a reduction of EUR69.2m resulting
from changes in the accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments,
pensions and stock options following the adoption of IFRS.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Half year ended Sept 30, 2005
Profit after tax, increased by 18% to EUR237.0m due to a 3% increase in average
fares, strong growth in ancillary revenues, and tight cost control which was
offset by fuel costs increasing by 108% to EUR236.9m during the period. Operating
margins, declined by 3% due to higher fuel costs whilst operating profit
increased by 20% to EUR282.1m compared to half year ended Sept 30, 2004.
Total operating revenues increased by 33% to EUR946.2m due to the combination of a
29% increase in passengers carried, an improvement in average fares and strong
growth in ancillary revenues.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 32% to EUR816.8m due to a 3% improvement
in average fares, increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful
launch of new routes and new bases at Shannon, Liverpool and Luton. The
strengthening of the euro against sterling during the period negatively impacted
fares by 1%. As expected Load factor also declined by 1 point to 86% during the
period.
Ancillary revenues continue to perform strongly with revenues growing by 40% to
EUR129.4m in the period. This performance reflects the strong growth in on board
sales, non-flight scheduled revenues, and other ancillary products. Ancillary
revenues continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and now
account for 14% of total revenues compared to 13% last year.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -4-
Total operating expenses increased by 40% to EUR664.0m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route
charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of the
airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by a 10% increase in
the average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partly offset by
the strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US dollar.
Staff costs have increased by 21% to EUR83.6m. This increase primarily reflects a
14% increase in average employee numbers to 2,987 and the impact of pay
increases of 3% granted during the period. Pilots, who earn higher than the
average salary, accounted for 44% of the increase in employment during the
period.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 18% to EUR53.0m. There are an
additional eight 'owned' 737-800 aircraft in the fleet this year compared to
last year. The resultant higher depreciation charge was offset by a combination
of lower amortisation due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the positive
impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of 737-800
aircraft. The strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a positive impact on the
depreciation and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 108% to EUR236.9m due to a 32% increase in the number of hours
flown, a significant increase in the average US$ cost per gallon of fuel
partially offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the
US dollar during the period.
Maintenance costs increased by EUR0.2m to EUR25.1m reflecting an increase in the
size of the fleet operated, and an increase in the number of hours flown offset
by maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from the higher
proportion of 737-800 operated and the return of 6 leased 737-300's to ILFC.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by EUR2.0m to EUR8.7m due to the
reduction in the level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to
the previous year.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 28% to EUR20.7m reflecting an additional 7
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -4-
aircraft on lease during the period partially offset by the savings arising from
the return of 6 737-300 aircraft to ILFC.
Route charges increased by 24% to EUR83.9m due to an increase in the number
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length, offset by a reduction
in enroute charges in certain EU countries and the benefit of a stronger euro to
sterling exchange rate.
Airport and handling charges increased by 22% to EUR110.0m, which is lower than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports and bases, and
the positive impact of the strength of the euro exchange rate against sterling
during the period.
Other expenses increased by 14% to EUR42.0m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on certain indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 3 points to 30% for the period due to the
reasons outlined above which has resulted in operating profits increasing by 20%
to EUR282.1m.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR5.0m to EUR17.8m due to the combined impact
of a higher cash balance and increases in average deposit rates during the
period.
Interest payable increased by EUR10.9m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund
the purchase of new aircraft during the period.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in
profits during the period. The Company generated cash from operating activities
of EUR311.5m. which part funded capital expenditure during the period with the
balance reflected in Total Cash of EUR1,806.3m. Capital expenditure of EUR78.5m
primarily comprised of the delivery of an aircraft and further advance payments
for future aircraft deliveries. Long term Debt, net of repayments decreased by
EUR43.3m during the period.
Shareholders' Funds at September 30, 2005 have increased by EUR183.9m to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -4-
EUR1,918.4m, compared to March 31, 2005 reflecting the EUR242.2m increase in
profitability during the period offset by a reduction of EUR69.2m resulting from
changes in the accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments,
pensions and stock options following the adoption of IFRS.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended September 30, 2005
Profit after tax, increased by 16% to EUR172.5m due to a 3% increase in average
fares and strong ancillary revenue growth, which was offset by fuel costs which
increased by 105% to EUR127.0m reflecting the higher US$ cost per gallon.
Operating margins, as a result, fell by 5 points to 37%, which in turn resulted
in operating profit increasing by 18% to EUR202.2m compared to the previous
quarter.
Total operating revenues increased by 32% to EUR541.5m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 28% to 9.5m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 3% in the
quarter due to a combination of higher average fares, strong ancillary revenue
growth but was partially offset by the weakening of Sterling exchange rate
against the Euro.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 31% to EUR470.5m due to a combination of
increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Luton, Liverpool and Shannon and a 3% increase in average fares,
partially offset by the weakening of Sterling exchange rate against the Euro.
Ancillary revenues increased 36% to EUR71.0m, a faster growth rate than passenger
volumes, reflecting a strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues,
on-board sales and other ancillary products. Ancillary revenues continue to grow
at a faster rate than passenger volumes and remain at 13% of total revenues
compared to the same period last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 41% to EUR339.3m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route
charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of the
airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by an increase in
the average sector length, whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partially offset
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half Year Financial Results -4-
by the strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US$.
Staff costs have increased by 18% to EUR41.5m primarily due to a 14% increase in
average employee numbers to 2,876 and the impact of pay increases of 3% compared
to the previous quarter ended September 30, 2004.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 22% to EUR26.1m. A higher depreciation
charge due to an increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from 66 to 74, offset

                       RYANAIR DUBLIN PILOTS EACH RECEIVE
                          EUR50,000 SHARE OPTION WINDFALL
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline, today (Friday, 4th November 2005)
confirmed that many of its Dublin pilots will, next month (1 Dec), exercise
share options which at the current share price (over EUR7) have a profit of
approx. EUR50,000 each. These share options (which formed part of the 5 year pay,
benefit and share option scheme collectively negotiated directly between the
Dublin pilots and the airline in November 2000) fall due to be exercised at the
end of November. The total value of the shares held by each qualifying pilot
under the scheme are presently valued at over EUR175,000. If any pilot were to
exercise and dispose of their options at this week's price of EUR7 he/she would
make a profit of just over EUR50,000 on these options.
These latest share options are the ninth tranche of options which Ryanair's
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Pilot Share Options
Dublin pilots have enjoyed over each of the past nine years. The total value of
these options to each qualifying Dublin pilot since Ryanair floated in 1997 is
almost EUR500,000 and if disposed of at the exercise date, they have generated a
total profit of almost EUR300,000 for each qualifying Dublin pilot.
Welcoming this latest tranche of profitable share options for Ryanair's pilots,
Ryanair's Director of Personnel, Eddie Wilson said:
    "This ninth round of share options is the latest in a long line of share
     options and other benefits which Ryanair's pilots have successfully
     negotiated directly with the airline in recent years. Since Ryanair floated
     in 1997, a Ryanair Captain in Dublin has seen
   his/her annual earnings rise to over EUR120,000 per annum,
    his/her transfer to flying brand new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft,
    he/she enjoys a fixed roster which guarantees 5 days off in every 15
     days,
    he/she enjoys a legal limit of 900 flying hours per annum, which equates
     to 18 flight hours per week,
    share options, which thus far have yielded profits of almost EUR300,000 per
     qualifying pilot.
    "This EUR50,000 share option profit is just the latest benefit which Ryanair's
     Dublin pilots have negotiated directly (through collective bargaining) with
     the airline. Ryanair's pay, promotion, job security and share options are
     better than any other similar 737 pilot package in Europe. This is why
     Ryanair has over the past 12 months recruited more than 150 pilots from
     other airlines including Easyjet, Lufthansa, SAS, Alitalia, Aer Lingus and
     British Midlands. Ryanair will continue to negotiate directly with all our
     pilots, and we hope that as a result of this internal collective bargaining
     process they will continue to share in Ryanair's success as we continue to
     grow to become Europe's largest and most valuable airline".

             RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW DAILY ROUTE FROM DUBLIN TO RIGA
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Thursday, 3rd November 2005)
announced a new route from Dublin to Riga (Latvia) that will operate daily from
the 9th January 2006.
Announcing the news in Dublin today, Michael Cawley, Ryanair's Deputy CEO said:
        "We are delighted to start our first route between Ireland and Eastern
         Europe with a daily flight to Riga commencing in January 2006. In the
         first year of operations, 80,000 passengers will enjoy our low fares
         between Dublin and the Latvian capital for a fraction of the high prices
         being charged by Aer Lingus and Air Baltic.
        "Ryanair began operating flights to and from Riga at the end of 2004 and
         now offers daily routes from Riga to 6 European cities. Riga's 800 year
         history has made it a hugely popular destination for tourists around
         Europe and the leisure market from Ireland to Riga will be transformed
         because Ryanair's low fares will make it an affordable city break
         destination for the first time.
        "The considerable Latvian population in Ireland will also benefit from
         our low fares allowing them to travel more often between the two
         countries courtesy of Europe's lowest fares and save a fortune in the
         process.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Daily Route Dublin to Riga
        "This new route goes on sale today on www.ryanair.com with widely
         available fares from only EUR9.99* and we are advising passengers to book
         now as demand for fares this low to Riga will be very strong".

        "Ryanair's superior punctuality record which is verified by the CAA
         shows that not alone will our passengers fly for 50% less than Easyjet's
         high fares, but they will also be much more likely to arrive on time if
         they fly with Ryanair.
        "To celebrate stuffing Easy-"To-Be-Late"-Jet 3 years in a row we are
         launching a 2 M FREE* Seat Sale all over Europe on www.ryanair.com from

BAA REPORTS GOOD RESULTS DESPITE SUMMER PROBLEMS
              BAA RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2005
Underlying first half performance1:
  * Passenger traffic (including Naples Airport) up 2.5% to 82.3 million (30
     September 2004: 80.3 million)
* Revenue up 6.4% to GBP1,173 million (GBP1,102 million)
* Operating profit up 9.6% to GBP412 million (GBP376 million)
  * UK airports' net retail income grew 3.8% to GBP324 million (GBP312 million) and
     per passenger rose 1.2% to GBP4.08 (GBP4.03)
Statutory results:
* Revenue of GBP1,173 million (GBP1,128 million)
  * Operating profit of GBP441 million (GBP644 million); excluding certain
     re-measurements2, operating profit of GBP405 million (GBP395 million)
  * Profit before tax of GBP367 million (GBP597 million); excluding certain
     re-measurements2, profit before tax of GBP366 million (GBP348 million)
  * Earnings per share of 24.0 pence (39.3 pence); excluding certain
     re-measurements2, earnings per share of 23.9 pence (22.9 pence)
Other highlights:
* Interim dividend up 5.1% to 7.25pence (6.9 pence)
  * Delivering Excellence, BAA's reorganisation programme to align the
BAA PLC Interim Results
     organisation to an airport-led operating model, by driving improved
     customer service and operational efficiency, will contribute GBP45 million
     per annum sustained benefits from 2008/09 incurring GBP90 million of
     exceptional operating costs. Changes focussed on back office and management
     will result in around 700 fewer jobs.
1. Underlying performance reflects: the pro forma adjustment in 2004/05 for the
impact of the Airport Property Partnership (APP) transaction (GBP19 million
reduction in both revenue and operating profit); exclusion of the additional
income and provision (GBP7 million respectively) in 2004/05 linked to the Ryanair
litigation; exclusion in 2005/06 of GBP7 million exceptional costs relating to
the Delivering Excellence change programme; and exclusion of certain
re-measurements (see Note 2 below).
2.Certain re-measurements consist of fair value gains and losses on investment
property revaluations and disposals and the gains and losses arising on the
re-measurement and disposal of derivative financial instruments, together with
the associated fair value gains and losses on any underlying hedged items that
are part of a fair value hedging relationship, together with the related tax
impact of these items.
Mike Clasper, BAA's Chief Executive Officer of BAA, commented:
"Our clear strategic focus, supported by skilful innovation, has once again
demonstrated its value in today's results. We have turned a traffic increase of
2.5% into an underlying 6.4% increase in revenue and a 9.6% rise in operating
profit. We have delivered this performance despite a slowing UK economy and the
impact of this summer's London bombings and the Gate Gourmet dispute. These
results demonstrate the strength of our business, our assets and our
management.
"We remain confident of delivering a good retail performance, maintaining tight
control of costs and, as announced on 20 September 2005, we anticipate around
3% traffic growth for our UK airports this year.
"Delivering Excellence will improve customer service and shorten decision
chains, leading to more effective management and sustained efficiencies of GBP45
million per annum from 2008/09. Supported by further innovation, it will
BAA PLC Interim Results
deliver continued improvement in our business performance."
  * A presentation and live webcast of BAA's results for analysts and
     institutional investors will take place at 9.30am today at Bloomberg, City
     Gate House, 39-45 Finsbury Square, London EC2A 1PQ.
  * An archived webcast, including speeches and the question and answer
     session, of this morning's presentation is available from this afternoon on
     BAA's website - www.baa.com/investor.
  * A pre-recorded interview with BAA's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Clasper,
     is available from 7.30am today on BAA's website - www.baa.com/investor.

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
For the first time, BAA's results are presented on an IFRS basis with
comparatives, previously reported under UK GAAP, restated accordingly. The
format of the income statement separately identifies the following items within
the fair value gains and losses (`certain re-measurements') column:
  * Fair value gains and losses on investment property revaluations and
     disposals;
  * The gains and losses arising on the re-measurement and disposal of
     derivative financial instruments, together with associated fair value gains
     and losses on any underlying hedged items that are part of a fair value
     hedging relationship; and
* The associated tax impact of the above items.
Where possible, BAA has applied hedge accounting to interest rate derivatives.
Due to the strict definitions surrounding hedge accounting within IAS 39
`Financial Instruments', where a derivative transaction is viable from an
economic and commercial perspective it may not meet the hedge accounting
criteria laid down under IAS 39. This is the case in respect of BAA's portfolio
of forward starting interest rate swaps, which are being used to manage the
exposure to interest rate movements prior to the issuance of the related debt.
As announced in our pre-close trading update on 20 September 2005, BAA is
revaluing its investment property portfolio at 30 September 2005 and 31 March
2006.
The results before these fair value gains and losses are separately presented,
as this basis of presentation provides more helpful information about the
BAA PLC Interim Results
underlying performance of BAA's business.

2 Defined as revenues received directly from third party retail operators,
concession fee paid to UK airports by World Duty Free (WDF) and WDF's operating
profit - see Note 14.
3 Defined as net retail income divided by number of passengers (excluding
helicopter passengers) - see Note 14.
The statutory results for both the current and prior year were affected by four
items:
(i) In the current period, revenue and operating profit were negatively
impacted by GBP19 million respectively as a result of the property joint venture
(Airport Property Partnership - `APP') entered into with Morley Fund Management
in March 2005;
(ii) During the period to 30 September 2004 BAA and Ryanair were actively
pursuing litigation against each other. As a consequence, BAA had invoiced
Ryanair for GBP7 million additional airport charges but a provision for the same
amount had also been set up. The matter was resolved by 31 March 2005 and the
income and provision subsequently credited and released;
BAA PLC Interim Results
(iii) For the six months to 30 September 2005, GBP7 million of exceptional costs
were incurred relating to the Delivering Excellence change programme; and
(iv) The inclusion of `certain re-measurements' relating to the fair value
gains and losses on investment property revaluations and disposals (gain GBP35
million on Group investment properties and GBP14 million share of revaluation
gain on APP investment properties, within associates and joint ventures; 2004:
gain GBP244 million on Group investment properties), and the gains and losses
arising on the re-measurement and disposal of derivative financial instruments,
together with the associated fair value gains and losses on any underlying
hedged items that are part of a fair value hedging relationship (loss GBP48
million - GBP1 million gain within other operating income and GBP49 million loss
within finance costs; 2004: gain GBP5 million - within other operating income),
together with the related tax impact of these items.
Management considers that reporting revenue and operating profit before the
items listed above reflects the underlying performance of BAA's business. As
such, underlying revenue and operating profit have been determined by adjusting
for these items.

3 Due to rounding distortions within small amounts, these percentages have been
calculated on actual numbers, not rounded GBP million.
Traffic
In the six months to 30 September 2005, passenger traffic increased 2.5% to
BAA PLC Interim Results -2-
82.3 million passengers. The long-haul market was a significant contributor to
this traffic growth. New routes across the North Atlantic and to Asia from
Gatwick, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Naples all contributed to this strong
performance.
In the European short-haul market, scheduled services continued to grow at the
expense of the charter market. The impact of this switch was particularly
evident at Gatwick, Glasgow and Naples airports.
Southampton and Scotland experienced strong domestic growth, following the
introduction of new routes and services, but, at the three London airports,
domestic passenger traffic declined following a difficult summer and a weaker
UK economy.
At Heathrow, it is anticipated that traffic growth will continue to be limited,
over the next few years, by capacity constraints and the slow transition of
slots from short-haul operations to more attractive long-haul. The pace of slot
usage change to long-haul at Heathrow is slowed by the highly regulated nature
of international aviation.
Revenue
Underlying revenue increased 6.4% to GBP1,173 million (GBP1,102 million),
reflecting the 2.5% increase in terminal passengers, rise in aeronautical
tariffs and good retail performance. Aeronautical income was up 10.0% to GBP497
million (GBP452 million), driven by the 2.5% growth in passengers and, in
particular, tariff increases at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Average
aeronautical income per passenger rose 6.9% to GBP6.02 (GBP5.63).
Airport retailing performance remained strong, despite the adverse external
conditions during the period and increased competition from off-airport car
parks at Heathrow and Gatwick. UK airports' net retail income grew 3.8% to GBP324
million (GBP312 million) and net retail income per passenger rose 1.2% to GBP4.08
(GBP4.03).
Operating costs
The Group's underlying operating costs grew 4.8% to GBP761 million (GBP726
BAA PLC Interim Results -2-
million). The GBP35 million increase primarily reflected rent, rates and
utilities rising GBP15 million (17.0%). Staff costs were up GBP9 million (3.5%),
with wage inflation and pension cost increases being partially offset by a
modest improvement in productivity. In addition, maintenance and depreciation
increased GBP5 million and GBP6 million respectively.
Operating profit
Underlying operating profit grew 9.6% to GBP412 million (GBP376 million).
Regulated airports
Heathrow
  * Strong growth in revenue of 8.2% to GBP552 million (GBP510 million) led to
     Heathrow's operating profit increasing 13.1% to GBP233 million (GBP206
     million);
  * Passenger numbers remained flat at 35.8 million, reflecting the impact of
     the London bombings and the Gate Gourmet dispute during the busy summer
     months and the slow transition of slots from short-haul usage to attractive
     long-haul;
  * Aeronautical charges income grew 11.3% to GBP285 million (GBP256 million)
     following price increases in April, in line with the regulatory cap.
     Aeronautical income per passenger rose GBP0.79 (11.1%) to GBP7.94;
  * Net retail income grew 3.4% to GBP120 million (GBP116 million), despite no
     growth in passenger traffic, with the new international departure lounge at
     Terminal 1 contributing to this increase;
* Rail income rose 5.9% to GBP36 million (GBP34 million); and
  * Operating costs increased 4.9% to GBP319 million (GBP304 million), the primary
     factor being a GBP9 million increase in utilities, rent and rates.
Gatwick
  * Revenue grew 5.7% to GBP186 million (GBP176 million) but operating profit was
     flat at GBP74 million;
  * Traffic was up 2.9% to 19.1 million, driven by the significant growth of
     Easyjet and other no frills carriers, offset by the continued decline of
     the charter airlines;
  * Aeronautical charges income rose 7.0% to GBP92 million (GBP86 million) and per
     passenger it was up GBP0.20 (4.3%) to GBP4.80;
  * Net retail income grew 1.6%, despite the decline in car parking income due
     to intense competition from off-airport competitors; and
  * Operating costs rose 9.8% to GBP112 million (GBP102 million). New facilities
     coming into operation, including Pier 6, the refurbished Piers 2 and 3 and
     the new arrivals extension at North Terminal, contributed an additional GBP2
     million of depreciation. In addition, the rise in utility costs and
     business rates contributed a further GBP4 million.
Stansted
  * Revenue increased 8.4% to GBP90 million (GBP83 million), with a 3.4% rise in
     operating profit to GBP30 million (GBP29 million);
BAA PLC Interim Results -2-
  * Traffic increased 6.3%, primarily as a result of the continued growth in
     demand for no frills services;
  * Aeronautical charges income grew 17.1% to GBP41 million (GBP35 million) and per
     passenger was up GBP0.25 (8.1%) to GBP3.32, as the discount arrangements
     provided to airlines at Stansted continue to unwind;
  * Net retail income grew strongly during the period, up 8.3% to GBP39 million
     (GBP36 million); and
  * Operating costs increased 11.1% to GBP60 million (GBP54 million). This stepped
     increase of GBP6 million was primarily due to higher utility costs and
     business rates. In addition, staff costs rose GBP2 million, reflecting both
     an increase in the number of security staff, due to continued strong
     traffic growth, and general wage inflation.
Scottish airports
  * Total revenue and operating profit for the three Scottish airports grew
     6.5% and 7.3% to GBP99 million (GBP93 million) and GBP44 million (GBP41 million)
     respectively;
  * Traffic increased 5.5% to 11.4 million passengers with good growth recorded
     at all airports. Traffic grew 2.8% and 7.5% at Glasgow and Edinburgh
     respectively and Aberdeen passenger traffic grew 8.6% in the period as new
     routes were introduced and those developed in the prior year continued to
     develop;
  * The rise in passenger numbers resulted in a 3.3% rise in aeronautical
     charges income to GBP62 million (GBP60 million), despite a GBP0.09 (1.6%) decline
     in yield to GBP5.44;
  * Strong growth in net retail income was also achieved across the three
     airports, up 14.3% to GBP24 million (GBP21 million); and
* Operating costs rose 5.8% to GBP55 million (GBP52 million).
Other airports
* Operating profit increased 25% to GBP10 million (GBP8 million) on a revenue

                 RYANAIR WELCOMES LUTON AIRPORT EXPANSION PLANS
Ryanair, Europe's largest International Airline, today (Friday, 28th October
2005) welcomed the announcement by Luton Airport of its plans to develop a
second runway and two additional terminals to allow the airport to triple
passenger numbers to 30 million a year by 2020. Ryanair supports the development
of low cost airport facilities in the south east, and will work closely with
Luton International Airport to help it achieve these exciting plans for growing
passenger numbers, jobs and investment in the Luton and Bedfordshire region.
Ryanair said that the Luton plans highlighted yet again the exorbitant waste by
the BAA airport monopoly at Stansted where similar facilities are being planned
but at a cost of GBP4 billion, more than double the Luton budget. Ryanair has
always supported a low cost second runway at Stansted, but opposes (with the
support of all other Stansted Airport users) the profligate waste on over
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcome of LutonAirport Plans
specified facilities proposed by the BAA monopoly as it tries to maximize
capital expenditure in order to jack up charges to the airlines and to
passengers for the next 20 years. Ryanair has consistently campaigned for a low
cost second runway and second terminal at Stansted to mirror the low cost nature
of the passenger traffic using Stansted Airport.
Welcoming this week's development plans by Luton Airport, Ryanair's Chief
Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
   "This week's developments at Luton highlight again the benefit of
     airport competition in the south east. The fact that a privately owned
     company can deliver a second runway and two additional terminals at a
     cost of GBP1.5 billion proves yet again that the airline users at Stansted
     are correct in their unanimous opposition to the profligate waste by the
     BAA who are budgeting to spend GBP4 billion building similar facilities at
     Stansted.
    "The problem with BAA airports in the London region is that they operate
      as an effective monopoly where the regulator (the CAA) has long failed
      to provide effective regulation in the reasonable interest of users. The
      fact that the BAA at Stansted plans to spend 4 times what is necessary
      for the development of a second runway and second terminal, and yet is
      looking to the regulator to start increasing charges to the airlines and
      the passengers some five years before these facilities are put in place
      highlights the urgent need for the break up of the BAA airport monopoly.
    "Ryanair believes that air transport in the south east would benefit
      from the freeing up of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted to compete against
      each other, as this would lead to the development of efficient low cost
      facilities and a low cost airport environment to promote low fare air
      travel to and from London and the south east. What we have at the moment
      is a high cost airport monopoly in Stansted and an ineffective regulator
      allowing it to develop over specified and over priced Taj Mahals".

          Ryanair Exercises 9 Further Boeing 737-800 Options
           - Increases Fleet including Firm Options to 234
Ryanair Holdings plc today (Tuesday, 4th October 2005) held an Investor Day in
London. At this meeting the airline updated investors on current trading and
also confirmed the exercise of 9 further Boeing 737-800 options for delivery in
2007 along with the planned sale (in 2007) of 5 Boeing 737-800's purchased in
1999.
Speaking in London, Michael O'Leary, Chief Executive Officer said:
        "Current trading continues to be in line with expectations. Higher fuel
         prices over the summer months have been partly offset by a combination
         of other cost reductions and slightly more benign yield environment.
         Passenger volumes and load factors have been strong over the summer and
         in August we achieved a significant milestone by carrying more
         passengers on our short haul European network than British Airways (now
         just the worlds 2nd favourite airline) did on their entire worldwide
         network.
        "Looking forward to the winter we remain cautious. We expect yields to
         benefit from the multiple fuel surcharges imposed by the high fare
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Trading Update
         carriers across Europe. However, we anticipate that the fare
         differential between Ryanair and the flag carriers will be partially
         eroded as the fuel surchargers are forced to lower their underlying
         fares to compete with Ryanair's lower prices. We therefore remain
         cautious but comfortable with our previous guidance for the remainder of
         this fiscal year as we anticipate strong load factors and passenger
         volumes but as expected, at slightly lower yields.
        "The recent announcement of the cessation of the Boeing strike will in
         turn enable our aircraft deliveries to be "back on track" by the end of
         December 2005. We anticipate there will be no material adverse impact on
         the company's financial performance or passengers carried arising from
         the strike.
        "I am also pleased to announce that we have exercised options to
         purchase 9 Boeing 737-800's with a value of over $500m dollars for
         delivery in late 2007, (3 in September, 2 in October and 4 in November).
         We also plan in late 2007 to sell on the first 5 of our older Boeing
         737-800's, which were delivered in 1999. This is a continuation of
         Ryanair's strategy of operating the youngest fleet in Europe, with the
         lowest unit operating costs and best technical reliability, thereby
         ensuring that Ryanair remains the number 1 on-time major airline in
         Europe. These 4 incremental option aircraft will in turn enable Ryanair
         to develop even more new routes while we continue to lead the low fare
         revolution across Europe".
The company currently operates a fleet of 83 Boeing 737-800's and 9 Boeings
737-200's. The exercise of these 9 options and the planned sale during late 2007
of the 5 aircraft acquired in 1999, combined with the existing firm Boeing
commitments will in turn lead to Ryanair's fleet increasing by 151 aircraft to
234 aircraft by 2012. In addition the company has options over a further 179
aircraft for delivery between 2008 and 2014.

 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES MINOR FLIGHT CHANGES TO ACCOMMODATE AIRCRAFT DELIVERY DELAYS
                           BECAUSE OF THE BOEING STRIKE
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today announced a series of minor
modifications to its flight schedule during the months of September and October
arising from delays in the delivery of seven aircraft which were scheduled to be
received in September and October, but are now not expected to be delivered
until November and December.
Boeing, Ryanair's aircraft supplier have experienced work stoppages since early
September. Ryanair is now assuming that these disruptions will continue until at
least the end of October. There is every possibility that the dispute at Boeing
may be resolved earlier than this date, however Ryanair is keen to give
passengers the maximum degree of notice, and has therefore taken the following
steps with regard to its September/October flight programme:
 1. Three of the 737-200 series aircraft which were due to be retired in
Ryanair Holdings PLC MINOR FLIGHT CHANGES
     September will continue in service until the end of October.
 2. The new base launches in Liverpool and Pisa, both of which are scheduled to
     commence on 27th September and 10th October will proceed as normal with
     Ryanair using a new 737-800 which was delivered by Boeing in early
     September, and also using one of the three spare 800's for the month of
     October.
 3. Approximately 200 flights (representing less than 1%) have been amalgamated
     during the month of October. Ryanair expects that the financial impact of
     the amalgamations will be immaterial in both the third quarter and in the
     full year results.
Ryanair will continue to liaise closely with Boeing as the dispute evolves
through the remainder of September and into October. If there is a likelihood of
the dispute continuing into November, Ryanair will make an early decision and
ensure that all passengers are notified of any schedule changes during the first
week of October if at that time it is expected that the impact will continue
into November.
As always Ryanair's primary objective is to provide our customers with as much
advance notice as possible of these minor schedule alterations, whilst at the
same time fully supporting our partners Boeing as they work with their people to
resolve the current dispute and resume delivering the world's best aircraft to
the world's favourite international airline.
Ends.                   Tuesday, 20th September 2005.

          RYANAIR POSTPONES PLANS FOR BASE AT HAMBURG LUEBECK AIRPORT
                   AFTER COURT RULES AGAINST PLANNING APPROVAL
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday 13th September 2005)
announced that it has postponed plans to launch a base at Hamburg Luebeck
airport, which would have delivered up to 2 million passengers per annum and
created 2,000 jobs in the Schleswig-Holstein region because the Higher
Administrative Court of Schleswig-Holstein ruled against planning approval to
extend the runway, expand the main taxiway and upgrade the instrument landing
system.
Ryanair's planned expansion at Hamburg Luebeck was subject to this approval
being granted and these works being completed. Consequently, Ryanair has been
forced to postpone its intended base at Hamburg Luebeck for the moment and will
announce a replacement later this week.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Postponment plans HamburgBase
Michael O'Leary, CEO of Ryanair said;
"The Administrative Court ruling against planning permission means that we now
have to postpone plans for a new base in Hamburg Luebeck. Although Hamburg
Luebeck will not benefit at this time from increased passenger numbers that
would have supported up to 2,000 new jobs in the region, Ryanair will maintain
its existing operation at the airport. Ryanair will also continue to support its
partners - the City of Luebeck and Infratil - in their efforts to resolve this
planning problem so that they can continue to develop the airport, grow their
passenger numbers, and we can proceed with the launch of a Ryanair base in
Hamburg Luebeck as soon as it is practical in the future."
"We will announce another base in Europe later this week, where we will invest
over $100M in new aircraft, new routes and new jobs".

             RYANAIR GUARANTEE: NO FUEL SURCHARGE NOT NOW, NOT EVER
                     BRITISH AIRWAYS ADDS 6th FUEL SURCHARGE
Ryanair, the World's Favourite Airline today (Friday, 9th September 2005)
advised passengers that if they want to avoid fuel surcharges they should travel
with Ryanair and avoid British Airways. British Airways have just added a 6th
successive fuel surcharge and they are now forcing passengers to pay surcharges
of up to GBP60 for a return trip on top of their already high fares. British
Airways' fuel surcharge on its own is more than twice Ryanair's average fare.
Passengers will neverpay a fuel surcharge with Ryanair.
Speaking this morning, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
    "Ryanair carried more passengers than British Airways' entire worldwide
     figure for the first time in the month of August and it is not hard to see
     why when British Airways is adding fuel surcharges of up to GBP60 for a return
     trip on top of their extortionately high fares.
    "Ryanair's guarantees no fuel surcharge, not now, not ever. Our 4M FREE*
     seat sale means that Ryanair passengers can get seats for free and never
Ryanair Holdings PLC Guaranteed No Fuel Surcharge
     have to worry about fuel surcharges. This is why Ryanair has become the
     World's Favourite Airline and British Airways, the fuel surchargers, will
     always be the second choice".

            IT'S OFFICIAL - RYANAIR IS THE WORLD'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE
                 AUGUST PASSENGER STATS BLOW BRITISH AIRWAYS AWAY
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Monday, 5th September 2005)
celebrated carrying more passengers in one month than British Airways on its
worldwide network for the first ever time. The statistics for August published
by both Ryanair and BA show that Ryanair carried 156,000 more passengers than
BA's entirenetwork figure. Ryanair currently operates 250 routes across 21
countries and this year will carry 35 million passengers.
Speaking this afternoon, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
        "It's official - RYANAIR has today become the WORLD'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE!
         Last month Ryanair's traffic exceeded BA's worldwidepassengers across
         its entire network. Ryanair carried over 3.26 million passengers an
         increase of 27% on the same period last year, while BA carried 3.10
         million passengers on its entire worldwide network, as sales slumped by
         4% from BA's August 2004 traffic in the face of multiple fuel
         surcharges. (BA suffered flight disruptions in August 2004 as well as
         2005)
Ryanair Holdings PLC WORLD'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE
        "Ryanair's passenger volumes are growing rapidly thanks to new
         destinations, lowest ever fares, industry leading punctuality and
         customer service and Ryanair's guarantee of NO fuel surcharges, not
         today, not tomorrow, not ever. BA keep turning passengers away with fuel
         surcharge after fuel surcharge, high fares, poor punctuality, flight
         cancellations and no catering. At least on Ryanair, customers can buy a
         sandwich with GBP100 they have saved over BA's high fares.
         "That is why RYANAIR is now the WORLD'S FAVOURITE AIRLINE, and BA are
         now officially just the second choice".

               RYANAIR CUTS 12 FLIGHTS PER WEEK AT NEWQUAY AFTER
                 CORNWALL COUNTY COUNCIL'S GBP5 'ANTI VISITOR' TAX
Ryanair Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 31st August 2005)
announced the withdrawal of 12 flights per week or 100,000 passengers per annum
at Newquay airport following the decision by Cornwall County Council to impose a
GBP5 surcharge on passengers and visitors to the region.
Speaking this morning, Michael Cawley, Deputy CEO of Ryanair, said:
        "Ryanair has always made it very clear to Cornwall County Council that
         their airport and region is part of a competitive price sensitive market
         that must compete with 84 other low fare destinations from London
         Stansted. Under the right conditions this market is capable of
         delivering huge economic benefits to the region and in excess of 200,000
         passengers per annum.
        "Cornwall County Council's ridiculous decision to introduce a GBP5 tax per
         departing passenger would result in increased revenue of GBP250,000 for
         the Council and a reduced income for the region of GBP10.5M leaving
         Cornwall worse off to the effect of GBP10M per annum in terms of
         expenditure by visitors brought by Ryanair from London.
        "With this type of misguided economics is it any wonder that regional
Ryanair Holdings PLC Flight cut at Newquay Airport
         tourism in the UK is suffering. The benefits which incoming flights can
         deliver to regions such as Cornwall are incalculable and far exceed the
         derisory income, which will be derived by the Council as a result of
         this tax.
        "In the light of the inevitable reduction in demand, which will ensue
         from this increase in the cost of travel, Ryanair has decided to reduce
         its schedule to a daily flight and will obviously keep this under review
         with the possibility of further reductions in the future if demand
         deteriorates further".

Explanation of the financial impact following adoption of IFRS
Introduction
From 1 April 2005 Ryanair Holdings plc ("Ryanair") is required to prepare its
primary financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards
("IFRS") as adopted for use in the European Union. This change applies to all
financial reporting accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and
consequently, Ryanair's first results to be reported under IFRS are the interim
results for the quarter ending 30 June 2005. The Group's first annual report
under IFRS will be prepared for the financial year to 31 March 2006. Ryanair is
required to publish comparative information from the date of transition except
for certain exemptions provided by the transitional arrangements in IFRS 1
("First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards").
Ryanair's date of transition is 1 April 2004.
Information regarding the adoption by Ryanair of IFRS reporting is presented in
this document as follows;
 1. Summary reconciliation of Ryanair's Income Statement and Balance Sheet from
     Irish/UK GAAP to IFRS for the year ended and as at 31 March 2005;

  7. Statement of Recognised Income and Expense for the year to 31 March 2005
The source of the historical Irish/UK GAAP financial information in this
document is the audited consolidated financial statements and annual report for
the year to 31 March 2004 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements
for the year to 31 March 2005 included in the preliminary announcement of the
Group's results made on 31 May 2005. The audited consolidated financial

     commitments; an increase of EUR2.7 million in derivative financial assets held
     and a corresponding decrease in other creditors, with no amount of
     ineffectiveness recorded in the income statement.

2. Principal Changes under IFRS
The following summary sets out the most significant changes required to
Ryanair's consolidated financial statements as a result of the transition to
IFRS. The effect of these changes is set out in Section 5 of this report.
IAS 19: Pension and other Post Retirement Benefits (recurring change)
In accordance with IAS 19 ("Employee Benefits"), the assets and liabilities of
the defined benefit pension plans operated by Ryanair have been recognised,
gross of deferred tax, in the balance sheet at the date of transition to IFRS in
accordance with the valuation and measurement requirements of the standard.
Deferred tax has been computed in respect of the Group's pension liabilities
arising as a result of the application of IAS 19 and the related deferred tax
assets have been included in the restatements at the various balance sheet
dates.
In accordance with the exemption afforded under the amendment to IFRS 1, the
Group has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses
attributable to its defined benefit pension schemes as at the transition date.
Also in line with the amendment to IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses arising
after the transition date are dealt with in retained income via the Statement of
Recognised Income and Expense, and all other pension scheme movements have been
accounted for in the Group's income statement.
IFRS 3: Business Combinations
The Group has elected to restate the acquisition of Buzz on 10 April 2003 (the
Group's only business combination to date) in accordance with the provisions of
IFRS 3 ("Business Combinations"). As the principal assets and liabilities
acquired at that time related to take-off and landing slots at Stansted airport,
and onerous leases for aircraft, the restatement of the business combination
under IFRS 3 has given rise to the following adjustments:
 1. Reversal of goodwill amortisation since the date of the acquisition
     amounting to EUR4.5 million.
 2. Reallocation of all of the fair value of assets acquired at the time (being
     EUR46.8 million) from goodwill to intangible assets, represented by take-off
     and landing rights ("slots") at Stansted airport. This adjustment was
     required to recognise the fair value of assets required to be recognised
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial Impact
     under the provisions of IFRS 3 and IAS 38 "Intangible Assets". This asset is
     considered to be indefinite lived because the slots do not expire as long as
     they continue to be utilised and it is Ryanair's intention to utilise these
     slots for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the slots acquired have not
     been amortised. The slots acquired have also been subsequently reviewed for
     impairment in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36 "Impairment of
     Assets" and no impairment of this asset is considered to have occurred since
     the date of acquisition.
 3. No change has been recorded to the provisional fair value of onerous leases
     taken over on acquisition as the impact of discounting such amounts is not
     considered to be material in the context of the Group's results. Subsequent
     to the acquisition, however, Ryanair renegotiated the terms and conditions
     of these leases and agreed to return the aircraft to the lessors in late
     2004, thereby releasing Ryanair from any remaining lease obligations at that
     time. Irish GAAP permits that such an adjustment can be made to the
     provisional value of the assets and liabilities acquired as part of the
     original business combination, provided that the adjustment is made either
     in the reporting period that the combination took place or in the first full

      financial period following the transaction. IFRS 3, however, only allows
     such an adjustment to be made in the 12 month period following the
     acquisition, and accordingly, as the event occurred more than 12 months
     after the acquisition date, under IFRS this adjustment is made to the
     Group's income statement instead. This gives rise to a credit of EUR11.9m to
     the income statement in the period to 31 March 2005.
IFRS 2: Share Based Payments (recurring change)
IFRS 2 ("Share Based Payment") requires the Group to recognise any share based
payments made to employees during a reporting period as a charge to the income
statement over the vesting period of the options, together with a corresponding
increase in equity. The charge of EUR0.5 million for the year ended 31 March 2005
for share option grants has been computed using the Binomial Lattice
methodology. A similar charge will recur quarterly over the vesting period of
the existing options and there may be additional charges as further share
options are granted.
Ryanair has availed of the transition provisions in IFRS 1 for share based
payments by only applying the fair value calculation to share option grants that
were made after 7 November 2002 but which had not vested by 1 January 2005 . Had
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial Impact -2-
Ryanair recognised all vested grants of shares between 7 November 2002 and 1
January 2005, the Group's equity at 31 March 2005 would have increased by EUR9.4m
with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.
IAS 39: Derivative Financial Instruments (recurring change)
IAS 39 ("Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement") requires that all
financial instruments are recorded at fair value or amortised cost dependant on
the nature of the financial asset or financial liability. Derivatives are always
measured at fair value with changes in value arising from fluctuations in
interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Under Irish GAAP,
where the derivatives form part of a hedging agreement, these are not initially
measured on the balance sheet and any related gains or losses arising are
deferred until the underlying hedged item impacts on the financial statements.
Ryanair has taken advantage of the exemption from the requirement to restate
comparative information for IAS 39 contained in IFRS 1. As a result of this
exemption the information presented for all periods up to 31 March 2005 has been
accounted for in accordance with Irish/UK GAAP.
At 1 April 2005 Ryanair has accounted for all of its derivatives in accordance
with IAS 39, with the result that an opening charge of EUR146.4 million together
with a related deferred tax benefit of EUR18.3 million has been recorded directly
in opening reserves, principally relating to the company's interest rate swaps,
which were entered into at a time when underlying interest rates were higher
than present market rates. The company also recorded the following entries in
respect of fair value hedges for firm commitments; an increase of EUR2.7 million
in derivative financial assets held and a corresponding decrease in other
creditors, with no amount of ineffectiveness recorded in the income statement.

3. Basis of preparation and transition effects.
Basis of Preparation
EU law (IAS Regulation EC 1606/2002) requires that the annual consolidated
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial Impact -2-
financial statements of the company, for the year ending 31 March 2006, be
prepared in accordance with accounting standards adopted for use in the European
Union (EU) further to the IAS Regulation (EC 1606/2002) ("accounting standards
adopted by the EU").
This preliminary financial information comprising the consolidated preliminary
balance sheets of the company and its subsidiaries at 1 April 2004 and 31 March
2005 and the consolidated preliminary income statement at 31 March 2005 and the
related explanatory notes have been prepared on the basis of the recognition and
measurement requirements of IFRSs in issue that either are adopted by the EU and
effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006 or are expected to
be adopted and effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006, the
Group's first annual reporting date at which it is required to use accounting
standards adopted by the EU. Based on these recognition and measurement
requirements, management has made assumptions about the accounting policies
expected to be applied, which are as set out below, when the first annual
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting standards
adopted by the EU for the financial year ending 31 March 2006.
In particular, management has assumed that the following IFRS's issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board and IFRIC Interpretations issued by the
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee will be adopted by
the EU such that they will be available for use in the annual IFRS financial
statements for the year ending 31 March 2006: Amendment to IAS 19: Actuarial
Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
In addition, the accounting standards adopted by the EU that will be effective
(or available for early adoption) in the annual financial statements for the
year ending 31 March 2006 are still subject to change and to additional
interpretations and therefore cannot be determined with certainty. Accordingly,
the accounting policies for that annual period will be determined finally only
when the annual financial statements are prepared for the year ending 31 March
2006.
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial Impact -2-
The unaudited Group results for the three months to 30 June 2005 and the
comparative quarterly information in the prior periods, also included in this
report, have been prepared on a basis consistent with the IFRS accounting
policies as set out herein. These quarterly financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention, except in respect of certain
financial instruments, which have been fair valued in accordance with the
requirements of IAS 39.
Transition Effects
IFRS 1 permits those companies adopting IFRS for the first time to avail of
certain exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS on transition. Ryanair
intends to avail of the following key exemptions:
   Pensions and post retirement benefits: At the transition date Ryanair has
     re-evaluated its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with IAS 19,
     and all cumulative actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the
     opening balance sheet within pension assets or pension liabilities, and
     adjusted against retained income.
   Financial instruments: Financial instruments in the comparative periods
     are recorded using the existing Irish/UK GAAP basis, rather than being
     restated in accordance with IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
     Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and
     Measurement. The requirements of IAS 32 and 39 will instead be applied from
     1 April 2005, as permitted by IFRS 1.
   Share-based payments: IFRS 2 has been adopted from the transition date
     and is only being applied to equity settled share options granted on or
     after 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005. Ryanair has
     elected to avail of the option not to apply full retrospective application
     of the standard.
   Business combinations: Ryanair has elected to restate its only business
     combination (the acquisition of Buzz on 10 April 2003) to comply with IFRS 3
     "Business Combinations", and has also applied the provisions of IAS 36
     "Impairment of Assets" and IAS 38 "Intangible Assets" from the same date.
Ryanair Holdings plc
Explanation of the financial impact following adoption of IFRS
4. Provisional accounting policies under IFRS
    Basis of Consolidation
     The restated financial information includes the financial statements of the
     company and all subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the relevant period end.
    The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period
     are included in the consolidated income statement from the date on which
     control is transferred to or from the Group. Control exists when the Group
     has the power, either directly or indirectly to govern the financial and
     operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic benefit from its
     activities.
    Estimates and Uncertainties
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial Impact -2-
     The preparation of consolidated financial information requires management to
     make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of
     policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and
     expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
     experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
     under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the
     judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
     readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
     estimates.
    The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
     Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the
     estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the
     period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both
     current and future periods.
    Intangible Assets - Landing Rights
     Intangible assets acquired are recognised to the extent it is considered
     probable that expected future benefits will flow to the Group and the
     associated costs can be measured reliably. Landing rights acquired as part
     of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at that date and are
     not amortised, where those rights are considered to be indefinite. The
     carrying value of these rights are reviewed for impairment at each reporting
     date and are subject to impairment testing when events or changes in

                       RYANAIR ANNOUNCE RECORD Q1 RESULTS
            NET PROFIT RISES 21% TO EUR64.4m - TRAFFIC GROWS 30% TO 8.5M
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (2 August 2005) announced record
profits of EUR64.4m for the Quarter ended 30 June 2005. Traffic grew by 30% to
8.5m passengers, yields increased by 3% and, as a result, total revenues rose by
35% to EUR404.6m. Unit costs increased by 6% (excluding fuel they fell by 9%) as
fuel costs rose by 112% to EUR109.9m. As a result, Ryanair's adjusted after tax
margin for the Quarter fell by 2 points to 16% as Adjusted Net Profit increased
by 21% to EUR64.4m.

Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
Note 1:Adjusted profit after tax and EPS during the Quarter ended 30
June 2005 excludes a receipt, net of tax, of EUR5.2m arising from the
settlement of an insurance claim for the scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200
aircraft.
Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
"These record quarterly results reflect the disciplined and successful roll-out
of Ryanair's low fares model across Europe. The increased profits during the
Quarter - despite the fact that Easter fell in the prior Quarter - underlines
the fundamental strength of the Ryanair low fares model, which delivers
profitable growth even during periods of intense competition and significantly
higher oil prices.
"Yields were 3% higher than last year - slightly better than anticipated -
despite a 30% increase in seat capacity. These higher yields were primarily due
to the multiple fuel surcharges imposed by the European flag carriers on their
short haul passengers, with the latest round of increases imposed in June. These
surcharges continue to widen the gap between their high fares and Ryanair's low
fares. Both Ryanair's traffic growth (+30%) and yields (+3%) have significantly
benefited from our commitment not to impose fuel surcharges on our passengers.
"Bookings were down for a number of days in the immediate aftermath of each of
the two terrorist attacks in London on the 7th and 21st of July. If there are no
further such attacks in London then we expect that our forward bookings will not
be materially impacted. However, if there are further incidents in London, both
bookings and yields could be adversely impacted.
"During the Quarter fuel costs rose by 112% to EUR109.9m. Fuel prices continue to
be high and the market remains volatile. We are unhedged for August but have
hedged 90% of our September volumes at $57 per barrel. Thereafter, we are 90%
hedged for the Winter period (October 2005 to March 2006) at rates equivalent to
$49 per barrel and we continue to closely monitor forward prices with a view to
hedging some or all of our requirements for the early part of Summer 2006.
"Our new routes and bases have developed well over the Summer. Both our Luton
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
and Liverpool bases are performing strongly and traffic at our Shannon base is
running ahead of expectations, although yields continue to be slightly lower
than expected. We recently announced our 14th European base at Pisa in Italy. We
will initially locate 2 aircraft there and have launched a further 3 new routes
from Pisa to Alghero, Dublin and Eindhoven bringing the total routes operated to
/from Pisa to 10. Our growth continues in the UK with 2 new routes from London
Stansted to Toulon in France and Krakow in Poland. We will add a fifth aircraft
to our Liverpool base from the end of September and will launch 4 new routes to
Oslo in Norway, Riga in Latvia, and Bergerac and Carcassone in France. From our
Shannon base, we have recently announced 2 new routes to Bristol in the UK and
Nantes in France.
"During the Quarter we exercised 5 Boeing 737-800 options for delivery in 2007,
1 in February, 1 in March, 1 in April and 2 in May as we continue to see many
more growth opportunities across Europe. The Boeing 737-800 offers Ryanair the
lowest unit operating cost per seat, as well as the technical reliability to
maintain our number 1 on-time performance of any major airline in Europe.
"In Ireland, passengers at Dublin Airport continue to endure third world
facilities. Despite this, the ineffective Regulator is proposing to allow
airport charges to rise by up to 40%. The Regulator has consistently failed to
address the 50% efficiency gap he identified at Dublin Airport 4 years ago, and
is bizarrely proposing to approve capital expenditure for facilities, which do
not have the support of the airline users at the airport. These expenditure
proposals include the construction of a second runway, which is not required
until Dublin's traffic reaches 35m passengers per year (currently at 17m). The
Government has also nominated the inefficient Dublin Airport Authority to build
a second terminal despite the unanimous support of airlines and passengers for
an independent competing terminal. Ryanair has initiated legal proceedings to
force the Government to honour a commitment to open up this inefficient airport
monopoly to competition.
"Our outlook for the remainder of the year is cautious as we continue to budget
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
for higher oil prices but anticipate that these will be partly offset by a
combination of other cost reductions and the current benign yield environment.
Our competitors imposition of further fuel surcharges (up to four in the case of
BA) on their passengers and their removal of capacity from markets is positive
for yields, and we still plan to grow traffic by approximately 27% to 35m
passengers this year. However, further terrorist attacks in London could have a
downward impact on passenger volumes and yields, although, at this early stage
we see no reason to revise our guidance. We anticipate there will be continued
intense competition and that there will be fewer low fare carriers in the
European market as higher fuel prices force loss making carriers out of the
industry. Ryanair's unique combination of the lowest costs, the lowest fares,
and industry leading customer service will, we believe, ensure that Ryanair
continues to grow profitability to the benefit of all our European passengers,
our people and our shareholders".

      circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable. No
     impairment to the carrying values of the Group's intangible assets has been
     recorded to date.
    Revenues
     Scheduled revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline and other
     services, net of government taxes. Revenue from the sale of flight seats is
     recognised in the period in which the service is provided. Unearned revenue
     represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in accrued
     expenses and other liabilities. It is released to the income statement as
     passengers fly. Unused tickets are recognised as revenue on a systematic
     basis. Miscellaneous fees charged for any changes to flight tickets are
     recognised as revenue immediately.
    Ancillary revenues are recognised in the income statement in the period the
     ancillary services are provided.
    Foreign Currency Translation
     Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities
     are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which
     the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The consolidated financial
     statements are presented in Euro, which is the functional currency of each
     of the Group's entities.
    Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
     exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
     liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
     retranslated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date
     and all related exchange gains or losses are accounted for through the
     income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
     currencies are translated to euro at foreign exchange rates ruling at the
     dates the transactions were effected.
    Pensions and Other Post Retirement Obligations
     The Group provides employees with post retirement benefits in the form of
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial -3-
     pensions. The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined
     benefit pension schemes.
    Costs arising in respect of the Group's defined contribution pension schemes
     are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are
     incurred.
    For defined contribution schemes, the Group recognises contributions due in
     respect of the accounting period in the income statement. Any contributions
     unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
    The liabilities and costs associated with the Group's defined benefit
     pension schemes are assessed on the basis of the projected unit credit
     method by professionally qualified actuaries and are arrived at using
     actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the balance sheet
     date. The discount rates employed in determining the present value of each
     scheme's liabilities are determined by reference to market yields at the
     balance sheet date of high quality corporate bonds in the same currency and
     term that is consistent with those of the associated pension obligations.
     The net surplus or deficit arising on the Group's defined benefit schemes is
     shown within non-current assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. The
     deferred tax impact of any such amount is disclosed separately within
     deferred tax.
    IAS 19 requires separate recognition of the operating and financing costs of
     defined benefit pensions (and similarly funded employee benefits) in the
     income statement. The standard permits a number of options for the
     recognition of actuarial gains and losses. In accordance with the exemption
     granted under IFRS 1, IAS 19 has not been applied retrospectively in
     preparing the Group's transition balance sheet to IFRS. All cumulative
     actuarial gains and losses as at the transition date (1 April 2004) have
     therefore been recognised in retained income at that date.
    Share Based Payments
     The Group engages in equity settled share-based payment transactions in
     respect of services received from certain of its employees. The fair value
     of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the
     share options granted on the date of the grant. The cost of the employee
     services received in respect of the share options granted is recognised in
     the income statement over the period that the services are received, which
     is the vesting period with a corresponding credit to equity. The fair value
     of the options granted is determined using the Binomial Lattice option
     pricing model, which takes into account the exercise price of the option,
     the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected
     volatility of the Ryanair Holdings plc share price over the life of the
     option and other relevant factors. Vesting conditions are taken into account
     by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the
     measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount
     recognised in the income statement reflects the number of vested shares or
     share options
    In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 1, Ryanair has applied
     this fair value calculation to share option grants that were made after 7
     November 2002, but which had yet to vest by 1 January 2005.
    Ryanair Holdings plc
     Explanation of the financial impact following adoption of IFRS
    Income taxes, including Deferred Income Taxes
     Income tax payable on taxable profits is recognised as an expense in the
     period in which the profits arise. Income tax recoverable on tax allowable
     losses is recognised as an asset only to the extent that it is probable that
     it will be recovered by offset against current or future taxable profits.
     Income tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that
     relates to items recognized directly in equity (derivative financial
     instruments and pensions and other post retirement obligations), in which
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial -3-
     case it is recognized in equity.
    Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on
     temporary timing differences arising from the tax bases of assets and
     liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
     statements. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and
     legislation enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and
     expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred
     tax liability is settled. The following temporary differences are not
     provided for: the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that effect
     neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to
     investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable they will not
     reverse in the future.
    Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are only offset when they
     arise in the same tax reporting Group and where there is both the legal
     right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and
     settle the liability simultaneously.
    Leases
     Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all
     the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the Group, are
     capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their estimated
     useful lives. The asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value, less
     accumulated depreciation, and the present value of the minimum lease
     payments at the inception of the finance lease. The present values of the
     future lease payments are recorded as obligations under finance leases and
     the interest element of the lease obligation is charged to the income
     statement over the period of the lease in proportion to the balances
     outstanding.
    Expenditure arising under operating leases (being leases where the lessor
     retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership) is charged to
     the income statement as incurred. The Group also enters into sale and
     leaseback transactions whereby it sells the rights to acquire aircraft to a
     third party and subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of operating
     lease. Any profit on the disposal, where the price achieved on the disposal
     of the aircraft is not considered to be at fair value, is spread over the
     lease term. The profit or loss amount deferred is included within other
     creditors and analysed into its components of greater or less than one year.
    Aircraft Maintenance Costs
     The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine
     maintenance checks for owned aircraft is described in the accounting policy
     for tangible fixed assets and depreciation. With respect to the Group's
     operating lease agreements, where the Group has a commitment to maintain the
     aircraft, provision is made during the lease term for the obligation based
     on estimated future costs of major airframe and certain engine maintenance
     checks by making appropriate charges to the income statement calculated by
     reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year.
    All other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted income statement excluding exceptional items referred to below.
Exceptional items for quarter ended June 30, 2005 consisted of a receipt of
EUR5.2m (net of tax) arising from the settlement of an insurance claim for the
scribing of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft.
Profit after tax increased by 31% to EUR69.6m compared to EUR53.1m in the previous
quarter ended June 30, 2004. The adjusted profit for the quarter, excluding
exceptional items, increased by 21% to EUR64.4m.
The results for the quarter and comparative year have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") accounting
policies expected to be adopted in the annual financial statements for the year
ended 31 March 2006, and a detailed explanation of the financial impact of the
adoption of these policies is set out in a separate document issued with these
quarterly financial results for the period to 30 June 2005. A reconciliation
between the Net Income and Shareholders equity under IFRS and Irish/UK GAAP is
attached in Note 2 to this Management Discussion & Analysis.
Summary Quarter ended June 30, 2005
Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR64.4m, compared to EUR53.1m in the previous
quarter ended June 30, 2004. Total operating revenues increased by 35% to
EUR404.6m, which was faster than the 30% growth in passenger volumes, as average
fares rose by 3% and ancillary revenues grew by 44% to EUR58.4m. Total revenue per
passenger as a result increased by 4% whilst load factors remained at 83%.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -3-
Total operating expenses increased by 38% to EUR324.8m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges and airport
& handling costs associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, our largest
cost item, increased by 112% to EUR109.9m due to substantial increases in the US$
cost per gallon, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro to the US$.
Due to the significantly higher fuel costs, Operating margins declined by 2
points to 20%, which in turn resulted in Operating profit increasing by 23% to
EUR79.9m.
Profit before tax increased by 22%, less than the increase in operating profit
due to the higher net interest charges arising from the increased level of debt,
partially offset by foreign exchange gains which arose from the translation of
foreign currency bank balances to Euro at the quarter end exchange rates. Total
unit costs increased by 6% driven by the 112% increase in fuel costs to EUR109.9m.
Excluding fuel costs, total unit costs fell by 9%.
Net Margins declined by 2 points to 16% for the reasons outlined above and
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 21% to 8.47 cent for the Quarter.
Balance Sheet
The Company's increase in profitability continues to generate strong cashflows
from operations, which for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 amounted to EUR213.7m.
This cashflow funded additional aircraft deposits whilst the balance is
reflected in the EUR180.8m increase in Total Cash since March 31, 2005 to
EUR1,786.5m. The Company had no material capital expenditure during the quarter
whilst Long Term Debt, net of repayments, reduced by EUR28.7m. Shareholders' Funds
at June 30, 2005 have reduced by EUR35.5m to EUR1,699.0m, compared to March 31, 2005
reflecting the increase in profitability during the quarter of EUR64.4m offset by
a reduction of EUR114.6m resulting from changes in the accounting treatment for
derivative financial instruments following the adoption of IFRS.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter ended June 30, 2005
Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR64.4m due to a 3% increase in average

costs increasing by 112% to EUR109.9m reflecting the higher US$ cost per gallon.
Operating margins, as a result, fell by 2 points to 20%, which in turn resulted
in Operating profit increasing by 23% to EUR79.9m compared to the previous
quarter.
Total operating revenues increased by 35% to EUR404.6m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 30% to 8.5m. Total revenue per passenger increased by 4% in the
quarter due to a combination of higher average fares and strong ancillary
revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 34% to EUR346.3m due to a combination of

    Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated
     depreciation and provisions for impairments, if any. Depreciation is
     calculated so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of
     assets, on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives at the
     annual rates in the table above.
    Aircraft are depreciated over their estimated useful lives to estimated
     residual values as detailed in the table above.
    An element of the cost of an acquired aircraft is attributed on acquisition
     to its service potential reflecting the maintenance condition of its engines
     and airframe. This cost, which can equate to a substantial element of the
     total aircraft cost, is amortised over the shorter of the period to the next
     check (usually between 8 and 12 years for Boeing 737-800 "next generation"
     aircraft) or the remaining life of the aircraft.
    The costs of subsequent major airframe and engine maintenance checks are
     capitalised and amortised over the shorter of the period to the next check
     or the remaining useful life of the aircraft.
    Advance and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments
     and options are recorded at cost and separately disclosed as part of
     tangible fixed assets. On acquisition of the related aircraft these payments
     are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from that
     date.
    Cash and Cash Equivalents
     Cash represents cash held at bank and available on demand, offset by bank
     overdrafts.
    Cash equivalents are current asset investments (other than cash) that are
     readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Cash equivalents include
     investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposit and cash deposits
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial -4-
     of more than one day, but less than three months. Deposits with a maturity
     of greater than three months are recognised as short term investments.
    Inventories
     Inventories, principally representing rotable aircraft spares, are stated at
     the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on invoiced price
     on a weighted average basis for all stock categories. Net realisable value
     is calculated as estimated selling price net of estimated selling costs.
    Trade and Other Receivables and Payables
     Trade and other receivables and payables are stated at cost less impairment
     losses, which approximates to fair value given the short dated nature of
     these assets and liabilities.
    Derivative Financial Instruments
     Ryanair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity
     prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates. The objective of
     financial risk management at Ryanair is to minimize the impact of commodity
     price, interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the Group's
     earnings, cash flows and equity.
    To manage these risks, Ryanair uses various derivative financial
     instruments, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward
     contracts and commodity contracts. These derivative financial instruments
     are generally held to maturity and are not actively traded. The Group enters
     into these arrangements with the goal of hedging its operational and balance
     sheet risk. However, Ryanair's exposure to commodity price, interest rate
     and currency exchange rate fluctuations cannot be neutralized completely.
    From 1 April 2005, the company has applied the provisions of IAS 39 in
     accounting for its derivatives. Derivative financial instruments are
     recognised initially at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative
     financial instruments are stated at fair value. Recognition of any resultant
     gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
    The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group
     would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking
     into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the
     swap counterparties. The fair value of forward exchange contracts and jet
     fuel contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being
     the present value of the quoted forward price.
    Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the
     variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly
     probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on
     the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. When
     the forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or
     liability, the cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included
     in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. Otherwise the
     cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income
     statement at the same time as the hedged transaction. The ineffective part
     of any hedging transaction and the gain or loss therein is recognised in the
     income statement immediately.
    When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged
     transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that
     point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above
     policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer
     expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in
     equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
    Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the changes in fair value of
     a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, any gain
     or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement. The
     hedged item also is stated at fair value in respect of the risk being
     hedged, with any gain or loss also being recognised in the income statement.
Ryanair Holdings PLC ExplanationofFinancial -4-
    Under Irish GAAP and as applied in the periods to 31 March 2005, Ryanair's
     fuel forward contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate
     swaps were treated as hedges, and any unrealised gains or losses arising on
     those contracts were deferred and recognized as an offset to the related
     expenses, when realized.
    Business Combinations
     The purchase method of accounting is employed in accounting for the
     acquisition of businesses. In accordance with IFRS 3, the cost of a business
     combination is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of
     exchange of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for
     control, together with any directly attributable expenses. The assets and
     liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity are measured
     at their fair values at the date of acquisition. When the initial accounting
     for a business combination is determined provisionally, any adjustments to
     the provisional values allocated are made within twelve months of the
     acquisition date and are effected prospectively from that date.
    Interest Bearing Loans and Borrowings
     All loans and borrowings are initially recorded at cost, being the fair
     value of the consideration received, net of attributable transaction costs.
     Subsequent to initial recognition, non-current interest bearing loans are
     measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest yield methodology.
    Financial Assets
     Financial assets comprise cash deposits of greater than three months
     maturity. All are classified as held to maturity as there is a significant
     financial disincentive from redeeming such amounts at an earlier stage.

a 3% improvement in average fares, increased passenger volumes on existing
routes, and the successful launch of new routes and the new bases at Shannon,
Liverpool and Luton. Load factors remained at 83% for the quarter.
Ancillary revenues increased by 44% to EUR58.4m, significantly faster than the
growth in passenger volumes reflecting a strong performance in non-flight
scheduled revenues, car hire and other ancillary products. Ancillary revenues
now account for 14.4% of total revenues in the quarter compared to 13.5% in the
previous quarter.
Total operating expenses increased by 38% to EUR324.8m due to the increased level
of activity and increased costs, primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route
charges, and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of the
airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by an 8% increase in
the average sector length to 570 miles whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partly
offset by the strength of the Euro exchange rate against the US$.
Staff costs increased by 24% to EUR42.2m, primarily due to a 12% increase in
average employee numbers to 2,764, the impact of pay increases granted of 3%
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
during the quarter, and the increase in the proportion of pilots recruited who
earn a higher than average salary. Pilots accounted for 42% of the increase in
employment during the quarter.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 14% to EUR27.0m. Depreciation charges
increased due to the increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from 56 to 74,
offset by lower amortisation charges due to the retirement of 737-200 and the
positive impact of a new engine maintenance agreement on the cost of
amortisation of 737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the Euro to US$ also had
a positive impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge relating to new
aircraft deliveries.
Fuel costs rose by 112% to EUR109.9m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, an 8% increase in the average sector length, and a significantly higher
average US$ cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the positive impact of
the strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during the period.
Maintenance costs decreased by 2% to EUR13.8m reflecting the improved reliability
arising from the higher proportion of 737's operated, the lower level of
maintenance costs incurred due to the return of six leased 737-300's and the
positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro exchange rates against Sterling
and US$.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 26% to EUR5.3m due to the reduction
in the level of marketing activity and related expenditure compared to the
previous year.
Aircraft rental costs increased by 24% to EUR10.1m reflecting an additional 7
aircraft on lease during the quarter offset by the savings arising from the
return of 6 737-300's to ILFC.
Route charges increased by 25% to EUR41.4m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown and an increase in the average sector length to 570 miles, offset
by a reduction in enroute charges in certain EU countries.
Airport and handling charges increased by 23% to EUR54.6m, which was slower than
the growth in passenger volumes and reflects the impact of increased costs at
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports and bases.
Other expenses increased by 12% to EUR20.5m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues and reflects improved margins on some existing products and
cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 2 points to 20% due to the reasons outlined
above whilst operating profits have increased by 23% to EUR79.9m during the
quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR2.6m to EUR8.6m for the quarter due to the
combined impact of higher levels of cash and cash equivalents and increases in
average deposit rates earned.
Interest payable increased by EUR5.8m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the
purchase of new aircraft.
Foreign exchange gains increased during the quarter to EUR0.9m due to the positive
impact of changes in the Sterling exchange rate against the Euro compared to the
year end.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the growth in profits
during the quarter. The Company generated cash from operating activities of
EUR213.7m. Long Term Debt, net of repayments, reduced by EUR13.4m. Total Cash
continued to reflect the strong trading performance of the Company during the
year and at June 30, 2005 and stood at EUR1,786.5m compared to EUR1,605.7m at March
31, 2005.
Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2005 have reduced by EUR35.5m to EUR1,699.0m,
compared to March 31, 2005 reflecting the increase in profitability during the
quarter of EUR64.4m offset by a reduction of EUR114.6m resulting from changes in the
accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments following the adoption
of IFRS.
                       Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Accounting Policies
    This quarterly financial information has been prepared on the basis of the
     recognition and measurement requirements of International Financial
     Reporting Standards ("IFRS") in issue that either are adopted by the EU and
     effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March 2006 or are expected
     to be adopted and effective (or available for early adoption) at 31 March
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
     2006, the Group's first annual reporting date at which it is required to use
     accounting standards adopted by the EU. Based on these recognition and
     measurement requirements, management has made assumptions about the
     accounting policies expected to be applied, which are as set out below, when
     the first annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with
     accounting standards adopted by the EU for the financial year ending 31
     March 2006. The preliminary accounting policies are set out in the document
     titled "Explanation of the financial impact following adoption of IFRS"
     published today.

         costs in the quarter ended 30 June 2005 (30 June 2004: EUR3.2 million).

                             RYANAIR LAUNCHES 8 NEW
                                ROUTES TO BRITAIN
              4 TO LIVERPOOL, 2 TO LONDON, 1 TO NEWCASTLE & GLASGOW
           LAUNCHES EUROPE WIDE SEAT SALE - 3M REASONS TO VISIT LONDON
In London today (Wednesday, 13th July 2005) Ryanair, the largest passenger
airline in the UK-European market and the number one carrier of overseas
visitors into London unveiled 8 new routes for this Winter's schedule, including
two new destinations with daily flights from London Stansted to Toulon in the
South of France and Krakow in Poland. Ryanair also unveiled four new routes from
its Liverpool base to Oslo, Riga, Carcassonne and Bergerac, as well as a new
route from Newcastle to Oslo and from Glasgow Prestwick to Krakow. As part of
this expansion a fifth aircraft will now be based in Liverpool from 27th
September next.
Ryanair also announced this morning that it would launch a major tourism drive
Ryanair Holdings PLC 8 New Routes to Britain
to encourage visitors to come to London by releasing 3 million seats at a price
of just GBP1 or EUR1 plus taxes, which have gone on sale on Ryanair's website at
www.ryanair.com for travel during August, September and October 2005. This seat
sale will be backed up with a Pan European GBP5 million advertising campaign over
the next 3 months featuring London and a range of other British cities.
Speaking this morning in London, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
        "Ryanair decided to bring forward these route launches and this seat
         sale from September to the middle of July because we believe the best
         response to last weeks terrorist attacks is for ordinary people to
         continue to live their lives as normal, and to continue to travel as
         before. It is more important than ever that the leading players in
         London and British tourism such as Ryanair make it even more attractive
         for visitors to come to London this Autumn and show the terrorists that
         we will not be put off by their atrocities.
        "We are delighted with our two new routes to London from Krakow in
         Poland and Toulon in the South of France and we are particularly pleased
         with the continued expansion of our successful Liverpool base, which is
         growing rapidly. We expect that traffic at Liverpool will continue to
         grow, particularly as the city becomes Europe's capital of culture in
         2006.
        "These 3 million seats went on sale on our website at Ryanair.com this
         week and will remain available for booking until midnight on Monday next
         for travel during the months of August, September and October 2005.
         However, since seats at these low prices during the peak Summer period
         are a rarity, we would encourage all visitors to London to snap them up
         quickly as there will be huge demand for them".

Speaking this morning, Ryanair Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
        "Ryanair is lowering its fares in this biggest ever 3 million seat sale
         to ensure that passengers keep on flying. Last week's appalling attacks
         in London must not be allowed to succeed in their twisted goal of
         paralysing us with "fear, terror and panic." The best way for all of us
         to make our stand against these acts is to continue to travel. Travel is
         essential for our economy and tourism industry and Ryanair is today
         lowering 3 million fares in its biggest ever seat sale to ensure we can
         all do our part to fight back".

                 RYANAIR LAUNCH 2 NEW ROUTES TO BRISTOL AND NANTES
                  10,000 seats to BRISTOL for      EUR0.99*
                  5,000 seats to NANTES for        EUR2.99*
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 7th July 2005)
announced two new routes from its Shannon base to Bristol and Nantes. The new
route to Bristol will start daily on 30th October 2005 and the new route to
Nantes will operate 3 times a week from 1st November 2005, bringing the total
number of destinations served by Ryanair at Shannon to 16. In addition, Ryanair
announced a frequency increase from 1 to 4 flights per week on its Frankfurt
route, starting 31st October 2005. This expansion will result in an additional
200,000 passengers per annum at Shannon.
Announcing the expansion at Shannon today, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, said:
        "The Shannon base has exceeded our expectations since its launch in May
         and has firmly established itself as one of the most important drivers
         of both tourism and the economy in the West of Ireland. Today's new
         routes to Bristol and Nantes and the frequency increase to Frankfurt
Ryanair Holdings PLC 2new routes to Bristol&Nantes
         means that 1.5 M passengers at Shannon over the next year will benefit
         from Ryanair's lowest fares and save over EUR150M compared to the high
         fare airlines.
        "These new flights are available for booking today on www.ryanair.com
         from 99 cents* and passengers are advised to book their seats
         immediately as demand for these new destinations will be very strong."
In welcoming the Ryanair announcement, Niall Gibbons, Director of Corporate
Services in Tourism Ireland, said:
        "Increasing air access into the island of Ireland is fundamental in our
         goal of increasing the number of overseas tourists. Global competition
         has never been stronger so we need to motivate consumers with compelling
         offers and reasons to visit, combined with a range of
         competitively-priced access options to a variety of locations on the
         island. Ryanair's decision to open new routes from France and England
         means that even more potential visitors now have low-cost access direct
         into Shannon. This builds on the already excellent direct access into
         the regions and will do much to spread the benefits of tourism into the
         Western seaboard".

                    NO FUEL SURCHARGES AT RYANAIR - GUARANTEED
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Friday, 24th June 2005) had its
prediction confirmed when BA yet again ripped-off its passengers by adding a 4th
fuel surcharge onto their already sky high fares. BA's fuel surcharges will now
increase to GBP16 return on short haul tickets and GBP48 on long haul trips.
Speaking this morning, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications said:
        "BA has reacted to higher oil prices by continuing to rip-off passengers
         with yet another fuel surcharge, which adds between GBP16 to GBP48 onto the
         price of a return ticket. Why don't BA reduce other costs instead of
         always gouging their passengers? BA's fuel surcharges are now higher
         than most of Ryanair's airfares.
        "Only Ryanair GUARANTEESno fuel surcharge on all of our fares, not now,
         not ever. The only way passengers can guarantee that they won't pay fuel
         surcharges is by booking with Ryanair, Europe's largest and lowest fare
         airline".

            RYANAIR'S ON-TIME PERFORMANCE BEATS THE BEST OF THE U.S.
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 23rd June 2005)
celebrated beating the best of the U.S. airlines for punctuality in April 2005.

European Airlines each month, but also, based on a comparison with the latest
punctuality statistics issued by the U.S. Department of Transport, Ryanair
emerges as No. 1 for punctuality ahead of the major US airlines for April 2005.
Speaking this afternoon, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Peter Sherrard said:
        "When it comes to punctuality, Ryanair leaves the best of the U.S.
         behind. We have out-preformed all the major U.S airlines in 2003 & 2004
         and this trend is continuing into 2005, with average overall punctuality
         for U.S. airlines in April at 83.4% compared to Ryanair's 94% of flights
         on time*. Not only is Ryanair the No. 1 airline for low fares and
         punctuality in Europe, we are also unbeatable for on-time performance,
         even when compared to the major U.S. airlines.
        "Our 35 million passengers this year know that Ryanair delivers the
         lowest fares coupled with the best customer service and on-time

Announcing the new routes in London today, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, said;
        "We launched our first route in Poland just three months ago from
         London-Stansted to Wroclaw and with these two new routes to Lodz and
         Poznan, Ryanair will serve more Polish airports (7) directly from London
         that any other airline.
        "We are delighted also to announce our first new route to Kaunas in
         Lithuania.
        This route will operate daily and we expect to carry in excess of
         100,000 passengers in our first year of operation.
        "Our new daily service to Grenoble in south-east France means that UK
         passengers need no longer pay the high fares of Easyjet which are over
         20 times** more expensive than Ryanair.
        "Today's announcement of increased frequency on our routes from London
         Stansted to Seville, Granada, Derry, Riga and Tampere will allow us to
         offer up to double daily flights to each of these exciting cities and
         will allow us to provide even more low fares and unbeatable punctuality
         for European consumers.
        "These four new routes and additional frequencies will mean an
         additional 650,000 passengers per annum will save over GBP65M each year
         over the high fares charged by other airlines such as Easyjet, British
         Airways and LOT."

                   ANNOUNCES "50% OFF OUR LOWEST FARES" SEAT SALE
    Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 31 May 2005)
     celebrated its 20th birthday by announcing record results for the year end
     31 March 2005. Both passenger volumes and net profits grew by 19% to 27.6m
     and EUR268.9m respectively. Yields were 2% higher than last year (partially
     offsetting the 14% yield decline in 2003/04) and ancillary revenues grew by
     40%, much faster than passenger volumes, which resulted in total revenues
     rising by 24% to EUR1.337bn. Operating costs rose by 25%, fractionally faster
     than the growth in revenues reflecting higher fuel costs. As a result,
     Ryanair's adjusted after tax margin for the full year fell by just 1% to an
     industry leading 20% as Adjusted Net Profit increased by 19% to a record
     EUR268.9m.

         from the earlier than planned retirement of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft,
         the reorganisation of "Buzz" in April '03 of EUR2.7m (net of tax), and a
         goodwill charge of EUR2.3m in 2004 and EUR2.1m in 2005.
    Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
    "We can think of no better way to celebrate Ryanair's 20th birthday than to
     announce another year of record traffic and record profits, with after tax
     margins at an industry leading 20%. Our robust trading performance over the
     past 12 months, despite intense competition and significantly higher oil
     prices reaffirms the unique strength of Ryanair's lowest cost model in
     Europe. While many airlines recorded losses, Ryanair increased after tax
     profits for the Winter half year by 33% from EUR51.0m to EUR67.6m, while our
     year end cash balances increased to EUR1.61 billion equating to 121% of annual
     revenues.
    "Contrary to initial expectations, average yields for the 12 months rose by
     2%, despite a 16% increase in capacity. This is partially due to the lower
     comparables last year (when yields fell by 14%), and continuing capacity
     reductions by the European flag carriers in markets where they compete with
     Ryanair. Most of our yield growth was due to multiple fuel surcharges
     imposed by the flag carriers on short-haul passengers, which have further
     widened the gap between their high fares and our low fares. Ryanair's
     traffic growth and yields have benefited substantially from our refusal to
     impose fuel surcharges.
    "Clearly fuel costs remain high, and the market is volatile. Higher oil
     prices will continue to impact our cost base over the coming 12 months. We
     are unhedged for the remainder of this Summer and are benefiting from the
     recent oil price declines. In order to remove some cost uncertainty during
     the volatile Winter period, we have now hedged 75% of next Winter's fuel
     requirement at rates equivalent to $47 per barrel. We will continue to
     exploit our hedging policy where we believe it can remove uncertainty from
     our business at acceptable cost levels.
    "Our new routes and bases continue to perform well. We have been most
     encouraged by the strong advance bookings at our new Luton and Liverpool
     bases where passengers are looking for an alternative to Easyjet's high
     prices. Traffic at our new Shannon base is also booking strongly, although
     yields have been slightly lower than we expected. Recently we announced five
     new routes from London to Poland (4) and Slovakia (1) and expect that these
     will be the first in a series of new route announcements over the coming
     weeks for next Winter.
    "Without question, the single most important initiative of the past 12
     months was the purchase of 140 additional Boeing 737-800's (comprising 70
     firm and 70 options), for delivery during the period 2008 - 2012, at a
     substantial discount to our previous competitively priced aircraft order.
    This new order, which also included the repricing of the balance of the
     previous order, will enable Ryanair to significantly reduce our aircraft per
     seat operating costs, and substantially improve our cash balances, while we
     maintain a disciplined rate of passenger growth out to 2012, by which time
     we expect to carry over 70m passengers per annum, making Ryanair, Europe's
     largest airline. We expect to overtake British Airways' monthly traffic
     later this Summer. This will be a very significant milestone for a small
     Irish airline which only started flying in 1985 and yet in just over 20
     years (thanks to low fares, lowest costs and brand new Boeing aircraft) has
     overtaken British Airways.
    "On the regulatory front, we were pleased with the recent settlement of the
     fuel levy dispute with the BAA at Stansted Airport, which will reduce the
     fuel levy for all airlines at Stansted for the coming 3 years. We continue
     to lobby against the BAA's grandiose plans at Stansted Airport for a
     gold-plated second runway. When the cost of a runway and even a second
     terminal should run to no more than GBP400m, the BAA's proposed spend of GBP4
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Financial Results
     billion is gold-plating on a rip off scale, which will result in
     overcharging of ordinary passengers for many decades into the future.
    "If the BAA monopoly was broken up, and Stansted forced to compete with
     Gatwick and Heathrow, then low cost efficient facilities would be developed
     with the co-operation of user airlines like Ryanair and Easyjet. Instead we
     have the truly bizarre proposal that GBP4 billion be wasted by Stansted,
     building facilities that its airlines unanimously oppose, with part of the
     cost to be subsidized by passengers at Gatwick and Heathrow (who get no
     benefit from Stansted) and all of this waste is designed so that the BAA
     airport monopoly can claim a return on GBP4 billion of capital expenditure
     instead of GBP400 million. The CAA presently stands idly by while the BAA
     ignores the stated wishes of the very airline users at Stansted who are
     expected to pay for these extravagant and over specified facilities.
    "In Ireland, the situation at Dublin Airport has descended into a farce. The
     Dublin Airport Authority which is responsible for this third world facility
     is to be rewarded for its incompetence by being allowed to build the second
     terminal. This facility will not be available until 2009 at the earliest and
     in the mean time passengers at Dublin will be forced to endure long queues
     and intolerable overcrowding while the Government protects this failed
     monopoly by blocking competition. It should be remembered that thirteen
     expressions of interest to build and operate this second terminal were
     received by the Irish Government as far back as October 2002, many of them
     from established airport operators who were prepared to invest in and offer
     genuine competition at Dublin.
    "The Taoiseach (Prime Minister) recently demonstrated how hopelessly out of
     touch he is by claiming that the present overcrowded terminal has the
     capacity for 6 million more passengers per annum. It would appear that there
     aren't any queues at the VIP escort to the Government jet. "We have
     instructed our lawyers to prepare the necessary papers to oppose this second
     terminal on competition and public procurement grounds. We will also
     vigorously oppose any planning application which is based on over specified
     or inefficient terminal facilities, which is all that the DAA have ever
     developed either here at Dublin, or Cork, or Shannon. Had the Irish
     Government heeded Ryanair's calls for a competing second terminal seven
     years ago, this current embarrassment for Irish tourism would have been
     avoided. As always in Ireland the ordinary passengers suffer, while the
     politicians fudge.
    "Our outlook for the coming 12 months is more positive than it was this time
     last year. We continue to budget for higher oil prices, but anticipate that
     these higher costs will be partially offset by a slightly more benign yield
     environment. If our competitors continue to maintain surcharges or continue
     to remove capacity from our markets then yields should be more stable, even
     as we continue to expand. Advance bookings for the Summer months are strong,
     and we are raising our traffic growth forecast for the coming year from 34m
     (+23%) to 35m (+27%). We expect that ancillary sales will continue to
     significantly outstrip traffic growth. Our new aircraft pricing and new
     airport deals will continue to have a downward impact on operating costs
     even though fuel volatility will remain a variable.
    "It is becoming increasingly clear that being the lowest cost operator is
     the key competitive advantage in our industry. There is no better business
     model in the short haul market. Lowest cost wins. Like Wal-mart, Tesco and
     Dell in their respective markets, Ryanair's low fares cannot be matched nor
     beaten by any of our competitors. As the published statistics for

   1. Accounting Policies
     The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these consolidated
     financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2005 are consistent with
     those set out in the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2004.
 2. Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
     The Board of Directors approved the preliminary announcement document, which
     will form the basis of the Group's consolidated financial statements for the
     year ended March 31, 2005 on May 27, 2005.
 3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
     The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the year ended March
     31, 2005 are based on the results reported under Irish and UK GAAP.
 4. Aircraft retirement costs
     Six aircraft were retired earlier than projected in 2003 due to the
     detection of scratch marks ('scribing') that occurred during an
     aircraft painting programme on these aircraft in 1995. It had been
     determined that the cost of repairing these aircraft was uneconomic
     due to the short remaining life of the aircraft. Accordingly the
     Company had determined that the residual value of US$1m (EUR794k) for
     these aircraft was excessive and as a result reduced it to EUR250k per
     aircraft. The cost of this adjustment charge for five aircraft was
     reflected in the results for the quarter ended September 30,2003,
     and the charge for a sixth aircraft was expensed in quarter ended
     December 31, 2003.

                    Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
    Introduction
    For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to
     the adjusted profit and loss account excluding the exceptional costs and
     goodwill referred to below.
    Exceptional costs in the year ended March 31,2004 consisted of
     re-organisation costs of EUR2.7m (net of tax), EUR11.6m in lease costs (net of
     tax), and an additional depreciation charge of EUR3.3m relating to an
     adjustment to the residual value of six Boeing 737-200 aircraft that were
     retired earlier than planned (Note 4). Goodwill of EUR2.1m was amortised in
     this financial year compared to EUR2.3m in the year ended March 31, 2004.
    Profit after tax increased by 29% to EUR266.7m compared to EUR206.6m in the
     previous year ended March 31,2004. The adjusted profit for the year,
     excluding exceptional costs and goodwill, increased by 19% to EUR268.9m.
    Summary Year ended March 31, 2005
    Profit after tax increased by 19% to EUR268.9m, compared to EUR226.6m in the
     previous year ended March 31, 2004. Total operating revenues increased by
     24% to EUR1,336.6m, which was faster than the 19% growth in passenger volumes,
     as average fares rose by 2% and ancillary revenues grew by 39% to EUR208.5m.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Financial Results -4-
     Total revenue per passenger as a result increased by 4%, whilst the
     successful launch of new routes and the slower rate of growth in turn led to
     load factors increasing by 3 points to 84%.
    Total operating expenses increased by 25% to EUR1,007.1m, due to the increased
     level of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges
     and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
     Fuel, our largest cost item, increased by 52% due to substantial increases
     in the US$ cost per gallon, partially offset by the strengthening of the
     Euro to the US dollar.
    Despite the sharp rise in fuel costs Operating margins have been maintained
     at 25%, which in turn resulted in Operating profit increasing by 22% to
     EUR329.5m. Profit before tax increased by 19%, less than the increase in
     operating profit due to the higher net interest charge arising from the
     increased level of debt, and foreign exchange losses which arose from the
     translation of sterling and US$ bank balances to euro at the year end
     exchange rates. Net Margins have declined by 1 point to 20% for the reasons
     outlined above.
    Adjusted earnings per share have increased by 18% to 35.4 cent for the year.
    Balance Sheet
    The Company's profit growth continues to generate strong cashflow from
     operations, which for the year to March 31, 2005 amounted to EUR530.5m. This
     cashflow part funded the extensive aircraft delivery programme, additional
     aircraft deposits, whilst the balance remaining is reflected in the EUR356.3m
     increase in Cash and Liquid Resources since March 31, 2004. Capital
     expenditure net of sales proceeds amounted to EUR616.9m during the year whilst
     Long Term Debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR461.9m. Shareholders' Funds
     at March 31, 2005 have increased by EUR272.2m to EUR1,727.4m, compared to March
     31, 2004.
    Detailed Discussion and Analysis Year ended March 31, 2005
    Profit after tax, increased by 19% to EUR268.9m due to a 2% increase in
     average fares, and strong ancillary revenue growth which was partly offset
     by fuel costs increasing by 52% reflecting the higher US$ cost per gallon.
     Operating margins have remained constant at 25%, which has resulted in
     Operating profit increasing by EUR58.6m to EUR329.5m compared to last year.
    Total operating revenues increased by 24% to EUR1,336.6m whilst passenger
     volumes increased by 19% to 27.6m. Total revenue per passenger has increased
     by 4% in the year due to a combination of higher average fares and strong
     ancillary revenue growth.
    Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 22% to EUR1,128.1m due to a
     combination of a 2% improvement in average fares, increased passenger
     volumes on existing routes, and the successful launch of new bases at
     Rome-Ciampino, and Barcelona-Girona. The slower growth in passenger volumes
     is also reflected in improved load factors, which rose by 3 points to 84% in
     the year.
    Ancillary revenues increased by 39% to EUR208.5m, faster than the growth in
     passenger volumes, reflecting a strong performance in non-flight scheduled
     revenues, car hire and other ancillary products. Ancillary revenues now
     account for 16% of total revenues compared to 14% for 2004.
    Total operating expenses increased by 25% to EUR1,007.1m due to the increased
     level of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals,
     route charges, and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of
     the airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by a 10%
     increase in the average sector length whilst higher US$ fuel prices were
     partly offset by the strength of the euro exchange rate against the US$.
    Staff costs have increased by 14% to EUR141.0m primarily due to a 14% increase
     in average employee numbers to 2,604 and the impact of pay increases of 3%
Ryanair Holdings PLC Full Year Financial Results -4-
     granted during the year partly offset by savings in sterling denominated
     salaries due to the weakening of the sterling to euro exchange rate.
    Depreciation and amortisation increased by 1% to EUR98.7m. Depreciation
     charges increased due to an increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from
     62 to 74, offset by lower amortisation charges due to the retirement of
     737-200 aircraft and the positive impact of a new engine maintenance
     agreement on the cost of amortisation of 737-800 aircraft. The strengthening
     of the euro to US$ during the year also had a positive impact on the
     depreciation and amortisation charge relating to new aircraft deliveries.
    Fuel costs rose by 52% to EUR265.3m due to an increase in the number of
     sectors flown, a 10% increase in the average sector length, and a
     significantly higher average US$ cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by
     the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US dollar during
     the year.
    Maintenance costs decreased by 13% to EUR37.9m reflecting the improved
     reliability arising from the higher proportion of 737-800's operated and a
     lower level of maintenance costs incurred due to the return of four BAE 146
     aircraft to KLM and the release of maintenance overhaul provisions of EUR5.2m
     during the year associated with the earlier than scheduled return of six
     leased 737-300's.
    Marketing and distribution costs increased by 22% to EUR19.6m due to increases
     in expenditure arising from the higher level of activity during the year.
     Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR21.9m to EUR33.5m reflecting the full year
     cost of leasing 10 737-800 aircraft plus the lease costs associated with
     three deliveries during the third quarter. These costs were offset by the
     return of four BAE 146s and six leased 737-300 aircraft to KLM and ILFC
     respectively during the year.
    Route charges increased by 23% to EUR135.7m due to an increase in the number
     sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in
     the weight of the aircraft operated (which incur a higher charge).
    Airport and handling charges increased by 21% to EUR178.4m, due to an increase
     in the number of passenger flown, and the impact of increased costs at
     certain existing airports offset by lower costs at new airports.
    Other expenses increased by 24% to EUR97.0m, which is less than the growth in
     ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing
     products, and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
    Operating margins have remained constant at 25% due to the reasons outlined
     above whilst operating profits increased by EUR58.6m to EUR329.9m during the
     year.
    Interest receivable has increased by EUR4.4m due to the combined impact of
     higher levels of cash and liquid resources and an improvement in average
     deposit interest rates earned in the year compared to last year.
     Interest payable increased by EUR9.9m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund
     the purchase of new aircraft.
    Foreign exchange gains/(losses) has changed from a gain of EUR3.2m to a loss
     of EUR2.3m in the current year due to the negative impact of changes in the
     sterling exchange rate against the euro.
    The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the growth in
     profits during the year. The Company generated cash from operating
     activities of EUR530.5m, which part funded additional capital expenditure of
     EUR616.9m. Capital expenditure primarily comprised of the delivery of 24
     aircraft and advance payments for future aircraft deliveries. Long term
     Debt, net of repayments increased by EUR461.9m, which was drawn down to part
     fund aircraft deliveries during the year. Cash and liquid resources
     continued to reflect the strong trading performance of the company during
     the year and at March 31, 2005 stood at EUR1,613.6m compared to EUR1,257.4 at

Announcing Ryanair's new routes in London today, Michael Cawley, Deputy CEO
said:
        "In 2004 Michael O'Leary said: "Who wants to go to Gdansk? There ain't a
         lot there after you've seen the shipyard wall". There he goes - wrong

         added appeal of its proximity to Vienna, a destination which until today
         could only be accessed at prohibitively high fares.
         "These five new routes mean British passengers will save over GBP60M on
         the high fares of other airlines and will benefit from Ryanair's
         unbeatable punctuality and customer service".

                  RYANAIR AWARDS 3% PAY INCREASE TO EMPLOYEES
                ONE OF THE HIGHEST PAY EU AIRLINES JUST GOT BETTER
Ryanair today (Tuesday, 17th May 2005) confirmed that following a round of
direct negotiations with its staff in the month of April, it had implemented a
3% pay increase backdated to 1st April 2005.
This 3% increase will apply to all staff groups across Europe who participated
in the direct negotiations with the Company. Only the Dublin based pilots chose
not to negotiate directly with the Company and as a result they have not at this
time enjoyed a pay increase, however the door remains open to this group should
they choose to avail of it. All of Ryanair's other people will benefit.
Ryanair's Director of Personnel, Eddie Wilson said:
        "This salary increase is a reward for the productivity and the
         dedication of our people who continue to work hard to make Ryanair
         Europe's No 1 low fares airline. While traffic growth remains strong,
         higher oil prices mean that cost control remains vital.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY awards 3% pay increase
        "Despite high oil prices and over capacity in many European markets,
         Ryanair will again be one of the few airlines in Europe to award salary
         increases and secure careers for our people. This pay increase
         reinforces the strength of Ryanair's model whereby people negotiate
         directly with the Company and as a result enjoy better pay and
         conditions than our low pay unionised competitors".

                 RYANAIR LAUNCHES 12th EUROPEAN BASE AT SHANNON
        20,000 FREE* SEATS TO LONDON, LIVERPOOL, NOTTINGHAM AND DUSSELDORF
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 4th May 2005) marked
the launch of its new base at Shannon Airport with a 20,000 Free* Seat Sale.
Ryanair now operates 26 daily flights on 14 international routes to and from
Shannon Airport and this year will carry 1.5 million passengers through the
airport.
Speaking in Shannon today, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, said;
        "Ryanair's EUR240M investment in Shannon will deliver 1.5 million
         passengers for the airport this year, bringing a massive boost to
         tourism and jobs in the mid-west and establishing Shannon as the low
         cost gateway to Ireland.
        "Over 400,000 bookings have already been made for travel this summer on
         these routes and in the first week of operations alone, Ryanair will
         carry over 30,000 passengers to and from Shannon.
        "To mark this new base we are offering 20,000 free* seats on 4 of our
         new routes during May and June. Passengers are advising passengers to
         book their free* flight online at www.ryanair.com immediately because
Ryanair Holdings PLC 12th European Base at Shannon
         demand will be very strong".
Pat Shanahan, Chairman of the Shannon Airport Authority said:
        "Ryanair's development at Shannon will provide an unprecedented boost to
         tourism and business activity, thus enabling the airport to continue to
         fulfill its key role as the economic generator for the entire West of
         Ireland. Ryanair will contribute significantly to the expected growth of
         a million extra passengers through Shannon Airport in 2005".
Ryanair's new Shannon base will be serviced by new Next Generation Boeing
737-800 aircraft.
Speaking from Shannon, John Reuland, Boeing's Director of Marketing, said:
        "The economics and reliability of the Boeing Next Generation 737 are key
         to Ryanair's success and we are delighted to be here today to support
         that growth. Our partnership today could not be more visible with the
         arrival of the special Ryanair/Boeing Best in the Blue aircraft,
         bringing the first of many millions of visitors from Europe to Shannon
         and the West of Ireland".
Niall Gibbons, Director Corporate Services, Tourism Ireland, said:
        "Ryanair's decision to open a base in Shannon means that visitors across
         Great Britain and Continental Europe now have low-cost access direct
         into the heart of the Western seaboard. Air access capacity to the
         island of Ireland will be at an all-time high this summer and Shannon
         will see the greatest proportional capacity increase, driven largely by
         these new services from Ryanair".

                   RYANAIR ANNOUCES AGREEMENT FOR A NEW BASE
                                AT LUEBECK AIRPORT
         4 AIRCRAFT, 10 ROUTES AND 2M PASSENGERS PER ANNUM FOR LUEBECK
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 14th April 2005)
announced it has reached agreement with Infratil to base up to 4 new 737
aircraft and deliver up to 2 million passengers per annum to Luebeck airport.
This agreement is subject to the successful completion of a conditional purchase
agreement between Infratil and the City of Luebeck announced on (14) April.
Settlement of the transaction is expected to occur a few months' time
Infratil is an international airport and infrastructure investor, which owns
Wellington International Airport and Glasgow Prestwick Airport. The agreement
builds on the success of Ryanair's base at Glasgow Prestwick Airport where
Ryanair has 5 based aircraft and in the current year the airline will operate 17
international routes and carry 2.4 million passengers.
Ryanair Holdings PLC New Base at Luebeck Airport
Ryanair would operate a network of low fare scheduled international routes from
Luebeck to the UK and Europe and would deliver 2 million passengers in the first
year of this base. Ryanair will invest over $250M in 4 new B737 aircraft and
create over 200 new jobs in Luebeck. The massive increase in passenger traffic
would boost Hamburg Luebeck to the top ten international airports in Germany
(nudging Leipzig/Halle off the number 10 spot with 2,026,550 passengers in
2004).
According to ACI figures, these 2 million passengers will generate 2,000 new
jobs in the Luebeck region, with the first 200 of these being direct Ryanair
employees (pilots, cabin crew, engineers, etc).
Commenting on the deal today, Ryanair's COO and Deputy CEO Michael Cawley said:
        "Our agreement with Infratil to base aircraft and deliver substantial
         passenger volumes to Luebeck Airport demonstrates the success of the low
         fares model of using low cost secondary airports. This new base would
         revolutionise the future growth of Luebeck Airport and represents an
         investment of $250 million by Ryanair in Luebeck. This new base would
         make Luebeck Airport the low cost gateway to Luebeck and the entire
         region of Northern Germany and would promote tourism access to the
         region for UK and European visitors. The new base would also mean that
         passengers using Luebeck Airport would enjoy even more of Germany's
         lowest ever air fares with Germany's cheapest airline. Ryanair looks
         forwarded to working with Infratil to realize this ambition and
         revolutionise air traffic at Luebeck airport".

BAA and Ryanair have agreed an out of court settlement which brings to an end
the legal challenges surrounding the scale of fuel levy charges at Stansted

Ryanair has paid BAA the amount which it had previously withheld because of the
dispute with the airport about the rate of the fuel levy charge. BAA has
withdrawn its claims that Ryanair committed a repudiatory breach of its contract
at Stansted.
As from 1 April 2005, BAA is reducing its fuel levy charge at Stansted from
0.68p per litre to 0.412p per litre. This agreement will last until the next
regulatory review period starts in April 2008. As a result of this agreement,
the fuel levy savings to Ryanair will exceed GBP1million per annum.

                       RYANAIR CALLS AUC'S REPORT IRRELEVANT
           DURING WEEK WHEN BRITISH AIRWAYS IMPOSES A FOURTH FUEL SURCHARGE
Ryanair, Europe's lowest fare airline today (Tuesday, 22nd March 2005) called
the AUC's report on airline website pricing irrelevant to consumers now
suffering a fourth fuel surcharge at the hands of British Airways.
Michael Cawley, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer
said:
     "The AUC's report on airline website pricing is irrelevant for the
      following reasons:
     1.   All media advertising of airline prices in the UK are fully tax
           inclusive and it is this advertising that brings people onto airline
           websites. No consumer is confused or misled.
     2.   It is only fair to consumers that airline websites should separately
           show the ridiculous level of airport charges and government taxes
           which in the case of so many Ryanair prices are higherthan the actual
           fare paid to the airline. It is appropriate that this extortionate tax
           and charging regime should be highlighted for consumers.
     3.   All passengers on the Ryanair website see a detailed breakdown of
           the net fare, and all taxes, fees and charges before they are asked
Ryanair Holdings PLC AUC's report irrelevant
           to confirm either their booking or the payment. If any passenger is
           unhappy with the pricing or the taxes, fees and charges they simply
           don't confirm the booking.
     4.   The AUC as usual is silent on the fourth round of price gouging fuel
           surcharges being imposed by British Airways and other airlines, when
           only Ryanair guarantees there will be no fuel surcharges now or ever.
     "The travelling public are only concerned about the total cost of the
      airline ticket which is why 34 million passengers this year will choose
      Ryanair, the only airline in all markets to consistently offer the lowest
      air fares. 34 million consumers cannot be wrong. They have no difficulty
      navigating the Ryanair website, and are continue to be delighted with the
      enormous savings that Ryanair air fares offer over every other airline in
      the UK and in Europe. Nobody beats Ryanair's prices and nobody beats
      Ryanair's customer service either".

Ryanair Holdings PLC
24 February 2005
                     RYANAIR ORDERS 140 MORE BOEING 737-800s
                   70 FIRM AIRCRAFT VALUED AT OVER $4 BILLION
                      2,500 NEW JOBS TO BE CREATED IN RYANAIR
Ryanair, Europe's lowest cost airline this morning (Thursday, 24th February
2005) placed an order for a further 140 Boeing 737-800 series aircraft. The
order comprises of 70 firm aircraft valued at over $4 billion and 70 options.
This agreement (which is subject to shareholder approval at an EGM) brings the
total Ryanair/Boeing order book up to 225 firm aircraft and 193 options.
At the end of 2005, Ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new Boeing
737-800's (from the original 155 firm order) and these 70 new firm orders, which
are due for delivery primarily between 2008 and 2012 will allow Ryanair to
maintain its planned double digit growth during the latter years of this decade.
When all these firm aircraft have been delivered, Ryanair (which in the fiscal
Ryanair Holdings PLC 140more Boeing 737-800's
year to March 2006 expects to carry 34m. passengers) anticipates that it will
carry in excess of 70m. passengers p.a., making it Europe's largest airline.
These 70 new aircraft will result in the creation of more than 2,500 new highly
paid jobs in Ryanair principally for pilots, cabin crew and engineering people.
Half of these jobs will be generated at the airlines existing 12 European bases,
with the remainder at the 10 or more new bases which will be developed by
Ryanair over the next seven years.
This increased $4 billion aircraft order is the result of a Ryanair-Boeing
agreement on improved pricing from 2005 onward. The agreement reinforces the
Ryanair-Boeing partnership as it delivers the lowest per seat aircraft cost in
Europe. The transaction also includes agreement on winglet modifications to
Ryanair's entire fleet (delivering a 2% reduction in fuel consumption) and
improved support terms. As a result of this agreement, Ryanair will now enjoy
the lowest per seat operating cost in Europe, and this will enable Ryanair to
widen its lowest cost/lowest fare leadership over all other European airlines.
Announcing this agreement in London this morning, Ryanair's Chairman, David
Bonderman said:
        "The Boeing 737-800 series aircraft is the most efficient narrowbody
         shorthaul aircraft in the world. Since its introduction into the Ryanair
         fleet in March 1999 it has transformed our technical reliability, making
         Ryanair the No. 1 on time major airline in Europe. At the same time, the
         737-800 has significantly reduced our unit operating costs and allowed
         us to reduce air fares each year for the last five years. With this new
         order and new pricing in place, Ryanair expects that unit operating
         costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five
         years. This will enable Ryanair to offer even lower fares and underpin
         our growth strategy as we plan to double traffic from 34m. passengers in
         2005/06 to over 70m. passengers in 2011/12.
        "Ryanair's partnership with Boeing has been central to our successful
         growth as the lowest fare and lowest cost airline in Europe. Today's
         order for 140 additional aircraft (70 firm units) gives Ryanair access
         to lower aircraft costs, which in turn reduces operating costs and
         reinforces our determination to drive air fares in Europe even lower.
         "Ryanair is presently Europe's largest low fares airline, and thanks to
         our successful partnership with Boeing, we intend to become Europe's
         largest airline (by passenger traffic). We will do so by using the best
         shorthaul aircraft in the business - the Boeing 737-800, by offering
         even lower fares to our passengers and by creating over 2,500 new highly
         paid jobs in existing and new bases all over Europe".
Ends.                    Thursday, 24th February

                      RECORD BOOKINGS ON NEW DUBLIN ROUTES
                YET BERTIE CONTINUES TO DITHER ON SECOND TERMINAL
                    RESULTING IN EUR750 MILLION OF LOST REVENUE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 2nd February 2005)
announced record bookings on its 6 new Dublin routes that went on sale just last
week. Over 26,000 passengers across Europe have already booked seats with fares
from only EUR4.99 on Ryanair's new routes from Carcassonne, Biarritz, Rome,
Doncaster, Frankfurt and Eindhoven to Dublin. The routes, commencing in April
are scheduled to carry 500,000 passengers per annum and will create 500 new
jobs.
Speaking this morning, Peter Sherrard, Ryanair's Head of Communications, said:
        "The huge response from European visitors to the launch of Ryanair's new
         routes is just a dip in the ocean when compared to the 5 million
         passengers which Ryanair could carry to and from Dublin if there was a
         Second Competing Terminal.
        "Government indecision on a Second Competing Terminal at Dublin is going
Ryanair Holdings PLC Record Bookings new Dubroutes
         to cost Irish Tourism annually at least 3 million potential visitors,
         and EUR750 million in lost revenue to the Irish Economy. Demand from
         Europe to Ireland is huge, but it is a very cost conscious environment
         and Irish tourism will only grow with a low cost terminal offering low
         fare routes.
        "Low fares and competition at Dublin will deliver 5,000 new jobs in
         tourism - Government dithering is halting tourism growth - Why are we
         still waiting?"

 Introduction
 For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
 adjusted profit and loss account excluding the exceptional costs and goodwill
 referred to below.
Exceptional costs in the quarter ended December 31, 2003 consisted of EUR5.5m in
lease costs and additional depreciation of EUR0.6m arising from the earlier than
planned retirement of a sixth aircraft necessitated by the 'scribing' of these
aircraft (Note 4). Goodwill of EUR0.5m was amortised in the quarter compared to
EUR0.6m in the quarter ended December 31, 2003.
Profit after tax decreased by 16% to EUR34.5m during the quarter compared to the

        "Since 1998, Ryanair has slashed the cost of air travel for millions of
         ordinary Italians making flying affordable for all. In 2005, Ryanair
         will carry 10 m pax on 66 Italian routes sustaining 10,000 jobs in

                          RYANAIR BEATS ITS EXPECTATIONS.
                  Q3 NET PROFIT OF EUR35m - TRAFFIC GROWS 13% TO 6.9M
    Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Monday, 31st January 2005)
     announced a Net Profit after tax of EUR35.0m for the 3rd Quarter ended 31 Dec
     2004. Passenger volumes grew by 13% to 6.9m whilst yields were in line with
     the same Quarter last year, and as a result, total revenues rose by 15% to
     EUR294.4m. Unit costs rose by 26% due to the increase in the level of activity
     and in particular higher fuel and route charges. During the Quarter,
     maintenance provisions of EUR4.5m (net of tax) were released to the profit and
     loss due to the earlier than scheduled return of 6 leased 737-300's. As a
     result Q3 net profit declined by 26% and the Q3 profit margin after tax
     declined by 7 points to 12%.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results
     goodwill charge of EUR0.6m in 2003 and EUR0.5m in 2004.
    Announcing these results Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
    "These quarterly results are a testimony to the strength of the Ryanair
     "lowest cost" model which - even during the most difficult trading
     conditions (including record fuel prices and intense competition) - delivers
     strong passenger growth and profits. We continue, like Southwest, to
     maintain our record of 31 consecutive quarters of unbroken profitability
     (before exceptionals) since we floated in May 1997.
    "As predicted, casualties continue in the European industry, most notably
     Volare, VBird and Air Polonia. Hapag Lloyd Express, MyTravel Lite and Basiq
     Air have announced significant reversals of capacity back into their charter
     operations, while many of Europe's flag carriers (most notably Alitalia and
     SAS) have announced record losses. This is not a temporary phenomenon
     resulting from high oil prices, but a permanent market shift towards low
     cost air travel, led by Ryanair. Only the lowest cost airlines like
     Southwest in the US and Ryanair in Europe will prosper over the medium term
     and we expect further casualties, cut backs and withdrawals among our loss
     making competitors.
    "Despite intense competition, yields were similar to those achieved last
     year and better than our previous guidance of a decline of between 5% to
     10%. We believe this is due to capacity removals by competitors and the
     continuing impact of multiple fuel surcharges imposed by many of our high
     fare competitors, which have made Ryanair's low fares even more attractive
     to European consumers.
    "Fuel prices remain high and will continue to impact our future guidance.
     Our fuel hedges expired at the end of October 2004 and we were unhedged
     during November, however as forward prices fell, we restarted our hedging
     programme for this Winter season. We are almost 100% hedged at an average of
     $41 per barrel for Brent crude for the 4th Quarter and are unhedged
     thereafter. Lower than expected fuel prices also had a positive impact on
     our Quarter 3 results when fuel costs were EUR4m better than our previous
     guidance. We expect our Q4 fuel costs to be EUR5m lower than the previous
     guidance. We still see value in hedging to remove uncertainty from our
     business and will continue to review our hedging policy as forward oil
     prices return to more "normal" levels.
    "Advance bookings for Q4 indicate that traffic growth is in line with
     expectations. With some 50% of the seats sold (and assuming no adverse
     movement in exchange rates) we expect yields may now rise by up to 5% for
     the Quarter. We would caution investors that this upturn in yield is more a
     reflection of the precipitous 22% decline in the comparable Q4 yields last
     year, slower capacity growth and an earlier Easter, rather than some
     significant current price recovery. As we review Q4 of last year, it appears
     to have been an exceptional result with yields collapsing due to the
     combined effect of the war in Iraq, the threat of terrorism, high oil
     prices, our own enormous capacity growth (+50%) and the market entry of many
     irrational low fare (but not low cost) airlines in Europe, many of whom have
     disappeared as quickly as they entered.
    "Ryanair continues to grow strongly and profitably in spite of adverse
     market conditions. The airline is now carrying 74% more traffic than it did
     just two years ago (in Q3 of 2002). Ryanair is the No.1 or No.2 airline in
     terms of market share in over 90% of our markets and we continue to maintain
     world record profit margins despite significantly higher oil prices and
     route charges. Our new bases in Luton, Liverpool and Shannon are booking
     well for 2005, and we believe that our 21 new Spanish routes will also
     perform strongly, particularly during the Summer months. We have (last week)
     announced six new routes from Dublin to Biarritz and Carcassonne in France,
     Frankfurt in Germany, Eindhoven in Holland, Doncaster in the UK and Rome in
     Italy as a foretaste of what is on offer from Dublin if we get a second
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results
     competing terminal. Once again, we strongly urge the Taoiseach to press
     ahead with the second terminal at Dublin airport. In addition, this morning
     Ryanair will unveil its first 3 Italian domestic routes. The destinations
     and fares will be announced at a press conference in Rome, which will herald
     the end of Alitalia's domestic high fare monopoly in Italy.
    "We support the development of a second runway at Stansted Airport, but are
     united with all other Stansted users in opposing the GBP4bn. folly being
     advocated by the BAA. The fact that price sensitive consumers are being
     asked to cross subsidise almost GBP2bn. worth of unnecessary rail links and
     motorways demonstrates how completely out of touch the BAA airport monopoly
     has become. Ryanair and other Stansted users support the type of low cost,
     second terminal and runway facilities developed by Manchester at a cost of
     some GBP400m. But only a regulated monopoly like the BAA could possibly
     propose spending ten times this sum on gold plating facilities that our
     passengers neither need nor want. We call on the UK Government to break up
     the BAA airport monopoly, which is now the world's most profitable airport
     operator, because passengers need competition between the London airports if
     British consumers and visitors are to continue to enjoy the lowest cost air
     travel in Europe.
    "The initial trial of our inflight entertainment system has been
     disappointing. Whilst the trial period was hampered by the lack of content
     in non-English languages, the uptake among passengers has been lower than
     expected. We have now resolved these service issues with the content
     provider, but unless we see a significant improvement in customer take up,
     we will not roll out the system across the entire fleet as planned. We
     remain believers in the potential of inflight entertainment however, as
     initially with CD's and the IPod, it may take some time for the travelling
     public in Europe to catch on to the technology. Should we decide to
     discontinue with IFE at the end of our extended trial period, Ryanair will
     suffer no financial loss whatsoever.
    "We continue our cautious outlook for Quarter 4 and the full year outturn.
     Whilst yields and fuel prices are now somewhat better than originally
     forecast, Sterling has weakened appreciably and this will have a downward
     impact on yields. In Quarter 4 last year we suffered a 22% collapse in
     average fares, however based on current booking trends we now expect that Q4
     yields this year might be as much as 5% higher than last year. Despite
     higher route and fuel charges, we continue to deliver the highest net
     margins in the industry and we therefore believe that Ryanair's lowest cost
     model will continue to grow and prosper across Europe to the benefit of our
     passengers, people and our shareholders".

The strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a positive impact on both the
depreciation and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 46% to EUR186.2m due to a 21% increase in the number of hours
flown, a significant increase in the average US$ cost per gallon of fuel partly
offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US$ during
the period.
Maintenance costs decreased by 12% to EUR27.2m reflecting an increase in the size
of the fleet operated, and an increase in the number of hours flown offset by
maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from the higher
proportion of 737-800 operated. Four BAE 146 aircraft, which incurred higher
maintenance charges per aircraft operated compared to the remainder of the
fleet, were returned to KLM earlier this year. During the last quarter, six
leased 737-300 aircraft were returned earlier than scheduled, which in turn
enabled the company to release maintenance overhaul provisions of EUR5.2m.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 22% to EUR13.4m due to higher spend
on promoting new routes and an increase in the level of activity during the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -5-
period.
Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR17.2m to EUR23.6m reflecting the increased
costs associated with the lease of thirteen 737-800 aircraft since December
31,2003 offset by the return to KLM of four BAE 146 aircraft earlier this year.
Six leased 737-300 aircraft were also returned to the lessor during quarter the
3rd quarter.
Route charges increased by 26% to EUR101.3m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length, an increase in the
weight of the aircraft operated, (which incur a higher charge), and the negative
impact of the strengthening of sterling against the Euro during the period.
Airport and handling charges increased by 22% to EUR134.6m, slightly more than the
increase in passenger volumes due to increased costs at certain existing
airports offset by lower costs at new airports, and the adverse impact of the
strength of the sterling exchange rate against the euro during the period.
Other expenses increased by 19% to EUR69.9m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 3% to 28% for the period reflecting the
substantial higher fuel prices increased and due to the reasons outlined above
operating profits increased by 8% to EUR284.2m.
Interest receivable has increased by 14% to EUR20.2m due to an increase in the
level of cash and liquid resources and an improvement in deposit interest rates
earned during the period compared to last year. Interest payable increased by
EUR5.7m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the purchase of new aircraft
during the period.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the growth in profits
during the period. Capital expenditure amounted to EUR342.2m part funded by cash
generated from operating activities, whilst the excess cash of EUR190.5m is
reflected in the increase in cash and liquid resources to EUR1,447.9m at 31
December 2004. Long term Debt, net of repayments increased by EUR200.4m, which was
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -5-
drawn down to part fund aircraft deliveries during the period.
Shareholders' Funds at December 31, 2004 have increased to EUR1,691.5m compared to
EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.
                       Notes to the Financial Statements
 1. Accounting Policies
     The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these consolidated
     financial statements for the nine months ended December 31, 2004 are
     consistent with those set out in the financial statements for the year ended
     March 31, 2004.
  2. Approval of the Financial Statements
     The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     Nine months ended December 31, 2004 on January 28th, 2005.
  3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
     The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the Quarter and Nine
     months ended December 31, 2004 are based on the results reported under Irish
     and UK GAAP.
  4. Aircraft retirement costs
        Six aircraft were retired earlier than projected in 2003 due to the
         detection of scratch marks ('scribing') that occurred during an aircraft
         painting programme on these aircraft in 1995. It had been determined
         that the cost of repairing these aircraft was uneconomic due to the
         short remaining life of the aircraft. Accordingly the Company had
         determined that the residual value of US$1m(EUR794k) for these aircraft
         was excessive and as a result reduced it to EUR250k per aircraft. The cost
         of this adjustment charge for five aircraft was reflected in the results
         for the quarter ended September 30,2003, and the charge for a sixth
         aircraft is expensed in quarter ended December 31, 2003.

same period last year. The adjusted profit for the quarter, excluding
exceptional costs and goodwill, decreased by 26% to EUR35.0m.
Summary Quarter ended December 31, 2004
Profit after tax decreased by 26% to EUR35.0m, compared to EUR47.5m in the previous
quarter ended Dec 31, 2003. Total operating revenues increased by 15% to
EUR294.4m, which was faster than the 13% growth in passenger volumes, as fares
were almost in line with last year and a continuation of the strong growth in
ancillary revenues. Total revenue per passenger has as a result increased by 2%,
whilst the successful launch of new routes and the slower rate of growth
resulted in load factors increasing from 83% to 84% during the period.
Total operating expenses increased by 26% to EUR245.8m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges and airport
& handling costs associated with the growth of the airline. Fuel, our largest
cost item, increased by 68% due to substantial increases in the US$ cost per
gallon, partially offset by the strengthening of the Euro to the Dollar.
Operating margins declined 7 points to 17%, which in turn resulted in Operating
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -4-
profit decreasing by 19% to EUR48.7m. Excluding fuel costs operating margins would
have remained constant in both quarters. Profit before tax has declined by 25%,
greater than the decline in operating profit due to the higher net interest
charge arising from the increased level of debt, and foreign exchange losses
which arose from the translation of sterling and US$ bank balances to euro at
the period end exchange rates. As a result, Net Margins declined by 7 points to
12% for the reasons outlined above.
Adjusted earnings per share have also declined by 26% to 4.61 cent for the
period.
Balance Sheet
The Company continues to generate strong cashflow from operations and year to
date amounted to EUR346.7m. This cashflow part funded twelve aircraft deliveries
(six in the current quarter), additional aircraft deposits, and the balance
remaining is in turn reflected in the EUR190.5m increase in Cash and Liquid
Resources since March 31, 2004. Capital expenditure amounted to EUR342.2m during
the period whilst Long Term Debt, net of repayments, increased by EUR200.4m.
Shareholders' Funds at Dec 31, 2004 have increased by EUR236.2m to EUR1,691.5m,
compared to March 31, 2004.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended December 31, 2004
Profit after tax, decreased by 26% to EUR35.0m due to fuel costs increasing by 68%
reflecting the higher US$ cost per gallon, which was partially offset by stable
fares and strong growth in passenger volumes. Operating margins, in turn, have
fallen by 7 points to 17% during the quarter, which has resulted in Operating
profit decreasing by EUR11.5m to EUR48.7m compared to quarter ended December 31,
2003.
Total operating revenues increased by 15% to EUR294.4m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 13% to 6.9m. Total revenue per passenger has increased by 2% in the
quarter due to a combination of higher average fares and strong ancillary
revenue growth.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 14% to EUR246.7m due to a combination of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -4-
a 1% improvement in average fares, increased passenger volumes on existing
routes, and the success of new bases at Rome-Ciampino and Barcelona-Girona. The
slower growth in seat capacity is also reflected in improved load factors, which
rose by 1% to 84% in the quarter.
Ancillary revenues increased 24% to EUR47.7m, a faster rate of growth than
passenger volumes, reflecting a strong performance in non-flight scheduled
revenues, car hire and other ancillary products. Ancillary revenues now account
for 16% of total revenues compared to 15% for the same period last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 26% to EUR245.8m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route
charges, and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of the
airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by a 9% increase in
the average sector length whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partly offset by
the strength of the euro exchange rate against the US$.
Staff costs have increased by 18% to EUR34.8m primarily due to a 13% increase in
average employee numbers to 2,671 and the impact of pay increases of 3% granted
during the period.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 4% to EUR26.1m. Depreciation charges
increased due to an increase in the size of the 737-800 fleet from 41 to 53
('owned' fleet rose from 61 to 64), offset by lower amortisation charges due to
the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the positive impact of a new engine
maintenance agreement on the cost of amortisation of 737-800 aircraft. The
strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a positive impact on the depreciation
and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 68% to EUR72.5m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, a 9% increase in the average sector length, and a significantly higher
average US$ cost per gallon of fuel partially offset by the positive impact of
the strengthening of the Euro to the US dollar during the period. Fuel costs
were also positively impacted by the recommencement of the Company's hedging
strategy for December and lower than expected fuel prices which resulted in a
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -4-
saving of EUR4m.
Maintenance costs decreased by 74% to EUR2.3m reflecting the improved reliability
arising from the higher proportion of 737-800's operated and a lower level of
maintenance costs incurred due to the return of four BAE 146 aircraft to KLM and
the release of maintenance overhaul provisions of EUR5.2m during the quarter
associated with the earlier than scheduled return of six leased 737-300's.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by EUR1.5m to EUR2.6m due to increases in
expenditure arising from the higher level of activity during the quarter.
Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR4.7m to EUR7.4m reflecting the increased costs
arising from the lease of thirteen 737-800 aircraft, of which three were
delivered in the current quarter, offset by the return of four BAE 146s to KLM
earlier in the year and the return of six leased 737-800 aircraft during the
period.
Route charges increased by 22% to EUR33.4m due to an increase in the number
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in the
weight of the aircraft operated (which incur a higher charge).
Airport and handling charges increased by 16% to EUR44.2m, faster than the
increase in passenger volumes due to increased costs at certain existing
airports offset by lower costs at new airports, and the adverse impact of the
strength of the sterling exchange rate against the euro during the period.
Other expenses increased by 18% to EUR22.4m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have declined by 7 points to 17%. Due to the reasons outlined
above operating profits decreased by EUR11.5m to EUR48.7m during the quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR2.3m due to the combined impact of higher
levels of cash and liquid resources and an improvement in average deposit
interest rates earned in the quarter compared to last year. Interest payable
increased by 2.6m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the purchase of new
aircraft.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -4-
Detailed Discussion and Analysis for Nine months ended December 31, 2004
Profit after tax, increased by 6% to EUR236.3m driven by strong growth in
passenger volumes, whilst revenues per passenger were unchanged. This was offset
by higher costs specifically fuel (our largest cost item) which increased by
46%. Operating profit increased by EUR20.8m to EUR284.2m compared to the nine months
ended December 31, 2003 despite Operating margins declining by 3 points to 28%
during the period.
Total operating revenues increased by 19% to EUR1,015.5m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 20% to 20.9m. Total revenue per passenger was unchanged compared
with the same period last year.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 17% to EUR864.4m due to a combination of
increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Rome-Ciampino and Barcelona-Girona, and the commencement of 20 new
routes during the period, partly offset by a 2% reduction in average fares. The
strong growth in passenger volumes is also reflected in the improvement in the
load factor achieved, which rose from 83% to 86% during the period.
Ancillary revenues continue to perform strongly with revenues growing by 36% to
EUR151.2m in the period. This performance reflects the strong growth in non-flight
scheduled revenues, car hire and other ancillary products. Ancillary revenues
continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and now account for 15%
of total revenues compared to 13% last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR731.3m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route
charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of the
airline. The increase in total operating expenses was also due to the
strengthening of the Sterling to Euro exchange rate partly offset by a stronger
Euro to US$ exchange rate.
Staff costs have increased by 14% to EUR104.1m. This increase primarily reflects a
13% increase in average employee numbers to 2,578 and the impact of 3% pay
increases granted during the period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 3rd Quarter Results -4-
Depreciation and amortisation declined by 1% to EUR71.0m. An additional twelve
737-800 aircraft were purchased during the period, however during the same
period the company retired 10 737-200 aircraft. The resultant higher
depreciation charge was offset by a combination of a lower amortisation charge
due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the positive impact of a new
engine maintenance agreement on the cost of amortisation of 737-800 aircraft.

have been restated by GBP20m in respect of the change in the revenue accounting
policy in the fourth quarter of 2003/04 on adoption of Financial Reporting
Standard 5 Application Note G.
2. BAA and Ryanair have issued counter writs in respect of the non payment of
airport charges and claims that the fuel levy charged by BAA to the fuel
companies is excessive and unlawful respectively. As a result of the non
payment of airport charges, BAA considers that Ryanair has repudiated its
existing agreements. This has resulted in Ryanair being invoiced an additional
GBP14m of airport charges since July. Ryanair has refused to pay these additional
charges. Although BAA is confident of winning the dispute, given the current
litigation a GBP14m provision at 31December 2004 has been established.

closed.
5. The interest charge is shown net of capitalised interest in respect of the
Group of GBP55m (31 December 2003: GBP62m; 31 March 2004: GBP85m), including GBP58m (31
December 2003: GBP43m; 31 March 2004 GBP62m) in respect of Terminal 5, of which GBP5m
relates to the unwinding of the discount on provisions. FRS 17 other finance
income is GBP8m (31December 2003: GBP1m; 31 March 2004: GBP1m).
6. The taxation charge for the nine months ended 31 December 2004 has been
based on the estimated effective rate for the full year before exceptional

7. The Group's investment properties are included at 31 March 2004 valuations
as adjusted for additions and disposals since that date.
8. Airport fixed assets in the course of construction (excluding capitalised
interest and unwinding of the discount rate on the purchase of the Terminal 5
Thames Water land) include GBP2,174m (31 December 2003: GBP1,410m; 31 March 2004: GBP
1,589m) in respect of Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport. This includes GBP181m (31
December 2003: GBP191m, 31 March 2004: GBP189m) for the acquisition of land for the
construction of Terminal 5. The operational assets employed by the vendor of
this land have been relocated and the acquisition cost represents the present
value of the estimated deferred payments to be made over 35 years to the vendor
in compensation for relocation.
Airport fixed assets in the course of construction also include GBP26m in respect
of costs, incurred in connection with the initial planning application
preparation (GBP9m) and purchase of domestic properties that fall within the

main pension scheme of GBP95m (31 December 2003: GBP109m; 31 March 2004: GBP98m) and
provision for unfunded pension obligations and post retirement medical benefits
BAA PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
of GBP13m (31 December: GBP12m; 31 March 2004: GBP13m). All amounts are net of
deferred tax.
11. Holders of US$109m of Loan Notes of World Duty Free Americas, Inc. (now
known as DFA Inc.), sold by BAA in October 2001, issued proceedings against BAA
plc, World Duty Free plc and the purchaser of WDFA Inc. in May 2002, for $109m
and punitive damages, claiming the defendants had fraudulently conveyed the
assets of WDFA Inc. A trial in December 2003 found BAA plc and World Duty Free
plc not liable to the bond holders on all counts. An appeal by the bond holders
was held in November 2004 and a decision is expected in early 2005. BAA is
confident that it will be successful in opposing the appeal or, again,
succeeding in the unlikely event of a further trial being ordered.

              RYANAIR ANNOUNCES SIX NEW ROUTES - EUROPE TO DUBLIN
          BIARRITZ, CARCASSONNE, DONCASTER, EINDHOVEN, FRANKFURT & ROME
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 26th January 2005)
announced that it will launch 6 new routes from Europe to Dublin this Summer
with fares a fraction of the price of Aer Lingus' lowest each way fare.
ROUTE                              START DATE                FARE*
Biarritz                           19th April 05            EUR 29.99
 Carcassonne                        19th April 05            EUR 29.99
 Rome                               19th April 05            EUR 29.99
 Eindhoven                          19th April 05            EUR 19.99
 Doncaster Sheffield                28th April 05            EUR 4.99
 Frankfurt                           3rd May 05              EUR 19.99
*One way tax inclusive
Announcing Ryanair's six new routes in Dublin today, Ryanair's Deputy Chief
Executive, Michael Cawley, said:
        "These six new routes from Europe to Dublin are great news for Irish
         consumers, Irish tourism, and Irish jobs. By launching low fare flights
         to Germany, Italy and the South of France, Ryanair will make Europe
Ryanair Holdings PLC 6 New routes Europe to Dublin
         affordable for Irish consumers at fares that are less than half the
         price of Aer Lingus' so called lowest prices.
        "We also expect that more than half of the traffic on these new routes
         will be European visitors, who will no longer be deterred by Aer Lingus'
         high fares. Ryanair will use its large marketing presence in these
         overseas markets to drum up business for Irish tourism.
        "Ryanair expects to carry over 500,000 passengers per annum on these six
         routes, this will create over 500 new jobs here at Dublin Airport. These
         new links show what can be done if Bertie Ahern would honour his
         election promise and deliver a competing second terminal instead of
         three years of dithering. A competing second terminal would bring 5
         million new passengers per annum and create 5,000 jobs, these routes
         today are just a taste of what's possible if only decision would replace
         dithering as the tourism policy of Bertie Ahern's Government."

               RYANAIR REDUCES PLANNED EXPANSION AT MILAN BERGAMO
                   DUE TO CONTRACTUAL DISAGREEMENT WITH AIRPORT
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Friday, 14th January 2005)
announced the cancellation of 3 frequencies across a number of its routes from
Milan Bergamo, due to a contractual disagreement with the airport. The airline
confirmed that it will not be expanding its base to a fifth aircraft as
originally announced in November.
Announcing the reduction in planned services from Milan Bergamo, Ryanair's
Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley, said in Dublin:
        "When we announced our planned expansion from our Milan Bergamo base
         late last year the terms negotiated were clear - Ryanair would achieve
         further cost savings and an expansion of the term of its contract in
         return for a 60% increase in its presence at the airport and an increase
         in passenger numbers through the airport of over 1 million per annum.
         Unfortunately the airport feels that it cannot now honour one term of
         the agreement and regrettably we have decided to cancel part of our
         expansion which involves a reduction in frequency on three routes -
         Milan - London Stansted, Milan - Brussels Charleroi and Milan -
Ryanair Holdings PLC Milan Frequency Reductions
         Frankfurt Hahn with effect from 25th February 2005. All other services
         at Milan Bergamo will be unaffected by this decision. Passengers on the
         cancelled flights will be offered alternatives on the same route.
         "Ryanair will be announcing within the next week where this aircraft
         will now be positioned. All our growth and cost projections for fiscal
         2005/2006 remain unaffected".
Ends.                               Friday, 14th January 2005

                    RYANAIR'S LOW FARES ARRIVE IN SANTIAGO!
                           NEW ROUTE TO LONDON STANSTED
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 11th January 2005)
announced a new direct route from Santiago De Compostela to London Stansted. The
new route will commence on 11th April 2005 and will operate daily with fares
starting from just EUR2.99*
Announcing the new route today, Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said:
        "For the first time the people of Galicia can enjoy Ryanair's low fares
         revolution! When it comes to low fares in Europe Ryanair is No 1. Other
         airlines pretend to be low fares but when it comes to low fares Ryanair
         leaves the others in our slipstream. Our new route commences on 11th
         April 2005 with fares starting from just EUR2.99*!
        "This new low fares route is good news for consumers and good news for
         Galicia. Ryanair will carry 100,000 passengers on its 1st year on this
         new low fares route and will deliver 75,000 visitors to Santiago and
         wider Galicia. This translates to the direct creation of 100 jobs for
         the region and savings of EUR10 M for these consumers over the high fares
         airlines".

BAA announces November traffic figures
BAA's seven UK airports handled a total of 10.2 million passengers in November,
an increase of 3.0% over the same month last year.
All BAA's airports recorded increased traffic in November. Aberdeen grew 10.9%,
Southampton 9.9%, Glasgow 5.6% and Edinburgh 4.5%. Gatwick's traffic increased
4.6% reflecting healthy growth in scheduled markets which offset a significant
decline in charter traffic. Heathrow's growth of 1.2% reflected the impact on
the North Atlantic traffic of the US Presidential election and Thanksgiving and
more generally by fuel surcharges and the reduction in BA's schedule.
Stansted's 4.2% growth was slower than in previous months. While EasyJet and
other airlines continued to enjoy good growth at Stansted in November,
Ryanair's traffic growth was low. Ryanair is operating its 2004 winter
schedule, which started at the end of October, with a net loss of one route
compared with its 2003 schedule.
Among the key markets other long haul (non-North Atlantic) traffic grew 9.9%,
domestic 4.7% and European scheduled traffic increased 3.2%. The European
BAA PLC November 2004 Traffic Figures
charter market declined 13.4%, though this was accentuated by a sharp drop of
23% at BAA's Scottish Airports where a number of leisure destinations have been
technically reclassified as scheduled. The underlying decline in the European
charter market was 8%. The North Atlantic market was 1.2% down on 2003.
In total, BAA's airports recorded an increase of 3.2% in air transport
movements during the month while cargo tonnage grew 2.3%.
BAA's guidance for the year of over 6% traffic growth remains unchanged.

                   HIGH FARE AIRLINES ARE STILL PROFITEERING
                     FROM FUEL SURCHARGES AS FUEL PRICES FALL
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 9th December 2004)
criticised Europe's high fares airlines for continuing to price gouge consumers
with ridiculous fuel surcharges, even though oil prices have fallen by over 30%
to less than $40 per barrel in recent weeks.

Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "When fuel prices started to increase last year, BA, Air France, KLM and
         Lufthansa were very quick to penalise consumers through extortionate
Ryanair Holdings PLC Fuel Surcharges Press Release
         fuel surcharges. Not content with just one fuel surcharge, airlines like
         BA have introduced THREE separate fuel surcharge increases to
         passengers.
        "Fuel prices have now reduced by 30%, and still this profiteering by
         high fares airlines continues.
        "Consumers can rest assured that Ryanair, which GUARANTEED to never
         introduce fuel surcharges, is committed to lowering fares to consumers,
         not increasing them. It is no wonder millions of consumers are choosing
         Ryanair because only Ryanair offers passengers Europe's lowest fares,
         unbeatable punctuality and customer service and GUARANTEED no fuel
         surcharges. It is time these already high fares airlines stop
         profiteering from fuel surcharges".

                                  VOLARE PILOTS
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 2nd December 2004)
announced that by midnight tonight, over 30,000 ex-Volare passengers, stranded
after the airline's collapse, will have taken up Ryanair's offer of FREE tickets

next week for Volare Pilots. The recruitment open day will be held on Thursday

Commenting on today's announcements, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul

        "Even before the unfortunate but inevitable collapse of Volare, Ryanair
         was Italy's second largest airline. Our offer of free flights for
Ryanair Holdings PLC Rescues 30K Volare Passengers
         stranded Volare passengers (which ends tonight at midnight) will result
         in over 30,000 Volare passengers being re-united with family and friends
         by travelling with Ryanair for free*, after losing the air fare paid to
         Volare. We warmly welcome our new passengers, and they can be assured
         that by flying with Ryanair, they are flying with Europe's No.1 low
         fares airline.
        "As well as saving thousands of stranded Volare passengers, Ryanair is
         also concentrating on saving lost Volare jobs. We will be hosting a
         Recruitment Open Day for out of work Volare pilots next week in Venice,
         Volare's home base city. The Open Day will give Volare pilots the
         opportunity to talk to Ryanair about working for Europe's No. 1 low
         fares airline, and Europe's No. 1 earnings airline. We expect a strong
         turnout from Volare pilots anxious to secure a long-term future with
         Ryanair".
* Free flight = EUR zero fare but the passenger pays any relevant Government taxes
and airport charges.

Ryanair will allocate up to four Boeing 737-800 series aircraft to Shannon, and
will operate a network of 14 low fare scheduled routes to the UK and Continental
Europe. Ryanair has guaranteed to deliver 1.3 million passengers in the first
year of this base, rising to 2 million passengers by year 5.
According to ACI figures, these 2m p.a. passengers will generate 2,000 new jobs
in the Shannon region, with the first 200 of these being direct Ryanair
employees (pilots, cabin crew, engineers etc) whose recruitment will begin
immediately.
The routes announced by Ryanair from Shannon include 6 UK destinations as well
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY Invest $240m in Shannon
as 8 European destinations, and all the new routes are launched at fares that
are at least half the price of the high fares presently charged by Aer Lingus
(or their equivalent) on European routes from Cork and Dublin. Shannon Airport
will now become the low fares airport of Ireland.

 *Existing Route
Announcing this $240m base in Shannon, Ryanair's CEO, Michael O'Leary, said:
        "This base revolutionises the future growth of Shannon Airport. It would
         not have been possible without the vision and tenacity of the new
         Shannon Airport Authority led by Chairman, Mr Pat Shanahan. In less than
         two months since their appointment, the Board of Shannon has won this
         biggest ever single investment in Irish tourism, despite intense
         competition from seven other low cost European Airports. Had the
         contract not been signed last week, these aircraft would have gone
         instead to Italy to take up opportunities created by the collapse of
         Volare. Instead Ryanair will invest $240 million in Shannon in the next
         12 months and we have guaranteed to deliver 2 million passengers p.a.
         within 5 years which is double Shannon's existing traffic. This new
         traffic will lead to the creation of 2,000 new jobs here in the Shannon
         region.
        "Today's announcement vindicates the policy of former Minister for
         Transport, Seamus Brennan, TD and the Government to break up the Aer
         Rianta monopoly and allow Cork and Shannon Airports the freedom to
         compete with Dublin. This new base will make Shannon Airport the low
         cost gateway to Ireland and promote tourism access to Ireland's western
         seaboard for UK and European visitors. We will use Ryanair's enormous
         presence in Continental Europe to attract hundreds of thousands of
         visitors to the West of Ireland on a year round basis. We look forward
         to working closely with Tourism Ireland and the industry here in the
         Mid-West to ensure that these visitors keep coming again and again.
        "This new base means that passengers using Shannon Airport will now
         enjoy air fares that are at least half the price of Aer Lingus (and
         others) lowest air fares from Dublin and Cork to Europe. Dubliners will
         now be forced to drive to Shannon for low fare access to Europe which
         again shows the pressing need for Bertie Ahern's Government make a
         decision on a competing second terminal at Dublin Airport. The new Board
         at Shannon Airport have shown that enormous tourism and job growth is
         possible if decisions are taken quickly. We call yet again on the
         Taoiseach to put the interests of Irish consumers and tourism first, and
         allow a competing second terminal to be built at Dublin Airport as a
         matter of utmost urgency".

Body
Dawson News continues to play a leading part in industry discussions with the
wholesalers' trade body, the Association of Newspaper and Magazine Wholesalers
("ANMW"), and the Joint Industry Group ("JIG"). We are also actively working
with newspaper and magazine publishers to develop the case to the Office of Fair
Trading ("OFT") for suitable measures to be introduced for the newspaper and
magazine industry following the repeal of the Vertical Agreement Exemption Order
in May 2005. We are confident that any changes will not disrupt the current
highly time sensitive supply chain which supports the universal service
obligation upon wholesalers and provides a low cost route to market and the
public for a wide range of publishers.
Dawson Media Direct
Dawson Media Direct continues on the strategy towards providing a comprehensive
pan-European service to airlines and publishers recording a turnover increase of
9% over the previous year.
The provision of newspapers to British Airways passengers at departure gates has
now been extended to 91 locations throughout Europe and feedback from British
Dawson Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
Airways and their passengers has been very positive.
In line with our strategy of developing centres of operating excellence in key
European hub airports, we acquired Newspaper Gate Service in Frankfurt on 1st
October, 2004. This operation, which will be renamed Dawson Media Direct GmbH,
provides inflight newspapers and magazines to 40 airlines operating from
Frankfurt and provides a sound base from which to develop the extensive German
market.
Our business in Brussels, Dawson Media Direct NV, continues to supply the
substantial majority of airlines operating into and out of Brussels and has
implemented the renewed SN Brussels Airlines business very successfully.
Our attempts to develop onboard sales of magazines in the low cost, no frills
market has proved frustrating. Our trial with Ryanair during the year has been
discontinued due to disappointingly low passenger take up. We continue to
examine opportunities for development with this substantial market as we roll
out our presence across Europe.
Direct News Delivery has been successful in renewing its agreement with Mirror
Group Newspapers for the supply of the Racing Post to licensed bookmakers in the
Greater London area. This, together with the relocation of the administrative
function into the Dawson Media Direct Langley head office, gives us a sound base
for development of this business.
Dawson Marketing Services
During 2004 the business has continued to focus on achieving a year-on-year
reduction in losses by tightly managing the cost base associated with Travel
Brochures, and delivering new business in the general Direct Marketing aspect of
the division.
Travel Brochure volumes reached the anticipated levels, but continuing price
pressure means an already difficult niche market has little opportunity to offer
growth in the foreseeable future. The weighting of travel brochure distribution
within the overall mix is such that turnover for the division as a whole fell by
1% in the year.
Dawson Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
Against this difficult situation we have ensured that Dawson Distribution
continues to grow. This business stream organises the distribution on behalf of
the division and wherever possible fully utilises the resources of Dawson News.
It also carries out third party distribution activities and through contract
re-negotiation and growth of existing clients its contribution has grown
year-on-year.
Our Direct Marketing activity which represents half the divisional turnover has
grown as we continue to build on the success of the last few years. Business
wins include high volume data capture for a Partwork Publisher, point of sale
handling for a major Off Licence chain and literature fulfilment for a number of
major UK attractions.
Dawson Books
Dawson Books has made steady progress against a backdrop of uncertain academic
economics, pressure on book budgets and a strengthening Pound. Our continued
strategic focus on high quality service has helped Dawson Books achieve record
levels in both revenues and earnings.
The year has seen Dawson Books consolidate its position within the academic
market further despite determined competition. Service standards have helped
secure extensions to existing tenders and win important re-tenders. Successful
tendering to supply the Southern Universities Purchasing Consortium (SUPC), the
Scottish Universities, and the addition of European publications to the North
East and Yorkshire Academic Libraries (NEYAL) contract, has provided the
opportunity to deepen market penetration and increase UK market share. Winning
so comprehensively is not only a vote of confidence in the Dawson service and
the Dawson team but sets a solid platform for growth in the coming year.
The addition of eBooks to our Total Book Management portfolio through our
partnership with eBooks Corporation will further enhance our standing with
library customers as we respond to their increasingly complex requirements. Our
continuing commitment to investment in infrastructure and systems reinforces our
link with libraries and encourages the relationship to flourish.
Dawson Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
The strong Pound and aggressive competition have made growth in export markets a
challenge. Our continental European operations performed to expectations. Dawson
France, in particular, has benefited from the re-tender exercise instituted
across the academic market following the introduction of new laws governing the
acquisition of books by libraries.
Progress has been made by our North American company despite depressed market
conditions. New management has reinvigorated the sales process and this will
produce growth in the coming year.
Operating & Financial Review
Group Strategy
The agreed strategy put in place four years ago has been successfully followed
throughout the year. It is:
   to continue to invest in the Dawson News wholesale business,
   to increase the range of products utilising the distribution network by
     building on marketing support services at Dawson Marketing Services,
   to expand and enhance the services to the travelling public via our
     Dawson Media Direct division, and
   to continue investment for growth in Dawson Books.
Group Performance
Turnover
Reported turnover increased 5.3% to GBP695.3m (2003 - GBP660.6m). If the prior
period was restated to include tabloid newspapers at usual rather than the then
heavily discounted cover prices the reported increase would have been 4.4% which
is more indicative of underlying trends.
Profit
Operating profit grew 16% to GBP16.1m (2003 - GBP13.9m). All divisions showed
improved performance. Profit before tax and exceptional items grew 21% to
GBP14.7m (2003 - GBP12.1m).
Exceptional Item
Towards the end of year the group realised an exceptional profit of GBP1.5m on the
disposal of an investment property for the sum of GBP2.2m. The carrying value was
GBP0.7m (inclusive of a revaluation reserve of GBP0.4m). Capital losses brought
Dawson Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
forward mean there is no tax chargeable on this disposal. There were no
exceptional items in the previous year.
Interest
Strong cash flow once again led to a reduction in interest charges from GBP2.2m to
GBP1.7m. Net interest was covered 9.7 times by profits before the exceptional
profit on the disposal of an investment property.
Tax
Tax has been charged at an effective rate of 30% (2003 - 35%) on reported pre
tax profits that include the exceptional item and goodwill amortisation, neither
of which actually affects taxable profit. Excluding these items the underlying
rate of tax was 31% (2003 - 32%). This is slightly above the standard UK 30%
corporate tax rate because there are always non-deductible expenses.
Shareholder Return
Earnings per share increased by 26% to 14.9p from 11.8p before the exceptional
profit. This follows 31% and 20% increases in the previous two years. The total
dividend for the year is 7.3p, which is a 5.8% increase on the 2003 dividend of
6.9p. Last year the dividend was increased by 4.5%. Dividend cover before
goodwill and exceptional items is 2.2 times (2003 - 1.9 times).
Because goodwill of GBP70.4m had been written off to reserves before the adoption
of FRS 10 (under which goodwill on acquisitions is now capitalised and
subsequently amortised), shareholder reserves on consolidation are GBP10.8m
negative (2003 - GBP17.4m negative).
Capital Expenditure
GBP4.0m (2003 - GBP4.7m) was spent in the year. None of this was financed by leasing
(2003 - GBP0.5m). Of this, GBP3.6m was spent on vehicles, IT and operational
equipment in the News division (2003 - GBP4.0m).
Cash Flow
It has been a strategy of the group to lower its borrowings and once again net
debt at the year-end has been reduced, to GBP9.1m from GBP15.9m at the end of 2003
(2002 - GBP26.7m; 2001 - GBP39.1m). As always, there are significant predictable
Dawson Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
swings within each calendar month of around GBP20m such that year-end positions
are not necessarily representative of the year as a whole. The reduction in the
average underlying debt is evidenced by the lower interest cost of GBP1.7m in 2004
compared with previous years (2003 - GBP2.2m; 2002 - GBP2.7m; 2001 - GBP3.2m).
Interest rates have shown increases in the year but the strong cash flow and
repayments of above average interest rate term loans have more than offset the
rises.
Funding & Liquidity
The group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits and bank
borrowings. In 2001 the group arranged GBP55m of facilities with its UK bankers,
National Westminster and Barclays. This comprised a GBP25m amortising term loan
until 2007, a GBP10m term loan repayable in 2008 and a GBP20m revolving credit
facility. The disposal of investment properties in 2002 and 2004, together with
strong underlying cash flows, have allowed early repayment of GBP10.3m of the term
loans by the period end. This meant the group had access to GBP37.3m (2003 -

                       RYANAIR TO EXPAND ROUTES IN ITALY
                OFFERS FREE FLIGHTS TO STRANDED VOLARE PASSENGERS
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (Wednesday, 24th November 2004)
announced expansion plans in the Italian market to assist the many hundreds of
thousands of passengers disrupted as a result of the collapse of Volare on
Friday evening last.
Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley unveiled these plans at a press
conference in Milan today which comprise:
        1.Ryanair announced a new twice daily service from Paris (Beauvais) to
         Venice (Treviso) which is Ryanair's 65th international route to and from
         Italy and means that Ryanair now flies on nine of the eleven
         international routes previously flown by Volare from Italy to other EU
         destinations. Ryanair is operating most of these routes with greater
         frequency and lower fares than those sold by Volare.
    Volare Routes            Ryanair Routes
     Milan-Barcelona          Milan (Bergamo)-Barcelona (Girona)
     Milan-Paris              Milan (Bergamo)-Paris (Beauvais)

     Venice-Paris             Venice (Treviso)-Paris (Beauvais)
    Bologna-Paris            Venice (Treviso)-Paris (Beauvais)
        2.Ryanair has undertaken to offer free flights* to all passengers,
         booked to travel Volare, on any one of these routes, during the period
         from 1st December to 17th March next (excluding the peak Christmas
         period of 22nd Dec to 4th Jan - when many of Ryanair's flights are
         already sold out). Stranded Volare passengers can make a booking on
         these routes, from today (Wednesday 24th November 04) until
         midnight 2nd Dec 04,subject to availability by accessing
         Ryanair's website at www.ryanair.com, and entering a member
         mode by keying in their Volare  web booking confirmation.
         Passengers will be offered a fare of EUR0 and
         will only be obliged to pay Government taxes and airport charges for
         each of the relevant routes. There are a total of 400,000 seats
         available on these routes, and all bookings of these free flights will
         be on a first come first served basis and are subject to seat
         availability.
*Free flight = EUR zero fare but the passenger pays any relevant Government taxes
and airport charges.
        3.Ryanair has invited all of the Italian airports affected by the
         collapse of Volare to meetings in Milan on Wednesday and Thursday of
         this week to discuss the possibility of Ryanair offering low fare
         domestic flights within Italy on those routes that were previously
         operated by Volare. Ryanair has undertaken that any passengers who have
         lost out as a result of the Volare collapse on domestic routes would be
         offered a similar period of free fares on any domestic routes
         subsequently launched by Ryanair in Italy.
Announcing details of this rescue package for stranded Volare passengers in
Milan today, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Michael Cawley said:
        "Even before the collapse of Volare, Ryanair was already Italy's second
         largest and lowest fares airline. Our comprehensive network of
         international routes to and from Italy with the addition of this new
         Venice-Paris service means that we can offer all international
         passengers stranded by Volare a flight on a similar international route.
         Our offer of free flights (subject only to Government taxes and airport
         charges) will mean that these passengers will have the opportunity of
         travelling on their chosen route without losing the vast majority of the
         air fare paid to Volare, and we look forward to reuniting friends and
         families that may have been stranded by the unfortunate but inevitable
         demise of Volare".
        "Clearly a lot of Italian airports have lost significant traffic volumes
         as a result of Volare's collapse and we have invited all of these
         airports to meetings in Milan this week to see if we can help them to
         launch low fare domestic and international routes, to make up for the
         traffic they have lost as a result of Volare's collapse. Ryanair already
         flies to almost all of the airports in Italy previously served by Volare
         and we expect to announce further route expansion to and from these
         airports in the not too distant future subject to the successful
         conclusion of satisfactory agreements with these airports"
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY to expand routes in Italy
        "The collapse of Volare last week is the second significant collapse
         (V-Bird was the first) in the European low fares sector this Winter.
         Ryanair was the first to predict that there would be a bloodbath this
         Winter which would result in the collapse of loss making low fare
         airlines. With intense competition all over Europe and high oil prices,
         only the strongest low fares airlines will survive Volare will not be
         the last. Many other airlines talk about low fares, but none can match
         Ryanair's low fares, our punctuality or our customer service. We have
         enjoyed enormous growth in the Italian market over the past three years
         and we expect that Ryanair's pro-passenger response to the collapse of
         Volare will enable us to continue to grow and expand in the Italian
         market".

            RYANAIR'S CUSTOMER SERVICE STATISTICS FOR OCTOBER 2004.
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday 23rd November 2004)
released its customer service statistics for October 2004. Ryanair is committed
to publishing customer service statistics each month and these confirm that
Ryanair is also No. 1 for Customer Service.
   92.44% of all Ryanair's 16,179 flights during October arrived on time.

                RYANAIR - $240M INVESTMENT IN NEW LIVERPOOL BASE
                      9 NEW EUROPEAN ROUTES FROM LIVERPOOL
                       TO FRANCE - IRELAND - ITALY - SPAIN
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Monday, 22nd November 2004)
announced it's 12th European base at Liverpool's John Lennon Airport with an
investment of $240M in 4 new Boeing 737-800 series aircraft and 9 NEW European
routes from Liverpool to:
NEW ROUTES:
BARCELONA (REUS)               LIMOGES                  PISA
 CORK                           MURCIA                   SHANNON
 GRANADA                        NIMES                    VENICE
CURRENT ROUTES:
BARCELONA (GIRONA)             DUBLIN        MILAN      ROME
Ryanair, which began services at Liverpool in 1988, already operates 14 daily
international flights from Liverpool to Barcelona (Girona), Dublin, Milan and
Ryanair Holdings PLC InvestmentIn NewLiverpoolBase
Rome. Over the next 12 months Ryanair will carry 1.4M passengers to/from
Liverpool, saving consumers over EUR30M on high fares charged by Easyjet. This new
base announcement and massive increase in routes, destinations and passenger
numbers is also good news for the local economy too, because it will create and
sustain over 1000 new jobs in the Liverpool area.
Also today, Ryanair announced new daily routes from Blackpool to Barcelona and
Pisa to Barcelona. Ryanair already operates two successful routes from Blackpool
to Dublin and London Stansted, and 5 daily routes from Pisa to Brussels,
Glasgow, Hamburg, Frankfurt Hahn and London Stansted.
Announcing Ryanair's 12th European base in Liverpool today, Ryanair's CEO
Michael O'Leary said:
        "Consumers from Merseyside using Liverpool's John Lennon Airport now
         have a real low fares airline offering fares that are almost half the
         price of Easyjet, serving 13 destinations throughout Europe and
         delivering unbeatable punctuality, and that's Ryanair."
        "Our message to Easyjet is simple - You can't match Ryanair's low fares
         and you can't match Ryanair's punctuality and customer service either."
        "These new routes from Liverpool, with fares from an incredible GBP2.99
         (excl. taxes)are available for booking right now, at www.ryanair.com,
         Europe's biggest travel website."
Neil Pakey, Managing Director of Liverpool John Lennon Airport commented:
        "Ryanair's committment is a clear' coming of age' for Liverpool John
         Lennon Airport bringing an additional 1 million passengers through the
         Airport next year. Liverpool is clearly seen by the airline industry as
         a gateway airport for the North of England and in particular for the low
         cost airline market. Ryanair's decision to base four aircraft here will
         bring significant benefits for the North West including around 1000 jobs
         being created in the region's economy."
        "In addition, Liverpool's Capital of Culture status is further enhanced
         as more Europeans will be able to visit Merseyside via convenient direct
         flights and importantly with low fares."

                    RYANAIR CALLS ON GOVERNMENT TO IMPLEMENT
                        COMPETING SECOND TERMINAL AT DUBIN
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline today (Wednesday, 17th November
2004) criticised the Irish Government inaction for over two years since it
received 13 separate expressions of interest to develop a competing second
terminal at Dublin Airport in October 2002. It is NOW time for the Government to
announce the awarding of the Terminal contract.
Speaking today at the First Annual Forum of the Tourism Industry, Ryanair
endorsed the recent criticism of the present Government as a "fudge factory".
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's Chief Executive said:
"It's a joke at our Industry's expense that this Government would host a
Conference on Irish Tourism called "An Agenda for Action". An Agenda for
Inaction would be more appropriate. Our Governments track record of "action" is
Ryanair Holdings PLC Competing2ndTerminal atDublin
as follows:
    -It is 21/2 yearssince this Government was re-elected with a plan to develop
     cost efficient terminal facilities at Dublin Airport ... but nothing has
     happened.
    -It is two yearssince this Government received 13 separate proposals to
     build a competing second terminal at no cost to the tax payer ... and
     nothing's happened.
    -It is one yearsince the Tourism Policy Review Group highlighted the urgent
     need for a competing second terminal at Dublin Airport ... and still
     nothing's happened.
    The Irish tourism industry is in crisis because of this Government's
     inaction".
"Irish tourism is struggling simply because this Government prefers fudge and
dither over decision. It prefers "consultants" and "facilitators" instead of
action. It is always just one consultants report short of a decision. For over
five years now Ryanair has offered to invest almost $1bn. in new aircraft, based
here in Ireland, deliver up to 20 new low fare European routes bringing over 5
million new visitors a year and creating 5,000 direct new Irish jobs and over
25,000 indirect jobs in Irish tourism. All of this at no cost to the Irish tax
payer, and yet this Government continues to dither and fudge".
"Two and a half years should be long enough for even Bertie Ahern to make a
decision. We need less Agendas for Action and more action. Instead of talking
about decisions, why doesn't the Government just make one. Irish tourism needs a
competing second terminal at Dublin, we want 5 million new visitors and we
demand 5,000 new jobs. All it takes is one decision".

                    HOCHE DEUTSCHLAND! (means "Go Germany!)
                 RYANAIR CELEBRATES 10M PASSENGERS IN GERMANY!
                  70,000 SEATS FOR FREE* FROM DUSSELDORF WEEZE!
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 16th November 2004)
celebrated carrying 10M passengers in Germany and announced a fantastic 70,000
FREE* seats sale (exc. taxes) from Dusseldorf Weeze Airport. Ryanair commenced
flying to/from Germany in 1999 with just 1 route from Frankfurt Hahn to London
Stansted. To date Ryanair successfully operates 39 international daily routes
from 8 regional airports throughout Germany.
Speaking in Dusseldorf Weeze Airport today, Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
        "In just 5 short years, Ryanair has grown to become Germany's No.1 low
         fares airline. Today we are celebrating carrying 10M passengers and
         celebrating our success here at Dusseldorf Weeze by giving 70,000
         ordinary German consumers the opportunity to fly for FREE!"
        "We started flying here to Dusseldorf Weeze in 2003, and this year we
         will carry over 300,000 passengers on our 5 international daily routes
         to/from Dusseldorf Weeze, saving consumers from the Dusseldorf region
Ryanair Holdings PLC Celebrating10m pass.inGermany
         over EUR30M off the fares charged by high fares airlines at Dusseldorf's
         "international" airport. However, Dusseldorf International Airport is
         desperately trying to prevent competition from Dusseldorf Weeze Airport
         and has gone so far as to prevent Weeze Airport from referring to
         "Dusseldorf" in its name, despite the fact that Weeze is officially
         designated by IATA as an airport serving the Dusseldorf region. This
         desperate act confirms the lengths that Dusseldorf International is
         willing to prevent competition and low fares for ordinary consumers in
         the region. We are confident Dusseldorf Weeze will succeed against
         Dusseldorf International's anti-competitive actions. "
        "Unfortuately Dusseldorf International Airport aren't the only ones
         trying to prevent low fares for ordinary German consumers. ADL, the
         "Cartel of German airlines," are using the Commission's flawed decision
         in the Charleroi case to try to limit competition in the German market.
         The arrangements that Ryanair has with the numerous underutilized
         regional and secondary airports in Germany are open to any airline who
         wants to deliver the kind of passenger numbers that we do to these
         airports. The deals are wide open and the ADL should stop whinging and
         trying to limit competition and come to the low cost, efficient airports
         that we operate to."

TBI PLC   ("TBI" or "the Group")
Interim Results for the Six Months ended 30 September 2004
The TBI Group is one of the UK's leading airport operators. It owns and/or
operates London Luton, Belfast International and Cardiff International Airports,
as well as a number of overseas airports.
                                    SUMMARY
   Group turnover increased 4% to GBP107.6 million (2003: GBP103.4 million)
   Operating profit was up 64% to GBP24.1 million (2003: GBP14.7 million)
   Profit before tax was up 167% to GBP19.2 million (2003: GBP7.2 million),
     reflecting improved recurrent trading and the absence of any exceptional
     charges during the period
   Earnings per share:  1.79 pence  (2003:  0.01 pence);  Earnings per share
     before amortisation and exceptional items: 2.53 pence (2003:  2.13 pence)
   Proposed interim dividend maintained at 0.70 pence
   Passengers* rose to 10.8 million during the first six months of the year
     (2003:  9.6 million), a rise of 12% primarily driven by low cost, although
     there was growth across all three categories of traffic (charter, full
     service and low cost)
TBI PLC Interim Results
   Significant expansion by both easyJet and Ryanair at London Luton:
     easyJet is increasing capacity by 25%, adding three new aircraft and Ryanair
     has committed four new aircraft and nine new routes although any additional
     revenue is not expected to impact the current financial year
   Acquisition of remaining 28.6% interest in London Luton Airport from
     Alterra for approximately GBP78 million giving the Group total control of this
     core asset.  This acquisition is subject to shareholders' consent and
     certain financing conditions
   Disposal of AGI airport services for approximately US$24.0 million in cash
     (GBP13.3 million)
   October traffic statistics show a 13.8% increase in passenger traffic at

     driven by low cost, up 19.4%
(* passengers = passengers excluding transit)
Keith Brooks, Chief Executive, comments:
"This period has been all about delivery. As well as producing increased
passenger numbers, revenues and profits, we have also achieved our objective of
making TBI a more focused airport operator. The sale of AGI ahead of schedule
and the acquisition of the London Luton minority leaves TBI well placed to
deliver increased value to shareholders."

Interim review 2004/5
Overview
These results reflect the growth in passenger volumes referred to in our trading
update last month. The number of passengers travelling through our airports in
the first six months of our financial year grew by 12% to 10.8 million
passengers (2003: 9.6 million). Whilst the majority of growth was driven by
passengers flying with low cost airlines, we saw growth in every category of
traffic (charter, full service and low cost) and at almost every airport. This
growth has translated to a GBP3.5 million increase in turnover at our owned
airports in the first half of the year, of which GBP2.7 million is reflected at
TBI PLC Interim Results
the operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and exceptional items ("
EBITDA") level.
During this period of steadily improving performance we have also brought to
fruition some of the objectives which management has been working on for some
time. On 27 October 2004 we announced, subject to shareholder approval and
certain financing conditions, the acquisition of the remaining 28.6%
shareholding in London Luton Airport Group Limited which we did not previously
own. On completion, the concession at London Luton Airport would be wholly owned
by TBI, with all the benefits - strategic and tactical, operational and
financial - that full control brings. On the same day, we also announced the
disposal of our Airport Services business, AGI, for approximately US$24.0
million in cash (GBP13.3 million). Plans to sell this business were announced at
the time of our preliminary announcement in June this year.
Financials
Passenger numbers in the first half of the year increased by 12% and this is the
key driver of our business, however the full financial impact of growth in
passenger numbers is almost always muted initially because of reductions in
average aeronautical revenues in the early years of new services coming on
stream. Total revenues therefore increased by 4% to GBP107.6 million (2003: GBP103.4
million).
The conversion of revenue to profit at our owned and managed airports is usually
at a high rate on the incremental revenues because airports are relatively fixed
cost in nature. Accordingly EBITDA increased by 8% to GBP35.3 million (2003: GBP32.7
million). For owned and managed airports this represented an EBITDA margin of
40% (2003: 38%) overall and a marginal rate of 77% on the incremental revenue.
Operating profit was GBP24.1 million (2003: GBP14.7 million).
Profit before tax for the period was GBP19.2 million (2003: GBP7.2 million),
reflecting both improved recurrent trading as well as the absence of any
exceptional charges during this period. Earnings per share for the six month
period were 1.79p (2003: 0.01p), or 2.53p (2003: 2.13p), before amortisation and
TBI PLC Interim Results
exceptional items. The interim dividend is being maintained at 0.70p per share.
This will be payable on 4 January 2005 to shareholders on the register at the
close of business on 26 November 2004.
London Luton
Overall passenger numbers increased by 9% to 4.1 million (2003: 3.8 million)
during the six months to 30th September 2004. In July both easyJet and Ryanair
announced significant expansion of their services out of London Luton,
commencing over the next eight months. easyJet will increase its capacity by
25%, adding three new aircraft, and Ryanair has committed four new aircraft and
nine new routes. This traffic has not yet started and therefore the benefit of
any additional revenue is not expected to impact the current financial period.
As a result of the capacity demand at Luton we have commenced an extensive
expansion programme. This is expected to complete in July 2005, to coincide with
the annual peak in passengers using the airport. The programme will cost
approximately GBP30.0 million, spread over two financial years, and will deliver a
new security hall to the first floor of the new terminal building and a new
airside facility to handle all passengers travelling through the airport. The
new airside facility will be some 9,000m2 - and will almost double the retail
and catering space. In addition there will be a new pier, a new immigration
hall, new arrivals and onward travel areas, eight new gates and two new aircraft
aprons. This development will provide capacity for up to 12.0 million passengers
a year.
Belfast International
Belfast ("BIA") has continued to demonstrate good growth in the six months to 30
September 2004. Passenger numbers were up 12% to 2.5 million (2003: 2.2 million)
due to strong low cost and charter growth. However, it is not anticipated that
the forthcoming winter charter traffic will demonstrate similar levels of
growth. The low cost growth profile is likely to extend into the winter period,
reflecting the full year effect of the new international services provided by
the low cost airlines. Continuing the theme of direct international services,
TBI PLC Interim Results
Continental Airlines has recently announced the launch of a non stop scheduled
service between Belfast and New York (Newark) from May 2005, firmly positioning
BIA as the only international gateway to Northern Ireland. It is anticipated
that this international service will benefit from high levels of demand both
from business and leisure customers in Northern Ireland and its catchment area.
Cardiff
Passenger numbers at Cardiff fell by 4% to 1.2 million (2003: 1.2 million),
primarily as a result of the reduction in capacity and services flown by
bmibaby. The financial impact of this was mitigated in part by the increase in
the number of passengers flying on KLM. Average aeronautical revenues per
passenger rose by 9% as a consequence of the change in mix.
We are delighted that the Welsh Assembly Government has announced the re-opening
of the Vale of Glamorgan Line with a new railway station adjacent to the airport
in Spring 2005. The station will be known as Rhoose Cardiff International
Airport and will improve access to this airport's natural catchment area.
Stockholm Skavsta
Skavsta has demonstrated strong growth in passenger numbers in the period, up
22% to 0.7 million (2003: 0.6 million), as a result of the success of the
Ryanair services. Not only did passenger volumes increase significantly but both
commercial and aeronautical revenues per passenger also increased. As a result,
turnover increased by approximately GBP0.8 million when compared with last year -
with a 100% rate of marginal conversion into EBITDA. More recently Ryanair has
announced that it will base a further aircraft at Stockholm Skavsta from March
2005 serving three new routes to Dusseldorf, Barcelona (Girona) and Riga.
Ryanair has subsequently announced that a further two aircraft will be based at
Stockholm Skavsta from 2006. Some limited additional investment will be
necessary to expand the ramp and apron at this location in order to accommodate
these additional services.
Orlando Sanford
In Orlando, notwithstanding the adverse weather conditions in August/September,
TBI PLC Interim Results
passenger numbers increased by almost 50% to 1.2 million (2003: 0.8 million).
Despite the GBP0.2 million cost of managing and maintaining the business through

                  RYANAIR CARRIES 0.5M MORE PASSENGERS THAN BA
                                  IN UK & EUROPE
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Wednesday, 10th November 2004)
celebrated carrying nearly half a million MORE passengers than BA in UK/Europe
during October. Passenger traffic statistics released by Ryanair and BA
confirmed Ryanair carried 2,462 M passengers in October 2004 - 443,000 MORE than
BA in UK/Europe.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "Each month more and more people are choosing Ryanair in Europe over BA,
         because only Ryanair offers Europe's lowest air fares coupled with No.1
         punctuality, frequency and customer service.
        "Since May BA has added not one, not two but THREE fuel surcharges to
         their already ludicrously expensive fares and the public are voting with
         their feet. Now we have nearly half a million extra confirmations that
         Ryanair is Britain's favourite airline in UK & Europe!"

                      RYANAIR PROFITS RISE 15% TO RECORD EUR201m
                       TRAFFIC GROWTH OF 24%, NET MARGIN OF 28%
    Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (2 Nov 2004) announced record
     half year profits of EUR201.3m. Traffic grew by 24% to 14.1m passengers,
     yields declined by 5% and consequently total revenues rose by 21% to
     EUR721.1m. Unit costs (excluding fuel and route charges) fell by 4% and
     (including fuel and route charges unit costs remained flat) and as a result
     the profit margin after tax declined by 1% to an industry leading 28%.

     (Note 1)
    Note 1:Adjusted profit after tax and EPS for 2003, excludes non-recurring
     costs of EUR2.7m (net of tax) arising from the earlier than planned retirement
     of 6 Boeing 737-200 aircraft, the re-organisation of "Buzz" in April'03 of
     EUR2.7m (net of tax), and finally a Goodwill charge of EUR1.2m in both
     periods.
    Announcing these results, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results
     "These record traffic and profit figures show just how robust Ryanair's
     "lowest fares" model remains even in a very difficult economic environment
     characterised by record fuel prices and intense price competition. Like
     Southwest, this is Ryanair's 30th consecutive quarter of unbroken
     profitability (before exceptionals) since we floated in May 1997.
    "Central to these record profits is Ryanair's continuing disciplined route
     growth. Our two new bases in Barcelona and Rome have exceeded expectations,
     as have the 41 other new routes launched this Summer. Our expansion
     continues this Winter with our Rome and Milan bases each getting two more
     aircraft. Our Frankfurt, Stockholm and Glasgow bases welcome one additional
     plane each, and our London Luton base rises from one 737-200 to four
     737-800's. This Winter will also see Ryanair open five new destinations with
     low fare flights to Riga (Latvia), Santander, Seville and Valencia (Spain)
     and Porto (Portugal).
    "Despite intense price competition and our own considerable growth, the
     yield decline of 5% for the half year was at the better end of our -5% to
     -10% guidance. We attribute this to a combination of slightly better peak
     Summer yields and the initial impact of the multiple fuel surcharges imposed
     by many of our high fare competitors which has increased the price
     differential, making Ryanair's low fares even more attractive to consumers.
    "Unit costs remained flat for the first half due to higher fuel and route
     charges which rose at a much faster rate than traffic growth. Excluding fuel
     and route charges, all other unit costs were reduced by 4% thanks to the
     addition of more cost efficient Boeing 737-800s, new lower cost airport
     agreements, and continuing tight control over all other costs. We continue
     to aggressively attack costs and have recently agreed the forward sale of
     our remaining 737-200 fleet for $10m as well as a new 10 year engine
     maintenance contract with General Electric (GE) which locks away significant
     cost reductions.
    "Our focus on continuously improving our No.1 customer service package
     remains relentless. We have again reduced Europe's lowest fares by 5% whilst
     delivering our passengers the best punctuality with the least cancellations
     and fewest lost bags in the industry. The UK CAA recently released on time
     statistics confirmed Ryanair as the No.1 on-time major airline operating to/
     from the main UK airports. In addition Ryanair customers are enjoying these
     benefits on a fleet of brand new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with all leather
     seating, through convenient local airports using Europe's largest travel
     website. Ryanair will shortly be the first low fares airline in the world to
     introduce an Inflight Entertainment System (IFE) for all passengers
     featuring latest Hollywood movies, chart topping music videos, kids
     cartoons, sitcoms and audio CDs. Ryanair's customer service offering is now
     superior to all of our high fare competitors and our rapid growth in traffic
     and market share testifies to this fact.
    "In Ireland we regret that the Minister for Transport who has spent two
     years trying to introduce real competition at the Government owned airport
     monopoly was moved to a different portfolio. We hope the new Minister will
     move quickly to promote the development of competing independent terminals
     at Dublin Airport. The 31st October last marks the second anniversary of
     this Government's receipt of 13 separate offers to develop a competing
     second terminal at Dublin. Despite enormous support from the entire tourism
     industry not one inch of progress has been made in two years to introduce
     competition to the Dublin Airport monopoly. We are concerned that the new
     Dublin Airport Authority has taken over where the old monopoly left off with
     an unnecessary proposal to build a second runway and waste EUR120m. The two
     existing runways at Dublin have just 16m passengers annually compared to the
     40m passenger traffic on the single runway at Gatwick. What Dublin needs is
     competing terminals not "Cartier runways". The Dublin Airport monopoly has
     repeatedly failed its customers, and we urge the Government to fix this by
     introducing competing terminals at Dublin which will revolutionise Irish
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results
     tourism.
    "The enormous impact of record fuel prices on the airline industry will
     impact future guidance. In November last year (during the run up to the Iraq
     War) when the cost per barrel surged we stopped our forward hedging policy.
     From November 2004 we are unhedged and will continue to remain so until
     forward rates return towards their previous "normal" levels. As usual much
     of the commentary on fuel prices in Ryanair has been hyperbolic. Ryanair can
     absorb much higher oil prices than its competitors and still offer the
     lowest air fares. We remain by some distance the most profitable airline in
     Europe. $50 a barrel for Brent crude for the remainder of this fiscal year
     will add some EUR55m to our total budgeted costs. However the multiple fuel
     surcharging policy of our competitors has seen our rate of yield decline
     ease. These stronger than expected yields will partially offset our higher
     fuel costs.
    "Furthermore, many of our competitor airlines who were losing money
     heroically when fuel was $25 per barrel are doomed the longer it stays at
     $50. Our prediction of a bloodbath and airline casualties this Winter may be
     accelerated by record high oil prices as well as irrational competition.
     Just two weeks ago V-Bird in Germany closed, and we believe it will be
     followed by other failures this Winter and beyond. Despite this environment
     Ryanair's world record margins enables us to absorb higher fuel prices -
     without resorting to surcharges - and still remain Europe's fastest growing
     most profitable airline.
    "We remain cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. We
     expect to achieve significant increases in passenger volume growth this
     fiscal year and increased load factors. We anticipate that yield attrition
     in Q3 and Q4 will now be better than our original -10% to -20% forecast and
     based on current financial booking trends should finish in the -5% to -10%
     range. This will help to partially offset higher fuel prices for the second
     half. We anticipate that there will be further airline casualties as the
     "perfect storm" of declining fares and record high oil prices force loss
     making carriers out of the industry. Despite increases in route charges and
     fuel prices we continue to generate better margins than all of our
     competitors. With the lowest cost base, the lowest fares and industry
     leading customer service, we believe that Ryanair will continue to grow
     profitably to the benefit of our customers, our people and our
     shareholders".

Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted profit and loss account excluding the non-recurring costs and goodwill
referred to below.
Non-recurring costs consisted of Buzz re-organisation costs of EUR2.7m (net of
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -3-
tax), and goodwill of EUR1.2m amounting to EUR3.9m (net of tax) in the half year
ended September 30, 2003 compared to EUR1.2m of goodwill in the period ended
September 30, 2004. During last year an additional amount of EUR2.7m was also
charged in the period arising from the write down in the residual value of

average sector length and the strengthening of the sterling exchange rate
against the euro whilst higher US$ fuel prices were partly offset by the
strength of the euro exchange rate against the US$.
Staff costs have increased by 11% to EUR35.2m primarily reflecting an increase in
average employee numbers to 2,595 and the impact of pay increases of 3% granted
during the period, offset by the lower level of productivity based pay as
sectors flown increased by 9%.
Depreciation and amortisation decreased by 10% to EUR21.3m. A higher depreciation
charge due to an increase in the size of the 'owned' fleet from 56 to 60, offset
by a lower amortisation charge due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the
positive impact of a new engine maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of
737-800 aircraft. The strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a positive
impact on the depreciation and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 42% to EUR61.9m due to an increase in the number of sectors
flown, a 10% increase in sector length, and a higher average US$ cost per gallon
of fuel offset by the positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -5-
dollar during the period.
Maintenance costs decreased by 2% to EUR10.8m reflecting the improved reliability
arising from the higher proportion of 737-800 operated and a lower level of
maintenance costs incurred due to the return of four BAE 146 aircraft to KLM
earlier in the year.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 53% to EUR3.5m due to a higher
promotional spend, and increased costs associated with the higher level of
activity.
Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR5.9m to EUR8.2m reflecting the increased costs
arising from the lease of ten 737-800 aircraft which were delivered in the
quarter to March 31, 2004 offset by the return of four BAE 146s to KLM.
Route charges increased by 25% to EUR34.7m due to an increase in the number
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in the
weight of the aircraft operated (which incur a higher charge), and the negative
impact of the strengthening of sterling against the Euro.
Airport and handling charges increased by 23% slightly more than the increase in
passenger volumes due to increased costs at certain existing airports offset by
lower costs at new airports, and the adverse impact of the strength of the
sterling exchange rate against the euro during the period.
Other expenses increased by 22% to EUR25.9m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have remained very robust at 41% although they were 1% lower
than last year, due to the reasons outlined above which has resulted in
Operating profits increasing by 14% to EUR170.7m during the quarter.
Interest receivable has increased by EUR0.7m due to the combined impact of higher
levels of cash and liquid resources and an improvement in average deposit
interest rates earned in the quarter compared to last year.
Interest payable increased by EUR1.6m due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the
purchase of new aircraft.

                       Notes to the Financial Statements
 1. Accounting Policies
     The accounting policies followed in the preparation of these consolidated
     financial statements for the half year ended September 30, 2004 are
     consistent with those set out in the financial statements for the year ended
     March 31, 2004.
 2. Approval of the Financial Statements
     The Audit Committee approved the consolidated financial statements for the
     Half year ended September 30, 2004 on October 29th, 2004.
 3. Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
     The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the Half year ended
     September 30, 2004 are based on the results reported under Irish and UK
     GAAP.
 4. Aircraft retirement costs
     Five aircraft were retired earlier than projected in 2003 due to the
     detection of scratch marks ('scribing') that occurred during an aircraft
     painting programme on these aircraft in 1995. It had been determined
     that the cost of repairing these aircraft was uneconomic due to the
     short remaining life of the aircraft. Accordingly the Company had
     determined that the residual value of US$1m(EUR794k) for these aircraft
     was excessive and as a result reduced it to EUR250k per aircraft. The cost
     of this adjustment charge was reflected in the results for Quarter ended
     September 30, 2003.
Independent review report by KPMG to Ryanair Holdings plc
Introduction
We have been instructed by the company to review the financial information set
out on pages 1 to 7 and we have read the other information contained in the
interim report and considered whether it contains any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial information.
Directors' responsibilities
The interim report, including the financial information contained therein, is
the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors
are responsible for preparing the interim report in accordance with the Listing
Rules of the Irish Stock Exchange which require that the accounting policies and
presentation applied to the interim figures should be consistent with those
applied in preparing the preceding annual accounts except where they are to be
changed in the next annual accounts in which case any changes, and the reasons
for them, are to be disclosed.
Review work performed
We conducted our review in accordance with guidance contained in Bulletin 1999/
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -5-
4: Review of interim financial information issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. A review consists principally of making enquiries of group management and
applying analytical procedures to the financial information and underlying
financial data and, based thereon, assessing whether the accounting policies and
presentation have been consistently applied unless otherwise disclosed. A review
is substantially less in scope than an audit performed in accordance with
Auditing Standards and therefore provides a lower level of assurance than an
audit. Accordingly we do not express an audit opinion on the financial
information.
Review conclusion
On the basis of our review we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the financial information as presented for the six months
ended 30 September 2004.

aircraft which was necessitated by the 'scribing' of five aircraft (Note 4).
Profit after tax increased by 18% to EUR200.1m during the six months compared to
last year. The adjusted profit for the half year, excluding non-recurring costs
and goodwill, increased by 15% to EUR201.3m.
Summary Half year ended September 30, 2004
Profit after tax increased by 15% to EUR201.3m, compared to EUR175.5m in the
previous half year ended September 30, 2003. These results were achieved by
strong growth in passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Total
operating revenues increased by 21% to EUR721.1m, which is slower than the 24%
growth in passenger volumes, and reflects the competitive fare environment, and
the company's objective of continuing to drive down average fares. Average fares
have however declined at the better end of the 5% to 10% range that we had
originally forecast. The combination of lower fares, the successful launch of
new routes and the slower rate of growth resulted in the Passenger Load Factor
increasing from 83% to 87% during the period.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR485.6m, due to the increased level
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -4-
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges and airport
& handling costs associated with the growth of the airline. Operating expenses
were also adversely impacted by the strengthening of the sterling to euro
exchange rate. Operating margins declined by 1% which in turn resulted in
Operating profit increasing by 16% from EUR203.3m to EUR235.5m. Profit after tax has
increased by 15%, slightly less than the growth in Operating profit and reflects
the higher net interest charge resulting primarily from the increased level of
debt during the period. Net Margins declined by 1 point to 28% for the reasons
outlined above.
Earnings per share have risen by 14% to 26.51 cent for the period.
Balance Sheet
The strong profit growth continues to positively impact the balance sheet with
Cash and Liquid Resources growing despite funding an additional EUR145.0m in
capital expenditure from internal resources. Cash balances at September 30, 2004
were EUR1,421.7m, an increase of EUR164.4m from March 31st 2004. Six aircraft were
delivered in the period which in addition to aircraft deposits accounted for the
bulk of the EUR208.5m incurred in capital expenditure. An additional EUR90.9m of
debt, net of repayments, was drawn down to part fund these aircraft deliveries
during the period. Shareholders' Funds at September 30, 2004 have increased to
EUR1,655.6m, compared to EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Half year ended September 30, 2004
Profit after tax, increased by 15% to EUR201.3m driven by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Operating margins declined
by 1% which has resulted in Operating profit increasing by EUR32.2m to EUR235.5m
compared to half year ended September 30, 2003.
Total operating revenues increased by 21% to EUR721.1m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 24% to 14.0m.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 18% to EUR617.6m due to a combination of
increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Rome-Ciampino and Barcelona-Girona, and the commencement of 38 new
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -4-
routes during the period, primarily offset by a 5% reduction in average fares.
The strong growth in passenger volumes is also reflected in the improvement in
the load factor achieved, which rose from 83% to 87% in the period.
Ancillary revenues continue to perform strongly with revenues growing by 42% to
EUR103.4m in the period. This performance reflects the strong growth in non-flight
scheduled revenues, car hire and other ancillary products. Ancillary revenues
continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and now account for 14%
of total revenues compared to 12% last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR485.6m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily maintenance, fuel, aircraft
rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth
of the airline. The increase in total operating expenses were also due to the
higher level of activity and the stronger Sterling to Euro exchange rate partly
offset by a stronger Euro to US$ exchange rate.
Staff costs have increased by 13% to EUR69.3m. This increase primarily reflects a
13% increase in average employee numbers to 2,531 and the impact of pay
increases of 3% granted during the period offset by the lower level of
productivity based payments as sectors flown increased by 10%.
Depreciation and amortisation declined by 4% to EUR44.9m. There are an additional
six 'owned' 737-800 aircraft in the fleet this year compared to last year,
however during the same period the company has retired three 737-200 aircraft.
The resultant higher depreciation charge was offset by a combination of lower
amortisation due to the retirement of 737-200 aircraft and the positive impact
of a new maintenance deal on the cost of amortisation of 737-800 aircraft. The
strengthening of the euro to US$ also had a positive impact on the depreciation
and amortisation charge.
Fuel costs rose by 35% to EUR113.8m due to a 23% increase in the number of hours
flown, an increase in the average US$ cost per gallon of fuel offset by the
positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US dollar during the
period.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -4-
Maintenance costs increased by 12% to EUR24.9m reflecting an increase in the size
of the fleet operated, and an increase in the number of hours flown offset by
maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from the higher
proportion of 737-800 operated. Four BAE 146 aircraft, which incurred higher
maintenance charges per aircraft operated compared to the remainder of the
fleet, were returned to KLM earlier this year.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 8% to EUR10.8m due to higher spend
on promoting new routes and an increase in the level of activity during the
period.
Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR12.5m to EUR16.2m reflecting the increased
costs associated with the lease of ten 737-800 aircraft which were delivered in
the period to March 31, 2004 offset by the return to KLM of four BAE 146
aircraft earlier this year.
Route charges increased by 28% to EUR67.9m due to an increase in the number
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length, an increase in the
weight of the aircraft operated (which incur a higher charge), and the negative
impact of the strengthening of sterling against the Euro during the period.
Airport and handling charges increased by 25% to EUR90.3m, slightly more than the
increase in passenger volumes due to increased costs at certain existing
airports offset by lower costs at new airports, and the adverse impact of the
strength of the sterling exchange rate against the euro during the period.
Other expenses increased by 20% to EUR47.5m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have remained very strong at 33% for the period due to the
reasons outlined above which has resulted in Operating profits increasing by 16%
to EUR235.5m.
Interest receivable has only increased by EUR0.3m despite an increase in the level
of cash and liquid resources and highlights the lower deposit interest rates
earned in the period compared to last year. Interest payable increased by EUR3.1m
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -4-
due to the drawdown of debt to part fund the purchase of new aircraft during the
period.
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in
profits during the period. The Company generated cash from operating activities
of EUR296.3m, which part funded additional capital expenditure of EUR208.5m Capital
expenditure primarily comprised of the delivery of 6 aircraft and further
advance payments for future aircraft deliveries. Long term Debt, net of
repayments increased by EUR90.9m which was drawn down to part fund aircraft
deliveries during the period. Cash and liquid resources continued to reflect the
strong trading performance of the company during the period and at September 30,
2004 stood at EUR1,421.7m compared to EUR1,257.4 at March 31, 2004.
Shareholders' Funds at September 30, 2004 have increased to EUR1,655.6m compared
to EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended September 30, 2004
Profit after tax, increased by 12% to EUR148.1m driven by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Operating margins have
remained strong at 41% although slightly down on last year, which has resulted
in Operating profit increasing by EUR20.5m to EUR170.7m compared to quarter ended
September 30, 2003.
Total operating revenues increased by 19% to EUR418.3m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 20% to 7.4m.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 16% to EUR358.6m due to a combination of
increased passenger volumes on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Rome-Ciampino and Barcelona-Girona offset by a 3% reduction in average
fares. The strong growth in passenger volumes is also reflected in the
improvement in the load factor achieved, which rose from 87% to 90% in the
quarter.
Ancillary revenues increased 43% to EUR59.8m, a faster growth rate than passenger
volumes, reflecting a strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues, car
hire and other ancillary products. Ancillary revenues continue to grow at a
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair 's Half Year Results -4-
faster rate than passenger volumes and now account for 14% of total revenues
compared to 12% for the same period last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 23% to EUR247.6m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, aircraft rentals, route
charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth of the
airline. Total operating costs were also adversely impacted by increases in the

Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 12th October 2004)
re-iterated its promise of NO FUEL SURCHARGES as Europe's high fares airlines

added even MORE fuel surcharges to consumers.
Speaking this morning, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "Ryanair is committed to delivering Europe's lowest fares to ordinary
         European consumers every day, and we are committed to NO FUEL
         SURCHARGES, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. High fare airlines
         continue to penalise ordinary consumers with more fuel surcharges and
         even higher fares.
        "It is no wonder millions of consumers are choosing Ryanair and are
         voting with their feet, because only Ryanair offers passengers Europe's
         lowest fares, unbeatable punctuality and customer service and GUARANTEED
         no fuel surcharges".

TBI PLC
("TBI" or "the Group")
Pre-close trading update and Q2 traffic statistics
The Board of TBI confirms that trading for the first half is in line with
expectations. The growth in passenger traffic to both domestic and European
destinations, which characterised the initial weeks of the period, has
continued. While low-cost travel remains the driver of volume growth, the Group
has continued to see passenger traffic increase across all three types of
service at its four European airports which is encouraging in what remains a
competitive industry environment generally.
During the three months to 30 September 2004, low cost traffic increased 12%,
while charter grew by 1% and full service was up 7%, averaging an 11% increase
across the Group's portfolio. This was ahead of Q1 passenger numbers and
TBI PLC Trading Statement
therefore the six month growth rate for the Group's European airports was just
short of 9%.
Overall passenger numbers at London Luton increased by 9% during the six months
 to 30 September 2004.  Both easyJet and Ryanair announced significant expansion
 of their respective services out of Luton in July.  easyJet will increase its
 capacity by 25% adding three new aircraft and Ryanair has committed four new
 aircraft and nine new routes to this location.   This additional traffic has not
 yet started and accordingly whilst such growth in low cost traffic volumes is
 clearly encouraging, the benefit of any extra revenue is not expected to impact
 in the current year.
An extensive expansion programme at London Luton has now commenced.   Due to
 complete in July 2005, this involves a significant capital investment in the
 facilities at  the airport, which will deliver a new security hall to the first
 floor of the existing terminal building and a new airside facility to handle all
 passengers travelling through the airport.  The new airside facility will be
 some 9,000 sqm - and will almost treble the retail and catering space.  In
 addition, there will be a new walkway and exits, a new immigration hall, new
 arrivals and onward travel area and additional ramp and gates.
Belfast International ("BIA") has continued to see good growth in the current
 year.  Passenger numbers were up 12% in the first half due to strong low cost
 and charter growth.  The forthcoming Winter charter traffic will not demonstrate
 similar levels of growth.  Continental Airlines, the US carrier, has today
 announced the launch of a non-stop, scheduled service which will operate daily
 between Belfast and New York (Newark), reinforcing BIA's position as the only
 international gateway to Northern Ireland.   Due to commence in May 2005, it is
 anticipated that this international service will see high levels of demand from
 both business and tourist customers in Northern Ireland and its surrounding
 catchment area.
Cardiff International saw a minor fall off in passenger numbers as a result of
the reduction in capacity and services flown by bmibaby previously explained at
the time of our preliminary announcement in June. However, Cardiff continues to
generate good levels of cash and will benefit from important infrastructure
development with the opening of a new railway station adjacent to the airport in
May 2005.
Stockholm-Skavsta saw passenger traffic increase by 22% in the six months to
 September 2004 and it is anticipated that this airport will at least break even
 at the EBITDA level in the first half, a trend which looks likely to continue
 for the rest of this financial year.  In September, Ryanair announced the
 expansion to its base at Stockholm-Skavsta from March 2005 adding a fourth
 Boeing 737-800 aircraft to its existing fleet in this location, together with
 three new European routes to Dusseldorf, Barcelona (Girona) and Riga bringing
 its total number of routes out of this location to 11.   It is anticipated that
 some limited additional investment will be necessary to expand the ramp and
 apron at his location in order to accommodate additional services.
Traffic at Orlando Sanford has continued to build and benefited from a buoyant
performance in spite of the adverse weather conditions that this area of the US
has experienced recently. It is anticipated that Orlando will suffer
approximately GBP200,000 of lost revenue or extra costs as a direct result of the
TBI PLC Trading Statement
hurricanes which affected the vicinity.
Earlier in the year the Board highlighted its intention to dispose of the
Group's non core assets in Bolivia and its airport services business in the US
("AGI"). The disposal process for our airports in Bolivia is now well underway
and the process for AGI is well advanced. The Directors remain confident of
completing the disposals of each operation by the end of the current financial
year.
TBI's interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2004 will be
announced on 16th November 2004.

                  RYANAIR SELLS BOEING 737-200 FLEET FOR $10M
Ryanair Holding plc, Europe's No. 1 low fare airline, today (Monday, 4th October
2004) announced that it had sold its fleet of 20 Boeing 737-200 aircraft to
Autodirect Aviation LLC ("Autodirect") including spare engines and parts for a
total consideration of $10m.
The 20 Boeing 737-200 aircraft were manufactured between 1980 and 1983 and 6 of
the 20 aircraft have already been retired by Ryanair from operation. The
remaining 14 will be delivered to Autodirect post their scheduled retirement
between November 2004 and December 2005. The aircraft, spare parts and engines
will be fully depreciated at their date of disposal and accordingly, there is no
gain or loss arising on their disposal.
Autodirect is a US based corporation, which supplies used aircraft and spare
parts to the airline industry.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR SELLS BOEING 737-200
Speaking on today's announcement, Ryanair's Deputy Chief Executive, Howard
Millar said:
        "We are pleased to have reached an agreement deal with Autodirect to
         sell our Boeing 737-200 aircraft on their retirement from the Ryanair
         fleet. By the end of next year, Ryanair will have one of the youngest
         aircraft fleets in Europe and be the largest operator of Boeing Next
         Generation 737 aircraft.
        "The move to an all new Boeing 737-800 fleet offers enhanced comfort for
         our passengers and ensures that Ryanair will continue to offer even more
         low fares to the 27.5 million European passengers we expect to carry
         this fiscal year. The all new aircraft fleet will also strengthen our
         position as the lowest cost airline in Europe".

                       RYANAIR ANNOUNCES FOUR NEW ROUTES
          Big expansion in Spain and first daily services to Portugal
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline today (Tuesday, 21st September 2004)
announced four new low fares routes from London Stansted to Spain and Portugal.
The new routes, which will commence on dates between the 2nd November 2004 and
the 25th February 2005, will give even greater choice to consumers of Ryanair's
lowest fares. This brings to 78 the number of routes offered by Ryanair from
London Stansted and to 12 the total number of airports served in the Iberian
Peninsula from London.
From London Stansted     Starts                    Starting fares (excl. taxes)
       Valencia           2 Nov                             GBP0.99
       Almeria            19 Jan                            GBP0.99
        Porto             19 Jan                            GBP3.99
       Seville            25 Feb                            GBP4.99
Announcing the new routes in London today, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael
Ryanair Holdings PLC Four New Routes Announced
O'Leary said:
        "We opened our first route to Spain in November 2002 and, with this
         announcement today, Ryanair will serve more Spanish airports (10)
         directly from London than any other airline. We are also delighted to
         launch our first scheduled route from London to Portugal with a
         twice-daily service to Porto, Portugal's second largest city. This year
         Ryanair will carry over 4 million passengers on our routes to Spain and
         next year we expect to see that figure rise to 5.5 million.
        "Two of these routes, Valencia and Almeria, have already been announced
         by Easyjet but, as in the case of Barcelona (Girona), Reus and
         Santander, where we compete with them, it is only by flying with Ryanair
         will consumers enjoy the lowest airfares and the best punctuality.
         Easyjet's average fare remains more than 60% higher than Ryanair while
         their on time performance has trailed behind Ryanair's for over 100
         weeks in a row. In total our passengers on these routes will save over
         GBP86 million against the same services offered by Easyjet.
        "These fantastic new Spanish and Portuguese routes are on sale from
         today at www.ryanair.com from an incredible GBP0.99 (excluding taxes) and
         at these fantastic prices we urge passengers to book quickly as these
         seats will be in huge demand".

                               RYANAIR STATEMENT
                   ON IRISH TIMES UNTRUE AND INACCURATE ARTICLE
                             FRIDAY, 20TH AUGUST 2004
Speaking this morning Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "Siobhan Creaton's article in this morning's Irish Times is factually
         incorrect and substantively inaccurate. Ryanair currently employs just
         under 250 pilots in Stansted, over 200 of whom recently attended the
         Town Hall meetings. The claim that 'hundreds of the airline's pilots
         boycotted the meetings' is untrue.
        "The meetings, which were part of our regular Town Hall meetings, were
         called to brief pilots on current trading and upcoming Company activity,
         and were not as falsely claimed in the Irish Times 'to prevent them
         joining' a pilots union.
        "Ryanair has repeatedly confirmed that it recognises the right of all
         its people to join unions or associations should they so wish, and yet
         the Irish Times continues to repeatedly misrepresent this position.
        "Ryanair's pilots have recently received a 3% pay increase, which
         resulted in their take home pay being increased- even after cost cutting
         measures - which again is the factual opposite of the untrue claim in
         the Irish Times article.
        "The claim in the Irish Times that Ryanair Management was incensed by
         'the pilots boycott' is a further untruth since over 80% of pilots
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Statement
         attended these meetings.
        "Ryanair's pilots continue to be among the best paid, enjoy the best
         rosters, the most profitable share option scheme, and enjoy rapid
         promotion on a fleet of brand new Boeing 737-800 aircraft. There is a
         very low rate of turnover, and at present a waiting list of more than
         300 qualified pilots waiting to take up these highly paid and much
         sought after jobs. These facts highlight the untruth in the Irish Times
         claim that the relationship between Ryanair and its pilots 'has reached
         a new low'.
        "Ryanair has written today to the Irish Times demanding a correction of
         this untrue and inaccurate article".
Ends. Friday,                      20th August 2004

12TH AUGUST 2004.
                 RYANAIR CONDEMNS AIR FRANCE / KLM PRICE HIKES
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (12th August 04) condemned the
Air France/KLM price increases as anti-consumer following media reports that the
merged mega-carrier planned to INCREASE it's already high fares because it "was
seeing higher bookings". Air France/KLM are now using their increased dominance
to gouge consumers even further.
Ryanair warned the European Commission in September 2003 that this merger would
lead to less competition, increased fares and less consumer choice, and also
confirmed it has sent an official letter of complaint to the EC Competition
Directorate.
Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said:
"Last year we warned the Commission that the merger of Air France & KLM would be
Ryanair Holdings PLC Condemns Price Hikes
a bad day for consumers and passengers alike - and today they have announced
more price increases on their already high fares. Mega-carriers are
fundamentally anti-competitive as they reduce competition and choice and
increase prices to consumers.
Today we have written to the European Commission's Competition Directorate,
highlighting this anti-consumer abuse and the gross error made by the EC in
allowing this anti-competitive, anti-consumer merger in the first place. We are
also calling on the EC to force Air France/KLM to now deliver on their promises
of offering lower fares for consumers because of their so-called merged
economies of scale.
European consumers can rest assured that Ryanair will continue to provide
Europe's lowest air fares and No.1 punctuality and customer service, and will
continue to reduce prices and fight anti-consumer abuses by high fares
mega-carriers like Air France/KLM."

               RYANAIR SAYS ARRIVEDERCI TO ALITALIA'S HIGH FARES
         RYANAIR GUARANTEES TO FIGHT FOR LOW FARES FOR ITALIAN CONSUMERS
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today ( 10th August 04) criticised the
Italian authorities over their attempt to prop-up the failed national carrier
Alitalia and prevent ordinary Italian consumers accessing low fares.
The move, which according to ENAC (Italian Civil Aviation Authority) Chairman,
Vito Riggio "has been authorised by the European Union", is a blatant attempt to
pervert competition in the Italian market by preventing any carrier selling
tickets for less than the high fares of Alitalia.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Regulatory Affairs, Jim Callaghan said:
"The Italian authorities are more interested in pumping millions of Euro into
the failed Alitalia than providing competition and low fares for ordinary
Italian consumers. Italian consumers are being ripped-off by Alitalia's high
Ryanair Holdings PLC ALITALIA 'S HIGH FARES
fares with the governments blessing and active support.
It is outrageous that such a move is "authorised by the EU" because it means the
EU is actively supporting reduced competition and allowing the Italian
authorities to artificially keep prices high for Italian consumers - a move that
is ant0-competitive and anti-consumer. This latest lunacy comes weeks after the
European Commission authorised even more State Aid to the failed Italian
national carrier, indicating the double standards of the EC regarding national
airlines. It's one rule for the Italians and another rule for everyone else.
Our message to Italian consumers is clear - Ryanair will continue to offer
Italian consumers and visitors Europe's lowest air fares - the same low fares
enjoyed by millions of people in 16 other European countries."

Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (9th August 04) reiterated its
guarantee that there would be NO fuel surchargesfor Ryanair passengers this
year, as BA announces a second round of even HIGHER fuel surcharges to
passengers.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
"Ryanair is committed to giving passengers Europe's lowest fares everyday. Our
pledge to consumers is clear and unambiguous - the fare you pay, is the fare you
pay. Every Ryanair passenger can rest assured that Ryanair guarantees no fuel
surcharges - not today, not tomorrow, not ever.
BA's first instinct last May was to penalise passengers with a fuel surcharge
instead of reducing costs to pay for higher oil prices, and today they're at it
Ryanair Holdings PLC GUARANTEES NO FUEL SURCHARGES
again, with a second round of even HIGHER fuel surcharges. It is wrong, unfair
and anti-consumer that passengers who have already purchased high priced BA
tickets, and paid a fuel surcharge now have to pay a second surcharge. BA are
nothing more than a bunch of price gougers, ripping off consumers with high
fares and surcharges.
At Ryanair we believe in low fares. That's why Ryanair is the UK's favourite
airline for UK/European travel."

           RYANAIR SAYS TRADING STANDARDS INSTITUTE IS ANTI-CONSUMER
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Monday, 9th August 2004)
criticised the Trading Standards Institute for wasting thousands of pounds of
tax payer's money on court action over Ryanair's low fares on the day when
British Airways announced it was more that DOUBLING it's fuel surcharges to
consumers.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "Ryanair is Europe's No. 1 low fares airline because Ryanair has given
         millions of ordinary consumers access to low fares in the UK and
         throughout Europe. This year alone Ryanair will save UK consumers GBP2
         Billion on the high fares charged by other airlines. The Trading
         Standards Institute's time would be better spent fighting the
         anti-consumer rip-off of BA's ever increasing fuel surcharges.
        "Trading Standards Institute take note: with Ryanair the fare you pay,
         is the fare you pay - no fuel surcharges guaranteed. With BA, the high
         fares just get higher with even MORE surcharges, on top of the fares
         already paid by consumers - and this comes with zero action from the
         Trading Standards Institute.
Ryanair Holdings PLC TradingStandards anticonsumer
        "Ryanair will continue to provide Europe's lowest fares for British
         consumers, with GUARANTEED no fuel surcharges, while BA keeps adding
         surcharges and the Trading Standards Institute stands idly by."

                 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES Q1 PROFIT INCREASE OF 21%
                    NET MARGIN OF 18%, AS TRAFFIC GROWS 28%
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 3rd August 2004)
announced record profits for Q1 ended 30 June 2004 of EUR53.1m. Passenger volumes
grew by a record 28% to 6.6m passengers whilst yields declined by 6% during the
quarter and, as a result, total revenues rose by 23% to EUR302.8m. Unit costs fell
by 4% and in turn the net margin after tax remains stable at an industry leading
18%.

Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
Note 1: Adjusted profit after tax and EPS excludes the non-recurring costs of
the re-organisation of "Buzz" in April 2003 of EUR2.7m (net of tax) and goodwill
charges arising of EUR0.6m in both the quarters ended 30 June 2003 and 2004.
Announcing these results, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
        "These record quarterly results reflect the continued disciplined roll
         out of Ryanair's low fares model. Passenger volumes grew by 28% to 6.6m
         in the quarter and we carried more passengers in 3 months than the total
         traffic carried by Aer Lingus in a full year. Our two new bases at Rome
         Ciampino and Barcelona Girona have performed particularly well.
         Ryanair's strong performance is also reflected in the recent increases
         in monthly traffic and load factors.
        "Yields were 6% lower than last year, a decline that was towards the
         lower end of our -5% to -10% guidance. Our forward yield guidance
         remains unchanged. In Quarter 2 we anticipate a yield decline of between
         -5% to -10%. Next winter, we expect the yield decline to be in the -10%
         to - 20% range as chronically loss making competitors will continue to
         dump prices, resulting in even more airline casualties this winter.
        "The higher oil prices have continued through the summer and unlike many
         high fare flag competitors, we have not imposed fuel surcharges. We
         remain almost fully hedged until the end of Quarter 2 but largely
         unhedged thereafter. We believe that over the medium term prices will
         fall and therefore it would be unwise to lock-in at the current high
         rates. We anticipate that we will be able to largely offset these higher
         oil prices in this fiscal year by making cost savings in other areas.
        "We have announced a major expansion of our London Luton base from 1 to
         4 aircraft. In addition to our successful Dublin and Milan routes, we
         will now fly from Luton to Barcelona Girona, Barcelona Reus, and Murcia
         in Spain, Dinard and Nimes in France, Esjberg in Denmark, Rome Ciampino
         and Venice in Italy, and Stockholm in Sweden. We have also announced two
         new routes from London Stansted to Santander and Zaragossa in Spain and
         continue to grow our base at Rome Ciampino launching new routes to
         Santander in Spain, Paris-Beauvais and Eindhoven in Holland. We also
         have launched our expansion into the new EU member countries and will
         start 3 routes from Riga - the capital city of Latvia - to London,
         Tampere and Frankfurt on 30 October next. Many more airports continue to
         encourage Ryanair to launch new routes and as usual we have far more
         offers than we can presently handle and this will drive down airport
         costs.
        "Unit costs fell by 4% during the quarter (excluding fuel and route
         charges unit costs fell by 5.4%). We continue to benefit from the
         ongoing introduction of the larger 737-800's as they replace the
         remaining thirteen 737-200's. The remaining 737-200's will be retired by
         December 2005. We continue to focus on lowering our cost base and pass
         on these lower costs in the form of even lower fares to our passengers.
         "The legislation recently introduced by the Irish government to break up
         Aer Rianta will enable (for the first time ever) all of the government
         owned Irish airports to compete on a level playing field. We welcome
         this much delayed legislation and encourage the Minister to quickly
         introduce competition at Dublin airport by directing the construction of
         a second and third competing terminals. This initiative will finally
         introduce competition, will result in lower prices, deliver better
         facilities, and bring millions more visitors to Ireland.
        "We have recently filed proceedings in the High Court in London for the
         recovery of overcharging on fuel levies by BAA plc, the monopoly
         operator of London's three major airports. The BAA has been charging a
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
         fuel levy since 1991, which was agreed at the time to recover the GBP12.5m
         cost of the fuel hydrant system. Since that date, thanks to Ryanair's
         enormous growth, BAA has recovered over GBP39m in fuel levies or more than
         three times the original cost and yet this extortionate levy remains
         unchanged. BAA have also issued Court proceedings arising out of the
         fuel levy dispute and we look forward to the Court's ruling on the BAA
         overcharging. Ryanair continues to oppose anti-consumer charges at these
         monopoly airports. It is untenable for the BAA airport monopoly to
         impose fuel levies in excess of 300% of cost on its low fare consumers,
         whilst at the same time providing free of charge car parking to
         politicians. This anti-consumer rip-off must end.
        "We continue to be cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the
         year. We expect to achieve passenger volume growth this fiscal year in
         the order of 20% and deliver increased load factors. We believe that
         yield attrition this winter will be within our forecast range of -10% to
         -20%. The reality is that the high cost, high fare airlines, and those
         so called low fare loss makers are unable to compete with Ryanair's low
         fares, low cost base and industry leading customer service. As Southwest
         has repeatedly demonstrated in the US for many years, the lowest cost
         carrier always wins."

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted profit and loss account excluding the non-recurring costs and goodwill
referred to below.
Non-recurring costs consisted of Buzz re-organisation costs of EUR2.7m (net of
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results - Amend -3-
tax), and goodwill of EUR0.6m amounting to EUR3.3m (net of tax) in the quarter ended
June 30, 2003 compared to EUR0.6m of goodwill in the quarter ended June 30, 2004.
Profit after tax increased by 30% to EUR52.6m during the quarter compared to last
year. The adjusted profit for the quarter, excluding non-recurring costs and
goodwill, increased by 21% to EUR53.1m.
Summary Quarter Ended June 30, 2004
Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR53.1m, compared to EUR43.8m in the previous
quarter ended June 30, 2003. These results were achieved by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Total operating revenues
increased by 23% to EUR302.8m, which is slower than the growth in passenger
volumes of 28%, and reflects the competitive fare environment, and the company's
objective of continuing to drive down average fares. The combination of lower
fares and the successful launch of new routes and the slower rate of growth
resulted in the Passenger Load Factor increasing from 78% to 83% during the
period.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR238.0m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, maintenance, route charges
and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Operating margins have remained stable due to the continuing tight control on
costs, which in turn resulted in Operating profit increasing by 22% from EUR53.1m
to EUR64.8m. Profit after tax has increased by 21%, slightly less than the growth
in Operating profit and reflects the higher net interest charge in the period
arising due to the increased level of debt and lower deposit interest earned.
Net Margins have remained at 18% for the quarter.
Earnings per share have risen in line with profit growth by 21% to 7.0 cent for
the quarter.
Balance Sheet
The strong profit growth continues to positively impact the balance sheet with
Cash and Liquid Resources growing despite funding an additional EUR60.5m in
capital expenditure from internal resources. Cash balances at June 30, 2004 were
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results - Amend -3-
EUR1,327.0m, an increase of EUR69.7m from March 31st 2004. No additional debt was
drawn down in the quarter whilst loan repayments resulted in debt levels
declining by EUR19.5m to EUR933.5m. Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2004 have
increased to EUR1,508.0m, compared to EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended June 30, 2004
Profit after tax, increased by 21% to EUR53.1m driven by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Operating margins have
remained stable at 21%, which has resulted in Operating profit increasing by
EUR11.7m to EUR64.8m compared to quarter ended June 30, 2003.
Total operating revenues increased by 23% to EUR302.84m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 28% to 6.6m.

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted profit and loss account excluding the non-recurring costs and goodwill
referred to below.
Non-recurring costs consisted of Buzz re-organisation costs of EUR2.7m (net of
tax), and goodwill of EUR0.6m amounting to EUR3.3m (net of tax) in the quarter ended
June 30, 2003 compared to EUR0.6m of goodwill in the quarter ended June 30, 2004.
Profit after tax increased by 30% to EUR52.6m during the quarter compared to last
year. The adjusted profit for the quarter, excluding non-recurring costs and
goodwill, increased by 21% to EUR53.1m.
Summary Quarter Ended June 30, 2004
Profit after tax increased by 21% to EUR53.1m, compared to EUR43.8m in the previous
quarter ended June 30, 2003. These results were achieved by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Total operating revenues
increased by 23% to EUR302.8m, which is slower than the growth in passenger
volumes of 28%, and reflects the competitive fare environment, and the company's
objective of continuing to drive down average fares. The combination of lower
fares and the successful launch of new routes and the slower rate of growth
resulted in the Passenger Load Factor increasing from 78% to 83% during the
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -3-
period.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR238.0m, due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, maintenance, route charges
and airport & handling costs associated with the growth of the airline.
Operating margins have remained stable due to the continuing tight control on
costs, which in turn resulted in Operating profit increasing by 22% from EUR53.1m
to EUR64.8m. Profit after tax has increased by 21%, slightly less than the growth
in Operating profit and reflects the higher net interest charge in the period
arising due to the increased level of debt and lower deposit interest earned.
Net Margins have remained at 18% for the quarter.
Earnings per share have risen in line with profit growth by 21% to 7.0 cent for
the quarter.
Balance Sheet
The strong profit growth continues to positively impact the balance sheet with
Cash and Liquid Resources growing despite funding an additional EUR60.5m in
capital expenditure from internal resources. Cash balances at June 30, 2004 were
EUR1,327.0m, an increase of EUR69.7m from March 31st 2004. No additional debt was
drawn down in the quarter whilst loan repayments resulted in debt levels
declining by EUR19.5m to EUR933.5m. Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2004 have
increased to EUR1,508.0m, compared to EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis Quarter Ended June 30, 2004
Profit after tax, increased by 21% to EUR53.1m driven by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control. Operating margins have
remained stable at 21%, which has resulted in Operating profit increasing by
EUR11.7m to EUR64.8m compared to quarter ended June 30, 2003.
Total operating revenues increased by 23% to EUR302.84m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 28% to 6.6m.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 21% to EUR259.1m due to a combination of
increased passenger numbers on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Rome-Ciampino and Barcelona-Girona, and the commencement of 7 new
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -3-
routes in April '04, primarily offset by a 6% reduction in average fares. The
strong growth in passenger volumes is also reflected in the improvement in the
load factor achieved, which rose from 78% to 83% in the quarter.
Ancillary revenues increased by 40% to EUR43.7m, reflecting strong growth in
non-flight scheduled revenues, car rentals and other ancillary products.
Ancillary revenues continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and
accounted for 14% of total revenues during the period compared to 13% last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR238.0m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily maintenance, fuel, aircraft
rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth
of the airline. Increases in total operating expenses due to the higher level of
activity were partly offset by the positive impact of the strength of the euro

the re-organisation of "Buzz" in April 2003 of EUR2.7m (net of tax) and goodwill
charges arising of EUR0.6m in both the quarters ended 30 June 2003 and 2004.
Announcing these results, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary said:
        "These record quarterly results reflect the continued disciplined roll
         out of Ryanair's low fares model. Passenger volumes grew by 28% to 6.6m
         in the quarter and we carried more passengers in 3 months than the total
         traffic carried by Aer Lingus in a full year. Our two new bases at Rome
         Ciampino and Barcelona Girona have performed particularly well.
         Ryanair's strong performance is also reflected in the recent increases
         in monthly traffic and load factors.
        "Yields were 6% lower than last year, a decline that was towards the
         lower end of our -5% to -10% guidance. Our forward yield guidance
         remains unchanged. In Quarter 2 we anticipate a yield decline of between
         -5% to -10%. Next winter, we expect the yield decline to be in the -10%
         to - 20% range as chronically loss making competitors will continue to
         dump prices, resulting in even more airline casualties this winter.
        "The higher oil prices have continued through the summer and unlike many
         high fare flag competitors, we have not imposed fuel surcharges. We
         remain almost fully hedged until the end of Quarter 2 but largely
         unhedged thereafter. We believe that over the medium term prices will
         fall and therefore it would be unwise to lock-in at the current high
         rates. We anticipate that we will be able to largely offset these higher
         oil prices in this fiscal year by making cost savings in other areas.
        "We have announced a major expansion of our London Luton base from 1 to
         4 aircraft. In addition to our successful Dublin and Milan routes, we
         will now fly from Luton to Barcelona Girona, Barcelona Reus, and Murcia
         in Spain, Dinard and Nimes in France, Esjberg in Denmark, Rome Ciampino
         and Venice in Italy, and Stockholm in Sweden. We have also announced two
         new routes from London Stansted to Santander and Zaragossa in Spain and
         continue to grow our base at Rome Ciampino launching new routes to
         Santander in Spain, Paris-Beauvais and Eindhoven in Holland. We also
         have launched our expansion into the new EU member countries and will
         start 3 routes from Riga - the capital city of Latvia - to London,
         Tampere and Frankfurt on 30 October next. Many more airports continue to
         encourage Ryanair to launch new routes and as usual we have far more
         offers than we can presently handle and this will drive down airport
         costs.
        "Unit costs fell by 4% during the quarter (excluding fuel and route
         charges unit costs fell by 5.4%). We continue to benefit from the
         ongoing introduction of the larger 737-800's as they replace the
         remaining thirteen 737-200's. The remaining 737-200's will be retired by
         December 2005. We continue to focus on lowering our cost base and pass
         on these lower costs in the form of even lower fares to our passengers.
        "The legislation recently introduced by the Irish government to break up
         Aer Rianta will enable (for the first time ever) all of the government
         owned Irish airports to compete on a level playing field. We welcome
         this much delayed legislation and encourage the Minister to quickly
         introduce competition at Dublin airport by directing the construction of
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results - Amend
         a second and third competing terminals. This initiative will finally
         introduce competition, will result in lower prices, deliver better
         facilities, and bring millions more visitors to Ireland.
        "We have recently filed proceedings in the High Court in London for the
         recovery of overcharging on fuel levies by BAA plc, the monopoly
         operator of London's three major airports. The BAA has been charging a
         fuel levy since 1991, which was agreed at the time to recover the GBP12.5m
         cost of the fuel hydrant system. Since that date, thanks to Ryanair's
         enormous growth, BAA has recovered over GBP39m in fuel levies or more than
         three times the original cost and yet this extortionate levy remains
         unchanged. BAA have also issued Court proceedings arising out of the
         fuel levy dispute and we look forward to the Court's ruling on the BAA
         overcharging. Ryanair continues to oppose anti-consumer charges at these
         monopoly airports. It is untenable for the BAA airport monopoly to
         impose fuel levies in excess of 300% of cost on its low fare consumers,
         whilst at the same time providing free of charge car parking to
         politicians. This anti-consumer rip-off must end.
        "We continue to be cautious in our outlook for the remainder of the
         year. We expect to achieve passenger volume growth this fiscal year in
         the order of 20% and deliver increased load factors. We believe that
         yield attrition this winter will be within our forecast range of -10% to
         -20%. The reality is that the high cost, high fare airlines, and those
         so called low fare loss makers are unable to compete with Ryanair's low
         fares, low cost base and industry leading customer service. As Southwest
         has repeatedly demonstrated in the US for many years, the lowest cost
         carrier always wins."

exchange against the US$.
Staff costs have increased by 14% to EUR34.1m. This increase primarily reflects a
12% increase in average employee numbers to 2,444 and the impact of pay
increases of 3% granted during the period.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 2% to EUR23.6m. There are an additional
five 'owned' 737-800 aircraft in the fleet in Quarter 1 this year compared to
last year, however during the same period the company has retired six 737-200
aircraft. At the end of June the company operated 56 owned aircraft compared to
57 at the same time last year. The total operated fleet increased by 15 to 72
due to the purchase of five and the lease of ten 737-800's.
Fuel costs rose by 28% to EUR51.8m due to a 26% increase in the number of hours
flown, an increase in the average US$ cost per gallon of fuel offset by the
positive impact of the strengthening of the Euro to the US dollar during the
period.
Maintenance costs increased by 26% to EUR14.1m reflecting an increase in the size
of the fleet operated, and an increase in the number of hours flown offset by
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
maintenance savings due to improved reliability arising from the higher
proportion of 737-800 operated. In addition the introduction of ten aircraft
under operating lease has resulted in accruals for future overhaul costs being
recognised in maintenance costs. If the aircraft were owned, such costs would
instead be capitalised and amortised.
Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 5% to EUR7.3m due to the smaller
number of new routes launched in the period compared to last year. In addition
the advertising spend last year was significantly higher than normal due to the
acquisition of Buzz and the re-launch of its route network in May 2003.
Aircraft rental costs increased by EUR6.6m to EUR8.1m reflecting a full quarter of
costs associated with the acquired 'Buzz' aircraft and the lease of ten 737-800
aircraft which were delivered in the quarter to March 31, 2004.
Route charges increased by 32% to EUR33.2m due to an increase in the number
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in the
weight of the aircraft operated (which incur a higher charge), and the negative
impact of the strengthening of sterling against the Euro.
Airport and handling charges increased in line with passenger volume growth of
28% to EUR44.3m. The positive impact of lower charges on our new European routes
and bases was offset by the movement in the sterling/euro exchange rate in the
period.
Other expenses increased by 17% to EUR21.6m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on indirect costs.
Operating margins have remained very strong, in excess of 21%, due to the
reasons outlined above which has resulted in Operating profits increasing by 22%
to EUR64.8m during the quarter.
Interest receivable declined despite an increase in the level of cash and liquid
resources and highlights the lower deposit interest rates earned in the quarter
compared to last year. Interest payable increased by EUR1.6m due to the drawdown
of debt to part fund the purchase of new aircraft.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
The Company's Balance Sheet continues to strengthen due to the strong growth in
profits during the period. The Company generated cash from operating activities
of EUR155.9m, which funded additional capital expenditure of EUR60.5m, primarily
comprised of advance payments for future aircraft deliveries. Long term Debt
declined in the last quarter due to the repayment of EUR19.4m. No additional debt
was drawn down in the period. Cash and liquid resources continued to reflect the
strong trading performance of the company during the quarter and at June 30,
2004 stood at EUR1,327.0m compared to EUR1,257.4 at March 31, 2004.
Shareholders' Funds at June 30, 2004 have increased to EUR1,508.0m compared to
EUR1,455.3m at March 31, 2004.

Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 21% to EUR259.1m due to a combination of
increased passenger numbers on existing routes, the successful launch of new
bases at Rome-Ciampino and Barcelona-Girona, and the commencement of 7 new
routes in April '04, primarily offset by a 6% reduction in average fares. The
strong growth in passenger volumes is also reflected in the improvement in the
load factor achieved, which rose from 78% to 83% in the quarter.
Ancillary revenues increased by 40% to EUR43.7m, reflecting strong growth in
non-flight scheduled revenues, car rentals and other ancillary products.
Ancillary revenues continue to grow at a faster rate than passenger volumes and
accounted for 14% of total revenues during the period compared to 13% last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 24% to EUR238.0m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily maintenance, fuel, aircraft
rentals, route charges and airport and handling costs associated with the growth
of the airline. Increases in total operating expenses due to the higher level of
activity were partly offset by the positive impact of the strength of the euro
exchange against the US$.

TBI plc
("TBI" or "the Group")
AGM Statement
TBI, the regional airports operator, is holding its AGM today at 12 noon. At
the meeting, G Stanley Thomas, Chairman, made the following comments to
shareholders:
"The current year has got off to a positive start and trading remains in line
with the Board's expectations against the background of a continued challenging
environment for both our airline customers and for airport operators generally.
"Total passenger numbers from our core European airports have continued to grow
in the first quarter across all three passenger groups, full service, charter
and low cost, predominantly driven by low cost. Traffic across the total Group,
including our American airports, was 4.9m in the first quarter, 11% higher than
TBI PLC AGM Statement
last year. This trend has continued throughout July.
"TBI remains at the forefront of the growth in budget air travel and continues
to attract additional low cost traffic to domestic and European destinations.
Last week saw announcements from easyJet and Ryanair in which both low cost
operators committed to significant expansion of their respective services out of
London Luton. easyJet will increase its capacity by 25% by adding three new
aircraft and similarly Ryanair will add four new aircraft and nine new routes.
Such substantial expansion at London Luton is particularly pleasing and is clear
recognition of this airport's current and future potential. The benefit of the
extra volumes will be realised in 2006.
"As announced on Monday, 26 July, MyTravel's continuing restructuring will
result in reductions to its network at several UK airports including Cardiff
International. Unless replaced by other capacity this would result, in 2005/6,
in a 10% reduction in Cardiff's passenger numbers. Our team at Cardiff
International is already making good progress in this regard.
"Recently, the Board highlighted its intention to dispose of the Group's non
core airport assets in Bolivia and its airport services business in the US.
Advisers have been instructed to facilitate the divestment of the Group's
Bolivian operations and this process is now underway. Similarly, the sales
process for the US airport services business is progressing and we are now in
receipt of indicative bids from interested parties.
"TBI has entered the current year on a sound footing to move the business
forward and the Board remains optimistic about the future for the Group."
                                                                    30 July 2004

29 July 2004
                 RYANAIR ANNOUNCES NEW STAFF SHARE OPTIONS PLAN
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 29th July 2004)
confirmed a second grant on its share option scheme for all permanent staff.
Share options will average 20% of their pay at a strike price of EUR4.41. No
employee will receive less than EUR4,200.00 in this allocation. This is the second
tranche of shares issued to staff since the Company floated in 1997 and is
Revenue Commissioners approved and therefore qualifies for capital gains tax of
20%.
Since 1998, Ryanair's people have shared in the Company's success with over 30
million shares granted at a value of over EUR130M.
All qualifying staff at Ryanair will shortly receive information outlining their
share option value and the amount of allocated shares.
Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC New Staff Share Option
        "Although the European airline industry is enduring difficult times, all
         Ryanair's staff are working hard to ensure Ryanair provides the lowest
         fares and best customer service. We expect the very tough trading
         conditions to continue and be particularly difficult this coming winter.
         This new scheme reflects the current low share price and allows our
         people to share in future increases of the share price.
        "Ryanair continues to demonstrate its commitment to its people by
         providing rewarding careers with industry leading pay and conditions -
         this latest update to the staff share scheme is just the latest
         confirmation of our policy."

       "This year Ryanair will carry more than 27 million passengers who will
         save EUR2.7 billion over the high fares of other airlines.
       "With the addition of 8 new routes and three new great destinations we
         can bring even more choice to European consumers. It is notable that for
         the first time Ryanair's low fares will now be available in northern
         Spain, and in Latvia.
       "Seats for these flights at prices from only EUR3.99 are available for
        sale right now at Europe's biggest travel website - www.ryanair.com. -
        With lots of new exciting destinations there has never been a better or
        cheaper time to grab a bargain - so we would urge the passengers to book
        quickly as seats at these prices will be in huge demand".

Response to MyTravel announcement
TBI has today been notified by MyTravel of changes to its UK based charter
aircraft network. As part of these plans, MyTravel will be reducing its
services from Cardiff International with expected effect from the end of October
2004. These represent around one third of Cardiff International's charter
business which has remained steady for many years with continuing good
underlying demand.
The Board of TBI (the "Board") is confident that the majority of the c.320,000
holidaymakers potentially affected will still travel from Cardiff International.
Indeed, MyTravel has indicated to TBI that it intends to have an aircraft
operating from Cardiff International in Summer 2005. Making no allowance for
any further MyTravel traffic or any other replacement capacity, the Board
TBI PLC Re: MyTravel
believes the direct financial impact would be a reduction in profit before tax
of approximately GBP0.6 million for the financial year ending 31 March 2005 and
approximately GBP2.0 million for the year ending 31 March 2006.
MyTravel's operations from Belfast International, which accounted for 400,000
passengers in the year ended 31 March 2004, will not be affected. MyTravel has
only a very small presence at London Luton and this traffic will also be
continued.
Keith Brooks, Chief Executive of TBI, said today:
"Though disappointing, today's announcement by MyTravel reflects the difficult
 decisions being taken by this organisation as it continues to restructure.   TBI
 is currently talking to several airlines about additional traffic opportunities
 from Cardiff International and will take all steps possible to ensure passenger
 holiday flight demand is satisfied in full.
"As last week's announcements of significant new routes from London Luton by
easyJet and Ryanair demonstrate, TBI's airports continue to make good progress
benefiting from attractive catchment areas."

                RYANAIR FILES MONOPOLY ABUSE CASE AGAINST BAA PLC
Ryanair Holdings plc today (22 July 2004) announced that it had filed documents
this morning at the High Court in London alleging monopoly abuse of fuel levies
by BAA plc, dominant operators of London airports and owners of London Stansted
airport.
The BAA at Stansted built a fuel hydrant system in 1991 at an alleged cost of
GBP12.5m. BAA introduced a fuel levy charge, which was designed to recoup this
cost. Since then, the BAA has given repeated undertakings in writing that this
levy will be eliminated when the capital costs were recovered. BAA have broken
these agreements and to date BAA Stansted has, in a 14 year period, recovered
over GBP34m in fuel levies, three times the original cost.
Ryanair has a long history of opposing anti consumer charges by dominant or
monopoly airports. If there was competition between the three BAA owned London
Ryanair Holdings PLC RY files case against BAA
airports, this fuel levy scam would not exist.
We look forward to the Courts ending this price gouging by a dominant airport
operator on both low fare airlines and their passengers.
The company has for the past 12 months sought to negotiate reductions in the
fuel levy at London Stansted airport, which has resulted in overcharging for
many years.
Commenting on this rip off fuel levy, Howard Millar, Chief Financial Officer of
Ryanair said:
        "We can no longer allow the BAA to continue to charge GBP5m per annum in
         fuel levies to recoup the cost of a fuel hydrant system that was built
         14 years ago for GBP12.5m. The hydrant system has been paid for three
         times over and accordingly the fuel levy is a rip off overcharge.
         Arising from this legal action filed today, we anticipate a substantial
         reduction in the fuel levy in the order of GBP4m per annum.
        The company's existing airport charges agreement, which ends in 2007,
         will not be impacted by this legal action. The company's payments are
         current and until the rip off levy has been reduced, we will not agree
         to any increased charges at London Stansted airport."

Re: Expansion at London Luton
TBI, the regional airports operator, is delighted by the recent announcements
from low cost airlines, easyJet and Ryanair, regarding expansion at London
Luton. The Group continues to attract additional low-cost traffic as no-frills
travel to domestic and European destinations continues to grow.
Ryanair has today announced a significant increase to its services out of London
Luton with the addition of four new aircraft and 9 new European routes. Ryanair
currently operates 14 daily international flights from Luton to Dublin and
Milan. New international routes will be introduced to Girona, Reus, Dinard,
Esjberg, Murcia, Nimes, Venice, Rome and Stockholm.
easyJet has also announced the further expansion of its operations out of London
TBI PLC Expansion at London Luton
Luton recently with the addition of three more aircraft to the existing 13
currently in operation. This approximates to a 25% increase in easyJet capacity
based at London Luton. A minimum of three new routes will be added to its
existing network of 22 European destinations currently served out of London
Luton. Further details of these new destinations will be announced shortly.
TBI welcomes this significant endorsement from both Ryanair and easyJet of
London Luton's ongoing and future potential. However, while expansion of this
scale will have a positive impact on building passenger revenue, the extra
capacity will not be introduced until 2005 and therefore will have no material
impact on figures for the current financial year.

Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (19th July 04) confirmed that

Aer Lingus is still just another high fares airline.

Aer Lingus can manage is TWICE the price for the same route at EUR29.00.
Commenting today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
" When it comes to running a real seat sale, nobody beats Ryanair's fantastic
offers. Aer Lingus latest attempt is embarrassing - their lowest sale fare is a
wallet thumping TWICE THE PRICE compared to Ryanair's seat sale offers. Of

                          HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF!
               RYANAIR BEATS EASYJET PUNCTUALITY EVERY WEEK SO FAR IN 2004
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low-fares airline, today (Wednesday, 14th July 2004)
celebrated beating Easyjet for punctuality EVERY week of 2004 so far. But it
doesn't end there, in fact Ryanair's punctuality has beaten Easyjet every week
for over 18 months now.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
- In 2003, Ryanair beat Easyjet's punctuality 52 weeks out of 52 weeks!
- In 2004, Ryanair beat Easyjet's punctuality 28 weeks out of 28!
       "Easyjet can't match Ryanair's punctuality or Ryanair's prices. From May
        2003 to May 2004 our average fare was EUR40 while Easyjets was EUR62 - over
        50% higher than Ryanair. Easyjet is just another high fares airline,
        with awful punctuality and customer service - but then Ryanair's 27
        million passengers in 2004 already know that.
       "The traveling public are voting with their feet - when it comes to
        delivering low-fares and on-time flights no other airline can compete
        with Ryanair.

TBI's four European airports* handled a total of 3.83 million passengers during
the period from 1 April to 30 June 2004, an increase of 5.8% over the
corresponding period last year (2003: 3.62 million).
Growth was seen across all three passenger groups driven primarily by the low
cost sector which saw traffic increase by 7.7% to 2.8 million passengers (2003:
2.60 million). The full service segment saw an increase of 4.2% to 230,800
passengers boosted by an 11.2% increase at Cardiff. Charter was stable at
793,384 passengers.
On an airport-by-airport basis, the picture was slightly more variable. Luton
saw a 4.8% increase in total traffic to 1.86m driven by a 6.4% increase in
TBI PLC Q1 Traffic Statistics
low-cost and a 3.4% increase in full-service. Belfast has had an impressive
start to the year with passenger numbers up 8.9% driven by strong growth in both
the low-cost and charter segments, rising 9.8% and 6.9% respectively. In
contrast, Cardiff saw declines in both low-cost, down 9.6%, and charter, down
3.2%, but a 11.2% increase in full service as a result of a strong performance
from KLM's service to Amsterdam. Stockholm Skavsta again saw the greatest growth
of 21.35% as it continues to benefit from the growth of Ryanair's operations but
also through the addition of new services by Basiq Air which commenced in
February 2004.

          RYANAIR WELCOMES LEGISLATION TO BREAK UP AER RIANTA MONOPOLY
Ryanair, Europe's largest low fares airline this afternoon (Tuesday, 22nd June
2004) welcomed the publication of the State Airports Bill 2004 which will lead
to the break up of the Aer Rianta airport monopoly and allow some limited
competition between Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. Competition, even in this
limited form is to be welcomed and Ryanair believes that Cork and Shannon will
grow strongly now that they are free from the dead hand of Dublin Airport.
Welcoming this legislation today, Ryanair's Chief Executive, Michael O'Leary
said:
    "No one in Irish tourism should feel any regret at getting rid of the Aer
     Rianta monopoly or the Board that has run it so badly for the last 10 years.
     The present Board of Aer Rianta has proved an abject failure. Despite their
     doubling of airport charges, profits have collapsed from almost EUR40m in 1994
     to just EUR20m in 2003. They have missed out on the tourism explosion
     delivered by low fares airlines in Europe. They have been wildly profligate
     wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on facilities that the airlines
     didn't want and customers don't use at Dublin and Cork airports. They are
Ryanair Holdings PLC Welcomes Legislation
     responsible for third rate, third world airport facilities, ridiculous
     queues and car parks that are miles away from the terminal building. They
     have delivered a regime at Dublin Airport, which the Aviation Regulator
     previously confirmed was "50% more inefficient than the best of its peers".
     It's major contribution to Shannon has been to pollute the estuary for many
     years with raw sewage. This is also a Board which stood idly by and failed
     to implement its own contingency plan, while Ireland's main international
     airport was closed on two separate occasions earlier this year.
    However no one should be under any illusion that this legislation will be
     enough on its own to kick start Irish tourism. What we badly need is
     competing, independent terminals at Dublin Airport and we call on the
     Government to urgently implement the development of second and third
     competing terminals at Dublin. The Government received 13 separate
     expressions of interest for competing terminals as far back as 31 October
     2002. Almost 2 years have elapsed without progress and it is important that
     the new Dublin Airport Authority proceeds to implement this key commitment
     in the present Coalition's programme for Government.
    "A second (and third) competing terminals at Dublin Airport will kick start
     a revolution in Irish tourism and will create a minimum of 5,000 new jobs at
     Irish airports. If a low cost terminal is built, Ryanair will base another
     10 new aircraft here in Dublin, will open up a range of new low fare routes
     from Europe back into Ireland and will deliver an additional 5 million
     passengers annually for Irish tourism and employment.
    "Ryanair welcomes the publication of this legislation today, we welcome the
     demise of the failed and discredited Board of the Aer Rianta airport
     monopoly. We call on the Government to proceed urgently with the development
     of competing independent terminals at Dublin so that Irish consumers and
     Irish tourism can look forward to low cost, efficient airport facilities and
     an end to the era of third world, third rate facilities that this Aer Rianta
     monopoly has inflicted upon Irish tourism for the past 10 years."

                RYANAIR'S PUNCTUALITY BEATS THE BEST OF THE U.S.
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Monday, 21st June 2004)
celebrated beating the best of the U.S. airlines for punctuality in April 2004.
Not only is Ryanair the on-time performance leader of all the major European
Airlines each month, but also, according to the latest punctuality statistics
issued by the US Department of Transport, Ryanair has the best on-time
performance compared to all the other US airlines for April 2004.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "When it comes to punctuality, Ryanair leaves the best of the U.S.
         behind. We have out-preformed all the major U.S airlines in 2003 and
         this trend is continuing into 2004 with average overall punctuality for
         US airlines in April at 83% compared to Ryanair's 94% of flights on
         time. Not only is Ryanair the No 1 airline for low fares and punctuality
         in Europe, we are unbeatable for on-time performance, even when compared
         to the major US airlines."

                                        JAN-MAR 2004.
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Tuesday, 15th June 2004) was
confirmed the No. 1 major airline for punctuality by the UK Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA) for the 1st quarter of 2004.
The UK official statistics confirmed Ryanair No. 1 with 85% of Ryanair flights
arriving on time during January - March 2004. Recently released CAA annual
punctuality statistics also confirmed Ryanair the most punctual major airline
for 2003.
Commenting today, Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "Ryanair's unbeatable record for punctuality is continuing in 2004. The
         CAA official statistics for all of last year and this year so far
         confirm that Ryanair is the No.1 major airline when it comes to
         punctuality.
        "This year Ryanair will carry almost 28 million passengers on 149 routes
         across 16 European countries, and our passengers are benefiting from

RELEASE:
11TH JUNE 2004.
                RYANAIR BEATS EASYJET ON PUNCTUALITY EVERY MONTH
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (11th June 04) celebrated
beating Easyjet for punctuality every month of 2004 so far. The CAA recently
released official punctuality statistics for 2003 which confirmed Ryanair No.1
for punctuality and Easyjet barely scraping 8th place. The trend has continued
for 2004, with Ryanair beating Easyjet every month of the year so far.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
" Ryanair is Europe's No.1 on-time airline and that's official from the CAA.
Ryanair beat Easyjet in punctuality EVERY week of 2003 and so far EVERY week of
2004.
The message is clear for passengers - if you want Europe's lowest fares and
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair beats Easyjet
Europe's best on-time performance then fly with Ryanair. Easyjet is charging
consumers more for the privilege of being late.
This year Ryanair will carry more passengers than Easyjet, because only Ryanair
delivers the lowest fares and unbeatable on-time performance. That's why more
and more consumers choose Ryanair - almost 28Million of them this year!"

this review as our core business), will arise over a similar period.
Airlines directly generate just over half the turnover of our core business. We
term this type of revenue as aeronautical or traffic income as shown in the
segmental analysis in Note 1 to the financial information. In absolute terms it
represented GBP77.1m (2003: GBP76.5m) to our business, and an average of GBP4.40 per
passenger (2003: GBP5.04). This change in average aeronautical earnings per
passenger arose from the change in passenger mix between full service, low cost
and charter traffic. In the UK airports less than 7% of our traffic is now full
service in nature, a 35% decrease in percentage from last year. Yet this
reduction has been more than compensated for in terms of the number of
passengers carried by the low cost airlines increasing flown passengers at our
airports by some 2.6m over prior year levels across the Group. Passengers of
low cost airlines represented some 62% of our Group traffic in 2004.
Expansion of low cost traffic
Our airports exhibited tremendous growth of 31% in low cost traffic during the
year, of which some 82% was predominantly generated by three airlines - Ryanair
TBI PLC Final Results -2-
out of Stockholm Skavsta and London Luton, easyJet out of London Luton and
Belfast, and bmibaby out of Cardiff and Belfast. Looking at each in turn:
In April 2003 Ryanair launched its base at our smallest airport, Stockholm
Skavsta, more than trebling the number of passengers it carried to or from the
airport. The significant and overnight change of going from one route and no
based aircraft to six routes and three based aircraft is vividly apparent in the
activity levels of Stockholm Skavsta which increased by over 800,000 passengers,
almost 250%, over prior year levels. This development has cemented Stockholm
Skavsta's position as Stockholm's second airport. We are also encouraged to see
additional operators coming into the airport. In February 2004 Basiq Air
established a daily service to Rotterdam and in July 2004 Wizz Air will
establish services to Cracow and to Budapest. Stockholm Skavsta has
demonstrated that passengers know where it is and that it is definitely open for
business.
In London Luton, easyJet announced new services between London Luton and Berlin,
Dortmund and Budapest. Since some of these services were launched during the
latter part of this financial year and some were launched since the end of the
financial year, the full benefit is not yet reflected in Luton's numbers. In
addition, some existing routes benefited from additional rotations being added.
The increase in Ryanair passengers was simply a full year effect of the Bergamo
service which was launched in February 2003.
Belfast enjoyed over 20% growth in low cost traffic - of which the lion's share
was generated by bmibaby services. Since April 2004 easyJet has also announced
new international services to Paris, Nice, Alicante and Malaga - direct services
to continental Europe which the people of Northern Ireland have welcomed. This
continued growth has resulted in greater choice of destinations and frequency
which should allow us to claw back many of the 600,000 passengers from our
catchment area who currently fly out of Dublin.
bmibaby has made a significant difference to Cardiff - an extra 500,000
passengers compared with the previous year being the full year effect of the
TBI PLC Final Results -2-
services launched in November 2002.
Whilst the low cost airline passenger numbers went from strength to strength at
our airports, the full service traffic declined by a further 230,000 passengers
with most of the remaining full service passengers flying from our Bolivian
airports. We do not believe this position will change in the foreseeable
future.
Changes to airport traffic
Taken across the Group, charter traffic appears flat which masks the underlying
trend of a decline in charter traffic in the South East of England marginally
outweighed by almost 20% growth in Belfast. However, the difference in
aeronautical revenue per passenger in the South East from charter and low cost
is minimal.
As we have previously explained, different airlines use our airports in
different ways, and as a consequence pay us differently. Low cost airlines at
our airports expect, and manage, to turn around aircraft on the stand within 25
minutes. A full service airline may expect to be on stand for an hour or so,
and as a result we are able to handle more low cost passengers through a
constrained facility than we could handle full service passengers; this
increases the effective capacity of a terminal without additional capital
expenditure or revenue costs being triggered.
Commercial income
We earn approximately 40% of the turnover of our core business indirectly from
the passengers who travel through our airports - car parking, food and
beverages, retail outlets, car hire, foreign exchange outlets and their like all
operate at our airports and pay us a turnover based rental, which is usually
subject to a minimum guarantee.
The average passenger in our UK airports generates revenue of some GBP6.90 on a
round trip basis (2003: GBP6.61), a substantial proportion of which is derived
from car parking revenue and the remainder from the likes of retail spend,
catering and duty free.
TBI PLC Final Results -2-
Whilst the way in which we earn aeronautical revenues is very much driven by the
type of airline the passenger is flying on, the way in which we earn the
increasingly important commercial revenues is driven by the reason that the
passenger is travelling rather than their mode of transport. For example, a
business passenger behaves pretty much identically regardless of whether they
are flying on a low cost airline or on a full service airline.
Retailing and catering
Car parking represented some GBP22.3m (2003: GBP19.4m) of our Group turnover. Given
its commercial importance we decided to undertake a tendering process for car
park operators at London Luton Airport - a GBP14.0m business to us. We were
delighted to award the concession to NCP on the basis that they pay us a minimum
guarantee per passenger using the airport plus a profit share. This seemed
sensible as we take the variable element on passenger generation and NCP earn
the variable element of their success in pricing and attracting our passengers
into parking.
Duty free and duty paid shops are operated by concessionaires at all our
airports other than Stockholm Skavsta. These concessionaires, taken with our
shop in Sweden, generated rents which are generally based on the turnover of the
shop of GBP13.3m in 2003/4 compared with GBP11.5m in 2002/3, an increase of 16%.
Since the year end we have renewed some of the existing concessions at London
Luton and terminated others. We also expect to add to the retail offer at
Belfast during the forthcoming year and, for example, Boots the Chemist is
opening a new outlet there within the next month. At Stockholm Skavsta initial
signs are encouraging - the enlarged shop and improved passenger flows should
help increase penetration and spending levels.
Catering activities undertaken by concessionaires within the terminal buildings
generate approximately GBP4.9m of turnover. In the main there was little change
to catering arrangements or facilities across TBI in 2003/4. However at
Stockholm Skavsta catering facilities have been greatly extended and improved
with effect from April 2004.

Operational activities
Our industry continues to operate throughout a period of immense change in the
way that people travel and the technology evolves. We see that technology and
travelling passengers' increasing sophistication could fundamentally change the
way that the industry operates in sales and processing terms.
First and foremost we must operate a safe business. Our airports must comply
with the regulatory requirements of many bodies and authorities, overlaid with
our own in-house standards. Within that structure we must ensure that we meet
our airline customers needs for prompt turnaround times, that our passenger
customers are cared for, that our asset utilisation is optimised and that we not
only work hard but that we work smart and question what may always have been
accepted.
Again this year we have some tremendous examples of the TBI businesses operating
efficiently for all our audiences in sometimes challenging circumstances. In
Stockholm Skavsta we, overnight, almost doubled our staff and more than trebled
our passengers, and commenced a terminal extension programme which provided a
challenging and exciting year for our Swedish colleagues in every sense. We are
again proud that we were able to support local teams even with great demands
being made from elsewhere within the Group - support and advice being willingly
given and received. Our support team for Stockholm Skavsta drew upon people
from Cardiff, Luton, Belfast and Orlando - providing help in operational,
commercial and administrative areas. Between them all they have delivered a
first rate product which operates as a modern regional airport should.
Capital expenditure programmes during the year proceeded to plan. Mostly this
took the form of normal maintenance and investment - however a number of
projects were notable. In Sweden we completed the GBP7.9m project which had
straddled 2003 and 2004 - the extension of the old terminal building (with
capacity to handle less than 1m passengers) so as to enable it to handle over 2m
passengers comfortably. The end result is excellent - efficient and
customer-friendly. In London Luton we completed a new taxiway and three new
TBI PLC Final Results -2-
aircraft stands at a cost of some GBP7.0m. These works resulted in the taxiway
system at London Luton being tantamount to an enormous roundabout rather than
two culs de sac - with all the attendant efficiencies for us and our airline
customers. In Belfast the operations control centre was created which

seen us further strengthen our platform for growth. Within the context of a
continuingly tough environment, our core European airports remain well placed to
take advantage of the continued expansion in low cost travel, in particular, and
there is a clear indication of markedly improved trading across our US
businesses which is encouraging. We will also continue to focus on driving
revenue and managing costs."

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
This has been a satisfactory year for the Group which saw EBITDA* increase by
GBP0.7m, the completion of several important capital projects and the future
potential of our UK airports acknowledged in the Government's White Paper on
Aviation. While operating profit and profit before tax declined by GBP5.1m and
GBP5.0m respectively this is almost entirely due to the increased incidence of
exceptional items in the year, notably the GBP5.9m write down of goodwill in our
Airport Services business which was charged to profits in the first half of the
year.
I am pleased with this year's achievements as I believe they signal the
TBI PLC Final Results
beginning of a turn-around in the fortunes of the aviation industry in general
and TBI in particular. That said, the ongoing threat of geo-political risk or
the impact which a serious rise in oil prices could have on the industry cannot
be underestimated. Indeed, at the beginning of this financial year, the
industry and TBI felt the impact from the Iraq war and the SARS virus. But, for
TBI, I believe that the change in our customer base following the events of the
11th September 2001 and the associated structural changes in the industry is now
complete and, consequently, year on year comparisons have a greater validity.
The increase in EBITDA includes two components worthy of particular comment:
firstly the improved performances of our North American businesses. At Orlando
Sanford, EBITDA improved by 125% and Airport Services saw an 87% improvement on
the prior year. Secondly, the EBITDA loss of GBP1.7m incurred at Stockholm
Skavsta which was largely attributable to the cost of a significant amount of
operational transition for that business which saw passenger numbers increase
more than three-fold on an annualised-basis.
The Board is recommending maintaining the dividend. This represents a final
dividend of 1.60p to be paid on 1 October 2004 to shareholders on the register
at the close of business on 3 September 2004, bringing the total dividend for
the year to 2.30p per share.
December 2003 saw the publication of the Government's White Paper on the Future
of Aviation in the United Kingdom up to 2030. In that paper, the Government
provided the strategic direction for all three of our UK airports to expand.
London Luton was effectively given the go-ahead to increase passenger numbers to
31 million and Belfast to eight or nine million from the current year numbers of
seven million and four million respectively. In the context of Cardiff, the
White Paper was drawn up in conjunction with the Welsh Assembly Government and
affirmed Cardiff as the principal airport in Wales, effectively ending
speculation regarding new airport developments at Newport or Severnside which
was particularly pleasing.
Our UK Airports are all well placed to take advantage of the Government's
TBI PLC Final Results
direction and future strategy for aviation.
At London Luton, new services have been introduced to Berlin, Dortmund, Budapest
and Katovice. To accommodate and facilitate this passenger growth we invested
some GBP7m during the year at this location to build a new taxiway and three new
aircraft stands capable of accommodating large aircraft. The executive jet
market also continues to flourish and in recent months has demonstrated growth
considerably in excess of 20%.
Passenger numbers at Belfast International exceeded four million for the first
time through substantial increases of approximately 20% in both the holiday
charter and low cost operations. I am also particularly pleased to record that
Belfast International has made significant inroads into the continental European
market with scheduled flights to Prague, Paris, Nice, Alicante and Malaga. This
means that for the first time passengers from Northern Ireland will be able to
take direct flights to continental Europe. Such a facility is long overdue and
I am optimistic that there is more to come. Again we have invested, and will be
investing in future, to accommodate this growth. During the year impressive new
catering facilities were completed and a major refurbishment of the duty free
shop, incorporating a 5,000 sq.ft. extension to the terminal, is planned for
December 2004.
Cardiff also saw growth in activity with passenger numbers increasing to almost
two million. This growth was all achieved from low cost services, but
significantly the level of charter business was also maintained. Capital
improvements included extensions to the departure lounge and the security check
area, as well as the construction of a new business lounge. An important
development to the growth of the airport will be the opening of a railway
station near to the airport in May 2005.
When remarking on capital projects, it would be remiss not to make special
mention of Stockholm Skavsta. A major extension to the terminal was
substantially completed in the year and the airport can now comfortably handle
the 1.1m passengers that currently use it, and has the capacity to accommodate
TBI PLC Final Results
three times that number.
At Orlando Sanford, the British are returning and UK traffic increased by 21%
during the year, but perhaps even more significantly Sanford is making its mark
with the American domestic passenger. Almost 600,000 US passengers used the
airport last year, an increase of 67%.
Overall we have seen a cautious improvement, but one certainly moving in the
right direction and with the right platforms in place to take the business
forward. In addition to the infrastructure I have mentioned, those
springboards, of course, also include the Group's people. We have great teams
in each of the business entities and they have again performed very well this
year. Thanks to them, the TBI executive team led by Keith Brooks, and also my
fellow non-executive directors, including Tim Simon who retired during the year.
We are making good progress in finding a replacement.
The improvements made this year have encouraged me and that view is supported by
activity levels in the first two months of the new financial year where
passenger numbers are more than 11% higher than for the corresponding two months
in 2003. The growth is apparent, without exception, at all our airports and
includes all types of service: low cost by 10%, charter by 13% and full service
by 12%. Whilst passenger numbers are holding up well and we are involved in a
number of significant route development initiatives, we continue to see pressure
on yields.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Introduction
Our strategy remains consistent: to be an operator of regional airports where we
can make a difference. To the extent that our existing businesses do not fall
TBI PLC Final Results
within that definition shareholders should expect to see divestments over the
next 12 to 18 months. We are also optimistic that opportunities to expand the

                     RYANAIR ANNOUNCES ANNUAL PROFITS OF EUR227m
                      A NET MARGIN OF 21%, AS TRAFFIC GROWS 47%
    Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline today (1 June 2004) announced
     better than forecast financial results for the full year ended 31 March
     2004. Annual passenger traffic grew by a record 47% to over 23m. This growth
     was driven by significantly lower fares. Yields declined by 14% during the
     full year and consequently total revenues rose by 28% to over EUR1 billion for
     the first time. Unit costs during the year were reduced by 6% with the
     result that total operating costs rose by 39%, significantly less than the
     rate of traffic growth. Ryanair's adjusted after tax profit margin fell from
     an exceptional 28% last year to an industry leading 21%, and adjusted
     profits for the year have fallen by 5% to EUR226.6m. Contrary to our earlier
     fears, our adjusted profit in the final quarter marks our 28th consecutive
     profitable quarter since Ryanair first floated in May 1997.

     Ryanair do in both good times and bad. This year was characterised by
     adverse market conditions including Sterling weakness, the war in Iraq, the
     threat of terrorist attacks, significantly higher oil prices, and intense
     price competition all over Europe from chronically loss making flag and new
     entrant carriers, most of whom are losing money on an enormous scale.
     Despite these challenges Ryanair has significantly lowered fares for our
     customers, carried over 23 million passengers, still maintained a world
     leading after tax profit margin of over 20% and ended the year with over
     EUR1.2 billion in cash.
    These results cover a year during which we achieved many new milestones
     including;
1. Opening two new bases in Rome Ciampino and Barcelona Girona.
2. Launching 73 new routes, boosting the network to 150.
3. Taking delivery of 18 new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.
4. Acquiring Buzz Stansted Ltd.
5. Carrying 2 million passengers in one month (July'03) for the first time.
6. Overtaking British Airways traffic in the UK/Europe market.
7. Becoming the No.1 on-time major airline in Europe.
    "Our two new bases in Rome Ciampino and Barcelona Girona are performing
     extremely well and current bookings indicate that load factors at both bases
     will exceed 85% throughout the Summer period. Ryanair continues to be the
     lowest cost airline in Europe and we will continue to exploit this enormous
     cost leadership to grow profitably while many of our competitors lose money
     and/or go out of business.
    "It remains our medium term view that (similar to Southwest in the U.S.)
     there will only be one or possibly two large low fares airlines in Europe
     and we are determined that the biggest and lowest cost of these carriers
     will be Ryanair. Others who have higher cost or higher fare models will have
     to endure losses or switch capacity away from head to head competition with
     Ryanair (such as Aer Lingus on many Ireland-UK Provincial routes and more
     recently BmiBaby and EasytJet on the East Midlands-Barcelona route), because
     their higher cost base makes them unable to compete with Ryanair's low
     fares.
    "There will continue to be regulatory battles, such as those in Strasbourg
     and Charleroi but these will prove to be temporary obstacles. The growth of
     competition, choice and low fare air travel in Europe is unstoppable. As
     more and more airports compete to win our business, costs will fall, because
     the existing competition rules allow publicly owned airports to compete on a
     level playing field with privately owned airports. We remain confident that
     we will ultimately win both of our appeals on the Strasbourg and Charleroi
     cases. The need for Ryanair's low fares has been highlighted by the damage
     done at Strasbourg Airport where Air France's high fares has caused traffic
     on the London route to collapse from almost 20,000 to just 3,000 a month,
     immediately following Ryanair's temporary withdrawal.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Results
    "A lot of hysteria has been generated in recent weeks about higher oil
     prices. We believe the growth of low fare air travel will not be damaged or
     slowed by higher oil prices, which will only hasten the demise of some of
     the current wave of loss making start-ups and high fare flag carriers. The
     recent decision by British Airways, Air France and KLM, among others to
     impose fuel surcharges is typical of the anti-consumer mindset of high fares
     airlines. Whilst we are almost fully hedged till the end of Q.2, we are
     largely unhedged thereafter, as it would be unwise to lock in at the current
     high forward rates. Our view is that prices will fall this Winter, or next
     year and only then will we hedge, in order to benefit from such reductions.
     Unlike some high fare carriers Ryanair by contrast will absorb higher oil
     prices by making cost savings in other areas. We will not impose fuel
     surcharges on our customers, and have little doubt that our traffic will
     continue to thrive as a result of higher price differentials between Ryanair
     low fares and those of our surcharging competitors.
    "Our outlook for the coming 12 months remains very conservative. We expect
     strong traffic passenger growth of circa 20%. Our seat capacity will rise by
     just 16% this year as Buzz Stansted has been unable to agree reasonable
     lease terms with ILFC and due to this uncertainty these aircraft (which are
     presently operated by Buzz Stansted under contract to Ryanair) have been
     removed from Ryanair's forthcoming Winter schedule. Current load factors are
     higher than this time last year, which confirms our view that we will have
     no problems filling our fleet of larger 189 seat aircraft once the
     exceptional capacity growth of last year returns to a more normal 20% rate.
     We continue to expect yields to decline. With almost 50% of the seats booked
     for the Summer season, the yield attrition seems to be towards the lower end
     of our forecast range at -5% to -10%, but next Winter, as many of our loss
     making competitors dump prices to try to stay alive, we expect the yield
     declines to increase within a range of -10% to -20%. There will be more
     airline casualties next Winter, a process that has already started in recent
     months with the closure of four airlines in Ireland, the UK and Scandinavia.
    "The European consumer has repeatedly shown over the past 20 years that they
     support Ryanair. In every country and in every marketplace, Ryanair provides
     the lowest fare air travel with the best punctuality, the best customer
     service, on brand new 737-800 series aircraft from uncongested, easy to use
     local airports. We intend over the coming years to lower prices further as
     we grow our traffic to over 50 million passengers per annum and in doing so
     making Ryanair Europe's largest international scheduled airline. Over the
     past 12 months over 23 million passengers saved an average of just over EUR100
     each by choosing Ryanair over our competitors. We look forward to doubling
     these savings for European consumers over the coming four years."

                  Management Discussion and Analysis of Results
Introduction
For the purposes of the MD&A all figures and comments are by reference to the
adjusted profit and loss account excluding the non-recurring costs, and goodwill
referred to below.
Non-recurring costs consisted of re-organisation costs of EUR2.7(net of tax),
additional depreciation charge of EUR3.3m relating to an adjustment to the
residual value of six Boeing 737-200 aircraft that were retired earlier than
planned (see Note 4), which in turn gave rise to lease costs of EUR11.6m(net of
tax). Goodwill of EUR2.3m arising from the "Buzz" acquisition was amortised during
the period. Total non-recurring costs and goodwill amounted to EUR19.9m (net of
tax).
The adjusted Net Profit for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR3.5m reflecting a
22% reduction in average fares.
Summary - Year ended March 31, 2004
Profit after tax has decreased by 5% to EUR226.6m, compared to EUR239.4m in the
previous year driven by continued strong growth in passenger volumes and tight
cost control, offset by fares, which were on average 14% lower. Operating
margins for the year also decreased by 6 points to 25%, however despite this
reduction Operating profit increased by 3% to EUR270.9m compared to year ended
March 31, 2003.
Total operating revenues for the year grew by 28% to EUR1,074.2m whilst passenger
volumes increased by 47% to 23.1m.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 26% to EUR924.6m due to strong passenger
growth, offset by a 14% decline in average fares during the year to EUR39.97.
Passenger volumes increased due to the launch of new routes and bases, increased
capacity on our existing routes and the acquisition of Buzz during April 2003.
Passenger load factors decreased, as expected by 4 percentage points from 85% to

non-flight scheduled revenue, car hire and hotel revenue, offset, by the
cessation of the charter programme as Ryanair replaced charter capacity with
scheduled services. Ancillary revenues were also negatively impacted by the
strength of the euro currency versus sterling, as 65% of ancillary revenues are
denominated in sterling. Ancillary revenue, excluding charters increased by 52%,
higher than the growth in passenger numbers, and accounted for 14% of total
revenues compared to 13% in fiscal '03.
Total operating expenses increased by 39% to EUR803.4m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs, primarily fuel, route charges and airport
& handling costs associated with the growth of the airline. Costs increased at a
lower rate than the growth in passenger numbers principally reflecting the
increased operational efficiencies arising from the higher proportion of 737-800
aircraft operated. However costs have increased at a faster rate than the growth
in revenues due to the decline in fares as described above.
Other income/expenses declined significantly by EUR21.5m due to the combination of
lower deposit interest rates, and higher interest payable arising from the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Results -4-
increased level of debt during the year.
Net Profit margins have as a result of above declined from 28% to 21% whilst Net
Profit decreased by 5% to EUR226.6m.
Adjusted earnings per share has decreased by 6% to 29.91 euro cent.
Balance Sheet
Cash and Liquid Resources have increased from EUR1,060.2m at March 31, 2003 to
EUR1,257.4m at March 31, 2004, reflecting the increased cash flows from the
profitable trading performance during the year offset by expenditure in respect
of the aircraft acquisition programme. Eighteen additional aircraft were
delivered, nine in the last quarter. Ten aircraft were financed under operating
lease agreements and the remaining eight aircraft were financed via debt.
Aircraft purchases in addition to aircraft deposits accounted for the bulk of
the EUR331.6m incurred in capital expenditure. This was part funded by the draw
down of long term debt in relation to eight aircraft, which increased, net of
repayments, by EUR115.8m during the year. Shareholders' Funds at March 31, 2004
have increased to EUR1,455.3m, compared to EUR1,241.7m at March 31, 2003.
Detailed Discussion and Analysis - Year ended March 31, 2004
Profit after tax has decreased by 5% to EUR226.6m driven by strong growth in
passenger volumes and continued tight cost control, offset by a 14% reduction in
average fares. Net margins as a result have decreased by 7 points to 21% from
28% in the comparative period.
Total operating revenues increased by 28% to EUR1,074.2m whilst passenger volumes
increased by 47% to 23.1m.
Scheduled passenger revenues increased by 26% to EUR924.6m primarily due to
increased passenger numbers on new and existing routes, offset by a 14%
reduction in average fares. The reduction in average fares was most pronounced
in quarter 4 during which they fell 22%. The weakness of the sterling exchange
rate to the euro accounted for 4% of the 14% decline in average fares.
Ancillary revenues increased by 35% to EUR149.7m. Non Charter revenues (the
charter programme ceased in quarter 4 last year) increased by 52% during the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Results -4-
year, and reflects strong performance in non-flight scheduled revenues, car hire
revenues, and internet related revenues. Overall ancillary revenues have
increased to 14% of total revenues compared to 13% last year.
Total operating expenses increased by 39% to EUR803.4m due to the increased level
of activity, and the increased costs primarily fuel, route charges and airport &
handling costs associated with the growth of the airline. The weakness of
sterling to the euro had a positive impact on operating costs as did the
efficiencies arising from the increased proportion of 737-800 aircraft in
operation.
Staff costs have increased by 33% to EUR123.6m. This increase reflects a 31%
increase in average employee numbers to 2,288 and the impact of a 3% pay
increase granted during the year offset by savings arising from the stronger
euro to sterling exchange rate. Productivity calculated on the basis of
passengers booked per employee continues to improve, with an increase of 21% to
10,049 passengers being achieved during the year.
Depreciation and amortisation increased by 28% to EUR98.1m due to an increase in
the number of aircraft owned from 54 to 62 and the amortisation of capitalised
maintenance costs offset by savings arising from the base cost of all 737-200
aircraft now having been fully depreciated. This incorporates a charge of EUR4.4m
reflecting the reduction in the residual value of fifteen 737-200 aircraft to a
residual value of EUR0.5m each.
Fuel costs rose by 36% to EUR175.0m due to a 58% increase in the number of hours
flown, offset by lower US$ cost per gallon, a stronger euro to US$ exchange rate
and an improvement in the fleet fuel burn rate due to a higher proportion of
737-800 aircraft operated.
Maintenance costs increased by 46% to EUR43.4m reflecting an increase in the size
of the fleet operated, an increase in the number of flight hours, and higher
maintenance charges relating to the "Buzz" aircraft, offset by maintenance
savings due to improved reliability arising from the higher proportion of
737-800 aircraft operated as a percentage of the total fleet. In addition the
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Results -4-
entry into operation of ten aircraft under operating lease has resulted in
provisions for future overhaul costs being recognised in maintenance costs. This
policy is different for aircraft owned by the company when such maintenance
costs are capitalised and amortised.
Marketing and distribution costs increased by 10% to EUR16.1m due to a higher
spend on the promotion of new routes, and the launch of two new bases at
Barcelona, and Rome in the last quarter.
Aircraft rental costs of EUR11.5m arose during the year reflecting the lease
rental costs associated with the acquired "Buzz" aircraft and the lease of 10
737-800 aircraft, 9 of which were delivered during quarter 4.
Route charges increased by 61% to EUR110.3m due to an increase in the number of
sectors flown, an increase in the average sector length and an increase in the
size of the aircraft operated which incur a higher charge offset by the impact
of a weaker sterling to euro exchange rate.
Airport and handling charges increased by 36% to EUR147.2m due to an increase in
the number of passengers flown, and the impact of increased airport and handling
charges on some existing routes, offset by lower charges on our new European
routes.
Other expenses increased by 31% to EUR78.0m, which is less than the growth in
ancillary revenues due to improved margins on some new and existing products,
and cost reductions achieved on other indirect overheads.
Operating profits have increased by 3% to EUR270.9m during the year despite the
decline in Operating margins to 25% due to the reasons outlined above.
Interest receivable decreased by EUR7.5m to EUR23.9m reflecting the strong growth in
cash resources arising from the profitable trading performance, offset by
reductions in deposit interest rates during the year. Interest payable increased
by EUR16.7m to EUR47.6m due to the increased level of debt arising from the purchase
of nine 'next' generation 737-800 aircraft.
Foreign exchange gains arose primarily due to the conversion of sterling and US$
bank balances to euro at the year end, plus the conversion of foreign currency
Ryanair Holdings PLC Annual Results -4-
receivable and payable balances.
Taxation has declined by 5% during the year, in line with the decline in pre tax
profits.
The Company's Balance Sheet is benefiting from the continued generation of
profits. Tangible fixed assets increased to EUR1,576.5m from EUR1,352.4m principally
as a result of the purchase of eight additional aircraft since March 31, 2003
and the payment of deposits for future deliveries. Advance delivery deposits
amounted to EUR327.1m at the year-end. The Company generated cash from operating
activities of EUR450.2m, which funded all advance payments on future deliveries
whilst the balance is reflected in the higher cash and liquid resources figure
of EUR1,257.4m. Total Debt has increased by a further EUR115.8m, net of repayments,
since March 31, 2003 to EUR953.0m. Shareholder's Funds at March 31, 2004 have
increased to EUR1,455.3m compared to EUR1,241.7m at March 31, 2003.
Notes to the Financial Statements
1.Accounting Policies
        The accounting policies followed in the preparation of the above
         preliminary announcement document for the year ended March 31, 2004 are
         consistent with those set out in the Annual Report for the year ended
         March 31, 2003. The statutory financial statements for the year to March
         31, 2004 will be finalised on the basis of the financial information
         presented by the directors in this preliminary announcement and,
         together with the auditors' report thereon, will be delivered to the
         Register of Companies following the group's annual general meeting.
2.Approval of the Preliminary Announcement
        The Board of Directors approved this preliminary announcement document,
         which will form the basis of the groups consolidated financial
         statements for the year ended March 31, 2004, on May 27, 2004.
3.Generally Accepted Accounting Policies
        The Management Discussion and Analysis of Results for the Year ended
         March 31, 2004 are based on the results reported under Irish and UK
         GAAP.
4.Aircraft retirement costs
        Six aircraft (five in Q2, one in Q3) were retired earlier than expected
         due to the detection during the period of scratch marks ('scribing')
         that occurred during an aircraft painting programme on these aircraft in
         1995. It has been determined that the cost of repairing these aircraft
         is uneconomic due to the short remaining life of the aircraft.

          Accordingly the Company has determined that the residual value of US$1m
         (EUR794k) for these aircraft is excessive and as a result has reduced it
         to EUR250k per aircraft. The cost of this adjustment has been reflected in
         the results for Quarter 2 and 3.
        As a result of these early retirements the Company has been obliged to
         lease in seat capacity during the period to enable it to continue its
         normal flight schedule. The charge in the year of EUR13.3m is reflected in
         Aircraft retirement costs. As planned the Company has terminated these
         rentals prior to March 31, 2004.

AER RIANTA INCOMPETENTCY WITNESSED AGAIN - EUR7MILLION SPENT ON 'PIER D' AND A NOT
                                 A SHOVEL LIFTED.
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (Thursday, 27th May 2004) called
on the Government to proceed immediately with the planned break-up of the
inefficient Aer Rianta monopoly. Aer Rianta monopoly has announced it has wasted
a mind blowing EUR7million of tax payers money on the planned Pier D when not a
single sod has been turned.
This latest evidence of total incompetence comes hours after Aer Rianta
announced profit collapse of 50%, despite airport charges having doubled,
car-parking prices tripled, and passenger numbers more than doubling during the
10 year mismanagement of the current Aer Rianta board by Chairman, Noel Hanlon.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons, said:
"Yesterday, Aer Rianta announced a write-off of an incredible EUR7 million (of tax
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Rianta Incompetentcy
payers money) on the gold-plated Pier D plans, when not a single blade of grass
has been touched.
What exactly was the EUR7 million spend on?
   Consultants reports?
    Fancy architects?
    Engineering meetings?
    Expensive lunches?
    Lobbying?
    Or was it on Noel Hanlon's PR Consultants?
The tax payers of this country are entitled to an explanation and we are calling
on the Department of Transport to immediately publish detailed analysis of how
exactly one can ratchet-up EUR7 million of tax payers money without a single hole
being dug".

                           AER RIANTA'S POOR RESULTS
                        HIGHLIGHT THE FAILURE OF MONOPOLY
                           AND THE NEED FOR COMPETITION
                                AT DUBLIN AIRPORT
This afternoon (Wednesday, 26th May 2004) Aer Rianta will release its (already
leaked) financial results for 2003, and these again highlight the failure of the
Aer Rianta airport monopoly and the urgent need for competition at Dublin
Airport. These results which mark the last full year under the mismanagement of
Chairman, Noel Hanlon, prove that the Aer Rianta airport monopoly is lagging
behind its industry peer airports by failing to attract low fare traffic growth
(like London Stansted airport), and by failing to control costs which has
decimated its profitability.
1.Traffic Growth
During the past 5 years (1999-2003) traffic at Dublin Airport has grown at a
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Riantas Poor Results
compound annual rate of just 6% compared to 26% for London Stansted, Ryanair's
other main base. This woeful rate of growth at a time of unparalleled economic
prosperity in Ireland lags way behind the traffic growth delivered at comparable
airport peers such as London Stansted, London Luton (15%), Liverpool (31%) and
Glasgow Prestwick (26%), all of whom have stimulated rapid low fare traffic
growth with low fare carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
                        Annual Rate of Traffic Growth
                Aer Rianta Dublin                       London Stansted
                       1999            +9%        98/99                +35%
                        2000            +8%        99/00                +33%
                        2001            +4%        00/01                +23%
                        2002            +5%        01/02                +14%
                        2003            +5%        02/03                +19%
                       Average           6%                              25%
The reason why the Aer Rianta monopoly has failed to deliver significant traffic
growth at Dublin Airport is because it has spent the last five years increasing
costs to the airlines and passengers (whilst other airports are reducing prices)
and at the same time wasting hundreds of millions of pounds building unnecessary
gold-plated facilities (like EUR80m on Pier D & EUR140m at Cork Airport).
2.Profitability
These declining profits prove once again just how inefficient and mismanaged the
Aer Rianta airport monopoly is. The Irish Aviation Regulator two years ago
declared Aer Rianta to be "50% more inefficient than the best of its peer
airports".
During the 10 year period of the present Board's mismanagement;
   actual charges paid by the airlines at Dublin have more than doubled,
    carparking charges suffered by consumers have more than tripled and,
    traffic at Dublin has doubled from 6.9m in 1994 to 15.9m in 2003,
    yet annual profits have halved
Airline users at Dublin Airport now pay the highest actual charges than at any
midsized airport in Europe. These high charges have deterred quantum growth in
low fare air traffic, as the Aer Rianta monopoly has repeatedly rejected
Ryanair's offers to double traffic at Dublin Airport and has failed to attract
other large low fare, high growth airlines such as Easyjet. During this decade
despite charges to the airlines having doubled, the daily cost of carparking to
Ryanair Holdings PLC Aer Riantas Poor Results
passengers having trebled and profits at the airport monopoly have collapsed
from EUR40m in 1994 to EUR20m in 2003. Aer Rianta's net profit margin during Noel
Hanlon's Chairmanship has collapsed from 16% in 1994 when he joined the Board to
just 4.5% in 2003. During the same period profits at the BAA operated airports
rose by over 50% from GBP240m to GBP374m.
      Year               Aer Rianta                             BAA Plc
                          Profits EUR        Margin         Profits GBP     Margin
      1994                EUR37.5m            16%           GBP240m         21%
       2003                EUR20.0m             4%           GBP374m         20%
There is only one solution to this monopoly mess and that is competition. The
Government has been promising legislation in competing terminals at Dublin
Airport for over two years now. Every deadline made by Bertie Ahern's Government
has been missed, meanwhile the Aer Rianta airport monopoly has been doubling
costs to users, failing to control costs and as a result both profits and
margins have collapsed. These shocking results prove it's time that this
Government finally proceeded with a competing second terminal at Dublin and put
an end forever to the inefficiency and incompetence of the Aer Rianta airport
monopoly.

    RYANAIR LAUNCH APPEAL AGAINST COMMISSION'S FLAWED DECISION ON CHARLEROI
Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (25th May 2004) confirmed that
it had filed its appeal against the Commission's decision in the Charleroi case
to the European Court of First Instance requesting the Court to annul this
flawed decision. The Commission wrongly found that certain elements of Ryanair's
arrangements with Brussels Charleroi Airport were illegal state aid.
The Commission's decision completely ignored the fact that the agreement between
Ryanair and the airport arose after intense negotiations with several other
airports. Ryanair also confirmed that it has similar and in fact lowercosts at
private airports. Under the state aid rules, a public airport must be able to
compete on a level playing field with private airports and to offer the same
conditions. The Commission's decision in Charleroi ignored these lower cost
agreements and will prevent public airports from competing on a level playing
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Launch Appeal
field for new routes and passenger growth and will lead to less low fares,
competition and choice for European consumers.
The Commission's investigation was initiated following an "anonymous" complaint,
widely believed to by the monopoly main airport, Brussels Zaventem, in a bid to
limit competition from Brussels Charleroi, and has been backed up by such high
fares airlines as Air France and their high fares association the AEA.
Commenting today on its appeal to the European Courts, Ryanair's Chief
Executive, Michael O'Leary, said:
        "It is unfortunate that after having successfully liberalised the market
         for air transport, which ushered in an era of unprecedented competition
         and low fares for consumers, the European Commission now appears to be
         playing into the hands of the struggling, former monopoly national
         airlines and monopoly hub airports, to protect them from competition.
        Ryanair has pioneered the low fares model of offering direct
         point-to-point low fare air services to and from underutilised regional
         and secondary airports all over Europe. This has enabled us to offer
         fares at a fraction of what the high fare, rip-off airlines have been
         forcing on consumers for years. Ryanair's partnership with these
         airports has been good for the airports, good for Ryanair and, most of
         all, good for consumers.
        Now that Ryanair has become a major competitive threat to the dinosaur
         national airlines and monopoly airports, they have begun to misuse the
         state aid rules and use other dirty tricks to prevent competition and
         raise fares to consumers. It is a pity that the European Commission has
         allowed itself to be used to prevent competition and to place at risk
         the very successful partnership between low fares airlines and regional
         airports.
        The Commission's flawed decision in Charleroi has been heavily
         criticised by the Forum of European Regional Airports (FARE), the
         European Low Fares Airline Association (ELFAA), the Assembly of European
         Regions (AER) and consumers - all concerned about the negative precedent
         this decision creates for European regional airports and the regions
         they serve.
        We are therefore calling on the European Court to overturn this flawed
         and anti-competitive decision on the following grounds:
   The Commission failed to apply the Market Economy Investor Principle
     (MEIP), which is the test for proving that a public company was acting in
     the same way as a private investor would have in the same circumstances.
   The Commission ignored factual evidence that the Charleroi agreement
     resulted from negotiations with several other airports.
   The Commission ignored the fact that the deal was specifically offered to
     other airlines willing to make the same investment in the airport that
     Ryanair did.
   The Commission ignored the fact that Ryanair demonstrated that it had
     lowercosts at several private airports.
   The Commission ignored the huge growth in passengers, profitability and
     value of the airport as a result of Ryanair's investment in the airport
     (roughly EUR200 million).
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Launch Appeal
   The Commission ignored the fact that other airlines, commercial retailers
     and airport investors are now approaching Brussels Charleroi Airport as a
     result of Ryanair's successful operations at the airport.
The Commission's decision is therefore seriously flawed and creates a very
damaging precedent for underutilised regional airports all over Europe. High
Fares airlines like Air France and Alitalia are already using this flawed
decision to undermine competition elsewhere in Europe.
We are confident that this decision will be overturned by the European Court and
that the successful partnership between low fares airlines and regional airports
will be vindicated."

                             MAJOR SCHEDULED AIRLINE
Ryanair, Europe's No.1 low fares airline, today (24th May 04) was confirmed by
official UK CAA statistics as the most punctual major scheduled airline serving
the UK for the full year 2003.
The CAA 2003 statistics show Ryanair AS No.1 for punctuality, with 81% of all
flights on-time in 2003. British Airways lagged behind in 4th place with over 2
of every 10 flights delayed and Easyjet in 8th place with more than 3 in every
10 flights delayed.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
"The official CAA statistics for 2003 confirms what 28 million passengers this
year already know - that when it comes to lowest fares and on-time flights
no-one beats Ryanair.
Ryanair Holdings PLC CAA confirms Ryanair No.1
So if you want to save money, and get there on time - fly Ryanair, Europe's No.1
on-time airline."

Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 low fares airline, today (Friday, 21st May 2004)
criticised BA's latest attempt to rip-off consumers with high fares to France
and Italy - fares that are an incredible SIX times more expensive than
Ryanair's.
Ryanair's Head of Communications, Paul Fitzsimmons said:
        "BA's latest 'offer' is a joke! They are continuing to price gouge
         consumers with their ridiculously high fares. The public already knows
         BA's fares are a rip-off. BA can't match Ryanair's low fares and can't
         match Ryanair's punctuality record and customer service.
        "BA's latest offering to the South of France start at a wallet busting
         GBP179.00, almost SIX TIMES HIGHER than Ryanair's low fare to South
         France, from GBP30 return! BA's fares to Italy - from GBP189 - are MORE THAN
         SIX TIMES HIGHER than Ryanair's from just GBP30 return.
        "This year Ryanair will carry 28 million passengers on 151 routes across
         16 European countries. It's no wonder millions of consumers are voting
         with their feet and choosing Ryanair's unbeatable value to South of

         Ryanair".
