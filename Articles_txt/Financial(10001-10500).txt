 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said in a regulatory filing Tuesday it is looking to restart flying about 40% of its normal 
flights, or nearly 1,000 flights, from July 1.
The new schedule would see an increase in the number of flights from the current 30 since the beginning of 
lockdowns in March and the carrier plans to start flying from most of its 80 bases across Europe and restore 90% of 
its pre-COVID-19 route network.
The plans depend on relaxation of government restrictions on intra-EU flights and implementation of effective health 
measures at airports.
Shares of the company were up nearly 2% in recent Tuesday trading.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) is looking to restore 40% of its scheduled flights from July 1 following lockdowns across 
Europe to limit the spread of COVID-19.
The measure is subject to government restrictions on European flights being lifted and "effective public health 
measures" implemented in airports, according to a Tuesday filing.
The budget airline said the move would involve nearly 1,000 flights per day, restoring 90% of its pre-COVID-19 
route network. It would also require cabin crew and passengers to wear face masks and pass temperate checks.

May 12, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  BANGKOK (AP) — World shares 
were mostly higher on Tuesday as countries gradually lifted restrictions on business and public life, though worries 
over fresh outbreaks of coronavirus cases persisted. Optimism over plans for reopening in many countries after 
shutdowns aimed at battling the pandemic has been tempered by reports of new waves of infections in states and 
countries that are further ahead in lifting lockdown measures. That includes small but disconcerting increases of 
new infections in South Korea, China and elsewhere. 
 'Re-opening economies is riddled with risks," analyst Hayaki Narita of Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. In 
London, the FTSE 100 was 0.9% higher, at 5,995, while the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 0.3% to 4,479. Germany's 
DAX rose 0.4% to 10,872. The future for the S&#38;P 500 was up 0.3% while that for the Dow industrials gained 
0.4%. Budget airline Ryanair, which was Europe's busiest carrier before the pandemic, said it was preparing to 
operate nearly 1,000 daily flights starting in July, assuming government restrictions on flights are lifted. But in a sign 
that businesses are still suffering, major business lobbies in Germany, Italy and France published an appeal for 
more economic support across Europe. In China, new figures showed that auto sales fell again in April but losses 
narrowed in a sign the industry's biggest global market is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic as Beijing 
eases anti-disease controls. Sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans in the industry's biggest global market were down 
2.6% from a year earlier at 1.5 million, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was an 
improvement over March's 48.4% contraction and a nearly 82% plunge in February.  The industry group said the 
market is showing 'obvious signs of recovery.'  But that news and reports of stronger growth in lending did little to lift 
sentiment. The Shanghai Composite index shed 0.1% to 2,891.56. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.5% to 24,245.68. 
(Ad) A Wall Street legend whom millions have seen on Fox Business, CNBC, and Bloomberg TV just made a 
prediction that has stunned the business world. WARNING: What he says contradicts everything you're hearing 
from Wall Street and the Main Street media. If you want to see how to make a fortune in 2020, it's important you 
watch this interview right away. Japan's Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% lower to 20,366.48, while South Korea's Kospi gave 
up 0.7% to 1,922.17.  Australia's S&#38;P/ASX 200 fell 1.1% to 5,403.00 after the country's treasurer said the 
country faces a 'sobering' economic outlook due to the effects of the coronavirus and will have its largest-ever 
deficit when a revised budget is released in October. An uptick in cases in South Korea has added to concern over 
the potential for rebounds in new coronavirus infections in places that relax restrictions. More than 100 new cases 
have been reported that were linked to bars and clubs, more than half of them in the capital, Seoul. China reported 
only one new case on Tuesday, but that followed double-digit increases over the previous two days that set off 
renewed warnings to the public to not to become overconfident. Many companies are reporting first quarter 
World shares edge up as economies slowly reopen
earnings, often opting to give no financial forecasts due to overwhelming uncertainty over what lies ahead. That 
was true of Toyota Motor Corp., whose shares fell 2% on Tuesday as it reported its net profit dropped nearly 90% in 
the January-March quarter from a year earlier, though it said it expected a recovery as the pandemic is brought 
under control.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury was steady at 0.70%.  Benchmark U.S. crude oil climbed $1.37 to 
$25.51 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell 60 cents, or 2.4%, to settle at 
$24.14 a barrel on Monday. Brent crude oil, the international standard, added 95 cents to $30.58 per barrel. It 
dropped 4.3% to $29.63 a barrel in London. The dollar fetched 107.34 Japanese yen, down from 107.66 late 
Monday. The euro rose to $1.0846 from $1.0807. Companies Mentioned in This Article 20 Stocks to Sell

companies. No investor relations person wants to see "hold" and "sell" ratings issued for their stock. In reality, a 
"buy" rating really means "hold." "Hold" ratings really mean "sell" and "sell" ratings mean get out while you still can.

problem. We've compiled a list of the companies that Wall Street's top equities research analysts are consistently

May 11, 2020( ACTmedia News: http://actmedia.eu Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair, the biggest low-cost airline in 
Europe, will reopen its Bucharest to London Stansted route on May 15, when the COVID-19 lockdown ends in 
Romania. 
The airline will have three flights per week on this route, which has been included in its limited flight schedule. 'We 
are pleased to add this route connecting Bucharest and London Stansted with three weekly services from May 15. 
We work with EU Governments to try to keep some minimum flight links open for emergency reasons, even though 
the passenger loads on these flights is very low,' said Olga Pawlonka, Sales &#38; Marketing Manager CEE &#38; 
Balkans at Ryanair. 'Our current limited schedule continues to maintain vital links across Europe to facilitate our 
passengers and their families to deal with emergencies that may require urgent travel over the coming days and 
weeks. All the aircraft are disinfected daily, and we ask all passengers to cooperate fully with our crews who are 
doing their best in difficult times,' she added. As most EU countries have imposed flight bans or other restrictions, 
over 99% of Ryanair's aircraft are grounded for the coming weeks. The company operates only several routes from 
the UK and Ireland to other destinations in Europe. 'At this time, we expect scheduled flights to return sometime in 
July,' the Ryanair representative said.

May 12, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  LONDON (AP) — Budget airline 
Ryanair says it will begin operating nearly 1,000 daily flights starting in July, assuming government restrictions on 
flights within Europe are lifted after the shutdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The carrier, which was Europe's 
busiest airline before the pandemic, said Tuesday it will restore 90% of its pre-COVID-19 route network, though with 
less frequency. The airline has been operating with a skeleton schedule since mid-March, with some 30 flights daily 
between Ireland, the U.K. and Europe. 
'After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow people to return 
to work and restart Europe's tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs,' Ryanair Chief Executive 
Eddie Wilson said. The strategy is not without risk. Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned Tuesday that people 
were unlikely to be able to go on foreign holidays this summer. Asked whether 'summer was cancelled,' Mr 
Hancock told ITV: 'I think that's likely to be the case.' 'It is unlikely that big, lavish international holidays are going to 
be possible for this summer,'' he said. 'I just think that's a reality of life.' Aviation has been among the hardest hit 
industries in the pandemic, with aircraft around the world grounded by travel restrictions. Many have cut costs and 
staff to respond. The latest example is Belgium's Brussels Airlines, which on Tuesday unveiled a cost-cutting plan 
that will result in the reduction of 25% of its workforce. The Lufthansa subsidiary, which employs 4,000 people, has 
suspended its flights as a result of the pandemic. The carrier, which also suffered amid the bankruptcy of travel 
operator Thomas Cook last year, plans to reduce its fleet from 54 to 38 aircraft. Brussels Airlines says it is losing 1 
million euros ($1.1 million) a day because of revenue losses, aircraft leasing and maintenance costs. The company 
has asked the government for 290 million euros in aid. (Ad) Since 2016, Teeka Tiwari has trumped the stock 
market. His investment recommendations have averaged 154% per year. That's 10 times the S&#38;P. And 81 
times the average investor, according to JP Morgan! Ryanair, warned, meanwhile, that flying would not be the same 
as it once was. On the plane, lining up for toilets will be forbidden, though access to bathrooms can be made on 
request. Crew members will wear masks and offer limited services. Cash will no longer be accepted. It did not 
specify if some seats would be left empty. The airline also announced that passengers flying in July and August will 
be required at check-in to state the length of their planned visit and give an address for their destination. The 
information will be given to governments in the event they want to monitor the passenger for isolation requirements.  
William Ryder, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said Ryanair's announcement seems 'optimistic,'' though 
'fortune favors the well prepared.'' 'Ryanair won't be caught napping if flights are resumed this summer,'' he said in 
a statement. 'While preparing to get planes back in the air will cost money, which will be wasted if restrictions aren't 
lifted, management clearly feels this is a risk worth running.' ___ Associated Press Writer Sam Petrequin

investment trusts (REITs) that you can buy through your brokerage account. Given the sheer number of REITs, it 
can be hard to identify which real-estate stocks are going to outperform the market. Fortunately, Wall Street's 
brightest minds have already done this for us. Every year, analyst issue approximately 4,000 distinct 
recommendations for REITs. Analysts don't always get their "buy" ratings right, but it's worth taking a hard look 
when several analysts from different brokerages and research firm are giving "strong buy" and "buy" ratings to the 
same REIT. This slide show lists the 15 REITs that have the highest average analyst recommendations from Wall 
Street's equities research analysts over the last 12 months.View the "15 REITS Analysts Can't Stop

on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, 
especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF 
THE HOUR: — Dr. Fauci to warn of 'needless death' in U.S. from premature reopening. — More than 8,000 died in 
British nursing homes in 2 months. — U.S. donates 1,000 ventilators to South Africa. — Expert warns many 
countries are driving blind as they reopen. ___ LONDON — More than 8,000 people died with the coronavirus in 
British nursing homes since the first recorded death from March 2 to May 1. The U.K.'s Office for National Statistics 
says in the two-month period there were 8,312 recorded deaths in care homes in England and Wales that 
mentioned COVID-19 on the death certificate. The figure doesn't include deaths in Scotland or Northern Ireland, 
which would add several hundred to the total. In all, there were 35,044 deaths involving the coronavirus in England 
and Wales to May 1. The figure is higher than the official government toll, which stood Monday at 32,065, because 
it includes cases in which COVID-19 was suspected but not confirmed by a test. The number of deaths among 
people with the virus, both in hospitals and elsewhere, is starting to fall. Nick Stripe, head of health analysis at the 
statistics office, says the total number of weekly deaths is declining but remains well above average for the time of 
year. ___ VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is urging governments hire more nurses and invest in their training and 
working conditions, saying the COVID-19 pandemic has shown a 'number of deficiencies' in the way governments 
provide medical care for their people. (Ad) Eric Fry, one of America's top Investment Strategists, provides his latest 
report 5 Tech Stocks Set for 1,000% Gains after the Coronavirus Sell off. You can't afford to miss out on the once in

and says their 'fundamental importance' had been reaffirmed during the pandemic. He issued the message on the 
World Health Organization's International Nurses Day and the 200th anniversary of the birth of Florence 
Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing. Francis noted many nurses have died during the pandemic. He asks 
world leaders "to invest in health care as the primary common good, by strengthening its systems and employing 
greater numbers of nurses, so as to ensure adequate care to everyone, with respect for the dignity of each person.' 
___ PARIS — Farmers markets reopened around Paris as the country gradually lifts two months of coronavirus 
confinement. Signs warned customers not to touch the produce, and vendors chatted with shoppers through plastic

shields amid strawberries, asparagus and sea snails. Marie Claude Polichoik, a 70-year-old Parisian shopper, says 
she missed the markets and hoped to 'keep local trade on its feet.' In eastern France, the European Parliament's 
headquarters in Strasbourg transformed its emptied halls into a mass virus testing center that opened Tuesday. The 
surrounding region was the first major virus hotspot in France, which has reported more than 26,000 deaths from 
the pandemic. ___ HELSINKI — The Finnish national airline Finnair will require passengers and cabin crew to wear 
face masks on all flights effective May 18 through at least the end of August. Piia Karhu from Finnair's customer 
experience unit says, 'we want everyone to be able to fly with confidence.' She adds passengers of Finnair, which is 
heavily focused on flights to Asia, would board a plane with their own mask and wear it throughout the flight. Finnair 
says face masks would be available at its main hub, Helsinki Airport, and other Finnish airports. The Finnish airport 
operator Finavia says the use of mouth-nose protectors is required for all airport employees in Finland working with 
customers. It recommended passengers wear one as they move through airports. Finland, a nation of 5.5 million, 
has registered 5,984 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 271 deaths. ___ WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci says 
he intends to warn the nation Tuesday that 'needless suffering and death' will result from a rushed reopening of the 
economy. Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will appear before the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee at a hearing assessing reopening plans. In an email to the New 
York Times, Fauci says his major message will concern the danger of trying to open the country. 'If we skip over the 
checkpoints in the guidelines to 'Open America Again,' then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the 
country,' Fauci wrote. 'This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our 
quest to return to normal.' This puts Fauci at odds with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly urged 
governors to lift business closings and stay-at-home orders. ___ JOHANNESBURG — The U.S. government has 
donated 1,000 ventilators to South Africa to help the country respond to COVID-19. South Africa has the most 
confirmed cases of the disease in Africa with more than 10,600, including 206 deaths. The new ventilators are 
valued at $14 million, and with accessories, service plans and shipping, the total donation is worth $20 million, said 
the U.S. embassy in a statement issued Tuesday. The ventilators, produced in the United States, will help South 
Africa's hospitals treat patients in intensive care units, and the U.S. Agency for International Development will work 
with the South African government to distribute the equipment across the country. U.S. ambassador to South Africa 
Lana Marks was at Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo airport on Monday to receive the shipment.  'These ventilators are 
another example of the American spirit of generosity as we battle this virus at home in the United States and 
together abroad with our partner countries,' said Marks, in the statement.  The donation of ventilators brings the 
total U.S. government financial support to South Africa's COVID-19 response to more than $41 million, according to 
the statement. In addition, the U.S. is supporting up to 5,400 community healthcare workers to assist with the South 
African government's community COVID-19 screening campaign and provide HIV treatment support, through the 
U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). ___ WARSAW, Poland — Poland's health authorities 
say the decision on the pace of lifting restrictions in the southern mining region of Silesia will depend on the results 
of thousands of coronavirus tests being done there among miners and their families.  Densely-populated Silesia, a 
region around the city of Katowice, had emerged as a hotbed of infections, especially in the mines. Some 15,000 
miners are being tested there this week.  So far, some 600 infections have been reported, but in most cases the 
symptoms were only mild, Deputy Health Minister Janusz Cieszynski said Tuesday.  He said that depending on the 
final results and on recommendations from sanitary authorities a individual approach can be applied to regions with 
high rate of infections, including Silesia. Individual approach could mean that many of the anti-COVID-19 measures 
of social distancing and isolation could remain in force there, while they are being gradually lifted in other areas.  
Two other regions with high infection rate are Masovia, around Warsaw, and the eastern region around the city of 
Poznan. Silesia accounts for some 3,800 reported cases of infection, out of over 16,500 reported cases in Poland. 
Almost 830 people in the nation of 38 million have died. ___ BRUSSELS — Hard-hit by the coronavirus crisis, 
Belgium's Brussels Airlines unveiled Tuesday a cost-cutting plan that will result in the reduction of 25% of its 
workforce. The Lufthansa subsidiary, which employs 4,000 people, has suspended its flights as a result of the 
pandemic, which has put air travel at a halt. The carrier, which also suffered from the bankruptcy of travel operator 
Thomas Cook last year, plans to reduce its fleet from 54 to 38 aircraft as part of the restructuring. Brussels Airlines 
says it is losing one million euro ($1.08 million) a day because of revenue losses, aircraft leasing and maintenance 
costs. The company has asked the government for €290 million ($314 million) in aid. 'While the turnaround plan is 
indispensable to overcome the crisis, the ongoing discussions with both the Belgian government and Lufthansa 
remain essential,' Brussels Airlines said. 'The Belgian home carrier hopes for a positive outcome of the talks with 
the Belgian authorities on the financial support that is needed to overcome the consequences of this unprecedented 
The Latest: 8,000 died in British nursing homes in 2 months
crisis, while it seeks for assistance of Lufthansa for the restructuring costs.' Brussels Airlines said it is confident it 
will 'grow again in a profitable way' when air travel returns to normal. ___ MADRID — Spain is reporting 176 new 
confirmed deaths for coronavirus during the past 24 hours, bringing the country's total death toll to 26,920. New 
infections confirmed by laboratory tests are up on Tuesday by 426. The total contagion, including antibody tests, 
stands at 269,520. The figures were slightly up from a day before, but records usually see an increase on Tuesday 
as unreported data over the weekend shows up in official statistics. Nearly 140,000 people have recovered after 
contracting the virus, Spain's Health Ministry says. Roughly half of Spaniards are starting to enjoy a loser version of 
the country's stringent lockdown adopted in mid-March. On Tuesday, the government published a new set of rules 
requiring all incoming visitors from overseas to quarantine for two weeks if they arrive after May 15. ___ ATHENS, 
Greece — Police in northern Greece say migrants at a holding site near the country's border with Turkey have 
staged violent protests following weeks of delays in processing their asylum claims due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Authorities said the protests also involved unaccompanied minors at the closed facility which currently houses some 
250 asylum seekers. No injuries were reported. The asylum service's operations have been scaled back due to the 
pandemic restriction measures that have affected many public services. Greek authorities are struggling to cope 
with a spike in migrant crossings from Turkey, at the land border and islands, that occurred before the lockdown. 
Greece and Turkey were also involved in a standoff at the border for more than two weeks in late February and 
early March — after Turkey's government announced it would no longer prevent migrants trying to reach the 
European Union. Greece used police and its armed forces with assistance from the EU border protection agency 
Frontex to stop thousands of migrants trying to force their way over the border. ___ LONDON — Budget airline 
Ryanair will begin operating nearly 1,000 daily flights starting in July — assuming government restrictions on flights 
within Europe are lifted after the shutdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The carrier says it will restore 90% of its 
pre-COVID-19 route network. The airline has been operating with a skeleton schedule since mid-March, with some 
30 flights daily between Ireland, the UK and Europe. On the plane, lining up for toilets will be forbidden, though 
access to bathrooms can be made on request. Crew members will wear masks and offer limited services. The 
airline also announced that passengers flying in July and August will be required at check-in to state how long their 
planned visit will be and what address they will use during their visit. The information will be given to governments 
in the event they want to monitor the passenger for isolation requirements. ___ COPENHAGEN, Denmark — A top 
medical official in Denmark said Tuesday that 'it is very unlikely that another wave of corona will occur' in the 
Scandinavian country.  'But we may see changes in the reproduction rate,' said Kaare Moelbak of Statens Serum 
Institut, a government agency that maps the spread of the coronavirus in Denmark. Currently the Danish so-called 
reproduction rate, which measures the average number of people a person with the virus infects, is at 0.7, down 
from a previous 0.9. It has been below 1.0 in the past weeks. Moelbak said Denmark now had built up a test 
capacity and can now isolate infected people. He spoke at a news conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette 
Frederiksen who announced that Denmark will create an agency to ensure the supply of protective equipment and 
testing facilities to 'strengthen the preparedness' in the future. 'We don't want to stand in a situation where we lack 
tests and protective equipment,' Frederiksen said. Denmark started a lockdown March 11 and has in the past 
weeks slowly reopened society. ___ PARIS — French children start going back to school on Tuesday as the 
country is gradually lifting confinement measures, following two months of lockdown. Authorities say 86% of 
preschools and primary schools are reopening this week. Most schools across the country start accommodating 
children on Tuesday. In Paris, schools will reopen Thursday. Classes are capped at 10 students at preschools and 
15 elsewhere. Students are required to keep physical distance from each other and wash their hands several times 
a day. Teachers must wear a mask. School attendance is not compulsory. The government has allowed parents to 
keep children at home amid fears prompted by the COVID-19, as France is one of the hardest-hit countries in the 
world. Junior high schools in regions with fewer virus cases are expected to reopen next week. A target date hasn't 
been scheduled yet for high schools. As of Tuesday, French authorities reported nearly 140,000 people infected 
with the virus and more than 26,000 deaths. ___ PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo's acting prime minister has returned 
to his office after the person suspected of being exposed to the virus tested negative, his spokesman said Tuesday. 
Acting Prime Minister Albin Kurti 'has returned to the regular working regime' and he has not been tested of the 
virus because 'the suspected person he had contacted resulted negative,' said Perparim Kryeziu, a government 
spokesperson. A day earlier Kurti said he was quarantining himself at home following contacts with a possible virus-
infected official. Kosovo has eased some of its lockdown measures, but it is still with closed borders and many 
businesses remain shut. As of Tuesday, Kosovo has had 28 confirmed virus deaths and about 900 confirmed 
cases. ___ JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's death toll from the coronavirus outbreak breached 1,000-mark on 
The Latest: 8,000 died in British nursing homes in 2 months
Tuesday, making it the country with the most COVID-19 deaths and the highest fatality rate in Southeast Asia. The 
COVID-19 task force spokesman Achmad Yurianto confirmed 16 new deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the 
country's death toll to 1,007. The number of coronavirus fatalities become under scrutiny in recent days as media 
reports and medical experts said the national death toll was likely more than double the official figure of 1,007. 
Indonesia has one of the lowest testing rates in the world and some epidemiologists say that has made it harder to 
get an accurate picture of the infections in the world's fourth most populous country. ___ Follow AP news coverage

fresh outbreaks of coronavirus cases and more infections among White House staff overshadowed hopes Tuesday 
over reopening economies. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks are off to a slightly higher start on 
Wall Street as more signs of calm steadily return to the market following weeks of turbulence. Energy and industrial 
companies were among the early winners Tuesday. The S&#38;P 500 rose 0.2% in the first few minutes of trading, 
and the Nasdaq was nearly flat. 
Investors were also embracing signs that businesses were doing their best to reopen following lockdowns meant to 
contain the coronavirus pandemic. Simon Property Group, a major mall operator, rose sharply after the company 
said it hoped to have half of its retail locations open within the next week.  THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. 
AP's earlier story is below: World shares were mostly higher on Tuesday as countries gradually lifted restrictions on 
business and public life, though worries over fresh outbreaks of coronavirus cases persisted. Optimism over plans 
for reopening in many countries after shutdowns aimed at battling the pandemic has been tempered by reports of 
new waves of infections in states and countries that are further ahead in lifting lockdown measures. That includes 
small but disconcerting increases of new infections in South Korea, China and elsewhere.  'Re-opening economies 
is riddled with risks," analyst Hayaki Narita of Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. In London, the FTSE 100 was 
0.9% higher, at 5,995, while the CAC 40 in Paris slipped 0.3% to 4,479. Germany's DAX rose 0.4% to 10,872. The 
future for the S&#38;P 500 was up 0.3% while that for the Dow industrials gained 0.4%. Budget airline Ryanair, 
which was Europe's busiest carrier before the pandemic, said it was preparing to operate nearly 1,000 daily flights 
starting in July, assuming government restrictions on flights are lifted. But in a sign that businesses are still 
suffering, major business lobbies in Germany, Italy and France published an appeal for more economic support 
across Europe. (Ad) Eric Fry, one of America's top Investment Strategists, provides his latest report 5 Tech Stocks

losses narrowed in a sign the industry's biggest global market is recovering from the coronavirus pandemic as 
Beijing eases anti-disease controls. Sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans in the industry's biggest global market 
were down 2.6% from a year earlier at 1.5 million, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That 
was an improvement over March's 48.4% contraction and a nearly 82% plunge in February.  The industry group 
said the market is showing 'obvious signs of recovery.'  But that news and reports of stronger growth in lending did 
little to lift sentiment. The Shanghai Composite index shed 0.1% to 2,891.56. Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.5% to 
US stock indexes open slightly higher as some calm returns
24,245.68.  Japan's Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% lower to 20,366.48, while South Korea's Kospi gave up 0.7% to 
1,922.17.  Australia's S&#38;P/ASX 200 fell 1.1% to 5,403.00 after the country's treasurer said the country faces a 
'sobering' economic outlook due to the effects of the coronavirus and will have its largest-ever deficit when a 
revised budget is released in October. An uptick in cases in South Korea has added to concern over the potential 
for rebounds in new coronavirus infections in places that relax restrictions. More than 100 new cases have been 
reported that were linked to bars and clubs, more than half of them in the capital, Seoul. China reported only one 
new case on Tuesday, but that followed double-digit increases over the previous two days that set off renewed 
warnings to the public to not to become overconfident. Many companies are reporting first quarter earnings, often 
opting to give no financial forecasts due to overwhelming uncertainty over what lies ahead. That was true of Toyota 
Motor Corp., whose shares fell 2% on Tuesday as it reported its net profit dropped nearly 90% in the January-
March quarter from a year earlier, though it said it expected a recovery as the pandemic is brought under control.

in the wake of our society's call to flatten the curve of the coronavirus, more Americans find themselves in the 
unfamiliar position of working from home. Aside from the mental and emotional challenge that some employees 
face from not having a defined workplace outside of the home, there are logistical challenges for businesses to 
ensure their employees can manage their work efficiently and effectively. However, other Americans are 
sequestered, not by choice, but because they have no business to go-to for the time being. They face a different, 
unique set of challenges as more and more states begin to close bars, restaurants, and other social meeting 
venues. It all happened so fast. And as an investor, it may be tough to think of investing in the market now, or ever 
again. But history favors those investors who have stayed the course even in the midst of a severe bear market that

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-plans-to-introduce-1000-flights-a-day-by-july/Ryanair is planning to 
reintroduce 1,000 flights a day by July 1, with passengers undergoing temperature checks at airports to combat the 
spread of coronavirus.Europe's busiest airline said today that 40 per cent of its flight schedule would be restored 
within seven weeks, subject to government restrictions on travel across the Continent being lifted. The budget 
carrier, which operates from almost 20 UK airports, said that it would restart flying from 'most' of its bases across 
Europe in the biggest expansion of travel since the lockdown was introduced. 
The move comes despite the planned introduction of a two-week quarantine period for most passengers entering 
the UK, possibly from June 1. Other airlines have said that the measures will decimate the industry and prevent the 
vast majority of people from flying. Ryanair insisted that it would put extensive safety measures in place to limit any 
spread of coronavirus. Passengers will be asked to take their own temperature before leaving home and it could be 
rechecked at the airport by airline staff. Travellers with a high temperature — typically those above 38C — 'will be 
asked to return home', Ryanair said. All passengers will have to wear face coverings throughout the airport and 
plane cabin. Queueing for lavatories on board aircraft will also be banned, with customers instead forced to request 
to use the loo. The Irish airline insisted that social distancing on aircraft 'will be encouraged where it is possible' 
although it did not reveal how many seats will be taken up. Other airlines have faced criticism for failing to maintain 
empty seats between passengers to enforce social distancing. Some experts have said that airlines would only be 
able to carry as little as 20 per cent of usual passenger numbers to maintain the full recommended two metres 
between travellers. The airline, which plans to operate at least some flights on 90 per cent of its usual flight network, 
said that on-board refreshments will be limited to pre-packaged items, sales will be cashless and cabins will be 
disinfected every night. Ryanair indicated that it would co-operate with any quarantine measures imposed by EU 
states and the UK. The UK will require passengers arriving from any country — other than France and Ireland — to 
self-isolate for a two-week period, under measures announced this week. The airline said that all passengers flying 
in July and August will be asked to fill in details at check-in of how long their planned visit will be, their address 
while visiting another EU country and contact information. This will 'help them to monitor any isolation regulations 
they require of visitors'. The move represents the biggest boost to flight schedules since the lockdown was imposed 
in late March. At least 98 per cent of flights in and out of the UK have been grounded in recent weeks, with the boss 
of British Airways' parent company warning yesterday that it represented the 'biggest crisis' in the airline's history. 
Ryanair plans to introduce 1,000 flights a day by July
Earlier this month Wizz Air, the eastern European budget carrier, restored seven flights out of Luton airport and 
other carriers such as Lufthansa and KLM have also announced plans to extend schedules. Ryanair has been 
operating a skeleton daily schedule of 30 flights between Ireland, the UK and Europe over the last seven weeks. 
Eddie Wilson, the carrier's chief executive, said: 'It is important for our customers and our people that we return to 
some normal schedules from 1 July onwards. After four months, it is time to get Europe flying again so we can 
reunite friends and families, allow people to return to work and restart Europe's tourism industry, which provides so 
many millions of jobs. 'Ryanair will work closely with public health authorities to ensure that these flights comply, 
where possible, with effective measures to limit the spread of Covid-19. As already shown in Asia, temperature 
checks and face masks or coverings are the most effective way to achieve this on short-haul within Europe's single 
market. 'Now that Europe's states are allowing some gradual return to normal life, we expect this will evolve over 
the coming weeks and months.' Read more: Ryanair plans to introduce 1,000 flights a day by July[1] [ 1]:

May 12, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair announced it is planning 
to restart 40% of its planned network for the main summer months. The airline has grounded most of its flights[1] 
amid the coronavirus crisis. Currently, Ryanair is having about 30 flights a day, concentrated on connecting Ireland 
and the United Kingdom, but it said flights would be ramped up from late June. 'After four months, it is time to get 
Europe flying again so we can reunite friends and families, allow people to return to work, and restart Europe's 
tourism industry, which provides so many millions of jobs', the company's chief executive, Eddie Wilson, said. 'With 
more than six weeks to go to 1st July, Ryanair believes this is the most practical date to resume normal flight 
schedules, so that we can allow friends and families to reunite, commuters to go back to work, and allow those 
tourism based economies such as Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, France and others, to recover what is left of this 
year's tourism season', he added. According to the new safety rules, passengers will have to wear face coverings 
while passing through the airport and on the aircraft. Cabin crew, wearing face masks, will make inflight sales only 
with contactless payments, and passengers will not be permitted to line up for the toilet. [ 1]:

know it today does not look anything close to what it looked like 30 years ago? In 1987, IBM, Exxon, GE, Shell, 
AT&#38;T, Merck, Du Pont, Philip Morris, Ford and GM had the largest market caps on the S&#38;P 500. 
ExxonMobil is the only company on that list to remain in the top 10 in 2017. Even just 15 years ago, companies like 
Radio Shack, AOL, Yahoo and Blockbuster were an important part of the S&#38;P 500. Now, these companies no 
longer exist as public companies. As the years go by, some companies lose their luster and others rise to the top of 
the markets. We've already seen this in the last few decades with tech companies surpassing industrial and energy 
companies that once dominated the S&#38;P 500. It's hard to know what the next mega trend will be that will knock 
Apple, Google and Amazon off the top rankings of the S&#38;P 500, but we do know that companies won't stay on 
the S&#38;P 500 forever. We've identified 20 companies that are past their prime. They aren't at risk of a near-term 
delisting from the S&#38;P 500, but they are showing negative earnings growth for the next several years. If you 
own any of these stocks, consider selling them now before they become the next Yahoo, Radio Shack, Blockbuster,

Buy On This Historical Dip[1]It may seem hard to believe, but the current chaos in the energy sector, and oil stocks, 
in particular, will pass. The novel coronavirus that has birthed a global pandemic is being compared to the Spanish 
Flu of 1918. Of course, when you have once in a century event, it's difficult to look back in history and make an 
apples-to-apples comparison to our current situation. This isn't to minimize our current situation. It's simply to say 
that the market is forward-looking, but it's also emotional. And it also hates uncertainty. In a typical economic 
downturn, demand decreases, and investors are advised to 'buy the dip.' But in the current environment, demand 
has been destroyed. Millions of Americans are being asked, and in some cases ordered, to stay home. And this 
simply means that oil demand is down. And investors are looking at prices that are, in some cases, at all-time lows. 
The trading app Robinhood is frequented by millennial investors. And according to the latest information, many 
investors are trying to buy the dip on old guard oil stocks. That may be a mistake. But the energy sector is about 
more than just oil stocks. There are several companies that are holding their own in the current environment. And 
that means when the economy opens up, these companies will be well-positioned for further growth. Currently, the 
volatility and uncertainty surrounding energy stocks make them a poor choice for growth investors. However, many 
of these companies in this presentation offer a secure dividend that, along with the potential for capital appreciation, 
can make them a solid play for income investors. View the "7 Energy Stocks to Buy On This Historical Dip"[2]. [ 1]:

Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany. Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said Monday Feb. 3, 2020, 
that the grounding of the new Boeing Max jets will delay its growth targets.

extend by a year or two its target of flying 200 million people per year. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)The Latest 
on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, 
especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF 
THE HOUR: — Expert warns many countries are driving blind as they reopen. — U.S. infectious disease expert 
Fauci to warn of 'needless death' from premature reopening. — The United States donates 1,000 ventilators to 
South Africa. ___ WASHINGTON — The government's leading infectious disease expert says he intends to warn 
the nation Tuesday that 'needless suffering and death' will result from a rushed reopening of the economy. Dr. 
Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will appear before the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee at a hearing assessing reopening plans. In an email to the New 
York Times, Fauci said his major message will concern the danger of trying to open the country. 'If we skip over the 
checkpoints in the guidelines to 'Open America Again,' then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the 
country,' Fauci wrote. 'This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our 
quest to return to normal.' This puts Fauci at odds with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly urged 
governors to lift business closings and stay-at-home orders. ___ JOHANNESBURG — The U.S. government has 
donated 1,000 ventilators to South Africa to help the country respond to COVID-19. South Africa has the most 
confirmed cases of the disease in Africa with more than 10,600, including 206 deaths. The new ventilators are 
valued at $14 million, and with accessories, service plans and shipping, the total donation is worth $20 million, said 
the U.S. embassy in a statement issued Tuesday. (Ad) Trump's 5G plan is opening the flood gates to 3 million new

Africa's hospitals treat patients in intensive care units, and the U.S. Agency for International Development will work 
with the South African government to distribute the equipment across the country. U.S. ambassador to South Africa 
Lana Marks was at Johannesburg's O.R. Tambo airport on Monday to receive the shipment.  'These ventilators are 
another example of the American spirit of generosity as we battle this virus at home in the United States and 
together abroad with our partner countries,' said Marks, in the statement.  The donation of ventilators brings the

total U.S. government financial support to South Africa's COVID-19 response to more than $41 million, according to 
the statement. In addition, the U.S. is supporting up to 5,400 community healthcare workers to assist with the South 
African government's community COVID-19 screening campaign and provide HIV treatment support, through the 
U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). ___ WARSAW, Poland — Poland's health authorities 
say the decision on the pace of lifting restrictions in the southern mining region of Silesia will depend on the results 
of thousands of coronavirus tests being done there among miners and their families.  Densely-populated Silesia, a 
region around the city of Katowice, had emerged as a hotbed of infections, especially in the mines. Some 15,000 
miners are being tested there this week.  So far, some 600 infections have been reported, but in most cases the 
symptoms were only mild, Deputy Health Minister Janusz Cieszynski said Tuesday.  He said that depending on the 
final results and on recommendations from sanitary authorities a individual approach can be applied to regions with 
high rate of infections, including Silesia. Individual approach could mean that many of the anti-COVID-19 measures 
of social distancing and isolation could remain in force there, while they are being gradually lifted in other areas.  
Two other regions with high infection rate are Masovia, around Warsaw, and the eastern region around the city of 
Poznan. Silesia accounts for some 3,800 reported cases of infection, out of over 16,500 reported cases in Poland. 
Almost 830 people in the nation of 38 million have died. ___ BRUSSELS — Hard-hit by the coronavirus crisis, 
Belgium's Brussels Airlines unveiled Tuesday a cost-cutting plan that will result in the reduction of 25% of its 
workforce. The Lufthansa subsidiary, which employs 4,000 people, has suspended its flights as a result of the 
pandemic, which has put air travel at a halt. The carrier, which also suffered from the bankruptcy of travel operator 
Thomas Cook last year, plans to reduce its fleet from 54 to 38 aircraft as part of the restructuring. Brussels Airlines 
says it is losing one million euro ($1.08 million) a day because of revenue losses, aircraft leasing and maintenance 
costs. The company has asked the government for €290 million ($314 million) in aid. 'While the turnaround plan is 
indispensable to overcome the crisis, the ongoing discussions with both the Belgian government and Lufthansa 
remain essential,' Brussels Airlines said. 'The Belgian home carrier hopes for a positive outcome of the talks with 
the Belgian authorities on the financial support that is needed to overcome the consequences of this unprecedented 
crisis, while it seeks for assistance of Lufthansa for the restructuring costs.' Brussels Airlines said it is confident it 
will 'grow again in a profitable way' when air travel returns to normal. ___ MADRID — Spain is reporting 176 new 
confirmed deaths for coronavirus during the past 24 hours, bringing the country's total death toll to 26,920. New 
infections confirmed by laboratory tests are up on Tuesday by 426. The total contagion, including antibody tests, 
stands at 269,520. The figures were slightly up from a day before, but records usually see an increase on Tuesday 
as unreported data over the weekend shows up in official statistics. Nearly 140,000 people have recovered after 
contracting the virus, Spain's Health Ministry says. Roughly half of Spaniards are starting to enjoy a loser version of 
the country's stringent lockdown adopted in mid-March. On Tuesday, the government published a new set of rules 
requiring all incoming visitors from overseas to quarantine for two weeks if they arrive after May 15. ___ ATHENS, 
Greece — Police in northern Greece say migrants at a holding site near the country's border with Turkey have 
staged violent protests following weeks of delays in processing their asylum claims due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Authorities said the protests also involved unaccompanied minors at the closed facility which currently houses some 
250 asylum seekers. No injuries were reported. The asylum service's operations have been scaled back due to the 
pandemic restriction measures that have affected many public services. Greek authorities are struggling to cope 
with a spike in migrant crossings from Turkey, at the land border and islands, that occurred before the lockdown. 
Greece and Turkey were also involved in a standoff at the border for more than two weeks in late February and 
early March — after Turkey's government announced it would no longer prevent migrants trying to reach the 
European Union. Greece used police and its armed forces with assistance from the EU border protection agency 
Frontex to stop thousands of migrants trying to force their way over the border. ___ LONDON — Budget airline 
Ryanair will begin operating nearly 1,000 daily flights starting in July — assuming government restrictions on flights 
within Europe are lifted after the shutdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The carrier says it will restore 90% of its 
pre-COVID-19 route network. The airline has been operating with a skeleton schedule since mid-March, with some 
30 flights daily between Ireland, the UK and Europe. On the plane, lining up for toilets will be forbidden, though 
access to bathrooms can be made on request. Crew members will wear masks and offer limited services. The 
airline also announced that passengers flying in July and August will be required at check-in to state how long their 
planned visit will be and what address they will use during their visit. The information will be given to governments 
in the event they want to monitor the passenger for isolation requirements. ___ COPENHAGEN, Denmark — A top 
medical official in Denmark said Tuesday that 'it is very unlikely that another wave of corona will occur' in the 
Scandinavian country.  'But we may see changes in the reproduction rate,' said Kaare Moelbak of Statens Serum 
The Latest: Fauci to warn nation against premature reopening
Institut, a government agency that maps the spread of the coronavirus in Denmark. Currently the Danish so-called 
reproduction rate, which measures the average number of people a person with the virus infects, is at 0.7, down 
from a previous 0.9. It has been below 1.0 in the past weeks. Moelbak said Denmark now had built up a test 
capacity and can now isolate infected people. He spoke at a news conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette 
Frederiksen who announced that Denmark will create an agency to ensure the supply of protective equipment and 
testing facilities to 'strengthen the preparedness' in the future. 'We don't want to stand in a situation where we lack 
tests and protective equipment,' Frederiksen said. Denmark started a lockdown March 11 and has in the past 
weeks slowly reopened society. ___ PARIS — French children start going back to school on Tuesday as the 
country is gradually lifting confinement measures, following two months of lockdown. Authorities say 86% of 
preschools and primary schools are reopening this week. Most schools across the country start accommodating 
children on Tuesday. In Paris, schools will reopen Thursday. Classes are capped at 10 students at preschools and 
15 elsewhere. Students are required to keep physical distance from each other and wash their hands several times 
a day. Teachers must wear a mask. School attendance is not compulsory. The government has allowed parents to 
keep children at home amid fears prompted by the COVID-19, as France is one of the hardest-hit countries in the 
world. Junior high schools in regions with fewer virus cases are expected to reopen next week. A target date hasn't 
been scheduled yet for high schools. As of Tuesday, French authorities reported nearly 140,000 people infected 
with the virus and more than 26,000 deaths. ___ PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo's acting prime minister has returned 
to his office after the person suspected of being exposed to the virus tested negative, his spokesman said Tuesday. 
Acting Prime Minister Albin Kurti 'has returned to the regular working regime' and he has not been tested of the 
virus because 'the suspected person he had contacted resulted negative,' said Perparim Kryeziu, a government 
spokesperson. A day earlier Kurti said he was quarantining himself at home following contacts with a possible virus-
infected official. Kosovo has eased some of its lockdown measures, but it is still with closed borders and many 
businesses remain shut. As of Tuesday, Kosovo has had 28 confirmed virus deaths and about 900 confirmed 
cases. ___ JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's death toll from the coronavirus outbreak breached 1,000-mark on 
Tuesday, making it the country with the most COVID-19 deaths and the highest fatality rate in Southeast Asia. The 
COVID-19 task force spokesman Achmad Yurianto confirmed 16 new deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the 
country's death toll to 1,007. The number of coronavirus fatalities become under scrutiny in recent days as media 
reports and medical experts said the national death toll was likely more than double the official figure of 1,007. 
Indonesia has one of the lowest testing rates in the world and some epidemiologists say that has made it harder to 
get an accurate picture of the infections in the world's fourth most populous country. ___ Follow AP news coverage

corporate executive (such as a CEO, CFO or COO) that has non-public information about a company buys or sells 
shares of that company's stock. Company insiders are required by law to regularly report their stock purchases and 
sales to the SEC.Tracking a company's insider trades is a metric that can be used to identify the direction that the 
company's executives believes that the company is headed. If a number of insiders purchase more shares of their

May 12, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In this Sept. 12, 2018 file photo, a 
Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany. Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said Monday Feb. 3, 2020, 
that the grounding of the new Boeing Max jets will delay its growth targets.

on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, 
especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF 
THE HOUR: — Expert warns many countries are driving blind as they reopen. — Greece: Rioting at migrant center 
as pandemic halts asylum process. — Budget airline to operate almost 1,000 daily flights starting in July. — 
Denmark medical official says another wave of the coronavirus in the country is unlikely. ___ ATHENS, Greece — 
Police in northern Greece say migrants at a holding site near the country's border with Turkey have staged violent 
protests following weeks of delays in processing their asylum claims due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Authorities 
said the protests also involved unaccompanied minors at the closed facility which currently houses some 250 
asylum seekers. No injuries were reported. The asylum service's operations have been scaled back due to the 
pandemic restriction measures that have affected many public services. Greek authorities are struggling to cope 
with a spike in migrant crossings from Turkey, at the land border and islands, that occurred before the lockdown. 
Greece and Turkey were also involved in a standoff at the border for more than two weeks in late February and 
early March — after Turkey's government announced it would no longer prevent migrants trying to reach the 
European Union. Greece used police and its armed forces with assistance from the EU border protection agency 
Frontex to stop thousands of migrants trying to force their way over the border. ___ LONDON — Budget airline 
Ryanair will begin operating nearly 1,000 daily flights starting in July — assuming government restrictions on flights 
within Europe are lifted after the shutdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. (Ad) A groundbreaking new technology 
is expected to be in every household in America by the end of the year... This technology has the potential to make 
over 266 million smartphones become obsolete forcing nearly every American to switch over to this new "5G 
Device". The carrier says it will restore 90% of its pre-COVID-19 route network. The airline has been operating with 
a skeleton schedule since mid-March, with some 30 flights daily between Ireland, the UK and Europe. On the plane, 
lining up for toilets will be forbidden, though access to bathrooms can be made on request. Crew members will wear 
masks and offer limited services. The airline also announced that passengers flying in July and August will be 
required at check-in to state how long their planned visit will be and what address they will use during their visit. The 
information will be given to governments in the event they want to monitor the passenger for isolation requirements. 
The Latest: Greek police say migrants staged violent protest
___ COPENHAGEN, Denmark — A top medical official in Denmark said Tuesday that 'it is very unlikely that 
another wave of corona will occur' in the Scandinavian country.  'But we may see changes in the reproduction rate,' 
said Kaare Moelbak of Statens Serum Institut, a government agency that maps the spread of the coronavirus in 
Denmark. Currently the Danish so-called reproduction rate, which measures the average number of people a 
person with the virus infects, is at 0.7, down from a previous 0.9. It has been below 1.0 in the past weeks. Moelbak 
said Denmark now had built up a test capacity and can now isolate infected people. He spoke at a news conference 
with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen who announced that Denmark will create an agency to ensure the 
supply of protective equipment and testing facilities to 'strengthen the preparedness' in the future. 'We don't want to 
stand in a situation where we lack tests and protective equipment,' Frederiksen said. Denmark started a lockdown 
March 11 and has in the past weeks slowly reopened society. ___ PARIS — French children start going back to 
school on Tuesday as the country is gradually lifting confinement measures, following two months of lockdown. 
Authorities say 86% of preschools and primary schools are reopening this week. Most schools across the country 
start accommodating children on Tuesday. In Paris, schools will reopen Thursday. Classes are capped at 10 
students at preschools and 15 elsewhere. Students are required to keep physical distance from each other and 
wash their hands several times a day. Teachers must wear a mask. School attendance is not compulsory. The 
government has allowed parents to keep children at home amid fears prompted by the COVID-19, as France is one 
of the hardest-hit countries in the world. Junior high schools in regions with fewer virus cases are expected to 
reopen next week. A target date hasn't been scheduled yet for high schools. As of Tuesday, French authorities 
reported nearly 140,000 people infected with the virus and more than 26,000 deaths. ___ PRISTINA, Kosovo — 
Kosovo's acting prime minister has returned to his office after the person suspected of being exposed to the virus 
tested negative, his spokesman said Tuesday. Acting Prime Minister Albin Kurti 'has returned to the regular working 
regime' and he has not been tested of the virus because 'the suspected person he had contacted resulted 
negative,' said Perparim Kryeziu, a government spokesperson. A day earlier Kurti said he was quarantining himself 
at home following contacts with a possible virus-infected official. Kosovo has eased some of its lockdown 
measures, but it is still with closed borders and many businesses remain shut. As of Tuesday, Kosovo has had 28 
confirmed virus deaths and about 900 confirmed cases. ___ JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia's death toll from the 
coronavirus outbreak breached 1,000-mark on Tuesday, making it the country with the most COVID-19 deaths and 
the highest fatality rate in Southeast Asia. The COVID-19 task force spokesman Achmad Yurianto confirmed 16 
new deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the country's death toll to 1,007. The number of coronavirus fatalities 
become under scrutiny in recent days as media reports and medical experts said the national death toll was likely 
more than double the official figure of 1,007. Indonesia has one of the lowest testing rates in the world and some 
epidemiologists say that has made it harder to get an accurate picture of the infections in the world's fourth most 
populous country. ___ LONDON — The coronavirus pandemic has scuttled summer solstice celebrations at 
Stonehenge, a highlight of the year for thousands of British pagans, druids and assorted revelers. English Heritage, 
which looks after the ancient stone circle, says restrictions on public events to slow the spread of the virus make it 
impossible to hold the event. It said it had decided to cancel the gathering 'after much deliberation and in 
consultation with our partners in the police and the emergency services, the druid and pagan community and 
others.' English Heritage says it will stream the sunrise online on the solstice, June 21. Thousands of people usually 
gather to watch the sun rise behind the Neolithic monument in southwest England on the Northern Hemisphere's 
longest day of the year. Stonehenge, a World Heritage site, is believed to be 4,500 years old. It is known for its 
alignment with the movements of the sun. ___ MADRID — Spain will require all visitors from abroad to quarantine 
for 14 days if they arrive in the country after May 15. The new Health Ministry order, published Tuesday in Spain's 
official gazette, says the goal is to 'limit the risks derived from the international traffic of people' during the rollback 
of the coronavirus lockdown. Travel agencies and transport companies must inform their customers about the new 
regulations before they sell their Spain-bound tickets, and airlines need to make sure that passengers fill out a 
'location card' in case they need to be contacted after their trip. Tourism-magnet Spain is starting to loosen the grip 
after seven weeks of strict confinement. Authorities have reported more than 26,700 deaths for the new coronavirus 
and over 268,000 infections confirmed by tests. ___ NEW DELHI, India — India is reopening parts of its colossal 
rail network and will run limited trains as the country begins easing its nearly seven-week strict lockdown amid an 
increase in coronavirus infections. Special trains will depart from select big cities Tuesday, including Delhi and 
Mumbai, and run to full capacity. Passengers will be allowed to enter stations only if they are asymptomatic and 
clear thermal screening; they must maintain social distancing on board and will be given hand sanitizers upon entry 
and exit. The train network often described as India's lifeline spans 67,000 kilometers (42,000 miles) and carries 
The Latest: Greek police say migrants staged violent protest
more than 20 million passengers daily.  India's rail, road and air services were suspended in late March as part of a 
tight nationwide lockdown that has helped keep confirmed coronavirus infections relatively low for a population of 
1.3 billion. But in recent days, as the lockdown has eased and some businesses have reopened, infections and 
deaths due to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, are increasing. India has confirmed 
70,756 coronavirus cases, including 2,293 deaths. ___ SINGAPORE — Singaporeans will be able to get a haircut 
at the barber or pop in to their favorite bakery Tuesday as the government loosens coronavirus restrictions three 
weeks before a partial lockdown ends.  Despite an upsurge in cases due to an outbreak among foreign workers 
staying in crowded dormitories, the government says transmission in the local community has dropped and it plans 
a phased reopening of the economy. Barbers and hairdressers, food manufacturers and outlets, and laundry shops 
are among selected businesses that can open with strict health measures in place Tuesday after five weeks of 
shutdown.  Barbers are open by appointment only and notices outside shops call for face masks before entry. 
Officials reminded citizens not to rush out or loiter outside.  Singapore has reported 23,822 infections, the most in 
Asia after China, India and Pakistan. But it has a low fatality rate of 21 deaths. About 90% of cases are linked to 
foreign workers' dorms, which have all remained locked down as testing continues. ___ SEOUL, South Korea — 
The mayor of the South Korean capital of Seoul says the number of recent coronavirus cases linked to the city's 
clubs and other nightspots has surpassed 100. Park Won-soon said in a virus briefing that 64 of the 101 cases 
detected as of 10 a.m. Tuesday came from Seoul, which is requesting that anyone who visited any clubs or bars in 
the Itaewon entertainment district between April 24 and May 6 get tested for COVID-19. He said more than 7,200 
people have been tested so far. More than 8,500 police officers have been deployed nationwide to track down 
thousands of people who were listed as customers of the Itaewon clubs and bars linked to infections but have been 
out of contact, according to Health Ministry official Yoon Tae-ho. Health workers are also using credit card and 
telecommunications records to track down Itaewon visitors. Park said the city sent text messages to some 10,900 
people urging them to get tested after receiving data from police and mobile phone operators that showed they 
used their devices in the area. ___  SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the 
coronavirus in the past 24 hours. Figures released by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 
Tuesday brought national figures to 10,936 cases and 258 deaths. At least 1,138 infections have been linked to 
international arrivals, but such cases have declined after the country strengthened border controls in April, enforcing 
two-week quarantines on all passengers coming from abroad. The recent transmissions linked to club goers have 
alarmed a country that had eased up on social distancing and scheduled a reopening of schools, which was pushed 
back by a week to May 20. ___ MANILA, Philippines — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the massive 
lockdown that has restricted millions to their homes will be eased, but he warned that people who want to return to 
work must follow safeguards to avoid more deaths and a second wave of COVID-19 outbreaks. The Philippine 
economy contracted in the first quarter and the finance secretary reported that up to 1.5 million jobs have been lost 
during the lockdown on Luzon island, the country's most populous region, which includes the capital, Manila. 
Duterte made the announcement in videotaped remarks shown on nationwide television Tuesday. He said his 
spokesman will later disclose which regions will remain under lockdown and which areas would be released based 
on the scale and speed of infections. The two-month lockdown was supposed to last until May 15. 'Don't gamble 
with COVID,' Duterte said. The Philippines has reported more than 11,000 infections, including 726 deaths. ___ 
BEIJING — China reported just one new coronavirus case Tuesday as the government presses ahead with 
reopening measures, including allowing Beijing middle school senior students to return to class and Shanghai 
Disneyland to open its gates again to a limited number of visitors.  Other measures have included permitting 
Beijing's ancient Forbidden City to expand its visitor numbers, as long as they book online first, show evidence they 
are healthy and wear a mask while touring the massive complex that was home to generations of China's 
emperors.  Also on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said 115 people remain in treatment and 763 are 
being isolated and monitored as either suspected cases or after testing positive for the virus without showing 
symptoms. China has not reported a new death from the virus in almost a month. In total, it has recorded 4,633 
deaths among 82,919 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.  The 
single new case Tuesday follows double-digit increases over the previous two days that had set off renewed 
warnings from officials for citizens to avoid becoming overconfident and prompted the suspension of train service to 
one affected county in the northeastern province of Jilin. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus

Oversold Stocks That Are Ready For a Comeback[1]A fundamental concept of investing is to buy stocks at a value. 
One strategy used by investors is to focus on stocks that are oversold. Fundamental analysis can give investors an 
The Latest: Greek police say migrants staged violent protest
idea of certain stocks to look at. However, momentum is also important. For that reason, investors look for technical 
indicators to help them find oversold stocks that might be ready for a comeback. One of the most popular tools is 
the Relative Strength Index (RSI). The RSI is a momentum indicator that measures the velocity and magnitude of 
price movements. The index also compares them with the magnitude of average gains and average losses. The 
formula for calculating RSI is as follows: RSI = 100 - ( 100 / 1 + RS) Where RS (Relative Strength) is the average 
gain divided by the average loss. Investors can use virtually any timeframe they wish. One of the most common is a 
14-day RSI. Decreasing the number of days makes the RSI more sensitive to price changes. Conversely increasing 
the number of days makes the indicator less sensitive to price changes. Investors may have different overbought or 
oversold indicators, but standard benchmarks are a stock may be overbought if its RSI exceeds 70 and may be 
oversold if its RSI exceeds 30. The stocks in this presentation are chosen for a variety of fundamental and technical 
indicators. And all the stocks have been affected in one form or another by the Covid-19 pandemic. View the "10

May 12, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The outbreak of the coronavirus 
has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are developments Tuesday related 
to national and global response, the work place and the spread of the virus.  ________________________ 
TRAVEL &#38; LODGING: Hotels, rental cars, cruises, flights, anything associated with getting away from it all, is 
on hold. 
Quarterly numbers from airlines and the rest of the travel industry this week and last were abysmal. Job cuts have 
begun.  — Hyatt will begin laying off about 1,300 people next month. The hotel chain has slashed costs through pay 
cuts for executives as well as work and pay reductions for workers, but it has not been enough to staunch the 
bleeding.  — Brussels Airlines will let 25% of its workers go as part of a massive cost-cutting plan. The Lufthansa 
subsidiary in Belgium, which employs 4,000 people, has suspended its flights and plans to reduce its fleet from 54 
to 38 aircraft as part of its restructuring. — Ryanair will begin operating nearly 1,000 daily flights starting in July — 
assuming government restrictions on flights within Europe are lifted. The budget airline will restore 90% of its pre-
COVID-19 route network. The airline has been operating with a skeleton schedule since mid-March, with some 30 
flights daily between Ireland, the UK and Europe. GOVERNMENTS &#38; CENTRAL BANKS: The U.S. is trying to 
determine how best to reopen the economy while limiting risk. There have been red flags from nation's that have 
already attempted to do so.  — People in Singapore will be able to get professional haircuts or pop into the bakery 
Tuesday as the government loosens restrictions, three weeks before a partial lockdown ends. Barbers and 
hairdressers, food manufacturers and outlets as well as laundry shops are among select businesses that can open 
their doors under strict rules. (Ad) Starting with just $15,000 Kyle Dennis Turned His Money Into Over $7 Million

the end of October, but said that from August the government might pay less than the current 80% of workers' 
salaries as it grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic. Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons on Tuesday that he 
wouldn't give up on people who relied on the program — an unprecedented intervention to keep people in work 
amid the crisis. He said 7.5 million jobs had been furloughed — jobs that would have been lost if not for the 
program. MARKETS: — World shares were mostly higher on Tuesday as restrictions are lifted in numerous regions 
of the world. LAST LAUGH: Peloton Interactive Inc. began trending late last year and not in the way any company 
would desire. A commercial for Peloton was described as 'dystopian,' and 'sexist," and the blowback was so severe, 
shares of the company plunged. What a difference a pandemic makes. In a regulatory filing Tuesday, Peloton said 
it's topped 1 million aggregate connected fitness subscribers during lockdown. Companies Mentioned in This Article

7 Energy Stocks to Buy On This Historical Dip[1]It may seem hard to believe, but the current chaos in the energy 
sector, and oil stocks, in particular, will pass. The novel coronavirus that has birthed a global pandemic is being 
compared to the Spanish Flu of 1918. Of course, when you have once in a century event, it's difficult to look back in 
history and make an apples-to-apples comparison to our current situation. This isn't to minimize our current 
situation. It's simply to say that the market is forward-looking, but it's also emotional. And it also hates uncertainty. 
In a typical economic downturn, demand decreases, and investors are advised to 'buy the dip.' But in the current 
environment, demand has been destroyed. Millions of Americans are being asked, and in some cases ordered, to 
stay home. And this simply means that oil demand is down. And investors are looking at prices that are, in some 
cases, at all-time lows. The trading app Robinhood is frequented by millennial investors. And according to the latest 
information, many investors are trying to buy the dip on old guard oil stocks. That may be a mistake. But the energy 
sector is about more than just oil stocks. There are several companies that are holding their own in the current 
environment. And that means when the economy opens up, these companies will be well-positioned for further 
growth. Currently, the volatility and uncertainty surrounding energy stocks make them a poor choice for growth 
investors. However, many of these companies in this presentation offer a secure dividend that, along with the 
potential for capital appreciation, can make them a solid play for income investors. View the "7 Energy Stocks to

Airline Shares Under Pressure as UK Confirms 14-Day Mandatory

 Airline shares traded lower after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed plans for a 14-day mandatory 
quarantine period for people flying into the country as part of a phased easing of lockdown measures.   
Shares of EasyJet, the biggest budget airline in the UK, dropped by 8%. Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L), which is the 
largest low-cost carrier in Europe, and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L), the biggest budget airline in central and eastern Europe, 
also declined as an extension of the restrictions on travel would further delay the industry's recovery.
Airlines are among the hardest-hit sectors in the COVID-19 pandemic as lockdown measures and social distancing 
hit demand for travel. While the UK is joining the growing group of countries that are easing restrictions to help 
revive growth, it is adopting a cautious stance as the infection rate, known as R, is said to be in a range of 0.5% to 
0.9%. If the rate increases to more than 1% -- which is possible due to a lower headroom -- then that would imply 
the pandemic is once again growing.
In a speech late on Sunday, Johnson confirmed quarantine plans to stop a second wave of the COVID-19 
pandemic. The prime minister's office, which has reportedly said the rules won't apply to travelers from France, is 
yet to confirm whether the decision would also be applicable to inbound traffic through the Channel Tunnel that 
connects the UK with mainland Europe via a train network.
"To prevent re-infection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time - with transmission significantly 
lower - to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air," Johnson said in a televised address to the 
nation.
Analysts at Citi were cited as saying in a report from Marketwatch that EasyJet may have to raise between 700 
million pounds to 1 billion pounds ($868.8 million to 1.24 billion) following the UK's decision to impose a two-week 
quarantine on incoming travelers, possibly as soon as the end of May.

Meanwhile, Colombia-based Avianca (AVH) on Sunday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in US Bankruptcy 
Court for the Southern District of New York due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on its businesses. It said 
consolidated revenue has declined by more than 80% since being grounded in March due to implemented 
lockdowns and travel bans to help stop the transmission of the virus.
Separately, Reuters reported early on Monday, citing local news agency Yonhap, South Korea's largest airline 
Korean Air will decide on Wednesday whether to sell up to about 1 trillion won ($820.2 million) in shares at a board 
meeting to boost its finances amid the global health crisis.

A number of European carriers have set out plans to restore schedules decimated by the coronavirus crisis.
Lufthansa Group said its repatriation schedule would end on May 31 and 80 aircraft would be reactivated in June, 
doubling the number of aircraft currently operating.
Lufthansa, Eurowings and SWISS will collectively fly to 106 destinations next month, with flights resuming to 
destinations including Crete (HER), Mallorca (PMI), Rostock (RLG) and Sylt (GWT).
The group said the additional services were in response to "the growing interest of customers in air travel, following 
the gradual easing of restrictions and limitations in the German federal states and entry regulations of other 
countries in Europe."
"We sense a great desire and longing among people to travel again," executive board member Harry Hohmeister 
added. "Hotels and restaurants are slowly opening, and visits to friends and family are in some cases being allowed 
again."
SWISS will operate about 10-15% of its intended timetable in June, with approximately 140 weekly flights from 
Zurich (ZRH) to 30 destinations in Europe, and approximately 40 weekly flights from Geneva (GVA) to 14 
destinations in Europe. In addition, the airline will still serve the three weekly long-haul flights to New York Newark 
(EWR).
ULCC Ryanair plans to resume three London Stansted (STN) routes over the coming weeks. From May 15, the 
carrier will operate 3X-weekly flights to Bucharest (OTP) and Sofia (SOF), with daily service to Porto (OPO) starting 
on May 22.
"Our current limited schedule continues to maintain vital links across Europe to facilitate our passengers and their 
families to deal with emergencies that may require urgent travel over the coming days and weeks," Ryanair senior 
communications manager Alejandra Ruiz said.
"At this time, we expect scheduled flights to return sometime in July. We support the action taken by EU 
governments to combat the virus, and we now hope there is a coordinated plan to lift travel restrictions when 
Europe is ready to return flying once COVID-19 is defeated, which will hopefully be sooner rather than later."
Some European airlines are planning to restore flights
Air Serbia plans to resume a limited scheduled passenger air transport services on May 18, increasing to a 
comprehensive schedule on June 1. The flag-carrier stressed flights would "depend on the decisions and guidelines 
of national, foreign, and international civil aviation authorities and on the lifting of the flight bans, evolution of travel 
restrictions and health measurements to countries served by Air Serbia."
The carrier expects its schedule to "remain strong" for operations to Brussels, Bucharest, Frankfurt, Kiev, 
Krasnodar, London, Nice, Paris, Podgorica, Sarajevo, Skopje, Sofia, Tirana, Vienna, Zadar, Zagreb and Zurich
However, flights to Amman, Beirut, Cairo, Chisinau, Florence, Geneva, Helsinki, Lviv, Malta, Rijeka and Rostov on 
Don will remain temporarily suspended.
Czech Airlines also plans to gradually resume operations from May 18, with plans to fly from Prague (PRG) to 
Amsterdam (AMS), Frankfurt (FRA), Paris (CDG) and Stockholm (ARN).
Effective May 24, the carrier intends to resume operations on its Kiev (IEV) route, with Odessa (ODS) flights to 
follow the next day, provided mandatory quarantine restrictions are terminated in Ukraine, as currently scheduled. 
On 25 May 2020, flights to OTP will also resume.
Alitalia has this week filed planned service resumption on additional domestic routes. From May 18, it will serve

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's mouthy boss, put it best: social distancing on planes is idiotic. That is of little 
consequence to frustrated travellers desperate to visit their villas in the south of France for the same cost as their 
trips last year.
Biomedically and financially, keeping middle seats empty in planes is up there with chocolate teapots. Suppose - 
wildly - that social distancing worked in a confined space and toddlers kept to their seats and everyone wiped down 
overhead luggage after use. The two-metre restriction would mean losing more than middle seats; passengers 
could no longer be close to those behind or in front of them either. On some industry estimates that means 
emptying seven seats per passenger.
Take a Boeing 747 with 345 seats.
Assume it can keep all its first-class and half its business-class seats; slice sixsevenths of the remainder (14 + 26 + 
40 = 80) and you get a plane that is threequarters empty. Applying similar maths to one of Ryanair's 189-seaters 
would fill say 35 seats, or a fifth of the plane.
These numbers are far below the 70-75 per cent load factor Iata, the industry's trade body, reckons airlines need to 
break even. Slashing payroll bills - even with the thousands of job cuts being announced almost daily - will not 
cover a shortfall that wide. Six European airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa, have under five months of 
liquidity left, according to analysts at Redburn.
In order to square on-board social distancing with profitability, airlines would need to jack up ticket prices threefold. 
Thus a London-Dublin hop, now advertised at (EURO)23.46 on Ryanair, would need to rise to (EURO)70; a British 
Airlines/distancing: flights of fancy
Airways London-Hong Kong return currently advertised at £551 would need to tip £1,600. Of course, the more 
prices rise, the fewer the passengers.
Horrid economics for airlines have always been with us. Warren Buffett, conceding his penchant for airline 
investments was misplaced, is a lagging indicator. When BA listed in 1987, after a period fraught with losses and 
litigation, UK institutional investors were "unenthusiastic". A government postmortem at the time pointed the finger 
at "the tone of press comment which portrayed airlines as a riskier form of investment".
As then, severe restructuring is required. Some painful steps, such as mass job cuts and bankruptcies, have begun. 
That will set the stage for a slow recovery - at least until the next crisis.

Lufthansa to double schedule in June, including holiday destinations

Body
Germany's Lufthansa is to roughly double its schedule in June, putting 160 planes into the air to carry passengers 
to 106 domestic and foreign destinations, the airline announced from its Frankfurt headquarters on Friday.
Lufthansa, along with its subsidiaries Swiss and Eurowings, will include many traditional holiday destinations in the 
schedule, including Crete and Majorca in the Mediterranean and Sylt and Rostock on the northern German 
coastline.
Around 600 planes that belong to the group will remain grounded.
On Thursday, the Lufthansa Group, Europe's second largest airline after Ryanair, confirmed that it was in talks with 
the German government regarding a bailout package of 9 billion euros (9.7 billion dollars).  
In exchange for the stabilization package, the government has proposed taking a stake in the company of up to 25 
per cent plus one share, the airline stated in a regulatory release, as well as one seat on the supervisory board.

Body
Airline after airline across the globe is reporting drastic falls in passengers and revenue amid the coronavirus 
pandemic that has brought domestic and international air travel to a virtual standstill. Businesses and governments 
are just coming to terms with the true costs of saving them.
The global air travel industry had been expected to grow by more than 3 per cent this year, but that was prior to the 
standstill caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Instead of demand for global passenger seats growing by 67 million passengers in 2020, the International Civil 
Aviation Authority (ICAO) estimates that demand will drop by between 805 million and almost 1.5 billion passenger 
seats as country after country introduces travel bans to stem the spread of the virus.
Europe is particularly hard-hit, the UN body said. Travel restrictions are expected to cripple the traditionally busy 
summer travel season.
Millions of jobs hang in the balance warns the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 
about 290 airlines. According to IATA, the aviation industry supports 65.5 million jobs around the world, including 
10.5 million people who work at airports and airlines.
Airline after airline has presented dismal quarterly reports and plans to cut jobs. 
Airlines, governments weigh costs as pandemic keeps planes idling
That includes Virgin Atlantic, which this week said 3,150 jobs could go. Chief executive Shai Weiss said the airline 
was forced to cut costs to "safeguard [its] future and emerge a sustainably profitable business" by next year.
Last week, British Airways announced plans for up to 12,000 redundancies, while low-cost carrier Ryanair warned 
that it could cut up to 3,000 jobs.
Normal services are not expected to resume any time soon.
The owner of British Airways said on Thursday it expects the impact of the pandemic on the aviation industry to last 
at least three years, with no "meaningful return" to normal services until July at the earliest.
IATA this week warned that leaving middle seats free to reduce infection risk would either lead to soaring ticket 
prices or to bankrupt airlines. Such measures would push the maximum passenger load in aircraft below the break-
even level of 77 per cent, according to the industry umbrella group.
"Eliminating the middle seat will raise costs. If that can be offset with higher fares, the era of affordable travel will 
come to an end," IATA chief Alexandre de Juniac said.
IATA's safety proposals include temperature screenings, safe boarding procedures and increased aircraft cleaning.
John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, told British lawmakers on Wednesday that the 
government needs to agree on common international standards by the end of May, especially with the EU and the 
US.
"The key issue [for passengers] is whether they will be allowed into the country that they will be going to, and 
whether they will be allowed back," Holland-Kaye said, adding that continuing quarantine will "kill the [aviation] 
industry."
Airlines across Europe have also sought and received state support, including loans and credits to weather the 
storm. 
The Polish government was on Thursday among the latest to announce plans to back LOT, the country's flagship 
airline.  
"The interventions of the various national states, aimed at safeguarding individual flag carriers, have a perverse 
effect, which is to distort the market. There should be aid for the industry, but it must be coordinated by the 
European Union," wrote Andrea Giuricin, an Italian airline analyst, in the Il Foglio daily.
Some carriers were already in trouble before the standstill, having racked up huge debts. Those include low-cost 
Norwegian Air and its expansion plans or Italy's near-bankrupt Alitalia, which saw revenue in the April 1-23 period 
fall by 97 per cent.
Carsten Spohr, head of airline German Lufthansa, Europe's largest carrier, this week warned against incurring high 
debts amid negotiations about a huge state bailout.
German airports are losing half a billion euros (539.2 million dollars) in revenue every month due to the coronavirus 
crisis, an industry body warned on Thursday, calling for state aid.
"Air travel does not happen without the infrastructure on the ground," Stefan Schulte, president of the ADV airport 
association, said.
The European Commission this week approved French loans worth 7 billion euros to help Air France, noting that 
the aviation giant would otherwise face the risk of bankruptcy.
French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said Paris wanted environmental commitments from Air France - part of 
the Air France-KLM group - in return for the backing.
Airlines, governments weigh costs as pandemic keeps planes idling
"When you can travel by train in less than two and a half hours, there is no justification for taking a plane," he said.
The trend with growing state involvement was "interesting" as it marked a shift from previous privatization waves, 
said Jean-Marie Skoglund, senior advisor with the Swedish Transport Agency.
He added that, when air travel eventually resumes, it was "important that the same restrictions apply for all airlines, 
at least within tbe EU."
Scandinavian airline SAS also received the EU executive's blessing for a three-year credit guarantee for 335 million 
dollars, mainly guaranteed by its main shareholders - the Swedish and Danish governments.
Sweden, however, did not wish to use the funding to target a single company, Tomas Eneroth, minister of 
infrastructure, told Stockholm daily Dagens Nyheter.
He said the airline sector as a whole should become more environmentally friendly. Possible measures include 
promoting bio fuel and investments in electric-powered aircraft. 
Meanwhile, Greenpeace and pressure groups like Transport & Environment that track emissions generated by air 
travel have called for governments to use state support as leverage. 
"Injecting taxpayers' money into one of the world's most polluting industries - with no strings attached - makes no 
sense at all," said Lorelei Limousin, Greenpeace EU climate campaigner.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) on Friday filed with European Union judges urging them to terminate Sweden's 
approved 455 million euro ($491 million) loan guarantees for airlines amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Bloomberg 
News reported on Tuesday.
The airline company claims that the Swedish program discriminates against companies based outside the country 
by limiting state guarantees on loans to only airlines with a Swedish commercial aviation license on Jan. 1. Ryanair 
Holdings raise similar concerns about support packages in France and Denmark.
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary also accused member states' governments of providing support for only 
favored airlines.
The commission intends to defend its decision in court.

Virgin Atlantic to slash third of staff and leave Gatwick; ? UK airline cuts

Virgin Atlantic is preparing to cut almost a third of its 10,000 workforce and close its London Gatwick operations as 
the airline scales back to survive the coronavirus crisis.
The British airline yesterday warned that it would take up to three years to return to 2019 traffic levels and 
announced plans to cut up to 3,150 jobs.
It will exit its base at Gatwick airport, where it has been headquartered for the past 35 years, and move leisure 
flying to London Heathrow as well as keeping its base at Manchester airport.
Virgin Atlantic's move to reshape the business comes after a dramatic week for the aviation industry, with 
thousands of planned jobs cuts at British Airways, Ryanair, Scandinavian airline SAS and at the aerospace 
manufacturer Rolls-Royce.
In an internal post to staff, seen by the Financial Times, Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive, warned that 
current cost measures and support packages were "not enough".
"If we are to safeguard our future and emerge from this crisis a sustainably profitable business, now is the time for 
further decisive action to reduce our costs and preserve cash," he wrote.
Virgin Atlantic to slash third of staff and leave Gatwick; ? UK airline cuts back to survive crisis ? Aviation sector 
suffers stormy week
Virgin Group, which owns 51 per cent of Virgin Atlantic, is racing to find new investors in the next month as the 
airline fights for its survival. It has been in talks with the UK government for the past month over a £500m bailout of 
commercial loans and guarantees.
However, its initial plan was rejected last month after the government was left unimpressed by its failure to seek 
investment elsewhere. It continues to be in "constructive" talks with the government.
Mr Weiss wrote: "It has been clear throughout that any potential investor, including HM Government, expects us to 
have taken all possible self-help measures as a precondition to funding."
In the past few days, airline groups and aerospace manufacturers have grown increasingly pessimistic over 
recovery.
Last week, British Airways revealed plans to cut almost 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong workforce, while Ryanair 
said it would axe up to 15 per cent. SAS said it would permanently cut half, 5,000, of its staff. Like BA and Ryanair, 
Virgin Atlantic has also furloughed staff via the government's Covid-19 job retention scheme. Rolls-Royce 
announced plans for up to 8,000 job cuts.
The move to close its Gatwick base will come as a further blow to the airport after BA signalled it could also bear 
the brunt of its job cuts amid warnings its operation may not return following the coronavirus crisis.
Virgin Atlantic plans to retain its slots at Gatwick by leasing them to other airlines, giving it the option to return when 
the aviation market returns to normal.
It will also cut the number of aircraft types it flies as part of its cost-cutting measures. It will no longer use its seven 
747-400s, and plans to retire its four A330-200 aircraft in early 2022. This will see it reduce its 43-strong fleet to 36, 
and leave just three - more efficient and environmentally friendly - plane types: A350, B787 and A330-300s.
Separately, it plans to rebrand Virgin Holidays as Virgin Atlantic Holidays and also plans to close about 15 per cent 
of its branded stores in 2020. It intends to focus instead on its partnership with Next, the retailer, and online selling.

Virgin Atlantic is preparing to cut almost a third of its 10,000 workforce and close its Gatwick operations as the 
airline scales back to survive the coronavirus crisis.
The airline warned it would take up to three years to return to 2019 traffic levels and announced plans yesterday to 
cut up to 3,150 jobs.
Its drive to reshape the business was announced after a turbulent week for the aviation industry, with thousands of 
job cuts planned at British Airways, Ryanair, Scandinavian airline SAS and aerospace manufacturers Boeing and 
Rolls-Royce.
Virgin Atlantic will exit Gatwick airport, where it has been based for the past 35 years, and move leisure flying to 
Heathrow while keeping its presence at Manchester airport.
The move is a further blow to Gatwick after BA signalled the airport could bear the brunt of its job cuts amid 
warnings it might not resume operations there following the coronavirus crisis.
In an internal post to staff, seen by the Financial Times, Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive, warned that 
cost measures and support packages so far were "not enough".

"If we are to safeguard our future and emerge from this crisis a sustainably profitable business, now is the time for

Virgin Group, which owns 51 per cent of Virgin Atlantic, is racing to find investors within the month as the airline 
fights for its survival.
It has also been in talks with the government over a £500m bailout of commercial loans and guarantees. However, 
its initial plan was rejected last month after the government was left unimpressed by its failure to seek investment 
elsewhere. It continues to be in "constructive" talks with the government. "It has been clear throughout that any 
potential investor, including HM Government, expects us to have taken all possible self-help measures as a 
precondition to funding," wrote Mr Weiss. Airline groups and aerospace manufacturers have grown ever more 
pessimistic for recovery. Last week, BA revealed plans to cut almost 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong workforce, 
while Ryanair said it would axe up to 15 per cent. SAS said it would permanently cut half, or 5,000, of its staff.
Like BA and Ryanair, Virgin Atlantic has furloughed staff through the government's Covid-19 job retention scheme. 
It plans to retain its slots at Gatwick by leasing them to other airlines, giving it the option to return when the aviation 
market returns to normal.
Gatwick airport was "saddened" by the news but said it would work with Virgin Atlantic to look at restarting 
operations when demand returned.
"We remain very optimistic about the long-term prospects of Gatwick ... and having remained open throughout this 
pandemic we are in a strong position to extend our current operations quickly to meet demand," it said.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/heathrow-to-begin-temperature-screening-trial-in-bid-to-reduce-coronavirus-
risk/Heathrow is to trial temperature screening passengers, a move aimed at reducing the risk of passengers 
contracting or transmitting Covid-19 while travelling.The measure was deployed by many other major airports 
around the world several weeks ago and Heathrow has been criticised for not introducing screening earlier. Chief 
executive John Holland-Kaye said it will trial technologies and processes which could form the basis of a common 
international standard for health screening at airports in a bid to encourage passengers to return to flying. 
The first trial will be launched in the next two weeks and will involve using cameras which are capable of monitoring 
the temperatures of people. Cameras will initially be used in the airport's immigration halls, but could be deployed in 
areas for departures, connections and airport staff searches. The airline industry has been decimated by the 
coronavirus pandemic as travel ground to a half with many around the world struggling to survive as passenger 
number tumble. On Tuesday, Virgin Atlantic announced it was laying off a third of its workforce, offloading 737s and 
pulling out of Gatwick Airport[1] amid the ongoing crisis. The news came a week after British Airways said it was set 
to make up to 12,000 workers redundant[2]. The airline also indicated it may pull out of Gatwick, the UK's second 
busiest airport, even after borders reopen. A peak times of the year BA operates 180 flights a day, accounting for 
one in five flights. Budget airline Ryanair said it expects to cut 3,000 jobs[3], including pilots and cabin crew, from its 
workforce. The airline said its flights will remain grounded until 'at least July' and passenger numbers will not return 
to 2019 levels 'until summer 2022 at the earliest'. Mr Holland-Kaye said: 'Aviation is the cornerstone of the UK 
economy, and to restart the economy the Government needs to help restart aviation. 'The UK has the world's third-
largest aviation sector, offering the platform for the Government to take a lead in agreeing a common international 
standard for aviation health with our main trading partners. 'This standard is key to minimising transmission of 
Covid-19 across borders, and the technology we are trialling at Heathrow could be part of the solution.' Heathrow is 
also considering the use of UV light to quickly sanitise security trays, and contact-free security screening 
equipment. The airport pledged to share data from its trials with the Government and the rest of the aviation 
industry to help develop the common standard it is seeking.Photo: Library Photo of Singapore airport carrying out

Virgin Atlantic to cut 3,150 jobs as airlines face 'death spiral'
Virgin Atlantic to cut 3,150 jobs as airlines face 'death spiral'

Virgin Atlantic airline announced plans to cut 3,150 jobs on Tuesday, in the latest blow to an industry rocked by the 
severe impact of global efforts to curb the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss said the airline was forced to cut costs to "safeguard [its] future and 
emerge a sustainably profitable business" by next year.
"This will mean taking steps to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic in line with demand," Weiss said in a statement.
"We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years ago, but none has been as devastating as Covid-19 
and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many," he said.
Virgin's move followed British Airways' announcement last week of plans for up to 12,000 redundancies, and a 
warning from low-cost carrier Ryanair that it could cut up to 3,000 jobs.
"Why is the government sitting on its hands while aviation plunges further towards a death spiral?" Brian Strutton, 
general secretary of pilots' trade union BALPA, said following Virgin's announcement.
BALPA wrote an open letter to the government on Monday, calling for urgent action to mitigate the "crisis in 
aviation."
Virgin group founder Richard Branson warned last month that the airline needed government loans to keep 
operating.
Asked about the problems in the industry on Tuesday, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said 
the government "continues to work closely with the [aviation] sector."

The government is "willing to consider the situation of individual firms once all other government schemes and 
commercial options have been explored, including raising capital from existing investors," the spokesman said.
Virgin vowed to "explore all available options to obtain additional external funding," adding that it was in 
"constructive discussions with several stakeholders, including [the] government."
Weiss noted that Virgin had taken similar cost-cutting measures after the "9/11" terrorist attacks on the United 
States in 2001 and the 2008 global financial crisis, but many redundant staff were "back flying with us within a 
couple of years."
Virgin said it plans to suspend operations at London's Gatwick, Britain's second-busiest airport, and move them to 
the larger Heathrow airport.
It said wants to "retain its slot portfolio at London Gatwick, so it can return in line with customer demand."
BA also wrote to staff last week to warn that it might not resume operations at Gatwick, the Financial Times 
reported.

May 05, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Virgin Atlantic 
will cut over 3,000 jobs -- around a third of staff -- as the coronavirus pandemic grounds planes worldwide, the 
British carrier part-owned by tycoon Richard Branson announced Tuesday.It comes one week after British Airways 
announced plans to slash up to 12,000 jobs because of the COVID-19 fallout.With the virus having decimated 
international air travel -- Ryanair on Friday said it would axe 3,000 jobs -- Virgin said it was obliged to make its own 
cuts to preserve its financial future, adding it was in talks with the UK government about potential support.Virgin 
Atlantic said in a statement that "for the airline to emerge from the crisis, regrettably it must reduce the number of 
people employed and today the company is announcing a planned reduction of 3,150 jobs across all 
functions".Chief executive Shai Weiss said it was "crucial" the airline returned to profit in 2021."After 9/11 and the 
global financial crisis, we took similar painful measures but fortunately many members of our team were back flying 
with us within a couple of years. "Depending on how long the pandemic lasts and the period of time our planes are 
grounded for, hopefully the same will happen this time," he added. 
Virgin said it would restructure company operations as a result of the job losses, including pausing flights in and out 
of London's Gatwick airport.Virgin said it would switch the flights to London's Heathrow airport, "with the intention of 
retaining its slot portfolio at London Gatwick, so it can return in line with customer demand".The announcements 
come around two weeks after Branson warned that Virgin Atlantic would collapse unless it received financial aid 
from the UK government to weather the coronavirus crisis.Virgin is reportedly seeking ?500 million ($612 million, 
564 million euros) in state help. Virgin Atlantic is reportedly seeking more than half a billion dollars in state help 
saying it has taken a battering over the economic fallout of coronavirus Photo: AFP / Ben STANSALL British no-frills 
airline EasyJet recently secured a ?600-million loan from the British government, which is dealing with airlines on a 
case-by-case basis rather than heeding Virgin's demand for a multi-billion-pound state-funded pot for the entire UK 
airline sector.In a recent letter to staff, billionaire Branson referred to "lots of comments" about his wealth and a duty 
to prop up Virgin Atlantic and offer financial help to staff from his own pocket.But he insisted that figures being 
published regarding his net worth were based on the value of Virgin businesses before the coronavirus pandemic, 
rather than "cash in a bank account ready to withdraw".BALPA, a British union representing pilots, hit out at 
Tuesday's "devastating" announcement that it said would affect 426 pilots."Our members and all staff in Virgin 
Atlantic will be shocked by the scale of this bombshell. We will be challenging Virgin very hard to justify this," said 
BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton."Government should call a moratorium on job losses in aviation and lead a 
planned recovery," he added.bcp/cdw

       Virgin Atlantic said it will cut 3,150 jobs, due to the coronavirus crisis that  affects the entire travel and aviation 
industry. The airline will move its flying programme from London Gatwick to London Heathrow, with the intention of 
retaining its slot portfolio at London Gatwick.
 The airline said it is working closely with unions BALPA and Unite, and a company-wide consultation period of 45 
days begins today.
 Shai Weiss, CEO, Virgin Atlantic said, "We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years ago, but 
none has been as devastating as Covid-19 and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many."
 Following the pattern of previous crises including 9/11 and the Global Financial Crisis, capacity across the aviation 
industry will significantly reduce, with recovery to pre-crisis levels expected to take up to three years, Virgin Atlantic 
said.
 Virgin Atlantic said it will no longer use all of its seven 747-400s, with four A330-200 aircraft retiring in early 2022 
as planned. By 2022 the simplified, greener fleet will comprise of 36 twin engine aircraft reducing CO2/RTK 
emissions by an estimated further 10%, building on the 18% efficiency already achieved between 2007-2019.
 Recently, Ryanair Airlines had said it plans a restructuring and job loss program to commence from July 2020, 
which may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs.
 Last week, British Airways announced plans to cut nearly 12,000 jobs at the UK carrier as Covid-19 pandemic 
continues to wreak havoc on the aviation industry.

       European stocks rebounded on Tuesday after falling sharply the previous day on concerns about the 
coronavirus's impact on earnings and rising U.S.-China tensions. 
 Sentiment improved somewhat as several countries across Europe and the Middle East eased lockdown 
restrictions. 
 Meanwhile, Germany's top court has ruled that the European Central Bank's mass bond-buying to stabilize the 
eurozone partly violates the German constitution.
 German judges gave the ECB three months' time to adopt a new decision that demonstrates in a comprehensible 
and substantiated manner that the monetary policy objectives pursued by the ECB are not disproportionate.
 The pan European Stoxx 600 rose 1.5 percent to 333.37 after plunging 2.7 percent on Monday. 
 The German DAX, France's CAC 40 index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 were up between 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent. 
 Adecco Group shares rose 0.7 percent. The staffing firm swung to a loss in the first quarter, but said there are early 
signs of a gradual stabilization. 
 Copenhagen-based jewellery maker Pandora surged 8 percent. The company said it is in a strong financial 
position to sustain a prolonged Covid-19 crisis. 
 Spanish energy major Repsol S.A. jumped 8.4 percent after its adjusted net profit beat forecasts. 
 Luxury fashion house Hugo Boss plunged 3.5 percent. After posting a loss in the first quarter, the company said it 
expects the impact of the coronavirus pandemic to get worse before it gets better.
European Shares Rebound As Lockdowns Ease
 Hi-tech equipment manufacturer Manz soared 8 percent after its first-quarter earnings before interest and taxes 
improved significantly to 3.5 million euros from previous year's 0.6 million euros. 
 Similarly, real estate company Vonovia rallied 7 percent after reporting a rise in first-quarter profit and backing its 
full-year outlook. 
 Meal-kit delivery firm HelloFresh surged 6 percent after raising its 2020 forecast.
 French lender BNP Paribas rose 3.2 percent after reporting a rise in securities services revenues in the first 
quarter. 
 EssilorLuxottica gained 1.7 percent. The eye-wear conglomerate reported a 10 percent fall in first-quarter revenue 
and warned that the impact of the crisis will likely be stronger in the second quarter.
 Total SA shares jumped 6 percent as oil prices surged further and the company maintained its dividend despite 
reporting a sharp fall in first-quarter net adjusted profit.
 Budget airline Ryanair Holdings rose about 1 percent despite posting dismal trading performance for April. 
 Property company LondonMetric Property gained 2 percent after announcing it will raise GBP100 million to fund 
acquisitions.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) on Tuesday reported a 99.6% decline in April passenger traffic to 40,000 customers 
from 13.5 million in the same month last year. 
The Irish-based budget carrier said it operated 600 scheduled flights last month, including a number of rescue and 
medical flights on behalf of various European Union (EU) governments.
The company expects to carry minimal traffic in May and June due to imposed lockdowns and flight bans in many 
EU countries amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

BOC Aviation taps parent's funds for assault on leasing market Airlines

BOC Aviation, one of the biggest aircraft leasing companies, is tapping parent company Bank of China for funds to 
help it snare a greater share of the multibillion-dollar industry as even the strongest airlines seek to raise cash by 
selling off their jets.
Robert Martin, chief executive of the world's fifth-biggest lessor by owned aircraft value, said BOC Aviation had 
begun to draw down funds from a $2bn "backstop" revolving credit facility, provided by the bank, for the first time 
since 2011.
Last week the group also concluded a $1bn five-year bond issue, testing the market's appetite for exposure to a 
sector that is struggling to survive the collapse in global air travel as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Before 
the bond issue liquidity stood at $3.6bn.
The Singapore-based company intended to move quickly to acquire aircraft "at good prices with long leases" of 12-
16 years, Mr Martin said. He insisted that the new financing was not because the group needed cash to cope with a 
wave of requests for rental deferrals from the its 90 airline customers.
"We are using the opportunity to focus on the best airlines around the world. Better-credit people who previously 
would have paid cash are now coming to people like us for funding support," he told the Financial Times. "By the 
end of April we will have done $5bn of additional sale and leasebacks."
BOC Aviation taps parent's funds for assault on leasing market Airlines
Two weeks ago, BOC Aviation secured United Airlines, one of the world's largest carriers, as a client when it 
agreed to buy and immediately lease back 22 of the airline's aircraft.
The deal, which involves six 787 twin aisles and 16 737 Max single aisles, is estimated to be worth several billion 
dollars. In recent weeks, at the height of the pandemic, it also completed sale and leaseback transactions with 
Cathay Pacific and American Airlines.
BOC Aviation's push comes as the aircraft leasing industry faces a severe squeeze on revenues and the threat of 
impairments to aircraft values as a result of the crisis. Avolon, the third-biggest lessor by value of owned aircraft, 
said last month that 80 per cent of its customers were seeking rental holidays.
Carriers such as Ryanair, British Airways and Lufthansa have announced thousands of job losses while Virgin 
Australia went into administration last month. Norwegian Air Shuttle is planning a rescue debt-for-equity swap. The 
crisis marks a sharp reversal on a decade of expansion in the aviation industry, which has fuelled a boom in aircraft 
financing. According to Ascend by Cirium, the aviation consultancy, more than 100 new operating lessors have 
entered the sector in the past decade. However, the global nature of the aviation crisis, with more than twothirds of 
the world's fleet in storage and several airlines asking for government bailouts, makes placing aircraft with new 
customers more difficult.

Last week the group also concluded a $1bn five-year bond issue, testing the market's appetite for exposure to a 
sector that is struggling to survive the collapse in global air travel as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Before 
the bond issue liquidity stood at $3.6bn.
The Singapore-based company intended to move quickly to acquire aircraft "at good prices with long leases" of 12-
16 years, Mr Martin said. He insisted that the new financing was not because the group needed cash to cope with a 
wave of requests for rental deferrals from the its 90 airline customers.
"We are using the opportunity to focus on the best airlines around the world. Better-credit people who previously 
would have paid cash are now coming to people like us for funding support," he told the Financial Times. "By the 
end of April we will have done $5bn of additional sale and leasebacks."
BOC Aviation taps parent's funds for assault on leasing market Airlines
Two weeks ago, BOC Aviation secured United Airlines, one of the world's largest carriers, as a client when it 
agreed to buy and immediately lease back 22 of the airline's aircraft.
The deal, which involves six 787 twin aisles and 16 737 Max single aisles, is estimated to be worth several billion 
dollars. In recent weeks, at the height of the pandemic, it also completed sale and leaseback transactions with 
Cathay Pacific and American Airlines.
BOC Aviation's push comes as the aircraft leasing industry faces a severe squeeze on revenues and the threat of 
impairments to aircraft values as a result of the crisis. Avolon, the third-biggest lessor by value of owned aircraft, 
said last month that 80 per cent of its customers were seeking rental holidays.
Carriers such as Ryanair, British Airways and Lufthansa have announced thousands of job losses while Virgin 
Australia went into administration last month. Norwegian Air Shuttle is planning a rescue debt-for-equity swap. The 
crisis marks a sharp reversal on a decade of expansion in the aviation industry, which has fuelled a boom in aircraft 
financing. According to Ascend by Cirium, the aviation consultancy, more than 100 new operating lessors have 
entered the sector in the past decade. However, the global nature of the aviation crisis, with more than twothirds of 
the world's fleet in storage and several airlines asking for government bailouts, makes placing aircraft with new 
customers more difficult.

BOC Aviation, one of the biggest aircraft leasing companies, is tapping parent company Bank of China for funds to 
help it snare a greater share of the multibillion-dollar industry as even the strongest airlines seek to raise cash by 
selling off their jets.

Irish airline Aer Lingus has told unions it is seeking staff cuts of around 20% due to the coronavirus pandemic, a 
source close to the talks told Reuters.
Aer Lingus, part of International Airlines Group (IAG) , which also owns British Airways, declined to comment, 
saying it was "continuing to communicate directly with our employees and engage with their representative bodies."
Cuts of 20% would represent around 800-900 staff, with management promising to offer a voluntary redundancy 
program, the source said.
British Airways is seeking to cut up to 12,000 jobs, or more than a quarter of its workforce, as it slashes costs to 
weather the crisis that has grounded aircraft around the world.
The proposed cuts come as rival Ryanair said on Friday it would cut 15% of its staff and reduce the pay of the 
remaining workers by 20%.
Irish national broadcaster RTE reported earlier that Aer Lingus informed union representatives of the plan at a 
meeting on Friday. (Reuters)

       Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said its group traffic for the month of April declined 99.6 percent to 0.04 
million passengers from last year's 13.5 million passengers. The decline was due to airspace closure amid 
coronavirus or Covid-19 crisis.
 Ryanair said it operated 600 scheduled flights (75,501 budget) in April including a number of rescue and medical 
flights on behalf of various European union governments.
 Ryanair expects to carry minimal traffic during the months of May and June as well, due to multiple EU Govt flight 
bans and restrictions.

View original post here[2]. The future of economy class cabins on commercial jets could be reshaped because of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. New cabin seating arrangements have already been conceptualized by an Italian design 
firm this week that shows plastic shields and backward seats. 
 Aviointeriors has designed a "hygienic screen to cocoon passengers and keep them separate from their neighbors. 
Let's take a look at Glassafe, a potential post-COVID-19 economy cabin modification," reported Simple Flying[3].    
Glassafe is a kit-level solution for airlines that can be installed on existing seats to make close passenger seating a 
reality while abiding by social distancing rules.    The company has also rolled out another concept. It is called 
Janus, a row of three seats where every middle seat is positioned backwards.    As shown in this view, Janus has a 
"wrap-around transparent barrier envelopes each passenger, providing a big plastic cocoon that protects from 
germs, bad breath, and fights for the armrest," said Simple Flying.    The biggest challenge at the moment for major 
airlines is to make customers feel safe in a closed environment. And perhaps by restructuring the cabin with social 
distancing in mind, plastic shields and backwards seats could be the solution.  We noted on Friday morning[4] that 
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary was unhappy with "idiotic" in-flight social distancing rules. He said Irish authorities 
forced his planes to eliminate the middle seat to comply with new regulations.  Perhaps O'Leary should give 
Aviointeriors 
a 
call 
about 
the 
Janus 
seating 
arrangement

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/virgin-atlantic-to-axe-3000-jobs-in-battle-for-survival/Virgin 
Atlantic 
has 
announced that it is to axe up to a third of its workforce as it battles to secure new funding that would enable it to 
survive the coronavirus pandemic.The airline majority-owned by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group has announced 
that it is cutting 3,150 jobs in a move that will spell the end of its long-running operations at London's Gatwick 
Airport. Trade unions and staff were being briefed on the redundancies on Tuesday lunchtime, with an external 
announcement expected imminently, according to one official. 
The restructuring of Virgin Atlantic's workforce will follow a week of brutal job losses across Britain's aviation 
industry. British Airways has begun consulting on up to 12,000 redundancies[1], while Ryanair has said it plans to 
axe 3,000 jobs. As we reported on Friday, Rolls Royce Holdings, the aircraft engine manufacturer, would reduce its 
UK workforce by about 8,000[2] people amid expectations of a protracted slump in demand because of the COVID-
19 crisis. Virgin Atlantic's restructuring is likely to be pitched by the airline's management as an important step 
towards securing hundreds of millions of pounds of new funding from private investors or the government, 
according to one union source. The company has argued that it provides essential competition to BA, and is likely 
to hold out an olive branch to staff that an eventual recovery in the airline industry's fortunes could pave the way for 
future expansion. One source said that Virgin Atlantic's announcement would include the disclosure that it was 
refocusing its operations on Heathrow and Manchester airports. That would represent a major blow to Gatwick, 
which was notified last week that BA might never resume flying from London's second-busiest airport. Virgin 
Atlantic is anticipating that customer demand will be at least 40% lower during 2020, with only a gradual recovery 
next year. The Treasury has, to date, been lukewarm about the idea of committing taxpayers' money to Virgin 
Atlantic, partly because of its ownership by billionaire Sir Richard and Delta Air Lines, a US carrier which has itself 
just been bailed out by Washington. Sir Richard made an impassioned defence of his group's financial affairs last 
month, warning that the transatlantic airline he founded in the 1980s was likely to collapse without government 
support. He has already seen Virgin Australia fall into a process called voluntary administration[3], putting 
thousands of jobs at risk. Sir Richard has been seeking hundreds of millions of pounds in the form of a commercial 
loan, as well as a government guarantee on further sums owed to it by credit card companies. Talks with private 
investors also include other forms of financing that could dilute the tycoon's 51% stake. In April, Sky News revealed 
that Heathrow Airport and some of the aviation industry's biggest manufacturers were mounting a frantic lobbying 
Virgin Atlantic axes 3,000 jobs and leaves Gatwick in battle for survival
campaign to secure taxpayer support for Virgin Atlantic. In one of the letters, John Harrison, general counsel and 
UK chairman of Airbus, warned that Virgin Atlantic's 'collapse could have an extremely negative impact on the A330 
[aircraft manufacturing] programme'. 'As you will be aware, all wings for these aircraft are designed and 
manufactured in the UK, and orders from airlines like Virgin are vital for the continuation of our business,' Mr 
Harrison wrote. The pleas from industry stakeholders underlined the extent to which Virgin Atlantic regards the 
coronavirus pandemic as an existential threat. The company, which recently received a capital injection amounting 
to more than $100m from Virgin Group, has furloughed thousands of staff and seen its top executives agree 
substantial pay cuts because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Fewer than a handful of Virgin Atlantic's planes have been 
flying since the UK lockdown began in March, when Peter Norris, Virgin Group's chairman, urged Boris Johnson to 
establish an industry-wide support package that could cost in the region of 7.5bn. Hopes in the airline industry that 
such a rescue plan might be forthcoming appeared to be dashed, however, when Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, 
indicated that state aid would be available 'only as a last resort' and after the support of existing government 
schemes and companies' existing shareholders had been pursued. He added that help would only be afforded to 
companies which had demonstrated their value to the wider UK economy and to competition in the aviation sector. 
Despite his long-stated antipathy to government rescues of airlines, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA's parent, 
International Airlines Group, sanctioned a €1bn state-backed loan for its Spanish airlines. Virgin Atlantic declined to 
comment, although it recently denied reports that its discussions with government had faltered, saying they were 
'ongoing' and that the company's 'cash position remains stable'. Read more: Virgin Atlantic axes 3,000 jobs and

this page has been deleted. An overview of the investor's market outlook and the real estate landscapeLegendary 
real estate investor Sam Zell has a true value instinct and is, in fact, nicknamed "The Grave Dancer" because he 
buys when everybody in the real estate world is getting killed. 
Zell appeared on an interview with Bloomberg TV [1]on May 5. Interestingly, just like Warren Buffett[2] (Trades[3], 
Portfolio[4]), who held the Berkshire (NYSE:BRK.A[5]) (NYSE:BRK.B[6]) meeting this past weekend, he did not buy 
during the March selloff. He also discussed what he thinks about the current environment. Despite six to seven 
weeks of lockdown, there's been very little opportunity to do transactions. Zell is sitting and watching, so not much 
is happening. There's been very little opportunity of price discovery since sellers are still thinking about prices 
available seven to eight weeks ago and buyers are seeing a different world and expect very different prices. 
Because of that disparity, nothing is happening.  We are also faced with an extreme level of uncertainty. How soon 
will anyone go to a mall? How will the reopening go? There is no comparison. This is different from the former 
crises of 1974, 1981 and 1990, which were all financial-type crises. We have no frame of reference for this type of 
crisis. At the end of interview, Zell likened it to the Great Depression that began in 1929. Even during the Great 
Recession of 2007 to 2009, there were parts of the world that were fine. In this environment, the problem is 
universal. There is not anything to reference in history that we can go back to and see which way this cpuld go.  Zell 
expects baseball games, football games, dances and social gatherings of to be off for a while. He doesn't see any 
scenario where, come Monday morning, life is back to normal. This has been an extraordinary shock to the world, 
to the U.S. and its culture.  He also has questions about airlines. How soon are you going to sit in the middle seat? 
How many airlines can survive if they can't sell the middle seat? Ryanair (RYAAY) already announced it can't 
survive if it can't sell the middle seat. There are going to be adjustments. Maybe these seats are out, but prices for 
the remaining seats are going up.  When asked about rents paid by his tenants, he is very clear. In April, everyone 
paid rent. In May, rent collecting is running at a level that you would expect no difference versus any other time. Zell 
isn't currently renting out lower-quality projects that are more likely to be impacted already. He also said they do 
offer adjustments to rent in the timing or 'whatever.' Zell believes the number one victim within real estate is going to 
be retail. There was already a lot of oversupply in retail and now it's taking a huge hit. Hospitality will be the second-
biggest victim. There was already a lot of oversupply and this is going to make things worse to a great degree. A lot 
of hotels won't be able to reopen. Everyone is focusing on when they will reopen. Nobody is focused on what it 
Sam Zell Isn't Buying Yet
costs to do so. Zell anticipates that the costs will be too great for lots of businesses. On the other end of the 
spectrum, multifamily is doing the best. Manufactured housing is doing terrific. Warehousing has been the flavor of 
the month over the past several years. Zell has a sense that this is going to reduce demand, but nothing like hotels 
or retail.  Before the virus, the argument with retail was that e-commerce would hit it. But retail always had the best 
corners. Defined as the best traffic. But if overall traffic diminishes, the best corners don't sound as great. We are 
going to end up with a lot of retail space that is falling apart or close to that. It is going to take a long time.  Working 
from home is likely going to increase post-pandemic. Zell also said he got takeout from a Michelin star restaurant, 
which he's never done before. Could that be a change in the future?  The investor said he had been buying oil and 
gas assets before Covid-19 hit. He recognizes there is a hope or trend toward sustainable fuels, but it is a long way 
from now. Combustion engines are still 95% of those being built, so the belief that oil and gas are going to 
disappear is very naive. Coal could see dramatic reductions in use within Zell's lifetime, but he doesn't think the 
same is true for other fossil fuels. In a general sense, Zell sees this very much as the Great Depression. He thinks 
people will be permanently scarred 20 years from now over this pandemic experience. Disclosure: Long Berkshire.

View original post here[2]. US equity futures, European stock markets and oil prices all fell on Monday as an 
escalating war of words between top U.S. officials and China over the origin of the coronavirus fuelled fears of a 
new trade war, derailing a rebound in global markets, while Buffett's admission he had liquidated all his airline 
stocks sent the sector tumbling.  European shares - which were closed on Friday - slumped 2.5% in mid-morning 
trading, catching up to the Friday drop in the US with sectors sensitive to economic growth including oil and gas, 
automakers and banks falling between about 4% and 5.5%. Volatility gauges for European and American blue-chip 
stocks shot up to a two-week high while U.S. stock futures were about 1% in the red.    Delta Air Lines, American 
Airlines Group and United Airlines Holdings are among the biggest pre-market decliners after Warren Buffett said 
over the weekend Berkshire Hathaway sold out of the four top U.S. airlines, opining that the business has 'changed 
in a very major way.' The JETS airline ETF tumbled -10%.    In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 slumped, with all 
19industry sectorsin the red and Ireland's Ryanair Holdings Plc sinking as much as 11%. Earlier, MSCI's broadest 
index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2.5%, pulled down by Hong Kong where the Hang Seng returned 
from a two-session holiday with its biggest drop in six weeks as traders caught up after a long weekend. 
China and Japan were closed for their own holidays. The Chinese yuan held most of Friday's slide in offshore 
trading amid concern tensions with the U.S. would increase.  Emerging-market stocks suffered the biggest decline 
in six weeks as an increase intension between the U.S. and China dented demand for riskier assets.  U.S. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was 'a significant amount of evidence' that the novel 
coronavirus emerged from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. An editorial in China's Global Times 
said he was 'bluffing' and called on the United States to present its evidence.  'Concern on the potential for another 
flare up between the U.S. and China is dominating price action,' RBC strategist Adam Cole said in a morning note. 
Simon Black, head of investment management at wealth management firm Dolfin said investors were also adjusting 
their forecasts for the depth of the economic damage the pandemic will inflict. 'It's also the economic reality sinking 
in,' he said, adding that a rebound by global equities of over 20% from lows hit in March was not likely to be 
sustainable.  President Donald Trump also renewed criticism of China for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak is 
raising concern over the future of the two countries' trade deal, another potential risk for emerging markets already 
facing dwindling demand for exports.  "This renews concerns on the trade war and the hegemonic dispute between 
Global Stocks Tumble On Renewed US -China Tensions; US Airlines Plunge On Buffett Exit
the two countries, which we have been expecting to last for many months and to be a structural factor for EMs in 
the long run,' said Guillaume Tresca, a senior strategist at Credit Agricole SA in Paris. 'Attention is now refocusing 
on the economic impact of the Covid crisis and the weak stance of many emerging-market countries.'  Elsewhere, 
companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 are currently expected to report a 40% decline in earnings in 
the second quarter. Manufacturing activity in the euro zone collapsed last month as government-imposed 
lockdowns to stop the spread of the new coronavirus forced factories to close and consumers to stay at home, a 
survey showed on Monday.  'We've just come off a rally of hopes, not a rally on fundamentals', Black said, pointing 
to the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus pledged by governments and central banks around the world.  Recent 
economic data paints a dire picture of the global economy after weeks of lockdowns. In the United States, 
manufacturing plunged to an 11-year low last month and consumer spending collapsed. Some 30.3 million 
Americans have filed unemployment claims.  In FX, the US dollar rose against most major currencies amid fears 
that last year's U.S.-China dispute would be reignited, this time over the origins of the pandemic that has stalled 
economies around the world. The euro was down 0.37% at $1.0933 and the pound retreated 0.72% to $1.2407. EM 
currencies weakened, while sovereign bond yields were little changed. The Russian ruble, Indonesian rupiah and 
South Korean won led the currency declines as haven demand bolstered the U.S. dollar. With China's onshore 
markets closed for a holiday, the yuan weakened as much as 0.3% against the dollar in offshore trading, before 
regaining ground.  In commodities, oil prices fell again, paring last week's gains, on worries a global oil glut may 
persist even as lockdowns start to ease. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 5.5% to $18.69 a barrel while 
Brent crude futures were down 2.8% at $25.70. Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,706.78 per ounce.  Expected data 
include factory orders and durable goods orders. Ferrari, Tyson, and AIG are among companies reporting earnings

0.3% to 99.35  Top Overnight News from Bloomberg  A recovery from Europe's factory shutdowns will be 
'frustratingly slow,' IHS Markit said in its monthly report. Markit's index showed confidence dropped to a record low 
in April, and job cuts were the sharpest since 2009. The headline measure of euro-area activity fell to 33.4 — the 
lowest since the series began in 1997 — from 44.5 in March  The trade agreement President Donald Trump signed 
with China less than four months ago is falling short on a number of fronts, including Beijing's promises of large 
agriculture and energy purchases. But the Trump administration so far has been hesitant to ramp up the pressure 
or back away from the deal altogether, even as the rhetoric on both sides heats up  Congress turns its attention this 
week to negotiations over another round of economic stimulus, with battle lines drawn over more than $1 trillion in 
additional spending floated by Democrats amid objections from Republicans and demands from President Donald 
Trump  Germany needs several more weeks to decide on a cash-for- clunkers program to counter a slump in car 
sales, according to Finance Minister Olaf Scholz  German's top court will decide on Tuesday whether the nation can 
continue to participate in the ECB's Public Sector Purchase Program, under which the central bank buys bonds of 
euro zone governments  Factory output across several Asian countries slumped to record lows in April, signaling a 
deeper contraction in the world's manufacturing hub even as China begins restarting some operations  Japanese 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he has decided to extend a nationwide state of emergency until May 31 to combat 
the spread of the coronavirus, in comments aired live by national broadcaster NHK  Researchers continue to 
debate how fast a coronavirus vaccine may be available as states and nations look for a fast track to recovery from 
the pandemic's economic toll, with January or even the fall now on the timetable  Asian equity markets began the 
week mostly lower amid several holiday closures in the region and cautiousness ahead of this week's risk events, 
with sentiment also dragged by a flare up at the inter-Korean border and as US-China trade tensions simmered with 
President Trump stating that tariffs would be the ultimate punishment for China and warned to end the trade deal if 
China doesn't buy US goods. ASX 200 (+1.4%) was choppy with notable weakness in energy as crude prices 
resumed the rout brought on by oversupply concerns and with banking names initially pressured after Westpac 
reported a 62% drop in H1 net, although the big 4 bank eventually reversed its losses which helped the turnaround 
in the largest weighted financials sector and the index as a whole. KOSPI (-2.6%) gapped lower by over 2% at the 
open on geopolitical concerns after South Korea and North Korea exchanged gunfire at the demilitarized zone for 
the first time since 2014 which comes a day after North Korea Leader Kim made his first public appearance since 
Global Stocks Tumble On Renewed US -China Tensions; US Airlines Plunge On Buffett Exit
rumours circulated that he may have died or was incapacitated, although the index is off its lows as reports also 
noted there were no casualties from the incident which could have been accidental. Hang Seng (-4.2%) slumped as 
it played catch up from the extended weekend and ahead of today's GDP which could show the largest contraction 
on record with Financial Services Secretary Chan suggesting GDP data could be worse than the GFC and Asian 
Financial Crisis which saw economic contractions of 7.8% and 8.3% respectively. The lack of participants added to 
the uninspired mood for Hong Kong and the region, with markets in mainland China to reopen on Wednesday due 
to Labor Day holidays and with Japanese participants returning on Thursday after Golden Week. Finally, Indian 
markets were the worst performers with the NIFTY and SENSEX both collapsing by as much as 5% after the 
government extended the nationwide lockdown for two weeks but will permit "considerable relaxations" in certain 
districts.  Top Asian News  Mainland Chinese Buyers Disappear From Hong Kong Real Estate  Japan Moves to 
Extend State of Emergency Until May 31  Time Runs Out on Shaky Hong Kong Businesses as Court Reopens  
European equities opened with significant losses [Euro Stoxx 50 -3.3%], as the region catches up to Friday's 
developments, namely on the US-China trade front, after its Labor Day holiday. US equity futures also post losses 
of ~1%, with the contracts pressured by a potential rollback in the US-China Phase One trade deal should China 
not adhere to purchases. UK's FTSE 100 (-0.2%) index outperforms the region having had its Friday session whilst 
some downside could be cushioned by a softer Sterling. Sectors are lower across the board - with IT and Consumer 
Discretionary the laggards, albeit most of this overall downside would be on account of a chunk of Europe catching 
up to Friday's trade. In terms of individual movers, BT (-1.4%) opened softer (but nursed some losses) amid reports 
Telefonica (+3.4%) is said to be in discussions with Liberty Global to combine their UK assets, O2 and Virgin 
Media, in a joint venture to challenge BT and Sky in the UK - Telefonica states that the Cos are in a negotiating 
phase and the group is currently not able to guarantee either the terms or probability of its success. Sources added 
that Liberty Global also reportedly approached Vodafone (-1.1%) regarding a merger, but talks are not currently 
active. Meanwhile, Fincantieri (+15.8%) was halted limit up after receiving a US Navy contract valued at USD 
5.5bln. SocGen (-6.2%) shares see extra pressure as it expects to have provisions of EUR 3.5-5bln this year amid 
losses caused by the pandemic. CEO also sees CET1 ratio to drop to between 11-15%. Similarly, Thyssenkrupp (-
14.5%) plumbs the depths as the Co. anticipates a cash-squeeze despite the lift unit sale. Elsewhere, Roche 
(+0.3%) remains resilient to the losses in the region after the group was awarded emergency approval in the US for 
a COVID-19 antibody test and expects production to hit high double-digit millions by June and 100mln later in the 
year. Finally, Royal Mail (+6.2%) is buoyed by reports that Czech billionaire Kretinsky reportedly bought a 5.35% 
stake in the Co., sparking speculation he could launch a takeover bid.  Top European News  ThyssenKrupp Sinks 
as Unit Bidders Said to Seek More Investors  Liberty, Telefonica in Talks to Build $30 Billion U.K. Arm  European

in Five Weeks  In FX, the Greenback is back on a firmer footing after succumbing to somewhat more than the usual 
month end selling and remaining under pressure on Friday when US President Trump upped the ante against 
China via recriminations over the source of COVID-19 and the threat of retaliation. However, risk aversion has 
spread to the extent that the Buck has resumed a degree of safe-haven premium vs currency counterparts bar the 
Yen, with the DXY retaining a firmer grasp of the 99.000 handle within a 99.239-477 range.  JPY - As noted above, 
the Yen is resisting the broad trend of underperformance relative to the recovering Dollar, albeit in holiday-thinned 
trade due to Japan's Greenery Day amidst the longer Golden Week vacation, as Usd/Jpy meanders in a tight band 
below 107.00.  GBP/EUR/CHF/NZD/CAD/AUD - Sterling has lost more of its seasonal bid, as the sell in May trend 
looks set to continue for a second day with Cable teetering above 1.2400 and Eur/Gbp testing 
resistance/psychological offers around 0.8800 ahead of the 50 DMA (0.8825) even though the Euro is struggling to 
keep hold of the 1.0900 handle vs the Greenback in wake of weak Eurozone manufacturing PMIs, ECB SPF 
downgrades and a worse than forecast Sentix survey. Technically, Eur/Usd is currently close to a Fib retracement 
at 1.0938 and supported ahead of the big figure that also coincides with the 30 DMA. Elsewhere, the Franc remains 
well shy of recent highs near 0.9600 circa 0.9650, but on the rebound in Eur/Chf cross terms around 1.0550 
following mixed Swiss inputs from yet another big rise in bank sight deposits and better than expected, albeit still 
sub-50 manufacturing PMI. Meanwhile, the Kiwi, Aussie and Loonie are all nursing losses after conceding ground to 
their US rival with Nzd/Usd hovering just under 0.6050, Aud/Usd straddling 0.6400 and Usd/Cad pivoting 1.4100 
amidst renewed declines in oil prices. The Kiwi has not gleaned much from S&#38;P reaffirming NZ's AA rating and 
positive outlook or more moves towards lifting lockdown, awaiting Q1 jobs data, while the Aussie appears hesitant 
ahead of the RBA, retail sales and the SOMP.  SCANDI/EM - The aforementioned downturn in crude is weighing on 
the Norwegian Crown alongside the ongoing PMI manufacturing contraction, though not as pronounced as in 
Global Stocks Tumble On Renewed US -China Tensions; US Airlines Plunge On Buffett Exit
Sweden where the Krona is also unwinding more post-Riksbank gains. However, the Rand has derived some 
comfort from SA's PMI beating consensus and deflecting attention away from bleak economic projections out of the 
Treasury Director, while the Lira is trying to pare losses off another multi-month low on the back of firmer than 
anticipated Turkish CPI in contrast to a deeper sub-50 manufacturing PMI.  In commodities, WTI and Brent front-
month futures remain subdued but trade just off recent lows of USD 18.05/bbl and USD 25.50/bbl respectively. 
Desks note that the sentiment surrounding the complex is showing signs of improvement, with economies gradually 
reopening alongside a phase of lower global supply. 'A combination of demand edging higher as we move through 
the remainder of the year, while supply is expected to slip, will likely push the global oil market into deficit over the 
second half of this year, allowing it to draw down the significant stock builds from the first half of this year.', ING 
writes. That being said, markets have begun to factor in a potential escalation in US-China tensions - with President 
Trump floating an end to the trade pact should China not purchase US goods - which could weigh on sentiment as

overnight wrap  So far in this lockdown I've only been out for local walks. However, on Friday afternoon I had to 
cycle to the post office to send something special delivery. While I queued outside I saw my first-ever social 
distancing fight. A van overtook two cyclists and then screeched to a halt in front of them and the two parties 
exchanged very loud and angry words about an earlier commotion. After a minute, the van driver got out and went 
up to one of the cyclists and for all the world it looked like he was going to hit him. However, he suddenly stopped 
about 2 meters away as if there was a force field there (May the fourth be with you today by the way) and continued 
shouting and gesturing at him. It was very odd to watch.  As we move very slowly towards the end of the most 
stringent lockdowns across the world markets are starting the week on the back foot after US tech gave up some 
ground at the back end of last week after earnings and also as tensions in the US/China relationship resurfaced as 
the blame game for covid-19 steps up. Given it's a US election year this issue isn't likely to go away, especially as 
Joe Biden has suggested that Mr Trump is weak on China. However, on Thursday night and Friday it became a 
more immediate topic as the Washington Post reported that the US had held preliminary discussions to punish 
China for its role in the virus outbreak that included the possibility of the US cancelling its debt obligations with 
China. There was an immediate denial from Larry Kudlow who confirmed that the full faith and credit of US debt 
obligations is 'sacrosanct'. Nevertheless, the risk of a cold war between the two nations seems to be building.  
Hinting at a more troubled world order in the future, yesterday US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said on ABC 
TV that there was 'enormous evidence' to suggest covid-19 began in a laboratory in Wuhan. When you think how 
nervous markets got about the US/China trade war then if this theme continues you can't help thinking that the end 
game is far worse than it would be from a simple trade war. Very much one to watch.  Speaking overnight, 
President Trump also said tariffs would be 'the ultimate punishment' and promised a 'conclusive' report from the US 
government on the Chinese origins of the pandemic. He further said that the Phase 1 trade deal with China requires 
the country to purchase US goods and if they don't, the US will terminate the agreement. Futures on the S&#38;P 
500 are down -0.61% as we type while the Hang Seng (-3.83%), Kospi (-1.61%), Taiwan's Taiex (-2.20%) and 
India's Nifty (-3.31%) are all in the red. Markets in Japan and China are closed for a holiday. In FX, the Norwegian 
krone is trading down -1.17% this morning while the Japanese yen is up +0.13%. Elsewhere, WTI oil prices are 
down -3.29% this morning.  In other weekend news, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul index dropped -7.41% yesterday after 
the kingdom's finance minister said that 'painful' measures - including deep spending cuts - were needed to 
respond to the coronavirus crisis and crash in oil prices. On Friday, Moody's changed the outlook on the country's 
sovereign rating to negative while reaffirming the A1 rating. Elsewhere, Yohnap reported that North Korean troops 
fired at their South Korean counterparts in the demilitarized zone that divides the two countries for the first time in 
years.  Meanwhile, expect there to be some attention in markets today on Warren Buffett's annual shareholder 
meeting on Saturday where he confirmed that he'd sold all of his airline stocks, saying 'I don't know if two or three 
years from now if as many people will fly as many passenger miles as they did last year'.  Returning to the virus, 
with the extra fatalities of the last few days, Covid-19 has now moved from 24th to 23rd in the worst pandemics in 
Global Stocks Tumble On Renewed US -China Tensions; US Airlines Plunge On Buffett Exit
history measured in fatalities as a percentage of the global population (24 in total over 2000 years). Swine Flu in 
2009 has now been surpassed. You can see the note here from a couple of weeks ago where we discussed the list. 
To reach 22 on this list fatalities would have to reach 626,100. Massive global mitigation is expected to keep Covid-
19 at the lower end of our table. As we showed in the note a completely unmitigated global strategy could have put 
it as high as 13th on the list. We also showed what we think the global mortality rate will end up being based on 
various studies and discussed how the modern world has a very different tolerance for pandemics than at any time 
prior to the last few decades.  In terms of this week, the main symbolic highlight will be Friday's US job numbers. 
We'll also see PMIs in the early part of this week, 263 S&#38;P 500 and Stoxx 600 companies reporting, more 
central bank meetings (including the BoE Thursday), and another Euro Area finance minister's videoconference. If 
you want a potential black swan curveball event then the German Constitutional Court issues its final verdict on the 
ECB's PSPP program tomorrow. What I know about the German constitutional legal system could be put on the 
back of a postage stamp and still leave some room. Nevertheless, the usual form here is a begrudging acceptance 
of the ECB's involvement in financing member states and we all move on. However, one to keep a little attention 
on.  Ahead of payrolls Friday, DB's US economists are forecasting an unprecedented -22m fall in nonfarm payrolls, 
which would by far be the biggest monthly decline in the data going back to 1939, with the previous record being 
'only' a -1.959m decline back in September 1945 just as WWII ended. They're also forecasting a rise in the 
unemployment rate to 18.0%, which would be the highest unemployment rate for the US since the same war. With 
the jobless numbers set to reach unprecedented levels, investors will also be paying attention to the more up-to-
date weekly initial jobless claims from the US on Thursday, which will cover the week up to May 2. The previous 6 
weeks have seen a total of over 30m claims, though the last 4 weeks in a row have seen a decline from the peak, 
offering hope that the most rapid period of job losses may have passed.  The other data that will gain attention this 
week are the PMI releases from around the world. Thanks to various public holidays, the releases will be more 
scattered this week, with PMIs from various G20 countries coming out each day. See the day-by-day calendar at 
the end for the full run down (along with all the other releases) but today sees the manufacturing numbers from 
those on Labour Day holiday on Friday.  Earnings season continues apace over the coming week, with 159 
S&#38;P 500 companies reporting and a further 104 in the STOXX 600. Highlights include AIG and Tyson Foods 
today, followed by Disney, Total, BNP Paribas and Fiat Chrysler tomorrow. Wednesday then sees reports from 
Novo Nordisk, PayPal, TMobile, General Motors, Credit Agricole, UniCredit and BMW. On Thursday, we'll hear from 
Bristol Myers Squibb, Danaher, Raytheon Technologies, Linde, ArcelorMittal, AB InBev, Nintendo, Uber, IAG and 
Air France-KLM. Lastly on Friday, Wirecard, Siemens and Nomura will be announcing.  Reviewing last week now 
and in it we waved goodbye to April - the best month for the S&#38;P 500 (+12.68%) since January 1987. The -
2.81% fall on Friday though meant that the index closed the week down -0.21%, the smallest weekly in either 
direction since the first week of the year. There was a pullback in technology stocks as earnings of large-cap US 
companies, most notably Apple and Amazon, disappointed late in the week. Consequently the NASDAQ fell -0.34% 
on the week (-3.20% Friday). On the other hand, European equities rose on a shortened week, with many countries 
closed for Labour Day on Friday. The Stoxx 600 gained +2.37% over the five days but they'll likely be some catch 
down today. Equity performance was fairly correlated on the week for those indices that were off on Friday, with the 
DAX up +5.08% (-2.22% Thursday), the Italian FTSE MIB gaining +4.93% (-2.09% Thursday), and the CAC rallying 
+4.07% (-2.12% Thursday). The FTSE, which was open on Friday, was up just +0.19% over the full week, after the 
-2.34% decline on Friday not helped by Shell (-14.24% on the week) cutting its dividend for the first time since 
1945. Asian equity indices also saw shortened weeks outside of the Nikkei, which declined by -2.84% Friday to 
finish the week up +1.86%. The CSI 300 gained +3.04% on a 4 day week, while the Kospi rose +3.10% on a 3 day 
week. In other risk markets, oil rebounded after 3 weeks of losses. WTI futures rose +16.77% last week (+4.99% 
Friday) to $19.78/barrel as demand may be turning a corner at the same time that OPEC+ and non-members both 
enact production cuts. Brent crude rose +23.32% on the week (+4.63% Friday), just the second weekly gain in the 
last ten weeks.  55% of S&#38;P 500 companies have now reported Q1 earnings. In aggregate earnings are 
missing by -2.5% (vs. beating by 3.4% in an average quarter) and have fallen 16.6% year-over-year. Blended EPS 
growth for the index looks set to contract by -13%, which would be the worst quarter since 2009. However this is 
driven by a large downside skew, with median company growth on track to be only modestly negative at -0.9%. 
Much like GDP earlier last week, these numbers are likely to be worse in Q2 because most of the shutdowns were 
enacted at the end of March.  With the pullback in US equities, the VIX rose +1.3pts to 37.19 last week (+3.0pts 
Friday). This was the first weekly rise since the SPX lows in the third week of March. Even as equity volatility 
increased slightly, credit spreads tightened slightly on the week - albeit complicated by the index rebalancing at the 
Global Stocks Tumble On Renewed US -China Tensions; US Airlines Plunge On Buffett Exit
end of the month. US HY cash spreads were -33bps tighter on the week (+7bps Friday), while IG was -18bps 
tighter on the week (+1bp Friday). In Europe, HY cash spreads were -8bps tighter over the shortened week, while 
IG was -13bps tighter.  Much like equities, core sovereign bond yields in the US and Europe diverged slightly last 
week. US 10yr Treasury yields were up +1.1bps (-2.8bps Friday) to finish at 0.612%, 7.1bps from the March all-time 
lows. Meanwhile, 10yr Bund yields fell -11.3bps to -0.59%, the lowest since March 13. Gilt yields fell -4.3 bps over 
the 5 days (+1.8 bps Friday) to 0.248%, just 9bps from the all-time lows in early March. Euro debt diverged in a 
similar manner. Spanish and French sovereign debt were -11.6 and -2.0 bps tighter, respectively, to Bunds, while 
Italian debt traded +3.7bps wider after the decision by Fitch to downgrade the country's credit rating to BBB- and an 
ECB meeting that disappointed on OMT guidance.  On the economic data front last Friday, UK mortgage approvals 
in March fell to their lowest level in seven years, while the final manufacturing PMI came in at 32.6, 0.3 below the 
flash reading. In the US, Markit Manufacturing PMIs were at 36.1 (36.7 expected), 0.8 below the flash reading of 
36.9. At the same time the ISM Manufacturing PMI came in stronger than expected at 41.5 (36.0 expected), down 
from 49.1 last month. The ISM measures continue to see significant upside contribution from supplier delivery 
delays, but this is driven by supply chain disruption rather than stronger fundamentals. So difficult to read too much 
into this stronger reading. [ 1]: http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/ih9Y1KD60PY/global-stocks-

May 04, 2020( New Europe: https://www.neweurope.eu/ Delivered by Newstex)  Irish budget carrier Ryanair said on 
Friday it planned to cut 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15% of staff, 'as a direct result of the unprecedented 
COVID-19 crisis'. The move comes after the airline predicted it would take until summer 2022 at the earliest before 
passenger demand recovers. 'The Ryanair Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and 
job loss program, which will commence from July 2020. These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all 
Ryanair Airlines, and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave, and pay 
cuts of up to 20 percent, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers', it said in 
a statement. 
'Today we are announcing cuts of just over 15 percent, of which we have to lose regrettably about 3,000 mainly 
pilots and cabin crew over the next three to four months', CEO Michael O'Leary said, and added: 'We expect to be 
allowed by the European governments to go back in July or from July onwards. What we are facing now is a historic 
decline in air traffic in Europe for the next 12-18 months'. Last month, amid the crisis, Ryanair offered its planes to 
all EU governments[1], for rescue flights, as well as for the movement of vital medicines, personal protective 
equipment and emergency food supplies. It stressed that the planes used for the purpose will be disinfected on a 
daily basis. [ 1]: https://www.neweurope.eu/article/ryanair-expected-to-halt-all-flights-in-april-and-may/

Heathrow third runway project faces fresh delays
Heathrow third runway project faces fresh delays

Heathrow's plans for a third runway face at least another two-year delay, its management has admitted, amid calls 
for the £14bn project to be shelved.
John Holland-Kaye, chief executive, said that the airport would have to take a decision at a later date on whether it 
went ahead with the runway.
If it did go ahead, the runway would not be completed until the beginning of the 2030s because of the coronavirus 
crisis and an appeal in court.
"If we are successful in protecting and building the UK economy, we will need that third runway. Whether it's in 10 
or 15 years' time, I don't know," he said yesterday.
"We're privately funding it ourselves, so we will have to make a rational decision about making that investment. But 
I think the UK will need it."
Heathrow expected passenger numbers to have fallen 97 per cent in April. It warned that the government needed to 
signal within the next week how flying could restart, or there would be mass redundancies across the industry.
This week British Airways and Ryanair announced cuts to their workforce of almost 30 per cent and 15 per cent 
respectively.
Heathrow third runway project faces fresh delays
"We're at a critical point, a knife edge, where those decisions are going to be made in the next month or two. If the 
government wants to save jobs, it needs to be out there committing to working on this common international 
standard [for safe air travel to encourage passengers to fly]," said Mr Holland-Kaye. These internationally agreed 
standards would include temperature checks at all airports and mandatory facemask-wearing, but Mr Holland-Kaye 
warned that social distancing would not work at airports.
One former Tory cabinet minister said the aviation crisis gave Boris Johnson the "perfect excuse" to finally scupper 
the runway - a scheme the prime minister had opposed for many years. He said it was unclear whether aviation 
demand would ever return to levels seen before Covid-19.
One minister said: "I don't see any prospect whatsoever of it happening."
Separately, Andrew Adonis, a former Labour transport secretary, predicted that travellers would turn in growing 
numbers from flying to "greener" railway services.
"I don't think the third runway at Heathrow is now going to be built in the 2020s, maybe never," said Lord Adonis, 
who has previously been a backer of the project.

Axe swings over up to 15% of Ryanair jobs; Airlines ; Costs-focused O'Leary brands bailouts for legacy carriers

Ryanair is preparing to cut up to 15 per cent of its 19,000-strong workforce as it becomes the latest airline to warn 
that the industry faces a slow recovery.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier said it expected that it would take at least two years for a return to last year's levels 
of passenger demand and pricing.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said his outlook on the recovery had changed over the past week in light of the 
(EURO)9bn bailout Air France-KLM had won from the French and Dutch governments, and the state aid Lufthansa 
was expected to receive.
He said: "The whole competitive market has now been completely turned on its head.
"The weakest airlines going into the crisis - Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, Alitalia - who were going to in normal 
circumstances have to restructure and retrench, are now going to be enormously enriched with this state aid 
doping.
"I think what we are facing now is that ... they'll be able to make life very difficult for the well-run airlines like 
ourselves, BA and easyJet."
Axe swings over up to 15% of Ryanair jobs; Airlines ; Costs-focused O'Leary brands bailouts for legacy carriers 
'state aid doping'
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had to respond by downsizing for the next 12 months.
"Unless we have materially lower costs for the next 12-24 months, we won't be able to operate successfully in a 
market where air fares are going to be materially lower."
Ryanair intends to axe as many as 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, introduce pay cuts of up to 20 per cent, and 
close a number of aircraft bases around Europe until air travel recovers. Mr O'Leary will extend his 50 per cent pay 
cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021. He could not rule out further reductions in the workforce.
On Tuesday, British Airways revealed plans to axe almost 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong workforce. SAS, the 
Scandinavian airline, said it would permanently cut half - 5,000 - of its staff. Ryanair yesterday said it expected to 
carry no more than 50 per cent of its original traffic target of 44.6m passengers between July and September.
For the full year ending March 2021, it is forecasting fewer than 100m passengers - 35 per cent below its original 
target of 154m. In April, May and June, it expects to carry 150,000 - 99.5 per cent short of its previous target of 
42.4m passengers.
The update comes just a week after Mr O'Leary gave a bullish outlook for a recovery in air travel, outlining plans for 
the airline to resume 80 per cent of flights by September, provided flying in Europe could restart from July.
Mr O'Leary confirmed that Ryanair had filed a legal complaint to the European Commission over its state aid 
concerns, and said it would launch legal action by the end of the month.

Rolls-Royce is preparing to cut up to 8,000 jobs, the biggest single reduction in more than 30 years, after aircraft 
makers Airbus and Boeing slashed production to cope with plunging demand. Executives of the UK aero-engine 
maker have begun work on a restructuring plan that would shrink the 52,000-strong workforce by up to 15 per cent, 
according to several people inside the company.
It follows Ryanair's announcement it is preparing to cut 3,000 jobs, or 15 per cent of its 19,000 workforce, yesterday 
and IAG's plan to cut 12,000 staff at British Airways, or almost 30 per cent of the 42,000 employed, earlier in the 
week.
An announcement on a final figure is not expected before the end of May, when Rolls-Royce has said it will update 
employees.
Discussions had begun with unions, the sources said, and measures could still be found to mitigate the final 
number. However, the scale was still likely to be larger than after 9/11, when the group cut 5,000 jobs, two people 
said.
News of the planned job losses, which are expected to hit the UK civil business hardest, will be a blow to the 
government, which had hoped to preserve employment by offering wage support programmes.
Up to 15% of Rolls-Royce jobs face axe in planned shake-up ? Biggest single reduction in three decades ? UK 
workforce set to bear brunt
These only last until June, and the aerospace industry is braced for a sharp and protracted fall in demand after 
more than a decade of booming orders.
Government restrictions on travel in the battle against the pandemic have brought aviation to a virtual standstill, and 
Airbus and Boeing have both said it will take several years to recover to 2019 levels. The two biggest aircraft 
makers in recent weeks have cut production 35 per cent and 50 per cent respectively.
Rolls-Royce, focused on the long haul segment of aviation that is expected to take the longest to recover, had also 
had to respond to the collapse in demand, said two people with knowledge of the situation.
Stephen Daintith, finance director, told employees this week that the group expected its civil aerospace business to 
be a third smaller as a result of the crisis and that job losses could be expected.
Last month Rolls-Royce suspended its dividend for the first time in more than 30 years, cut back on capital 
expenditure, and ditched its target to achieve £1bn in free cash flow by the end of this year. The group is 
considering cutting research and development investment and slowing its next-generation engine programme, 
UltraFan.
"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented," the company said. "We have taken swift action to 
increase our liquidity, dramatically reduce our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these 
exceptionally challenging times. But we will need to take further action."
The vast majority of the job cuts are expected to hit the civil aerospace business, which employs 23,000 people and 
accounts for roughly half the group's 2019 revenue of £15.4bn.
The UK's 16,000 civil workforce is expected to bear the brunt of the cuts and in particular Derby, historic home of 
the 116-year-old company. About a quarter of the UK civil workforce has already been furloughed. Job losses are 
expected in the civil operations in Singapore and Germany, as well as central and support functions.
It will be the latest in a series of restructurings and job loss programmes to have hit Rolls-Royce's workforce since a 
string of profit warnings starting in 2013. This year was supposed to have drawn to a close a two-year plan to cut 
4,600 support jobs.
In the past, job cuts have focused on managers, support staff and engineering staff. This time, however, the cuts 
will affect the factory floor. "We have got to the point where this has to be done for the viability of the company," 
said one person close to the subject.

Rolls-Royce is preparing to cut up to 8,000 jobs, the biggest single reduction in more than 30 years, after aircraft 
makers Airbus and Boeing slashed production to cope with plunging demand. Executives of the UK aero-engine 
maker have begun work on a restructuring plan that would shrink the 52,000-strong workforce by up to 15 per cent, 
according to several people inside the company.
It follows Ryanair's announcement it is preparing to cut 3,000 jobs, or 15 per cent of its 19,000 workforce, yesterday 
and IAG's plan to cut 12,000 staff at British Airways, or almost 30 per cent of the 42,000 employed, earlier in the 
week.
An announcement on a final figure is not expected before the end of May, when Rolls-Royce has said it will update 
employees.
Discussions had begun with unions, the sources said, and measures could still be found to mitigate the final 
number. However, the scale was still likely to be larger than after 9/11, when the group cut 5,000 jobs, two people 
said.
News of the planned job losses, which are expected to hit the UK civil business hardest, will be a blow to the 
government, which had hoped to preserve employment by offering wage support programmes.
Up to 15% of Rolls-Royce jobs face axe in planned shake-up; ? Biggest single reduction in three decades ? UK 
workforce set to bear brunt
These only last until June, and the aerospace industry is braced for a sharp and protracted fall in demand after 
more than a decade of booming orders.
Government restrictions on travel in the battle against the pandemic have brought aviation to a virtual standstill, and 
Airbus and Boeing have both said it will take several years to recover to 2019 levels. The two biggest aircraft 
makers in recent weeks have cut production 35 per cent and 50 per cent respectively.
Rolls-Royce, focused on the long haul segment of aviation that is expected to take the longest to recover, had also 
had to respond to the collapse in demand, said two people with knowledge of the situation.
Stephen Daintith, finance director, told employees this week that the group expected its civil aerospace business to 
be a third smaller as a result of the crisis and that job losses could be expected.
Last month Rolls-Royce suspended its dividend for the first time in more than 30 years, cut back on capital 
expenditure, and ditched its target to achieve £1bn in free cash flow by the end of this year. The group is 
considering cutting research and development investment and slowing its next-generation engine programme, 
UltraFan.
"The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented," the company said. "We have taken swift action to 
increase our liquidity, dramatically reduce our spending in 2020, and strengthen our resilience in these 
exceptionally challenging times. But we will need to take further action."
The vast majority of the job cuts are expected to hit the civil aerospace business, which employs 23,000 people and 
accounts for roughly half the group's 2019 revenue of £15.4bn.
The UK's 16,000 civil workforce is expected to bear the brunt of the cuts and in particular Derby, historic home of 
the 116-year-old company. About a quarter of the UK civil workforce has already been furloughed. Job losses are 
expected in the civil operations in Singapore and Germany, as well as central and support functions.
It will be the latest in a series of restructurings and job loss programmes to have hit Rolls-Royce's workforce since a 
string of profit warnings starting in 2013. This year was supposed to have drawn to a close a two-year plan to cut 
4,600 support jobs.
In the past, job cuts have focused on managers, support staff and engineering staff. This time, however, the cuts 
will affect the factory floor. "We have got to the point where this has to be done for the viability of the company," 
said one person close to the subject.

R emember the V-shaped recovery? Not long ago, it was the consensus: a short sharp shock from the pandemic 
followed by a rebound in the third quarter.
The trillions of government support was bridge financing, to keep the lights on until the inevitable joyous explosion 
of pent-up demand. V for victory!
But it became clear this week during a series of corporate announcements that it was V for vain hopes.
"If we had to make a bet today, we would say it's not going to be a V-shaped recovery and it's probably not going to 
be U or L, it's going to be some other kind of shape," said Carlos Rodriguez, amateur geometrist and head of 
payroll processor ADP. Perhaps a "Nike swoosh", he suggested.
In a V-shaped world, people emerge blinking from lockdowns and jet off to the beaches. But Norwegian Air Shuttle 
warned this week that it expected to stay in "hibernation" for the next 12 months and would only resume normal 
operations in 2022. British Airways announced 12,000 redundancies and said it would "take several years" to return 
to last year's passenger levels. Having maintained his optimism as recently as last week, Michael O'Leary of 
Ryanair yesterday forecast that last year's level of demand would not return until the summer of 2022.
As Southwest Airlines chief Gary Kelly put it: "If it's a V-shape recovery, well, we'll all high-five each other and we'll 
go buy some more aeroplanes. But I don't think that's the most likely outcome right now."
Farewell to the V-shaped revival as mood sours
This souring of the mood has been accompanied, bizarrely, by a miniboom in stocks. After surging prices in April - 
the biggest rise on the S&P 500 since 1987 - we are well along the uphill slope of the V. Investors are determined to 
follow the outliers and the miracle merchants.
Gilead Sciences, a California-based biotech company, has become the bellwether for the market. Promising trial 
data on using Gilead's remdesivir antiviral to treat Covid-19 sends the market higher; negative data are shrugged 
off. Even if the treatment works, it is no wonder drug; in the best case, it could shorten hospital stays. Nonetheless, 
Gilead shares are up more than a quarter this year.
The rocket boosters come from the tech sector. Of course there is Zoom, the ubiquitous video calling service, but 
the market cap heavyweights such as Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft are lifting the S&P 500. As we all stay at home 
on video calls and consume social media ad content on our iPhones, that sounds reasonable. But a few months 
from now, who will be employing these home workers, paying for their smartphones and advertising to them? Not 
just airlines, but many other industries are stricken. Restaurants are warning that they cannot survive lockdowns for 
much longer. But it is also hard to imagine packed dining rooms when they do reopen.
McDonald's acknowledged as much this week, with boss Christopher Kempczinski noting that "we're not seeing a 
V-shaped recovery in China". But most McDonald's in the country do not have a drive-through facility. In the US, 95 
per cent do, dodging the problems of social distancing.
In Europe, where McDonald's is slowly reopening, Big Mac maniacs endured a three-hour wait in France and a two-
mile queue in Austria.
A lot rests on such nuggets of optimism.

Rolls-Royce looks at 8,000 job cuts as skies turn quiet Rolls-Royce is preparing its biggest round of job cuts in more 
than three decades after global restrictions on travel have brought aviation to a virtual standstill. Executives at the 
aero-engine manufacturer are working on plans that would result in up to 8,000 job losses. Ryanair and British 
Airways both announced thousands of job cuts this week after demand for flights collapsed.

The outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are 
developments Friday related to the global economy, the work place and the spread of the virus.
________________________
AIRLINES: The aviation industry is teetering on the edge as travel demand crawls to a near standstill but costs 
remain.
- Boeing says that because it raised $25 billion from a sale of bonds it doesn't plan to ask the federal government 
for a loan. The company announced this week it will cut 10% of its 161,000-person work force through attrition, 
early-out offers and layoffs.
- The Transportation Security Administration screened 154,695 people at airports on Thursday, its busiest day since 
March 29. That was still down 94% from the same Thursday a year ago, however. Airline executives say they are 
seeing a very slight increase in bookings, mostly for flights at least 90 days from now.
- Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines said Friday they will soon require that passengers cover their faces during 
flights. With those announcements, all of the six largest U.S. airlines will begin recovering face masks or coverings, 
some starting on Monday. JetBlue Airways was the first to announce such a policy on Monday. Delta, American and 
United followed suit on Thursday.
- The incoming CEO of United Airlines, Scott Kirby, said that if air travel remains very low on Oct. 1, the company 
will have to lay off workers and further cut the hours of other employees. United got $5 billion in federal aid to help 
cover payroll costs through September. Analysts believe layoffs are likely in October unless the airlines get more 
help from the government. Kirby is United's president and will succeed the retiring Oscar Munoz as CEO later this 
month.
- Ryanair plans to cut as many as 3,000 jobs and close bases in Europe amid the collapse of travel due to the 
pandemic. It will operate less than 1% of its flights from April to June.
Boeing says it won't seek government aid; an odd May Day
- Domestic airlines in Thailand are resuming some regular flights, as half of the country's provincial airports 
reopened. Department of Airports Director-General Tawee Kaysisam-ang told reporters that 14 of the 28 airports 
his agency oversees reopened Friday.
MAY DAY: Protests and rallies typically mark the international Labor Day, but this year's events look markedly 
different due to COVID-19.
- Some Italian entrepreneurs looked to draw attention to their plight on the nation's May Day holiday. Some cafes 
put dressed mannequins in poses as if they were buying products or sipping coffee at counters in their empty 
businesses.
- The capital in tech-savvy Finland replaced parades and speeches with virtual reality. Helsinki had been 
encouraging residents to mark the eve before May Day - one of the Nordic country's main public festivities 
especially among youth - through attending a virtual concert by popular local rap duo JVG.
- A prominent workers' union in Croatia held an online Labor Day protest as the lockdown against the new 
coronavirus prevented traditional gatherings and demonstrations.
TECHNOLOGY: With an overabundance of COVID-19 patients, the healthcare section is increasingly turning to 
technology to aid in the fight against the outbreak.
- Robot staff have debuted at a Tokyo hotel for mildly-sick coronavirus patients under a new plan to free up beds at 
hospitals overburdened with more severe cases.
Pepper, a semi-humanoid talking robot, greets new entrants at the lobby and reminds patients to check their daily 
temperature and encourages them to rest. "Whiz," a cleaner robot, will operate in areas where patients come to 
pick up meals and other daily necessities.
CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS & BANKS: Countries are moving toward easing strict stay-at-home orders, but the 
economic fallout from the virus is becoming more clear.
- Spain's government expects that the eurozone's fourth largest economy will shrink by 9.2% this year and that 
unemployment will reach 19% of the working-age population.
- Malaysia will allow most economic sectors and business activities to reopen Monday, days before a two-month 
lockdown is due to end after infections fell sharply in recent weeks.
- Malta's Prime Minister Robert Abela says non-essential shops will be allowed to re-open on Monday. Health 
services, not related to coronavirus infections and which had been suspended, will also resume.
MARKETS:
- Stocks retreated on Wall Street Friday after Amazon and other big companies laid out how the coronavirus 
pandemic is hitting their bottom lines.

Ryanair Warns Up to 3,000 Jobs at Risk as Passenger Demand, Fare-Pricing Recovery to Take 'At Least' Two

Ryanair Warns Up to 3,000 Jobs at Risk as Passenger Demand, Fare-Pricing 
Recovery to Take 'At Least' Two Years

 Ryanair (RYAAY, RAY.L), Europe's biggest budget airline, warned Friday that a recovery in passenger demand 
and pricing to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels wasn't expected before the summer of 2022 "at the earliest," setting 
the stage for potential job and pay cuts for up to 3,000 employees.
The Dublin, Ireland-based carrier said trade unions will be notified "shortly" about its restructuring and job loss 
program scheduled to kick off in July, according to a statement. It does not expect to carry more than 50% of its 
original traffic target of 44.6 million in the fiscal second quarter -- July to September -- when "some" return to flight 
services is foreseen. For the full year, Ryanair sees itself lagging its passenger-carrying target of 154 million by 
more than 35%.
Ryanair is of the view that it will take some time for passenger volumes to return as consumer confidence will be 
hurt by public health restrictions such as temperature checks at airports and face coverings.
The group expects to report a loss of more than 100 million euros ($109 million) in its fiscal first-quarter ending in 
June, and further losses in the second quarter which encapsulates its peak summer season. Ryanair refrained from 
offering fiscal 2021 guidance given the uncertainty over the duration of the coronavirus crisis and a slower return to 
"normal" flight services,
"Ryanair expects its return to scheduled services will be rendered more difficult by competing with flag carrier 
airlines, who will be financing below-cost selling with the benefit of over 30 billion euros in unlawful State Aid, in 
breach of both European Union State Aid and competition rules," the airline said.
The firm, whose Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary has agreed to extend his own 50% pay cut to the rest of 
the financial year,  said layoffs will mainly affect pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave, and pay cuts of up to 20%, 
as well as the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers.
Ryanair Warns Up to 3,000 Jobs at Risk as Passenger Demand, Fare-Pricing Recovery to Take 'At Least' Two 
Years
Ryanair, which has almost 4 billion euros in cash, said that "active negotiations" were underway with Boeing (BA) 
as well as its unit Laudamotion's A320 lessors to take fewer aircraft deliveries than planned over the next 24 
months.
Meanwhile, International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, said its subsidiaries Iberia and Vueling 
Airlines have signed loan agreements for 750 million euros and 260 million euros, respectively. The financing 
program has a five-year term but is repayable at any time on notice from the two carriers.
Additionally, Reuters reported early Friday that a deadline passed overnight for bondholders of Norwegian Air, the 
third-biggest budget airline in Europe, to vote on a debt-to-equity rescue package.

 Ryanair plans to cut 3,000 jobs and talk to Boeing about delaying plane deliveries as it does not expect European 
air traffic to recover fully from the coronavirus crisis until 2022, the Irish airline said on Friday,
Two weeks ago, Europe's biggest budget airline said it could make bumper profits in 2021 and had no plans to 
defer jet orders.
But in an unscheduled update, Ryanair pushed back the start of a return to normal scheduling to July from June 
and said it would only fly 50% of planned capacity in the three months to the end of September, usually its busiest 
season.
The airline said it was now reviewing growth plans and plane orders and was in talks with Boeing and aircraft 
lessors to cut the number of deliveries over the next 24 months.
"Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will take at least two years, to 
until summer 2022 at the earliest," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in the update for investors.
He said the airline would begin consultations on the closure of bases and up to 3,000 job cuts, mainly pilots and 
cabin crew.
Ryanair said it expected a loss of 100 million euros ($110 million) in the three months to the end of June, which 
O'Leary said was the first time the airline has ever suffered a loss in that quarter.
O'Leary also said he planned to challenge in European Courts what he described as more than 30 billion euros in 
state aid to a dozen rivals.

aid doping to allow them to sustain below-cost selling for months after this COVID-19 crisis has passed." (Reuters)

Low-cost Irish carrier Ryanair warned on Friday that it could cut up to 3,000 jobs, as global efforts to curb the novel 
coronavirus pandemic continue to have a severe impact on airlines.
Ryanair said it plans talks with trade unions on a "restructuring and job loss programme" to be launched in July.
It said the cost-cutting programme "may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid 
leave, and pay cuts of up to 20 per cent, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic 
recovers."
Ryanair's head office staff and support teams will also be subject to job cuts and pay cuts, the airline said.
Ryanair expects to operate just 1 per cent of its flight programme from April to June, and a maximum of 50 per cent 
of flights in its July to September financial quarter.
"As a direct result of the unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, the grounding of all flights from mid-March until at least 
July, and the distorted state aid landscape in Europe, Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and 
pricing will take at least two years," it said.
Ryanair group chief executive Michael O'Leary has agreed to a 50-per-cent salary reduction until March, it added.
The owner of British Airways announced plans on Tuesday for up to 12,000 redundancies.
BA has written to staff warning that it might not resume operations at Britain's second-busiest airport, Gatwick, the 
Financial Times reported on Thursday.

Twelve European Union (EU) member states - Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czechia, France, Greece, Ireland, Latvia, 
Malta, Poland, Portugal, and the Netherlands - have sent a letter to the European Commission (EC) asking it to 
suspend regulation EC (No) 261/2004 which requires airlines to offer a full refund for cancelling a flight. The nations 
believe that the law "places airlines in a difficult situation where they are facing a serious cash flow challenge." It 
suggests that when the regulation was devised, "the current global crisis and its impact on air travel could not have 
been foreseen." Instead of imposing the letter of the law, the 12 nations state that the objective should be "to 
preserve the structure of the European air traffic market beyond the current crisis while considering the interests 
and necessary protection of passengers." Criticism has been levelled at some airlines that have offered passengers 
vouchers to use on a future flight, without mentioning the possibility of getting a refund, as per the law. Air France-
KLM is among the companies not offering refunds to passengers and they, along with Ryanair (FR, Dublin Int'l), 
have told passengers they must wait several months for their refund request, according to Forbes.

"Today we are announcing cuts of just over 15 percent, of which we have to lose regrettably about 3,000 mainly 
pilots and cabin crew over the next three to four months," O'Leary told Bloomberg TV."That's because this year we 
are now facing carrying less than a 100 million passengers against an original budget of 154 million passengers... 
The situation is grim.""We expect to be allowed by the European governments to go back in July or from July 
onwards. 
What we are facing now is a historic decline in air traffic in Europe for the next 12-18 months."

POINTSRyanairwill slash the pay of existing staff by up to 20%Ryanair will cut 3,000 jobs, mostly pilots, cabin 
crewRyanair expects to report a net loss of more than $110 millionin the first quarter Irish budget airline Ryanair[1] 
said it will cut 3,000 jobs, mostly pilots and cabin crew, out of its 17,000-strong workforce, due to the halt in air 
travel caused by the coronavirus crisis. The Dublin-based carrier also said it will slash the pay of existing staff by up 
to 20% and close several of its aircraft bases across Europe until air travel demand recovers.Ryanair chief 
executive Michael O'Leary, whose salary was already cut by 50% for April and May, has agreed to extend this 
reduction rate through March 2021.Ryanair predicted that passenger demand and normal pricing will likely not 
recover for another two years at least.'The Ryanair airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its 
restructuring and job loss program, which will commence from July 2020,' the company said. 'These plans will be 
subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair airlines.'O'Leary did not rule out the possibility of future job cuts.'If a 
[coronavirus] vaccine isn't found then clearly [2]we may have to announce more cuts and deeper cuts into the 
future,' he told BBC.Fórsa, the Irish trade union which represents Ryanair cabin crew and pilots, said it will be seek 
an early engagement with the airline, but will make no public comments until management provides a detailed plan 
to the union. 
Ryanair also said it expects to report a net loss of more than €100 million ($110 million) in the first quarter, with 
additional losses in the second quarter.The carrier said it will ground more than 99% of its flights through 
July.Ryanair has also entered into discussions with Boeing (BA[3]) and Airbus to cut aircraft orders over the next 
two years to 'more accurately reflect a slower and more distorted EU air travel market in a post-Covid-19 
world.'O'Leary has also criticized the huge government bailouts[4] received by some European airlines, including 
Air France-KLM and Lufthansa.'[The] whole competitive market has now been completely turned on its head,' he 
said. 'The weakest airlines going into the crisis -- Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, Alitalia -- who were going to, in 
normal circumstances, have to restructure and retrench are now going to be enormously enriched with this state aid 
doping. I think what we are facing now is that . . . they ' ll be able to make life very difficult for the well-run airlines 
like ourselves, [British Airways] and EasyJet. 'In response, O'Leary said Ryanair will have to downsize over the next 
12 months in order to compete.'Unless we have materially lower costs for the next 12-24 months, we won't be able 
to operate successfully in a market where air fares are going to be materially lower,' he warned.O'Leary confirmed 
that Ryanair filed a legal complaint to the European Commission over its fears regarding airlines receiving massive 
state aid. Ryanair will also likely challenge these government bailouts in European courts.'Air France and Lufthansa 
Ryanair To Cut 3,000 Jobs; CEO O'Leary Slams European Carriers Taking Huge Bailouts
are subsidy junkies hoovering up state aid. We support transparent non-discriminatory schemes like payroll 
support,' O'Leary told BBC. '[But] why does Lufthansa need another [$13.2 billion] on top of that? It means that for 
the next three to five years they can engage in below-cost selling. We face unfair competition against legacy airlines 
in Europe getting unfair state aid.'Stephen Furlong, transport analyst with Davy Stockbrokers[5] of Dublin, said 
coronavirus is the worst crisis airlines have ever faced."I would say that some airlines will disappear, some even 
strong airlines will be smaller and then others will be growing slower than they would have, but will emerge 
ultimately 
stronger, 
and 
Ryanair 
will 
be 
one 
of 
them," 
Furlong 
said.

       Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) said the Group expects to report a net loss of over 100 million euros in 
first quarter, with further losses in second quarter due to the substantial decline in traffic arising from Covid-19 fleet 
groundings. Ryanair expects to operate less than 1% of its scheduled flying program in Apr, May &June;. First 
quarter traffic of less than 150,000 passengers will be 99.5% behind the budget. Ryanair expects to carry no more 
than 50% of its original traffic target of 44.6 million in second quarter. For the full year ending March 2021, Ryanair 
now expects to carry less than 100 million passengers, more than 35% below its original target.
 The company now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing will take at least 2 years. The Ryanair 
Airlines plans a restructuring and job loss program to commence from July 2020, which may result in the loss of up 
to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave, and pay cuts of up to 20%, and the closure of a number of 
aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers. The company is in active negotiations with both Boeing, and 
Laudamotion's A320 lessors to cut the number of planned aircraft deliveries over the next 24 months. 
 Group CEO Michael O'Leary, whose pay was reduced by 50% for April and May, has now agreed to extend his 
pay cut for the remainder of the fiscal year.

       The U.K. market ended sharply lower on Friday, as worries about U.S.-China trade war resurfaced after U.S. 
President Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on goods imported from China.
 Other markets in Europe were closed for Labour Day.
 Disappointing data on UK housing sector and a report showing a sharp drop in consumer credit and mortgage 
approvals in March added to the woes.
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared that the U.K. was officially past the peak of coronavirus infections - but 
asked people to continue to comply with lockdown restrictions.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 ended down 138.15 points, or 2.34%, at 5,763.06. 
 Carnival shed about 7.6%. Royal Dutch Shell lost nearly 7%. Glencore, Prudential, Meggitt, St. James Place, TUI, 
EasyJet, Rolls-Royce Holdings and WPP lost 5 to 6.5%.
 Anglo American, Hikma Pharmaceutical, British American Tobacco, Evraz, BP, Antofagasta, BHP Group, Intertek 
and Lloyds Banking Group lost 3 to 4.7%.
 IAG lost about 3% after the group said its Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling have secured €1 billion ($1.1 billion) 
in government-backed loans to see it through the worst of the corona-crisis. Spanish flag-carrier Iberia will receive 
€750 million ($825 million), and its low-cost compatriot Vueling €260 million ($286 million), IAG said in a statement 
released Friday.
 Ryanair Holdings shares tumbled nearly 9% after the group said it expects to report a net loss of over 100 million 
euros in the first quarter, with further losses expected in the second quarter due to the substantial decline in traffic 
arising from Covid-19 fleet groundings.
U.K. Market Settles Sharply Lower On Economic Worries
 In economic releases, the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI was revised lower to 32.6 in April 2020 from a 
preliminary estimate of 32.9. The reading marks the steepest month of contraction in the sector in about 28 years. 
 U.K. house prices increased at the fastest pace since 2017 before the coronavirus pandemic struck the economy, 
data published by the Nationwide Building Society showed.
 House prices increased 3.7% on a yearly basis in April, faster than the 3% rise in March. The annual growth was 
forecast to ease to 2.5%.
 Consumer credit in the United Kingdom dropped by GBP 3.8 billion in March 2020, following a GBP 0.9 billion 
increase in the previous month and compared to market expectations of a GBP 0.7 billion rise. That was the largest 
decline in consumer credit since the series began in 1993.
 The number of mortgages approved for house purchase in the United Kingdom decreased to 56,161 in March 
2020, the lowest since March 2013, from an upwardly revised 73,674 in the previous month.

Ryanair is reviewing its orders with Boeing and leasing contracts with subsidiary Laudamotion as it plans for a 
prolonged period of depressed demand.
In a trading update, the airline outlined plans to cut aircraft deliveries over the next 24 months to reduce capital 
expenditure and "more accurately" reflect a slower EU air travel market after Covid-19.
The airline was due to take delivery of its first Boeing 737 Max aircraft in 2019, but the grounding of the type pushed 
back that plan. Ryanair then was due to take 30 Max aircraft during the summer, but this had been postponed to the 
winter.
Laudamotion's fleet is entirely leased. The Austrian carrier has 26 Airbus A320s. Four are owned by GECAS; 
another four by Aercap; three by Castlelake, Deucalion Aviation and Standard Chartered Bank, respectively; 
Horizon Aviation has two; and others are owned by a variety of other lessors, Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker 
shows.
The airline is planning to make up to 3,000 pilots and cabin crew redundant, close bases and impose pay cuts. 
Executives, including chief executive officer Michael O'Leary, have taken pay cuts.
The low-cost carrier expects to report a net loss of more than (EURO)100 million ($108 million) in the first quarter, 
with further losses in the second quarter due to a "substantial" decline in traffic. It does not expect traffic to return to 
pre-Covid-19 levels until 2022 at the earliest.
For the full year ending March 2021, Ryanair now expects to carry fewer than 100 million passengers, more than 
35% below its original 154 million target.
Ryanair plans to challenge in the European court what it described as state aid "doping" provided to its competitors 
to support them through the Covid-19 crisis.
The airline warned that the level playing field in Europe was being "distorted" by (EURO)30 billion of state aid 
provided to "legacy airlines", in breach - it claimed - of EU state aid and competition rules.
It said aid for Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Alitalia, SAS, and Norwegian would help fund "many years of below-cost 
selling".
COVID: Ryanair reviewing Boeing orders
Ryanair does not oppose measures to cut passenger taxes, airport taxes, and departure taxes on an industry-wide 
basis, which it said were better options than direct financial aid to airlines.
It does not intend to seek state-guaranteed funding.

Fitch Ratings expects European airlines' average leverage to be roughly 30% higher by 2022 than it had predicted 
before the Covid-19 crisis.   In a research paper on the impact of the pandemic, Fitch predicts that the airlines it 
tracks will come out of the crisis with "notably weaker capital structures", while operating in smaller and more 
competitive markets due to a lagging recovery in demand.   The agency expects leverage to average more than 5x 
in 2021 before falling to above 4.5x by 2022. It had previously expected leverage to be approximately 3.5x by that 
point. 
  In the wake of the crisis, Fitch downgraded a number of European, Middle Eastern and African (EMEA) airlines by 
a single notch and maintained negative rating outlooks. There have not been any multi-notch downgrades to date, it 
noted.   All outlooks are now negative except for Etihad, which has had its rating of A and its outlook of stable 
affirmed by Fitch. The agency said this was based on a "top-down approach" and was due to the airline's "strong 
ties" with the Abu Dhabi government.   The US ratings agency currently supports the continuation of investment 
grade status for European low-cost leaders Ryanair and Wizz, "even though it is difficult to estimate the ultimate 
credit deterioration caused by the pandemic and the economic crisis".
Fitch said both Ryanair and Wizz had "very conservative" high cash balances, at 40% and 55% of their respective 
revenue in the financial year ending 31 March 2019.    It estimated that Ryanair and Wizz Air's strong liquidity would 
decline from these levels during full-year 2021, but would remain sufficient assuming substantial measures to 
preserve cash.   From an adjusted net leverage of "well below" 1.0x as of March 2020, Fitch expects Ryanair and 
Wizz to reach 2.0x by full year 2023, which is "lower than Ryanair's and in line with Wizz Air's current negative 
rating sensitivity, even though we expect their operations will be hammered by the coronavirus leading to 
unsustainably high leverage in FY21".

Ryanair not tempted by sale and leaseback offers

Ryanair has received a number of sale and leaseback (SLB) proposals, but does not need the cash after tapping 
the UK government's Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) for a £600 million ($714 million) loan, chief 
financial officer Neil Sorahan has disclosed.
"There are a lot of opportunities, we have already received a number sale and leaseback proposals, and indeed a 
number of secured debt proposals, but we don't need the cash at the moment, we recently tapped the UK CCFF 
where we drew down £600 million, so the balance sheet is in pretty good shape," Sorahan said in a pre-recorded 
interview on the Ryanair website.
He noted Ryanair's "strong" balance sheet, including (EURO)4.1 billion ($4.3 billion) of cash.
Ryanair group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said the airline had drawn down the CCFF commercial paper 
at "very low cost" as a result of its BBB+ rating.
O'Leary pointed out that 90% of its fleet is owned and 75%, representing 330 Boeing 737s, is unencumbered.
O'Leary said Ryanair was negotiating the extension of existing 737NG aircraft with lessors on the assumption that 
there would be opportunities for growth as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.
Ryanair will not seek to sell any more aircraft for the next 12 to 18 months due to pressure on pricing and will 
instead operate them itself, he added. He sees "significant opportunities" to grow Ryanair's operations in summer 
2021.
Seven 737 NG that have already been sold will be delivered to their new owners in October, he added.
Lease rates for 737 NGs are (EURO)150,000-175,000 per month, he said.
Cash burn has been reduced from (EURO)200 million per week in March to (EURO)60 million now.
This was achieved through pay cuts and pay freezes in April and May; the airline has also benefitted from various 
government payroll support programmes and has removed or deferred non-essential capital expenditure (Capex).
Ryanair not tempted by sale and leaseback offers
Ryanair has 135 firm options for the 737 Max and 75 options and O'Leary expects deliveries to start taking place 
between October and March 2021, assuming the type is recertified in the coming months.
Negotiations with Boeing are taking place over Max compensation, over Max delivery dates, and over a possible 
Max 10 order.
Ryanair will not reinstate its share buyback programme for the foreseeable future, O'Leary said, adding that cash 
would be needed to repay a (EURO)850 million bond that matures in June 2021.
Ryanair subsidiary Lauda is facing an "existential crisis", O'Leary added. The airline was already loss-making 
before the crisis and has had its entire fleet grounded since March.
When it returns to business it will face competition from Austrian Airlines and others, he added.
As a result the only way for it to survive is "deep restructuring". Deliveries of eight leased A320s have been 
cancelled and the Lauda fleet will be capped at 30 aircraft. Existing leases are being renegotiated, O'Leary said.
Over the coming years there was a distinct possibility the Airbus fleet would be replaced with Boeing units.
Its Vienna base is "likely" to be closed if staff don't agree to a new collective labour agreement, O'Leary added.
Ryanair made a (EURO)1 billion profit for the year ending 31 March, up on the (EURO)885 million profit a year 
before. Revenues rose 10% to (EURO)8.49 billion from (EURO)7.69 billion.
Passenger numbers grew 4%, despite the loss of five million passengers in the second half of March.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) said on Friday that resuming flights in July will be more difficult due to the distorted 
competition following the more than 30 billion euros ($32.90 billion) in state aid provided to other airlines in the EU.
The airline company plans to challenge the unlawful state aid bailouts in European courts "to protect fair 
competition in Europe's aviation market."
Ryanair also commenced a restructuring program, which includes up to 3,000 job cuts, unpaid leave, 20% pay cuts 
and the temporary shut down of certain aircraft bases.
The company expects to operate less than 1% of its normal flying capacity in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 
jump to approximately 50% in the fiscal second quarter.
For fiscal 2021, Ryanair expects to carry less than 100 million passengers, which is more than 35% below its initial 
target of 154 million. The company estimates to take until at least summer 2022 to recover passengers and demand 
to 2019 levels.
Ryanair is also in talks with suppliers to cancel aircraft deliveries over the next two years.
The company's shares fell about 4% on Friday morning.

May 01, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair 
said on Friday it planned to axe 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, or 15 percent of staff, with air transport paralysed 
by coronavirus.Dublin-based Ryanair added in a statement that most of its flights would remain grounded until at 
least July and predicted it would take until summer 2022 at the earliest before passenger demand recovers.The 
airline now expects to operate less than one percent of its scheduled flights in April, May and June."The Ryanair 
Airlines will shortly notify their trade unions about its restructuring and job loss program, which will commence from 
July 2020," the group said in a statement."These plans will be subject to consultation but will affect all Ryanair 
Airlines, and may result in the loss of up to 3,000 mainly pilot and cabin crew jobs, unpaid leave, and pay cuts of up 
to 20 percent, and the closure of a number of aircraft bases across Europe until traffic recovers."The cost-cutting 
measures at the airline, which employs 18,000 staff worldwide, will be implemented "as a direct result of the 
unprecedented COVID-19 crisis", it added.Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has meanwhile agreed to extend his 
50-percent pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021."Today we are announcing cuts of just 
over 15 percent, of which we have to lose regrettably about 3,000 mainly pilots and cabin crew over the next three 
to four months," O'Leary told Bloomberg TV."That's because this year we are now facing carrying less than a 100 
million passengers against an original budget of 154 million passengers... The situation is grim.""We expect to be 
allowed by the European governments to go back in July or from July onwards. 
What we are facing now is a historic decline in air traffic in Europe for the next 12-18 months."

May 01, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Donald Trump has said he has 
seen evidence the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, an assertion that threatened on Friday to turn a 
global health emergency into a diplomatic crisis.The US president's statement was immediately undermined by 
intelligence officials and top diplomat Mike Pompeo, who said: "We don't know precisely where it began."But the 
claim -- already denied by Beijing -- could stir tensions even as the World Health Organization asks to be allowed to 
take part in a Chinese investigation into the "animal origins" of the pandemic.The lockdowns that have frozen the 
global economy for weeks continued to ease, with South Africa and Austria allowing some businesses to reopen 
from Friday, joining other parts of Europe and some US states that have begun to emerge in the last few days. But 
optimistic news was tempered by a further haemorrhaging of jobs, with 30 million Americans newly unemployed 
since lockdown began, and Spain joining its European neighbours in confirming an economic collapse.Spain's 
Finance Minister Nadia Calvino said its economy was projected to shrink by 9.2 percent in 2020 -- after growing by 
two percent last year -- while unemployment would jump to 19 percent from an already high 13.8.Underlining the 
slump in consumer demand, Irish airline Ryanair said it was slashing 3,000 positions, forecasting passenger 
numbers would not recover until mid-2022. While death rates slowed in most of Europe, the global toll from the 
pandemic has now topped 230,000.- 'We don't know' -Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to 
humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. 
But speculation -- reinforced by internet rumours and America's right-wing radio shock jocks -- has swirled about a 
top-secret lab, and seems to have been taken up by the US president.Asked if he had seen anything to make him 
think the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the source of the outbreak, Trump replied: "Yes, I have."But he refused to 
give details and Secretary of State Pompeo indicated he had not seen definitive evidence. "We don't know if it came 
from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We don't know if it emanated from the wet market or yet some other place. We 
don't know those answers."The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said analysts would "continue to 
rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine" the origin of the outbreak.In Geneva, a 
spokesman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said several investigations into the source of the virus were 
going on, adding that the global agency was "not currently involved in the studies in China"."WHO would be keen to 
work with international partners and, at the invitation of the Chinese government, to participate in investigation 
around the animal origins," Tarik Jasarevic told AFPBeijing has denied the lab was the source of the virus.Last 
month foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said WHO officials "have repeatedly stated that there is no single 
evidence that the new coronavirus was produced in a laboratory". "Many well-known medical experts in the world 
also believe that the so-called laboratory leak hypothesis has no scientific basis,"Trump is making Beijing's handling 
Trump points finger at China lab as WHO asks to join virus probe
of the outbreak a major issue for his November re-election campaign.When asked about reports that he could 
cancel US debt obligations to China, Trump said he could "do it differently" and act in "more of a forthright 
manner"."I could do the same thing but even for more money, just putting on tariffs," he said.- Lockdowns ease -
The coronavirus has infected at least 3.2 million people so far, with Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin 
becoming the latest high-profile figure to test positive as his country's caseload surged past 100,000. But there was 
some reason for cheer.Germany has accelerated plans to start lifting its lockdown, preparing to ease curbs on 
public life and reopen religious institutions, museums and zoos -- having restarted shopping last week.Neighbouring 
Austria followed suit on Friday with people allowed to go out again freely and gather as long as the group does not 
exceed 10 people -- or 30 for funerals. Those who do not live in the same household must remain one metre (three 
feet) from each other. Masks must worn in shops and public buildings and on public transport. Hairdressers and 
bigger shops are expected to open again from Saturday.Italy, once the world centre of the outbreak, said it was 
hoping to reopen two major airports next week but would move slowly.And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 
recovering from COVID-19, said his country -- which has the world's third-highest death toll, behind the US and Italy 
-- would publish a roadmap next week on easing restrictions.Malaysia said it would reopen for business next week, 
and Australia's government said it could begin easing restrictions soon.

Ryanair plans to phase out its leased Airbus aircraft at subsidiary Lauda and replace them with Boeing aircraft, 
according to Reuters.
In an interview with the newswire on 12 May, Ryanair chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said he planned to 
cancel all Airbus deliveries to the Vienna-based airline over the next 12 months.
This will "probably" be followed by the replacement of those Airbus aircraft with Boeing units over the next couple of 
years, assuming negotiations with the US OEM over Max compensation goes well.
Lauda has a fleet of 26 Airbus A320s, Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker shows.
Four are owned by Aercap and four by GECAS. Standard Chartered Bank owns a further three as does Castlelake 
and Deucalion Aviation Funds.
Horizon Aviation owns two, while Fly Leasing, Aircastle, Dragon Aviation Leasing, SMBC Aviation Capital, Element 
Financial and Genesis Aircraft Services all own one aircraft placed with the carrier.

Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany. Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said Monday Feb. 3, 2020, 
that the grounding of the new Boeing Max jets will delay its growth targets. 
The budget carrier, which is based in Ireland and carries more passengers than any other airline in Europe, plans to 
extend by a year or two its target of flying 200 million people per year. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)The 
outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are 
developments Friday related to the global economy, the work place and the spread of the virus. 
________________________ AIRLINES: The aviation industry is teetering on the edge as travel demand crawls to 
a near standstill but costs remain. — Ryanair plans to cut as many as 3,000 jobs and close bases in Europe amid 
the collapse of travel due to the pandemic. The budget airline announced a restructuring program Friday that 
includes plans for unpaid leave and pay cuts of as much as 20%. It will operate less than 1% of its flights from April 
to June. — Domestic airlines in Thailand are resuming some regular flights, as half of the country's provincial 
airports reopened. Department of Airports Director-General Tawee Kaysisam-ang told reporters that 14 of the 28 
airports his agency oversees reopened Friday. Domestic flights also resumed at airports that serve as international 
gateways, including Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports and Chiang Mai Airport in the north. 
Airlines resuming flights from these normally high-traffic airports include Nok Air, Thai AirAsia, Thai Lion Air and 
Thai Vietjet Air. MAY DAY: Protests and rallies typically mark the international Labor Day, but this year's events 
look markedly different due to COVID-19. — Some Italian entrepreneurs are looking to draw attention to their plight 
on the nation's May Day holiday. Some cafes put dressed mannequins in poses as if they were buying products or 
sipping coffee at counters in their empty businesses. In towns from north to south, many small business owners on 
Friday stood at a safe distance from each other on the sidewalk or in town squares, their shuttered stores or 
restaurants behind them, wearing black masks and holding placards highlighting their economic troubles. On 
Monday, restaurants and cafes can start offering takeout. Non-essential shops can reopen on May 18 if Italy's rate 
of contagion with COVID-19 doesn't sharply rise again. — For May Day, the capital in tech-savvy Finland replaced 
parades and speeches with virtual reality. Helsinki had been encouraging residents to mark the eve before May Day 
— one of the Nordic country's main public festivities especially among youth — through attending a virtual concert 
by popular local rap duo JVG.  — A prominent workers' union in Croatia held an online Labor Day protest as the 
lockdown against the new coronavirus prevented traditional gatherings and demonstrations. The Association of 
Independent Unions of Croatia gathered 100 participants via video conference for an hour on Friday while 
thousands more followed on social networks. The participants discussed workers' problems and what will come 
Ryanair to cut up to 3,000 jobs, May Day looks different
after the outbreak. TECHNOLOGY: With an overabundance of COVID-19 patients, the healthcare section is 
increasingly turning to technology to aid in the fight against the outbreak. — Robot staff have debuted at a Tokyo 
hotel for mildly-sick coronavirus patients under a new plan to free up beds at hospitals overburdened with more 
severe cases. Pepper, a semi-humanoid talking robot, greets new entrants at the lobby and reminds patients to 
check their daily temperature and encourages them to rest. 'Whiz,' a cleaner robot, will operate in areas where 
patients come to pick up meals and other daily necessities. Guest patients can also access health management 
applications on computers and tablets to record their own body temperatures and symptoms. The robots, both 
made by SoftBank Robotics, will also be deployed at other hotels rented by Tokyo's metropolitan government for 
patients with no or mild symptoms. CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS &#38; BANKS: Countries are moving toward 
easing strict stay-at-home orders, but the economic fallout from the virus is becoming more clear.  — Spain's 
government expects that the eurozone's fourth largest economy will shrink by 9.2% this year and that 
unemployment will reach 19% of the working-age population. The announcement comes a day after Spain's 
government said that the nation's economy had shrunk by 5.2% in the first quarter of 2020, ending 25 consecutive 
quarters of positive economic activity dating back to 2013. — Malaysia will allow most economic sectors and 
business activities to reopen Monday, days before a two-month lockdown is due to end after infections fell sharply 
in recent weeks. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin says there is a need to revive the economy, as the country has 
lost 63 billion ringgit ($14.7 billion) since a partial lockdown began March 18.  — Malta's Prime Minister Robert 
Abela says non-essential shops will be allowed to re-open on Monday. Health services, not related to coronavirus 
infections and which had been suspended, will also resume. Bars and restaurants will remain closed, with the 
government reviewing its position on them in three weeks. Malta's airport and ports will remain closed indefinitely. 
MARKETS: — Stocks are falling in early trading on Wall Street Friday as major U.S. companies provide details of 
how the coronavirus is disrupting their businesses. 10 Dividend Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now[1]The stock market is 
having its worst week since the financial crisis. For some investors, a flight to safety has them getting out of the 
market. But other investors are taking a flight to quality. And when it comes to quality in equities, these are the 
moments when dividend stocks shine. Already JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are projecting that the coronavirus may wipe out corporate earnings growth for 2020. If 
investors can't count on their equities to provide capital gains, they look to dividends to boost their total return. But 
like any investment, not all dividend stocks are alike. Some of the best dividend stocks are the dividend aristocrats. 
By definition, for a company to become a dividend aristocrat, they must have at least 25 consecutive years of 
dividend growth (not just issued a dividend). These companies have a proven track record of weathering market 
turbulence and delivering solid performance. And, right now, there are only 64 of these companies. In this 
presentation, we'll give you 10 dividend aristocrat stocks you can invest in right now. View the "10 Dividend 
Aristocrat Stocks to Buy Now"[2]. [ 1]: https://www.marketbeat.com/slideshows/10-dividend-aristocrat-stocks-to-buy-

May 01, 2020( Pressat: http://www.pressat.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Friday 1 May, 2020 LONDON, United 
Kingdom, 1 May 2020Up to 7bn is owed to consumers due to flights and holidays which have been cancelled by 
airlines and tour operators due to the Coronavirus crisis. Whilst some airlines are offering refunds, many others are 
delaying refunds or, in the most egregious cases of all, point blank refusing refunds. 
Amongst those refusing refunds, or failing to give definitive timescales for payment, are Ryanair, KLM, and Air 
France, all of whom have released clear announcements that they will not be issuing refunds. Notwithstanding the 
challenges which the airline industry is facing during the pandemic, airlines must obey consumer protection laws 
which are in place to protect the customers' rights and interests.According to the EU Regulation 261/2004 (airlines) 
and EU Directive 2015/2302 (travel package), both mandatory laws, passengers with cancelled flights must be 
offered a choice of re-routing under comparable transport conditions, to their final destination at the earliest 
opportunity; or reimbursement of the full cost of the ticket at the price at which it was bought, within seven days. 
Whilst suggestions have been made that the rights under these laws may be suspended, consumers may still seek 
full refunds and compensation for distress and inconvenience under the Consumer Rights Act and the Consumer 
Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations. These are UK laws and any EU decision will have no impact upon 
these.SPG Law, the leading class action law firm in the UK, is today launching litigation against Ryanair, KLM, and 
Air France on behalf of consumers. Hundreds of affected passengers have already contacted SPG Law and test 
claims will be issued in the English courts in the coming days. The lawsuits will not only demand that the airlines 
fully refund the costs of customers' tickets, but also seek additional damages for stress, inconvenience, and 
commercial misconduct by the airlines. In order to be represented by SPG Law, affected passengers must be 
residents of the United Kingdom who have purchased tickets with Ryanair, KLM or Air France. SPG Law operates 
on a no-win, no-fee basis, and if successful will offer claimants 100% of the refund of the cost of their flights but will 
charge 50% of any damages recovered for stress, inconvenience and commercial misconduct. SPG Law Managing 
Partner, Thomas Goodhead, said in regard to the airlines' misconduct that 'Whilst all of us who travel frequently are 
able to empathise with the commercial conditions that airlines face, it is highly unethical that they should seek to 
finance their businesses by unlawfully withholding monies which belong to consumers. After the crisis is over, 
consumers will remember which airlines acted honourably and which ones chose to prioritise their balance sheets 
over their customers' bank accounts.' To make a claim or for more information regarding the airline refunds' class-

on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, 
especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF 
THE HOUR: — May brings reopenings around the globe as virus toll climbs. — Protesters gather in Greece for May 
Day. — Australian business leaders rattled over China's threat of trade repercussions over virus probe. — Ryanair 
looks to slash jobs and close bases due to the coronavirus pandemic. ___ ATHENS, Greece — Protesters have 
begun gathering in central Athens for traditional May Day marches, despite authorities' pleas to unions to move 
their demonstrations to next week, after lockdown measures begin easing. More than 100 people from the 
communist party-affiliated PAME union gathered in Athens's main Syntagma Square, outside Parliament. Holding 
banners and red flags, and most wearing masks and gloves, the protesters stood roughly two meters (6.5 feet) 
apart from each other as they waited for the march to begin. 'The symbolic events for May Day being organized as 
always by the labor unions, with all necessary protection measures, with them wearing masks and maintaining the 
necessary distance between them, do not constitute a danger for everything the people have won until today by 
adhering to the restrictive measures' of the lockdown, the Communist Party said in an announcement. Greek 
authorities have repeatedly warned people that this year, May Day will have to be different, saying the lockdown 
measures due to be partially lifted starting Monday are still very much in effect. Civil Protection Deputy Minister 
Nikos Hardalias has stressed Greeks will not be able to go on countryside trips as they frequently do, and he 
appealed to trade unions to transfer their usual May Day marches to the first Saturday after lockdown restrictions 
have been eased. 'We welcome May Day with truly spring weather. Like during Easter, we will spend (the day) 
differently,' Hardalias said during his daily briefing Thursday. 'Either at home, or with a walk near it .... I repeat that 
trips far from our permanent residence is not allowed. We are not allowed to go to our country home, certainly not to 
our village.' But unions were to go ahead anyway with more than a dozen marches or commemorations planned, 
especially in central Athens. ___ CANBERRA, Australia — China's warning of trade repercussions from Australia's 
campaign for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic has rattled Australian business leaders as U.S. 
President Donald Trump's administration urges other governments to back such a probe. China has accused 
Australia of parroting the United States in its call for an inquiry independent of the World Health Organization to

determine the origins of COVID-19 and how the world responded. Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye used an 
Australian newspaper interview this week to warn that pursuing an inquiry could spark a Chinese consumer boycott. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has defended Australia and urges other countries to demand transparency. 
___ LONDON — Ryanair has announced plans to slash as many as 3,000 jobs and close bases in Europe amid the 
collapse of travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group announced a restructuring program Friday that 
included plans for unpaid leave and pay cuts of as much as 20%. The budget airline says will operate less than 1% 
of its flights from April to June and that passenger numbers will not return to 2019 levels 'until summer 2022 at the 
earliest.'' The airline group also says it is 'active negotiations' with Boeing to cut the number of planned aircraft 
deliveries over the next 24 months. ___ NEW DELHI — India has registered another daily high in coronavirus 
cases, with nearly 2,000 recorded in the past 24 hours.  India's Health Ministry said Friday the 1,993 new cases and 
73 more deaths bring the country's totals to 35,043 with 1,147 deaths.  The government is due to decide the future 
of its 40-day lockdown on Sunday. It allowed migrant workers and other stranded people to resume their journeys 
on Wednesday, as well as some shops to reopen and manufacturing and farming to resume. ___ ISLAMABAD — 
The speaker of Pakistan's lower house of parliament has confirmed he tested positive for the new coronavirus. The 
announcement by Asad Qaiser comes as the poverty-stricken country recorded 24 more deaths from COVID-19, 
the illness caused by the virus, in the last 24 hours. Qaiser, speaker of the National Assembly, announced 
Thursday on Twitter that he had quarantined himself at home. Qaiser is the highest-ranking official in Pakistan to 
publicly acknowledge testing positive for the virus. As of Friday, there were nearly 17,000 confirmed cases in 
Pakistan, including 383 fatalities. ___ TOKYO — Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, tasked with Japan's 
coronavirus measures, met with a panel of experts Friday and said social distancing efforts under the state of 
emergency should be kept in place for a while to prevent a resurgence of infections. Nishimura quoted experts on 
the government-commissioned task force as saying the spread has slowed — but not enough. 'If we relax the 
measures with insufficient decrease, infections will immediately bounce back and our effort so far will entirely go to 
waste,' Nishimura said. 'The experts recommended that the current measures should be kept in place.' Prime 
Minister Shinzo Abe declared a month-long state of emergency on April 7 in Tokyo and six other urban areas, 
requesting residents stay at home. He later expanded the guidelines to the entire country. Requests for 
nonessential business closures were also issued in Tokyo and several other prefectures. Abe said Thursday he 
planned to extend the state of emergency beyond its scheduled end on May 6 because infections are spreading 
and hospitals are overburdened. He is expected to announce a decision within days.  Local governors in hard-hit 
areas and health experts concerned about the collapse of medical systems have called for a month-long extension. 
Japan has 14,281 confirmed cases, up 182 from the day before, with 432 deaths, according to the health ministry 
tally Friday. ___ KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia will allow most economic sectors and business activities 
to reopen Monday, days before a two-month lockdown is scheduled to end. After coronavirus infections fell sharply 
in recent weeks, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin says there is a need to revive the economy as the country has 
lost 63 billion ringgit ($14.7 billion) since a partial lockdown began March 18. It is due to end May 12, but Muhyiddin 
says most businesses, including restaurants, can open their doors beginning Monday with strict social distancing 
rules and health guidelines in effect.  That includes health screening for staff and customers, and registering details 
of visitors. In a televised May Day speech, Muhyiddin said mass gatherings will still be banned, which means places 
such as schools, cinemas and worship houses will stay shut, and group sports are prohibited.  Muhyiddin also said 
Muslims cannot return to their villages to celebrate the end of the fasting month, as interstate travel will remain 
banned. He urged Malaysians to embrace the new norm of life amid a cautious approach to ending the lockdown.  
Daily infections have dropped to double digits in the past two weeks, with Malaysia now reporting 6,002 infections 
and 102 deaths.  ___ TOKYO — Japan's Emperor Naruhito marked the first anniversary of his enthronement Friday 
with a prayer at palace shrines for the people's peace and happiness amid the coronavirus pandemic. Naruhito, 
wearing a white surgical mask, greeted well-wishers on the sidewalk from a royal car on the way to the palace for 
the closed ritual. Naruhito, 60, ascended to the Chrysanthemum throne on May 1 last year, the day after his father, 
Akihito, abdicated. Some of Naruhito's scheduled events, including part of his birthday celebration in February and 
a trip to Britain that was supposed to be his first overseas visit as the monarch, have been canceled due to the 
pandemic. Naruhito and his wife, Emperor Masako, have been receiving information from coronavirus experts about 
the latest developments. ___ BEIJING — Beijing's parks and museums, including the ancient Forbidden City, 
reopened to the public Friday after being closed for months due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Forbidden City, 
past home to China's emperors, is permitting just 5,000 visitors daily, down from 80,000. And parks are allowing 
people to visit at 30% of the usual capacity.  Large-scale group activities remain on hold and visitors must book 
The Latest: Protesters in Greece gather for May Day
tickets in advance online, according to Gao Dawei, deputy director of the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau.  
Beijing on Thursday downgraded its level of emergency response to the virus from first to second tier, but 
temperature checks and social distancing remain in force. The change comes at the start of the five-day May 1 
holiday and in advance of China's rescheduled gathering of the National People's Congress on May 22. China 
reported 12 new virus cases Friday, six brought from overseas, and no new deaths for the 16th consecutive day.  
___ SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported nine new coronavirus cases as infections continue to wane. 
The figures released by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought national totals 
to 10,774 infections and 248 deaths. None of the new cases were from the hardest-hit city of Daegu, where more 
than 6,800 people have been sickened since February. The KCDC says at least 1,073 cases have been linked to 
passengers arriving from overseas, but such infections have also slowed in recent weeks amid stronger border 
controls. The country was reporting around 500 new cases a day in early March, but it hasn't seen a daily jump 
above 100 since April 1. The slowing caseload has allowed the government to relax social distancing guidelines as 
it shifts focus to easing the shock on the economy. ___ Follow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at

May 01, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In this Sept. 12, 2018 file photo, a 
Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany. Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said Monday Feb. 3, 2020, 
that the grounding of the new Boeing Max jets will delay its growth targets. 
The budget carrier, which is based in Ireland and carries more passengers than any other airline in Europe, plans to 
extend by a year or two its target of flying 200 million people per year. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)The 
outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are 
developments Friday related to the global economy, the work place and the spread of the virus. 
________________________ AIRLINES: The aviation industry is teetering on the edge as travel demand crawls to 
a near standstill but costs remain. — Boeing says that because it raised $25 billion from a sale of bonds it doesn't 
plan to ask the federal government for a loan. The company announced this week it will cut 10% of its 161,000-
person work force through attrition, early-out offers and layoffs. — The Transportation Security Administration 
screened 154,695 people at airports on Thursday, its busiest day since March 29. That was still down 94% from the 
same Thursday a year ago, however. Airline executives say they are seeing a very slight increase in bookings, 
mostly for flights at least 90 days from now. — Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines said Friday they will soon 
require that passengers cover their faces during flights. With those announcements, all of the six largest U.S. 
airlines will begin recovering face masks or coverings, some starting on Monday. JetBlue Airways was the first to 
announce such a policy on Monday. Delta, American and United followed suit on Thursday. — The incoming CEO 
of United Airlines, Scott Kirby, said that if air travel remains very low on Oct. 1, the company will have to lay off 
workers and further cut the hours of other employees. United got $5 billion in federal aid to help cover payroll costs 
through September. Analysts believe layoffs are likely in October unless the airlines get more help from the 
government. Kirby is United's president and will succeed the retiring Oscar Munoz as CEO later this month. — 
Ryanair plans to cut as many as 3,000 jobs and close bases in Europe amid the collapse of travel due to the 
pandemic. It will operate less than 1% of its flights from April to June. — Domestic airlines in Thailand are resuming 
some regular flights, as half of the country's provincial airports reopened. Department of Airports Director-General 
Tawee Kaysisam-ang told reporters that 14 of the 28 airports his agency oversees reopened Friday. MAY DAY: 
Protests and rallies typically mark the international Labor Day, but this year's events look markedly different due to 
COVID-19. — Some Italian entrepreneurs looked to draw attention to their plight on the nation's May Day holiday. 
Some cafes put dressed mannequins in poses as if they were buying products or sipping coffee at counters in their 
empty businesses. — The capital in tech-savvy Finland replaced parades and speeches with virtual reality. Helsinki 
had been encouraging residents to mark the eve before May Day — one of the Nordic country's main public 
Boeing says it won't seek government aid; an odd May Day
festivities especially among youth — through attending a virtual concert by popular local rap duo JVG.  — A 
prominent workers' union in Croatia held an online Labor Day protest as the lockdown against the new coronavirus 
prevented traditional gatherings and demonstrations. TECHNOLOGY: With an overabundance of COVID-19 
patients, the healthcare section is increasingly turning to technology to aid in the fight against the outbreak. — 
Robot staff have debuted at a Tokyo hotel for mildly-sick coronavirus patients under a new plan to free up beds at 
hospitals overburdened with more severe cases. Pepper, a semi-humanoid talking robot, greets new entrants at the 
lobby and reminds patients to check their daily temperature and encourages them to rest. 'Whiz,' a cleaner robot, 
will operate in areas where patients come to pick up meals and other daily necessities. CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENTS &#38; BANKS: Countries are moving toward easing strict stay-at-home orders, but the economic 
fallout from the virus is becoming more clear.  — Spain's government expects that the eurozone's fourth largest 
economy will shrink by 9.2% this year and that unemployment will reach 19% of the working-age population. — 
Malaysia will allow most economic sectors and business activities to reopen Monday, days before a two-month 
lockdown is due to end after infections fell sharply in recent weeks. — Malta's Prime Minister Robert Abela says 
non-essential shops will be allowed to re-open on Monday. Health services, not related to coronavirus infections 
and which had been suspended, will also resume.  MARKETS: — Stocks retreated on Wall Street Friday after 
Amazon and other big companies laid out how the coronavirus pandemic is hitting their bottom lines. Companies 
Mentioned in This Article 7 Stocks to Buy Before the Economy Reopens[1]Anyone who pretends they know when 
the economy will reopen is not telling you the truth. And more importantly, what reopening the economy is going to 
look like is anybody's guess. For certain we're not going to be seeing anything that resembles business as usual. 
And more likely than not, this will not be the 'V-shaped' recovery that some analysts are predicting. Restaurants 
may be open, but seating capacity is likely to be limited as social distancing will remain the custom. Live sports may 
return, but it's not unreasonable to expect that games will be played without fans, or at least with very few fans in 
attendance. And there are other considerations as well. Workers will be allowed to go back to work, but after 
discovering the time value of working from home will they want to. And maybe equally as important, will employers 
want them to come into the office? These are fascinating scenarios that will define the post-virus, pre-vaccine 
economy. But as an investor, you know that there are stocks you can buy right now that will be ready to flourish 
when the economy reopens. On this list, we're not looking at theme parks or airlines. They will come around, but 
slowly. Instead, we've picked seven stocks in different sectors that stand to benefit as the economy finds its new 
normal.

May 01, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Reuters Ryanair[1] 
said it would fly less than 1% of its schedule in June, as the airline industry goes sideways in the midst of the 
coronavirus[2] pandemic. It also said it would cut about 15% of its workforce, totaling about 3,000 jobs, while 
exploring pay cuts and voluntary leaves for other employees. In a statement, the airline[3] accused European 
governments of providing unfair aid to competitors during the crisis. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[4]. The European low-cost airline Ryanair said Friday that it 
would operate less than 1% of its normal schedule in June and is planning to cut 3,000 jobs, warning that it expects 
its recovery from the coronavirus to take at least two years. Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, the 
Ireland-based carrier said that it would implement a restructuring program starting in July, eliminating the positions. 
The 3,000 jobs would equal about 15% of Ryanair's workforce. The airline said it expects to carry fewer than 
150,000 passengers from May through July, as travel restrictions and anxieties over the pandemic persist in 
Europe. It had originally projected 42.4 million passengers during the quarter. Although it said that it expected some 
demand to resume between July and September, it expected less than half of the 44.6 million passengers it had 
previously planned for. "Ryanair now expects the recovery of passenger demand and pricing (to 2019 levels) will 
take at least 2 years, until summer 2022 at the earliest," the airline said in a statement[5] to investors, adding that it 
expected to report a net loss of over €100 million (about $109.8 million) for the quarter ending in June. In addition to 
the job cuts, which will mainly affect flight attendants and pilots, the airline is also looking at pay cuts of up to 20%, 
as well as offering unpaid leaves to some employees and closing bases across Europe. CEO Michael O'Leary has 
cut his pay by 50%. In the statement, Ryanair also accused European governments of bailing out competitors 
unfairly, saying that airlines such as Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, and Alitalia will be able to undercut the budget 
carrier on price. "When Ryanair returns to meaningful flying from July, the competitive landscape in Europe will be 
distorted by unprecedented volumes of State Aid from some EU Governments to their 'national' airlines," the 
company said. "Currently this amounts to over €30 billion." The global airline industry has been roiled by the 
coronavirus pandemic. Various stay-at-home orders, border closures, and calls for social distancing have tanked 
travel demand. Airlines have responded by suspending routes, cancelling flights, and grounding planes.NOW

cases. Pepper, a semi-humanoid talking robot, greets new entrants at the lobby and reminds patients to check their 
daily temperature and encourages them to rest. 'Whiz,' a cleaner robot, will operate in areas where patients come to 
pick up meals and other daily necessities. Guest patients can also access health management applications on 
computers and tablets to record their own body temperatures and symptoms. The robots, both made by SoftBank 
Robotics, will also be deployed at other hotels rented by Tokyo's metropolitan government for patients with no or 
mild symptoms. CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS &#38; BANKS: Countries are moving toward easing strict stay-at-
home orders, but the economic fallout from the virus is becoming more clear.  — Spain's government expects that 
the eurozone's fourth largest economy will shrink by 9.2% this year and that unemployment will reach 19% of the 
working-age population. The announcement comes a day after Spain's government said that the nation's economy 
had shrunk by 5.2% in the first quarter of 2020, ending 25 consecutive quarters of positive economic activity dating 
back to 2013. — Malaysia will allow most economic sectors and business activities to reopen Monday, days before 
a two-month lockdown is due to end after infections fell sharply in recent weeks. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin 
says there is a need to revive the economy, as the country has lost 63 billion ringgit ($14.7 billion) since a partial 
lockdown began March 18.  MARKETS: — Shares dropped in Europe and Asia on Friday after the latest data drove

Dow is hovering around 30,000 and the S&#38;P 500 is trading near 3,300. S&#38;P 500 stocks are trading at 
nearly 25 times their annual earnings, well above historical norms. At the same time, interest rates are near all-time 
lows. 10-year Treasuries are yielding just 1.8% and collectively S&#38;P 500 stocks are yielding under 2%. Some 
investors think that it's too challenging to find safe and affordable securities that pay 4%, 5%, and even 6% yields. 
Searching for yield isn't easy in an environment where high asset prices have driven down dividend yields, but there 
are a few meaningful options to find yield. With interest rates slowly beginning to rise, investors have found dividend 
stocks slightly less attractive. This has created a small group of cheap dividend stocks to buy, many of which have 
yields twice as large as the 10-year Treasury. Let's review some of the best cheap dividend stocks in the market

Ryanair plane parks at the airport in Weeze, Germany. Europe's busiest airline, Ryanair, said Monday Feb. 3, 2020, 
that the grounding of the new Boeing Max jets will delay its growth targets.

on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, 
especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF 
THE HOUR: — Virus worries for workers demanding rights on May Day. — Japan to extend its state of emergency 
another month. — Spain field hospital releases its last patients. — French president thanks workers on Labor Day 
holiday. ___ TOKYO — Robot staff debuted at a Tokyo hotel for mild coronavirus patients under a plan to free up 
beds at overburdened hospitals. Pepper, a popular semi-humanoid talking robot, greeted Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike 
as she walked into a downtown hotel during Friday's demonstration. Pepper, wearing a white surgical mask, also 
reminds patients to check their daily temperature and encourages them to rest. Doctors and nurses are staffed at 
the hotels. Guest patients can also access health management applications on computers and tablets to record 
their body temperatures and symptoms. 'Whiz' a cleaner robot, operates in hotel lobbies where patients come to 
pick up meals to reduce infection risks. The robots, made by SoftBank Robotics, will be deployed at other hotels 
rented by Tokyo's government for patients with no or mild symptoms. So far, Tokyo has secured five hotels with 
1,500 to 2,800 rooms. Japan has 14,281 confirmed cases and 432 deaths, according to the health ministry tally. 
___ BANGKOK — Domestic airlines in Thailand are resuming some regular flights, with half the country's provincial 
airports reopened. Department of Airports Director-General Tawee Kaysisam-ang says 14 of the 28 airports his 
agency oversees reopened Friday. Domestic flights also resumed at airports that serve as international gateways, 
including Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang airports and Chiang Mai Airport in the north.  International 
passenger flight arrivals remain banned. All airports must implement social distancing measures. Passengers 
should wear masks and stand in designated spots to check in. The airlines are supposed to sell only one in three of 
each flight's seats to keep passengers apart. A spokesman for Don Mueang Airport says it would service 150 
arrivals and departures carrying 3,000-4,000 passengers Friday, compared to the four or five flights a day in recent 
weeks.  ___ VALLETTA, Malta — Malta's government has announced the relaxation of some coronavirus 
restrictions.  Prime Minister Robert Abela says starting Monday, nonessential shops will be allowed to reopen. 
Health services, not related to coronavirus infections, will be resumed.  Bars and restaurants will remain shuttered. 
The government says it will review its position in three weeks.  Malta's airport and ports will remain closed

indefinitely. People in groups of more than four persons in public places will be fined.  Malta has 467 confirmed 
coronavirus cases and four deaths. ___ TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says the coronavirus state 
of emergency to end next week will be extended about a month. Abe, citing a report by experts on a government 
task force, says Japanese medical systems are still under severe pressure with the number of confirmed cases far 
exceeding 10,000. Japan has averted the explosive of infections in many other countries and the spread of the 
infections has somewhat slowed under the ongoing state of emergency. Abe says, 'We still need you to continue 
cooperating, and that's the experts' view." He says he instructed Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is 
tasked with the coronavirus measures, to extend the measures 'for about a month.' Abe says he will announce 
details Monday. Shigeru Omi, deputy chair of the panel and a public health expert formerly with the World Health 
Organization, says the infections have not slowed as much as experts had hoped. He says, 'If the resurgence 
occurs, medical systems will be quickly overburdened."  Japan has more than 14,000 cases and over 400 deaths, 
according to the health ministry. However, experts say there could be several times more patients. ___ MADRID — 
Spain is shuttering the massive field hospital that that its army helped set up in a Madrid convention center at the 
height of the coronavirus outbreak. The field hospital established inside Madrid's IFEMA convention center released 
its last patients on Friday, as local politicians held a ceremony to close its doors. Nearly 4,000 patients have been 
treated at the IFEMA field hospital. Its installations will be kept intact for weeks in case the virus makes a rebound. 
Spain has nearly 25,000 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 after almost 300 new fatalities were reported on Friday. 
Spain has over 215,000 confirmed coronavirus infections following a daily increase of more than 1,100 cases. The 
country is preparing for its largest rollback of lockdown measures on Saturday when people of all ages will be 
allowed to leave their homes for short walks or exercise for the first time since March 14. The lockdown has 
succeeded in reducing daily case increases of over 20% to under 1%. More than 114,00 Spaniards have been 
treated for the virus and released from care. ___ PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has led the 
country's Labor Day holiday with a message of thanks to workers saving people's lives during the coronavirus crisis. 
Forgoing his usual televised address, Macron tweeted out a prerecorded speech Friday recognizing that 'the nation 
is holding on' thanks to the life-saving 'dedication of our caregivers, civil defense personnel, law enforcement (and) 
armies.' Macron also thanked the commitment of French farmers and public servants who have enabled many to 
continue to work from home. Labor Day has, since after World War II in France, been an occasion to campaign for 
and celebrate workers' rights. He said 'the spirit of solidarity between workers, has perhaps never been so powerful' 
as now. However, a midday musical protest against Macron's handling of the epidemic is taking place from the 
balconies and widows of confined citizens to the tune of the rebel's anthem Bella Ciao, in the French spirit of 
keeping their leaders in check. CGT Union chief Philippe Martinez raised specific concerns on France Inter radio 
Friday, critiquing plans for some schools to open on May 11 and that teachers could refuse to return to work 'if the 
health of school employees is not ensured, and that of the children.' ___ ROME — Italy's May Day traditions, which 
pay tribute to the role of workers in society, have been upended by lockdown rules forbidding gatherings during the 
coronavirus pandemic.  Italy's May Day commemoration have been rallies led by union leaders, followed by an 
evening rock and pop music concert in Rome, drawing crowds sometimes topping 100,000 in the square outside St. 
John in Lateran Basilica.  This year, musical artists will take turns performing solo in venues without anyone in the 
audience. Their music will be broadcast on TV and by state radio, with the evening's theme being, 'Working in 
safety to build a future.'  Unions have been demanding scrupulous attention to safety measures, including social 
distancing at work stations and assembly lines, hygiene and sanitizing before factories can reopen in Italy, where 
Europe's devastating outbreak of COVID-19 began.  Right-wing political opposition leader Matteo Salvini has 
accused the center-left government of pandering to union demands in slowly getting the country's economy moving 
again.  On Monday, some lockdown restrictions will be eased, with some 3 million Italians expected to return to 
workplaces, many in factories.  ___ MADRID — Spain's government expects that the Eurozone's fourth largest 
economy will shrink by 9.2% this year and unemployment will reach 19% of the working-age population. Deputy 
Prime Minister Nadia Calviño announced the grim forecast on Friday when she explained Spain's economic stability 
plan that it has presented to the European Union. This comes a day after Spain's government said that the nation's 
economy had shrunk by 5.2% in the first quarter of 2020, ending 25 consecutive quarters of positive economic 
activity dating back to 2013. Calviño said the government expects the economy to rebound strong, with a growth of 
6.8% in 2021. Hundreds of thousands of workers have been furloughed since Spain applied strict stay-at-home 
rules on March 14 when it declared a state of emergency that is still in effect. The government unveiled this week a 
complex series of guidelines it will follow to reactivate the economy and social life of the country over the coming 
weeks and months as long as there is not another jump in COVID-19 infections. Spain has over 24,000 confirmed 
The Latest: Robot staff greet Tokyo governor at virus hotel
deaths from the new virus. ___ ATHENS, Greece — Hundreds of protesters gathered in central Athens and the 
northern Greek city of Thessaloniki to mark May Day, despite appeals from the government for May Day marches 
and commemorations to be postponed until next Saturday, when some lockdown measures will have been lifted. 
Hundreds of members of the Communist Party-backed PAME union gathered in both cities Friday morning, wearing 
masks and gloves and standing two meters apart. The union released photos showing organizers using measuring 
tape and square colored stickers to lay out the exact positions where protesters could stand for the rally in central 
Athens, outside Parliament. This year, May Day is being celebrated 'under the special, difficult circumstances of the 
coronavirus pandemic, but with our sight turned to the day after,' Communist Party head Dimitris Koutsoumbas said 
during the rally. The main issue for after the pandemic, he said, was the dilemma of 'socialism or barbarity. We 
answer socialism. A new, fair society is needed, with the working classes, the people, truly in power.' Dozens of 
other unions also planned marches or commemorations, with demonstrators generally using masks and maintaining 
distance from each other. Separately, police were out in force Friday to ensure Greeks don't head out to the 
countryside, a tradition for May Day. Lockdown measures are to be eased on Monday, but remain in force for the 
holiday weekend. Violators face 150 euro fines. ___ JOHANNESBURG — A holiday atmosphere enlivened South 
Africa's streets as the May Day public holiday is also when the country has begun easing its strict lockdown.  For 
the first time in five weeks, people were permitted to walk outside for exercise between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., and 
thousands, with mandated facemasks and keeping distance, were out walking through the streets.  Some South 
Africans will be able to return to work in small batches and many businesses will resume limited operations. Many 
factories can resume operations in phases, starting with only a third of employees allowed to return and must abide 
by distancing and other guidelines.  Public transport, including trains and buses, will begin operating with a 
restricted number of passengers. Even with the easing, South Africa's lockdown remains strict, with no sales of 
liquor and cigarettes permitted. Ordinarily, South Africa marks May Day with rallies by trade unions and political 
parties, but these are not possible because of the lockdown regulations. 'We want to take this opportunity to pay 
special dedication to our frontline health workers who are confronting this virus on daily basis in this difficult time,' 
said Jacob Khawe, secretary in Johannesburg of the ruling African National Congress party. ___ MOSCOW — 
Russia registered almost 8,000 new coronavirus cases on Friday in yet another record daily spike, bringing the total 
to 114,431. The number of cases is likely to be much higher as not everyone gets tested, and tests in Russia were 
reported to be only 70-80% accurate. In at least five Russian regions, health officials registered a surge of 
pneumonia cases. In Moscow, which accounts for half of all virus cases, all respiratory infections are likely to be 
caused by the coronavirus, according to the public health agency Rospotrebnadzor. On Thursday, Russia's Prime 
Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced testing positive for the new virus and temporarily stepping back from running 
the Cabinet. ___ COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Friday that 'where we 
stand now means not everyone can return to work as they did before the corona crisis.' The Scandinavian country 
has slowly reopened by allowing some classes to return to school and hairdressers, physiotherapists and tattoo 
parlors, among others, as well as courts of law to reopen. Frederiksen, a Social Democrat, said details of phase two 
of the reopening of Denmark would be announced 'just before May 10.' In neighboring Norway, Jonas Gahr Stoere, 
head of Norway's Labour Party which is the opposition, said in a May Day speech that 'instead of gathering in the 
squares around the country and proudly parade with flags and band music, many of us will sit in front of a screen 
and follow the May 1 events online.' Gahr Stoere said 'we are in the midst of a crisis that is hitting hard and wide.' 
___ ATHENS, Greece — Protesters have begun gathering in central Athens for traditional May Day marches, 
despite authorities' pleas to unions to move their demonstrations to next week, after lockdown measures begin 
easing. More than 100 people from the communist party-affiliated PAME union gathered in Athens's main 
Syntagma Square, outside Parliament. Holding banners and red flags, and most wearing masks and gloves, the 
protesters stood roughly two meters (6.5 feet) apart from each other as they waited for the march to begin. 'The 
symbolic events for May Day being organized as always by the labor unions, with all necessary protection 
measures, with them wearing masks and maintaining the necessary distance between them, do not constitute a 
danger for everything the people have won until today by adhering to the restrictive measures' of the lockdown, the 
Communist Party said in an announcement. Greek authorities have repeatedly warned people that this year, May 
Day will have to be different, saying the lockdown measures due to be partially lifted starting Monday are still very 
much in effect. Civil Protection Deputy Minister Nikos Hardalias has stressed Greeks will not be able to go on 
countryside trips as they frequently do, and he appealed to trade unions to transfer their usual May Day marches to 
the first Saturday after lockdown restrictions have been eased. 'We welcome May Day with truly spring weather. 
Like during Easter, we will spend (the day) differently,' Hardalias said during his daily briefing Thursday. 'Either at 
The Latest: Robot staff greet Tokyo governor at virus hotel
home, or with a walk near it .... I repeat that trips far from our permanent residence is not allowed. We are not 
allowed to go to our country home, certainly not to our village.' But unions were to go ahead anyway with more than 
a dozen marches or commemorations planned, especially in central Athens. ___ CANBERRA, Australia — China's 
warning of trade repercussions from Australia's campaign for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic 
has rattled Australian business leaders as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration urges other governments 
to back such a probe. China has accused Australia of parroting the United States in its call for an inquiry 
independent of the World Health Organization to determine the origins of COVID-19 and how the world responded. 
Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye used an Australian newspaper interview this week to warn that pursuing an 
inquiry could spark a Chinese consumer boycott. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has defended Australia and 
urges other countries to demand transparency. ___ LONDON — Ryanair has announced plans to slash as many as 
3,000 jobs and close bases in Europe amid the collapse of travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group 
announced a restructuring program Friday that included plans for unpaid leave and pay cuts of as much as 20%. 
The budget airline says will operate less than 1% of its flights from April to June and that passenger numbers will 
not return to 2019 levels 'until summer 2022 at the earliest.'' The airline group also says it is 'active negotiations' 
with Boeing to cut the number of planned aircraft deliveries over the next 24 months. ___ NEW DELHI — India has 
registered another daily high in coronavirus cases, with nearly 2,000 recorded in the past 24 hours.  India's Health 
Ministry said Friday the 1,993 new cases and 73 more deaths bring the country's totals to 35,043 with 1,147 deaths.  
The government is due to decide the future of its 40-day lockdown on Sunday. It allowed migrant workers and other 
stranded people to resume their journeys on Wednesday, as well as some shops to reopen and manufacturing and 
farming 
to 
resume.

to Buy Now[1]There are now more than 50 publicly-traded companies operating in the cannabis industry. Most of 
these companies aren't directly growing and selling marijuana themselves, but they do stand to benefit greatly as 
more states legalize the sale and possession of marijuana. Some of these marijuana stocks are media companies. 
Others are privately studying the medical uses of marijuana. Yet others are providing tools and software for 
marijuana growers. As more cannabis companies file IPOs and enter the stock market, it will become increasingly 
difficult for investors to identify which marijuana stocks will truly benefit from the cannabis boom. Our subscribers 
have begun digging through these companies, checking out their financials, business models and long-term growth 
prospects. They know that some "marijuana stocks" are just empty shell companies that deserve to be penny

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-to-axe-up-to-3000-jobs-as-it-warns-recovery-could-take-2-
years/Ryanair is preparing to cut up to 15 per cent of its 19,000 workforce as it becomes the latest airline to warn 
that the aviation industry faces a slow recovery from the upheaval wrought by coronavirus.Europe's largest low-cost 
carrier said it expected it would take at least two years for a return to last year's levels of passenger demand and 
pricing, as it laid out plans to cut further costs. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's outspoken chief executive, said his 
outlook on the recovery had changed over the past week in light of the €9bn bailout Air France-KLM had won from 
the French and Dutch governments, and the state aid Lufthansa is expected to receive. 
He said the 'whole competitive market has now been completely turned on its head'. 'The weakest airlines going 
into the crisis — Lufthansa, Air France, KLM, Alitalia — who were going to in normal circumstances have to 
restructure and retrench are now going to be enormously enriched with this state aid doping.I think what we are 
facing now is that . . . they'll be able to make life very difficult for the well-run airlines like ourselves, BA and 
easyJet.' Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had to respond by downsizing the airline for the next 12 months. 'Unless we have 
materially lower costs for the next 12-24 months, we won't be able to operate successfully in a market where air 
fares are going to be materially lower.' Ryanair intends to axe as many as 3,000 pilot and cabin crew jobs, and 
introduce pay cuts of up to 20 per cent as well as close a number of aircraft bases around Europe until air travel 
recovers. Mr O'Leary will extend his 50 per cent pay cut for the remainder of the financial year to March 2021. He 
said it probably should be considering job cuts of up a third of its workforce, and could not rule out further 
reductions later, but said it was attempting to preserve jobs. Ryanair's comments come as any optimism over a 
speedy recovery for the industry is evaporating, forcing carriers to move from furloughing workers to making 
redundancies. On Tuesday, British Airways revealed plans to axe almost 30 per cent of its 42,000-strong workforce 
after its parent company IAG warned that it could take several years to return to 2019 traffic levels. SAS, the 
Scandinavian airline, said it would permanently cut half — 5,000 — of its staff. Ryanair on Friday said it expected to 
carry no more than 50 per cent of its original traffic target of 44.6m passengers between July and September. For 
the full year, ending March 2021, it is forecasting fewer than 100m passengers — 35 per cent below its original 
target of 154m. In April, May and June, it expects to carry just 150,000 passengers — 99.5 per cent short of its 
previous target of 42.4m passengers. The carrier said it was also reviewing its growth plans and aircraft orders, 
adding that it was in 'active negotiations' with both Boeing and Laudamotion's A320 lessors to cut the number of 
Ryanair to axe up to 3,000 jobs as it warns recovery could take 2 years
planned aircraft deliveries over the next 24 months. The market update comes just a week after Mr O'Leary gave a 
bullish outlook for a recovery in air travel, outlining plans for the airline to resume 80 per cent of flights by 
September, provided that flying in Europe could restart from early July. However, he admitted that these planes 
would have low load factors. On Friday, Mr O'Leary said there was still a chance Ryanair could reach 2019 traffic 
volumes by next summer but said it would take until 2022 for 2019 pricing levels to return. He confirmed Ryanair 
had also filed a legal complaint to the European Commission over its state aid concerns, and said it would launch 
legal action by the end of the month. Read more: Ryanair to axe up to 3,000 jobs as it warns recovery could take 2

According to the news magazine, the government will hold over half of the stake — €5.5 billion — as a silent

on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, 
especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. TOP OF 
THE HOUR: — Virus worries haunt workers demanding rights on May Day. — Japan to extend its state of 
emergency for another month. — Spain field hospital releases its last patients. — French president gives online 
address as protests take place for Labor Day. ___ TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters 
Friday that the coronavirus state of emergency that is supposed to end next week will have to be kept in place 
roughly for another month. Abe, citing a report by experts on a government task force, said Japanese medical 
systems are still under severe pressure with the number of confirmed cases far exceeding 10,000, even though 
Japan has averted explosive infections as in many other countries, and the spread of the infections has somewhat 
slowed under the ongoing state of emergency. 'We still need you to continue cooperating, and that's the experts' 
view,' Abe said. He said he instructed Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is tasked with the coronavirus 
measures, to urgently prepare to extend the measures 'for about a month.' Abe said he will announce details 
Monday. Shigeru Omi, deputy chair of the panel and a public health expert formerly with the World Health 
Organization, told reporters that the infections have not slowed as much as experts had hoped. 'If the resurgence 
occurs, medical systems will be quickly overburdened. Our consensus is that the ongoing framework of measures 
should be maintained,' he said.  Japan has more than 14,000 cases, with over 400 deaths, according to the health 
ministry, though experts say there could be several times more patients. ___ MADRID — Spain is shuttering the 
massive field hospital that that its army helped set up in a Madrid convention center at the height of the coronavirus 
outbreak. The field hospital established inside Madrid's IFEMA convention center released its last patients on 
Friday, as local politicians held a ceremony to close its doors. Nearly 4,000 patients have been treated at the 
IFEMA field hospital. Its installations will be kept intact for weeks in case the virus makes a rebound. Spain has 
nearly 25,000 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 after almost 300 new fatalities were reported on Friday. Spain has 
over 215,000 confirmed coronavirus infections following a daily increase of more than 1,100 cases. The country is 
preparing for its largest rollback of lockdown measures on Saturday when people of all ages will be allowed to leave 
their homes for short walks or exercise for the first time since March 14. The lockdown has succeeded in reducing 
The Latest: Japan to extend state of emergency another month
daily increases of over 20% in cases to under 1%. Over 114,00 Spaniards have been treated for the virus and 
released from care. ___ PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has led the country's Labor Day holiday 
with a message of thanks to workers saving people's lives during the coronavirus crisis. Forgoing his usual 
televised address, Macron tweeted out a pre-recorded speech Friday recognizing that 'the nation is holding on' 
thanks to the life-saving 'dedication of our caregivers, civil defense personnel, law enforcement (and) armies.' 
Macron also thanked the commitment of French farmers and public servants who have enabled many to continue to 
work from home. Labor Day has, since after World War II in France, been an occasion to campaign for and 
celebrate workers' rights. He said 'the spirit of solidarity between workers, has perhaps never been so powerful' as 
now. In sharp contrast, a midday musical protest against Macron's handling of the epidemic is taking place from the 
balconies and widows of confined citizens to the tune of the rebel's anthem Bella Ciao, in the French spirit of 
keeping their leaders in check. CGT Union chief Philippe Martinez raised specific concerns on France Inter radio 
Friday, critiquing plans for some schools to open on May 11 and that teachers could refuse to return to work 'if the 
health of school employees is not ensured, and that of the children.' ___ ROME — As in much of the rest of 
Europe, Italy's May Day traditions, which pay tribute to the role of workers in society, have been upended by 
lockdown rules forbidding gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic.  The heart and soul of Italy's May Day 
commemoration have been rallies led by union leaders, followed by an evening rock and pop music concert in 
Rome, drawing crowds sometimes topping 100,000 in the square outside St. John in Lateran Basilica.  This year, 
musical artists will take turns performing solo in venues without anyone in the audience. Their music will be 
broadcast on TV and by state radio, with the evening's theme being, 'Working in safety to build a future.'  Unions 
have been demanding scrupulous attention to safety measures, including social distancing at work stations and 
assembly lines, hygiene and sanitizing before factories can reopen in Italy, where Europe's devastating outbreak of 
COVID-19 began.  Right-wing political opposition leader Matteo Salvini has accused the center-left government of 
pandering to union demands in being slow to getting the country's economy moving again.  On Monday, some 
lockdown restrictions will begin being eased, with some 3 million Italians expected to return to workplaces, many of 
them in factories. However, some industrial plants have been allowed to operate since lockdown began in early 
March because they produce essential goods. ___ MADRID — Spain's government expects that the Eurozone's 
fourth largest economy will shrink by 9.2% this year and that unemployment will reach 19% of the working-age 
population. Deputy Prime Minister Nadia Calviño announced the grim forecast on Friday when she explained 
Spain's economic stability plan that it has presented to the European Union. This comes a day after Spain's 
government said that the nation's economy had shrunk by 5.2% in the first quarter of 2020, ending 25 consecutive 
quarters of positive economic activity dating back to 2013. Calviño said the government expects the economy to 
rebound strong, with a growth of 6.8% in 2021. Hundreds of thousands of workers have been furloughed since 
Spain applied strict stay-at-home rules on March 14 when it declared a state of emergency that is still in effect. The 
government unveiled this week a complex series of guidelines it will follow to reactivate the economy and social life 
of the country over the coming weeks and months as long as there is not another jump in COVID-19 infections. 
Spain has over 24,000 confirmed deaths from the new virus. ___ ATHENS, Greece — Hundreds of protesters 
gathered in central Athens and the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki to mark May Day, despite appeals from the 
government for May Day marches and commemorations to be postponed until next Saturday, when some lockdown 
measures will have been lifted. Hundreds of members of the Communist Party-backed PAME union gathered in 
both cities Friday morning, wearing masks and gloves and standing two meters apart. The union released photos 
showing organizers using measuring tape and square colored stickers to lay out the exact positions where 
protesters could stand for the rally in central Athens, outside Parliament. This year, May Day is being celebrated 
'under the special, difficult circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic, but with our sight turned to the day after,' 
Communist Party head Dimitris Koutsoumbas said during the rally. The main issue for after the pandemic, he said, 
was the dilemma of 'socialism or barbarity. We answer socialism. A new, fair society is needed, with the working 
classes, the people, truly in power.' Dozens of other unions also planned marches or commemorations, with 
demonstrators generally using masks and maintaining distance from each other. Separately, police were out in 
force Friday to ensure Greeks don't head out to the countryside, a tradition for May Day. Lockdown measures are to 
be eased on Monday, but remain in force for the holiday weekend. Violators face 150 euro fines. ___ 
JOHANNESBURG — A holiday atmosphere enlivened South Africa's streets as the May Day public holiday is also 
when the country has begun easing its strict lockdown.  For the first time in five weeks, people were permitted to 
walk outside for exercise between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., and thousands, with mandated facemasks and keeping 
distance, were out walking through the streets.  Some South Africans will be able to return to work in small batches 
The Latest: Japan to extend state of emergency another month
and many businesses will resume limited operations. Many factories can resume operations in phases, starting with 
only a third of employees allowed to return and must abide by distancing and other guidelines.  Public transport, 
including trains and buses, will begin operating with a restricted number of passengers. Even with the easing, South 
Africa's lockdown remains strict, with no sales of liquor and cigarettes permitted. Ordinarily, South Africa marks May 
Day with rallies by trade unions and political parties, but these are not possible because of the lockdown 
regulations. 'We want to take this opportunity to pay special dedication to our frontline health workers who are 
confronting this virus on daily basis in this difficult time,' said Jacob Khawe, secretary in Johannesburg of the ruling 
African National Congress party. ___ MOSCOW — Russia registered almost 8,000 new coronavirus cases on 
Friday in yet another record daily spike, bringing the total to 114,431. The number of cases is likely to be much 
higher as not everyone gets tested, and tests in Russia were reported to be only 70-80% accurate. In at least five 
Russian regions, health officials registered a surge of pneumonia cases. In Moscow, which accounts for half of all 
virus cases, all respiratory infections are likely to be caused by the coronavirus, according to the public health 
agency Rospotrebnadzor. On Thursday, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced testing positive for 
the new virus and temporarily stepping back from running the Cabinet. ___ COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Danish 
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Friday that 'where we stand now means not everyone can return to work as 
they did before the corona crisis.' The Scandinavian country has slowly reopened by allowing some classes to 
return to school and hairdressers, physiotherapists and tattoo parlors, among others, as well as courts of law to 
reopen. Frederiksen, a Social Democrat, said details of phase two of the reopening of Denmark would be 
announced 'just before May 10.' In neighboring Norway, Jonas Gahr Stoere, head of Norway's Labour Party which 
is the opposition, said in a May Day speech that 'instead of gathering in the squares around the country and proudly 
parade with flags and band music, many of us will sit in front of a screen and follow the May 1 events online.' Gahr 
Stoere said 'we are in the midst of a crisis that is hitting hard and wide.' ___ ATHENS, Greece — Protesters have 
begun gathering in central Athens for traditional May Day marches, despite authorities' pleas to unions to move 
their demonstrations to next week, after lockdown measures begin easing. More than 100 people from the 
communist party-affiliated PAME union gathered in Athens's main Syntagma Square, outside Parliament. Holding 
banners and red flags, and most wearing masks and gloves, the protesters stood roughly two meters (6.5 feet) 
apart from each other as they waited for the march to begin. 'The symbolic events for May Day being organized as 
always by the labor unions, with all necessary protection measures, with them wearing masks and maintaining the 
necessary distance between them, do not constitute a danger for everything the people have won until today by 
adhering to the restrictive measures' of the lockdown, the Communist Party said in an announcement. Greek 
authorities have repeatedly warned people that this year, May Day will have to be different, saying the lockdown 
measures due to be partially lifted starting Monday are still very much in effect. Civil Protection Deputy Minister 
Nikos Hardalias has stressed Greeks will not be able to go on countryside trips as they frequently do, and he 
appealed to trade unions to transfer their usual May Day marches to the first Saturday after lockdown restrictions 
have been eased. 'We welcome May Day with truly spring weather. Like during Easter, we will spend (the day) 
differently,' Hardalias said during his daily briefing Thursday. 'Either at home, or with a walk near it .... I repeat that 
trips far from our permanent residence is not allowed. We are not allowed to go to our country home, certainly not to 
our village.' But unions were to go ahead anyway with more than a dozen marches or commemorations planned, 
especially in central Athens. ___ CANBERRA, Australia — China's warning of trade repercussions from Australia's 
campaign for an independent inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic has rattled Australian business leaders as U.S. 
President Donald Trump's administration urges other governments to back such a probe. China has accused 
Australia of parroting the United States in its call for an inquiry independent of the World Health Organization to 
determine the origins of COVID-19 and how the world responded. Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye used an 
Australian newspaper interview this week to warn that pursuing an inquiry could spark a Chinese consumer boycott. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has defended Australia and urges other countries to demand transparency. 
___ LONDON — Ryanair has announced plans to slash as many as 3,000 jobs and close bases in Europe amid the 
collapse of travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The group announced a restructuring program Friday that 
included plans for unpaid leave and pay cuts of as much as 20%. The budget airline says will operate less than 1%

https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak5 Oil Stocks That May Not Survive the Current Crisis[1]What would 
you think of the long-term prospects of a business that paid you to buy their products? That's an oversimplification 
of what occurred to the May futures contract for oil on April 20. The price for that contract sold for a negative price 
for the first time in history. The crisis befalling the oil companies at this time can best be described as 'only the 
strongest survive.' There's just no way the oil companies can possibly handle month after month of rock-bottom oil 
prices. The problem is almost comically simple to understand. There is a massively reduced demand for oil as 
millions of Americans are following mitigation orders ranging from social distancing guidelines to more restrictive 
shelter in place orders. At the same time, the market is trying to absorb the oversupply of oil that came from Russia 
and Saudi Arabia. However, when the year started, things looked like it might be business as usual for oil 
producers. The U.S. economy was humming along and there was talk that the second half of the year might finally 
bring the boost to oil prices that many companies badly needed. However, since the middle of February, the bottom 
has dropped out of the market in general, and oil prices have been one of the main sectors to feel the impact. 
Initially, investors tried to remain optimistic. A month ago, investors thought that the economy might be reopening 
sooner rather than later. However, the exact timing of the reopening is about as fluid as a barrel of oil. And with it 
looking more likely that there will be more demand destruction at least through May, there's very little to prop up the 
stock of any oil companies. And that means that, in all likelihood, there will not be room left for some oil companies. 
We've highlighted five oil stocks that have a strong probability of not surviving the chaos surrounding the 
coronavirus and our nation's response. View the "5 Oil Stocks That May Not Survive the Current Crisis"[2]. [ 1]:

Apr 30, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Air travel 
is bound to look fundamentally different from the times before the coronavirus crisis. Changes will be visible at the 
airport and in the cabin, as Andreas Spaeth reports.Michael O'Leary is against it. "If they do that, we're not returning 
to flying at all," the Ryanair chief executive recently announced defiantly. There is already an intense discussion on 
how passenger air travel can be resumed once the sweeping restrictions to contain the coronavirus are lifted. 
One of the key questions is: should middle seats on aircraft be left vacant?"The middle seat doesn't deliver any 
social distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't deliver anything anyway," O'Leary told the Financial 
Times. If such a regulation were to be imposed by Ryanair's home country, Ireland, then "either the government 
pays for the middle seat or we won't fly."One thing seems to be clear: There is no easy return to the world as we 
knew it in aviation before the coronavirus, likely none at all.Business models in jeopardyThis threatens the business 
model of an airline like Ryanair, which is known to squeeze in as many passengers as possible and keeps its 
aircraft on the ground for only short turnarounds before sending them up again, allowing it to fly more than others. 
This model might be fundamentally thrown into doubt with the now required regular, thorough cleaning of aircraft 
and lengthier boarding procedures to keep passengers apart from each other, which would inevitably increase 
ground times.So far, there's been no evidence of any infections on board aircraft. The aviation industry keeps 
stressing that cabin air is at least as clean as the air in operation theaters, thanks to high-performance air particle 
filters. The risks are further mitigated by the cabin air streaming downward. It hasn't also been proven that vacant 
middle seats lower the risk of infection. Still, many airlines like Lufthansa Group, including Eurowings, currently 
block middle seats. Likewise, easyJet is promising travel without a direct seat neighbor at least initially once it 
restarts operations."It's purely a cosmetic measure and there is no scientific justification that it would help," says 
Shashank Nigam, CEO of aviation consultancy Simpliflying. But psychology does play a role currently. "We will 
continue to enable a safe travel experience that has to become visible for the passenger to build up trust," promises 
Ingo Wuggetzer, vice president of Cabin Marketing at Airbus.Far-reaching changes aheadSimpliflying paints a 
sobering picture of how air travel might look like in the age of sanitized travel. "The changes will be as far-reaching, 
if not more so, than the ones introduced after 9/11, and will be here with us to stay," claims Nigam."In addition to 
security checks, you will have a sanitation element added on top." In a recent report, Simpliflying says a journey by 
air will roughly look somewhat like this: As part of the online check-in process, passengers will be required to 
upload an immunity passport confirming the presence of antibodies for COVID-19. At the airport itself, travelers will 
be required to arrive at least four hours before departure.Even before passengers can enter the actual check-in 
area, they will have to pass through a disinfection tunnel and thermal scanners. A newly founded Transport Health 
Post-corona air travel: Flying under the plexiglass hood
Authority, similar to the TSA created in the US after 9/11, could define standards in cooperation with the World 
Health Organization and airport and airline groups."We have to get our act together to implement similar measures 
all over the world that the traveling public understands," demands Christoph Müller, an airline veteran and former 
CEO of Aer Lingus and Malaysia Airlines, among others. "We need a kind of safety net, there's nothing worse than 
people not getting on board for fear of getting infected," says Müller.But if the regulations laid out by Simplifying 
become a reality, they may also put off many from using air travel in the future.Flying no fun anymore?In addition to 
new regulations expected to be introduced by many countries, it will become mandatory to wear masks while flying. 
This is also suggested by the German airline lobby BDL in its concept paper on restarting air travel.It pledges to 
make sure that during boarding, flight and deplaning, every passenger wears a mask. It also talks about an 
obligation for passengers to bring their own masks. In Canada, this regulation already exists; in the US, JetBlue has 
become the first airline to impose it on passengers.Lufthansa passengers are to be compelled to wear a mask 
covering the nose and mouth and to be requested to keep them on throughout the flight, with the new measure 
going into force on May 4. The airline said it planned to require the wearing of masks on all the airlines in the group 
at least until August 31. In the future, all checked bags as well as cabin bags will go through a UV disinfection 
process to be "sanitagged," as the authors call the hygiene approval, which would include other health checks as 
well. Gone are the times of mad dashes straight to security and to the gate. Soon, it might be inevitable to be at the 
checkpoint two hours before departure.The actual boarding would take place in small groups keeping in mind social 
distancing norms, with the jet bridge potentially serving as another disinfection tunnel. On board, many things are 
likely to change, starting with the seats. For the first time, seat manufacturers have now revealed their designs for 
the post-corona era.Aviointeriors from Italy is promoting its "Glassafe" design featuring plexiglass hoods in the 
shoulder and head sections of every seat, reminiscent of old telephone booths. The more elaborate "Janus" seat, 
named after the two-faced Roman god, features a middle seat turned 180 and facing the rear of the aircraft, fenced 
off from its neighbors by plexiglass walls."A hygiene divider could be an intelligent combination of the requirements 
of comfort/privacy and hygiene/distance," says Ingo Wuggetzer of Airbus.No sales yetSo far no airline has ordered 
such post-corona cabin furnishing. Asian company Haeco is taking a pragmatic approach in proposing to alternate 
seat rows with rows of stored cargo in the cabin. This would not only create more distancing but also provide better 
aircraft loads at times like now, when demand for cargo capacity is bigger than for seats.In any case, passenger 
experience will soon be very different: Cabin crews will wear protective clothing, the passengers will wear gloves 
and masks, with the cabin being fogged for disinfection before departure and the crew offering hand sanitizer every 
half hour, while in Business and First Class, only packaged and sealed meals will be distributed.Dedicated inflight 
janitors will ensure cleanliness of toilets and galleys throughout the entire flight. After landing, the immunity passport 
will be verified again and one has to pass through a thermal scanner, bags will be "sanitagged" again before being 
placed on the conveyor belt. Like this, flying probably won't be much fun anymore for many."Depending on time and 
availability of a vaccine, some elements will be kept, others will disappear," predicts Ingo Wuggetzer.

Apr 30, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Delta 
Air Lines DAL[1] initiated the first-quarter 2020 earnings season for the airline stocks. The carrier incurred a loss as 
the coronavirus-led weak air-travel demand resulted in an 18.2% fall in passenger revenues.Similarly, Southwest 
Airlines LUV[2] suffered itsfirst quarterly loss in almost a decade[3]with passenger revenues dropping 19% in the 
first quarter. Moreover, Copa Holdings CPA[4] came out with lackluster preliminary first-quarter results. Detailed 
results are scheduled to be out on May 6.Further, due to coronavirus-related weakness in passenger revenues, 
United Airlines UAL[5] reported bleak preliminary results in the previous week[6].Highlights of the Past Week's Top 
Stories1. Delta incurred a loss (excluding 33 cents from non-recurring items) of 51 cents for the March quarter, 
narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 72 cents. 
However, the bottom line came in against the year-ago quarter's reported earnings of 96 cents per share (on an 
adjusted basis). With Delta making significant capacity cuts to match the coronavirus-induced sharp decrease in 
traffic, capacity (measured in available seat miles) contracted 5.7% to 58.88 billion. With the decline in traffic (down 
16.6%) outpacing the capacity reduction, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was down 960 basis 
points to 73.1%[7].2. Southwest Airlines posted a loss of 15 cents per share (excluding 3 cents from non-recurring 
items) in the first quarter of 2020, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents. In the year-ago period, 
the company delivered earnings of 70 cents per share. The results reflect the coronavirus-induced plunge in 
passenger demand. Meanwhile, operating revenues of $4,234 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$4,397 million. Additionally, the top line declined 17.8% year over year[8].3. Copa Holdings expects total revenues 
of $595.5 million for the quarter, indicating a decline of 11.4% from the year-ago reported figure. Also, operating 
profit is projected at $98.7 million with an operating margin of 16.6%[9].4. Ryanair's RYAAY[10] CEO Michael 
O'Leary warned of job cuts if flights remain suspended post May due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. As of 
now, management assured all its employees of no pay cut for April and May. Per a Reuters report[11], he said that 
the carrier may have to lay off 10-20% of its workforce in winter.5.In a bid to break the chain of coronavirus, JetBlue 
Airways JBLU[12] announced a new policy for flying. Per the policy, passengers flying with this Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold) low-cost carrier will require to wear a mask to cover their nose and mouth throughout their entire journey. 
American Airlines AAL[13] too aims to provide face masks to its passengers from May 1 onward.You can seethe

Images Alt Text Coronavirus airports  EU planning future rules amid debate over social distancing on flights 
Reaction[1] Wednesday, April 29, 2020 - 10:53am European transport ministers are meeting today to discuss what 
airlines will need to do for international travel to resume. Several nations on the Continent have begun to relax their 
coronavirus lockdown measures[2], but the airline industry has already taken a battering. See related Richard 
Branson in race to save Virgin Atlantic[3] Will plane fares double after coronavirus crisis? [4] Airlines in crisis: 
coronavirus bites hard[5] The UK Foreign Office is currently advising British nationals against 'all but essential 
international travel', with the vast majority of flights grounded across the globe. 
British Airways this week set out plans to make up to 12,000 of itsstaff redundant, and several other airlines are on 
the brink of collapse[6]. BA's parent company, IAG,has warned that a return to 2019 passenger levels is likely to 
take 'several years'. So will air travel ever look the same again?SpacingAsForbes[7] reports, there is 'an active 
debate within the industry about whether spacing out passengers, as has been done on public transport, would 
work in planes'. Airlines including Lufthansa and easyJet have pledged to keep more seats free - such as the 
middle seats - as a temporary social distancing measure. However, lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E) has said 
social distancing is not 'viable on board an aircraft'. In a letter to EU ministers, the Brussels-based organisation 
argued that it would be impossible for passengers and crew to maintain a two-metre distance from each another 
and that it would not be financially viable for any airline to fly a plane that was only two-thirds full. Ryanair boss 
MichaelO'Leary echoed those concerns in an interview last week with theFinancial Times[8]. 'We can't make money 
on 66% load factors,' O'Leary said.'Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn't deliver any social distancing, so it's 
kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway.'Best practiceThe European Aviation Safety Agency 
(EASA) is drawing up safety guidelines for the industry - and 'in the meantime, airports are working on their own 
best practices that require changes in disinfection routines, installing coronavirus testing facilities and temperature 
checks, and reorganising gates to ensure space between people', Politico[9]reports. The Italian government also 
set out rules this week for mandatory masks and one-way corridors in airports to prevent over-crowding. Conde 
Nast Traveller[10] suggests that airports may also introduce 'far more automation - from DIY check-ins and bag 
drops to robotic cleaners', and that 'immunity passports' may enter into widespread use. 'Travelling will feel 
intimidating - people will be on high alert,' says the magazine. 'It's been suggested that coronavirus is the new 
terrorism. But after months of confinement, it will also feel incredibly freeing to be on the move again.' -#8212;-

might be some good deals for travel this autumn, the promotions are unlikely to last as airlines seek to cover their

airlines that have laid off thousands of employees and cut ties to many contractors.'  World News[14] Travel[15]

 Ryanair (RYA.L) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary criticized Sir Richard Branson for attempting to claim 
state aid to help Virgin Atlantic survive the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, media reports said over the weekend. 
O'Leary attacked Branson for asking British taxpayers to fund a 500 million pounds sterling ($620 million) bailout, 
and claimed Branson has enough money to "bail himself out."
In an open letter to Virgin employees last Tuesday, Branson said he was asking the government for a 500 million 
pound commercial loan, specifying that it would not be handout and would be paid back. 
Media reports said that Virgin Atlantic hired an investment bank in an effort to find investors that would inject 
emergency funds into the airline and avert a collapse into administration. 
Virgin Atlantic is 51% owned by Branson's Virgin Group and 49% owned by Delta Air Lines.

page has been deleted. The airline with the largest European market share has its share of Achilles' heelsWith oil 
prices so low, this would be a great time to own an airline—if anyone wanted to fly. That's the case for Ryanair 
Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:RYAAY[1]), the low-cost airline with the biggest market share in Europe and the United 
Kingdom. 
This Dublin, Ireland-based carrier finds itself on the Undervalued Predictable list at GuruFocus in part because a 
lack of demand for air travel has pushed down its share price, and because it has a strong earnings history. 
Presumably, those earnings will continue to enrich shareholders once the current crisis has abated, or will they? 
Does the company have the resources and management strength to survive an unexpected down cycle? Let's start 
with a look at the share price over the past 10 years:After making a nice recovery coming out of the 2008 financial 
crisis, Ryanair began losing altitude in 2018. Why? Apparently, there was no shortage of problems[2], including 
some that were self-inflicted: Higher fuel costs. Rising wages; in December 2017, the company recognized a pilot's 
union and began increasing their wages. That drove labor costs up 34% in the second quarter of 2018. Strikes by 
regional air traffic controllers that caused it to cancel more than 2,500 flights in the first quarter of 2018. Ryanair 
refused to provide cash compensation to passengers and got even more criticism from its customers and the public. 
It is a company with an appalling customer service history. The BBC reported [3]in January 2019 that Ryanair had 
been named the United Kingdom's 'worst short-haul airline' for the sixth year running. Passengers did not like its 
boarding processes, its seat comfort, its food and drink offerings or the cabin environment. Making matters worse is 
a CEO, Michael O'Leary, who seems to delight in provoking controversy, perhaps in the belief that even bad 
publicity is good publicity. At one time, perhaps thinking out loud, he speculated that the airline might begin 
charging passengers for using plane toilets, an idea that brought on a critical backlash, and one from which O'Leary 
promptly retreated. Despite all that negative news, passengers throughout Europe keep flocking to the airline. In 
response to the polling that found it to be the worst airline for six years in a row, the company claimed its passenger 
numbers had increased by 80% in those same six years. The BBC also quoted an airline consultant as saying, 'the 
airline had endured a 'tough year' but still generates 'huge amounts of cash.'" Not long afterward, free cash flow 
dropped off significantly, as shown in this 10-year chart:For a broader test of Ryanair's quantitative worth, we will 
examine it using the lens of the Macpherson model, a set of criteria used by Thomas Macpherson, the manager of 
Ryanair Holdings : Surprising Positives, but Also Serious Concerns
Nintai Investments and a contributor to GuruFocus. It tests for a moat, financial strength, profitability and a 
discounted share price. Moat To test for a competitive advantage, which leads to strong, sustainable margins and 
higher earnings, the model tests for a median 10-year return of 15% on capital and tangible equity. Return on 
capital: median is 22.67%, well above the 15% required. Return on tangible equity: again, the median is above 
15%, at 18.41%. The ROC for 2019 was 17.17%, below the 10-year average, and more than triple the company's 
weighted average cost of capital at 5.27%. We should note here that enjoying a competitive advantage, which 
Ryanair does, is quite remarkable given the intensity of competition in the airline industry. Financial strength Like 
most companies that use leverage, Ryanair gets a fail on both criteria for financial strength; a cash-to-debt ratio of 
at least 100 and a GuruFocus financial strength rating of at least 9 out of 10:Still, it is no danger of going bankrupt; 
as the table shows, its interest coverage ratio is more than 22 times. Regarding interest coverage[4], GuruFocus 
explained: 'Ben Graham requires that a company has minimum interest coverage of 5 with the companies he 
invested. If the interest coverage is less than 2, the company is burdened by debt.' Profitability With a strong moat, 
Ryanair posts strong earnings and high profitability:As noted in the moat section, high profitability is a surprise for a 
player in the airline industry, which is better known for destroying capital. As with Southwest Airlines 
(NYSE:LUV[5]), there is profitability in keeping costs down for customers. Valuation An examination of Ryanair's 
discounted cash flow points us to a seeming contradiction. When we bring up the DCF, we see it does not have a 
margin of safety (in fact, it has a small, negative margin) because the valuation is below the market price:What we 
see here is the earnings-based DCF. But GuruFocus also offers a free cash flow-based DCF and the latter appears 
to determine whether a stock makes it through the Undervalued Predictable screener. For Ryanair, the free cash 
flow-based valuation is $81, a fair or intrinsic value that is well above the market price of $56.78. By that measure, 
Ryanair does belong on the screener list. Overall, the airline passed tests for a moat and profitability but failed on 
financial strength and valuation. Ownership Eleven of the gurus followed by GuruFocus have holdings in Ryanair. 
David Herro[6] (Trades[7], Portfolio[8]) of the Oakmark International Fund has the largest holding, with nearly 11 
million shares at the end of 2019. Sarah Ketterer[9] (Trades[10], Portfolio[11]) of Causeway Capital Management 
and Jim Simons[12] (Trades[13], Portfolio[14]) of Renaissance Technologies also held more than a million shares 
each. In his letter to Oakmark shareholders[15] published Jan. 9, Herro was optimistic about the company's longer-
term prospects. While his remarks were published before passengers stopped flying, his thoughts are encouraging 
for the longer term. Institutional investors owned 26% of the company's outstanding shares at the end of the first 
quarter, while its filings show no insider investments. Covid-19 response On April 3, Ryanair released a statement 
explaining that 99% of its flights had been canceled and withdrew its guidance for 2020. It also noted, 'Ryanair has 
one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, with year-end cash equivalents of €3.8bn and 327 (77%) of the 
Group's owned fleet unencumbered and debt free. The Ryanair Group has already implemented a series of 
measures to cut operating costs, improve liquidity and cash flows.' Conclusion Ryanair is something of a round peg 
in a square hole, an airline that usually makes money rather than blowing it up. I was surprised to find a major 
airline with a serious competitive advantage. Yet, it's also a company with some issues, including its current share 
price that provides a negative margin of safety. And, with an airline that has an uncertain future, investors would 
certainly want a meaningful margin of safety. This article is only an introduction to the company and investors must 
do their own due diligence. I do not own shares in it and do not expect to buy any in the next 72 hours. Read more

? More than 80 publicly listed companies used the US Treasury's $350bn bailout fund for keeping small businesses 
afloat during the economic shutdown amid an intensifying debate about which groups should get access to the 
money. FT analysis found that some companies using the Paycheck Protection Program have also raised money in 
the public markets despite the coronavirus lockdowns.
? A potential coronavirus drug from USbased Gilead Sciences flopped in its first randomised clinical trial. 
Documents published accidentally by the World Health Organization said a China trial did not reduce the pathogen 
in the blood. Gilead said the post included "inappropriate characterisations of the study".
?Walt Disney stopped paying more than 100,000 employees this week as it tries to weather the lockdown. 
Suspending pay for thousands of so-called cast members will save the group up to $500m a month.
? Elliott Management was fined (EURO)20m by the French markets regulator for obstructing an investigation into a 
takeover bid and not adequately disclosing its positions. The Autorité des Marchés Financiers said it had fined the 
activist hedge fund over "inaccurate and late reports" filed in connection with a tender offer in 2015 by XPO logistics 
for Norbert Dentressangle, a French logistics group.
? Coronavirus is hitting personal grooming, according to consumer goods group Unilever. People are washing their 
hair less, putting off shaving and even abandoning deodorant, the Anglo-Dutch company said as it reported flat 
underlying sales growth in the first quarter, down from 3.1 per cent a year earlier.
Bailout fund tapped BEST OF BUSINESS
? A 40-year-old Qatari businessman was revealed to be the new owner of London's Ritz Hotel. Official filings show 
the buyer is Abdulhadi Mana Al-Hajri, brother of Sheikha Al-Anoud, the second wife of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al 
Thani, emir of Qatar.
? Lufthansa warned it will run out of cash within weeks if it does not receive assistance from European 
governments. The German airline reported losses of about (EURO)1.2bn for the first three months of 2020, and 
said it expected that to widen in the next quarter.
? Netflix added more than twice as many subscribers as it had forecast in the first three months of the 100,000 
'Cast member' staff that Walt Disney stopped paying this week 15.8m Subscribers added by Netflix in the first three 
months of 2020 year. The video streaming service added 15.8m subscribers in the three months ending in March.
? Investors urged drugmakers to collaborate on developing a coronavirus vaccine. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments 
and sister company Fidelity International, Aviva Investors, Janus Henderson and Amundi, said they want drug 
companies to put aside any qualms about collaborating with rivals.
?Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary warned the low-cost airline would not return to flying if governments insist 
planes leave their middle seats empty when travel restrictions are lifted.
? Canada Goose, the upmarket parka brand, pledged to stop using virgin fur by 2022, in a move that it says is part 
of a drive for sustainability.

Confusion reigns as card issuers, airlines face $35b refund tidal wave
Confusion reigns as card issuers, airlines face $35b refund tidal wave

Highlight: Credit card and airline companies are reeling from an unprecedented $35bn in refunds for covid-19 
tickets cancellations, causing bewilderment among frustrated customers.
Body
Many airlines are pushing back on customers' demand for refund, claiming they have yet to receive the required 
cash from the credit card companies that process airline payments. Governments in the US and EU have reaffirmed 
travellers' right to get their money back. At the same time, the beleaguered airline industry is appealing to 
governments to approve airlines issuing credit vouchers for future flights in place of cash refunds. 
Meanwhile, an open-ended warning against travel has holidaymakers unsure what to do about existing bookings, 
while evolving airline refund policies have left many travel advisors all at sea. "The airlines want to make sure they 
do the right things for their customers, but they also want to make sure they have the cash to survive," said Peter 
Vlitas, senior vice president of airlines for Travel Leaders Group. Settlement issues The airline industry has never 
had it so bad. Not even after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The $35b liability for tickets sold but not flown, combined with 
airlines' fixed costs, is expected to result in a $61 billion cash outflow for the world's airlines in the second quarter of 
this year. The delay in credit card settlements "is severely constricting their cash flow to the point of threatening the 
continuation of their operations, as evidenced in past airline bankruptcies," said Chris Goater, assistant director, 
Corporate Communications at the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Goater added that a number of 
airlines have already suffered financial distress and even gone bankrupt due to the extended cash holds that credit 
card banks place on their sales. The settlement terms depend on the level of confidence that credit card companies 
have in the long-term survival of an airline, but they can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If an airline gets into trouble, 
and has no access to the bulk of capital generated by its sales, then it will fail. Customers caught in the middle Even 
when holidays are cancelled, many travel companies are refusing to issue refunds, insisting customers rebook their 
trip or accept vouchers instead. Some other operators are not cancelling trips until two weeks before the departure 
date. Companies including TUI, Love Holidays and Virgin Holidays are issuing credit notes for cancelled bookings 
in the first instance, even when customers have asked for a cash refund. Ryanair is doing the same. However, 
these vouchers may not be financially protected by Atol. That means holidaymakers risk losing their money if their 
firm goes bust before they are able to take their holiday. Some customers have resorted to asking their card

provider to help get their money back, while those still paying deposit installments on holidays for this summer are 
wondering what to do. Many passengers have been left holding expensive onwards flights, hotel, and other holiday 
bookings that they will not be able to cancel. In many cases, they can consider that money lost.

Apr 24, 2020( The Week UK: http://www.theweek.co.uk Delivered by Newstex)  Your guide to the best columns and 
commentary on Friday 24 April Analysis[1] Friday, April 24, 2020 - 2:45pm The Week's daily round-up highlights the 
five best opinion pieces from across the British and international media, with excerpts from each.1. Finn 
McRedmond in The Irish Timeson turning a blind eye to bad corporate behaviourRyanair is being mean again but 
we don't really care[2]'There is little moral equivalence between Ryanair being slow to offer refunds and 
[Wetherspoons chairman Tim] Martin's callous treatment of his already poorly paid staff. But for both companies, 
their value is not rooted in whether we perceive them to be good or bad moral actors but in the far simpler fact that 
they are cheap, accessible and largely democratising forces in their industries.It is, too, much easier for the average 
consumer to boycott a company when we can switch to another with no financial cost, and without forsaking 
convenience. There aren't plenty of alternatives to Ryanair; and Wetherspoon's entire raison d'etre is that you'll get 
much more bang for you buck than at an independent local.'2. Jonathan Bernstein on Bloombergon a darker 
revelation behind the laughsTrump's disinfectant idea is more than a silly soundbite[3] See related Trump suggests 
disinfectant cure for coronavirus - five other weird ideas from world leaders[4] 'All presidents enter the White House 
with significant gaps in their knowledge of public policy. 
Every modern one has worked reasonably hard or very hard to catch up. Trump by all accounts (including his own) 
instead watches hours of cable news every day. As I've said, there's nothing wrong with presidents monitoring the 
media, even though they have much better sources of information. It's a good way to get outside the White House 
bubble and understand what other people are hearing. But Trump appears to use cable news as a substitute, not a 
supplement, to basic briefings.' -#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-

242. Goodbye to the Oslo Agreement. Goodbye to the two-state solution, to 'road maps' and EU initiatives, to all the 
'peace plans' of Tony Blair - remember him? - and especially goodbye to decades of US presidential appeals to 
Israel for 'restraint'.'4. Diana Spechler in the New York Timeson the line between art and pornographyThe nude 
selfie is now high art[8]'Though the debate about art versus pornography has never been settled, a case can be 
made that quarantine nude selfies are art. Some of us finally have time to make art, and this is the art we are 
making: carefully posed, cast in shadows, expertly filtered. These aren't garish below-the-belt shots under 
fluorescent lighting, a half-used roll of toilet paper in the background. They are solicited or spontaneous. They are 
gifts to partners in separate quarantines, friends who aren't exactly friends, unmet Hinge matches and exes. (Exes 
are popping up like Wack-a-Moles these days.)'5. Valentine Low in The Timeson an acrimonious breakupHow 
Harry and Meghan ran out of patience with the press[9]'The case is eagerly awaited by those same tabloids: not 
just for the result, which will directly affect them, but for the opportunities it is likely to provide for courtroom drama. 
Thomas Markle has signalled that he is prepared to give evidence against his daughter: in turn the duchess has

wealth' means she has forfeited a right to privacy.'  Opinion[10] UK News[11] Europe[12] US[13] Russia[14]

Ryanair may have to lay off 10-20% of staff in the winter season as it will operate fewer flights due to the 
coronavirus crisis, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a newspaper interview published on Friday.
Citing an expected drop in flights by 20-30% in the winter schedule, O'Leary told German business daily 
Handelsblatt that fewer staff would be required.
"I think that job reductions by 10-20% in winter are almost inevitable," he said. "Passengers will return, but it will 
take time."
There could also be a second wave of worldwide infections, he said.
When lockdowns end, airports and planes will have to ensure rules on social distancing and protective gear. 
O'Leary has backed anti-virus measures but rejected calls for planes to fly one-third empty. (Reuters)

Apr 24, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Porsche Porsche is 
introducing new, tech-packed infotainment systems that owners can swap into their classic cars. The new "Porsche 
Classic Communication Management" systems allow owners of classic Porsches to have modern conveniences like 
Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, USB ports, and touchscreens. The two new systems are compatible with Porsche 
models ranging from the 1960s to the 2000s. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. The market for 
classic Porsches is perhaps hotter than ever, with prices of vintage 911s, 928s, and even 944s skyrocketing in 
recent years. 
But the company is betting that even fans of its older models will appreciate some modern touches. Porsche is 
introducing a pair of new infotainment systems[2] that will allow owners of Porsches from the 1960s to the early 
2000s to retrofit their cars with modern tech features like a touchscreen, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, an SD-card slot, 
and USB ports. The new head units, called "Porsche Classic Communication Management," also receive digital 
radio stations. Owners of older cars are alwaysable to swap out the factory head unit in their car for an aftermarket 
infotainment system, but Porsche's newly available systems sport the company's logo and blend seamlessly into 
older dashboards, the company said. One PCCM[3] version — compatible with Porsches from the 1960s through 
the early 1990s — has rotary knobs, push buttons, and a modest, 3.5-inch touchscreen display. The PCCM Plus[4] 
option, built for newer models from 1997 to 2005, comes with a seven-inch touchscreen. At current exchange rates, 
the new infotainment systems will run you roughly $1,550 for the standard version and $1,730 for the Plus 
option.NOW WATCH: How waste is dealt with on the world's largest cruise ship[5]See Also: The CEO of Ryanair,

Stapleton Airlines aren't used to losing money. For years, the core group of US airlines raked in hundreds of 
millions of dollars in pure profit, which they spent freely on stock buybacks and service expansions. American 
Airlines, the largest domestic carrier, for instance, saw profits increase from $690 million in 2012 to $2.179 billion in 
2019. That is, until it all came crashing down.[1] Delta was the first airline to report its first quarter earnings this 
week[2], and things aren't looking good. It expects to lose $534 million for the three-month period, of which only the 
latter half was fully affected by the absolute plunge in travel. 
The other airlines are set to report in the coming week — but don't expect things to get much better. United forecast 
in a surprise release that it would likely lose $2.1 billion[3] for the quarter as revenues fall 90%. So when will things 
get better? Your guess is as good as mine. As it stands now, nearly three quarters of Americans say they won't fly 
for at least four months, according to a Fortune-SurveyMonkey poll. Adios, summer vacation plans (Don't forget,

View original post here[2]. Submitted by Michael Every of Rabobank  Suspicious Minds  It is perhaps the oldest 
Middle East oil trick in the book: you want higher oil prices, threaten to start breaking things. Yesterday US 
President Trump gave an order authorizing the navy to use 'overwhelming lethal force' against any Iranian gunboats 
which harass American ships - and up popped oil. Of course, it probably won't last long given supply-demand 
imbalances and the fact that Iran will now just switch to another way to harass and annoy the US in the region (of 
which it has many); and surely even the most suspicious of minds must concede that starting a war with Iran is 
pretty low on Trump's to-do list going into the 2020 election? As such, the ripple effects from lower oil prices are 
going to continue to be felt in both some obvious and some unusual places. 
For example, one would think China is a big winner from this oil-price war - yet Caixin is reporting that the Bank of 
China sold the May oil contract to wealthy retail investors using fund names like 'crude oil treasure', who 
subsequently got absolutely crushed.  Jailhouse Rock  The UK government still can't find masks. It still can't tell us 
to wear masks. It still can't do mass testing. But what it can do is tell the public what should have been obvious from 
the start: that social distancing measures will have to stay in place for the rest of the year in order to control COVID-
19. We have made clear previously what the implications of this are: you stop a lockdown and yet you don't go back 
to normal.  Please explain the functional business model of a restaurant already running on tight margins when 
customer turnover needs to be reduced by 50% to allow safe 2-meter gaps between tables, and where everyone is 
sitting there enjoying the food and drink and ambience in a mask. Imagine what the meal will have to cost to make a 
profit for the poor restaurateur; and imagine if subsequently the air-conditioning has to be turned off too given there 
is evidence that this also spreads the virus.  Need another simple example? RyanAir has announced that it won't be 
flying again with 'idiotic' social distancing rules, according to its CEO, which he proposes as middle seats being left 
empty when surely the 2-metre logic should be only 3-4 people per row, and two rows empty between each 
occupied one? On the more prudent basis an economy class ticket will surely be closer to business class fares - in 
which case the potential number of people willing and able to fly is going to be even lower than projected (an 
exponential/fat tail effect where less means less, just as more can mean more).  Likewise, Australia is now going to 
keep its international borders closed for another three to four months at least, even as local lockdowns are partially 
eased - so no international tourism until August at the very earliest. If anyone can afford to fly there when the skies 
do open again.  Of course, the US is also closing down to immigration for 60 days (except it isn't: there are visa 
Rabobank : You Can Stop The Lockdown But You Won't Go Back To Normal
loopholes as big as the gaps in Trump's Wall) even as it is seeing some states boldly reopenand Trump is suddenly 
hedging his bets by allowing governors to reopen while being publicly opposed in the case of Georgia. Heads he 
wins, tails he doesn't lose. We shall see within weeks if this action means the economy picks up or virus infections 
do..  Heartbreak Hotel  Consequently, even as Australia saw its services PMI at just 19.6(!) and as Japan recorded 
the worst manufacturing PMI since 2009 at 43.7 and the worst services PMI ever at 22.8, consider that for the 
services sector on which so much of the modern global economy is built, normal service is not anywhere close to 
being resumed. Other global PMIs follow today and are expected to see Eurozone manufacturing at 38.0, down 
from 44.5, and services also at 22.8, down from 26.4, while the UK consensus is for 42.0 and 27.8, respectively, 
and for the US 35.0 and 30.0 - making the US a relative outperformer.  Meanwhile, today we will all be looking at 
the US initial claims data to see if another 4.5 million people lose their jobs, taking the total to 26.5 million in five 
weeks, or if it's slightly better or worse than that.  A Little Less Conversation  Today also has a 'make or break' 
European meeting on what to do to save the economy and, according to the French and Portuguese leaders, the 
EU and Euro too. Yesterday saw the ECB set some limits when it prudently underlined that it is not allowed to buy 
government securities directly, as this is illegal, and that 'helicopter money' would also be problematic for it; this is 
the same ECB that is literally begging governments to spend vastly more so it has bonds to buy in the secondary 
market (which is not just legal, but standard policy) and which is now about to buy corporate junk-bonds too. 
(Rather ironically, yesterday saw data show that Eurozone debt-to-GDP in 2019 dropped from 85.8% to 84.1%)  But 
back to the politicians. By videoconference (underlining the lost service-sector revenue to a hotel and caterer 
somewhere) a temporary EUR300bn recovery fund is being discussed along with a EUR200bn recovery and 
resilience facility, EUR50bn in repurposed cohesion funds, and two EUR200bn funds 'to protect the EU's internal 
markets'. And that appears to be it, even though somehow this is EUR 2trn in some headlines. Italy, which 
yesterday announced that its fiscal deficit will be 10% of GDP in 2020 even though there is precious little stimulus 
taking place is, according to a report in the FT, now willing to avoid the debt mutualisation issue and instead favour 
ultra-long maturity or perpetual bond issuance. One wonders how the Usual Suspects in northern Europe will feel 
about that compromise. Is the numeric response still 999?  I won't allow myself to get sucked into the classic Euro 
game of mind-stultifying fudge, acronyms, and deck-chair rearranging. Instead, I will quote Bloomberg directly: 'The 
'roadmap' EU Council President Charles Michel distributed to national delegations ahead of the video conference 
contained no details on the amount, the specific objectives, the time frame or the nature of the investment needed 
to get the bloc back on track. Leaders aren't expected to reach a decision this week and a final package may not be 
ready for at least six months, according to a French official.'  SIX MONTHS?! And then action on a scale that looks 
completely out of kilter with the economic damage being wrought. Euro-committees are all very fine and good, and I 
am always told they work best when in a genuine crisis (or only in a crisis) - but where is The King when you need 
him? 
He 
appears 
to 
have 
left 
the 
building.

Ryanair must be clearer about full ticket price warns EU court

Ryanair must indicate the full price of the ticket when it displays offers on its website, the EU's top court said on 
Thursday.
The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) made its ruling after the Italian antitrust authority (AGCM) 
criticized Ryanair in 2011 for prices that did not include value-added tax on domestic flights and fees for check-in 
and payments by credit card.
The AGCM argued these were unavoidable and should be indicated before a customer began the booking process. 
Ryanair took the matter to court, prompting Italy's Council of State to ask the CJEU whether the price elements 
needed to be included.
The judges in Luxembourg said Ryanair had to show in its initial offer unavoidable and foreseeable taxes, 
surcharges and fees. Optional price supplements could be left until the start of the booking process, they said.
They found that fees for using a credit card were unavoidable and should be shown in the initial offer.
Check-in fees also needed to be shown unless there was at least one option to check in free of charge.
Value-added tax applied to the air fare should also be included, although did not have to be included for optional 
supplements, the judges said.
In  a statement today, Ryanair said, “Ryanair’s price display policy is fully transparent and already complies with the 
CJEU ruling. The matter goes back to 2010 and our price display has since been adjusted.” (Reuters)

Ryanair CEO says it won't fly if middle seats have to stay empty for 'idiotic' social distancing rules
Ryanair CEO says it won't fly if middle seats have to stay empty for 'idiotic' 
social distancing rules

Ryanair's CEO said the airline will not fly if it is forced to keep middle seats empty to maintain social distancing to 
stop the coronavirus spread.
Michael O'Leary told the Financial Times that the idea would be "entirely ineffective," making it impossible for the 
airline to make money while also not keeping passengers far enough apart anyway.
"We can't make money on 66% load factors," he said, adding: "The middle seat doesn't deliver any social 
distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway."
Some airlines have said they will keep empty seats between passengers, and the EU said social distancing rules 
will need to be in place. Ryanair is an Irish airline.
Ryanair, like most other airlines, has had to ground most of its flights, but O'Leary said it expects most flights to 
resume this year if a middle seat rule is not put in place.
The CEO of Ryanair, one of the world's largest airlines, said his planes won't fly if the airline has to keep the middle 
seat empty to comply with "idiotic" social distancing rules due to the coronavirus.
Michael O'Leary told the Financial Times that the proposal would be "entirely ineffective" - even as experts 
proposed it and some airlines have agreed to it as a way to keep social distancing in place as countries start to 
reopen and more flights resume.
O'Leary said that the Irish airline's plans to start flying more would be ruined by "some entirely ineffective social 
distancing measures like having middle seats empty because if middle seats are empty we're not returning to flying 
at all."
He said that the airline had told the Irish government that if it tried to impose such a rule then "either the 
government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly."
Ryanair CEO says it won't fly if middle seats have to stay empty for 'idiotic' social distancing rules
O'Leary also said that the airline could not make a profit by having so few people on planes, and that simply not 
having anyone sitting in a middle seat would not leave people far enough apart to create effective social distancing 
anyway.
"We can't make money on 66% load factors. Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn't deliver any social 
distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway," he said.
The low-cost airline, which flies primarily in Europe, is the world's largest airline by the number of routes, and was in 
2019 it ranked as the world's fifth-biggest airline by the number of seats available to passengers.
'If social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over' The idea that planes should fly without a middle seat 
passenger has been recommended by analysts, and the EU's Transport Commissioner, Adina Valean, said some 
social distancing rules will need to be in place in airports and planes, though she did not specify whether there 
would be rules about middle seats.
Long-haul airline Emirates said this week that it will keep empty seats between individuals and groups on flights, 
while US airline Delta said it will leave middle seats empty to "help customers and employees practice social 
distancing."
Alexandre de Juniac, the head of International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the airline industry's global trade 
body - told Reuters that airlines are likely going to have to keep the middle seat empty on flights from now on.
But he has also warned that social distancing measures could particularly harm low-cost airlines, as they would be 
forced to increase ticket prices.
"So it means that if social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over," he said.
It is not yet clear how effective removing the middle passenger would be for social distancing.
The BBC reported that, on an average plane, you would need to be more than four seats apart from other people in 
order to be the recommended two meters or six feet away from each other.
Health experts have been supportive of removing the middle seat in the short term, even as they acknowledged that 
it may not be economically sustainable in the long term, the BBC added.
Like the rest of the industry, Ryanair's flights have been decimated by the virus. As of March, Ryanair was 
operating fewer than 20 flights a day - less than 1% of their usual daily average of 2,500.
O'Leary said the airline expects to run around 40% of its flights in July if air travel is resumed by then, and said that 
around 50% to 60% of the seats would be filled.
He said he expects to run around 80% of its flights by September, but said that these plans would be ruined if the 
airline couldn't fill the middle seat.
The pandemic has already forced some airlines to shut, is expected to cost airlines hundreds of billions of dollars, 
and could cause low-cost fares to disappear.
But O'Leary is positive about his own airline's future, expecting normal traffic to return by summer 2021 and for 
Ryanair to be fueled by rivals collapsing. www.yahoo.com

Ryanair logo Several brokerages have updated their recommendations and price targets on shares of Ryanair 
(NASDAQ: RYAAY) in the last few weeks: 
•
4/23/2020 - Ryanair  was upgraded by analysts at Morgan Stanley from an "equal weight" rating to an 
"overweight" rating.
•
4/7/2020 - Ryanair  was downgraded by analysts at Zacks Investment Research  from a "hold" rating to a 
"strong sell" rating. They now have a $61.00 price target on the stock. According to Zacks, "Ryanair has 
been badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak as Italy, one of its main markets, has been affected 
significantly. Owing to the outbreak, shares of the company have declined 37.1% since the beginning of 
February. Due to the coronavirus-led reduced demand the company lowered its fiscal 2020 traffic forecast 
by 3 million to 151 million. Notably, Ryanair grounded majority of its flights effective Mar 24 and does not 
expect to operate any flight in April and May. Moreover, below-par performance of the Laudamotion unit is 
concerning. However, efforts to add shareholder value are a positive too. Ryanair returned more than  560 
million to its shareholders through this investor-friendly measure in fiscal 2019. Ryanair s efforts to expand 
its fleet size are encouraging as well. Moreover, its environment-friendly efforts are commendable."

Ryanair will not fly under empty seats requirement, says O'Leary; Airlines

Ryanair's chief executive has warned the low-cost airline will not return to flying if governments insist planes leave 
their middle seats empty when travel restrictions are lifted .
Michael O'Leary gave a bullish outlook for a recovery in air travel , laying out plans for the airline to resume 80 per 
cent of flights by September provided that flying in Europe could restart from early July.
The outspoken executive said Ryanair expected to run about 40 per cent of its flights if travel resumed in July, with 
these planes 50 to 60 per cent full. It would then increase capacity to 60 per cent in August and 80 per cent the 
following month, before reducing the number of flights back down to 60 per cent for its less busy winter season.
But in an interview with the Financial Times, Mr O'Leary said its plans would be thwarted if there were "some 
entirely ineffective social distancing measures like having middle seats empty because if middle seats are empty 
we're not returning to flying at all".
He said Ryanair had already advised the Irish government that if it planned to impose such a rule then "either the 
government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly".
"We can't make money on 66 per cent load factors. Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn't deliver any social 
distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway," he said.
Ryanair will not fly under empty seats requirement, says O'Leary; Airlines
Iata, the global airline association, has said it is preparing for potential government measures that may enforce 
social distancing on flights. Several airlines, including Emirates and Delta Air Lines, this week said they would be 
blocking out the middle seats of flights.
Last week easyJet said it expected passengers would want to sit apart and that this would be possible to do on a 
shortterm basis given that demand was not expected to return to previous levels immediately.
But Mr O'Leary said Europe should follow the example of Asian countries and introduce measures such as 
mandatory mask wearing on transport and temperature checks at stations and airports.
Ryanair expected a "relatively quick recovery" in air traffic on the back of "massive price stimulation" if restrictions 
were eased for July.
Mr O'Leary said he was hopeful that, subject to an effective coronavirus vaccine, there would be a return to more 
normal traffic levels in the summer of 2021, driven by the collapse of rival airlines.
"I think Ryanair in summer 2021 will be carrying our 2019 traffic plus growth, but the airports will still have less 
traffic than they had before," he added.
His outlook starkly contrasts with the wider market. Some aviation analysts have forecast it could take up to three 
years for the industry to return to the traffic levels of 2019. Lufthansa has warned it expects any recovery in global 
air travel to take several years.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary said the budget airline will not restart operations 
if it is forced to leave middle seats empty due to social distancing rules, London's Financial Times reported 
Wednesday.
In an interview with the publication, O'Leary said he expects Ryanair to operate about 40% of its flights if flying 
resumes in July, which would increase to 80% by September.
O'Leary, however, said his plans might be blocked by "some entirely ineffective social distancing measures."

 The European Union's Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that Ryanair (RYAAY) must indicate the full price of 
tickets when displaying offers on its website. 
The decision comes after the Italian antitrust authority slammed the Irish budget airline in 2011 for excluding from 
prices a value-added tax on domestic flights as well as check-in fees.
Ryanair will also have to display any fees that would be charged if payment is made via a credit card that is not 
approved by the carrier.
Ryanair representatives were not immediately available for comment on the ruling, according to Reuters.

Highlight: With passenger levels falling by as much as 90%, Citywire Selector looks at the funds and managers 
most exposed to this under pressure area.
Body
The challenges faced by the airline industry are evident, with passenger numbers dropping significantly after 
sustained year-on-year growth and Forbes predicting an industry-wide drop in revenues of around $314bn for 2020.
Fund managers have historically looked at the sector with a mix of scepticism and deep-value opportunism. Warren 
Buffett broke a long-held personal rule to invest in airlines in March, but has sold down exposure this month as the 
industry’s challenges intensified.
If you look at active Ucits funds out there, the Thornburg Global Opportunities  fund is one of the strategies with the 
highest exposure to the budget airline EasyJet, holding on to its 3.05% exposure at the end of February. Lead 
manager Brian McMahon and Miguel Oleaga highlighted how the stock had been among the five poorest 
performers over Q1. Nevertheless it remains part of the portfolio at around 3%.
The Investec GSF Global Value Equity  fund is also among the Ucits-compliant funds with EasyJet exposure 
and had 2.2% allocation at the end of February. The fund currently sits 3,568 out of 3,600 funds in the Equity – 
Global sector over the 12 months to the end of March 2020.
Meanwhile, the Man GLG Income  and Man GLG Undervalued Assets  funds both had exposure to EasyJet and the 
International Consolidated Airlines groups at the end of February. Man GLG declined to comment.
Two other Man GLG funds, with the Man GLG Pan-European Equity Growth  and Man GLG European Alpha 
Income  funds, are exposed to another budget airline Ryanair, having just under 3% exposure to the Irish company.
Citywire A-rated manager Rory Powe, who is number 30 out of 1,011 managers in the Equity – Europe sector over 
12 months to the end of March 2020, runs the Pan-European Equity Growth fund. Despite losing 0.41% over the 
past month, Powe has retained a 4.9% exposure  to Ryanair in his $229m fund.
In his most recent commentary, Powe said: ‘Of course we cannot be sure about the length of the lockdowns. 
Equally we acknowledge that any relaxation of lockdowns may be temporary or partial and hesitantly followed.
Funds set to be hit hard as airlines prepare for 2020 tailspin
‘That said, we believe Ryanair can survive with a grounded fleet for at least 14 months before it is forced to raise 
additional debt or capital (or sell planes into the cargo market). ‘
Citywire + rated David Robinson of Dalton Strategic Partnership previously championed opportunities provided by 
Ryanair in the budget airline industry. However, Robinson removed the position from his $1bn Melchior European 
Opportunities  in March amid the market volatility.
Looking at other airlines stocks, Rothschild & Co is among the firms exposed to Air France, which saw its share 
price drop from €9.81 on 18 February to a low of €4.26 on 12 March before recovering modestly to reach €4.54 on 
23 April.
According to Morningstar, four Rothschild & Co funds had Air France exposure of between 2.3% and 3% as at the 
end of February, these funds being the R-co Midcap France , R-co Conviction France , R-co Selection Euro  and R-
co Conviction Equity Value Euro  funds.
Long/short equity manager Michael Browne previously championed Wizz Air as an investable opportunity when he 
spoke to Citywire Selector at the start of March. The company’s share price has halved since the end of February to 
mid-April.
Funds with exposure as at the end of February were the SVM All Europe SRI  fund, which reduced exposure in 
March according to the managers’ commentary, as well as the BMO Select UK Equity , BMO European Smaller 
Companies , BMO Emerging Markets  and BMO LGM Global Emerging Markets Growth and Income  funds.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/ryanair-boss-michael-oleary-says-airline-wont-fly-with-idiotic-social-
distancing-rules/Ryanair planes won't return to the skies if the airline is forced to leave the middle seat empty to 
comply with 'idiotic' in-flight social distancing rules, its chief executive, Michael O'Leary, has said.The boss of the 
no-frills carrier, which has thrived by packing its flights as full as possible with passengers lured by low prices, has 
previously said that blocking out the space in between seats is 'nonsense' that would have no beneficial effect. He 
doubled down on the comments on Wednesday, saying that if governments insisted on social distancing measures, 
then Ryanair's business model would be in tatters and the carrier would not fly. 
O'Leary said that Ryanair had already told the Irish government that if it imposes the restriction, then 'either the 
government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly'. The Dublin-based carrier's business model relies on flying as 
frequently as possible, stripping out costs and running an extremely high 'load factor', the aviation industry term for 
how full planes are. 'We can't make money on 66% load factors,' he said. 'Even if you do that, the middle seat 
doesn't deliver any social distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway,' he added, 
in an interview with the Financial Times. The global airline industry's trade body, Iata, has predicted huge 
ramifications for airlines as a result of Covid-19, with lost revenues this year set to hit $314bn (255bn). Iata said 
earlier this week that any rules designed to minimise contagion in the skies would temporarily put an end to the 
cheap air travel model pioneered by Ryanair, forcing carriers to raise prices by 50% or go bust. Ryanair's no-frills 
rival easyJet has said it expects socially distanced flights to be possible in the short term, given that demand for air 
travel is likely to be subdued in any case, even after lockdown restrictions ease off. O'Leary said European airlines 
should instead take their cue from Asia and impose different safety measures, such as forcing passengers to wear 
masks or checking their temperature at the airport. Ryanair flew more than 152 million people last year, putting it at 
the top of the league table of European airlines, a position that gives O'Leary a particularly influential voice in the 
industry. He sounded a more upbeat tone than some of his rivals, predicting a return to normal passenger numbers 
by summer 2021, provided a vaccine for Covid-19 can be developed. He said the airline would be able to pick up 
business from rivals that collapse as a result of the pandemic, which has already forced Virgin Australia to file for 
bankruptcy and left Ryanair's European rival Norwegian Air fighting for its survival. Airlines including Ryanair have 
faced criticism for dragging their feet on giving refunds for cancelled flights, as they look to conserve cash during

air travel all but ceased. Read more: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary says airline won't fly with 'idiotic' social

Apr 23, 2020( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Reuters Ryanair's 
CEO said the airline will not fly if it is forced to keep middle seats empty to maintain social distancing to stop the 
coronavirus spread. Michael O'Leary told the Financial Times[1] that the idea would be "entirely ineffective," making 
it impossible for the airline to make money while also not keeping passengers far enough apart anyway. "We can't 
make money on 66% load factors," he said, adding: "The middle seat doesn't deliver any social distancing, so it's 
kind of an idiotic idea that doesn't achieve anything anyway." Some airlines have said they will keep empty seats 
between passengers, and the EU said social distancing rules will need to be in place. 
Ryanair is an Irish airline. Ryanair, like most other airlines, has had to ground most of its flights, but O'Leary said it 
expects most flights to resume this year if a middle seat rule is not put in place. Visit Business Insider's homepage 
for more stories[2]. The CEO of Ryanair, one of the world's largest airlines, said his planes won't fly if the airline has 
to keep the middle seat empty to comply with "idiotic" social distancing rules due to the coronavirus[3]. Michael 
O'Leary told the Financial Times[4] that the proposal would be "entirely ineffective" — even as experts proposed 
it[5] and some airlines have agreed to it as a way to keep social distancing in place as countries start to reopen and 
more flights resume. O'Leary said that the Irish airline's plans to start flying more would be ruined by "some entirely 
ineffective social distancing measures like having middle seats empty because if middle seats are empty we're not 
returning to flying at all." He said that the airline had told the Irish government that if it tried to impose such a rule 
then "either the government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly."O'Leary also said that the airline could not 
make a profit by having so few people on planes, and that simply not having anyone sitting in a middle seat would 
not leave people far enough apart to create effective social distancing anyway. "We can't make money on 66% load 
factors. Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn't deliver any social distancing, so it's kind of an idiotic idea that 
doesn't achieve anything anyway," he said. The low-cost airline, which flies primarily in Europe, is the world's 
largest airline by the number of routes, and was in 2019 itranked as the world's fifth-biggest airline by the number of 
seats[6] available to passengers.'If social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over'The idea that planes should fly 
without a middle seat passenger has been recommended by analysts, [7]and the EU's Transport Commissioner, 
Adina Valean, said some social distancing rules will need to be in place in airports and planes, though she did not 
specify whether there would be rules about middle seats. Long-haul airline Emirates said this week[8] that it will 
The CEO of Ryanair, one of the world's biggest airlines, says it won't fly if middle seats have to stay empty for 
'idiotic' social distancing rules
keep empty seats between individuals and groups on flights, while US airline Delta said it will leave middle seats 
empty[9] to "help customers and employees practice social distancing."Alexandre de Juniac, the head of 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) — the airline industry's global trade body — told Reuters[10] that 
airlines are likely going to have to keep the middle seat empty on flights from now on. But he has also warned[11] 
that social distancing measures could particularly harm low-cost airlines, as they would be forced to increase ticket 
prices. "So it means that if social distancing is imposed, cheap travel is over," he said. It is not yet clear how 
effective removing the middle passenger would be for social distancing. The BBC reported[12] that, on an average 
plane, you would need to be more than four seats apart from other people in order to bethe recommended two 
meters or six feet away from each other. Health experts have been supportive of removing the middle seat in the 
short term, even as they acknowledged that it may not be economically sustainable in the long term, the BBC 
added. Like the rest of the industry, Ryanair's flights have been decimated by the virus. As of March, Ryanair was 
operating fewer than 20 flights a day[13] —less than 1% of their usual daily average of 2,500.O'Leary said the 
airline expects to run around 40% of its flights in July if air travel is resumed by then, and said that around 50% to 
60% of the seats would be filled. He said he expects to run around 80% of its flights by September, but said that 
these plans would be ruined if the airline couldn't fill the middle seat. The pandemic has already forced some 
airlines to shut, is expected to cost airlines hundreds of billions of dollars, and could cause low-cost fares to 
disappear[14]. But O'Leary is positive about his own airline's future, expecting normal traffic to return by summer 
2021 and for Ryanair to be fueled by rivals collapsing.NOW WATCH: We tested a machine that brews beer at the

Apr 23, 2020( Deutsche Welle Business: http://www.dw.com/en/top-stories/s-9097 Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
used to advertise a price that would then rise in the later stages of the booking process due to additional fees. An 
EU court has ruled in favor of Italian authorities who said the practice was incorrect.Ryanair's policy of not including 
surcharges in its initial online prices was deemed unlawful by the EU's top court on Thursday.The Court of Justice 
of the European Union (CJEU) came to the conclusion of wrongdoing after the Italian Competition Authority 
(AGCM) criticized Ryanair in 2011 for prices that did not include value-added tax on domestic flights, as well as 
additional fees for check-in and transactions made by credit card.Read more: Ryanair boss accused of racism after 
saying 'terrorists are generally Muslims'The AGCM argued these were unavoidable payments that customers had to 
make and therefore should be indicated before someone began the booking process.Ryanair took the matter to 
court, prompting Italy's Council of State to ask the CJEU whether the surcharges needed to be included.Read

in favor of the AGCM, citing previous EU case law instructing airlines to specify additional fees from the outset, so

refund,' Which? says in its advice for travellers[9]. 'Make this clear to the firm, in writing. If it still won't do the right 
thing, you could try to claim through your card provider.' Which? says that the company that took your money is 
responsible for issuing your refund. So if it is a flight, for example, you have to check whether you booked with the 
airline or through a third party travel agent. This advice is echoed by MoneySavingExpert[10], which adds that if you 
choose to cancel your travel based on Foreign Office advice[11], it is slightly more complicated and requires you to 
have travel insurance. 'If you've booked a future trip, then your right to cancel and get a refund depends very much 
on the latest UK Government travel advice which is what insurers and airlines generally take their cue from,' the site 
says.  'In some ways though, the Foreign Office now warning against non-essential travel 'indefinitely' makes things 
trickier.' When the end date for that advice was 16 April, many firms were paying out for all travel booked before this 
date, MoneySavingExpert explains. 'But as the warning is now effectively 'no travel until we say so' and we don't 
know when they'll say so, it's likely you'll need to wait until close to your travel date before airlines, hotels and travel 
insurers agree to refund you.' Based on this, the site says that you are unlikely to be refunded if you cancel a trip 
planned for the distant future.However, 'some firms are now being more flexible and in particular letting customers 
rebook', the site adds, meaning that you may need to check if that is an option. World News[12] Law[13]

Airfares show declines as airlines brace for tough recovery
Airfares show declines as airlines brace for tough recovery

Airfares have fallen as much as 30% since the start of the year in North America and Europe, according to the first 
of a new series of industry data, while stabilizing on a smaller decline in Asia where some coronavirus lockdowns 
are being eased.
The figures here from Skytra, an Airbus-owned airline hedging business, offer early clues to the difficult recovery 
awaiting airlines as they prepare for an eventual lifting of restrictions on what is likely to be a changing travel 
market.
After flatlining for weeks, forward bookings show small improvements for May travel between Asia and Europe or 
North America, and positive U.S. domestic reservations for the winter holidays. But they are still down more than 
75% last year.
The data sends a more ominous signal on fares - days after Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary predicted that a traffic 
rebound would be driven by heavy discounting.
"That's what we're seeing now," said Matthew Tringham, strategy and product chief at Skytra, which was launched 
last year to offer revenue-hedging services to airlines.
Skytra's figures show Asia pricing in decline since February, followed by a slump in the United States and Europe 
last month that is steeper and ongoing, as airlines slash fares on the few flights still running.
The findings reflect a rolling average of economy fares on departed flights within each region that were booked over 
the preceding month, drawing on data for 83% of air travel by value.
"As the COVID-19 crisis took hold we saw prices soften in most markets, as any remaining capacity in service is 
being discounted," Skytra said in a report.
"While the Asia-Pacific market seems to have bottomed out about 15% lower than could be expected for this 
period, we can see that the trend in North America and Europe continues with prices down 30% and 25%, 
respectively."
Airfares show declines as airlines brace for tough recovery
As of April 8, average yields - a proxy for fares expressed in revenue per passenger kilometer - had dropped to 10.7 
U.S. cents in North America from 15 cents a year earlier, and to 14 cents in Europe from 19.4 cents. In Asia-Pacific, 
they fell to 9.6 cents from 11.8.
Apart from the Asian intercontinental and U.S. holiday reservations, there is little sign of any revival in forwarding 
bookings, Skytra's Tringham said in an interview. "Europe is not showing any green shoots right now."

Jet fuel demand to remain low as airlines buckle up for tough ride
Jet fuel demand to remain low as airlines buckle up for tough ride

Demand for flights and jet fuel could take years to recover from the coronavirus crisis as airlines struggle to survive 
their worst downturn, haunted by possible changes in the habits of tourists and business travelers.
Among the various fuels, jets have been hit hardest and industry leaders warn it will take years for all-important 
airline-industry demand to return to 2019 levels.
"Jet fuel consumption will be impacted for a longer time and maybe not recover fully even next year, as travelers 
remain concerned about long-haul vacations, and businesses get used to online meetings," said Per Magnus 
Nysveen, head of analysis at Rystad Energy, a consultancy.
Exemptions for agriculture and freight from widespread lockdowns have offered some support to diesel and fuel oil, 
but jet demand remains weak as a significant slice of the world's 23,000-strong commercial plane fleet is in storage.
Jet fuel prices in Singapore JET-SIN have slumped 61% over the last two months. Refining margins or cracks for jet 
fuel in Singapore JETSGCKMc1 are currently lingering at narrow premiums over Dubai crude after hitting minus 
$3.35 per barrel earlier this month, their lowest on record.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), representing airlines, has already warned of a slower recovery 
than in past crises. On Tuesday, it raised its forecast for 2020 revenue losses by 25% to $314 billion.
Director General Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters he sees a staggering lifting of restrictions starting with domestic, 
then regional, and finally intercontinental routes being reopened where fuel consumption plays a critical role.
IATA has warned any recovery would not start before the last quarter of the year.
Planemakers Airbus and Boeing have also warned of an extended crisis, with few analysts predicting a return to 
previous conditions until 2023 or 2024.
According to Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners, it could be almost five years before the active aircraft 
fleet returns to where it was at the end of 2019.
But the head of Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, brushed off forecasts of a sluggish recovery, telling 
Reuters he saw a swift traffic rebound fuelled by "massive price-dumping" in a race to win back passengers.
Jet fuel demand to remain low as airlines buckle up for tough ride
Just as important for fuel demand, many airlines expect to use the crisis to speed up retirements of their oldest and 
thirstiest jets. That said, low oil prices mean the incentive to invest in costly new equipment is tempered for now.

       U.K. stocks gave up early gains to trade on a flat note Thursday after data showed plummeting retail sales 
amid the Covid-19 crisis.
 Retail sales declined at the worst rate on record in March as lockdown measures were introduced, according to the 
British Retail Consortium-KPMG retail sales monitor.
 Total sales fell an annual 4.3 percent - showing the sharpest decline since records started in January 1995 when 
excluding distortions.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 4 points at 5,594 after declining 3.3 percent in the previous session. The 
index hit as high as 5,657 earlier in the day. 
 Budget carrier easyJet advanced 2.3 percent. The airline said it can survive a lengthy grounding of its fleet during 
the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to measures it had taken to shore up its finances. Rival Ryanair rose 1.4 percent. 
 Informa, the world's largest organizer of business conferences and exhibitions, gained about 2 percent. 
 The company announced further cost-reductions including pay cuts, temporary suspension of dividends, 
discussions on a debt covenant waiver and the issue of additional new equity.
 Asset management company Schroders rallied 1.6 percent. The Group said it generated strong flows in the first 
quarter, with net new business totaling 30.4 billion pounds.
 Housebuilder Barratt Developments surged over 4 percent after saying it had 
 completed 11,713 homes in the period to April 12, up from 10,954 homes last year.

       European stocks rebounded on Thursday after a big selloff in the previous session on the back of dismal U.S. 
economic data and persistent worries over the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
 The spread of the coronavirus has slowed somewhat and some European countries unveiled plans to lift lockdown 
restrictions, helping improve investor sentiment. 
 Markets, however, came off their day's highs after data showed U.K. retail sales declined at the worst rate on 
record in March.
 Total sales fell an annual 4.3 percent - showing the sharpest decline since records started in January 1995 when 
excluding distortions, according to the British Retail Consortium-KPMG retail sales monitor.
 Elsewhere, Euro zone industrial production dipped 0.1 percent month-on-month in February, the month before 
coronavirus restrictions were widely introduced in Europe, Eurostat data showed. 
 The pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.7 percent at 325.15 after falling as much as 3.2 percent in the 
previous session to snap a five-session winning streak. 
 The German DAX and France's CAC 40 index were up around 0.8 percent, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was 
marginally lower, giving up all early gains. 
 Novartis shares rose 2.4 percent. The Swiss drug manufacturer has collaborated with TScan Therapeutics for the 
discovery and development of T cell receptor (TCR) therapies to treat solid tumors.
 German online fashion retailer Zalando soared 4.7 percent. The company expressed optimism over the second 
quarter as sales rebounded from a dip in April. 
European Shares Rise Amid Easing Of Coronavirus Curbs
 Medical and safety technology provider Draegerwerk AG fell over 1 percent. The company said it would specify its 
expectations for 2020 with the publication of the half-year results.
 Budget carrier easyJet advanced 2.3 percent. The airline said it can survive a lengthy grounding of its fleet during 
the coronavirus pandemic, thanks to measures it had taken to shore up its finances. Rival Ryanair rose 1.4 percent.

Ryanair sees price war fuelling rapid air travel recovery

Ryanair is steeling for an airline price war that it expects to win once coronavirus restrictions are lifted and 
passengers flock back to tourist destinations, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters.
Brushing off forecasts of a sluggish recovery, O'Leary predicted a swift traffic rebound, with the pain coming instead 
from "massive price-dumping" that traditional airlines now seeking bailouts would struggle to keep up with.
His bullish outlook puts the Ryanair boss at odds with peers such as Lufthansa and analysts who see a return to 
2019 traffic only around 2023-4. Plane manufacturers and airline body IATA have also warned of a slow recovery 
from the pandemic.
O'Leary also voiced dismay at the multi-billion-euro aid packages sought by Lufthansa and Air France-KLM and 
said Ryanair was appealing against EU-approved French tax breaks that exclude airlines registered in other 
European states.
An Air France-KLM spokeswoman declined to comment.
Ryanair assumes European flights will stay grounded until a "limited" resumption in June, O'Leary said. After that, a 
resurgence of intra-European travel will be driven by steep discounts on last-minute holidays in July-August.
"Lots of people across northern Europe have been locked up in apartments," he said. "They will all want to go on 
holiday before the kids go back to school as long as they can do so in reasonable safety."
Ryanair backs anti-coronavirus measures including masks and temperature checks for passengers and crew while 
rejecting calls for planes to fly one-third empty.
Before too long, "volumes will be back on a normal footing but on lower pricing" O'Leary predicted. "The minute 
we're about to start flying again we'll start doing seat sales, and so will every other airline."
But a low-cost model and robust balance sheet make Ryanair better prepared for a fare-slashing recovery, with 
pricing unlikely to improve before next year, he added.
Sounding another discordant note amid the coronavirus gloom, he said the summer of 2021 had huge potential as 
holidaymakers make up for the previous year's thwarted plans.
Ryanair sees price war fuelling rapid air travel recovery
O'Leary said he planned to hold onto all existing Boeing 737 MAX jet orders and even dangled the prospect of 
adding more of the currently grounded planes - and repeating a Ryanair habit of buying when demand and prices 
are low.

Wizz Air axes a fifth of jobs and cuts pay Airlines

Wizz Air, the Hungarian low-cost airline, is cutting close to a fifth of its workforce and reducing the pay of senior 
management, pilots and crew to cope with the collapse in European air travel caused by measures to contain 
coronavirus.
The carrier also warned that profits for the financial year that ended in March would be lower than expected owing 
to an exceptional (EURO)70m-(EURO)80m hit on hedging. About 1,000 employees would be made redundant, with 
further measures to furlough staff expected in the short-term due to travel restrictions, the group said yesterday.
Chief executive Jozsef Varadi, the board and senior management will take a 22 per cent pay cut, while the salaries 
of pilots, cabin crew and office staff will be reduced by 14 per cent. The group is the latest carrier to announce 
cashsaving measures as airlines around the world seek to bolster liquidity in the face of the collapse in revenues.
Iata, the aviation trade body, said that it estimated that about a third of the global industry's 2.7m jobs had been cut 
or suspended.
Lufthansa, Europe's second-biggest airline, warned last week that it expected any recovery in global air travel to 
take several years as it cut back its fleet and axed Germanwings, its lowcost brand.
Fitch, the credit rating agency, last week downgraded both Ryanair and Wizz Air, citing uncertainty over the timing 
and conditions of recovery. Fitch said that it did not expect Wizz Air's revenue to recover to previous levels before 
the 2022-23 fiscal year.
Wizz Air axes a fifth of jobs and cuts pay Airlines
About 90 per cent of European flights were grounded in the first week of April, according to Iata, with those aircraft 
still flying largely being used for cargo or the repatriation of citizens. Wizz Air said it was flying just 3 per cent of its 
capacity.
However, the carrier stressed that it had (EURO)1.5bn in cash at the end of March 2020, giving it strong liquidity to 
navigate the crisis.
Nevertheless, Mr Varadi said that the group was reviewing the competitiveness and allocation of assets.
Wizz Air has more than 200 aircraft on order, most of which are the Airbus A321 single aisle. Only recently the Wizz 
Air boss insisted that he intended to take delivery of all his aircraft. However, it is possible that the company could 
seek to defer some orders.
Wizz now plans to hand back 32 rented aircraft at the end their leases, many of which had been expected to remain 
in the fleet until the new A321s arrived. Mr Varadi said that "as markets normalise" the plan to increase capacity by 
an average of 15 per cent a year would be maintained.
The carrier is also pressing ahead with plans to launch a Gulf low-cost operation, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, in the second 
half of this year.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/180-romanian-fruit-pickers-fly-into-stansted-as-farming-association-warns-
food-will-rot-in-the-fields/British crops may 'rot in the fields' unless 80,000 farm workers are found, a farming 
association has warned - with a private charter plane of 180 Romanian fruit pickers due to land at Stansted airport 
tomorrow to tackle the shortages.The stark warning comes after producers issued a nationwide appeal for Brits join 
a new 'Land Army' of farm workers to pick fruit and vegetables amid the coronavirus lockdown. They will then be 
taken to Lincolnshire by bus, with the flight believed to be just the first of six. The Country Land & Business 
Association has admitted the number of British volunteers is still not enough, with a spokesman saying that they 
wouldn't be surprised if more foreign workers are flown in to avoid food 'rotting in the fields'. CLA President Mark 
Bridgeman said: 'Over 30,000 people have come forward to help farmers[1], following the call to 'Feed the Nation', 
through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
'This is great news and shows a tremendous attitude at these difficult times. But this excellent response in not 
enough - we need 80,000 people to ensure fruit and vegetables are picked on time this summer. 'Where it is 
possible and safe to do so in the current circumstances, bringing in workers from overseas to help meet the shortfall 
is the right thing to do if we want to keep the supermarkets stocked. 'However we would strongly encourage people 
from across the country to keep coming forward and signing up with recruitment agencies. 'There are good jobs 
available and great opportunities for those currently furloughed, unemployed or students.' Tomorrow's flight is 
coming from Bucharest to London. Surrey-based Air Charter Service said a private farming company in the UK has 
paid for Thursday's flight. It did not name the firm. An Airbus A320 aircraft will be used, at an estimated cost of 200-
250 per seat. Air Charter Service confirmed that an airline based at Stansted would operate the flight, which was 
booked last week. Carriers based at the Essex airport include Ryanair, Jet2.com and Tui Airways. The workers on 
the Boeing 737 will be taken by bus to farms across the southeast of the UK and Lincolnshire. Passengers on board 
the aircraft will be required to maintain social distancing guidelines and will not be allowed to leave Romania if they 
display any symptoms of Covid-19. At least 10 other flights have been arranged by Air Charter Service to take farm 
workers from Romania and Bulgaria to Germany. The move has shone the spotlight on the so-called 'Land Army' 
initiative, which was supposed to fill Britain's farming needs with British workers currently at home amid the 
lockdown. The 'Land Army' scheme is being led by Concordia, a charity which provides seasonal labour for farms, 
180 Romanian fruit pickers fly into Stansted as farming association warns 'food will rot in the fields'
as well as HOPS and Fruitful. Concordia says almost 90 per cent of applicants are British citizens - and half have 
either been furloughed or out of work completely because of coronavirus. They add their roles for April have been 
filled, but they are still looking for more workers from May onwards. Stephanie Maurel, the chief executive of 
Concordia, said pickers earn an average of 350 a week for around 40 hours of work. The least they will be paid is 
the national minimum wage of 8.72 per hour - but the faster workers could be paid up to 15 per hour depending on 
how much they pick. The working day will begin between 5am and 6am, finishing in the early afternoon to avoid 
physical work in the hottest part of the day, A spokesman said: 'Concordia is working with Fruitful and HOPS to help 
find people to fill positions on UK farms. 'Successful applicants will receive training on the farm (and are paid to 
undertake this training) and can be assured that all farms, many of which are open fields, are following the correct 
procedures around safe working conditions during the Coronavirus outbreak. 'Housing is always provided although 
participants do not have to take it up.' 'To date we have had more than 32,000 applications of interest in the 
programme - from people all over the UK, and beyond. 'Of those 13% are then opting to interview for a role (an 
automatic process) - currently just over 4,000. We are now matching these people to roles and placing them on UK 
farms. 'Almost 90% of applicants are from UK citizens. Half of whom have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-
19 outbreak. Only 30% have worked in farming in the past.' The British Growers Association says around 6,000 
pickers are needed from mid-April to pick asparagus, and the same again to pick salads and lettuce. By May at 
least 30,000 people will be needed to pick strawberries and at least 10,000 more to pick soft fruits such as 
raspberries. Later in the summer another 10,000 will be needed to pick apples and pears. Next month tens of 
thousands will be needed cauliflowers, cucumbers and spring greens and other common vegetables like onions. 
Farmers and food plants hit with staff shortages will be allowed to recruit furloughed workers from other businesses 
to 'feed the nation'. The move comes in response to warnings of chaos in some sectors and fears crops will be left 
to rot in the fields. Thousands of businesses, from retailers to pubs, have put their staff on furlough, which means 
the taxpayer will pay them 80 per cent of their wage. Originally, this payment was denied to the company if these 
workers went on to find a second job to bring in cash. However, the Treasury has updated its guidance to say: 'You 
may undertake other employment while your current employer has placed you on furlough, and this will not affect 
the grant that they can claim under the scheme.' The net effect is that people on furlough could receive 80 per cent 
of their pay from their main employer while collecting a second wage for fruit picking. Importantly, these people 
must be able to return to work for their main employer as and when required. It comes as the Government's 
watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, today warned the economy could shrink by more than a third this 
quarter alone with two million people made jobless if the lockdown continues for two more months. Shocking 
analysis from the OBR underlines the trade-offs being made to combat the deadly disease by putting the country 
into lockdown. It warns curbs staying in place for three months will slash GDP by 35 per cent, with unemployment 
soaring to 10 per cent and the government's deficit hitting 273billion - the highest level since the Second World 
War. The watchdog ominously said it was assumed 'for now' there will not be any permanent economic damage, 
and much of the crash will be unwound as pent-up demand is unleashed when the lockdown finally ends. However, 
the resulting 13 per cent year-on-year drop will still be worse than anything in the last century. Responding to the 
chilling scenario - which emerged as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted the worst global downturn 
since the Great Depression in 1929 - Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: 'People should know there is hardship ahead.' 
The apocalyptic figures emerged after Dominic Raab moved to quash the idea of an imminent loosening, with the 
UK now facing restrictions until at least May 7. But there is growing alarm about the potential death toll from 
economic misery, with life expectancy set to take a major hit. Doctors have also warned that suspending all non-
urgent NHS operations to focus on coronavirus cases means more cancer and heart disease patients will die. The 
Cabinet is divided over whether to push to ease the lockdown soon, with some saying the public is obeying social 
distancing too well and that people must be urged to keep working where possible. But concerns have been raised 
that it is impossible to lift the curbs at the moment anyway because the public is so strongly in favour of them 
staying in place, and would simply refuse to go back to normal. Read more: 180 Romanian fruit pickers fly into

Many European airlines spent much of the past two decades asking governments to leave the airline industry. Now, 
many are begging for help, and most will get it, even if all may not deserve saving.
It is different than in the United States. The U.S. government is bailing out airlines because the country needs a 
robust transportation network, but if one carrier doesn't make it, life will go on. Other airlines, perhaps even new 
ones, will fill gaps.
In Europe, bailout discussion is more fraught. In this crisis, governments are not always thinking about how many 
capacity markets need, but instead about national pride. Regardless of market conditions, lawmakers may not want 
to see national airlines go bust, for reasons of politics, nostalgia, and even national security.
In the coming weeks, politicians will leverage state aid rules that allow them to help national carriers in a crisis. 
Some airlines will get loans, while others may get the ultimate saving - re-nationalization.
Just as in the United States, many larger airline groups deserve aid. In recent years, International Airlines Group, 
owner of British Airways, and Lufthansa Group have shed bloated pasts, even if they still might operate more 
brands than necessary. Air France-KLM is behind, but is improving, and deserves help, as do Ryanair and EasyJet, 
two behemoths of pre-Covid 19 Europe that set standards for low-cost airlines everywhere.
What about the rest? Amid the chaos, some European countries may boost airlines that probably don't need to 
exist. Italy's Alitalia tops every list, but there are others. Does Scandinavia need two airlines? Does Austria need 
one? What about Belgium? How about Portugal?
Consider that the European Union is a single market, and an airline from one member state can fly any route from 
or within another. If policymakers seek air service, they can entice any EU-flagged airline to fly. Yet, that may not 
matter now, with many governments poised to rescue airlines that fly their flags.
"You are going to see significant state involvement," said Samuel Engel, senior vice president and head of the 
aviation group at ICF, a consulting firm. "It is less likely to look like the national carriers of the pre-privatization era. 
But it will have many of the same effects. The governments may be on the hook for their debts, or may justify a 
level of service."
Some poor performing European airlines could disappear
It's an interesting reversal of recent trends, said Engel, who has advised airlines on how to privatize to get away 
from government interference.
"We are in an extraordinary situation, aren't we?" he said. "I don't think anyone thought governments would have to 
go back in."
With five strong airline groups, Europe probably would look like the United States, where six carriers control the 
vast majority of market share. Travelers may not love the arrangement - some complaint about lack of competition - 
but it served consumers well through much of the past decade.
That's unlikely to happen, however.
Just look at Alitalia. It has been a mess for years, and each time it appears to be on the brink of liquidation, the 
Italian government, or an arm of the Italian government, steps in. The EU limits how much state aid airlines can 
receive, so insiders figured eventually the airline would disappear. But the Italian government decided not to let a 
good crisis go to waste, so it re-nationalized Alitalia.
"The funny thing is before the crisis there were lots of insolvencies in Europe and since the crisis, there is no 
insolvency," said Martin Gauss, CEO of Air Baltic, a state-owned Latvian carrier.
Other airlines have similar situations. Norwegian Air was in trouble before the novel Coronavirus pandemic and 
might have failed in a typical recession. Now, the airline has appealed to Norway's government, accepting about 
$290 million in guarantees last month, though it said it needs much more from private markets.
It's an interesting juxtaposition for an airline that two years ago argued against government interference. After 
Norway sold its shares in its national airline, Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian CEO Bjorn Kjos told Skift the 
government made the right decision.
"Some countries have gotten to their senses and they are trying to get out of these legacy airlines," said Kjos, who 
retired last year. "You don't need it. It's just a waste. You should concentrate on totally different things."
These days, Scandinavian Airlines, or SAS, is not in much better shape. As the national carrier of three countries - 
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark - its limited resources have been stretched across three hubs, rather than one 
strong one. SAS also lacks a strong transatlantic joint venture partner, so it underperforms on U.S. routes.
"You would not invent an airline owned by a government, never mind by two or three governments," said John 
Strickland, a UK-based airline consultant.
Another airline in a similar predicament is TAP Air Portugal. It has built a decent franchise with flights to the United 
States and Brazil but lacks the breadth of larger groups. The government already owns half of TAP but could have 
to provide further assistance.
Will these airlines go away? Norwegian might, because it lacks the rich history of the others and already was 
struggling.
The others are more likely to survive, though Strickland asked if governments might give up if the climate worsens. 
In a worst-case scenario, more governments might be OK with running an airline - Poland, Romania, Finland, and 
Latvia already control their national carriers - but others may find it to be too much, considering how many other 
elements of their economies may need assistance.
"There is national pride, and if we put in the unquantifiable effect of populist governments, it makes it even more 
challenging," Strickland said. "But we have never faced a crisis like this one. There are so many elements about 
how this will turn out."
Broadly speaking, the five major European groups have major advantages over independent airlines. But some 
groups also have issues.
Some poor performing European airlines could disappear
As the weakest among them, Air France-KLM was in some peril before the crisis, with CEO Ben Smith wrestling 
with how to compete on short-haul routes with low-cost-carriers and domestic routes with high-speed trains. Given 
the importance of the company for France and the Netherlands - both nations own part of Air France-KLM - the 
airlines should make it, but it could be expensive for each nation.
"It is now clearer than ever that support from our both Dutch and French governments is needed to meet our cash 
requirements and enable us to continue our operations once the crisis is over," Smith said last week.
There are bigger questions about some Lufthansa Group brands. Lufthansa, the German airline, probably is 
continental Europe's most successful carrier, and its government will help it. Swiss International Air Lines, a 
Lufthansa Group airline, also is a robust carrier with a successful hub in Zurich.
But Lufthansa Group also owns Brussels Airlines and Austrian Airlines, and each is in some danger.
To the Austrian people and politicians, the airline remains a patriotic symbol that carries the nation's flag around the 
world and provides vital air links. But Austrian, founded in 1957, is no longer a "real" airline, as Ryanair, which has 
its own Austrian arm, made clear after the government signaled it might pump as much as 800 million euros into it.
"We do not believe that Lufthansa should receive state aid from Austrian taxpayers in exactly the same way we do 
not believe that Ryanair should receive state aid from Austrian taxpayers," Andreas Gruber, a Ryanair Group 
executive, said, according to Reuters. In effect, Gruber said, Austrians would be assisting a German company.
Brussels Airlines has been a poor performer for Lufthansa Group could disappear without hurting consumers. 
Presumably, Lufthansa could take over the airline's most profitable routes. But the Belgian government may provide 
assistance nonetheless.
If the goal is to get people from point A to point B, perhaps not every country needs an airline. If demand exists, 
some carriers will fill it, even if the airline is not based in that country.
Ryanair and Wizzair have made a fortune filling in gaps on short-haul routes, and someday, people in Austria might 
get used to flying Lufthansa to New York or Los Angeles rather than the national airline.
But even in 2020, some arguments remain for why a country needs a flag carrier. Over the past month, many flag 
airlines have been repurposed by governments, flying medical cargo, and repatriation flights. Governments could 
contract that flying to outside entities, but perhaps there is something comforting about sending the national airline 
abroad.
"We are seeing governments around the world take drastic and quick actions to sustain their people," Engel said.
National airlines may also help in recovery. Eventually, the economic and public health climate will improve and 
airlines will benefit. But short term, governments may need airlines to fly money-losing routes to get people where 
they need to go. There are other ways to do this - the Italian government could offer subsidies to an outside carrier 
like Ryanair - but propping up the local airline may be a better move, politically.
Still, Air Baltic's Gauss said he expects not every flag carrier will make it. He said his airline works as a government-
owned enterprise because Latvia has limited connections with the rest of Europe. But other countries don't have 
these limitations.
"There might be some states like Italy who say, OK, we now definitely need a state-controlled airline but the other 
countries may be OK with their air infrastructure being served by other carriers," Gauss said. "I don't think that we 
will see this coming back where every country has its own airline." skift.com

Yates Airlines have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, in many cases grounding their entire fleets, 
furloughing thousands of staff, and issuing dire warnings about their future. Some budget airlines in Europe have 
already collapsed. Even after the pandemic ends, changes in the market could drive up the famously low ticket 
prices that opened up the continent, or force airlines to change the way they fly. But airlines' best call may ultimately 
be to tempt back travellers through cheap flights — if they can afford it. 
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. As governments around the world close their borders and 
advise against travel, demand for air travel has plummeted, causing airlines to ground their entire fleets[2]. Airlines 
have left planes sitting idle on runways, and furloughed hundreds of thousands of staff. The head of the 
International Air Transport Association, an organization representing the world's airlines, said[3]"the air transport 
industry is in its deepest crisis ever." The pandemic has left virtually all of the world's airlines at risk of 
bankruptcy[4]. Some have already collapsed. One analyst said that, even in the best-case scenario, pre-outbreak 
levels of demand will not return until at least mid-2021[5].And when that demand does return, the industry will not 
be the same as before. There's uncertainty about which airlines will survive, how many people will want to fly after a 
pandemic, and the what kind of new precautions airlines may take in future. John Strickland, an independent air 
transport consultant, told Business Insider that one thing is for sure: "Aviation is going to be smaller." And among 
the things at risk are Europe's famously cheap flights, which regularly let people fly for the equivalent of just a few 
dollars, and for some underpin their entire way of life.Liberal aviation restrictions, plus an abundance of airlines 
competing with each other — far more than in the US — resulted in what are often very low prices. With Ryanair, 
outside of peak times, flights across Europe rarely cost more than €100 ($109), and its sales sees flights for as little 
as €9.99, €5, or even €0.01, for flights. "Those markets have grown enormously because many people who couldn't 
afford to travel before have done so whether it is for visiting friends and family going on holiday," Strickland said. 
The result is not only uber-cheap flights, but the knock-on effects of tourism booms and people moving to work all 
over the continent. Among the largest are Irish airline Ryanair and UK airline EasyJet, the biggest and fourth-
biggest airlines in the world respectively by their number of routes. Both are hurting from the crisis — and any 
collapses, or changes to their models, would have huge impacts on the way people fly.The biggest low-cost airlines 
are under immense pressureThe Irish Times reported that Ryanair is now operating fewer than 20 flights a day[6], 
As the coronavirus ravages airlines, Europe's ultra-cheap budget flights could disappear
less than 1% of their usual daily average of 2,500. And EasyJet is not offering any flights. It has grounded its entire 
fleet of planes[7] and is furloughed its 4,000 cabin crew based in the UK.The airline has deferred 24 of the planes it 
had ordered from Airbus,[8] after Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the airline's founder, said the airline would run out of 
money in August unless it scrapped the entire 4.5 billion order for 107 planes, which said were now "useless." The 
companyhas since secured[9] a 600 million loan from the UK Treasury and said it will bring its cash reserves to 2.3 
billion this week. Haji-Ioannou, who is now a major shareholder, had threatened to "personally sue those 
scoundrels"[10]if the company took the loan and still went ahead with the order for 107 planes.Ryanair is among 
Europe's best-placed airlines to ride out the crisisAnalysts have noted that Ryanair has €4 billion of cash on hand 
— enough for 18 months[11]. This makes it one of Europe's best-placed airlines. Strickland said that Ryanair has a 
"phenomenal amount of money" and is "not loaded down with debt" from its plane purchases. He credits this to the 
airline's "aggressive approach" to being low-cost — an approach that made it famous both for one-cent flights sales 
and unpopular money-saving policies like passengers only being able to bring a tiny bag on board without paying 
more. Ryanair at one stage even proposed charging passengers to use the bathroom[12], and has explored 
"standing" seats to it could fit more passengers on planes."Some people look at Ryanair's margins of profitability 
and would think it's excessive," Strickland said. "I've seen so many failures and so much weakness that I defend an 
airline like Ryanair and its need to have that money in the bank." Dr. David Warnock-Smith, an air transport adviser 
and head of aviation at the UK's Buckinghamshire New University, told Business Insider that "only very few, maybe 
a handful of carriers worldwide, have substantial cash reserves." Strickland credited Ryanair's reserves to the way 
that it, like many low-cost airlines "will really negotiate toughly on every cost, particularly airport charges" to bring 
costs to a minimum. And the airline has thrived after previous industry shocks, like the September 11 attacks in 
New York, when it used the opportunity to buy more planes from Boeing. But savings could potentially make it 
harder to get the financial relief that governments are exploring to keep airlines afloat.Warnock-Smith said that 
asking for government support when you have substantial cash reserves is "tricky." "The longer this outbreak goes 
on, the worse it will be for those that have actually made substantial cash reserves. Because there's absolutely no 
chance they will get any support until they are on death's door."The collapse of some airlines could make tickets 
more expensiveThe crisis could result in more expensive flights, or changes to the way flights are run. Andrew 
Charlton, an independent aviation analyst, told Business Insider that reduced economic activity and flight demand 
could cause the collapse of many airlines — potentially creating a landscape in Europe that more closely resembles 
the US. In the US, he said, the top four airlines control more than 80% of the market[13] as of 2018. But in Europe, 
the top four control 40%. "I think what's going to happen is that we get a significantly smaller number of airlines, and 
those airlines will start to behave a little bit more like the airlines in the United States behave. In other words: with 
fewer airlines, fares go up." This would mean fewer airlines to meet demand, so those that remain could decide to, 
or might have to, increase fares. But higher fares could put people off flying when airlines need travellers the most. 
Warnock-Smith said Europe's prices got so cheap because there are so many airlines: "Supply is higher than 
demand, which has led to a surplus of seats, and that's put downward pressure on fares."He said if airlines 
collapse, and then demand for flights picks up again, "we might see higher fares because, because demand will 
outweigh the supply." But he said that would only be likely for a "temporary period." Some European budget airlines 
have already collapsed. UK airline Flybe cited the virus when it collapsed in March[14], and Lufthansa shut its 
budget airline Germanwings[15] in April as it restructured, warning that it will take "years until the worldwide 
demand for air travel returns to pre-crisis levels."And flying could change with airlines that surviveLow-cost airlines 
could end up making changes to some of their unpopular cost-saving policies, or double down on them. In the case 
of Ryanair, Strickland said: "I think the one thing that you can safely guarantee is that they will do whatever they 
think makes them profitable." He said that some carriers could return to the market with a smaller offering of flights, 
even if the reduced offering is temporary. Some airlines might expand to capitalize on weakness in their rivals or 
new openings in the market. Strickland said entire routes could be left up for grabs, pushing airlines into new 
spaces. It could even push some airlines to branch into areas they have never entered, like Ryanair into long-haul 
flights."[Ryanair CEO] Michael O'Leary has time and time again denied that he ever wants to do that. But gosh, if at 
the moment, given how everything else has changed, there's no reason why that might not change as well. We just 
don't know." The most vulnerable airlines could be driven to ultra-low fares to entice travellers, even if that is not 
sustainable, Strickland said. "Some airlines, which frankly have bad business models or bad locations or whatever 
... are going to do stupid things." He said a "fundamental flaw" in aviation economics could occur, whereby "a good, 
successful airline can put a ticket out at a particular price in the market and then an irresponsible, financially 
struggling, bankrupt airline can put out a ridiculous fare." And extended social distancing requirements may mean 
As the coronavirus ravages airlines, Europe's ultra-cheap budget flights could disappear
people have to stay further apart on planes. "If there are going to be those kind of restrictions, what would that 
mean for flights?" Strickland asked."Would that mean that airlines are going to have to fly, let's say half full, or 
always have a middle seat free as you would typically have in a business class?" "That would arguably force you to 
put prices up — but if you put prices up then you get less people going anyway." One Wall Street analyst has 
already recommended that the middle seats of planes be removed[16]. But Warnock-Smith said spacing out 
passengers would be a huge financial risk for airlines.Airlines also have to hope that people will want to flyAirlines 
will need people to actually want to fly — and for countries to want visitors when the outbreak ends. Strickland said 
that Ryanair and EasyJet can typically tempt people with cheap prices during any uncertainty: "They've got so many 
wonderful places. They know people are going to take advantage." "But at the moment there's much wider 
uncertainties: We don't know how much demand there will be." He estimated that demand will be "substantially" 
lower. Reasons may include people having less money being of a wider economic collapse, and lingering fears of 
flying from the pandemic.Warnock-Smith said that people are likely to take fewer non-compulsory trips. "I think 
initially there'll be sort of a lack of confidence and then over time that will pick up again, just like after September the 
11th." Many popular low-cost destinations, like Spain, France, and Italy, are among the worst-hit. "We don't know 
what state these markets will be in," Strickland said, either in wanting visitors or visitors wanting to go there. They 
key could be in keeping the cheap flights that won over customers in the first place. Strickland said that airlines' 
response to other crises, like the September 11 attacks or the 2008 financial crisis, was to set prices that incentivize 
flyers. "I keep using Ryanair as an example, but it's certainly the best one," he said. "They've offered prices at 
almost nothing," he said, "to kickstart the market and get people back to flying." But the question remains as to 
whether Ryanair, or any other airline, will be in a position to do it.NOW WATCH: What it takes to be a first-class

Southwest Airlines undertook 56 flights last week without any passengers.
Due to the COVID-19 repercussions, Southwest has had to reduce its flights to an absolute minimum as the 
airline's Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven commented "We expect our flying to be reduced by roughly 50 
percent over the next couple of months - and we will likely need to do more."
Van de Ven stated that the airline is operating with very few passengers, only continuing air travel when it is critical 
to move around cargo with government aid which has been provided to airlines.
Ryanair has also operated "ghost flights" with a spokesperson of the airline stating that "to ensure our aircraft are 
serviceable for both passenger repatriation flights and essential flights for the transportation of urgent medical 
supplies, some of our crew and aircraft must remain available and serviceable."

Apr 09, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With multiple countries 
on lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, air-travel demand has been dealt a body blow. To combat this 
unprecedented low-demand scenario, airlines across the globe are cutting capacity.Akin to other carriers across the 
globe, namely United Airlines UAL[1], Gol Linhas GOL[2] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], Allegiant Travel 
Company ALGT) [4]also reduced its schedule for the usually busy summer season. Notably, the companyoperates 
a low-cost passenger airlinethrough its subsidiary Allegiant Air.With cancellations exceeding booking by some 
distance, the company's top line gets stressed. 
In fact, March revenues are likely to have been affected year over year by 40-45%.Due to dwindling demand, the 
company trimmed its March capacity as well, down 12.2% on a year-over-year basis. With demand continuing to 
disappear as the pandemic shows little signs of subsiding, the companies even plan deeper capacity cuts for April 
and May. Allegiant expects capacity for April and May to plummet in the 80-90% range year over year.Thanks to 
this unparalleled crisis, Allegiant's daily cash burn is estimated between $2 and $2.5 million. As a result, this Zacks 
Rank # 5 (Strong Sell) is seeking government assistance and trying out other financing alternatives to shore up its 
balancesheet.You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5].Beleaguered by 
this pandemic, majority ofthe stocks have been displaying a downtrend on the bourse. Shares ofAllegiant have lost 
54.3% compared with theindustry[6]'s 56.2% decline since the beginning of March.Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a 
GenerationBe among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as 
the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the 
process, it's expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.A select few stocks could 
skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying 
Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks' just-released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch. The report is only available for

According to Zacks, "Ryanair has been badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak as Italy, one of its main markets, has 
been affected significantly. Owing to the outbreak, shares of the company have declined 37.1% since the beginning 
of February. Due to the coronavirus-led reduced demand the company lowered its fiscal 2020 traffic forecast by 3 
million to 151 million. Notably, Ryanair grounded majority of its flights effective Mar 24 and does not expect to 
operate any flight in April and May. Moreover, below-par performance of the Laudamotion unit is concerning. 
However, efforts to add shareholder value are a positive too. Ryanair returned more than €560 million to its 
shareholders through this investor-friendly measure in fiscal 2019. Ryanair's efforts to expand its fleet size are 
encouraging as well. Moreover, its environment-friendly efforts are commendable."A number of other equities

Apr 08, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  In the past week, Latin 
American carrier Gol Linhas GOL[1] reported a massive decline in March traffic and occupancy rate as coronavirus 
persistently paralyzed air-travel demand. Meanwhile, this U.S. based Delta Air Lines DAL[2] expects its second-
quarter 2020 (Apr-Jun) revenues to shrink as much as 90% in the face of plummeting passenger revenues induced 
by the COVID-19 pandemic.Moreover, Alaska Air Group's ALK[3] wholly owned subsidiary Alaska Airlines 
announced further capacity cuts for April and May to combat the extremely bleak air-travel demand scenario. Due 
to the coronavirus-caused turbulence in the airline space, capacity-cut updates [4]were also available in the 
previous week.Across the pond, Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] reported a 48% year-over-year 
decline in March traffic to 5.7 million with widespread travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic.Summary of 
the Past Week's Key Headlines1. Due to the coronavirus-led uncertainty, Gol Linhas suspended its guidance for 
2020 and2021. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company announced cost-cutting measures like tax deferrals to 
drive its bottom line in the face of dwindling revenues. Meanwhile, its March consolidated traffic, measured in 
revenue passenger kilometers, declined 29.7%. With Gol Linhas trimming capacity to compensate dwindling 
demand, consolidated capacity (measured in available seat miles) contracted 22.2%.Occupancy rate fell to 71.6% 
[6]from 79.3% in March 2019.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7].2. 
Delta expects its second-quarter 2020 performance to be worse than the first as coronavirus pandemic concerns 
are on the rise. 
Meanwhile, Delta is burning more than $60 million in cash each day but hasn't 'seen the bottom' yet. With crumbling 
air-travel demand, the airline will continue to slash capacity while maintaining a network of only essential services. 
In April, the carrier will reduce capacity by at least 80% with 115,000 flight cancellations. Meanwhile, Delta 
submitted its application for the coronavirus relief grant[8].3. Alaska Airlines plans to lower April and May capacity 
by 80% as the carrier continues to experience more than 80% decline in demand amid the coronavirus crisis. With 
the health hazard continuing unabated, the airline expects to make 'sizeable cuts' in June and beyond as well. 
Previously, Alaska Airlines was expected to lower capacity for April and May by 70%.To cope with this deep crisis, 
the carrier took several cost-reduction initiatives[9].4 American Airlines AAL[10] aims to cancel more flights to and 
from New York City area airports due to 'rapidly evaporating" travel demand as COVID-19 cases increase in the 
region. Notably, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an advisory warning against all non-

essential travel to and from New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. American Airlines will now operate only 13 
daily flights[11] from New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports and New Jersey's Newark airport between Apr 9 and 
May 6.5. As a result of the coronavirus-triggered difficulty, Ryanair expects its fiscal 2020 Profit After Tax in the 
€950-€1,000 million band(which is at the lower end of the earlier guided range). The company will release its fiscal 
2020 results on May 18. With flights mainly operating for emergency purposes, Ryanair currently runs less than 20 
flights a day, reflecting an enormous 99% reduction[12] from the 2,500 plus flights that took to the skies daily prior 
to the COVID-19 outbreak.Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the past six months.The table above shows that most airline stocks have traded in 
the red over the past week, inducing a 5.8% decline in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index to $42.63. This downtrend 
was due to the coronavirus-induced fast-vanishing air-travel demand. Over the course of past six months, the 
NYSE ARCA Airline Index has tanked 56.7%.Free: Zacks' Single Best Stock Set to DoubleToday you are invited to

Ryanair has been operating ghost flights in order to prove that their aircraft are still flying, operating short trips but 
as an empty aircraft.
Many airlines have decided to ground their fleets, but the Irish low-cost carrier has continued to fly their aircraft 
every four days to maintain operational availability. If an aircraft is grounded for a significant amount of time, they 
are required to go through checks before returning to service making it unavailable for longer.
Therefore, Ryanair has chosen to fly most of its grounded fleet for a short amount of time in order to avoid these 
checks, taking off and then immediately returning in most cases.
With Ryanair claiming to be the greenest airline in Europe, this decision has questioned the airlines impact on the 
environment. Despite having only emitting 69g of CO2 per passenger per kilometre, these ghost flights are still 
producing carbon dioxide.
An airline spokesperson stated that "in order to ensure our aircraft are serviceable for both passenger repatriation 
flights and essential flights for the transportation of urgent medical supplies, some of our crew and aircraft must 
remain available and serviceable in line with Boeing requirements and EASA regulations."
The airline does not expect to operate the majority of its flights until June at the earliest which could mean a 
consequence of two months of aircraft emissions without passengers.

Unquestionably, the coronavirus has had a devastating impact on the airline and hotel industries, a fact that has 
been further evidenced in findings from SEMrush, a trends data analytic firm, which tracked Google search volume 
for the two travel segments.
The company's industry-wide, branded airline searches found a 17 percent decline from January through February.
The hardest hit carriers were Bangkok Airways (-33 percent), China Eastern (-33 percent) and China Southern (-45 
percent.)
On a brighter note, searches were expected to increase on average by 16.5 percent in March, according to 
SEMrush.
Meanwhile, airlines were extremely active on social media in February and March in order to conduct "damage 
control," the company said.
SEMrush also conducted a Twitter sentiment analysis to gauge reaction to each global carrier. The most tweeted 
airlines were, respectively, Delta Air Lines, Ryanair, EasyJet, American Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa, Qantas, 
Southwest Airlines and KLM.
Interestingly, the data analysis uncovered that Twitter activity was typically more positive than negative - with the 
exception of Alitalia. Lufthansa "had the highest amount of tweets that used a negative tone," SEMrush said.
Qatar received the largest amount of tweets "using positive language to describe the airline," followed by 
Southwest, Turkish Airlines and SAS, the company said.
On the hotel front, SEMrush data uncovered that Google search volume for major global chains dropped, on 
average, by four percent from January to February. The hardest chains were Raffles Hotels & Resorts (-33 
percent), Choice Hotels (-19 percent); and Belmond Aman Resorts, Ritz-Carlton and Disney Resort Hotels, which 
were down by 18.5 percent.
"While search volumes for airlines are projected to recover in March, those for the major hotel chains are projected 
to decline even further in March by an industry average of 14.9 percent," SEMrush said.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Delta Air Lines DAL[1], American Airlines AAL[2], Ryanair Holdings 
RYAAY[3], Avianca Holdings AVH[4] and JetBlue Airways JBLU[5].Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog: 
Coronavirus Ravages Air Travel: Traffic Sinks to 2-Decade LowWith the coronavirus pandemic wrecking air-travel 
demand, the not-so-long-ago high-flying airlines have been brought to their knees across the globe. This is because 
passenger revenues, the largest component of their top line, took a gigantic hit from shriveled air-travel 
demand.Due to the spread of the coronavirus by geometric progression, blanket travel bans are imposed by 
governments across the globe. 
With several countries placed under lockdown, most people are debarred from taking trips in a bid to stay safe and 
avoid contracting the highly contagious disease from a fellow passenger.IATA's February Traffic Report: Reflection 
of a Sorry StatePer the International Air Transport Association (IATA), passenger traffic across the globe in 
February registered the steepest year-over-year decline in two decades. Notably, demand (measured in total 
revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) dropped 14.1% in the month on a year-over-year basis, signaling the 
sharpest monthly decrease since the dreaded 9/11 terror attacks on the United States back in 2001.With carriers 
across the globe cutting capacity to compensate the extremely low-demand scenario, overall capacity (available 
seat kilometers or ASKs) fell 8.7% in the second month of this year. With traffic decreasing at a faster rate than 
capacity reduction in the month, load factor (% of seats filled by passengers) contracted 4.8 percentage points to 
75.9%.In international passenger markets, demand deteriorated 10.1% in February on a year-over-year basis. With 
respect to international passenger demand, the level hit the nadir since the SARS outbreak in 2003. Demand for 
domestic travel dwindled 20.9% in the month mainly due to weakness in China's domestic traffic. This was because 
in February, China bore the worst brunt of the deadly coronavirus disease.Traffic Picture Likely to be Bleaker 
AheadWe expect the global traffic performance to have touched rock bottom in March given that the COVID-19 
outbreak was declared a pandemic by WHO in the month. With air-travel demand collapsing, the 
ZacksAirline[6]industry plummeted 52.4% in March.In fact, with the health hazard showing no signs of waning, air-
travel demand is likely to remain stressed atleast in the near term. Anticipating such a gloomy scene going forward, 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Delta Air Lines , American Airlines , Ryanair , Avianca and JetBlue Airways
the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Delta Air Lines warned that revenues in second-quarter 2020 (Apr-Jun period) are likely 
to be down 90% year over year. You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
here[7].Other U.S.-based carriers like American Airlines cancelled most of their flights due to the shrinkage in air-
travel demand as the pandemic continues to spread its tentacles across the globe, claiming multiple lives and 
infecting the global populace at large. The situation is exemplified by the European carrier Ryanair Holdings' 
anticipation that its fleet will remain mostly grounded through at least April and May. To combat the coronavirus-
induced 
threat, 
Latin 
American 
carriers 
like 
Avianca 
Holdings 
temporarily 
closed 
all 
passenger 
operations.ConclusionIATA's Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac rightly termed the current impasse as 
the 'biggest crisis that the industry has ever faced'. Due to the widespread flight cancellations, IATA projected 
airlines to burn up to $61 billion of their cash reserves during the second quarter of 2020.Passenger demand is 
likely to plunge71% in the Apr-Jun period. In fact, due to this suppressed demand, IATA anticipates airline 
passenger revenues, the largest component of their top line, to be dented by $252 billion in 2020.In fact, per OAG, 
provider of airline data and insight, airlines may have to wait until 2022 or 2023 to attract passengers at the level 
initially expected for the current year. Notably, JetBlue Airways' CEO Robin Hayes had warned last month that "the 
writing is on the wall" that travel demand cannot be restored anytime soon. Come what may, we expect investor 
focus to remain on this topical issue. To this end, we advise industry watchers to watch this space for more updates 
on the coronavirus overhang on air-travel and the airline industry's response to this standoff.Breakout Biotech

Travel companies should not halt marketing activity amid Covid-19
Travel companies should not halt marketing activity amid Covid-19
MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)

Section: AUTOMOTIVE, TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS
Length: 492 words
Highlight: Many travel companies have cut their entire marketing spend during Covid-19, which is detrimental in 
the long run.
Body
A recent survey from MMGY Travel Intelligence and Destinations found that 80% of destination organisations 
surveyed in North America have postponed sales and marketing efforts. Airbnb recently announced a pause on all 
marketing, saving $800m this year. Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary also stated that travel offers and 'seat sales' 
during the crisis are 'irresponsible'. With the effects upon the travel industry likely to be worse than the effects of 
9/11 and the 2008 recession combined, the industry needs to be prepared not only for current disruption, but also 
for the aftermath. 
With many factors of uncertainty around the pandemic, including the scale of impact and length, there is no doubt 
that the travel industry will be hit hard. Travel companies and destination market organisations (DMOs) need to 
have comprehensive plans to mitigate the impact. It could be very easy to cut all marketing costs while travel is not 
permitted, as the initial thought would be that it's not needed whilst 'lying low'. Nepal Tourism Board has officially 
ended its Visit Nepal 2020 campaign, which aimed to target two million foreign visitors, double the amount in 2019. 
Countries that have been the hardest hit by the pandemic, such as Italy and Spain will have to increase efforts to 
drive tourism again to these popular destinations. Their reputation as a safe destination may diminish, so DMOs 
need to increase effort in these tourism-dependent economies. Some DMOs have made viable efforts to maintain 
awareness of the destination during the pandemic. Visit Britain, Discover Puerto Rico and Visit Philly (Philadelphia, 
United States), are just a few examples of destinations offering virtual tours of the destination during the Covid-19 
crisis. Offering an experience which can be enjoyed whilst adhering to government travel restrictions is a fantastic 
idea, and is making the most of the current situation. As many source markets across the world are placed on 
countrywide lockdowns, with hospitality and retail venues closed, frequent travellers are currently at home, looking 
forward to travel again once the restrictions have been lifted. Evidence shows that travellers are still searching, and 
booking holidays for later on in the year, highlighting the need for marketing not to pause. Those who do not pause 
marketing spend will be well positioned to exploit the pent up demand. There needs to be a travel industry to return 
to. Cutting marketing spend completely will have a long-term detriment to their operations. If marketing spend was 
Travel companies should not halt marketing activity amid Covid-19
halved, then the impact on awareness would be much less even though costs would be saved. However, its ability 
to do so depends upon the travel companies' brand and market recognition. Reprioritising marketing channels at 
this time and creating a 'bounce back' marketing campaign for when the height has passed will aid companies and 
destinations in the long run when travellers are willing to travel again.

CEOs must turn their pay gestures into real reform
CEOs must turn their pay gestures into real reform

For decades, chief executives seemed to be paid according to two rules of thumb. First, they deserved to earn more 
than the average business leader. Second, their pay should never go down. Warren Buffett nicknamed the pay 
consultants who lubricated the remuneration merry-go-round "Ratchet, Ratchet & Bingo".
Covid-19 could reset these rules permanently. As chief executives take tough decisions about the salaries, jobs, 
and future of their staff, many are recognising that at the very least they too should be seen to suffer. They are still 
benchmarking against their peers. But now decisions are based as much on how much they should give back. as 
on how much they should take out.
Ana Botín, chairman of Santander, agreed to contribute half her pay to a medical equipment fund created by the 
Spanish bank. Michael O'Leary, abrasive chief executive of Ryanair, joined the airline's staff in taking a 50 per cent 
cut for April and May.
They are outliers. Many chief executives are sacrificing less. They are part of a growing "20 Per Cent Club" of 
bosses reducing their salaries by a fifth, while staff contemplate weeks in government-backed furlough schemes.
There are other differences. Lop 20 per cent off the median FTSE 100 chief's salary of £876,000 and he or she still 
takes home £60,000 a month before tax. Chief executives' pay-cut pledges are typically time-limited and their 
bonus and long-term incentive plans are mostly intact.
CEOs must turn their pay gestures into real reform
By contrast, UK furlough payments are capped at £2,500 a month. Workers are crashing down through the layers of 
Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs towards the lowest level where they have to focus on health and shelter. The 
UK charity Citizens Advice reported last month that in the first fortnight of the crisis, it fielded many requests for 
information about flight and hotel cancellations. Then came a wave of concern about sick pay, followed by requests 
for advice about redundancy and state benefits, and finally about how to cope with spiralling debt.
Another psychologist, Frederick Herzberg, observed that staff were more likely to grumble when they lost "hygiene 
factors" such as a decent wage and job security, rather than applaud when they were present. This crisis is a large-
scale test of that hypothesis, at a time when, for many workers, good hygiene is more than a mere metaphor.
It is good to see chief executives acknowledge the plight of staff. It makes a change from hearing them bracket 
themselves with some professional footballers, who have been slow to waive part of their galactically large wages, 
even as their clubs are tossing the minions who clean the stars' boots or cook their meals into furlough.
Xavier Baeten, who studies executive pay at Belgium's Vlerick Business School, says the trend differentiates this 
crisis from the financial meltdown of 2008, when only a minority of companies cut chief executives' pay. Regulators 
have already stepped in to warn banks to "exercise extreme moderation" on bonuses. But Prof Baeten notes that 
even companies that stand to do well during the pandemic have "a bad feeling" about being seen to reward 
executives too lavishly.
For now, though, I have a sense boards are doing the minimum necessary to shield themselves from reputational 
damage. The real proof of chief executives' appetite for sacrifice and solidarity will come as they emerge from the 
acute phase of the pandemic and consider whether to address the chronic problems with executive pay.
Some will argue they should be rewarded if they successfully lead their companies through the biggest threat to 
their survival since the second world war. Others will point out that in the same way that lavish remuneration in 
good times was a mere fraction of the value they could create for shareholders, cutting pay in bad times would not 
be enough to stave off calamity. There are limits, though.
Remuneration committees will have an important role in curbing unwarranted or unintended windfalls. Pay 
structures at most companies need simplifying. In a crisis, nobody really cares what the intricate inner workings of a 
watch look like as long as it tells the correct time. Incentives themselves need readjusting. Alex Edmans, an 
advocate for paying executives in restricted stock, argues in his new book Grow The Pie that reformers should aim 
to encourage leaders "to create longrun value for society, rather than reduce the level of pay".
In the UK at least, chief executives' pay had already plateaued before this crisis. But afterwards, remuneration will 
again be a lightning rod for public and political discontent. My hunch, and hope, is that this time chief executives will 
recognise how fragile trust in business is. By converting early goodwill gestures into permanent pay reform, they 
can work to shore it up.

damage. The real proof of chief executives' appetite for sacrifice and solidarity will come as they emerge from the 
acute phase of the pandemic and consider whether to address the chronic problems with executive pay.
Some will argue they should be rewarded if they successfully lead their companies through the biggest threat to 
their survival since the second world war. Others will point out that in the same way that lavish remuneration in 
good times was a mere fraction of the value they could create for shareholders, cutting pay in bad times would not 
be enough to stave off calamity. There are limits, though.
Remuneration committees will have an important role in curbing unwarranted or unintended windfalls. Pay 
structures at most companies need simplifying. In a crisis, nobody really cares what the intricate inner workings of a 
watch look like as long as it tells the correct time. Incentives themselves need readjusting. Alex Edmans, an 
advocate for paying executives in restricted stock, argues in his new book Grow The Pie that reformers should aim 
to encourage leaders "to create longrun value for society, rather than reduce the level of pay".
In the UK at least, chief executives' pay had already plateaued before this crisis. But afterwards, remuneration will 
again be a lightning rod for public and political discontent. My hunch, and hope, is that this time chief executives will 
recognise how fragile trust in business is. By converting early goodwill gestures into permanent pay reform, they 
can work to shore it up.

Ryanair will take an estimated (EURO)300m hit this year because of a wrong-way bet on fuel prices, which have 
plummeted over the past month.
The carrier warned yesterday that it expected to "record ineffectiveness" on its full-year 2021 fuel hedges as an 
exceptional item of about (EURO)300m in this year's results, ending March 31 2020.
Daniel Roeska, aviation analyst at Bernstein, said high levels of hedging were "working against the company". Cash 
would also be hit in the early part of Ryanair's 2021 financial year as spot prices below hedged prices meant 
payments to counterparties. It comes as the airline said it expected pre-exceptional profit for the year to be at the 
bottom end of its previous estimate, between (EURO)950m and (EURO)1bn.
Ryanair noted that traffic in March fell 48 per cent from 10.9m passengers in 2019 to 5.7m in 2020. This meant 
fullyear traffic would rise just 4 per cent to 149m, down from the forecast 154m figure the airline said it was on track 
to achieve even as late as early March.
The airline industry is battling one of its biggest crises in decades, which has led to fleets being grounded and 
carriers turning to the state for support.
Iata, the trade body, this week warned that airlines were facing an "enormous cash problem"; they were expected to 
burn through $61bn of their cash reserves during the second quarter.
Ryanair set for (EURO)300m hit after wrong-way fuel bet; News round-up
British Airways on Thursday announced plans to furlough more than 30,000 of its 40,000 staff, while parent IAG 
said it would cancel its final dividend as it took moves to bolster cash. Ryanair is running fewer than 20 daily flights, 
down 99 per cent from its normal schedule of more than 2,500.
Mr Roeska said Ryanair had one of the strongest balance sheets and "highest levels of liquidity in the industry".
He said: "In our view the company could last possibly until around the end of the calendar year on current 
resources."
Ryanair yesterday reiterated its strong balance sheet, pointing to yearend cash equivalents of (EURO)3.8bn, and 
said that 77 per cent of its fleet, equivalent to 327 planes, was unencumbered and debt-free.

Apr 03, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  KEY POINTSIn 
March Ryanair's traffic plunged by 48% to 5.7 million passengersThe carrier expects its fleet to be grounded at 
least through the end of MayRyanair is currently operating less than 20 daily flights Irish-based budget airline 
Ryanair[1] said it expects to report an after-tax profit between €950 million ($1.025 billion) and €1 billion ($1.08 
billion) for the fiscal year ended Mar. 31.In fiscal 2019, Ryanair posted a similar profit of€1.02 billion ($1.1 
billion)Results in2020 for the low-cost carrier will fall at the lower range of prior guidance issued in January to 
account for the effects of the coronavirus epidemic that has led the airline to ground most of its fleet.In March (the 
final month of the fiscal year), Ryanair's traffic plunged by 48% to 5.7 million passengers - down from 10.9 million 
passengers in March 2019 -- due to extensive flight bans and travel restrictions across Europe.For the full fiscal 
year, however, traffic rose by 4% to 149 million passengers - although that figure fell short of the 154 million 
passengers the airline had hoped for.For now, the carrier expects its fleet to be grounded at least through the end 
of May.Ryanair also estimated it will take an exceptional charge of about €300 million ($324 million) due to the 
ineffectiveness of its fuel hedging practices for this year, given that oil prices have cratered to as low as $20 per 
barrel (The net profit estimate includes this charge). Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, is currently 
operating less[2] than 20 daily flights -- a 99% plunge from its pre-coronavirus schedule of more than 2,500 daily 
flights.Ryanair has also enacted various cost-cutting measures to deal with the expected loss of revenue. 
'These include aircraft groundings, deferring [capital expenditures], suspending share buybacks, freezing 
recruitment and discretionary spending, cutting all pay (including senior management) by 50% with immediate effect 
for April and May,' the carrier said. 'We are engaging with our people and our unions across all EU countries to 
agree [to] payroll support mechanisms as they are put in place by EU governments.'Ryanair further noted that it is 
'grateful to many EU governments for their foresight and speed of response in recognizing that the EU airlines are 
one of the most exposed industries to the COVID-19 pandemic.'But Ryanair warned that large bailouts of airlines by 
some European governments might disrupt competition. It added that it supports 'the EU Commission's position that 
any such government [financial] supports must comply with all EU state aid and competition rules.'Due to the 
continuing uncertainties of the current crisis, Ryanair added that it could not provide earnings guidance for the 
coming financial year.Ryanair 'will continue to focus on delivering cost savings, protecting jobs, working with EU 
governments to support rescue and medical flights, and preparing for the return to normal service when the COVID-
19 crisis has passed,' it said.The company will release its full year results on May 18.While many airlines in the U.K. 
and Europe have asked for - or are in talks for - government bailouts, Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary[3] 
Ryanair Forecasts $1 Billion Net Profit For Fiscal 2020, Including Fuel Hedging Charge
claimed his carrier could survive on its cash without any flights or revenue for up to a year.'The priority here for us 
as a company is how do we preserve as much cash so that if we have to operate for three, six, nine, maybe even 
12 months, with no flights and no revenues how do we survive that, do we have the cash to survive that and we 
believe we do,' O'Leary told Financial Times.On Friday, Ryanair said it has one 'of the strongest balance sheets in 
the industry,' with year-end cash equivalents of €3.8 billion [$4.1 billion] and that 327, or 77%, of its owned fleet is 
unencumbered and debt free. [ 1]: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/ryanair-expects-to-

       U.K. stocks fell sharply on Friday and remained on track for their fifth weekly decline in six as coronavirus 
cases continued to rise and a survey of business leaders showed that U.K. manufacturing output and new orders 
have declined at the fastest rate in eight years in March, due to the pandemic.
 The benchmark FTSE 100 was down 65 points, or 1.2 percent, at 5,412 after gaining half a percent the previous 
day.
 Insurer Aviva fell 4.6 percent, Prudential slumped 6 percent and Legal &General; Group lost as much as 10 
percent after the EU regulator asked insurers and reinsurers to temporarily suspend dividends and share buybacks.
 Information services provider Ascential declined 7.4 percent after scrapping its 2019 dividend and saying it was 
commercially not viable to run the Cannes Lions Festival this year.
 Associated British Foods fell over 2 percent. The company said George Weston, Chief Executive, and John Bason, 
Finance Director, have requested that their base pay be reduced temporarily by 50 percent. 
 Ryanair Holdings edged down slightly after its group traffic for the month of March declined 48 percent.
 Sainsbury rose over 1 percent. The supermarket chain said it will start to remove the customer purchasing limits 
from Sunday. Previously, the retailer imposed the limits as a response to increased demand during the coronavirus 
pandemic.
 BAE Systems was down 2.6 percent. The defense firm will defer its dividend as it sees significant disruptions from 
the virus outbreak.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) said pre-market Friday that it expects to report FY2020 profit after tax of between 
EUR950 million to EUR1 billion ($1.03 billion to $1.08 billion) which is at the lower end of its prior guidance range of 
EUR950 million to EUR1.5 billion primarily due to widespread travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic.
March traffic declined by 48% to 5.7 million passengers from 10.9 million in the same month last year. Full year 
traffic is up just 4% to 149 million passengers, according to the Irish budget carrier.
The company also said that it cannot currently provide FY2021 guidance due to prevailing uncertainty from the 
global health crisis.

 Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L) expects to post a profit after tax for the fiscal year ended March of 950 million euros to 1 
billion euros ($1.03 billion to $1.08 billion) , which is at the lower end of its guidance range, due to disruptions 
caused by COVID-19.
The Irish budget airline said Friday that traffic plummeted 48% year over year to 5.7 million guests in March amid 
widespread flight bans and travel restrictions across the European Union.
Ryanair said it is operating less than 20 daily flights, or 99% less than its daily schedule before the pandemic. It 
anticipates its fleet to remain mostly grounded for at least April and May,  with an exceptional charge of roughly 300 
million euros.
The airline reported a profit after tax of 885 million euros in fiscal 2019.
Ryanair added it is unable to provide a fiscal 2021 guidance given the continued uncertainty on the pandemic's 
impact and duration.

       Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Friday said its group traffic for the month of March declined 48 percent 
to 5.7 million passengers from last year's 10.9 million passengers. The decline was due to airspace closure amid 
coronavirus or Covid-19 CRISIS. The load factor was 91 percent.
 Ryanair operated over 33,000 scheduled flights in March, compared to 64,000 budgeted. The March flights 
included a number of rescue and medical flights on behalf of various EU Govts.
 Specifically, Ryanair traffic fell 48 percent to 5.5 million guests with 91 percent load factor, and Lauda traffic 
declined 50 percent to 0.2 million guests, with 91 percent load factor.
 Due to widespread EU Govt flight bans and restrictions, Ryanair expects to carry minimal if any traffic during the

Apr 03, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  With the coronavirus 
pandemic crippling air-travel demand, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported a 48% year-
over-year decline in March traffic to 5.7 million guests. Additionally, in view of the widespread travel restrictions in 
place due to the outbreak, Ryanair's traffic for fiscal 2020 (ended Mar 31, 2020) improved a mere 4% year over 
year to 149 million. Notably, the carrier was on track to achieve traffic of 154 million even as late as in early 
March.As a result of this adversity, Ryanair expects fiscal 2020 Profit After Tax in the €950 million-€1,000 million 
range (which is at the lower end of the earlier expected range). The company will release its fiscal 2020 results on 
May 18. The carrier expects to record an exceptional charge of €300 million in its fiscal 2020 results.With flights 
mainly operating for rescue and medical purposes, Ryanair currently runs less than 20 flights per day, representing 
a massive 99% reduction from the 2,500 plus flights that took to the skies daily prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.With 
the situation showing no signs of subsiding, Ryanair anticipates its fleet to remain mostly grounded through at least 
April and May. 
With revenues being severely hit, Ryanair undertook several cost-cutting measures to drive its bottom line. The 
same includes deferring capital expenditures, freezing recruitment, trimming pay for April and May by half and 
pushing back discretionary spending. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) carrier suspended share buybacks. Due to 
the coronavirus-led crisis, shares of Ryanair have dropped 29.7% in the past month.You can seethe complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[2].The coronavirus outbreak has not only affected Ryanair's 
operations but also other airlines across the globe. With demand collapsing exponentially, carriers are trimming 
their capacity levels drastically. Evidently, the Chicago-based United Airlines UAL[3] slashed its April capacity by 
60% with further cuts anticipated in May and June.Notably, the chaos brought about by this pandemic hit other 
corners of the Zacks Transportation [4]sector as well. Recently, major railroad operators, namely Union Pacific 
Corporation UNP[5] and Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC[6] warned that the pandemic could have a material 
adverse impact on their results.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special

Banks need to keep their staff bonuses under a tight lockdown
Banks need to keep their staff bonuses under a tight lockdown

The governor of the Bank of England did more than wiggle his eyebrows at lenders this week. He, or rather his 
bank regulation deputy, told British banks to hold off paying dividends and cash bonuses to top staff over the next 
few months.
The banks are complying, at least with the request to cut dividends. They are less forthcoming about how they will 
adjust bonuses. Contrast that with Taylor Wimpey, which said yesterday there would be no cash bonuses for 
executives in 2020.
Well over a dozen publicly listed companies, from Ryanair to Capita, have broadcast cuts to executive pay and 
rations this year.
Lender Standard Chartered has murmured about updating the market later on remuneration. Its financial sector 
peers are keeping schtum.
However, most UK banks whose year ended in December notified staff of their bonuses in February. Almost all 
shelled out what cash they were due to pay - excluding the high proportion of deferred bonuses - in March. The 
next cash payments are due in 11 months.
Who knows what profits will look like then? A year is a long time in a coronavirus world.
Banks need to keep their staff bonuses under a tight lockdown
Traders have had a good first quarter. FX teams have been working their white socks off trading the volatility in 
markets.
On the other hand, retail banking is suffering and M&A bankers are twiddling their thumbs. That may change in the 
second half as companies restructure and refinance.
Since the banking crisis of 2008, regulators in Europe and the US have persistently called for banks to trim and 
defer variable awards or pay them in shares. Last week Sheila Bair, former chair of the US Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, opined in the FT that banks should snip discretionary bonuses, as well as dividends and 
buybacks, to free up the trillions of additional lending capacity and absorb the huge losses on bad debts that are 
heading the industry's way.
Are regulators fighting the last war? Banks are far stronger now than in 2008 when the taxpayer bailed them out. 
They have been shoring up their capital buffers for nearly a decade.
Nonetheless, remuneration is a lagoon-sized cost for banks. Variable pay accounted for nearly half of Barclays' 
total remuneration costs of £1.3bn in 2019.
About half of the bill was in cash. It would be an error for banks to jeopardise the strength by repeating the mistakes 
of the noughties.
This will go down as the year of widespread corporate failure and the biggest central bank-taxpayer intervention in 
the economy since the second world war.
Under this new compact, banks have a societal role as agents of the government, transmitting state aid to small 
enterprises and individuals as unemployment rises and recession looms.
They must not forfeit the high ground by raining rewards on staff after other stakeholders have suffered so much.

Airline fuelling strategies: can more be done to save carbon and cut costs?
Airline fuelling strategies: can more be done to save carbon and cut costs?

Highlight: Fuel typically accounts for between 17% and 25% of an airline's operating costs. The volatile nature of 
its price, however, and rising competition in the industry are making this necessity even costlier for airlines. The 
situation is forcing them to cut down expenses, often to the detriment of the environment, as a recent BBC 
Panorama investigation found.
Body
Published in November 2019, it exposed the likes of British Airways (BA) and easyJet for their so-called 'fuel 
tankering' practices, which involve loading aircraft with excess fuel to save up costs. According to a recent study by 
Eurocontrol, despite saving airlines an estimated $265m per year, this practice is also responsible for an extra 
901,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year - the equivalent of 2,800 round-trips between Paris and New York. Days 
after the BBC investigation, BA announced it would carry out a review of the model and look at changing its 
refuelling behaviour in the future. But with expenses already reaching their peak, switching to sustainable 
operations will come at an even higher cost for the industry. With public pressure increasing on the one hand, and 
global competition tightening on the other, aviation stakeholders share their insights on what can be done to 
improve flight efficiency. 
Sustainable fuelling and fuel-saving measures do existAs the International Air Transport Association (IATA) 
explains, sustainable fuelling strategies are already available on the market. Through its Technical Fuel Group, the 
organisation encourages best practices on fuel efficiency through the industry, launching initiatives such as the 
Global Fuel Portal and offering a platform for companies to discuss future moves. "Hydrant systems provide the 
most efficient means of delivering fuel to the gates," explains Technical Fuel Group vice-chair Seth Dillon. 
"Combined with stationary carts the carbon footprint becomes almost zero for this final phase of refuelling. In 
addition, he says, "by continuing to allow fuelling with passengers/crew on-board [an airline is] able to minimise 
aircraft ground time, [...] provided there is adequate ground support equipment available". As per Eurocontrol's 
report, another option for airlines aiming to avoid fuel tankering is to be "fully fuel hedged at a unique price at all 
airports at which they operate, which some of them already aim at doing as much as possible". A tool that has 
recently been gaining traction in the industry, fuel hedging is a practice whereby airlines - Ryanair being a prime 
example - agree to purchase fuel at a pre-established price to protect themselves from cost fluctuations. Finally, the 
Airline fuelling strategies: can more be done to save carbon and cut costs?
paper reports, "another option would be to increase the cost of CO2 allowances to a dissuasive level, or potentially 
equalise the tax rates on fuel". Who is responsible for choosing different fuelling strategies?Decisions around the 
efficient use of fuel and fuelling strategies are made by several different stakeholders. "Optimising the amount of 
fuel required for a flight involves many complex calculations that depend on the flight path, speed, altitude, weight 
and various factors," says Dan White, CEO and co-founder of Signol, a start-up that is applying behavioural science 
to save aviation fuel. "Airlines typically use flight planning software to take care of these calculations." Echoing his 
words, Dillon explains that ensuring efficient flying "starts long before the pilot boards the aircraft". For example, 
loading and routing planning is performed by dispatchers, meteorologists, load planners and more. "Engineers at 
original equipment manufacturers and airlines work to develop the most cost-effective way to fly the aircraft from 
reduced power take-off and climb, to optimum cruise altitudes to continuous descent approaches, all combined to 
minimise fuel burn," he continues. "The real savings are realised by the planning done in advance of every flight." 
However, White claims that the ultimate decision "lies with the pilot, who performs their own sets of calculations 
using their professional judgements with safety and timing in mind". Through these calculations, pilots can already 
adopt a number of fuel-saving techniques before, during and after the flight. These include reducing the number of 
engines during taxiing, as well as the continuous descent approach (CDA), which involves keeping the aircraft at 
cruise altitude when approaching a destination to then start off a continuous descent - in opposition to the 
traditionally more polluting step down approach. These methods may well have scope for improvement, but White 
says that pilots rarely have the capacity to implement them altogether. For example, he explains, "turning off one or 
more engines when taxiing to the gate is only possible when the taxi-in duration is longer than the engine cool-down 
time". Technology can make the differenceAs White explains, airport and traffic controllers can make a substantial 
difference in supporting the adoption of these techniques. In these regards, Helsinki Airport is leading by example, 
as its environmental permit is conditional on achieving a high number of aircraft employing CDA when landing at an 
airport. The hub's goal is to have 70% of aircraft using CDA per day and 80% at night. In addition, the digital age is 
providing more and more computer-based solutions that pilots and airlines can use to change their behaviours 
when it comes to fuel efficiency. One example is CAVU Companies' tankering calculator, a tool included in its EFB-
Pro iPad app, which performs runway calculations. The technology is designed to measure savings for a one-leg 
trip, as well as take-off weight, temperature, speed and destination fuel prices. Meanwhile, competitor Specific 
Range Solutions' AvFuelSaver app also analyses return trips, comparing the costs of tankering fuel and uploading it 
for each leg. Singol's platform also inserts itself in this market, having been designed to use personalised feedback 
and optimal management practices to make pilots more eager to consume less fuel. The idea is the result of a trial 
carried out in collaboration with Virgin Atlantic in 2014. As part of the study, says White, Signol "provided pilots with 
consistent performance feedback on fuel-efficient tasks", including showing them the proportion of flights for which 
actual fuel use was less than planned. The conclusion of the tests, which ran for eight months, is that this type of 
feedback can positively affect pilot behaviour and lead to improved fuel efficiency. "Overall, the project saved Virgin 
Atlantic 24,000 metric tonnes in fuel (or $6.1m at 2014 fuel prices)," explains White. So, "for each tonne of CO2 
abated, the airline received a private saving of $250." This gave scope to the development of a wider, personalised 
performance tracker, feedback and reporting software. As it works to test the feasibility of its app version, the 
platform is also extended to managers. "During usability testing, we found that managers wanted a tool for running 
flight analysis to find correlations between behavioural factors and fuel usage," explains White. This has paved the 
way for a system that allows managers to identify behavioural factors related to waste while preserving captains' 
privacy. "Managers can also use the platform to create fuel efficiency and impact reports related to behavioural 
correlations, with a view of taking the insights to implement fleet-wide efficiency incentives," he concludes.

Within two years, air passengers will have largely forgotten the current crisis and be back to flying as normal, the 
chief executive of European low-cost carrier Wizz Air has predicted.
Speaking to the Financial Times, Jozsef Varadi said that what "today looks like a huge concern, a life changing 
moment, in a year or two nobody remembers", and outlined plans for Wizz Air ramp back up to roughly 80% of 
capacity by September.
Varadi added that he expects national travel restrictions to ease in May and June, at which point Wizz would seek 
to boost the market with cheap tickets.
Wizz's main rival, Ryanair, also expects a quick recovery and also wants to reintroduce 80% of flights by 
September, although the Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has indicated that the airline would not fly if it had to leave 
middle seats empty.
Varadi told the FT that it would be possible to observe social distancing on aircraft in the initial months of services 
resuming due to anticipated lower demand.
Both Wizz Air and Ryanair expect to pick up market share from carriers wounded by the crisis.
It is unclear whether Varadi's confident outlook applies to the global market or just the stage lengths that Wizz 
typically offers, although most analysts expect short- and medium-haul flying to recover before the long-haul 
market.

COVID: Fitch downgrades Ryanair

Body
Fitch Ratings has downgraded Ryanair's long-term issuer default rating (IDR) and Ryanair's senior unsecured rating 
to BBB from BBB+. The outlook on the long-term issuer default rating is negative.
The downgrade reflects the rating agency's updated macroeconomic and global aviation industry expectations, 
which include a weakening of the Irish carrier's business and financial profile over the entire rating horizon.
In Fitch's baseline forecast, a deep global recession in 2020 will affect air travel demand well beyond the ongoing 
restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic.
The agency now assumes that Ryanair's revenue will only recover to the level of fiscal year 2019/20 during fiscal 
year 2023, leaving financial leverage weak for the previous rating level.
Fitch believes that Ryanair's liquidity will drain during fiscal year 2021, but will remain sufficient, assuming 
substantial measures to preserve cash.
Fitch assumes the carrier's seat capacity will fall 100% from April to the end of June before a slow recovery during 
the second half of 2020 and beyond. As a result, the rating agency anticipates an annual decline in scheduled 
available seat miles compared with fiscal year 2020 of 60% in fiscal year 2021 and 13% in fiscal year 2022, 
followed by 4% growth in fiscal year 2023 (compared with fiscal year 2020).
Load factor is predicted to drop to 89% in fiscal year 2021 (fiscal year 2020: 96%) and then gradually recover to 
91% by fiscal year 2023.
Fitch expects capital expenditure to reduce to (EURO)700 million ($764 million) in fiscal year 2021 but rise to 
(EURO)1.6 billion in fiscal year 2022. No share buybacks are anticipated between fiscal years 2021 and 2023.
The rating agency believes Ryanair is well placed to benefit from a post-pandemic sector recovery compared with 
most European peers. This is due to the company's solid financial profile at the outset of the crisis and its low cost 
base, which provide an opportunity to grow, particularly as some financially weaker airlines are likely to cease 
operations as a result of the crisis.
COVID: Fitch downgrades Ryanair
Fitch also affirmed the company's short-term issuer default rating at F2, reflecting the airline's conservative financial 
policy, strong liquidity and financial flexibility - given that 77% of the company's owned fleet is unencumbered and 
debt-free.
It also expects Ryanair to have access to short-term funding schemes provided by European central banks.

Ryanair 2020 profit remains within guidance
Ryanair 2020 profit remains within guidance

Ryanair expects to achieve a profit after tax of between (EURO)950 million and (EURO)1 billion ($1 billion - $1.06 
billion) in 2020 despite the recent paralysis of its operations created by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
This is at the lower end of its previously announced guidance range.
The Irish airline said that as a result of it grounding 99% of its pre-Covid 19 daily schedule of over 2,500 flights, it 
expected to incur a (EURO)300 million charge due to the "ineffectiveness" of its 2021 fuel hedges in its 2020 
results.
The low-cost carrier saw March traffic fall by 48% from 11 million in 2019 to 5.7 million in 2020. This caused full-
year traffic to rise just 4% to 149 million, compared with the 154 million that Ryanair thought it was on track to 
achieve until as late as early March.
The airline said it has "one of the strongest" balance sheets in the industry, with year-end cash equivalents of 
(EURO)3.8 billion and 77% of its owned fleet - 327 aircraft - unencumbered and debt free.
The airline has implemented a series of measures to cut operating costs, improve liquidity and cash flows. These 
include aircraft groundings, deferring Capex, suspending share buybacks, freezing recruitment and discretionary 
spending, and cutting all pay (including senior management) by 50% with immediate effect for April and May.

Europe's major airlines could survive for one year or more without seeking government bailouts if they can halve 
their monthly costs and raise financing against their unencumbered assets, analysts at Credit Suisse have 
calculated.
If Air France-KLM, Easyjet, IAG and Lufthansa reduced monthly costs by 50% and either sold and leased back 
assets or raised cash against them, they could avoid governments "writing large cheques" to bail them out, a 
research note by Neil Glynn, Arthur Truslove and Hannah Burrows stated.
Under this scenario, Air France-KLM would see days of financial coverage go from 69 to 95 before it would need to 
tap new sources of asset financing.
Utilising its unencumbered assets could generate nearly one year's cushion without needing additional unsecured 
capital.
Easyjet would see days coverage go from 73 to 94, while utilising its unencumbered assets could generate more 
than two years' cushion without needing additional unsecured capital.
IAG's financial coverage would rise from 147 to 187 days, while utilising its unencumbered assets could generate 
around 15 months' cushion.
Lufthansa would see days coverage go from 25 to 32 before it taps new sources, with or without selling assets. 
Utilising its unencumbered assets could generate around 18 months' cushion without the need for additional 
unsecured capital.
Ryanair is best placed in this regard: cutting monthly costs by 50% would see its coverage rise from 342 days to 
454 days.
The bank said moves by airlines to reduce or delay their capital expenditure (Capex) plans are now "imperative", 
but by utilising their unencumbered assets, even these are "absorbable".
Post-coronavirus (Covid-19), European airlines may find themselves having to hold up to 40% of annual revenues 
in cash to absorb future crises.
COVID : European airlines can stretch liquidity to years - Credit Suisse
The bank says it sees a "strong rationale" for the introduction of supervisory boards, and potentially even 
regulators/governments introducing "minimum liquidity buffers".
The Credit Suisse note ponders on the potential for the crisis to push up the cost of equity for airlines.

[Re: Airline bailouts] Press reports suggest that some airlines are asking for a government bailout. Aviation 
consultancy CAPA has recently warned that the entire airline industry will be bust in a few months. The industry 
requires new shareholder equity, not just cheap loans, to make good the current cash-burn . Using British 
taxpayers' money to prioritise the rescue of the largely foreign owned UK industry would be morally reprehensible at 
a time when small British businesses - whose owners live in Britain and have paid their taxes - are in crisis.
Capital markets are still functioning well enough to look through the current turmoil and be prepared to back airlines 
with better business models such as British Airways owner IAG or Ryanair. But there will be one important condition 
attached: that weaker competitors be allowed to go out of business so that the survivors can enjoy the spoils of 
victory.
We have been short Norwegian Air Shuttle for the past five years whilst it has pressed ahead with gung-ho 
expansion funded by reckless levels of debt. Its legacy providers of capital should now face their day of reckoning.
Renowned American investor Warren Buffett once remarked: "Investors have poured their money into airlines for 
100 years with terrible results. It's been a death trap for investors". Let the buyer beware. Caveat Emptor!
The government would be better letting capital markets decide which publicly quoted airlines can regain their wings 
or alternatively remain permanently grounded.

Norwegian, Alitalia, LOT Polish Airlines and TAP Portugal are among the carriers most at risk of collapse as a result 
of the coronavirus crisis, while the big low-cost carriers (LCCs) will be the "winners", according to analysis by 
Goodbody. Norwegian, Alitalia, TAP, LOT, Condor, Ukraine International Airlines and Tarom are all at risk either 
because of their "comparatively" weak balance sheets or a dependence on governments, "whose budgets are 
going to be substantially strained from supporting their economies over the next few years", the Goodbody analysts 
stated.
The combined capacity of these airlines accounts for 9.5% of intra-European capacity - or 103 million seats - as 
recorded over the 12 months to end March.
Europe's largest LCCs - Wizz Air, Easyjet and Ryanair - will emerge from the "carnage" of 2020 as the winners from 
the crisis, Goodbody analysts Mark Simpson and Nuala McMahon believe.
While they will post a combined net loss of (EURO)2.1 billion ($2.25 billion) in 2020, this is then expected to flip by 
FY22 to a combined profit of (EURO)2.7 billion, helped in part by favourable jet fuel prices.
Goodbody said all three airlines have strong liquidity to weather the crisis. All are exposed to the negative impact of 
fuel hedging positions, but can lock in more favourable rates for future consumption.
One of the "real surprises" in the early days of this crisis is the extent to which airlines have been able to cut their 
fixed costs, for instance by encouraging staff to take unpaid leave, pay cuts or to participate in the furlough 
schemes offered by various European governments, the analysts said.
This has translated, by their estimates, to an average of 75% variable, 25% fixed costs during the grounding of the 
main LCC fleets, as opposed to a more traditional 63/37 split when one considers fuel and airport/navigation 
charges as variable costs.
Easyjet and Wizz have no debts due in 2020, while Ryanair's debt maturity in 2021 is only (EURO)483 million.
Based on previous global crises and resulting airline bankruptcies, Goodbody forecasts that the big LCCs could 
pick up 4.3% of European market share as a result of Covid-19.
COVID: Big European LCCs to emerge as crisis 'winners'
Once the immediate crisis is over, Goodbody expects Easyjet and Wizz to make changes to their capital 
expenditure (Capex) programmes to shore up liquidity into 2022.
It estimates that Wizz needs (EURO)770 million to purchase aircraft in that year. "As such, we think Wizz will likely 
defer the start of its [Airbus] A321neo ownership programme until FY23," it stated.
Goodbody believes Easyjet will need £623 million ($666 million) of liquidity by the end of 2022. This could be met 
through the issuance of more commercial paper or the airline could increase its sale and leaseback transactions.

Bosses who claim "we're all in this together" before taking a pay rise are asking for trouble. Coronavirus is 
multiplying job losses and diminishing tolerance towards corporate fat cattery.
In the eurozone, big bonuses for bankers will invite retribution from the ECB. In the UK, pandemic profiteers face an 
even more terrifying nemesis: tabloid media.
How should boards respond? Lex has extracted some ground rules on pay from recent company announcements. 
These should help businesses avoid redtop denunciations and Twitter storms. Most groups are limiting solidarity 
pay cuts to the crisis period. That is common sense. Reductions can always be rolled forward in a recession. The 
size of the discount varies widely. The rationale for taking a cut increases in proportion to the pain suffered by the 
workforce or the group's dependence on state support. One-tenth looks like the minimum. There is no ceiling: some 
bosses have waived pay entirely. The unreliable average hovers somewhere in between.
Macy's boss Jeff Gennette will receive no pay from April until the crisis ends. The US retailer announced this week 
it would furlough the majority of its 125,000 workers. Michael O'Leary at Irish low-cost airline Ryanair cut his pay in 
half, the same as his staff. At the other end of the spectrum, executives at Thai Airways - lossmaking since 2016 - 
have offered "voluntary" reductions of 15-25 per cent.
Salary cuts of about 50 per cent have publicity value. But PRs should brace themselves for snarky questions on 
incentive schemes and other trimmings. Salary is only about a tenth of full remuneration in the US. The average 
pay package of an S&P 500 chief executive has risen by half to just over $12m since the financial crisis, largely 
thanks to extras.

Many CEOs are absorbing huge stresses while working long hours in businesses flirting with collapse. There may

Even so, non-execs, natural proponents of collective responsibility, must have that conversation swiftly.

job of non-executive directors, is tough during a lockdown.
Many CEOs are absorbing huge stresses while working long hours in businesses flirting with collapse. There may 
be no "good time" to tell them they should receive less for doing more.
Even so, non-execs, natural proponents of collective responsibility, must have that conversation swiftly.

Bosses who claim "we're all in this together" before taking a pay rise are asking for trouble. Coronavirus is 
multiplying job losses and diminishing tolerance towards corporate fat cattery.
In the eurozone, big bonuses for bankers will invite retribution from the ECB. In the UK, pandemic profiteers face an 
even more terrifying nemesis: tabloid media.
How should boards respond? Lex has extracted some ground rules on pay from recent company announcements. 
These should help businesses avoid redtop denunciations and Twitter storms. Most groups are limiting solidarity 
pay cuts to the crisis period. That is common sense. Reductions can always be rolled forward in a recession. The 
size of the discount varies widely. The rationale for taking a cut increases in proportion to the pain suffered by the 
workforce or the group's dependence on state support. One-tenth looks like the minimum. There is no ceiling: some 
bosses have waived pay entirely. The unreliable average hovers somewhere in between.
Macy's boss Jeff Gennette will receive no pay from April until the crisis ends. The US retailer announced this week 
it would furlough the majority of its 125,000 workers. Michael O'Leary at Irish low-cost airline Ryanair cut his pay in 
half, the same as his staff. At the other end of the spectrum, executives at Thai Airways - lossmaking since 2016 - 
have offered "voluntary" reductions of 15-25 per cent.
Salary cuts of about 50 per cent have publicity value. But PRs should brace themselves for snarky questions on 
incentive schemes and other trimmings. Salary is only about a tenth of full remuneration in the US. The average 
pay package of an S&P 500 chief executive has risen by half to just over $12m since the financial crisis, largely 
thanks to extras.

Follow the latest updates of theÂ outbreakÂ on ourÂ timeline. Ireland's Cork Airport has reduced its operations 
amid the Covid-19 pandemic and is operating flights to repatriate stranded Irish citizens from other countries. The 
management of the airport added that the evacuation flights are being operated by Aer Lingus and Ryanair. 
The airport is also open to facilitate emergency landings, medical evacuations and all necessary non-commercial 
flights such as connectivity with Ireland's offshore gas network. Cork Airport managing director Niall MacCarthy 
said: "We are operating a much-reduced service at present and are flexing our hours of operation to suit essential 
service needs given the global downturn in aviation in recent weeks. "Our staff across all departments have done a 
tremendous job in extremely challenging circumstances to support the national efforts in this unprecedented crisis." 
The airport has requested passengers to verify the status of the flights departing from Cork Airport. The Covid-19 
pandemic has so far infected more than 787,000 people and killed over 37,800 around the world. The Republic of 
Ireland has reported 2,910 confirmed cases and 54 deaths. On 30 March, a flight carrying 100 Irish citizens who 
were stranded in Peru landed at Dublin Airport. The flight was facilitated by the Irish Government and it is reported 
that the passengers will have to pay 400 for the flight. Earlier this month, Dublin Airport and Cork Airport announced 
plans to reduce their operations due to the reduced passenger traffic caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The airport 
operator daa stated that the continuation of operations in the airports will depend on the country's travel policies 
related to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as airline operations and other travel restrictions associated with 
overseas markets.

D ubliners Chris and Patricia O'Hara have had plenty of time to contemplate the "mess" of their Italian retirement 
plans since Ireland's general shutdown to halt the spread of coronavirus on March 12.
So far, they have spent (EURO)42,000 on a rundown farmhouse in Puglia, southern Italy, which they hope will 
eventually be a yoga retreat and art school. Their offer of (EURO)190,000 was accepted in November and they 
have paid a 10 per cent deposit to the Milanese property owners.
"We are due to complete on July 1 but now we don't know what will happen," says Chris, an artist.
"We don't want to bother the elderly owners in Lombardy right now, but we are not sure whether we are going to be 
in a position to proceed. We've had to close our businesses in Ireland for now. We are also worried whether 
Ryanair will survive so that we won't even be able to fly there [Brindisi] and whether Italian property prices will 
plummet."
The O'Haras are far from alone in having committed to buying a property abroad and now being uncertain of their 
ability (or desire) to complete as scheduled in their contracts. The situation is changing daily in many areas, but 
agents, lawyers and notaries are finding new ways of working around an unprecedented situation.
Could corona stop your deal?; International property | In the midst of buying overseas? Don't despair - much 
can be done digitally during the pandemic crisis. B....
So where do buyers stand? I need to buy a home but can I view properties? In Spain, physical property viewings 
are not permitted until the state of emergency ends. In France, the situation is similar until the 15-day lockdown 
finishes. "However, we are still getting many inquiries so we can do virtual tours or video viewings and talk through 
with clients on the phone," says Joanna Leggett of Leggett Immobilier, an agency in France.
This is happening across markets that are not completely restricted, says Hugo Thistlethwayte, head of Savills. "We 
are still open for business in many areas, if working under strict conditions. Even physical viewings are happening - 
in parts of the Caribbean and Miami - if all parties are willing."
In Florida, none of the current restrictions are affecting a buyer's ability to purchase a home - apart from flying out to 
see properties, of course - says Zoe Attwood of Homes of America Realty Group. Her company is conducting 
viewings with a British couple looking to buy a villa in Orlando, a search made urgent since their flight home to 
Manchester has been cancelled.
Purchases are still proceeding, she says, as the title company (that manages the conveyancing process in the US) 
will work with the buyer and either mail or email the documents that they need to sign to the buyer. British buyers 
can then sign the documents before a UK notary (assuming they can travel to see one).
If you are in the process of agreeing the sale of your home, use a flexible completion date, says Alex Radford, an 
English-born Marbella-based solicitor at My Lawyer in Spain.
"There needs to be a clause inserted that states 'completion will be by 'x' date or earlier by agreement or later if the 
parties or their legal representatives cannot attend completion due to Covid-19 crisis,'" he says. "At the moment we 
are suggesting a future completion date of at least two months."
My sale has been agreed but I am not sure we will be able to proceed Since sterling has plummeted and 
businesses have closed, many British buyers across Europe are re-evaluating purchases.
But what about if deposits have already been paid? Tim Hughes, a solicitor in Lyon, is working with British cash 
buyers who, since committing to buy a home, have lost money on the stock market that had been earmarked for the 
purchase.
They will now need to apply for a bank loan or find other sources of funding to complete, he says. But if they fail to 
do so and have to pull out, they will likely lose their deposit (5 per cent across France, 10 per cent in Paris), 
because they did not have a typical "safety-net" clause that allows buyers to pull out if they cannot secure a 
mortgage.
"Completion dates in France are a target, not a deadline, and there is no sanction [as there is in UK contracts] if the 
date is missed. But we are asking sellers to agree a significant extension to target dates," he says.
Fearing a collapse in the value of property, some sellers are agreeing to this (rather than pocket a forfeited deposit) 
because they prefer to keep the contract at the current sale price, he says.
For buyers in Italy such as the O'Haras, what chance of getting their deposit back? For purchasers who have paid 
their deposit (up to 20 per cent), there is a good case for it to be returned under force majeure (unforeseeable 
circumstances) if you signed before the national state of emergency was declared, says Gemma Bruce of agent 
Casa &Country.
A Florence-based notary - who does not wish to be named - says that if buyers want to proceed but need the 
completion date to be extended, then a simple exchange of emails agreeing between buyers, sellers and notary will 
suffice. "If you decide not to proceed after having signed the preliminary contract, or wish to renegotiate the price, 
you would need to explain the reasons relating to force majeure," he advises.
"Most lawyers believe that force majeure will stand up as a reason to walk away and have a deposit refunded." 
However, it will be required to explain how Covid-19 has directly affected the property and sale.
Could corona stop your deal?; International property | In the midst of buying overseas? Don't despair - much 
can be done digitally during the pandemic crisis. B....
For example, if your bank has withdrawn your mortgage offer, or if you wish to reduce your offer price because 
income prospects have fallen away.
We are due to complete - but will conveyancing be possible? How binding a completion date may be varies 
according to country. For many buyers of holiday properties or second homes, purchases are just postponed, says 
Edward de Mallet Morgan of Knight Frank. "While many viewings in Europe and the US are being put off due to 
travel bans, there is a little else that cannot be done electronically," he says. His wealthy customers often give their 
family offices power of attorney (POA), so that a lawyer can sign on behalf of the buyer, and the buyer is rarely 
physically present.
"In some locations, such as Barbados, where we are currently working on a purchase, contracts can be scanned 
and emailed and digital signatures can be used," he says.
In Spain, it is not quite so simple. Notaries' offices are still open because they are a public service but only for 
urgent matters, says Alex Radford. "All completions are before a notary so we can exchange contracts for clients 
but we cannot complete due to the state of emergency.
"Completions which we had planned for this month are being suspended so long as the force majeure exists, we 
will extend the deadline in a contract, and when the state of emergency ends we can use POA to complete the 
purchase."
In France, despite the shutdown, purchases are still going through, with even new offers this week, says Leggett. 
Many notaries are working from home and for the first time accepting proof of ID that has not been certified by a 
notary in the UK - which is normally required - but by e-sign software.
"However, if the due-diligence checks cannot be carried out, the completion date will automatically be put back, and 
there is a clause in the compromis de vente (contract) that allows this," she says.
In Italy, such e-sign technology cannot be used. For final contract signings to proceed, the hard copy of the POA 
has to be in the Italian notary's hand, so if you are planning on setting up one of these, allow extra time for getting 
your POA authenticated and apostilled by a UK notary, who then has to courier it to Italy, says Caroline Edwards of 
Personal Puglia, the O'Haras' estate agent I'm buying a new home off-plan, what if it is delayed? Some mid-
construction developments will be delayed due to the shutdown of building sites. Purchasers of new ski properties 
typically take possession of their homes at the start of the winter season, but will have to be prepared for delay until 
the spring, says Giles Gale of Alpine Property Finders. "In most developments there will be a force majeure clause 
that allows for a sixmonth delay."
At the Algarve's largest new residential resort, Ombria, development is proceeding despite the state of emergency 
declared last week, with buyers due to sign the deeds over the next few weeks able to do so without face-to-face 
contact.
They are not alone in reporting "record levels of inquiries" this week as many property hunters are cooped up at 
home browsing online - or, like the O'Haras, wondering about the fate of their investment.

because they prefer to keep the contract at the current sale price, he says.
For buyers in Italy such as the O'Haras, what chance of getting their deposit back? For purchasers who have paid 
their deposit (up to 20 per cent), there is a good case for it to be returned under force majeure (unforeseeable 
circumstances) if you signed before the national state of emergency was declared, says Gemma Bruce of agent 
Casa &Country.
A Florence-based notary - who does not wish to be named - says that if buyers want to proceed but need the 
completion date to be extended, then a simple exchange of emails agreeing between buyers, sellers and notary will 
suffice. "If you decide not to proceed after having signed the preliminary contract, or wish to renegotiate the price, 
you would need to explain the reasons relating to force majeure," he advises.
"Most lawyers believe that force majeure will stand up as a reason to walk away and have a deposit refunded." 
However, it will be required to explain how Covid-19 has directly affected the property and sale.

For example, if your bank has withdrawn your mortgage offer, or if you wish to reduce your offer price because 
income prospects have fallen away.
We are due to complete - but will conveyancing be possible? How binding a completion date may be varies 
according to country. For many buyers of holiday properties or second homes, purchases are just postponed, says 
Edward de Mallet Morgan of Knight Frank. "While many viewings in Europe and the US are being put off due to 
travel bans, there is a little else that cannot be done electronically," he says. His wealthy customers often give their 
family offices power of attorney (POA), so that a lawyer can sign on behalf of the buyer, and the buyer is rarely 
physically present.
"In some locations, such as Barbados, where we are currently working on a purchase, contracts can be scanned 
and emailed and digital signatures can be used," he says.
In Spain, it is not quite so simple. Notaries' offices are still open because they are a public service but only for 
urgent matters, says Alex Radford. "All completions are before a notary so we can exchange contracts for clients 
but we cannot complete due to the state of emergency.
"Completions which we had planned for this month are being suspended so long as the force majeure exists, we 
will extend the deadline in a contract, and when the state of emergency ends we can use POA to complete the 
purchase."
In France, despite the shutdown, purchases are still going through, with even new offers this week, says Leggett. 
Many notaries are working from home and for the first time accepting proof of ID that has not been certified by a 
notary in the UK - which is normally required - but by e-sign software.
"However, if the due-diligence checks cannot be carried out, the completion date will automatically be put back, and 
there is a clause in the compromis de vente (contract) that allows this," she says.
In Italy, such e-sign technology cannot be used. For final contract signings to proceed, the hard copy of the POA 
has to be in the Italian notary's hand, so if you are planning on setting up one of these, allow extra time for getting 
your POA authenticated and apostilled by a UK notary, who then has to courier it to Italy, says Caroline Edwards of 
Personal Puglia, the O'Haras' estate agent I'm buying a new home off-plan, what if it is delayed? Some mid-
construction developments will be delayed due to the shutdown of building sites. Purchasers of new ski properties 
typically take possession of their homes at the start of the winter season, but will have to be prepared for delay until 
the spring, says Giles Gale of Alpine Property Finders. "In most developments there will be a force majeure clause 
that allows for a sixmonth delay."
At the Algarve's largest new residential resort, Ombria, development is proceeding despite the state of emergency 
declared last week, with buyers due to sign the deeds over the next few weeks able to do so without face-to-face 
contact.
They are not alone in reporting "record levels of inquiries" this week as many property hunters are cooped up at 
home browsing online - or, like the O'Haras, wondering about the fate of their investment.

Could corona stop your deal?; International property | In the midst of buying

D ubliners Chris and Patricia O'Hara have had plenty of time to contemplate the "mess" of their Italian retirement 
plans since Ireland's general shutdown to halt the spread of coronavirus on March 12.
So far, they have spent (EURO)42,000 on a rundown farmhouse in Puglia, southern Italy, which they hope will 
eventually be a yoga retreat and art school. Their offer of (EURO)190,000 was accepted in November and they 
have paid a 10 per cent deposit to the Milanese property owners.
"We are due to complete on July 1 but now we don't know what will happen," says Chris, an artist.
"We don't want to bother the elderly owners in Lombardy right now, but we are not sure whether we are going to be 
in a position to proceed. We've had to close our businesses in Ireland for now. We are also worried whether 
Ryanair will survive so that we won't even be able to fly there [Brindisi] and whether Italian property prices will 
plummet."
The O'Haras are far from alone in having committed to buying a property abroad and now being uncertain of their 
ability (or desire) to complete as scheduled in their contracts. The situation is changing daily in many areas, but 
agents, lawyers and notaries are finding new ways of working around an unprecedented situation.

can be done digitally during the pandemic crisis. By....
So where do buyers stand? I need to buy a home but can I view properties? In Spain, physical property viewings 
are not permitted until the state of emergency ends. In France, the situation is similar until the 15-day lockdown 
finishes. "However, we are still getting many inquiries so we can do virtual tours or video viewings and talk through 
with clients on the phone," says Joanna Leggett of Leggett Immobilier, an agency in France.
This is happening across markets that are not completely restricted, says Hugo Thistlethwayte, head of Savills. "We 
are still open for business in many areas, if working under strict conditions. Even physical viewings are happening - 
in parts of the Caribbean and Miami - if all parties are willing."
In Florida, none of the current restrictions are affecting a buyer's ability to purchase a home - apart from flying out to 
see properties, of course - says Zoe Attwood of Homes of America Realty Group. Her company is conducting 
viewings with a British couple looking to buy a villa in Orlando, a search made urgent since their flight home to 
Manchester has been cancelled.
Purchases are still proceeding, she says, as the title company (that manages the conveyancing process in the US) 
will work with the buyer and either mail or email the documents that they need to sign to the buyer. British buyers 
can then sign the documents before a UK notary (assuming they can travel to see one).
If you are in the process of agreeing the sale of your home, use a flexible completion date, says Alex Radford, an 
English-born Marbella-based solicitor at My Lawyer in Spain.
"There needs to be a clause inserted that states 'completion will be by 'x' date or earlier by agreement or later if the 
parties or their legal representatives cannot attend completion due to Covid-19 crisis,'" he says. "At the moment we 
are suggesting a future completion date of at least two months."
My sale has been agreed but I am not sure we will be able to proceed Since sterling has plummeted and 
businesses have closed, many British buyers across Europe are re-evaluating purchases.
But what about if deposits have already been paid? Tim Hughes, a solicitor in Lyon, is working with British cash 
buyers who, since committing to buy a home, have lost money on the stock market that had been earmarked for the 
purchase.
They will now need to apply for a bank loan or find other sources of funding to complete, he says. But if they fail to 
do so and have to pull out, they will likely lose their deposit (5 per cent across France, 10 per cent in Paris), 
because they did not have a typical "safety-net" clause that allows buyers to pull out if they cannot secure a 
mortgage.
"Completion dates in France are a target, not a deadline, and there is no sanction [as there is in UK contracts] if the 
date is missed. But we are asking sellers to agree a significant extension to target dates," he says.
Fearing a collapse in the value of property, some sellers are agreeing to this (rather than pocket a forfeited deposit) 
because they prefer to keep the contract at the current sale price, he says.
For buyers in Italy such as the O'Haras, what chance of getting their deposit back? For purchasers who have paid 
their deposit (up to 20 per cent), there is a good case for it to be returned under force majeure (unforeseeable 
circumstances) if you signed before the national state of emergency was declared, says Gemma Bruce of agent

Virgin Atlantic set to appeal for state aid; Airlines. Commercial loans ;

Virgin Atlantic will in the coming days ask for a package of commercial loans and guarantees worth hundreds of 
millions of pounds, as the carrier battles the aviation industry's worst crisis in decades, according to people familiar 
with the matter.
The airline would be among the first in the UK to do so since the government declared this week it would only act as 
a "last resort" for the country's struggling industry.
Other carriers, including easyJet, regional airlines such as Loganair and Eastern Airways, and the troubled airline 
Norwegian Air Shuttle, which has about 350 UK employees, are also considering following Virgin's lead.
Earlier this week Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said the government would not offer an industry-wide bailout to 
airlines and airports plunged into crisis as countries close their borders to international travel. Instead, the 
government expects the industry to explore options to bolster cash before asking for state aid, which would be 
considered on a case-by-case basis.
A government official said there could be political hurdles to helping Virgin and easyJet, but did not rule out state 
aid for these companies.
Virgin Atlantic set to appeal for state aid Airlines. Commercial loans ; Regional carriers could follow lead despite 
Sunak ruling out bailout for stricken indus....
Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of the carrier, has already offered to inject $250m into the Virgin Group - a 
large portion of which will go to the airline.
Virgin Atlantic declined to comment. The Department for Transport also declined to comment.
The UK, with the world's third-largest aviation network, has taken a tougher approach than other countries such as 
France and Germany, whose governments moved quickly to offer national carriers support. The problem for the UK 
government, say analysts, is the varied nature of Britain's aviation sector compared with other countries.
"If you look at UK airlines and airports they're not all UK-controlled," said Andrew Lobbenberg, aviation analyst at 
HSBC. "British Airways is owned by International Airlines Group, which is a Spanish company, and the largest 
single shareholder is Qatar Airways. Virgin is 49 per cent owned by Delta Air Lines of the US." Wizz UK, Norwegian 
UK and Ryanair UK are subsidiaries of parent airlines from Hungary, Norway and Ireland, respectively.
The deployment of taxpayers' money into aviation is complex "when you recognise the non-UK shareholders behind 
the businesses", said Mr Lobbenberg.
All airlines are seeking holidays from aircraft lease payments. These can stretch to $1m a month for bigger aircraft 
such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, or a third of that for the popular single aisles such as the Airbus A320neo. They 
will also try to raise cash by selling and leasing back their aircraft. "Every airline is coming to us," said one leading 
lessor. "We have seen a significant increase in airlines discussing the refinancing of their fleets," said one of 
London's top aviation finance bankers. This will give lessors a say in who survives and who does not, say industry 
executives. Leasing companies will choose to do deals with the strongest.
For example, two-thirds of Ryanair's 455 aircraft are owned outright. Stephen Furlong, aviation analyst with Davy, 
estimates that with net cash of (EURO)4bn at the end of February, the carrier has some 18 months of liquidity.
EasyJet, which owns 70 per cent of its 331 aircraft and had cash and credit facilities of just over £2bn at the end of 
February, could last for 10 months, Mr Furlong estimates. Mortgaging aircraft could extend that timeline 
significantly.
IAG boasts more than £9bn in cash and credit lines. Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways, has said 
publicly that he does not intend to ask the state for aid beyond the measures offered to the wider business sector 
last week, such as wage support.
Virgin, which has reported losses for the past two years, specialises in the long-haul sector that is expected to be 
the hardest hit. Virgin had just £83m in net cash according to its latest available report and accounts, and already 
leases three-quarters of its 46 aircraft. Leeway for refinancing will be limited.
The carrier must show the government that it is doing what is necessary to qualify for state aid, people familiar with 
the matter said. "They have asked people to take unpaid leave for eight weeks, grounded certain routes, and 
slimmed the cost bases," said one.
But if Virgin is given help, industry experts say Mr Walsh may be stung into demanding a share of state largesse for 
British Airways if the crisis continues beyond the summer. EasyJet too will be nervous about the aid being given to 
its European rivals and may ask to level the playing field. "Every airline will try to get support eventually and you 
could argue they have some justification," said John Strickland, aviation consultant.
Under proposals drawn up by the government, taxpayers could end up with equity stakes in the airlines in return for 
their support.
But Mark Manduca, analyst with Citigroup, warned: "Government aid will be mired in punitive covenants ... that 
potentially could last years.
Virgin Atlantic set to appeal for state aid Airlines. Commercial loans ; Regional carriers could follow lead despite 
Sunak ruling out bailout for stricken indus....
"The chains include high interest rate debt, subordinating current senior bondholders, and future restrictions on pay 
for executives and on dividends. That is not really aid at all."

be suspending connections otherwise.
Ryanair CEO, Michael O'Leary commented, "As Europe's borders become congested or closed, it's vital Ryanair 
plays its part to keep vital medicines and food supplies moving."
"At this time, no one knows how long this [COVID-19] shutdown will last. Rest assured that we and the 18,000

Regional airline easyJet has highlighted the importance of access to liquidity as being the determining factor for the 
future of aviation. According to CAPA analysis, Wizz Air and Ryanair are the leading European airlines for liquidity 
balances.
EasyJet commented on the current challenges by stating that "European aviation faces a precarious future and 
there is no guarantee that the European airlines, along with all the benefits it brings for people, the economy and 
business, will survive what could be a long-term travel freeze and the risks of a slow recovery."
Low-cost carriers Wizz Air and Ryanair have liquidity at 48% and 47% of revenue. On 16 March 2020, Ryanair 
stated that it was receiving a negative impact from the UK Government's restrictions which has meant that most of 
its fleet will become grounded over the following days. It expects to decrease its seat capacity by 80% by April and 
reduce its costs to improve cash flow.
Facing the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, many airlines across the continent have suspended operations by 
75% to 90%, but some European governments have indicated that they will support airline companies throughout 
the crisis.
EasyJet has undertaken a mass of cancellations which are to continue and could result in the majority of its fleet 
becoming grounded. Additionally, it is cost cutting to prevent non-critical expenditure and calling on government 
support for liquidity.
The airline's CEO, Johan Lundgren, commented that "co-ordinated government backing will be required to ensure 
that the [aviation] industry survives."

Boards urged to suspend bonuses for duration of outbreak Executive pay
Boards urged to suspend bonuses for duration of outbreak; Executive pay

Businesses have been urged to suspend bonuses for executives in a move aimed at ensuring company bosses 
share the financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak with staff and shareholders.
Pirc, an adviser to shareholders including the UK's local authority pension funds, which oversees £300bn in assets, 
has written to 4,000 listed companies around the world calling on them to take a tough approach to pay, in 
response to the extreme disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
In the letter, which was sent last week, Pirc called on companies to suspend all payments to executives, other than 
basic salary from April 1, until the end of the financial year.
The letter came as companies around the globe have been forced to halt trading and lay off staff in response to 
strict measures from countries grappling to stop the spread of coronavirus.
Alan MacDougall, managing director of Pirc, wrote that the business community must "demonstrate its recognition 
of the challenges many employees face".
He said: "If it is deemed appropriate to cut dividends and reduce the workforce due to these events, which in many 
cases is already happening, then it is difficult to understand how executive bonuses and [long-term incentive plan] 
awards - essentially based on last financial year - can be justified." He added: "Suspending variable pay at board 
level will send a positive signal to your company and your workforce about the need for shared sacrifice in these 
difficult times."
Boards urged to suspend bonuses for duration of outbreak Executive pay
Several bosses are already facing pay cuts in 2020, including Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. He told 
the Financial Times that he and the rest of the airline's staff would take a 50 per cent pay cut.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA's owner IAG, has accepted a 20 per cent pay reduction for the remainder of his 
contract after delaying his retirement.
Board directors at Kier, the construction group, will also see their pay cut by 20 per cent between April and June.
The focus on pay comes as hundreds of companies in the UK are due to put their pay policies for the next three 
years to a binding vote.
In its letter, Pirc said: "Few if any executive pay schemes are likely to be appropriate for a company in current 
market circumstances and the health emergency."
Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at Merian Global Investors, said: "A sensible board would be asking 
management [of companies under pressure] to make some sacrificial gestures in terms of pay. We have seen some 
[examples of this] and expect we will see more."

Rishi Sunak has resisted the urge to extend his hand to airlines. Quite right. These are the same companies that 
squealed when the government toyed with bailing out Flybe in January.
Politicians then made the right choice not to throw a lifeline to a business with too much debt, high costs and which 
was on the edge of collapse.
IAG, easyJet, Ryanair et al are no Flybes. But the International Air Transport Association has declared that without 
state aid, Europe's airlines could be bust by May. Nonetheless, Mr Sunak is right to insist that they first tap 
investors and banks for cash before running to him for help.
Wizz Air and Ryanair don't need emergency funding in any case, according to Mark Manduca at Citi. IAG and 
easyJet are strong enough to hold off for a while, too. Even with a three-month shutdown, net debt to ebitda might 
only rise to 1.2 times at easyJet and 2.6 times at IAG.
Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are in a much worse state. Virgin Atlantic - owned by billionaire island owner 
Richard Branson and Delta Air Lines of the US - is noticeably more nervy. It made a plea for £7.5bn for the industry 
in emergency state support.
But the government - which has already promised £330bn in loan guarantees, VAT deferrals and wage support - 
must not be seen to make a special case for airlines or to chuck money into the pockets of the tycoons, private 
equity consortiums and infrastructure funds that have mopped up British airports and airlines.
Sunak is on the money in refusing airlines carte blanche
EasyJet has just bunged £174m in dividends to its shareholders, including founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou whose 
family still holds a third of the company. If it needs cash, it should ask them first before going cap in hand to the 
taxpayer.
The government may have to step in with sector-specific support if the crisis is prolonged. Raising funds from 
cashstrapped investors and overburdened lenders will be tricky. Even so, the British government - like the banks - 
must discriminate between viable groups caught up in the maelstrom and those for which coronavirus was just the 
final straw.
And a bailout is hardly a panacea - as the banks can attest after their rescue in 2008. Government support is 
usually accompanied by punitive equity dilution, debt subordination, high interest charges, stringent conditions and 
restrictions on executive pay, dividends and spending plans that can last decades.
The next few months will undoubtedly be turbulent. But it is still better to fly solo.

POINTSSunak said airlines should first seek help from their stockholdersSome airlines, like EasyJet, are still paying 
out huge dividends to shareholdersVirgin Atlantic, Ryanair and EasyJet have grounded most of their aircraft. 
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak[1] has told the country's beleaguered airlines the government will 
not immediately bail them out and that they must first seek other avenues of funding.Sunak's comments apparently 
contradicted statements he made last week where he had pledged support for the industry.U.K. airlines have 
suffered massive loss of income, cancelled flights and grounded aircraft since the coronavirus outbreak has brought 
air traffic to a standstill.British Airways' owner International Airlines Group has reduced capacity by 75%, while 
Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair and EasyJet have grounded most of their aircraft.Airline chiefs have been asking for 
government financing to rescue their companies and prevent bankruptcies.Last week, Richard Branson, chairman 
of Virgin Group, asked the government for 7.5 billion ($8.9 billion) of emergency funds for airlines.Sunak urged 
airlines to seek funds from their shareholders, adding that the British government would intervene only as "a last 
resort" after airlines had "exhausted other options.' 'Given the significant importance of the aviation sector[2] to our 
economy and economic recovery, the government is prepared to enter negotiations with individual companies 
seeking bespoke support as a last resort, having exhausted other options,' Sunak wrote in a letter to aviation 
executives on Tuesday. 
'However, further taxpayer support would only be possible if all commercial avenues have been fully explored, 
including raising further capital from existing investors and discussing arrangements with financial 
stakeholders.'Sunak added however that Transport Secretary Grant Shapps might discuss 'industry-wide measures' 
to help airlines cope with the immediate crisis.'Our immediate focus is on liquidity and protecting jobs and we are 
working with the government to make best use of these measures,' said EasyJet, Europe's second-biggest low-cost 
carrier.The International Air Transport Association, or IATA, has warned of an "apocalypse" in the aviation industry 
unless governments provide help."Travel restrictions and evaporating demand mean that, aside from cargo, there is 
almost no passenger business," IATA chief Alexandre de Juniac. "There is a small and shrinking window for 
governments to provide a lifeline of financial support to prevent a liquidity crisis from shuttering the industry."In turn, 
airports of all sizes have laid off hundreds of workers across the U.K. Some airports may have to be shut 
down.Karen Dee, chief executive of Airport Operators Association, said the British aviation industry was "surprised" 
by Sunak's decision and that the sector will now have to "fight on its own to protect its workforce and its 
future.'"While countries across Europe have recognized the vital role airports play and are stepping into the breach, 
the U.K. government's decision to take a case-by-case approach with dozens of U.K. airports is simply not feasible 
British Government Will Only Bail Out Airlines As 'Last Resort'
to provide the support necessary in the coming days," she said. "Not only does the decision today leave airports 
struggling to provide critical services, it will hamper the U.K. recovery."The Financial Times reported that in the 
event the government does offer financial assistance to certain airlines, ministers would likely want an equity stake 
in return - thereby resulting in significant dilution to existing shareholders.'It will be RBS style and not some soft 
loan,' a source told FT, referring to the government's takeover of Royal Bank of Scotland during the 2008 financial 
crisis.Some analysts predict dark days ahead for U.K. airlines in the absence of government aid.'What helps 
[airlines] get the commercial finance is a government backstop that can reassure lenders they are not the final line 
of funding,' said Gerald Khoo, aviation analyst at Liberum. 'Listed companies can't raise equity fast enough in this 
situation, even if capital markets were open.'The government reportedly was angered by the decision of some 
airlines, including EasyJet, to continue paying dividends to shareholders[3], despite its ongoing troubles. EasyJet 
responded that it was legally obligated to pay out 171 million ($201 million) to its stockholders - including 60m 
($70.6 million) to its largest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou.Nils Pratley agreed with Sunak's decision in the 
Guardian[4].'Major U.K. [airline] operators can withstand a fair amount of temporary financial pain,' Pratley wrote. 
'EasyJet and IAG, owner of British Airways, have boasted about the size of their cash balances and the depth of 
their credit facilities. Fine, let them use those resources In the meantime, the simple message is correct: 
shareholders and owners need to look out for their own interests.' [ 1]: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-

UK government pulls U-turn for airline aid relief
UK government pulls U-turn for airline aid relief

THE GOVERNMENT has changed its plans to provide a rescue package for the UK's beleaguered airline industry, 
it was revealed yesterday, instead opting to give aid on a caseby-case basis.
Last week chancellor Rishi Sunak said he would be discussing a potential package for "specifically airlines and 
airports" in light of the devastation the sector has suffered due to coronavirus.
However, in a letter to the industry, seen by City A.M., Sunak yesterday said that state aid will only be available to 
airlines "as a last resort".
Instead, he went on to say, airlines should be "pursuing all possible actions to preserve cash… including engaging 
with shareholders, lenders and the markets", with government support only "if all commercial avenues have been 
fully explored".
Several airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Easyjet, had been vocal in their calls for assistance from the 
government, warning that there would be further failures unless ministers stepped in.
The decision comes as industry body the International Air Transport Association (IATA) more than doubled its 
previous estimate for the financial damage to global airlines.
According to its latest estimates, airlines could lose as much as $252bn (£214bn) from the damage wrought to the 
sector by the virus.
Previous estimates had fixed the damage at $113bn, but the new figure takes into account updates to global travel 
restrictions.

Sector members reacted angrily to the government's decision announcement, with Karen Dee, chief executive of 
the Airport Operators' Association, saying: "After having publicly announced a support package for airports and 
airlines, we're surprised by where we find ourselves today."
It came as Ryanair yesterday confirmed that it "does not expect to operate flights in April and May" due to the 
coronavirus epidemic, a week after warning that it would ground "most, if not all" of its planes. The budget carrier 
has instead offered its aircraft to all EU governments to use for repatriating civilians.

Rishi Sunak has warned the aviation industry it will only receive "bespoke support" from the government after all 
other options have been exhausted, as it reels from the virtual shutdown in global travel because of the coronavirus 
pandemic.
However, a letter from the chancellor sent yesterday held out the possibility of a significant government intervention 
for companies in the cash-strapped industry that can prove they have pursued all other avenues for survival. "Given 
the significant importance of the aviation sector to our economy and economic recovery, the government is 
prepared to enter negotiations with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort, having 
exhausted other options," Mr Sunak wrote.
"However further taxpayer support would only be possible if all commercial avenues have been fully explored, 
including raising further capital from existing investors and discussing arrangements with financial stakeholders."
In those circumstances terms would be "structured to protect taxpayers' interests", Mr Sunak said in the letter, 
which was sent to airlines, airports and other companies in the sector.
Ministers have not ruled out the idea of taking equity stakes in some airlines to prevent the collapse of otherwise 
viable companies.
One industry insider said airlines seeking government support should expect ministers to demand an equity stake at 
commercial rates and that there would be significant dilution of shareholders.
Sunak warns airlines state support is last resort Aviation
"It will be RBS-style and not some soft loan," the airline insider said, referring to the government's takeover of the 
bank during the 2008 financial crisis.
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Group, last week urged the government to provide up to £7.5bn of emergency 
state support to rescue the UK industry.
With flight bans across most of Europe, Ryanair announced yesterday that it did not expect to resume commercial 
flights before June.
In his letter, which has not been released to the public, Mr Sunak pointed out there were already several schemes 
available to help companies.
The demand that airlines explore every option before asking for help was seen by some of the financially more 
robust carriers as a solution to the dilemma of how to extend support without giving benefits to airlines that were not 
financially viable before the crisis.
"As long as everyone has access to the offer of help, that is fine," said the airline insider. "But if it helps inefficient 
polluting airlines and leaves them stronger than they were before that is not OK."

The global airline industry faces losing more than $250bn in revenues, according to the latest forecast from a trade 
body that has been forced to slash its outlook again as coronavirus spreads.
in of in The hit would amount to a more than 40 per cent fall in revenues from 2019, Iata, the industry trade body 
warned yesterday. It is up from a prediction of $113bn made a few days ago and an initial forecast of $30bn at the 
start of the crisis. Brian Pearce, Iata's chief economist, said the sharp increase in the projected blow stemmed from 
the aggressive extension of travel restrictions in recent days. The bans now cover roughly 98 per cent of passenger 
revenues.
a Capacity was expected to be 90 per cent down in Europe, and a number of airlines in the region are vulnerable to 
collapse. The warning comes as Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost airline, grounded its entire fleet and as 
governments consider rescue packages for the aviation industry. The UK is expected to unveil its package soon.
Alexandre de Juniac, Iata's directorgeneral, said speed was imperative if governments hoped to avoid highprofile 
collapses. Roughly half the world's carriers were atrisk of bankruptcy as cash resources were being decimated. "We 
clearly need massive action very quickly. It has to be quick," he said. "As an industry we are a vital part of the global 
economy."
Mr Pearce said the industry also faced a slower recovery than had been experienced in previous pandemics. "We 
have never seen a pandemic coincide with a deep global recession, which is now expected," said Mr Pearce. "It will 
almost certainly ... delay recovery. It will be a much more gradual slope."

Using previous experience of pandemics, recovery might have been expected to emerge by the third quarter. 
However, by the fourth quarter of this year "we still see the industry some 10 per cent below where we would 
previously have expected," Mr Pearce said. Iata said there were signs of a recovery in air travel in China. "The load 
factor for the domestic market is around 60 per cent so things are improving, but slowly," Mr de Juniac said.

Mar 25, 2020( Joanne Jacobs: http://www.joannejacobs.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Can you imagine getting to 
study abroad somewhere as exotic as Morocco, and then getting stuck there[1] due to coronavirus? Danford, an 
American student from the University of Vermont in Burlington, was less than two weeks into what was supposed to 
be over a month of education and cultural immersion in Moroccan life. 
'We went from thinking we might stay there for the whole semester to leaving as soon as possible,' she told ABC 
News Following the announcement on Sunday, March 15, Danford said the next four days were a blur of finding 
any option for her and at least 27 classmates to get home — all of whom were enrolled in a study abroad program 
focused on climate change through the School of International Training[2] Jaime Molyneux, the director of 
international risk management at UPenn, chartered a private plane for eight students — including Chia — from 
Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport to London Luton Airport on March 19. From there, the students took 
ground transportation to London Heathrow Airport and booked commercial flights to their final destinations. 
According to Molyneux, the university was able to cover costs of the private flight with an emergency fund 'What 
ended up getting us out were connections and money and institutions,' she said. 'I really feel like institutions were 
so much more powerful than the U.S. government.' Danford echoed those sentiments, telling ABC News that she 
and 23 of her peers secured seats on a Ryanair flight, which had been chartered for European citizens, also on 
March 19. They found out about the flight through a travel agent that a student's parents knew Putting aside the 
risks associated with the Ryanair flight, Stahelin commended the group for taking initiative. 'I admire how some 
students decided to take matters into their own hands and be very resourceful, self-organize and get themselves 
out,' he said. Before they had a definitive way home, both Danford and Chia contacted their respective senators 
and representatives, asking their family and friends to do the same.What an adventure those students will have to 
tell their children and grandchildren about! [ 1]: https://abcnews.go.com/Health/american-study-abroad-students-

Airlines beg for rescue as coronavirus hit soars to $250bn
Airlines beg for rescue as coronavirus hit soars to $250bn

Global airlines urged governments on Tuesday to speed up bailouts to rescue the air transport industry as they 
doubled their estimate of 2020 revenue losses from the coronavirus crisis to more than $250 billion.
"We clearly need massive action very quickly and urgently," Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the 
International Air Transport Association (IATA), told reporters.
With planes unable to fly because of travel restrictions, compounded by a plunge in demand over fears of 
contagion, airlines worldwide have grounded most of their fleets, and many have said they need government 
support to survive.
The industry is now contemplating months without flying. Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, 
said on Tuesday it did not expect to operate flights in April or May.
Many will not survive such a hammer blow to their finances. IATA said that without government support, up to half 
of airlines face possible bankruptcy in the coming weeks.
"We have a liquidity crisis coming at full speed - no revenues and costs still on our (books), so we desperately need 
some cash," de Juniac said.
Airline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a financial market rout sparked by fears of a global 
recession, but Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said the full extent of coronavirus's impact on the 
aerospace industry could turn out to be even worse than current dire forecasts.
"Hence our recommendation that investors continue to avoid the sector until we see airline stability," he said.
Airlines beg for rescue as coronavirus hit soars to $250bn
IATA chief economist Brian Pearce said European airlines were most at risk, with airline capacity in the European 
region forecast to be down 90% for the second quarter of 2020.
Analysts have said indebted Norwegian Air is one of the most vulnerable, but it was helped by a small government 
cash injection on Tuesday as it began talks with creditors worried about its liquidity.
IATA broadly stuck to a forecast made last week that government bailouts worth about $200 billion were needed, 
even as it more than doubled its estimate for revenue losses in 2020 to $250 billion, compared with the $113 billion 
forecast it made just 2-1/2 weeks ago. That would represent a 44% decline on 2019's income.
De Juniac, a former Air France-KLM boss, brushed aside a growing debate about whether relief for airlines should 
come with strings attached, such as new commitments on climate goals.
But he said the airline industry would continue efforts already under way to curb emissions once the crisis recedes.
"We are in an emergency situation. It's no time for requirements. I'm sorry for that. We need a full speed massive 
rescue package now," de Juniac said.
With airlines at the front of bailout queues, green advocates fear climate action may lose momentum.
In the United States, Republicans have opposed providing bailouts to passenger and cargo carriers, proposing help 
in the form of $58 billion in loans and saying the government could demand stock, options or other equity in return.
IATA, which groups some 280 airlines including most of the world's largest network carriers, said signs of a deep 
recession could delay a recovery in airline travel - in contrast with the fast rebound seen after previous epidemics.
That could mean "more of a U-shaped than V-shaped recovery," Pearce said, referring in the latter instance to the 
shape of the graph of air travel indicators seen after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
IATA says 2.7 million jobs are supported by the airline industry, with tens of thousands already being furloughed.
"There are a very large number of airlines that are more or less breaking even and ... facing losses. Those airlines 
are very fragile," Pearce said. (Reuters)

       Italy reported a fall in the rate of increase in new coronavirus cases and deaths for the second consecutive day.
 The number of deaths from the COVID-19 breakout in the country rose by 601 on Monday, the smallest increase in 
four days, raising the total death toll to 6077. This is 50 cases less than what was reported on Sunday.
 Italian news agency ANSA reported quoting Emergency Commissioner and Civil Protection Chief Angelo Borrelli 
that 3,780 new positive cases were reported on Monday, compared to 3,957 people who tested positive Sunday.
 A total of 63,927 people were infected with COVID-19 in Italy, which has been in national lockdown since early 
March.
 The country's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said it is early to say when this crisis will be over.
 Meanwhile, the World Health Organization warned that the United States could become the next epicenter of 
COVID-19, citing 'very large acceleration' in infections.
 In all, more than 43,000 people were tested positive for coronavirus in the United States, where the death toll 
crossed 100 in a single day for the first time. A total of 582 deaths have been reported in the country.
 However, even as more states were shutting down to prevent the spread of COVID-19, President Donald Trump 
insisted that the country will soon be open for business. 
 "America will again and soon be open for business. A lot sooner than 3 or 4 months that somebody was 
suggesting," he told reporters at a White House coronavirus task force news conference.
 514 more people died in Spain on Monday, the worst day yet.
Fewer Deaths In Italy From Coronavirus
 In Iran, 1,812 people have died from the virus.
 The Netherlands has banned all gatherings of more than two people until June.
 Almost all states are under lockdown in India, where nine people have died of the disease so far.
 The Chinese city of Wuhan - the epicenter of COVID-19 - will partially lift its lockdown in April.
 Famous African saxophonist Manu Dibango died of coronavirus.
 Budget airline Ryanair announced that most of its flights will be grounded Tuesday.
 According to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University, COVID-19 deaths crossed 17000 and infections are 
nearing 400,000.

"The experience in China suggests a 3-month period for the spread of the virus to be contained and reduced. We 
do not expect to operate flights during the months of April and May at this time, but this will clearly depend on

number mostly between Britain and Ireland. (Reuters)

Richard Branson has committed to investing $250m into his Virgin empire to protect jobs as the government draws 
up plans to take equity stakes in airlines, including Virgin Atlantic, to counter the effects of the crisis.
Sir Richard wrote in a blog post yesterday that the chances of securing a widespread economic recovery would 
"depend critically upon governments around the world" implementing support programmes.
It comes as talks between airlines and the UK government have continued this weekend as the latter draws up 
plans for a politically difficult bailout of a sector that has been blighted by a virtual shutdown of international travel.
The Financial Times revealed on Saturday that the government was drafting a scheme that could see it buy equity 
stakes in carriers and other companies hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis, after warnings that the economic 
packages it had announced would not be enough to save them.
Airlines are expecting to hold another meeting with the government today; one official said there would be daily 
talks with the industry this week.
The official confirmed yesterday that talks were going on about "something more bespoke", which could see the 
government end up with large equity stakes in some of the airlines. But the official added that "we are not there yet" 
in terms of the final shape of any rescue package.
Branson pledges $250m to protect Virgin jobs Airlines
If enacted, the plans under discussion would see the UK taxpayer inject billions of pounds into companies in 
exchange for shares that would eventually be sold back to private investors, according to three people briefed on 
the proposals.
One of the people said the likelihood of taking outright equity positions in the airlines was dependent on the length 
of time that the global aviation industry was, in effect, shut down. More conventional rescue measures such as 
loans, guarantees and tax relief would not be sufficient if the shutdown were to drag on for many months, they said.
They added that the government could provide debt to the airlines that would subsequently convert into equity, 
making the taxpayer a substantial shareholder in the airlines.
But this prospect has been made more likely after the outlook for the airline industry dramatically worsened over the 
past week. Dubai-based Emirates yesterday became the latest carrier to warn it will almost entirely ground its 
passenger aircraft from Wednesday. Both easyJet and Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, have announced 
similar moves.
Carriers are now preparing for a lengthy shutdown in air travel across much of the world. Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair's chief executive, on Friday told the FT that the airline expected a bestcase scenario of no air travel of at 
least two to three months.
Two airline executives said they were, for now, focused on using help from the government on payroll support to 
ease short-term cash issues.

with no flights and no revenue.

unfolding at the UK border. As the country braces for a wave of COVID-19 cases, people are scratching their heads 
and wondering why flights from Italy, China, and Iran are still flowing in. Keep in mind, the UK does not have the 
greatest healthcare system - at all.MORE NEWS: CNN Reporter 'This is About as Pissed Off as I've Ever Seen 
McConnell'[1] Thousands of passengers from Italy, China and Iran arrived in Britain this week. 
Reports indicate that flights from Rome, Beijing, and Shanghai have landed in London every single day leading up 
the Coronavirus outbreak.Flights carrying thousands of passengers from the worst-hit coronavirus areas are still 
landing in Britain. Passengers fromItaly,ChinaandIranhave arrived a Gatwick and Heathrow this week, even as the 
UK went in to lockdown, shutting bars, cafes, restaurants and banning mass gatherings. Planes have arrived in 
London from Rome, Beijing and Shanghai every day this week. Direct flights from Rome are also still due to arrive 
next week.The route between London and Rome has remained open despiteBritish Airways, easyJet and Ryanair 
cancelling all flights between Italy and Britain. Iran Air is still operating three flights a week from the capital Tehran 
and in the last seven days three Iranian aircraft landed at Heathrow. Iranhas the third-highest coronavirus death toll 
with more than 1,500 fatalities. On Saturday two Air China flights from Beijing and a China Eastern jet from 
Shanghai landed at Heathrow, while a flight from Shanghai arrived at Gatwick. This afternoon, a flight from Imam 
Khomeini International Airport in Tehran, is due to arrive at Heatrow Airport at around 3pm this afternoon.[Daily 
Mail[2]]Travelers arriving from China, Iran, and Italy with 'symptoms' of COVID-19 are supposed to be stopped from

Airlines AAL[1] have lost 59.2% compared with the industry[2]'s 56% decline in the past month.American Airlines, 
like most other airline stocks, has been hit hard by the sharp drop in air-travel demand due to the coronavirus 
outbreak,which eventually dented its stock's prospects.Coronavirus-Led Woes Stunt American Airlines' GrowthDue 
to the coronavirus-induced steep plunge in demand, American Airlines aims to cut international flights by 75% and 
domestic flights by 30% in April. In response to the extremely low-demand scenario, this Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) Fort 
Worth, TX-based carrier suspended all its long-haul international flightsapart from the ones flyingto London 
Heathrow and Tokyo. The carrier trimmedits April schedule by more than 55,000 flights and decided to park 
approximately 130 widebody and 320 narrowbody planes. 
Further reductions are planned for May.With revenues being hurt due to extremely low passenger traffic, American 
Airlines is looking to cut costs to drive the bottom line. Evidently, the carrier halted its hiring process apart from 
offering pay-freeze options. Moreover, the carrier decided to temporarily discontinue itsnew hire flight attendant 
classes.In view of the massive slump in passenger revenues due to weak demand, it is natural that American 
Airlines' financial position is being stressed. To bolster its liquidity position, the carrier recently secured a $1-billion 
loan. As a result, it currently has $8.4 billion of total available cash in hand.You can see the complete list of today's

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary and the rest of the airline's employees are to take a 50 per cent pay cut, as 
Europe's largest low-cost carrier prepares for a lengthy shutdown in the region's air travel.
The outspoken executive said Ryanair was working on a best-case scenario of two to three months in which flights 
would be grounded and revenues would vanish as the coronavirus outbreak wreaks havoc on the industry.
However, in an interview with the Financial Times, he admitted that "honestly none of us have any idea". "All that 
you can draw on is what appears to be the Chinese experience. Both for hope and optimism. They seem to have no 
new cases now in the last two days, that's three months later but after very draconian lockdown measures," he said.
"If we follow the same pattern as the Chinese, then I think certainly from our perspective ... we're talking about a 
closedown that will last for at least three months."
Ryanair's move comes as rival easyJet became the latest airline to warn that it will ground the majority of its aircraft 
from Tuesday following similar action by airlines.
EasyJet said it would continue to operate rescue flights to repatriate customers and expects most of these to be 
completed by Monday. After that it will operate a minimal schedule of essential services, mainly on UK domestic 
routes.
Ryanair chief O'Leary and staff to take 50% pay cut ? Prolonged shutdown expected ? EasyJet grounds planes 
? Sector jobs at risk
The airline industry has been at the sharp end of the economic disruption unleashed by the virus, with many major 
carriers lobbying their governments for financial support and a series of top executives taking pay cuts alongside 
their staff.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA owner IAG, this week took a 20 per cent pay reduction for the remainder of his 
contract after delaying his retirement.
Mr O'Leary said he was waiting for details from the UK and Irish governments on programmes to help pay workers 
as Downing Street last night pledged to meet 80 per cent of employee wages up to £2,500 a month. Ryanair is 
already accessing similar schemes that have been put in place across many continental European countries.
"We are facing a situation whereby ... airlines and airports are going to have no customers and no revenues for the 
next two or three months," said Mr O'Leary.
"What we're clearly trying to avoid - if at all possible because we have to preserve cash - we want to avoid mass 
layoffs but the only way we can avoid mass lay-offs in our industry ... is going to be payroll support for the next two 
to four months."
The pay cut would be for April and May. Mr O'Leary said at the end of May the group would have to reassess the 
situation. He added that he could not rule out job cuts further down the line.
Ryanair had cash and cash equivalents of more than (EURO)4bn as of March 12. In addition, the group had 
undrawn credit lines and nearly 300 aircraft that it owned with a current value of about $8bn-$10bn, Mr O'Leary 
said. He did not expect the airline to have to draw on the credit lines for the moment.
Earlier this week, the global airline industry said it would need up to $200bn in emergency support as the travel 
industry continued to bleed cash. The International Air Transport Association, the airlines' main trade body, said the 
majority of carriers faced running out of money within two months.
But Mr O'Leary warned the EU had to be careful over how it offers state aid, saying that governments had to be 
careful not to create "massive distortion" with bailouts that would leave "well-run airlines at the mercy of 
nationalised airlines at the end of this process".

closedown that will last for at least three months."
Ryanair's move comes as rival easyJet became the latest airline to warn that it will ground the majority of its aircraft 
from Tuesday following similar action by airlines.
EasyJet said it would continue to operate rescue flights to repatriate customers and expects most of these to be 
completed by Monday. After that it will operate a minimal schedule of essential services, mainly on UK domestic 
routes.
Ryanair chief O'Leary and staff to take 50% pay cut; ? Prolonged shutdown expected ? EasyJet grounds 
planes ? Sector jobs at risk
The airline industry has been at the sharp end of the economic disruption unleashed by the virus, with many major 
carriers lobbying their governments for financial support and a series of top executives taking pay cuts alongside 
their staff.
Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA owner IAG, this week took a 20 per cent pay reduction for the remainder of his 
contract after delaying his retirement.
Mr O'Leary said he was waiting for details from the UK and Irish governments on programmes to help pay workers 
as Downing Street last night pledged to meet 80 per cent of employee wages up to £2,500 a month. Ryanair is 
already accessing similar schemes that have been put in place across many continental European countries.
"We are facing a situation whereby ... airlines and airports are going to have no customers and no revenues for the 
next two or three months," said Mr O'Leary.
"What we're clearly trying to avoid - if at all possible because we have to preserve cash - we want to avoid mass 
layoffs but the only way we can avoid mass lay-offs in our industry ... is going to be payroll support for the next two 
to four months."
The pay cut would be for April and May. Mr O'Leary said at the end of May the group would have to reassess the 
situation. He added that he could not rule out job cuts further down the line.
Ryanair had cash and cash equivalents of more than (EURO)4bn as of March 12. In addition, the group had 
undrawn credit lines and nearly 300 aircraft that it owned with a current value of about $8bn-$10bn, Mr O'Leary 
said. He did not expect the airline to have to draw on the credit lines for the moment.
Earlier this week, the global airline industry said it would need up to $200bn in emergency support as the travel 
industry continued to bleed cash. The International Air Transport Association, the airlines' main trade body, said the 
majority of carriers faced running out of money within two months.
But Mr O'Leary warned the EU had to be careful over how it offers state aid, saying that governments had to be 
careful not to create "massive distortion" with bailouts that would leave "well-run airlines at the mercy of 
nationalised airlines at the end of this process".

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary and the rest of the airline's employees are to take a 50 per cent pay cut, as 
Europe's largest low-cost carrier prepares for a lengthy shutdown in the region's air travel.
The outspoken executive said Ryanair was working on a best-case scenario of two to three months in which flights 
would be grounded and revenues would vanish as the coronavirus outbreak wreaks havoc on the industry.
However, in an interview with the Financial Times, he admitted that "honestly none of us have any idea". "All that 
you can draw on is what appears to be the Chinese experience. Both for hope and optimism. They seem to have no 
new cases now in the last two days, that's three months later but after very draconian lockdown measures," he said.
"If we follow the same pattern as the Chinese, then I think certainly from our perspective ... we're talking about a

Ryanair has the cash to survive for "maybe even 12 months" with no flights or revenue as the coronavirus shuts the 
air travel industry down, CEO Michael O'Leary said in an interview with the Financial Times on Friday.
O'Leary said that he and the rest of the airline’s employees will take a 50% pay cut for the months of April and May, 
the newspaper reported.
He said he was working on a best-case scenario of two-three months in which flights would be grounded and 
revenues would vanish, but said "honestly none of us have any idea."
"The priority here for us as a company is how do we preserve as much cash so that if we have to operate for three, 
six, nine, maybe even 12 months, with no flights and no revenues how do we survive that, do we have the cash to 
survive that and we believe we do," O'Leary was quoted as saying.
Ryanair had cash and cash equivalents of over 4 billion euros as of March 12, the newspaper quoted O'Leary as 
saying.
In addition, the group has undrawn credit lines and nearly 300 aircraft that it owns with a current value of about $8-
$10 billion, Mr O’Leary was quoted as saying, adding that he did not expect the airline to have to draw on the credit 
lines for the moment. (Reuters)

Airlines want to defer payments to Europe's air traffic controllers, worth about (EURO)500m a month, as they battle 
a deepening cash crisis from a virtual shutdown of international travel amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Carriers are collectively pushing back on paying February's charges that are due next month to Eurocontrol, 
according to people familiar with the situation. Eurocontrol co-ordinates national air traffic management agencies 
and is responsible for collecting route charges from carriers to fund air navigation facilities and services in the EU.
It comes as the global airline industry faces a cash crunch. The International Air Transport Association on Tuesday 
said the sector will need up to $200bn in emergency support as the travel industry bleeds cash in the face of a 
global lockdown.
The airlines' main trade body has warned that the majority of carriers face running out of money within two months 
because of the sudden halt in international flights by governments attempting to contain the outbreak.
A4E, the European airline trade body, said it was asking governments in the region to defer the payment of air 
traffic control charges due as well as waiving aviation taxes at EU or national level to help the sector's future 
recovery.
"At this point, many of Europe's airlines have made the difficult decision to ground all or a substantial part of their 
fleet for the coming weeks. Many carriers have also been forced to proceed with temporary staff cuts ... Any fiscal 
burdens should be put aside until the industry is back on a sound operational and financial footing."
Carriers seek delay to Europe air traffic control payments Airlines
The payment for February is due on April 13, according to Eurocontrol's website. Eurocontrol works by collecting 
money from airlines that fly over European airspace and pays a proportion of that to national governments. In 2018, 
it collected over (EURO)9bn.
Based on figures for January, Ryanair would have paid the most in air traffic charges to Eurocontrol at about 
(EURO)48m.
Eurocontrol declined to comment on the request to defer payments.
Andrew Charlton, a Swiss-based aviation consultant, said that if air traffic controllers - who are in charge of keeping 
the skies safe on a daily basis - are not paid by airlines, then the whole air travel system goes into even more of a 
"meltdown".
He noted that most air traffic control groups typically only have about two or three months' worth of cash, of which a 
large proportion goes on salaries.
On Tuesday, Canso, which represents global air traffic managers, warned that the coronavirus crisis was having a 
big impact on the sector, which is a critical part of national infrastructure.
It noted that air traffic controllers' revenues are directly related to the volume of air traffic they control and so are 
"extremely vulnerable to the decreasing traffic".

BRITS are stocking up on essentials and holding off on booking holidays as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the 
country, but they aren't yet splashing the cash on takeaways, according to data from Starling Bank.
The digital bank said customer spending at supermarkets was soaring to levels typically seen at Christmas, with 
warehouse outlet Costco entering its list of most popular merchants for the first time.
The data, which covers the week to Monday, shows a spike in customer spending last Saturday as customers 
rushed to stock up on groceries.
Unsurprisingly, the bank reported a 13 per cent decline in customer spending on holidays.
The slump in spending was particularly acute at the most popular merchants for holidays, which experienced an 18 
per cent fall in transaction value. Starling said that Airbnb, British Airways, www.Booking.com, Easyjet and Ryanair 
had been particularly hard hit.

Mar 20, 2020( Medical Xpress: http://medicalxpress.com Delivered by Newstex)  Belgium's Charleroi airport 
announced Friday that it will close to commercial flights for at least two weeks because of travel restrictions 
imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus.  The airport, the country's second busiest and the main continental 
European hub for budget airline Ryanair, said it would halt operations on Tuesday night until April 5 at the earliest. 
"Since the end of February the number of 'no shows'—passengers not turning up for flights—has not stopped 
growing," the airport said in a statement in French. "From an initial average of 20 percent, the proportion of 
absences has grown to nearly 90 percent today." Brussels South Charleroi airport, as it is officially known—despite 
lying some 40 km (25 miles) south of the Belgian capital—serves 8.2 million passengers a year. Travel restrictions 
imposed by governments to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic have seen airlines slash services as 
passenger[1] numbers plummet. Ryanair has said it will cancel "most if not all" of its flights from Tuesday. Explore

Mar 20, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Delta Air 
Lines DAL[1] have lost 63.2% compared with the industry[2]'s 59.8% decline in the past month. Delta, like most 
other airline stocks, has been hit hard by the sharp drop in air-travel demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, 
resulting in the stock's depreciation.Coronavirus-Led Woes Dampen Delta's ProspectsDue to the coronavirus-
induced sharp plunge in demand, Delta expects revenues for March to be almost $2 billion less on a year-over-year 
basis. The carrier's projection for April is worse. 
In a bid to match the extremely low-demand scenario, this Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) Atlanta-GA based carrier decided 
to cut systemwide capacity to the tune of 70% until there is a recovery in air-travel demand. Notably, over the next 
two to three months, Delta's international flights will be reduced to more than 80%.You cansee the complete list of 
today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[3]With revenues being dented due to extremely low passenger 
traffic, Delta is looking to cut costs to drive the bottom line. Evidently, the carrier deferred all plans pertaining to 
capital spending. Moreover, the carrier put a pause on hiring and is offering voluntary leave options to employees. 
Apart from accelerating retirement plans of the older planes in its fleet, Delta aims to downsize its active fleet by 
parking at least 50% of the fleetDue to the above-mentioned downsides following the coronavirus outbreak, Fitch 
Ratings lowered its outlook for Delta to negative.Delta apart, carriers like American Airlines AAL[4], JetBlue Airways 
JBLU[5] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[6] cut capacity in the face of dwindling demand due to this health 
hazard.Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating

Ryanair on course to ground entire fleet Airlines

Ryanair has warned that it will ground almost its entire fleet from next Tuesday as travel bans bring passenger air 
transport to a virtual halt.
Europe's biggest low-cost carrier said it expected "most, if not all" flights to be grounded, apart from a small number 
to maintain connections between the UK and Ireland. It will be the largest carrier to date to ground almost its entire 
fleet.
Austrian Airlines, part of Lufthansa, on Monday announced plans to suspend all flights. A large number of other 
airlines have announced measures to slash costs, with some cutting flights by as much as 90 per cent.
In a memo to staff yesterday, Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said bookings over the past two weeks 
had fallen by up to 90 per cent, and warned that if the crisis continued, the company could not rule out job losses.
"The bad news is that this Covid-19 crisis is getting worse. We expect customer numbers and revenues to decline 
sharply in the coming weeks," he wrote.
He expected a number of airline failures and bailouts for others.
"In Ryanair, we have to demonstrate self-help first before we can look to government for support," he said.
Daniel Roeska, aviation analyst at Bernstein, said: "In all likelihood, air travel within Europe will grind to a halt for 
several weeks, a situation hardly anybody running an airline ever considered possible." Mr Roeska said US

groundings after 9/11 lasted three days, while the Icelandic ash cloud in 2010 prompted the cancellation of about 50 
per cent of flights over eight days.
It comes a day after the industry said it would need up to $200bn in emergency support.
Yesterday, Ryanair said it would cut its schedule by 80 per cent from midnight last night until midnight next 
Tuesday. After that it said it expected most of its flights to be grounded.
US carrier JetBlue said it would cut capacity by at least 40 per cent in coming months and had secured a $1bn 
credit line. Chief executive Robin Hayes and chief operating officer Joanna Geraghty will take a 50 per cent pay cut.

Mar 18, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Hertz Global Holdings, Inc. HTZ[1]. Factors like high-debt levels, weakness in the International 
Rental Car segment and coronavirus-related woes hurt the company's financials. However, efficient fleet 
management and improved services are positives.Hertz Global is benefiting from strong performance in the U.S. 
Rental Car segment. Revenues in the segment increased 7.1% in 2019. Efficient fleet management and improved 
services are driving growth in this key unit.The company's cost-control initiatives are also impressing. With slower 
rise in operating, selling, and administrative expenses, the company has been able to keep costs in check.Hertz 
Global Holdings, Inc Price            https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/HTZ/price?icid=chart-HTZ-fundamental/price 
Hertz Global Holdings, Inc price[2] | Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Quote[3]However, the company's International 
Rental Car segment delivered below-par performance in 2019. The unit generated revenues of $2,169 million in the 
period, down 4.7% year over year. 
Sluggishness in the European market is affecting the unit's performance and is expected to impact the overall 
performance going forward. Moreover, coronavirus-induced low demand for car rentals may hurt the company 
going forward.Moreover, Hertz Global's debt to capitalization ratio, a measure of financial leverage, stood at 90.9 
compared with the industry [4]'s average of 49.4. A high debt-to-equity ratio implies that the company is funding 
most of its ventures with borrowings. Also, the company's negative adjusted free cash flow ($202 million) in 2019 
raises concerns.Zacks Rank & Stocks to considerHertz Global carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Few better-ranked 
stocks to consider in the Zacks Transportation [5]sector are GATX Corporation GATX[6], Ryanair Holdings plc 
RYAAY[7] and Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE[8]. GATX sports a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy), whereas Ryanair and 
Spirit Airlines carry a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks

Airlines Co. LUV[1] have lost 24.6% compared with the industry's 44.2% decline in a years' time. The disappointing 
performance was primarily caused by the coronavirus-induced low air traffic demand apart from the prolonged 
grounding of the 34 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet.Let's take a detailed look into the factors hurting the 
stock.Southwest Airlines witnessed a sharp fall in passenger bookings due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
The carrier recently issued a bearish view on revenue per available seat miles (RASM: a key measure of unit 
revenues) for first-quarter 2020. The company now anticipates first-quarter TRASM to either dip 2% or inch up to 
1% from the year-ago quarter's figure.Moreover, drop in traffic demand is expected to persist for the rest of March, 
given the rapid spread of COVID-19. Consequently, first-quarter operating revenues are expected to decline $200-
$300 million. To tackle the low-demand scenario, the carrier aims to reduce capacity by a minimum 20% in the Apr 
14-Jun 5 period. Since the carrier has 34 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet, prolonged grounding since March 2019 is 
significantly hurting the company. Apart from incurring high non-fuel unit costs, the carrier's operating income was 
hurt to the tune of $828 million in 2019. Also, Southwest Airlines expects the jets to remain grounded through early 
August 2020.Zacks Rank & Stocks to considerSouthwest Airlines carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Few better-
ranked stocks in the Zacks Transportation [2]sector are GATX Corporation GATX[3], Ryanair Holdings plc

cutting costs... companies are trying to adapt as the coronavirus hits demand and the draconian measures taken to 
contain the spread of the illness undercut both production and demand.With the economic impact of the coronavirus 
threatening the survival of many firms, governments have pledged tens of billions to help them limp along, or failing 
that, to bankroll outright rescues or nationalisation if necessary.Here are some measures companies have 
implemented.Several industrial giants, in particular in the automobile industry, have moved to reduce or even 
suspend their production.French automobile manufacturer Peugeot-Citroen is shutting down all of its production 
sites in Europe, and Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler with which it is in the process of merging, intends to close 
most of its facilities in Europe. Germany's VW said Tuesday it would shutter most of its European plants for two to 
three weeks.France's Renault is halting production at plants in France, Spain and Slovenia. The Vauxhall factory,

week.Airbus said it was suspending work at its French and Spanish plants for four days to take measures to 
improve workplace safety in light of the coronavirus.Even the luxury industry is taking steps.Gucci, part of the 
Kering group, is closing all of its sites until March 20. Meanwhile Hermes is shutting its manufacturing sites until the 
end of the month.In Germany, long-distance bus companies Flixbus and Blablabus said they were halting services 
to and from Germany as new travel restrictions take effect.Italian shipyard Fincantieri, which has also halted output,

extra time off to use it.Air France says it will look at reducing working hours, a measure that several countries have 
facilitated with easier access to state benefits for workers now forced into part-time work.Low-cost airline Ryanair, 
which has forecast an 80 percent drop in flights for April and May, said it is looking at that option along with 
voluntary departures and temporarily suspending work contracts.Forcing workers into unemployment temporarily is 
also an option that several countries have made easier, with Volkswagen Spanish subsidiary Seat taking that 
course when it began having trouble receiving parts.UK mobile phone retailer Dixons Carphone meanwhile said it 
was axing 2,900 jobs as it faces "turbulent times".Firms have also moved swiftly to cut costs.Air France-KLM, which 
is being forced to cut as many as 90 percent of flights, has said it will reduce its planned investments for 2020 by

350 million euros and make 200 million euros in savings elsewhere as it seeks to ensure it has enough cash on 
hand.Firms are not sparing shareholders from the pain either. Lufthansa, which is chopping as much of 90 percent 
of flights, said it would not distribute a dividend from 2019 earnings as it seeks to keep hold of cash.Companies are 
not hesitating to take up offers of state support.German tourism giant TUI, which employs 70,000 people worldwide 
and has suspended the "majority" of its operations over the coronavirus, has made a request for state 
aid.Germany's government has promised "unlimited" loans to stricken firms via the state bank KfW.US airlines have 
asked for a $50-billion bailout.The Italian government said it intends to re-nationalise the bankrupt former national 
carrier Alitalia under an emergency economic rescue plan for the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, France stands 
ready to nationalise large companies "if necessary", Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday.In the UK 
however, long-struggling clothing and household goods retailer Laura Ashley Holdings collapsed into near 
bankruptcy as refinancing talks failed.

US carriers demand $50bn rescue as world air travel industry grinds to halt
US carriers demand $50bn rescue as world air travel industry grinds to halt

The US airline industry is calling for $50bn in emergency support as governments around the world step in to help 
domestic airlines survive an unprecedented shutdown of international travel amid the widening coronavirus crisis.
Airlines for America, the trade body that represents the biggest US passenger airlines, including United, Delta and 
American, said it wanted the government to provide $25bn of loans and $25bn of grants to help the industry survive 
the coronavirus outbreak. The organisation warned that all seven of its members that carry passengers would run 
out of money before the end of the year if the crisis continued.
US officials yesterday confirmed that the government was considering shortterm liquidity support for its airlines, 
which before the crisis was one of the most financially robust aviation sectors in the world. "We don't see the 
airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch we're going to try to help them," said Larry Kudlow, director of the 
United States National Economic Council.
The US follows France, Italy, Norway, Russia and others, which have indicated they would provide support 
measures - ranging from low-cost loans to tax breaks - for their struggling airlines.
The European Commission, which has proposed closing the EU to inbound travel for 30 days, has also said it 
would develop a framework to allow member countries to offer state aid "at unprecedented levels" in an attempt to 
bolster liquidity during the crisis.
US carriers demand $50bn rescue as world air travel industry grinds to halt
French finance ministry officials said they expected a package to be ready in "the coming days". There was no 
immediate plan to increase the French state's 14 per cent stake in Air France-KLM, but state-backed loans were on 
the table, officials told the Financial Times.
Italy and France are also expected to revive measures used during the financial crisis to support the wages of those 
temporarily laid off, according to one airline in talks with those governments.
The moves come as air travel grinds to a virtual halt across the globe - and in Europe in particular - forcing airlines 
to ground most of their fleets and lay off thousands to preserve cash. More than 14 airlines yesterday announced 
measures to slash costs, with some reducing flights by as much as 90 per cent.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, said a total grounding of the entire 
fleet could not be ruled out.

THE UK's largest airlines yesterday took drastic steps to ensure they could survive the coronavirus outbreak, 
grounding the vast majority of their fleets in response to widespread travel bans and flight cancellations.
Aviation stocks were again among the biggest fallers on the FTSE, with British Airways owner IAG losing 27 per 
cent and Easyjet down 19 per cent.
IAG said that it would cut 75 per cent of its capacity in April and May, with chief Willie Walsh announcing that he 
would stay in his position due to the crisis. Shares plummeted 27 per cent to 255.7p yesterday.
Virgin Atlantic said it would ground 85 per cent of its fleet during April, and has also asked staff to take unpaid leave 
of up to eight weeks over the next three months. Ryanair also said it would ground the majority of its fleet in the 
next week, reducing its seat capacity by 80 per cent in April and May.
Yesterday it was revealed that the airline's bosses would write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson seeking £7.5bn in 
state aid for UK aviation. Easyjet also joined calls for government support for the industry.
Both IAG and Easyjet stressed the strength of their respective balance sheets, with IAG reporting a total liquidity of 
(EURO)9.3bn (£8.5bn). Other airlines are in a more precarious state, with Norwegian especially exposed.
The carrier said it would cut capacity by 85 per cent and temporarily lay off 7,300 staff.
Separately yesterday senior executives at Heathrow airport, including boss John Holland-Kaye, said they will take 
pay cuts over the next few months as the UK's busiest airport tries to limit the damage done by the coronavirus 
outbreak.

Could Major Airlines Go Bankrupt? Analyst Warns Urgent Action Is Needed As Bookings Drop Due To

Could Major Airlines Go Bankrupt? Analyst Warns Urgent Action Is Needed 
As Bookings Drop Due To Coronavirus

Mar 17, 2020( International Business Times Australia: http://www.ibtimes.com.au/ Delivered by Newstex)  Most 
major global airlines could go bankrupt in the coming months as bookings drop due to coronavirus concerns, an 
Australia-based consultancy warned Monday. "Coordinated government and industry action is needed — now — if 
catastrophe is to be avoided," the CAPA Centre for Aviation said. 
"Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded, and what flights there are operate much less than 
half full." Major airlines have had to cut flights and employees, as the coronavirus takes its toll on the industry. Low-
cost carrier Ryanair announced Monday that it would ground most of its fleet over the next seven to 10 days. United 
Airlines also announced[1] that it is cutting 50% of its flying capacity in April and May. In addition, American Airlines 
willsuspend 75% of its international long-haul flights. On Friday, Delta Air Lines announceda capacity reduction of 
40%[2]within the next few months. The company will also be cutting all flights to Europe for the next 30 days. U.S.-
based airlines are seeking more than $50 billion[3] in assistance from Washington amid the crisis. The Trump 
administration is mulling a financial package that would help airlines, cruise lines and other parts of the private 
sector. Treasury Steven Mnuchin has claimed that this is not a 'bailout' for the travel industry. "I want to be clear, 
this is not bailouts, we are not looking for bailouts,' Mnuchin told lawmakers[4] Wednesday. 'There may be specific 
industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending.' 'I would assume the airlines would be on 
the top of the list," he continued. U.S.-based airlines employ roughly750,000 people. There are currently over 3,800 
cases of coronavirus in the U.S., with the death toll topping 70. More than 6,500 people worldwide have been killed 
by the virus. [ 1]: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-airlines-coronavirus-flights-half-april-may/ [ 2]:

Alt Text Virgin Airline  Move comes amid warnings that global pandemic could bankrupt aviation industry One-
Minute Read[1] The Week Staff[2] Tuesday, March 17, 2020 - 6:06am Virgin Atlantic staff are to be asked to take 
eight weeks of unpaid leave over the next three months, to help the airline cope during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The airline is planning to cut 80% of flights and ground 75% of planes in response to the global outbreak, which 
threatens to take a wrecking ball to the aviation industry. See related Airlines in crisis: coronavirus bites hard[3] 
Why global markets are in 'free fall'[4] The carrier is also planning decreases to staff salaries and a reduction in sick 
pay to 12 weeks full pay.It will also offer voluntary redundancies, alongside sabbaticals of between six to 12 
months. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said that the move was a response to 'unprecedented pressure' on the 
industry, echoing calls for the government to give 'clear, decisive and unwavering support'. They added that airlines 
will only 'weather this storm and emerge in a position to assist the nation's economic recovery' if the government 
provides financial aid.

#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;- According to The Daily Telegraph[7], the appeal for government aid 
comes to the backdrop of a growingdisagreement betweenVirgin Atlantic and British Airways over calls for a 7.5bn 
state bailout. The paper reports thatVirgin Atlantic, which is backed by billionaire businessman Sir Richard Branson 
and US airline Delta, has asked for emergency government loans. However, the owner of rival BA has insisted no 
further aid is needed. Elsewhere, Ryanair says it is expecting to ground the majority of its fleet across Europe[8] 
over the next seven to 10 days due to the travel restrictions put in place across Europe this week. The budget 
carrier said it could also reduce seat capacity by 80% and ground itsentire fleet in April and May. Other airlines to 
announce drastic route cuts and plane groundings yesterday include American Airlines, United Airlines, SAS, Air 
France-KLM and Air New Zealand. One aviation consultancy told Sky News[9]that coronavirus could leave the 
entire industry just months away from collapse. 'By the end of May 2020, most airlines in the world will be bankrupt,' 
the Centre for Aviation said. 'Coordinated government and industry action is needed - now - if catastrophe is to be

avoided. 'As the impact of the coronavirus and multiple government travel reactions sweep through our world, many 
airlines have probably already been driven into technical bankruptcy, or are at least substantially in breach of debt 
covenants,' it added. The Guardian[10] reports that share prices in virtually all airlines have collapsed by more than 
50% since the coronavirus crisis struck Europe. 'This crisis is going to be grim,' said Jon Horne, president of the 
European Cockpit Association, last week.'It is neither a Gulf war nor Sars, nor 9/11, or the 2008 financial crisis, but 
all of them together.'  UK News[11] World News[12] Europe[13] US[14] Transport[15] Business[16] Companies[17]

Mar 17, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Layoffs and cutting costs... 
companies are trying to adapt as the coronavirus hits demand and the draconian measures taken to contain the 
spread of the illness undercut both production and demand.With the economic impact of the coronavirus 
threatening the survival of many firms, governments have pledged tens of billions to help them limp along, or failing 
that, to bankroll outright rescues or nationalisation if necessary.Here are some measures companies have 
implemented.- Suspending production -Several industrial giants, in particular in the automobile industry, have 
moved to reduce or even suspend their production.French automobile manufacturer Peugeot-Citroen is shutting 
down all of its production sites in Europe, and Italian-US carmaker Fiat Chrysler with which it is in the process of 
merging, intends to close most of its facilities in Europe.Germany's VW said Tuesday it would shutter most of its 
European plants for two to three weeks.France's Renault is halting production at plants in France, Spain and 
Slovenia.Tyre giant Michelin is halting production at its sites in Spain, France and Italy for at least a week.Airbus 
said it was suspending work at its French and Spanish plants for four days to take measures to improve workplace 
safety in light of the coronavirus.Even the luxury industry is taking steps.Gucci, part of the Kering group, is closing 
all of its sites until March 20. Meanwhile Hermes is shutting its manufacturing sites until the end of the month.In 
Germany, long-distance bus companies Flixbus and Blablabus said they were halting services to and from 
Germany as new travel restrictions take effect.- Reduced hours, forced leave, layoffs - Italian shipyard Fincantieri, 
which has also halted output, has asked its workers to use their annual vacation time.Airlines have been been hit by 
a double-whammy: plunging demand and sweeping travel restrictions imposed by governments.They have taken 
different measures to adapt.Russian airline Aeroflot has asked employees who have accumulated extra time off to 
use it.Air France says it will look at reducing working hours, a measure that several countries have facilitated with 
easier access to state benefits for workers now forced into part-time work.Low-cost airline Ryanair, which has 
forecast an 80 percent drop in flights for April and May, said it is looking at that option along with voluntary 
departures and temporarily suspending work contracts.Forcing workers into unemployment temporarily is also an 
option that several countries have made easier, with Volkswagen Spanish subsidiary Seat taking that course when 
it began having trouble receiving parts.UK mobile phone retailer Dixons Carphone meanwhile said it was axing 
2,900 jobs as it faces "turbulent times".- Cost cutting -Firms have also moved swiftly to cut costs.Air France-KLM, 
which is being forced to cut as many as 90 percent of flights, has said it will reduce its planned investments for 2020 
by 350 million euros and make 200 million euros in savings elsewhere as it seeks to ensure it has enough cash on 
hand.Firms are not sparing shareholders from the pain either. 
Companies hit pause button as coronavirus infects economy
Lufthansa, which is chopping as much of 90 percent of flights, said it would not distribute a dividend from 2019 
earnings as it seeks to keep hold of cash.- State support -Companies are not hesitating to take up offers of state 
support.German tourism giant TUI, which employs 70,000 people worldwide and has suspended the "majority" of its 
operations over the coronavirus, has made a request for state aid.Germany's government has promised "unlimited" 
loans to stricken firms via the state bank KfW. US airlines have asked for a $50-billion bailout.The Italian 
government said it intends to re-nationalise the bankrupt former national carrier Alitalia under an emergency 
economic rescue plan for the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, France stands ready to nationalise large 
companies "if necessary", Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said Tuesday.In the UK however, long-struggling 
clothing and household goods retailer Laura Ashley Holdings collapsed into near bankruptcy as refinancing talks 
failed.

German-based firm Avialliance, which runs airports in Greece, Hungary and Puerto Rico, has tabled a proposal to 
acquire a 25 per cent stake in the UK airport, Sky News reported last night.
The offer follows weeks of turmoil for airlines, after Flybe - in which Stobart held a 30 per cent stake - collapsed in 
early March. Easyjet and Ryanair yesterday announced they were grounding most of their fleet, while Virgin Atlantic

Mar 17, 2020( Cantech Letter: http://www.cantechletter.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The calamity faced by airlines 
worldwide after the 9-11 terrorist attacks could be just a blip on the radar compared to today's coronavirus crisis, 
says aviation expert Pilar Wolfsteller of Flightglobal, who says a number of carriers will be facing stiff challenges as 
the pandemic continues across the globe.Major airlines worldwide issued a joint open letter on Monday asking 
governments to support their carriers in their time of need, as nations close borders and restrict both domestic and 
international travel in aid of slowing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. 'The unprecedented circumstances triggered 
by the coronavirus outbreak pose an existential threat not only to the airline industry but more generally to global 
trade and commerce, and social connectivity,' said Jeffrey Goh, chief executive of Star Alliance[1], one of three 
airline groups including SkyTeam and oneworld which published the letter. 'As airlines stretch their limits to manage 
the crisis, it is equally critical for governments and stakeholders to avoid further burdens and step up with 
measures, as some have, that will ensure the future of the travel industry.'The news comes as major carriers have 
announced drastic cuts to service in recent days. 
 American Airlines (American Airlines Stock Quote, Chart, News Nasdaq:AAL[2]) on Saturday said it will be 
shuttering 75 per cent of its international service up until May 6 and grounding most of its widebody fleet, with 
British Airways announcing a similar 75 per cent reduction.  Ryanair, Europe's largest carrier, announced a 
reduction of seat capacity by 80 per cent. 'It's going to be a devastating blow to many of the carriers,' said 
Wolfsteller, speaking to CNBC on Monday. 'We've got a number of the majors in the United States announcing 40 
per cent, 50 per cent, 75 per cent in their international service.' 'Then we also have local carriers such as Spirit and 
Frontier that primarily have regional networks here in the United States that are going to be running into a lot of 
trouble because their cash flow isn't that great,' she said. 'So we have a whole bunch of problems running from the 
regionals all the way up to the international carriers and we're going to be facing a pretty long-term crisis in the 
aviation industry.' Perhaps more dire, the International Air Transport Association, which represents almost 300 
airlines, said that the pandemic could cut revenues by US113 billion in 2020 alone and the Centre for Aviation 
claimed that the coronavirus will bankrupt most of the world's airlines by the end of May unless governments and 
the industry work together to address the crisis.Wolfsteller says not knowing how long the pandemic will go on puts 
the current crisis in a different category compared to the disruption seen in the airlines industry following the 
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. 'It's an open-ended question at the moment,' Wolfsteller 
said. 'After 911, airspace closed for about four or five days before air travel slowly got back to normal, and experts 
Aviation industry set for 'long-term crisis', expert says
and industry analysts are starting to say, 'We don't even know if this is going to be worse than 911.'' 'Just looking at 
the demand drop-off over the last couple of weeks, we really don't know where the bottom is on this,' she said.

ReleaseChicago, IL - March 17, 2020 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every 
day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial 
markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1], Air France KLM AFLYY[2], Delta 
Air Lines DAL[3], American Airlines AAL[4] and Southwest Airlines LUV[5].Here are highlights from Monday's 
Analyst Blog: Airlines Brought to Their Knees by Coronavirus: What's Ahead?The dreaded coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on Mar 11, has been a nightmare 
for stocks, keeping investors on the edge.Due to his health hazard, which has claimed multiple lives apart from 
infecting many more across the globe, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones plunged to their historic lows on 
Mar 12, resulting in the end of the 11-year bull run.Due to coronavirus woes, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow 
Jones have tanked 16.1%, 12.2% and 18.8%, respectively, so far this year, paring last year's impressive 
gains.Jolted Airlines Take Actions to Meet Dwindling DemandEven though coronavirus-related fears have rattled 
most sectors, travel-focused stocks, which include airlines, have borne the brunt of the outbreak. 
Evidently, the ZacksAirline[6]industry has shed 35.9% of its value since the commencement of February compared 
with the S&P 500 index's loss of 15.9% in the same time frame.With international travel demand dwindling due to 
the rapid spread of this highly infectious disease, airline stocks are getting clobbered. With the disease spreading to 
countries like Italy, South Korea, Iran, the United States and Germany, many people are unwilling to fly to stay safe 
and avoid contracting the disease from a fellow passenger.In a bid to fight coronavirus-led low demand for air-
travel, airlines from all corners of the globe are trimming their capacity. With Italy suffering the most due to COVID-
19 in Europe, European carrier Ryanair Holdings, sporting a Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy), lowered its 2020 traffic forecast 
by 3 million to 151 million. Also, Air France KLM suspended all its flights to/from Italy from Mar 14 through Apr 
3.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[7]Airline companies based in 
the United States too have resorted to various measures for tackling the coronavirus-led sharp drop in demand. 
Evidently, Delta Air Lines will slash overall capacity by 40% in the next few months, the highest in its history, 
including 2001, as air travel demand sees a rapid fall and revenues take a hit. Moreover, American Airlines aims to 
cut international flights by 75% to match the extremely-low demand scenario.Also, to combat the drop in demand, 
The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Ryanair , Air France KLM, Delta Air Lines , American Airlines and 
Southwest Airlines
airlines are reducing capital expenses, discretionary operating costs as well as suspending share buybacks.More 
Turbulence Down the Road?Even though the 30-day ban on travel to the United States from 26[8] European 
countries announced last week by President Trump (expanded subsequently to include UK and Ireland) is aimed at 
preventing further spread of the disease, the development implies a further setback to the already beleaguered 
airline stocks. Moreover, a ban on domestic air travel is also being reportedly[9] considered to prevent the 
spread.With demand fast-disappearing and the scenario unlikely to improve at least in the near term, first-quarter 
earnings are likely to be hurt severely by this pandemic. For instance, United Airlines, which has already withdrawn 
its guidance for first-quarter 2020 and the full year as well, expects March revenues to be $1.5 billion lower than 
March 2019. Also, Southwest Airlines recently issued a bearish unit revenue guidance for the March quarter due to 
coronavirus-led low demand. First-quarter operating revenues are expected to decline between $200 and $300 
million.Moreover, the International Air Transport Association currently expects airline passenger revenues for 2020 
to be hurt in the $63-$113 billion band.ConclusionThe above write-up indicates in no uncertain terms that the airline 
industry, which even before the coronavirus outbreak was suffering from issues like prolonged grounding of Boeing 
737 MAX jets, has been dealt a body-blow. What is more alarming is that the situation is likely to get worse at least 
in the near term. With the adversity showing no signs of abating, revenues in the upcoming summer season, usually

Mar 17, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  We recently issued an 
updated report on Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC[1]. Factors like low volumes, high-debt levels and 
coronavirus-related woes have hurt the company's financials. However, its shareholder-friendly approach bodes 
well.Norfolk Southern is constantly undertaking efforts to streamline operations by curbing costs. The company's 
operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of revenues) in 2019 increased to 64.7% from 65.4% a year 
ago. Notably, lower value of the metric bodes well. Further, the company aims to achieve an operating ratio of 60% 
in 2021. Moreover, its new precision scheduled railroading operating plan, TOP21, aims to enhance efficiency and 
customer service.Moreover, the company's efforts to reward its investors through share buybacks and dividend 
payments are commendable. In 2019, the company returned $3,048 million to its shareholders through dividend 
payouts ($949 million) and buybacks ($2,099 million). Notably, Norfolk Southern has hiked its quarterly dividend 
payout 
four 
times 
since 
2018.Norfolk

https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/NSC/price?icid=chart-NSC-fundamental/price Norfolk Southern Corporation 
price[2] | Norfolk Southern Corporation Quote[3]However, automotive volumes declined 2% in 2019 due to 
decelerating vehicle production in the United States. 
Key components in the merchandise segment like forest and consumer (volumes down 7% in 2019) as well as 
metals and construction (volumes down 5% in 2019) performed dismally.Apart from the merchandise segment, key 
units like coal and intermodal put up a poor show due to below-par rail traffic volumes. In 2019, intermodal volumes 
at Norfolk Southern declined 4%, while coal volumes shrank 12%. Due to the sluggish performance of its key 
divisions, overall volumes declined 5% in 2019. Due to the lackluster freight scenario, first-quarter 2020 revenues 
are expected to be similar to what was achieved in fourth-quarter 2019.Moreover, the company's high-debt levels 
are concerns. Also, the coronavirus outbreak is a setback for the company and might delay shipments. The same is 
likely to hurt first-quarter 2020 results.Zacks Rank & Stocks to considerNorfolk Southern carries a Zacks Rank #3 
(Hold).Few better-ranked stocks to consider in the zacks Transportation[4] sector are GATX Corporation GATX[5], 
Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY[6] and Spirit Airlines, Inc. SAVE[7]. GATX sports a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy),

Mar 13, 2020( RT: For Decision Makers in Respiratory Care: http://www.rtmagazine.com Delivered by Newstex)  
Editor's note: Revised Mar 13 2330 UTC to update total COVID-19 cases and cases in neighboring countries. The 
tiny Balkan state of Montenegro is the only country in Europe without a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus that 
has swept across the globe and infected over 125,000 people. Forty-four other European countries have confirmed 
COVID-19 cases, and Europe is home to 6 of the top 10 most infected countries outside China, and 12 of the top 16 
outside China. 
Exactly how Montenegro, which has a population of 628,066, has stayed coronavirus-free is not known. The 
country is bordered by five other Balkan states, all of which have confirmed the virus: Bosnia and Herzegovina (24 
cases), Serbia (48), Croatia (49), Kosovo (2), and Albania (42). What's more, Montenegro is only about 350 miles 
away from Italy, which now has the second most COVID-19 infections in the world (17,660 cases), behind only 
China.  Nations in Europe reporting cases of COVID-19 (as of Mar 13) represented in RED.According to Al 
Jazeera[1], Montenegro has close ties to its neighbor across the Adriatic, as thousands of Balkan people reside in 
Italy and frequently travel to the country.However, when the virus began to spread in China and later in Italy, 
Montenegro took steps to restrict travel. In early February, Montenegro indefinitely 'suspended all tourist 
arrangements with China[2],' according to Al Jazeera. Then in late February, the country banned flights operated by 
Ryanair and WizzAir to and from Northern Italy[3], SimplyFlying.com reported. And while it appears the bans may 
have helped prevent coronavirus spread so far, the risk of coronavirus infections in Montenegro is 'high,' the 
country's government said on Mar 3[4]. 'The widespread local transmission of the virus in Italy, with which 
Montenegro has cultural and transport links, as well as the growing number of affected provinces and areas, [imply] 
a high certainty that further local spread of the infection in Italy will continue ,' said health minister Kenan 
Hrapović[5], who noted the spread of infections originating in Italy. 'Their increase, as well as the number of 
countries outside China reporting cases of infection with the novel coronavirus, represent possible, that is, potential 
sources of infection for the population of Montenegro.'According to a Mar 6 article from Balkan Insight, 34 people in 
Montenegro[6] 
were 
under 
surveillance 
for 
COVID-19, 
but 
no 
infections 
were 
announced.

Airline Stocks Slump on Slashed Capacity, Travel Restrictions due to COVID-19 Pandemic
Airline Stocks Slump on Slashed Capacity, Travel Restrictions due to 
COVID-19 Pandemic

 Airline stocks were sharply lower pre-market Monday after various companies slashed their capacity amid lower 
demand due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and as several countries imposed travel and flight restrictions. 
American Airlines (AAL) said Saturday it will cut its international capacity by 75% until May 6. The carrier also 
expects to reduce its domestic capacity by 20% in April and by 30% in May on a year-over-year basis.
On Sunday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) said it will suspend flights to London from Detroit and flights to Dublin from New 
York.
United Airlines (UAL) said Sunday its March revenue to be $1.5 billion lower year-over-year and consequently plans 
to reduce its capacity by approximately 50% for April and May. In the first two weeks of March, the company said it 
had more than 1 million fewer customers compared with the same period last year, and warned that the situation is 
"getting worse."
A Reuters report said Southwest Airlines (LUV) was "seriously considering" cutting the number of its flights due to 
the coronavirus pandemic.
Ryanair (RYAAY) said on Monday it was taking immediate action to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including 
actions to cut operating expenses and improve cash flows. The company said it will ground surplus aircraft, defer 
capital expenditures and share buybacks, freeze recruitment and discretionary spending, and implement various 
voluntary leave options.
Ryanair also said it will temporarily suspend employment contracts and reduce working hours and payments. The 
company said it expects to reduce its seat capacity by up to 80% for April and May, and that a full grounding of its 
aircraft cannot be ruled out.

Ryanair will ground most of its aircraft over the next seven to 10 days as Europe's biggest low-cost airline braces 
for an up to 80% cut in capacity over the next two months and could even ground its entire fleet due to coronavirus 
travel restrictions.
It said the "extraordinary and unprecedented travel restrictions" being implemented across the continent had 
resulted in a substantial decline in bookings over the last 2 weeks, which it expected it to continue for the 
foreseeable future.
With seat capacity set to shrink by up to 80% in April and May, Ryanair said a full grounding of the fleet cannot be 
ruled out as "social distancing" restrictions in countries where its fleet is not grounded "may make flying to all intents 
and purposes, impractical, if not, impossible."
It said it would make further cuts to schedules as necessary.
Ryanair shares were down 20% at 8.41 euros by 1035 GMT.
To reduce operating expenses and improve cash flows, the Irish airline said it would ground surplus aircraft 
immediately, defer all capital expenditure and share buybacks, freeze recruitment and discretionary spending.
A series of voluntary leave options will also be introduced, along with temporary suspensions to employment 
contracts, and significant reductions to working hours and payments.
Ryanair is working with unions across the EU on those measures.
Ryanair slashes flights and says could ground entire fleet
Ryanair said it has strong liquidity, with strong cash and cash equivalents of over 4 billion euros as at March 12.

Mar 16, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Major world 
airlines on Monday axed almost all flights on a temporary basis as the worsening coronavirus crisis sparks travel 
bans, ravages demand and sends shares into freefall, triggering pleas to help carriers survive.IAG, owner of British 
Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia, announced it would slash flight capacity by 75 percent during April and May 
owing to the COVID-19 outbreak.The London-based carrier's share price crashed nearly 27 percent in mid-
afternoon deals.Other airlines tumbled, with Germany's Lufthansa erasing almost 11 percent in value and Air 
France wiping out 17 percent on similar announcements.Britain's Virgin Atlantic added that it has decided to park 
75 percent of its total fleet -- and in April this will rise as high as 85 percent. Airlines are axing flights and shares are 
plummeting Photo: AFP / Adrian DENNIS Virgin has reportedly called upon the UK government to inject emergency 
support totalling 7.5 billion pounds ($9.2 billion, 8.3 billion euros) to help keep Britain's aviation industry flying.In 
Germany, Lufthansa has been forced to scrap around two thirds of its flights in coming weeks as several countries 
including the United States ban travellers from Europe. "Last week saw a rapid acceleration of the impact of 
COVID-19 on global aviation and tourism," Virgin Atlantic warned in a statement."The situation is deteriorating at 
pace and the airline has seen several days of negative bookings, driven by a huge volume of cancellations as 
customers choose to stay at home." 
A 'precarious future' is looming Photo: AFP / John MACDOUGALL British no-frills carrier EasyJet warned it may 
have to ground "the majority" of its fleet, urging governments across Europe to help their airlines maintain access to 
liquidity.EasyJet CEO Johan Lundgren added: "European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that 
coordinated government backing will be required to ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate 
when the crisis is over."Irish budget carrier Ryanair meanwhile did not rule out a full grounding as it unveiled 
stinging flight cutbacks.As part of its drastic action, IAG said it was "cutting non-essential and non-cyber related IT 
spend, freezing recruitment and discretionary spending, implementing voluntary leave options, temporarily 
suspending employment contracts and reducing working hours".IAG added that a management shake-up had been 
put on hold, noting that Willie Walsh would remain as chief executive.Walsh had been due to step down on March 
26, to be replaced by Iberia CEO Luis Gallego. And it's not just the airlines that are in trouble Photo: AFP / Frederic 
J. BROWN Air France will meanwhile slash flight capacity by 70-90 percent over the next two months, while 
Austrian Airlines will suspend all flights from Thursday, and Finnair is cutting 90 percent of capacity until the 
situation improves.The German government on Monday said it is planning to shield companies from going under 
because of the pandemic, by suspending legal obligations for firms facing acute liquidity problems to file for 
bankruptcy.German tourism and hotel group TUI said it was applying for state aid to keep it afloat, as it suspended

the "majority" of its operations.Back in London, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson signalled that 
the government would examine help for affected businesses, not just airlines, via Her Majesty's Revenue and 
Customs (HMRC) -- which is Britain's tax authority."HMRC is ready to help all businesses including airlines 
experiencing temporary financial difficulties due to coronavirus," Johnson's spokesman told AFP.Stephen Innes, 
markets strategist at AxiCorp, drew a contrast with the global financial crisis which sparked bank bailouts.However, 
as G7 finance ministers prepare to discuss the crisis later Monday, Innes argued that airlines were not the only 
strategic companies calling for assistance this time."This is not 2008. Back then it was the banks, this time the 
banks' balance sheets are fine," Innes said."But this is a global economic crisis which needs swap lines to airline 
companies, oil companies and retailers ."Airlines might be at the top of the list for directed fiscal help, but virtually 
every global industry is facing pressure without a government bailout," he added.US airlines have also announced 
drastic reductions in flights after President Donald Trump's administration banned foreign travellers arriving from 
Europe.United Airlines said it would announce a cut in capacity of around 50 percent for April and May, as the 
United States ramps up restrictions to try and contain the spread of the coronavirus."We also now expect these 
deep cuts to extend into the summer travel period," said United chief executive Oscar Munoz in a letter to 
employees published Sunday.American Airlines said it would reduce all international capacity by 75 percent, while 
competitors Delta and Southwest Airlines plan to strip back flights.

Three airline alliances that group almost 60 carriers called on Monday for governments to come to the aviation 
sector's rescue, while a growing number of airlines announced drastic flight reductions due to plummeting air travel 
demand over the coronavirus pandemic.
Governments must consider "all possible means" to aid the airline industry that is suffering from the coronavirus 
crisis, the airline alliances Oneworld, SkyTeam and Star Alliance said in a joint statement.
The three groups account for more than half of the global market. They said the current industry forecast of 113 
billion dollars in lost revenues this year is still too optimistic, given the most recent US restrictions for European 
travellers.
The Lufthansa Group announced further reductions to its already stripped-back service, under which just one in 10 
long-haul flights will now operate and one in five short and medium-haul flights.
The German airline says it will continue running flights to bring holidaymakers back to their home country. Together 
with its Eurowings subsidiary, Lufthansa returned around 6,000 passengers with more than 20 flights at the 
weekend.
"Now it is no longer about the economic issues, but rather the responsibility which airlines carry as part of the 
critical infrastructure in their home countries," Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr said.
Last week the group - whose airlines include Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Eurowings and Brussels - announced 
services would be cut worldwide by up to half of the average of 3,200 flights a day.
Meanwhile, Lufthansa Cargo said it has successfully been able to continue operating cargo flights amid the crisis.
Global airline alliances plea for state help, carriers slash flights
Earlier, Air France-KLM said it would reduce seat capacity by 75 to 90 per cent in the coming two months. Air 
France would ground its Airbus 380 fleet, while KLM was to ground its Boeing 747 fleet.
Talks were also to open with employee representatives due to the "expected decline in activity," the airline said.
The parent company of British Airways, IAG, said it would reduce capacity in April and May by at least 75 per cent.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said he expected demand to "remain weak until well into the summer."
"We will continue to monitor demand levels and we have the flexibility to make further cuts if necessary," Walsh 
said.
Low-cost airline easyJet said it has made "further significant cancellations."
The suspension of flights "will continue on a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding 
of the majority of the easyJet fleet," the airline said.
"European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that coordinated government backing will be required to 
ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over," said easyJet CEO Johan 
Lundgren.
Budget carrier Ryanair also said it expected to ground most of its fleet across Europe over the next seven to 10 
days.
"For April and May, Ryanair now expects to reduce its seat capacity by up to 80 per cent, and a full grounding of the 
fleet cannot be ruled out," it said.
German holiday airline Condor meanwhile said that is has cancelled a number of flights to favourite tourist 
destinations to which German citizens are no longer allowed to travel.
Flights to the United States, the Dominican Republic, Turkey and Morocco are affected, to varying degrees. Condor 
is to send empty planes to affected destinations in the next few days to bring back holidaymakers.
In the Nordic region, Finnair, Scandinavian carrier SAS, and low-cost Norwegian Air also announced they would 
slash capacity by 90 per cent.
Finnish flag carrier Finnair aimed to "maintain the most critical air connections for Finland also in this exceptional 
situation," said Topi Manner, chief executive.
Norwegian Air said on Monday it would cancel most flights and temporarily lay off about 90 per cent of its staff, 
about 7,300 employees, over "stagnating demand and enforced travel restrictions."
SAS said on Sunday it would temporarily lay off 90 per cent of its staff, about 10,00 employees, and halt most of its 
flights.

Several major European airlines on Monday said they would reduce their flights by up to 90 per cent amid the sharp 
fall in demand for air travel over the coronavirus pandemic.
Air France-KLM noted that "some countries have imposed constraints on the movement of travellers from France, 
the Netherlands or more broadly from Europe," affecting travel opportunities.
Air France would ground its Airbus 380 fleet, while KLM was to ground its Boeing 747 fleet.
The airline said it would reduce the number of available seat kilometres (ASK) - a measure for passenger carrying 
capacity - by 75 to 90 per cent in the coming two months.
Talks were also to open with employee representatives due to the "expected decline in activity."
Air France-KLM Group welcomed statements by the French and Dutch governments on means to support the 
group.
The parent company of British Airways, IAG, said it would reduce capacity in April and May by at least 75 per cent.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said he expected demand to "remain weak until well into the summer."
"We will continue to monitor demand levels and we have the flexibility to make further cuts if necessary," Walsh 
said.
Low-cost airline easyJet said it has made "further significant cancellations."

The suspension of flights "will continue on a rolling basis for the foreseeable future and could result in the grounding 
of the majority of the easyJet fleet," the airline said.
"European aviation faces a precarious future and it is clear that coordinated government backing will be required to 
ensure the industry survives and is able to continue to operate when the crisis is over," said easyJet CEO Johan 
Lundgren.
Budget carrier Ryanair also said it expected to ground most of its fleet across Europe over the next seven to 10 
days.
"For April and May, Ryanair now expects to reduce its seat capacity by up to 80 per cent, and a full grounding of the 
fleet cannot be ruled out," it said.
German holiday airline Condor meanwhile said that is has cancelled a number of flights to favourite tourist 
destinations to which German citizens are no longer allowed to travel.
Flights to the United States, the Dominican Republic, Turkey and Morocco are affected, to varying degrees. Condor 
is to send empty planes to affected destinations in the next few days to bring back holidaymakers.
"We'll fly empty to Turkey to bring the people back home," a Condor spokeswoman said in Frankfurt, adding that 
the airline was in close cooperation with travel agents who have cancelled a large number of package holidays.
Finnish flag carrier Finnair said it will slash its capacity by 90 per cent from April 1. As of Monday until end of March 
up to 2,000 flights would be cancelled.
The airline aimed to "maintain the most critical air connections for Finland also in this exceptional situation," said 
Topi Manner, chief executive.
Scandinavian carrier SAS said Sunday it would temporarily lay off 90 per cent of its staff, about 10,00 employees, 
and halt most of its flights.
Last week the Lufthansa Group - whose airlines include Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Eurowings and Brussels - 
announced services would be cut worldwide by up to half of the average of 3,200 flights a day.
Lufthansa said it was in talks with several European governments about state support to help it through the air 
travel crisis.

The daughter of billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been exposed to the new coronavirus and has isolated 
herself at her Omaha home for two weeks.               
Susie Buffett told the Omaha World-Herald on Sunday that she feels fine and doesn't think she's contracted 
COVID-19, which is caused by the virus that originated in China.               
She says she's not the least bit worried and says she hopes talking about her exposure brings down the fear in 
other people. She also says she hasn't been around her 89-year-old father, Warren, since her exposure last week.

Mar 16, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Most major 
global airlines could go bankrupt in the coming months as bookings drop due to coronavirus concerns, an Australia-
based consultancy warned Monday."Coordinated government and industry action is needed — now — if 
catastrophe is to be avoided," the CAPA Centre for Aviation said. "Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets 
are grounded, and what flights there are operate much less than half full."Major airlines have had to cut flights and 
employees, as the coronavirus takes its toll on the industry. 
Low-cost carrier Ryanair announced Monday that it would ground most of its fleet over the next seven to 10 days. 
United Airlines also announced[1] that it is cutting 50% of its flying capacity in April and May. In addition, American 
Airlines willsuspend 75% of its international long-haul flights.On Friday, Delta Air Lines announceda capacity 
reduction of 40% [2]within the next few months. The company will also be cutting all flights to Europe for the next 30 
days.U.S.-based airlines are seeking more than $50 billion[3] in assistance from Washington amid the crisis. The 
Trump administration is mulling a financial package that would help airlines, cruise lines and other parts of the 
private sector. Treasury Steven Mnuchin has claimed that this is not a 'bailout' for the travel industry."I want to be 
clear, this is not bailouts, we are not looking for bailouts,' Mnuchin told lawmakers[4] Wednesday. 'There may be 
specific industries that are highly impacted by travel that have issues with lending.''I would assume the airlines 
would be on the top of the list," he continued. U.S.-based airlines employ roughly750,000 people.There are 
currently over 3,800 cases of coronavirus in the U.S., with the death toll topping 70. More than 6,500 people 
worldwide have been killed by the virus. [ 1]: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-airlines-coronavirus-flights-half-

Ryanair Does Not Rule Out Grounding Entire Fleet as Coronavirus Pandemic Hits Aviation Industry With Travel

Ryanair Does Not Rule Out Grounding Entire Fleet as Coronavirus Pandemic 
Hits Aviation Industry With Travel Restrictions

Body
 Ryanair (RYAAY), Europe's biggest budget airline, said early on Monday capacity cuts of up to 80% were on the 
cards and a full grounding of the fleet could not be "ruled out" because of the COVID-19 global pandemic and 
associated government travel restrictions.
Over the past seven days, countries such as Italy, Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Poland and Norway have 
imposed flight bans of varying degrees to and from countries with a high risk of the coronavirus infections, the 
carrier said in a statement. Poland and Norway have banned all international flights.
"Ryanair expects the result of these restrictions will be the grounding of the majority of its aircraft fleet across 
Europe over the next 7 to 10 days," the company said. "In those countries where the fleet is not grounded, social 
distancing restrictions may make flying to all intents and purposes, impractical, if not, impossible."
The low-cost airline also said that "immediate action" was being taken to lower operating expenses and improve 
cash flows. Apart from grounding surplus aircraft, the company has deferred all capital expenditure and share 
buybacks.

Highlight: Fund managers are counting the cost of their holdings in airline companies as shares in the travel sector 
have plunged amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Body
Fund managers are counting the cost of their holding in airline companies as shares in the travel sector have 
plunged amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Airline stocks are among the hardest in today’s renewed heavy falls across stock markets. British Airways owner 
International Consolidated Airlines (IAG) has fallen to the bottom of the FTSE 100 today, losing a quarter of its 
value, while EasyJet (EZJ) is down 16.8%, ‘mid-cap’ airline stock Wizz Air (WIZZ) has fallen 20.2% and on the 
Alternative Investment Market, Dart Group (DTG), which operates the Jet2 airline, is down 40%.
Over the last month, International Consolidated Airlines is down 59%, nearly double the FTSE 100’s 30% loss. 
EasyJet has fallen 56%, Wizz Air has halved in value and Dart Group is down 73%.
That has hurt a number of fund managers backing the stocks. Neil Veitch and Craig Jeruzal’s SVM UK 
Opportunties  fund has been among the heaviest fallers in the Investment UK All Companies sector in the sell-off, 
losing 30.5% in the 15 trading days to Friday.
The managers held 5.7% of the £115m fund in Ryanair (RYA.I), down 40% over the last month, 4.1% in Wizz Air 
and 3.9% in IAG at the end of February, according to the latest factsheet.
SVM World Equity , also managed by Veitch, has an even larger Ryanair holding, at 6.1%% of the £19m fund at the 
end of February. The factsheet for the fund group’s SVM All Europe SRI  fund also shows a 3.3% position in Wizz 
Air at the end of February.
British Airways owner IAG is a feature of some larger funds. The stock accounts for 3.5% of the Artemis UK Select  
fund, run by Ed Legget, according to the latest factsheet to the end of February, and 3.3% of the £1.3bn Man GLG 
UK Income  run by Citywire AA-rated Henry Dixon.
David Jehan holds 3.1% of his £280m Fidelity Enhanced Income  fund in the stock.
The popular £1.2bn Castlefield CFP SDL UK Buffettology  fund, run by Citywire AA-rated Keith Ashworth-Lord is 
meanwhile among Dart’s shareholders, with a 3.7% position at the end of February.
Funds count cost as airlines nosedive in coronavirus crash
Citywire AAA-rated Harry Nimmo meanwhile held 3.5% of his  £1.7bn ASI UK Smaller Companies  fund in the stock 
at the end of January, according to the latest factsheet.
From bad to worse
The airline sector did not enter the coronavirus sell-off in the healthiest of positions and is an industry well-known 
for being heavily indebted with ‘a poor track record for seeing through crises’, said Russ Mould, investment director 
at AJ Bell. 
Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said ‘at the best of times, the airline industry is cyclical, and 
at the worst of times is squarely in the firing line’ as revenues fall but fixed costs remain. 
IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, who has delayed his retirement to deal with the crisis, warned of a plan to reduce 
capacity by 75% for April and May and the need for severe cost cuts, including reducing employee hours.
The group said it had €7.35bn in cash andl €1.9bn of undrawn credit backed by aircraft but has not provided any 
profit guidance for the year as the impact of the outbreak is uncertain. There were similar announcements from 
Ryanair and Easyjet, both of which are grounding flights, and have declined to estimate the impact of the virus.
William Ryder, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the slew of negative announcements ‘show the 
severity of the coronavirus threat to airlines’. 
‘The key will now be balance sheet liquidity and the ability to flexibly control costs to preserve cash,’ he said. 
Emergency funding
The length of the disruption to air travel is the key risk for investors, said Ian Forrest, analyst at The Share Centre. 
He said the main worry was whether it continued for ‘more than a few months’ but following the large drops in the 
share prices ‘there is a lot of bad news already priced in and it is unlikely that most of the restrictions will be in place 
for more than six months’.
Mould predicted airlines would need access to ‘significant levels of funding, be it lines of credit or chunky cash piles’ 
and predicted shareholders would have to ‘wave goodbye to any dividends’ and there would be no share buybacks 
on the books despite the stocks falling to lows. 
‘The market is pricing in a significant decline in earnings and the situation looks like it could get even worse as more 
countries go into full-blown lockdown,’ said Mould. 
Industry body,the Centre for Aviation, has issued a stark warning to governments about the need to bail out airlines. 
It said ‘by the end of May 2020, most airlines in the world will be bankrupt’ and ‘co-ordinated government and 
industry action is needed now if catastrophe is to be avoided’. 
The organisation said many airlines were already in ‘technical bankruptcy’ and at the least were ‘substantially in 
breach of debt covenants’ as cash reserves are depleted by grounded flights.
‘Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon,’ it said. 
The coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed over 6,600 lives and infected more than 173,000 people, has 
prompted countries around the world to go into lockdown. Spain followed Italy into a state of emergency over the 
weekend that means its 47m citizens will have to stay indoors, and the US has imposed travel bans on those 
coming from Europe.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported cases in 144 countries and as a result the UK’s Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office has warned British citizens against all but essential travel to 35 countries. 
Funds count cost as airlines nosedive in coronavirus crash
The restrictions on movement have put huge pressure on airline and travel companies across the globe, with Flybe 
in the UK already going bankrupt as the outbreak pushed the already ailing airline over the edge.

 UK carriers are seeking government aid as the US expanded restrictions on European travelers to the UK and 
Ireland, Reuters reported Monday, citing an industry body.
Airlines UK, a trade body for airlines such as International Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG.L) British Airways, 
Virgin Atlantic Airways, Norwegian Air Shuttle and Ryanair Holdings (RYA.L), said the time for action from the 
government is now.
"We're talking about the future of UK aviation - one of our world-class industries - and unless government pulls itself 
together who knows what will be left of it once we get out of this mess," Airlines UK added.
The government has been in discussions with airline industry leaders, with further talks expected this week, the 
newswire reported.
IAG shares plunged more than 25% on Monday afternoon, while Ryanair shares tanked 17%.

 Virgin Group Chairman Peter Norris plans to urge UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to provide about 7.5 billion 
pounds sterling ($9.27 billion) in funding to help the country's airline industry survive, Sky News reported on 
Sunday, citing sources.
The request will come as British Airways (BA.L), Virgin Atlantic, easyJet (EZJ.L) and Ryanair (RYA.L) are expected 
to ground their aircrafts amid the growing spread of COVID-19.
The credit facility, which will be repaid when trading returns to normal, would include cash advances and 
guarantees and other measures to ensure that credit card companies do not amass revenue from airline bookings.
Norris plans to repay the emergency financing once trading returns to normal levels.
The letter will also include a request for airlines to keep planes grounded without losing their take-off and landing 
slots for the grounding period.
Ryanair's shares rose about 4% at the close of market on Friday.

calling for a multibillion-pound emergency bailout to stop the industry being destroyed by the coronavirus. See

[4] Coronavirus: the pros and cons of closing schools[5] Trade body Airlines UK has called for urgent action, saying 
the government's 'prevarication' and 'bean counting' had to stop. The chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways' majority 
shareholder, Virgin Group, will write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson today to warn that the sector needs immediate 
financial aid of up to 7.5bn[6]to stay afload amid the ongoing pandemic. The Guardian[7] reports the funding could 
include 'cash advances and guarantees' that credit card companies will not 'withhold millions of pounds relating to 
payments that their customers have made for future flights and holidays'. Sky News[8] adds that this week could be 
'the bloodiest week in British aviation history', with British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, easyJet and Ryanair all expected 
to announce 'mass groundings of aircraft and potentially huge redundancies' as the pandemic continues. -#8212;-

facing a 'crisis of global proportions' that was worse than that caused by the 2003SARS outbreak[11]or the 9/11 
terror attacks on New York. In a memo titled 'The Survival of British Airways'[12], BA boss Alex Cruz said that the 
airline is to ground flights 'like never before'. 'This crisis is going to be grim,' said Jon Horne, president of the 
European Cockpit Association, which represents more than 40,000 European pilots.'It is neither a Gulf War, nor 
Sars, nor 9/11, or the 2008 financial crisis, but all of them together.' The call for aid comes after the US announced 
that it will extend its ban on travel from the European Union to include the UK and Republic of Ireland. The 
extended ban, which will begin tomorrow, will hit vital routes for British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian Air. 
American Airlines has already announced that it is suspending nearly all of its long-haul international flights from 
today. A UK government spokesman said: 'We recognise how difficult the current situation is for the aviation sector

Lufthansa subsidiary Austrian Airlines and Ryanair group carrier Lauda say they are ceasing all regular flights as 
the coronavirus pandemic has slashed demand and triggered travel restrictions.
Austrian Airlines says that two of its 83 aircraft will remain on standby to repatriate Austrians from abroad if needed 
during the flight suspension that is scheduled to end on March 28.
Vienna-based budget carrier Lauda has grounded all of its aircraft and plans to resume operations on April 9.

       Ryanair Holdings plc (RYA.L) said it expects to reduce its seat capacity by up to 80% in April and May, due to 
impact of the deadly coronavirus crisis. It warns that they may be forced to ground all of their flights.
 Ryanair expects result of travel restrictions will be the grounding of the majority of its aircraft fleet across Europe 
over the next 7 to 10 days. In those countries where the fleet is not grounded, social distancing restrictions may 
make flying to all intents and purposes, impractical, if not, impossible.
 Ryanair said it is taking immediate action to reduce operating expenses, and improve cash flows. This will involve 
grounding surplus aircraft, deferring all capex and share buybacks, freezing recruitment and discretionary spending, 
and implementing a series of voluntary leave options, temporarily suspending employment contracts, and significant 
reductions to working hours and payments.

https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/news/europes-biggest-customers-are-now-gone-what-next/Europe is one of the 
world's richest continents. The European Union with its 28 members and 500 million residents is considered as the 
global superpower, a well-sophisticated market with good education, healthcare, and financial industries.It attracts 
tens of billions in investments every year and is home to some of the biggest financial centers globally. 
London, Paris, and Zurich are hubs of immense significance for the rest of the world. Besides being a global 
economic powerhouse in finance, Europe also is home to some of the most visited countries on earth. France is the 
number one on the list globally while Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, and others are also included. In the 
meantime, the British capital of London is the most visited city in the world. With such scales, Europe accounts for a 
big part of international and domestic flights. Continent's ultra-low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Wizzair further 
contribute to high mobility across European nations. However, the majority of spendings in the EU is made by 
overseas visitors. More particularly, amid the rapid development of Asian economies, China has become one of the 
biggest customers of the EU services. As of 2016, over 25 million visits were made by Chinese visitors within the 
EU[1]. Besides the already high yet ever-increasing number, they also are big spenders. For comparison, tourists 
from other European nations do not spend nearly as much as those from China. Moreover, the majority of flight 
operators from China into the EU are European. This is particularly important as aviation is a major branch of the 
economy for the European Union.COVID-19: what EU industries does it affect and how exactlyDependency on 
Chinese investments and visitors is having devastating consequences for Europe amid the global novel coronavirus 
outbreak. Originating in China, the new type of coronavirus has already spread across the west, including Europe. 
There are now more than 10,000 cases of the virus in Italy while others like Spain, France, and Germany are also 
witnessing a soaring trend. Direct services were soon suspended from China as the nation's Hubei province went 
into a strict lockdown. The further spread of the virus led to a drop in international travel as an increasing number of 
industries warn about the potential major crisis. So which fields are most affected?Entertainment and gamblingThe 
entertainment industry is one of the most affected ones. Leisure venues all across Europe are facing the lack of 
visitors and some are fearing closure due to the current circumstances. The gambling industry is struggling as well. 
Casinos are widespread in European countries and some areas, like Monaco, are highly dependent on revenues 
generated by gambling venues. Physical casinos come with higher risks due to bodily contacts among staff 
members and visitors. In the meantime, online gambling platforms are taking their chances to substitute famous 
Europe's biggest customers are now gone - what next?
European venues amid the crisis. Bonus offers are being widely promoted on the web to attract more people to 
such platforms. Playamo casino is one of the most popular ones that is visited by a soaring number of people each 
day. Their Playamo casino bonus offer[2] is very popular among players online. Some of those who have used it 
say that the variety of options and possibilities on such platforms is often more attractive than bonuses themselves. 
Online casinos are actively trying to maintain the growth and the current crisis seems to be beneficial for 
them.AirlinesCarriers all around the world were forced to cancel thousands of flights[3] while some services had to 
be completely suspended amid the COVID-19 spread into Europe. At first, flights were stopped from China, a major 
hit for the industry. Airlines such as British and KLM used to operate tens of flights daily between Chinese cities and 
their European hubs. Norwegian Air recently announced that they would cancel 3,000 flights or roughly 15% of their 
entire capacity in the coming months. British Airways always stopped all flights to and out of Italy shortly followed by 
popular low-cost Ryanair. The crisis is also affecting the domestic market as the demand for travel shrinks 
dramatically. American Airlines became one of the first US carriers to reduce domestic capacity in response to the 
outbreak. Moreover, airports across Europe are already reporting plummeting passenger traffic as airlines are 
operating almost-empty ghost flights. London Heathrow, Europe's largest and one of the world's busiest airports 
reported a 5% decrease in passenger numbers[4] this February and March.Accommodation: hotels under a major 
threatRevenue of hotels and other means of accommodation are directly connected to tourism and travel industries. 
As international mobility decreases in spite of the novel coronavirus outbreak, hotels all across Europe are facing 
closures and cancellations. Short-time online rental platforms, such as AIRBNB also reported plunging booking 
rates in February and early March. The issue is particularly visible in Italy, one of Europe's biggest tourism hotspots, 
which now sits under a nation-wide lockdown. Almost no hotels operate in Northern while the media is reporting 
pictures of empty streets in Venice and Milano. Read more: Europe's biggest customers are now gone - what

Milan, Italy, Sunday, March 15, 2020, as most people remained home following the indications of doctors and the

only mild or moderate symptoms. For some, it can cause more severe illness, especially in older adults and people 
with existing health problems. 
(Claudio Furlan/LaPresse via AP)The Latest on financial markets (all times local): The daughter of billionaire 
investor Warren Buffett has been exposed to the new coronavirus and has isolated herself at her Omaha home for 
two weeks. Susie Buffett told the Omaha World-Herald on Sunday that she feels fine and doesn't think she's 
contracted COVID-19, which is caused by the virus that originated in China. She says she's not the least bit worried 
and says she hopes talking about her exposure brings down the fear in other people. She also says she hasn't 
been around her 89-year-old father, Warren, since her exposure last week. ___ Major airlines are scaling back 
flights dramatically in response to the coronavirus crisis that has seen Europe and the wider world go into lockdown. 
Budget airline EasyJet said it is making big cancellations that will continue on a rolling basis. It said that could result 
in the grounding of the majority of its fleet.  BA's parent company, IAG, which also owns Spain's Iberia, said that for 
April and May it plans to reduce capacity by at least 75% from the previous year. It also said it is reducing operating 
expenses, including through voluntary leave options. Ryanair, Europe's busiest airline, said it expects to ground the 
majority of its fleet across Europe over the next 7-10 days. Travel company Tui is suspending the vast majority of 
travel operations until further notice, including package travel, cruises and hotel operations. A day earlier, United 
Airlines had said it needs to cut flying capacity by 50% in April and May, while American Airlines announced a 75% 
cut to international flights. ___ The Swedish government presented Monday an economic package that will allow all 
firms in Sweden to defer tax payments for up to a year. (Ad) Simple formula reveals how to make every trade a safe 
one.  The package is expected to cost more than 300 billion kronor ($21 billion), or some 6% of GDP.  The center-

Alfa Romeo and Maserati nameplates as well as a plant in Serbia that makes the Fiat 500L and one in Poland that

loans for companies that are running short of cash due to the virus outbreak. Brent crude, the international oil 
standard, fell almost 9% while gold gained. Futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials fell 5%, triggering a

Mar 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The dreaded 
coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on Mar 11, has 
been a nightmare for stocks, keeping investors on the edge.Due to his health hazard, which has claimed multiple 
lives apart from infecting many more across the globe, the S&P 500, Nasdaq and the Dow Jones plunged to their 
historic lows on Mar 12, resulting in the end of the 11-year bull run.Due to coronavirus woes, the S&P 500, Nasdaq 
and the Dow Jones have tanked 16.1%, 12.2% and 18.8%, respectively, so far this year, paring last year's 
impressive gains.Play Video[1] Jolted Airlines Take Actions to Meet Dwindling DemandEven though coronavirus-
related fears have rattled most sectors, travel-focused stocks, which include airlines, have borne the brunt of the 
outbreak. Evidently, the ZacksAirline[2]industry has shed 35.9% of its value since the commencement of February 
compared with the S&P 500 index's loss of 15.9% in the same time frame.With international travel demand 
dwindling due to the rapid spread of this highly infectious disease, airline stocks are getting clobbered. With the 
disease spreading to countries like Italy, South Korea, Iran, the United States and Germany, many people are 
unwilling to fly to stay safe and avoid contracting the disease from a fellow passenger.In a bid to fight coronavirus-
led low demand for air-travel, airlines from all corners of the globe are trimming their capacity. 
With Italy suffering the most due to COVID-19 in Europe, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3], sporting a 
Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy), lowered its 2020 traffic forecast by 3 million to 151 million. Also, Air France KLM AFLYY[4] 
suspended all its flights to/from Italy from Mar 14 through Apr 3.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 
Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.[5]Airline companies based in the United States too have resorted to various 
measures for tackling the coronavirus-led sharp drop in demand. Evidently, Delta Air Lines DAL[6] will slash overall 
capacity by 40% in the next few months, the highest in its history, including 2001, as air travel demand sees a rapid 
fall and revenues take a hit. Moreover, American Airlines AAL[7] aims to cut international flights by 75% to match 
the extremely-low demand scenario. United Airlines UAL[8] aims to trim capacity by almost 50% in April and 
May.Also, to combat the drop in demand, airlines are reducing capital expenses, discretionary operating costs as 
well as suspending share buybacks.More Turbulence Down the Road?Even though the 30-day ban on travel to the 
United States from 26[9] European countries announced last week by President Trump (expanded subsequently to 
include UK and Ireland) is aimed at preventing further spread of the disease, the development implies a further 
setback to the already beleaguered airline stocks. Moreover, a ban on domestic air travel is also being 
reportedly[10] considered to prevent the spread.With demand fast-disappearing and the scenario unlikely to 
Airlines Brought to Their Knees by Coronavirus: What's Ahead?
improve at least in the near term, first-quarter earnings are likely to be hurt severely by this pandemic. For instance, 
United Airlines, which has already withdrawn its guidance for first-quarter 2020 and the full year as well, expects 
March revenues to be $1.5 billion lower than March 2019. Also, Southwest Airlines LUV[11] recently issued a 
bearish unit revenue guidance for the March quarter due to coronavirus-led low demand. First-quarter operating 
revenues are expected to decline between $200 and $300 million.Moreover, the International Air Transport 
Association currently expects airline passenger revenues for 2020 to be hurt in the $63-$113 billion 
band.ConclusionThe above write-up indicates in no uncertain terms that the airline industry, which even before the 
coronavirus outbreak was suffering from issues like prolonged grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets, has been dealt a 
body-blow. What is more alarming is that the situation is likely to get worse at least in the near term. With the 
adversity showing no signs of abating, revenues in the upcoming summer season, usually considered to be the 
busiest time for U.S. airlines, are likely to be hit badly.In a bid to help U.S. airlines combat this unprecedented crisis, 
the U.S. administration is considering[12] financial help to airlines. Watch this space for further updates on the 
coronavirus and its resultant impact on the airline industry.Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see

Mar 16, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Latest on the coronavirus 
pandemic, which has infected more than 169,000 people and killed more than 6,500. The COVID-19 illness causes 
mild or moderate symptoms but most people, but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or people with 
existing health problems. More than 77,000 people have recovered from it so far, mostly in China. ___ Hungary's 
prime minister says the country is closing its borders to foreigners and only citizens will be allowed in. Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban said Monday in Parliament that international coordination about the border closures is 
underway. 
Orban also said all bars, restaurants and shops will have to close daily at 3 p.m., with only food stores, pharmacies 
and drug stores allowed to stay open longer. Cinemas, cultural institutions and nightclubs will also be closed, while 
sporting events can still be held if organizers assume responsibility, but only without spectators. Schools were 
closed to students on Monday, with distance learning programs starting to be implemented. So far, 30 people in 
Hungary have been infected with one virus-related death. ___ European Union leaders will hold a video-conference 
summit on efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, which has now infected around 40,000 people across 
Europe, and claimed some 2,000 lives. EU Council President Charles Michel, who chairs summits of prime 
ministers and presidents from the 27 EU nations, said via Twitter on Monday that he was calling on Tuesday what 
will be the second meeting of its kind in two weeks. 'Containing the spread of the virus, providing sufficient medical 
equipment, boosting research and limiting the economic fallout is key,' Michel tweeted. The EU is urging its member 
countries to put common health screening procedures in place at their borders to limit the spread of the virus, but 
not to block the transport of important medical equipment. (Ad) If you own a cell phone, then mobile service 
providers hope you never get to see this video going viral. It was shot in downtown Denver by a multi-millionaire, 
who exposed sensitive truths about cell phones and 5G. His experiment will strike a bad chord with cell phone 
companies, I know. But you've got to see what this man 'leaked,' and what it means for phone users in the weeks 
ahead. ___ U.K.-based airlines, including British Airways and Ryanair, are scaling back flights dramatically in 
response to the coronavirus crisis that has seen Europe and the wider world go into lockdown. EasyJet said it is 
introducing "further significant cancellations" as a result of the restrictions and 'significantly reduced levels of 
customer demand.' It added that these will continue on 'a rolling basis for the foreseeable future' and could result in 
the grounding of most of its fleet.  BA's parent company IAG, which also owns Spain's Iberia, also announced plans 
to reduce capacity. For April and May, it said it plans to reduce capacity by at least 75% from the previous year. It 
also said it is reducing operating expenses, by grounding surplus aircraft and implementing voluntary leave options. 
And Ryanair said its expects that the restrictions will mean the grounding of the majority of its aircraft fleet across

Europe over the next seven to 10 days. __ China is relaxing travel restrictions in the hardest-hit virus province of 
Hubei, sending thousands of workers back to jobs at factories desperate to get production going again.  The official 
Xinhua News Agency reported Monday that cities just outside the epicenter ofWuhan were chartering buses to send 
back to work residents who had returned home for the Lunar New Year in late January.  The move comes as 
Chinese officials say the outbreak that spread from Wuhan starting in December has mostly run its course 
domestically, while they remain vigilant against imported cases.  The outbreak of COVID-19 has has a devastating 
effect on China's service sector and industries from autos to cell phones, although President Xi Jinping has pledged 
that economic growth targets for the year will still be met. Xinhua cited local officials as saying that 750,000 migrant 
workers alone in the city of Huangguang adjacent to Wuhan have been unable to return to their jobs. ___ Iranian 
state TV says the new coronavirus has killed another 129 people, pushing the country's death toll to 853 amid 
14,991 confirmed cases.  Iran is struggling to contain the worst outbreak in the Middle East. Monday saw the 
biggest one-day rise in the death toll since the epidemic began. Even senior officials have been infected. World 
Health Organization officials say that Iran's outbreak is being reported.  ___ All Disney owned hotels at Walt Disney 
World in Orlando, Florida, will close at 5 p.m. on March 20, the company announced Monday. The closure also 
includes Disney's Vero Beach Resort on Florida's Atlantic Coast. In a tweet, the company said the Friday closure 
will give guests the ability to make other arrangements. In addition, the company announced it is closing all Disney 
stores in North America, beginning Tuesday. Online shopping will still be available. ___ Liberia has announced its 
first COVID-19 case Monday as the executive director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Nathaniel Blama, 
among the first officials on the continent to contract the virus.  Blama came to Liberia from Switzerland on Friday. 
Information Minister Eugene Nagbe said 'there is no cause for panic' given measures put in place by the 
government to contact, trace, test and control any emergence of the virus. Liberia, along with its neighbors Sierra 
Leone and Guinea, were devastated Ebola outbreaks from 2014 to 2016 that killed more than 11,300 people, 
including 4,000 in Liberia alone. ___ Belgium's political parties have agreed to temporary put their differences aside 
to fight the coronavirus outbreak more efficiently. After months of failed negotiations, opposition parties agreed to 
grant Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes' caretaker government special powers for up to six months. Wilmes said late 
Sunday on Twitter that her team will be 'driven by a sense of duty. This great union is up to the challenges of the 
moment.' Belgium has been in a political impasse for months after last May's general election exposed deep 
linguistic and regional divisions in the country. Belgium's first female prime minister, Wilmes was appointed in 
October to succeed liberal leader Charles Michel, who became president of the European Council. In an attempt to 
stop the spreading of the COVID-19 virus, Wilmes' government has closed schools, bars and restaurants and 
suspended all sports and cultural events. Belgium has 1,085 confirmed cases and four deaths. ___ The Czech 
Interior Ministry is calling on all citizens to use any face protection available, especially while shopping and using 
the public transport.  'Any protection is better than no protection,' the ministry said. It advised people to stay at 
home, if possible. Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech acknowledged over the weekend that the medical sector 
lacks up to a million respirators. The government has banned traveling across the country, starting Monday. People 
still can travel to work, visit doctors or do shopping. The Czech Republic has 298 COVID-19 cases. ___ South 
Africa will revoke nearly 10,000 visas issued this year to people from China and Iran, and visas will now be required 
for other high-risk countries that had been visa-free, including Italy and the United States.  Health Minister Zweli 
Mkhize says a lockdown might be necessary if tough new measures announced Sunday, including travel 
restrictions and school closings, don't work. He warns of a high risk of internal virus transmission with "the problem 
of inequality in our society."  South Africans worry about the spread of the virus to crowded townships or public 
transport. Confirmed virus cases have doubled every two days over 10 days to 61, a rate he called "explosive."  
Elsewhere, Africa's second most populous nation, Ethiopia, has suspended schools, sporting events and other 
large gatherings for 15 days.  ___ Bavarian authorities say that runoff mayoral elections in the southern German 
state will be conducted entirely by postal vote to reduce risks of infection with the new coronavirus. Polling stations 
opened as usual, though with increased hygienic precautions, for the first round of municipal elections on Sunday. 
On Monday, though, Bavaria's state government tightened its restrictions on public life, saying that it would close 
bars, cinemas and some shops among other things. The regional interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said that the 
runoff votes in two weeks will be held 'exclusively by postal ballot.'  Among the cities and towns where a runoff vote 
will be needed is the state capital, Munich, where center-left mayor Dieter Reiter fell narrowly short of the 50% 
support needed to avoid a second round. ___ The government of Kosovo has declared the state of emergency due 
to the coronavirus threat. Kosovo has 13 COVID-19 cases. It has closed all its borders and suspended flights from 
its only international airport. The government has closed all schools, cafes, restaurants and gyms and banned mass

gatherings. ___ Greece's Olympic committee says the handover ceremony for the Olympic flame for the Tokyo 
games scheduled this Thursday will take place behind closed doors as part of efforts to contain the coronavirus 
outbreak. The Hellenic Olympic Committee said the accreditation cards that had been issued for the ceremony at 
the Athens Panaetenaic Stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896, will not be valid. The HOC's 
headquarters will also be closed from Monday until further notice, it added. Last week, the committee canceled the 
remainder of the Olympic torch relay after crowds gathered in Sparta in southern Greece to watch part of the torch 
relay, where the torch was carried by actor Gerard Butler.  ___ Germany has partially closed its borders with five 
neighbors, leading to queues at some crossings. German police launched new controls at the usually check-free 
borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Denmark on Monday. Police turned back some 
pedestrians at Kehl, across the Rhine river from the French city of Strasbourg. People who commute across the 
border to work are still allowed to cross, as can trucks carrying goods, and Germans are being allowed back in. But 
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that people 'without a valid reason to travel' wouldn't be allowed across. That, 
for example, ends trips to shops across the border for now. Denmark shut own border over the weekend - as did 
two eastern neighbors of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Lithuania's government said a convoy of some 
500 vehicles -- mostly Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and Ukrainians -- will be allowed to enter Poland from 
Germany and transit toward Lithuania on Monday. Germany has confirmed over 4,800 infections with the new 
coronavirus, including 12 deaths. ___ Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced Monday that it is suspending 
production across most of its European plants through March 27. The Italian-American carmaker is closing six 
plants in Italy that make cars under the Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Maserati nameplates as well as a plant in Serbia that 
makes the Fiat 500L and in Poland that makes the Fiat 500. The closure in Italy will affect lines producing the 
Panda sub-compact, the Jeep Renegade and Compact and the Alfa Romeo Giulia and Stelvio. ___ South Korea's 
central bank has executed an emergency rate cut of 0.5 percentage point to help ease the economic fallout from 
the coronavirus, which has sickened more than 8,200 people in the country. The Bank of Korea's move on Monday 
brought its policy rate to an all-time low of 0.75% amid concerns that the global spread of COVID-19 will rattle 
South Korea's trade-dependent economy. The bank says the rate cut will help ease volatility in financial markets 
and help pump money into the economy by lowering borrowing costs for companies. But some experts say it's 
unclear whether lower interest rates will meaningfully boost economic activity that's largely suppressed by 
preventive measures against the virus. ___ Bangladesh's government has shut down all all educational institutions 
and private tutorial centers across the country until March 31. Education Minister Dipu Moni said at a news 
conference Monday in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, that the measures were taken as a precautionary step against 
the coronavirus. Bangladesh confirmed three more cases of infection on Monday, taking the total to eight. ___ 
Czech authorities are ordering a lockdown of 21 towns and villages in an area some 250 kilometers (150 miles) 
east of the capital to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. The health authority in the nearby city of Olomouc 
barred residents from leaving those places and no one without residency can travel there. The extraordinary 
measure initially for two weeks includes confining people to their homes except to shop for food and medicine and 
go to and from work. The Czech Republic has 298 cases of infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. The 
measure comes just hours after the government banned traveling across the country. ___ Iranian news agencies 
say a 78-year-old member of the Iranian clerical body that chooses the country's supreme leader has died from the 
illness caused by the new coronavirus.  He was the latest of several senior Iranian officials to have been infected in 
the worsening outbreak. The outbreak has infected nearly 14,000 people in Iran and killed more than 700, with the 
toll jumping by more than a hundred in the last 24 hours. The real numbers may be even higher, as some have 
questioned the government's reporting. The semi-official Fars and Tasnim news agencies reported that Ayatollah 
Hashem Bathaei, a low-profile, moderate member of the Assembly of Experts, died from the COVID-19 illness. ___ 
Turkey is closing bars and nightclubs to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, 
meanwhile, reported on his Twitter account 12 more coronavirus cases, including seven people who had returned 
from European countries and three from the United States. The update raised Turkey's confirmed cases to 18. Bars 
and nightclubs will be temporarily closed as of Monday, the Interior Ministry said. Turkey has also suspended flights 
to several countries and closing schools and universities.  On Sunday, Turkey set up quarantine locations for more 
than 10,300 people returning from pilgrimages to Islam's holy sites in Saudi Arabia. ___ The Peace Corps is 
evacuating all of its volunteers and suspending operations in dozens of countries. Director Jody Olsen says 
Sunday's decision comes as "international travel becomes more and more challenging by the day." She said the 
agency wanted to avoid leaving volunteers stranded in host countries. As of September 2019, the service program 
run by the U.S. government said it operates in more than 60 countries and has more than 7,300 volunteers and 
The Latest: Hungary closes its borders to foreigners
trainees. Volunteers in China and Mongolia have already been evacuated over virus concerns. Olsen says host 
country staff will remain in their current roles. ___ ___ The Associated Press receives support for health and

Mar 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  United Airlines Holdings 
UAL[1] has provided an update on how deeply coronavirus is impacting its business, as the health crisis intensifies 
across the globe, including the United States, forcing the state and local governments to shut down schools and 
restricting people to their homes. Amid this turmoil, President Donald Trump announced fresh travel restrictions to 
the United Kingdom and Ireland over the last weekend.With a significant decline in travel demand as hesitant 
customers are avoiding air travel and following large-scale travel restrictions, the carrier transported more than one 
million fewer customers in just the first two weeks of March compared with the year-ago period, especially given 
that March is usually its busiest time of the year. As a result, the Chicago, IL-based airline expects March revenues 
to be down $1.5 billion year over year. 
In fact, the carrier anticipates the number of customers and revenues to decline sharply going forward.To mitigate 
the effects of the adversities, United Airlines is planning to reduce payroll expenses. To this end, the company will 
be slashing corporate officers' salaries by 50%. Additionally, the airline will cut back capacity for April and May by 
50%. The capacity reductions are expected to extend into the summer travel period. Despite the significant 
reduction in capacity, the airline expects load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) to fall in the 20-30% 
range, assuming things to worsen in the future.In addition to significant schedule reductions, the airline previously 
took measures such as freezing hiring (except for crucial roles), delaying 2019 merit salary increases, and giving 
employees the option to apply for voluntary, unpaid leave of absence to counteract the demand slump.Due to 
setback from coronavirus-induced low demand, shares of United Airlines have plunged 52.4% since the beginning 
of February compared with the industry[2]'s 37.7% decline.Zacks Rank & Key PicksUnited Airlines currently carries 
a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation[3] sector are Azul AZUL[4], 
Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[5] and GATX Corporation GATX[6]. While Azul and GATX sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong 
Buy), Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here[7].Each of the stocks has an impressive earnings history. Azul's earnings surpassed estimates in the 
preceding four quarters, with the average being 209%. Ryanair trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of 
the last four quarters and missed the same once, with the average positive surprise being 56.3%. GATX's earnings 
also outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 
21%.Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating

Mar 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Shares of Ryanair 
Holdings RYAAY[1] have lost 27.5% compared with the industry[2]'s 39.2% decline in the past month. Ryanair, like 
most other airline stocks, has been hit hard by the sharp drop in air-travel demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, 
resulting in the decline of the stock.Coronavirus-Led Woes in Italy Dwarf RyanairRyanair's primary market is Italy, 
which is now the worst-hit European country. Consequently, demand from this key market has dropped 
significantly. 
As a result, Ryanair, which had earlier decided to trim its capacity to/from Italy by 25% from Mar 17 to Apr 8, 
announced that it intends to suspend more domestic and international Italian flights through Apr 8.With demand 
anticipated to decline further, traffic and load factor are likely be 'lower than normal' in March and April. For April 
and May, Ryanair aims to trim capacity by up to 80%. In fact, the company aims to ground most of its aircraft in 
Europe over the next seven to 10 daysRyanair's CEO Michael O'Leary warned of a "meaningful impact" of the virus 
on fourth-quarter fiscal 2020 (ending Mar 31, 2020) results. Notably, due to low demand, Ryanair lowered its fiscal 
2020 traffic forecast by 3 million to 151 million.Ryanair is not the only carrier to have trimmed its capacity due to the 
viral outbreak. U.S.-based carriers including American Airlines AAL[3], United Airlines UAL[4] and Delta Air Lines 
DAL[5] also suspended various flights in the wake of the coronavirus onslaught.Buying Opportunity?However, many 
investors may view the sharp drop in Ryanair's stockprice as an opportunity to build position on the stock mainly 
due to its strong fundamentals. Additionally, the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings 
has been revised 4.3% upward over the past 60 days signifies that analysts have not lost confidence in the Ryanair 
stock.Also, its Momentum Score[6] of B highlights the stock's short-term attractiveness. Additionally, Ryanair carries 
a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks 
here.[7]Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating

Mar 16, 2020( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Delta Air Lines, Inc. 
DAL[1] will be slashing overall capacity by 40% in the next few months, the highest in its history, including 2001, as 
air travel demand sees a rapid fall and revenues take a hit amid the fast-evolving coronavirus outbreak. The airline 
is witnessing a significant increase in cancellations, with net bookings for travel being negative over the next four 
weeks. 
In fact, the carrier is seeing more ticket cancellations than bookings over the next month.Per the company's CEO 
Ed Bastian, 'the speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we've seen - and we've seen a lot in our business. 
We are moving quickly to preserve cash and protect our company. And with revenues dropping, we must be 
focused on taking costs out of our business.'With government travel restrictions, Delta will not be flying to 
continental Europe for the next 30 days. This halt could further be extended if needed. However, the airline will 
continue service to London. With significant reduction in capacity, the carrier will be grounding up to 300 aircraft. In 
response to the lower capacity, the company is also delaying new aircraft deliveries, which in turn would help in 
preserving cash. To further cut costs, Delta plans to reduce capital expenditures by a minimum of $2 billion this 
year. The carrier has also started offering voluntary short-term unpaid leaves, apart from freezing hiring. The 
Atlanta-GA based airline has also substantially reduced the use of consultants and contractors.Bastian expects the 
downturn to get worse in the future. Keeping in mind this deep crisis, he is foregoing his salary for the next six 
months.Due to the coronavirus-led demand slowdown, shares of Delta have declined 23.2% since the beginning of 
February.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDelta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the

Mar 14, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Views of empty 
streets, shuttered shops and a heavy silence greeted Italians from their windows on Saturday morning as the 
country spends its first weekend under lockdown in a bid to contain its coronavirus outbreak.Since Monday the 
country, which has recorded 17,660 infections and 1,266 deaths from the virus, has enacted a set of sweeping 
measures which have left millions virtually confined to their homes and shut down large parts of the 
economy.However, late on Friday Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte insisted that "Italy is not stopping" after a meeting 
with unions and businesses where security procedures were agreed to protect those Italians still going to work. A 
municipal policeman checks people are keeping their distance at the fruit and vegetable market in piazza San 
Cosimato, in the Rome district district of Trastevere Photo: AFP / Andreas SOLARO Italian media report that the 
government is expected this weekend to announce details of further measures to soften the shock to the economy, 
including moratoriums on loan payments, extending tax deadlines and making sure self-isolation is covered under

visitors remain a metre apart, as physical exercise is one of reasons for movement deemed "essential" under the

The only good thing about coronavirus is that at least people have stopped telling you where they went on holiday. 
It's not much of a silver lining but we must all draw what consolation we can in these panicked times.
Where once the weeks after half-term were filled with stories of skiing, mini-breaks to Venice, the beaches of 
Tenerife and even exotic jaunts to Asia, suddenly everyone has got terribly coy about their travels. Facebook pages 
are notably less full of holiday snaps. One old friend travelled to Vietnam seemingly unaware that each new photo 
screamed "self-isolation" on his return. Absolutely no one seems keen to mention their trip to Italy lest their children 
are plucked from school. Thus far, our own mini-break has triggered no alarms but, if anyone asks, we opted for a 
staycation.
(At this point, it is only fair to warn you that this column will be displaying signs of flippancy. There may also be 
isolated outbreaks of irreverence, so anyone who thinks that is inappropriate should probably move on.
You might also want to wash your hands for 20 seconds.) Then again, the upsurge of virus conversations has 
already left me mourning our old arguments over Brexit. In a choice between the WTO and the WHO I'll take the 
rules-of-origin debate any day. Coronavirus may be moving from the containment to delay stage but the 
conversations have already reached pandemic level. It is one thing to fret about death rates and vulnerable 
relatives, to search for accurate information, as opposed to those websites that appear to be edited by Dad's Army's 
Private Frazer. But information exchanges about bog roll? Not so much.
Why coronavirus is making me miss Brexit ROBERT SHRIMSLEY THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION
We are, at least, past the stage of conversation in which all discussions are dominated by the one person who 
insists the whole thing has been blown out of all proportion, that the world has gone mad and that this is the ideal 
moment to take advantage of Ryanair's very cheap flights to Wuhan. What we are not beyond, apparently, is the 
second-guessing of experts by people who, in fact, know nothing. It may well be that the chief medical officer will 
get some judgments wrong but I'm still going to go with his advice rather than that guy four doors down who has 
just read an article by Piers Morgan.
After medical concerns, the big debate is on stockpiling, though, of course, only those with a decent disposable 
income can afford to do this. Those of us fortunate enough to still have supplies in our Brexit panic room have, of 
course, a head start on others but we cannot afford to be complacent. We had to book our Ocado delivery four days 
earlier than usual and, even then, they were out of Imperial Leather.
But even in the face of panic buying, people are still maintaining some standards. A colleague reported that his 
local Tesco had sold out of all pasta except lasagne sheets. Seriously, what kind of panic is this? I mean, come on, 
I know it's a bit harder to cook but I wouldn't have thought a choice of starvation or lasagne was an especially 
difficult call.
I do worry, however, about these emergency food parcels we are going to get to people who are self-isolating. 
Obviously, survival is the first concern but Parmigiano-Reggiano is a close second. What if they give us goat's 
cheese instead? Many of us are not partial to it.
Health secretary Matt Hancock may be attempting to reassure us that no one will be left without food but, frankly, 
we want a little better than that.
This is not just a safety-of-life issue; it is a quality-of-life issue too. Bad enough to have a humanityand economy-
threatening pandemic; how much worse to have to get through it on tinned tuna. Forget your toilet paper and Carex, 
we are heading for the halloumi and we'll empty the shelves if we have to. Meanwhile, over in Barnes, I hear talk of 
residents from the Richmond Resistance, lying in wait to ambush emergency ricotta deliveries.
Apparently, this is all going to herald the return of the great British stiff upper lip. Perhaps we could shove the 
uncooked lasagne in our mouths for underpinning? robert.shrimsley@ft.com @robertshrimsley ILLUSTRATION BY

Italy starts first weekend under shutdown

Mar 14, 2020( Digital Journal: http://www.digitaljournal.com Delivered by Newstex)  Views of empty streets, 
shuttered shops and a heavy silence greeted Italians from their windows on Saturday morning as the country 
spends its first weekend under lockdown in a bid to contain its coronavirus outbreak.Since Monday the country, 
which has recorded 17,660 infections and 1,266 deaths from the virus, has enacted a set of sweeping measures 
which have left millions virtually confined to their homes and shut down large parts of the economy.However, late 
on Friday Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte insisted that "Italy is not stopping" after a meeting with unions and 
businesses where security procedures were agreed to protect those Italians still going to work.Italian media report 
that the government is expected this weekend to announce details of further measures to soften the shock to the 
economy, including moratoriums on loan payments, extending tax deadlines and making sure self-isolation is 
covered under sick leave. The spate of measures curbing almost every aspect of daily life has nonetheless 
continued.The latest came when city authorities in Milan and Rome decided as of Saturday to shut enclosed parks 
and gardens to prevent people gathering at close quarters. 
However, larger open spaces such as Rome's 80-hectare Villa Borghese will remain open as long as visitors 
remain a metre apart, as physical exercise is one of reasons for movement deemed "essential" under the new 
rules. Rome's historic centre was once again almost completely deserted on Saturday, with empty buses among 
the few vehicles on the roads.On Friday evening the normally bustling Trastevere quarter had the air of a ghost 
town, with only the odd dog walker on the streets and snatches of conversation from residents' windows breaking 
the silence.The last service from Rome's Ciampino airport -- a Ryanair flight to Nuremberg -- left on Friday night 
before the facility shut to passenger traffic until further notice.The capital's bigger Fiumicino airport is still running 
but its Terminal 1 will be closed on Tuesday.- 'Solidarity and prayer' -Meanwhile, according to Italy's civil protection 
department, the outbreak is showing signs of easing in the eleven towns in the north which were the first to be put 
under quarantine last month.But authorities are worried that a new wave of cases could follow the events of the last 
weekend, when crowds of visitors descended on beaches and ski resorts in the north despite the isolation 
measures.In the latest of several such cases, police in Rome said on Saturday morning that they had seized a 
batch of home-made face masks which contravened product standards. A further 700 masks for sale at inflated 
prices were also confiscated.But the crisis is also bringing out examples of social solidarity, with many Italians 
taking to their balconies on Friday night to sing in unison and raise morale.Italians are being encouraged to repeat 
the initiative on Saturday evening and at midday some could be seen responding to another call on social media to 
applaud at their windows in appreciation of health workers fighting the disease. For its part, the Basilica of Santa 
Italy starts first weekend under shutdown
Maria in Trastevere will be ringing its bells at 8pm, along with all the other churches in the quarter, "in an expression 
of affinity, solidarity and prayer" with all those affected by the virus.

Italy starts first weekend under shutdown
Italy starts first weekend under shutdown

Mar 14, 2020( Medical Xpress: http://medicalxpress.com Delivered by Newstex)  Views of empty streets, shuttered 
shops and a heavy silence greeted Italians from their windows on Saturday morning as the country spends its first 
weekend under lockdown in a bid to contain its coronavirus outbreak. Since Monday the country, which has 
recorded 17,660 infections and 1,266 deaths from the virus, has enacted a set of sweeping measures which have 
left millions virtually confined to their homes and shut down large parts of the economy. However, late on Friday 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte insisted that "Italy is not stopping" after a meeting with unions and businesses 
where security procedures were agreed to protect those Italians still going to work. 
Italian media report that the government is expected this weekend to announce details of further measures to soften 
the shock to the economy, including moratoriums on loan payments, extending tax deadlines and making sure self-
isolation is covered under sick leave[1].  The spate of measures curbing almost every aspect of daily life has 
nonetheless continued. The latest came when city authorities in Milan and Rome decided as of Saturday to shut 
enclosed parks and gardens to prevent people gathering at close quarters.  However, larger open spaces such as 
Rome's 80-hectare Villa Borghese will remain open as long as visitors remain a metre apart, as physical exercise[2] 
is one of reasons for movement deemed "essential" under the new rules. Rome's historic centre was once again 
almost completely deserted on Saturday, with empty buses among the few vehicles on the roads. On Friday 
evening the normally bustling Trastevere quarter had the air of a ghost town, with only the odd dog walker on the 
streets and snatches of conversation from residents' windows breaking the silence. The last service from Rome's 
Ciampino airport—a Ryanair flight to Nuremberg—left on Friday night before the facility shut to passenger traffic[3] 
until further notice. The capital's bigger Fiumicino airport is still running but its Terminal 1 will be closed on Tuesday. 
'Solidarity and prayer' Meanwhile, according to Italy's civil protection department, the outbreak is showing signs of 
easing in the eleven towns in the north which were the first to be put under quarantine last month. But authorities 
are worried that a new wave of cases could follow the events of the last weekend, when crowds of visitors 
descended on beaches and ski resorts in the north despite the isolation measures. In the latest of several such 
cases, police in Rome said on Saturday morning that they had seized a batch of home-made face masks which 
contravened product standards. A further 700 masks for sale at inflated prices were also confiscated. But the crisis 
is also bringing out examples of social solidarity, with many Italians taking to their balconies on Friday night to sing 
in unison and raise morale. Italians are being encouraged to repeat the initiative on Saturday evening and at 
midday some could be seen responding to another call on social media to applaud at their windows in appreciation 
of health workers fighting the disease.  For its part, the Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere will be ringing its bells 
at 8pm, along with all the other churches in the quarter, "in an expression of affinity, solidarity and prayer" with all

 Fitch Ratings on Thursday said COVID-19's dampening effect on travel sentiment is "placing downward pressure 
on global airline credit profiles."
Within EMEA, Dubaid-based Vista Global is the most vulnerable to a negative rating action, while Russia's Aeroflot 
has limited headroom in credit metrics, Fitch said. 
Meanwhile, budget airlines Ryanair (RYA.L) and Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) both have a fairly large exposure to Italy and 
other European countries, which has them more susceptible to the effects of the pandemic, but "strong balance 
sheets and solid liquidity partially mitigate risk," according to the note. 
Despite the downbeat outlook, Fitch said widespread bankruptcies are not expected, adding that relief is expected 
in 2021.

Litany of problems at Norwegian puts safe landing in doubt INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE

N orwegian Air Shuttle has stumbled from crisis to crisis in recent years. But the coronavirusinspired slump in 
demand is the most serious test yet for Europe's third-largest low-cost airline. The collapse in passenger numbers 
is putting all airlines in a tight spot, pushing them to cancel flights and seek ways of cutting costs fast as revenues 
evaporate. Norwegian is especially exposed due to its high debt burden incurred through a decade of rapid 
expansion.
Analysts are worried it could breach its bond covenants or simply run out of cash. Last year, it overcame similar 
Doomsday concerns to survive through a mixture of rights issues and other radical actions. Can it pull off the same 
trick again? At first, the litany of problems Norwegian has faced in the past two years appear to be down to bad 
luck. The airline had big problems with the engines on its Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft in 2018. A few months 
later, it was further hurt when the same manufacturer's 737 Max planes were grounded after two fatal crashes. Now 
the coronavirus has hit, sending Norwegian's shares down by almost three-quarters in the past month alone to their 
lowest level since 2005.
Norwegian's real problem is a lack of cash reserves if something goes wrong But some analysts argue that for all 
Norwegian's inability to catch a break, its real problem is its lack of cash reserves if something goes wrong. The 
airline sector is an industry where unexpected things are prone to occur; that leaves what Andrew Lobbenberg at 
HSBC calls the "world's most levered listed airline" susceptible to shocks.
Litany of problems at Norwegian puts safe landing in doubt INSIDE BUSINESS EUROPE
Norwegian's net debt has increased from NKr22bn ($2.3bn) in 2017 to NKr58bn at the end of last year - in large 
part due to accounting rule changes on leases - just as its equity market capitalisation has plunged to NKr1.8bn. 
Analysts at ABG Sundal Collier show its net debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation) ratio is 7.1, compared with an average of 1.8 for European carriers - and just 0.5 for low-cost airlines 
such as Ryanair and easyJet.
Norwegian, like nearly all carriers, is taking action. On Tuesday, it announced 3,000 flight cancellations - or about 
15 per cent of its capacity between mid-March and mid-June - and warned staff in a note "to be prepared for a 
scenario where we reduce capacity by up to 50 per cent".
Few in the industry - executives, analysts or investors - know how big the knock will be. Analysts at ABG already 
worried last week that Norwegian could break the book equity covenant on its bonds in the second quarter of this 
year. They also forecast that its net cash of NKr3bn - compared with revenues of NKr43.5bn last year - could shrink 
to just NKr880m by the end of June.
Few in the industry know how big the knock will be Mr Lobbenberg said on his models of falls in unit revenues this 
year of 3-7 per cent, "Norwegian lives" in each scenario. But, he added: "If it's materially larger, you do challenge 
those covenants."
Thus many speculate that Norwegian will need to tap shareholders for the fourth time since March 2018. ABG 
analysts estimated Norwegian could have to raise up to NKr3bn, close to double its current market value, to avoid 
facing the same worries next year. But raising capital during such a crisis is far from straightforward. "It's possible 
that launching a rights issue in the current environment wouldn't work," said Mr Lobbenberg.
The market is looking closely at what Geir Karlsen, Norwegian's chief financial officer, can do after he positively 
surprised investors last year. He shifted the strategy from growth to profitability, and unveiled a package of 
measures to shore up the balance sheet. Debt was restructured, a long-awaited aircraft joint venture unveiled, and 
a stake in the bank the airline founded sold off.
Then late last year Norwegian's board upset many in the market by passing over Mr Karlsen for the chief executive 
job, instead choosing a former retail executive and McKinsey consultant, Jacob Schram.
As the coronavirus deepens in Europe, the flight path for Messrs Schram and Karlsen to guide Norwegian to safety 
is getting more and more turbulent.
