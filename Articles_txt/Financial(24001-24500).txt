Irish , Scottish airports reopen as ash heads west

All airports in Scotland and Ireland reopened Thursday after the latest engine-wrecking ash cloud from Iceland's 
volcano drifted west back into the Atlantic.
But Eurocontrol, the continent's air traffic management agency, said it was considering rerouting flights between 
Europe and North America to avoid ash buildup over the North Atlantic.
The latest threat from Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul volcano caused two days of runway shutdowns and flight 
cancellations in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland, inconveniencing an estimated 100,000 
travelers. Irish and British airlines launched extra services Thursday to help get them on their way.
The volcano has regularly belched out ash since its eruption began April 13, and European air authorities initially 
reacted April 14-20 by shutting down all air services in several countries to the east, stopping 100,000 flights and 10 
million passengers.
This time, newly negotiated European safety rules restricted the aircraft grounding to Britain and Ireland and 
involved more precise closure orders based on how close the densest ash clouds were to airports' landing and 
takeoff paths.
Until Eyjafjallajokul stops its emissions, the key to the future course of Europe's ash crisis will be the prevailing 
winds that have been pushing the ash clouds into European air space at altitudes of 10,000 to 20,000 feet (3 to 6 
kilometers).
When the Atlantic winds blow to the northeast toward the unpopulated Arctic the typical pattern in springtime the 
danger to aircraft is minimized. But when they shift southward, as happened this week and in mid-April, airlines' 
ability to land and depart safely is jeopardized.
Eurocontrol, an intergovernmental agency in Brussels, sets the air routes that airliners can use in and around 
Europe on a daily basis.
Irish , Scottish airports reopen as ash heads west
On Thursday it forecast that ash concentrations to the west and northwest of Ireland could pose a risk by Friday to 
trans-Atlantic aircraft, because for the first time since the threat emerged last month the ash formations were 
expected to reach 35,000 feet (10.5 kilometers), roughly the cruising altitude of long-haul aircraft.
But the Irish Aviation Authority emphasized that all trans-Atlantic flights could easily reroute north or south of the 
new obstacle.
Ireland's major airlines resumed normal schedules Thursday, although Aer Lingus did cancel 34 flights and Ryanair 
four, chiefly involving airports in southwest Ireland where the ash was last to leave. Scotland's airports reopened 
earlier.
British and Irish aviation authorities maintained a cautious note because of the uncertainty of the winds. Forecasters 
said they expected the winds to shift to the northeast again Thursday and stay that way through the weekend 
before they turn south again next week, putting the security of airports' landing and takeoff paths in doubt again.
The volcano, about 900 miles (1,500 miles) northwest of Ireland, has shown no signs of stopping since it began 
belching ash April 13. The glacier-capped volcano last erupted sporadically from 1821 to 1823.

British and Irish authorities are hopeful of re-establishing normal air traffic Thursday following two days of 
shutdowns caused by a new wave of dense volcanic ash from Iceland.
The ash clouds snarled air traffic Wednesday in Ireland and Scotland, stranding tens of thousands of people, but 
narrowly missing England and key London air hubs.
Dublin Airport canceled all flights until 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) Thursday (11 p.m. EDT Wednesday), marooning more 
than 30,000 passengers in the process.
More than a dozen other airports throughout the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland shut down, too, 
as unseasonable winds pushed the engine-wrecking ash southwest back toward the Atlantic. Britain's National Air 
Traffic Service said the densest ash clouds skirted the western coast of England and North Wales but posed no 
threat to airports there.
The renewed volcanic-ash threat in the skies of Britain and Ireland this week, following a two-week lull, has tested 
the more precise safety rules adopted by European aviation authorities following the unprecedented April 14-20 
closure of most northern European airspace.
This time authorities are grounding flights only when the ash reaches sufficient density levels and gets within 60 
miles (100 kilometers) of an airport's path for landings and takeoffs a stark contrast to last month's closures of air 
services throughout several countries.
Britain's National Air Traffic Service cleared Edinburgh Airport in eastern Scotland to reopen Wednesday evening, 
but Glasgow Airport further west was required to shut its runways until 1 a.m. (0000GMT) Thursday at the earliest.
The Irish Aviation Authority said Dublin should be the country's first airport to reopen. The other major international 
hub, Shannon Airport, will shut from 5:30 p.m. (1630GMT) Wednesday until 1 p.m. (1200GMT) Thursday. Two 
smaller airports in southwest Ireland, Cork and Kerry, were to shut at midnight and reopen at 11 a.m. (1000GMT) 
and 3 p.m. (1400GMT), respectively.
UK, Irish hopeful volcanic ash clouds dissipating
The rapidly changing situation obliged would-be fliers to hop on trains, buses and taxis to reach nearby airports. 
Virgin Trains also launched extra services Wednesday between Scotland and London.
Market-leading airline Ryanair sought to discourage the passengers' dashing from airport to airport by announcing 
blanket closures Wednesday for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Dublin.
Ryanair also warned customers planning to fly out of several airports in the west and north of England Bristol, 
Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle to check the company's Web site and remain alert for possible 
closure announcements.
But Scotland's leader, First Minister Alex Salmond, slammed the Civil Aviation Authority for issuing a vague, 
inaccurate statement overnight that resulted in unnecessary flight cancelations in eastern Scotland, including 
Edinburgh and Aberdeen.
"That can't be allowed to happen again. ... Press statements must be clear and not cause confusion," Salmond 
said.
The CAA confirmed its announcement which flatly said Scotland's airports would close first thing Wednesday 
should not have included east-coast airports, which didn't have to shut as quickly as Glasgow to the west.
Donie Mooney, operations director at the Irish Aviation Authority, said the volcano's emissions changed over the 
past few days and caught forecasters off guard, forcing Ireland to abandon its hopes of staying open Wednesday.
"The ash plume has been going higher and the ash is of a coarser nature. That threw our projected opening times 
into some disarray," he said.
Still, the ash clouds are remaining below 20,000 feet (6 kilometers), far lower than the cruising altitude of passenger 
jets. Therefore, they pose a danger only to ascending or descending aircraft.
In Iceland, civil protection official Agust Gunnar Gylfason said the Eyjafjallajokul volcano was spewing out ash 
continuously, but only at a rate equivalent to 5 percent of its original volumes in the early days of the eruption.
"It's relatively little," he said.
Nonetheless the volcano, about 900 miles (1,500 miles) northwest of Ireland, has shown no signs of stopping since 
it began belching ash April 13. The glacier-capped volcano last erupted sporadically from 1821 to 1823.
Travel experts warned that Ireland was particularly vulnerable to summertime disruption if Eyjafjallajokul doesn't 
calm down.
"If Iceland has the wrong kind of geology, Ireland has the wrong kind of geography. It's too close to Iceland and is 
dependent on air travel," said tourism industry analyst Simon Calder.
Last month, European authorities canceled 100,000 flights affecting 10 million passengers as they sought to craft a 
plan for managing the ash menace. The groundings cost the aviation industry billions in lost business. EU rules also 
require the airlines to cover the hotel and food expenses of stranded passengers who stay put to wait out the 
delays.

A new wave of dense volcanic ash from Iceland snarled air traffic Wednesday in Ireland and Scotland, stranding 
tens of thousands of people but narrowly missing England and key London air hubs.
Dublin Airport canceled all flights until 4 a.m. (0300GMT) Thursday, marooning more than 30,000 passengers in the 
process.
More than a dozen other airports throughout the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland shut down, too, 
as unseasonable winds pushed the engine-wrecking ash southwest back toward the Atlantic. Britain's National Air 
Traffic Service said the densest ash clouds skirted the western coast of England and North Wales but posed no 
threat to airports there.
The renewed volcanic-ash threat in the skies of Britain and Ireland this week, following a two-week lull, has tested 
the more precise safety rules adopted by European aviation authorities following the unprecedented April 14-20 
closure of most northern European airspace.
This time authorities are grounding flights only when the ash reaches sufficient density levels and gets within 60 
miles (100 kilometers) of an airport's path for landings and takeoffs a stark contrast to last month's closures of air 
services throughout several countries.
Britain's National Air Traffic Service cleared Edinburgh Airport in eastern Scotland to reopen Wednesday evening, 
but Glasgow Airport further west was required to shut its runways until 1 a.m. (0000GMT) Thursday at the earliest.
The Irish Aviation Authority said Dublin should be the country's first airport to reopen. The other major international 
hub, Shannon Airport, will shut from 5:30 p.m. (1630GMT) Wednesday until 1 p.m. (1200GMT) Thursday. Two 
smaller airports in southwest Ireland, Cork and Kerry, were to shut at midnight and reopen at 11 a.m. (1000GMT) 
and 3 p.m. (1400GMT), respectively.
The rapidly changing situation obliged would-be fliers to hop on trains, buses and taxis to reach nearby airports. 
Virgin Trains also launched extra services Wednesday between Scotland and London.
Volcanic ash snarls Scottish, Irish air services
Market-leading airline Ryanair sought to discourage the passengers' dashing from airport to airport by announcing 
blanket closures Wednesday for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Dublin.
Ryanair also warned customers planning to fly out of several airports in the west and north of England Bristol, 
Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle to check the company's Web site and remain alert for possible 
closure announcements.
But Scotland's leader, First Minister Alex Salmond, slammed the Civil Aviation Authority for issuing a vague, 
inaccurate statement overnight that resulted in unnecessary flight cancelations in eastern Scotland, including 
Edinburgh and Aberdeen.
"That can't be allowed to happen again. ... Press statements must be clear and not cause confusion," Salmond 
said.
The CAA confirmed its announcement which flatly said Scotland's airports would close first thing Wednesday 
should not have included east-coast airports, which didn't have to shut as quickly as Glasgow to the west.
Donie Mooney, operations director at the Irish Aviation Authority, said the volcano's emissions changed over the 
past few days and caught forecasters off guard, forcing Ireland to abandon its hopes of staying open Wednesday.
"The ash plume has been going higher and the ash is of a coarser nature. That threw our projected opening times 
into some disarray," he said.
Still, the ash clouds are remaining below 20,000 feet (6 kilometers), far lower than the cruising altitude of passenger 
jets. Therefore they pose a danger only to ascending or descending aircraft.
In Iceland, civil protection official Agust Gunnar Gylfason said the Eyjafjallajokul volcano was spewing out ash 
continuously, but only at a rate equivalent to 5 percent of its original volumes in the early days of the eruption.
"It's relatively little," he said.
Nonetheless the volcano, about 900 miles (1,500 miles) northwest of Ireland, has shown no signs of stopping since 
it began belching ash April 13. The glacier-capped volcano last erupted sporadically from 1821 to 1823.

Thousands of air passengers are being hit by disruption as many flights in and out of Ireland are again halted by 
new ash restrictions.
Intending travellers have been told to check with their airline's website on whether their flight will operate.
Rolling "restrictions" are being imposed by the Irish Aviation Authority on most airports from this morning on.
Donegal Airport will be restricted from 8am, Sligo from 9am, Dublin and Knock from 11am. Aer Lingus has already 
cancelled 26 flights out of Dublin and four out of Cork, and says it expects to cancel more through the day. The IAA 
says the restrictions will be "until further notice". Cork, Waterford and Kerry will not have restrictions imposed before 
2pm, though the IAA says restrictions after that are likely. No restrictions will apply to Shannon or Galway airports 
for the moment. Some airports in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland have been closed since 7 am. Glasgow, 
Prestwick and Derry are likely to be closed all day, while Belfast is likely to close in the afternoon. Cancellation of 
flights at airports in the Republic has already begun, with Aer Lingus having abandoned a series of early morning 
flights to the UK and the continent. The airline's website says it has cancelled 26 flights from Dublin so far and four 
from Cork. Ryanair flights are still flying, except to Scotland. The airline says it will provide an update at 9 am.

Thousands of air passengers are being hit by disruption as many flights in and out of Ireland are again halted by 
new ash restrictions.
Intending travellers have been told to check with their airline's website on whether their flight will operate.
Rolling "restrictions" are being imposed by the Irish Aviation Authority on most airports from this morning on.
Donegal Airport will be restricted from 8am, Sligo from 9am, Dublin and Knock from 11am. Aer Lingus has already 
cancelled 26 flights out of Dublin and four out of Cork, and says it expects to cancel more through the day. The IAA 
says the restrictions will be "until further notice". Cork, Waterford and Kerry will not have restrictions imposed before 
2pm, though the IAA says restrictions after that are likely. No restrictions will apply to Shannon or Galway airports 
for the moment. Some airports in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland have been closed since 7 am. Glasgow, 
Prestwick and Derry are likely to be closed all day, while Belfast is likely to close in the afternoon. Cancellation of 
flights at airports in the Republic has already begun, with Aer Lingus having abandoned a series of early morning 
flights to the UK and the continent. The airline's website says it has cancelled 26 flights from Dublin so far and four 
from Cork. Ryanair flights are still flying, except to Scotland. The airline says it will provide an update at 9 am.

300 Europe Flights Being Cut As Volcanic Ash Partly Closes British Airspace
300 Europe Flights Being Cut As Volcanic Ash Partly Closes British 
Airspace

(RTTNews) - The drifting ash from the Icelandic volcano eruption has created a new no-fly zone over Britain and 
affected more air passengers for the second consecutive day.
Return of the hazardous ash forced airports in parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland to 
close again after a brief re-opening Tuesday.
Reports said airports and flights in the northwest of England and North Wales could also be hit during the afternoon 
if the ash continues to move south.
Around 300 of a scheduled 29,000 flights were being canceled in Europe Wednesday due to the air traffic 
restriction, the European air traffic agency Eurocontrol said.
"The situation is not expected to improve in this area during the day," the body coordinating air traffic control across 
the continent said in a statement.
"The whole of Ireland, west Scotland and north-west England could be affected, with risk to operations at 
Manchester and Liverpool airports," it said.
All flights in and out of Ireland&apos;s main Dublin airport were halted from 11 a.m. local time Wednesday after 
signs of an increase of volcanic ash levels in the skies.
Glasgow Airport, Scotland&apos;s busiest international airport, will be closed for 12 hours on Wednesday. 
Restrictions are also likely to be imposed on Cork, Waterford and Kerry at 2 p.m.
The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) said it was taking the measure to avoid risk of ash ingestion in aircraft engines. 
There were no restrictions on Shannon airport in the west of the country.
Reports quoting the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said Glasgow, Prestwick and Derry are likely to be closed all day, 
Inverness shut in the morning only, and Belfast and Edinburgh in the afternoon.
Edinburgh was one of two in Scotland which had been cleared to remain open.
British Airways said it was canceling all flights to and from the Scottish cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.
300 Europe Flights Being Cut As Volcanic Ash Partly Closes British Airspace
All easyJet flights to and from Belfast City, Belfast International, Glasgow and Inverness airports up to 1 p.m. were 
canceled, the airline said.
Irish budget airline Ryanair said because of the closure of airspace, all flights in and out of Belfast, Derry, Edinburgh 
and Glasgow Prestwick have been canceled until at least 2 p.m.
It said all flights hit by the restrictions at Irish airports have been canceled.
Airports in Aberdeen, Carlisle, Blackpool, Liverpool and Manchester were open. Flights were operating as normal in 
the rest of Britain, reports said.
Air passengers have been advised to check with airports before traveling, as the situation in the skies has been 
changing hour by hour, adding to the uncertainty.
The risk of closures in much of Britain was likely to recede during the day, BBC reported, quoting CAA chief 
executive Andrew Haines.
Earlier forecasts suggested higher ash levels were drifting southwards, but the CAA says "the weather fronts 
overnight suggest the wind pattern will be more due northerly."
A CAA spokeswoman said: "Met Office forecasts show that levels of ash in the atmosphere over Scotland and 
Northern Ireland will exceed the concentrations that engine manufactures have agreed are safe for operations."
Tuesday afternoon, when the ash drifted off, airspace over Ireland was re-opened after a six-hour shutdown.
Elsewhere in Europe, Greek airports closed for all arriving, departing and domestic traffic as a result of the 48-hour 
industrial action protesting the government&apos;s austerity measures. Eurocontrol said an estimated 900 flights 
were canceled in Greek airspace.
The latest disruption, which could signal that travel glitches will continue into the summer holiday period, was 
caused by ash being blown from the same volcano in Iceland that caused mayhem for 10 million air passengers last 
month.
The eruption of a volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull Glacier in Iceland on April 14 forced the shutdown of airspace 
across Europe for six days, leaving thousands of travelers stranded. The airspace was reopened only after 
emergency negotiations between European governments, airlines and regulators.
European Transport Ministers agreed on Tuesday to set safety limits for flying through the ash, which can paralyze 
jet engines, and to unify European airspace.
Airborne volcanic ash threatens aviation safety because the abrasive, silica-based materials may clog engines and 
scar windscreens. Speed sensors, which are critical in flight, may also be disabled by flying through ash clouds.
Last month&apos;s airspace closures cost Europe&apos;s airlines at least 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion), the 
European Commission has estimated.

CRH shares led the Irish stock market lower this morning as it reported a big drop in sales for the year so far.
Shares in the building materials giant have dropped by 63c to 1940 after an interim management statement from it 
this morning that revealed a 14pc drop in revenues for the year to April, largely due to severe winter weather.
It put additional downward pressure on the ISEQ index, which has been reeling since yesterday on fears of

From Mr Michael Dowden.
Sir, Your report ("Flight costs soar", May 3) that "a June midweek flight from Gatwick to Malaga with EasyJet was 
138 per cent cheaper than a ticket for the following Saturday".
I doubt if Ryanair could beat that one. Was the extra 38 per cent in cash or vouchers?

'Summer of uncertainty' looms for Europe aviation

Iceland's volcanic ash threatened European air space once again Tuesday, forcing Ireland and some North Atlantic 
islands to temporarily shut down airports for the first time in 12 days.
Eamonn Brennan, chief of the Irish Aviation Authority, warned of "a summer of uncertainty" in the air due to the 
continuing eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokul (ay-yah-FYAH-lah-yer-kuhl) volcano.
In Brussels, European Union transport ministers held another emergency aviation meeting and emerged vowing 
that reforming the continent's patchwork air traffic control system into a one seamless airspace was a "top priority." 
Germany and France also demanded binding rules to determine when airspaces should be closed and planes 
grounded because of volcanic ash.
Airlines and airports complained bitterly that EU uncertainty during last month's volcanic crisis grounded too many 
flights for too long last month. In all, more than 100,000 flights were canceled, inconveniencing 10 million travelers.
Aviation authorities shut down airports throughout Ireland, Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands and the Faeroe 
Islands for several hours Tuesday after unexpectedly strong and unseasonal winds drove a thick cloud of ash 
southward from Iceland.
Irish air space reopened at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT, 8 a.m. EDT) and services were scheduled to return to normal as the 
ash drifted south into the open Atlantic at too low an altitude to pose a risk to aircraft.
Britain's National Air Traffic Service said there was no immediate threat of disruption to British airports but said the 
situation remained "dynamic." Ireland said there might be new shutdowns Wednesday.
Hanging over all official statements were fears that the volcano in southeast Iceland could keep scattering ash and 
travel chaos across Europe all summer.
"We remain at risk (of further shutdowns), particularly towards Wednesday," Brennan said in a telephone interview. 
"We're probably facing a summer of uncertainty because of this ash cloud."
'Summer of uncertainty' looms for Europe aviation
Brennan said Ireland had no choice but to shut its air space at 7 a.m. (0600GMT) Tuesday because a thick cloud of 
ash was reaching the island. The ash generally poses a risk only to aircraft at lower altitudes, when they are 
ascending to cruising altitude or coming in to land.
Brennan said prevailing winds normally would push the ash northward to the Arctic, but turned southward this week, 
sending ash straight over the Faeroes, down past the Hebrides on Scotland's northwest coast and over Ireland, 
which lies 900 miles (1,500 kilometers) southeast of Iceland.
Ireland's temporary shutdown grounded more than 200 flights, most of them operated by airlines Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus. Both airlines scheduled extra flights in the afternoon and evening to clear the backlog of stranded 
customers.
Iceland's Institute of Earth Sciences said the volcano's plume has risen this week to nearly 5.5 kilometers (18,000 
feet) following several large explosions. It said tremors emanating from the volcano have intensified since Sunday 
night and the eruption that began April 14 shows no signs of ending.
The last time this volcano erupted in 1821 the eruption lasted for over a year.
Among the tens of thousands of temporarily inconvenienced passengers was David Cameron, leader of Britain's 
opposition Conservative Party. He was scheduled to address rallies in Northern Ireland in advance of Thursday's 
British election and became one of the first to fly into the British province once air restrictions were lifted.

Iceland's volcanic ash renewed its threat to European air space on Tuesday, forcing Ireland to shut services 
temporarily for the first time in 12 days and reminding European leaders they still must improve their aviation 
coordination system.
Aviation authorities shut down airports throughout Ireland, Scotland's Outer Hebrides islands and the Faeroe 
Islands for several hours Tuesday after unexpectedly strong and unseasonal winds drove a thick cloud of ash 
southward the night before.
Irish air space reopened at 1 p.m. (1200GMT) and services were scheduled to return to normal as the ash kept 
moving south into the open Atlantic at too low an altitude to pose a risk to aircraft.
Britain's National Air Traffic Service said there was no immediate threat of disruption to British airports, although the 
situation remained "dynamic."
The shutdowns provided an alarming backdrop for European Union transport chiefs meeting in emergency session 
in Brussels.
They still are seeking stronger systems to manage the fallout from weeks of ash emissions from Eyjafjallajokul (ay-
yah-FYAH-lah-yer-kuhl) amid fears that the volcano in southeast Iceland could keep scattering ash across Europe 
all summer.
In Brussels, European Union transport ministers held an emergency meeting Tuesday to seek better coordination 
within the continent's patchwork of nationally controlled airspaces. Germany and France demanded binding EU-
wide policies on ash levels that would allow planes to fly and determine when airports should be closed down and 
reopened across the 27-nation bloc.
Airlines and airports complained bitterly that EU uncertainty during last month's crisis meant too many flights were 
grounded for too long last month. In all, more than 100,000 flights were canceled, inconveniencing 10 million 
travelers.

"We are battling through everything to make this happen," he said.

Ireland's airspace will reopen at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT) Tuesday because the threat from volcanic ash has faded 
overnight, but Irish air travelers face a "summer of uncertainty" because of the long-running Iceland eruption, the 
Irish Aviation Authority said.
The authority temporarily grounded services at all Irish airports at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) because shifting winds had 
pushed ash plumes from Iceland south into Irish airspace, pushing the risk of damage to jet engines beyond 
acceptable levels.
Eamonn Brennan, chief executive of the Irish Aviation Authority, said the prevailing winds would normally go 
northward but have switched south this week, sending ash over Ireland approximately 900 miles (1,500 kilometers) 
southwest of Iceland.
"We remain at risk (of further shutdowns), particularly towards Wednesday," Brennan said in a telephone interview. 
"We're probably facing a summer of uncertainty because of this ash cloud."
Tuesday's ash worries also forced aviation authorities in Northern Ireland, Scotland's outermost Hebrides islands, 
and the Danish territory of the Faeroe Islands to ground flights.
Northern Ireland said it would join the Republic of Ireland in reopening services Tuesday afternoon. But the situation 
remained unclear in the Hebrides and Faeroes, island systems much nearer Iceland in the North Atlantic.
Among the tens of thousands of would-be fliers inconvenienced was David Cameron, leader of Britain's opposition 
Conservative Party, who delayed plans to fly into Northern Ireland to seek support there before Thursday's British 
election. Cameron said later he still planned to make it to the British territory Tuesday.
Ireland became the first country outside Iceland to shut down its airspace since the April 14-22 crisis caused by 
billowing ash clouds from Iceland's erupting Eyjafjallajokull (pronounced ay-yah-FYAH-lah-yer-kuhl) volcano.
European Union authorities took a week during that crisis to draft new safety standards and more precise rules for 
governing whether aircraft could travel through ash-tainted air.
Irish airports reopen Tuesday as ash threat fades
In Brussels, European Union transport ministers gathered in emergency session Tuesday to seek better 
coordination within the continent's patchwork airspace to avoid airline chaos and commercial losses from Icelandic 
volcanoes or other surprise events.
Germany wants binding rules to define ash concentrations and when to keep airports closed. Airlines and airports 
complained bitterly that EU uncertainty meant too many flights more than 100,000 were grounded for too long last 
month.
Ireland's temporary shutdown Tuesday grounded more than 200 flights chiefly operated by airlines Ryanair and Aer 
Lingus.

Ryanair today welcomed a German court's ruling rejecting application for compensation made by several Ryanair 
travellers on a flight cancelled due to a technical fault.
The Irish no-frills airline welcomed the decision of the Lubeck District Court which found that a Ryanair flight which 
was delayed due to a technical fault in Lubeck in Sep 2007 was exceptional circumstances under EU261 
regulations.
The Court ruled that no compensation was due to passengers in these exceptional circumstances.
The passengers, who were seeking compensation of over E500 as a result "of this unavoidable safety related 
delay", had their claims dismissed by the Lubeck Court which found that unforeseen technical faults are beyond the 
airline's control and are therefore exceptional circumstance, Ryanair said. "This decision of Lubeck District Court 
reinforces the provisions of the EU261 which provides that no compensation is due to passengers in cases of 
exceptional circumstances such as technical faults that are beyond the airlines' control. We understand that 
delayed flights can be frustrating. However, we must always make decisions which prioritise the safety of our 
passengers, crew and aircraft. In this case a technical fault caused a delay to this flight and we had no alternative 
but to operate it later than originally scheduled. We welcome this decision by the Lubeck Court which confirms that 
compensation does not arise in cases where exceptional circumstances such as technical faults force airlines to put 
passenger safety ahead of passenger convenience," Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said.

Flights in and out of Ireland have been halted since 7 o'clock this morning because of a new volcanic ash scare.
Airspace over the country has been closed by a change of wind direction in the north Atlantic, which has blown ash 
cloud over Ireland once again.
The travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers have been disrupted, with airlines also facing substantial new 
financial losses.
The closure of airspace over the Republic was ordered by the Irish Aviation Authority, with British authorities also 
closing the airspace over Northern Ireland. The IAA is to issue a statement at 9 am to review the situation. Ryanair 
announced last night that it would cease flights to an from the island of Ireland from 6am - 2pm. Aer Lingus has said 
that all flights on routes to and from the UK and the continent up to 1pm have been cancelled. It says, however, that 
its transatlantic services are still scheduled to operate, except for flight EI 105 from Dublin to New York. Over-flights 
of Ireland are not impacted, the IAA added, since the closure of airspace is only up to 20,000 ft height. Speaking 
last night, Eamon Brennan, IAA chief executive, said : "The latest information we have is that some of the denser 
volcanic ash, that's the no-fly zone, is over the Donegal area and we are concerned about the north-easterly winds 
moving this down over the rest of the country,' he told RTE radio. 'At the moment we have a slither of denser ash 
over the midlands and if this continues for the next number of hours we have no option, based on the new regime 
imposed in Europe last week, except to impose a no-fly zone." All passengers are advised to check with their 
airline's websites this morning before going to airports.

The main Dublin shares index suffered another bout of selling after last week's major rebound as jitters returned to 
the markets on the growing Greek debt crisis.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 42.69 points to 3,354.31.
At the weekend European finance ministers agreed a 110 billion euro bailout package for Greece, but analysts said 
doubts remained about whether the country could make the steep budget cuts necessary, with unions planning 
more strikes. Europe's stock markets fell sharply while the euro matched the one-year low against the dollar hit last 
week on concerns about Greek debt problems and fears of possible contagion to other vulnerable euro zone 
countries.
Banks led the fall with Irish Life and Permanent losing 16c to E2.89 while AIB dropped by 1c to E1.42 and Bank of 
Ireland fell 4c to E1.64. Shares in CRH fell by 33c to E21.10 after Vulcan Materials, the largest producer of 
aggregates in the US, reported a first quarter loss per share from continuing operations of 35c, slightly ahead of the 
consensus estimate of 36.8c. Aggregates shipments declined 14pc in the quarter due to weak demand in private 
construction and adverse weather in key markets. Aggregates prices rose 1pc but varied greatly by region with 
some areas reporting price improvements well above the company average and others seeing declines. The index's 
two aviation stocks fell sharply with Aer Lingus down 3c to E0.70 and Ryanair losing 4c to E3.69 as the volcanic 
ash cloud made an unwelcome reappearance. Aer Lingus says the group's financial performance for the next three 
months will be significantly impacted by recent airspace closures after the volcanic eruption in Iceland last month. In 
an interim management statement, which examines the airline's performance for the first three months of 2010, it 
said its initial estimate of the cost of the disruption is about E20m. 'However, the final cost will depend on the actual 
level of customer claims,' it cautions.

Highlight: Dense plume leads to no-fly zone
Body
Air passengers are facing the threat of further disruption after the volcanic ash cloud that wreaked havoc last month 
drifted southwards, leading the Republic of Ireland and parts of Scotland to restrict flights today.
The Irish Aviation Authority said it would impose a no-fly zone over Ireland between 7am and 1pm today as a dense 
plume of ash drifted across the island. More than 440 flights will be affected by the closure, which will be reviewed 
this morning. Nats, the UK national air traffic controller, said it would not disrupt aircraft flying over Ireland from 
Britain or Europe, or southern British airports including Heathrow - Europe's busiest air hub. "At this stage it will be 
business as usual at 7am tomorrow," Nats said.
The IAA said information from the Volcanic Ash Advice Centre suggested that the no-fly zone would affect Dublin, 
Shannon, Galway, Sligo, Ireland West, Donegal, Cork and Kerry.
"Ireland falls within the predicted area of ash concentrations that exceed acceptable engine manufacturer tolerance 
levels," the IAA said in a statement.
Irish airline Aer Lingus said it would cancel all scheduled services on its UK and European networks until 1pm. 
Ryanair and Easyjet said they expected some disruptions and cancellations.
The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said airspace over the Outer Hebrides was closed from 6pm yesterday, with flights 
to and from the Western Isles also facing disruption.
Airports in Northern Ireland said flights were expected to run as normal although some airlines suspended services.
Iceland's Meteorological Office said a change of wind direction over the past few days meant the ash cloud was 
blowing south and south-east towards Europe, rather than northward. But the ash cloud was much smaller than the 
one that paralysed airports last month.
In April, tens of thousands of Britons were stranded abroad and faced long delays when airspace was closed by the 
eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano.
Volcanic ash halts flights over Ireland and Scotland
The cancellations cost the industry an estimated £1.1bn, according to the European Union, which has proposed a 
series of measures to help the cash-strapped industry.
European airlines have been demanding government assistance to cope with lost revenue and the cost of feeding 
and lodging stranded passengers.
To bolster their case they have noted that flawed computer models used by member states were partly to blame for 
grounding aircraft even after it was safe to fly.
The rules governing volcanic ash have since been revised, allowing flights to continue through areas of low density 
provided its concentration is not considered likely to pose any risk to aircraft and passengers.
EU transport ministers are due to meet this week to discuss awarding state aid to airlines, which were already 
suffering from the effect of the recession on the industry.

Ireland shuts airports Tuesday as ash risk returns
Ireland shuts airports Tuesday as ash risk returns

Body
All flights in and out of Ireland have been canceled Tuesday morning because of the renewed risk of volcanic ash 
drifting south from Iceland, the Irish Aviation Authority announced Monday.
But experts said they couldn't tell whether the shifting winds would lead to wider European airspace shutdowns, 
mirroring last month's crisis, when more than 100,000 flights were canceled and airlines estimated they lost more 
than $2 billion in business.
"We cannot really tell what it is going to do," said University of Iceland geophysicist Pall Einarsson.
Ireland's airspace managers said all flights from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. (0600GMT to 1200GMT) had to be canceled 
because of "the safety risks to crews and passengers as a result of the drift south of the volcanic ash cloud caused 
by the northeasterly winds."
The airport shutdown affects both the Republic of Ireland and the British territory of Northern Ireland, leaving the 
island dependent temporarily on ferry links to Britain and France.
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority also announced a shutdown of air services over Scotland's outermost Hebrides 
islands Monday night because of the risk that ash could be ingested into aircrafts' jet engines. The shutdowns were 
the first in Britain and Ireland since April 22, a week after the Eyjafjallajokull (pronounced ay-yah-FYAH-lah-yer-
kuhl) volcano erupted in Iceland.
However the latest restrictions will not affect airplanes that normally use Irish or British airspace to reach other 
destinations, because the ash threat exists at much lower altitudes than the cruising altitudes for international 
flights.
The two major Irish-based airlines, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, announced more than 200 flight cancelations and said 
they doubted if any Irish services would resume before 2 p.m. (1300GMT). However Aer Lingus said all but one of 
its trans-Atlantic services to U.S. cities would operate later Tuesday, subject to delays.
Ireland shuts airports Tuesday as ash risk returns
Dubliners said they were already braced for potential shutdowns, and expressed relief that the disruption had not 
fallen on a special three-day weekend that ended Monday.
"Better Tuesday than Monday. We're all back to work Tuesday anyway," said Sheila Dawson, 27, a Dublin 
secretary who had just returned from long weekend in Spain. "Looks like I just made it although getting trapped in 
sunny Spain wouldn't have been so bad either."
Iceland's weather forecasting service attributed the resumed threat to Irish airspace to a change in wind direction, 
not substantially increased emissions of ash.
Icelandic meteorologist Ole Arneson said the Eyjafjallajokull volcano was emitting a slightly higher level of ash 
Monday than on previous days. He speculated this was because of an increased volume of melted ice, which 
generates the ash.
"There seems to be a little bit more ash, but the seismic activity is more or less unchanged," he said.
Last month the volcano unleashed massive plumes of ash that turned much of European airspace into a no-fly zone 
for a week.
European Union authorities working with jet engine manufacturers eventually established new, more precise 
measurements for determining whether aircraft could fly safely in ash-affected airspace, which should limit the 
spread of future shutdowns.

Ireland's Aviation Authority said Monday it was banning all flights in and out of Ireland on Tuesday morning because 
of a renewed risk of volcanic ash drifting south from Iceland.
All flights to and from Irish airports will be prohibited from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. local time Tuesday (0600GMT to 
1200GMT; 2 a.m to 8 a.m EDT), the authority said in a statement. The restrictions will not affect planes flying over 
Ireland from Britain and Europe.
"The decision is based on the safety risks to crews and passengers as a result of the drift south of the volcanic ash 
cloud caused by the northeasterly winds," the statement said.
Ireland is expected to experience ash concentrations that exceed acceptable engine manufacturer tolerance levels, 
the authority said.
The budget airline Ryanair said it had canceled all of its flights scheduled to operate to and from Ireland including 
Belfast and Londonderry, both in Northern Ireland between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. local time had been canceled.
The airline warned of further disruptions, as well, including in Scotland.
Iceland's Meteorological Office said the restrictions were caused by a change in wind direction in the past few days, 
not an increased amount of ash spewing from southern Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull (pronounced ay-yah-FYAH-lah-yer-
kuhl) volcano.
The eruption continued to be stable, the forecaster said.
The volcano unleashed a massive ash plume last month that turned much of European into a no-fly zone for days. 
More than 100,000 flights were canceled and airlines say they may lose more than $2 billion.

2009 Airline of the Year: Ryanair
2009 Airline of the Year: Ryanair
AirFinance Journal

Length: 658 words
Highlight: Ryanair financed about 60 aircraft in 2009, while continuing to turn a profit. JoAnn DeLuna speaks to the 
finance team.
Body
Under normal economic conditions, airline profits are celebrated. But airline profits were particularly sparse in 2009. 
So, the 2009 Airline of the Year goes to Ryanair for doing what it does best: running a profitable business.
&
Howard Millar, Ryanair's chief financial officer, and Neil Sorahan, Ryanair's head of treasury, say that 2009 
&(EURO)" and even 2010 &(EURO)" will be remembered as difficult years. Both admit that 2009 was made more 
difficult by the airline's decision to expand. Nonetheless, Ryanair continues to trade profitably.
&
&(EURO)oeSome people might say that this is what we've been practicing for,&(EURO) says Millar. &(EURO)oeWe 
were faced with consumers who had a lot less money to spend and certainly it was a challenge to continue to keep 
Europe travelling.We did that by doing what we do best, which was significantly reduced average fares to get more 
and more Europeans to continue to travel.&(EURO)
&
The low-cost Irish carrier has been growing for the past 20 years and continued that by taking delivery of 60 aircraft 
during 2009, expanding routes and increasing passengers by 14% to 66.5 million.
&
&(EURO)oeFor Ryanair to come through the year with such a strong performance, with very strong margins and 
growth, tremendous liquidity &(EURO)" it's a remarkable testament to the resilience of their business model and 
how well managed they are,&(EURO) says Tom Hollahan, global head of aviation, Citi. &(EURO)oeIt was just an 
incredibly solid performance where everything was against the airline industry and yet they just had a great 
year.&(EURO)
&
2009 Airline of the Year: Ryanair
Hollahan adds that he expects airlines in emerging markets such as China, Brazil and India to grow because those 
markets are still underdeveloped. However, for Ryanair to continue growing in mature markets is compelling.
&
The carrier did well in 2009 because it was man-aged well and the management understood how to capitalize on 
opportunities within the context of the economic conditions.
&
&(EURO)oeI don't think anyone can claim business is recession proof. Even we had an impact on our business in 
terms of the recession in the past two years,&(EURO) says Sorahan. &(EURO)oeOur business structure just 
performs better because of a significantly lower cost base and enables us to perform better in times of 
recession.&(EURO)
&
Millar adds that the recession also prompted opportunities for Ryanair to expand in markets where it had not 
originally expected to grow as rapidly &(EURO)" for example, in Italy, Spain and Germany to some extent. A 
combination of airline consolidation or failures along with strong customer demand in those markets presented 
opportunities for growth.
&
In December Ryanair ended negotiations with Boeing for an order of up to 200 737-800s because the companies 
could not agree on a sale price for the aircraft. The airline has no intention of reopening talks.
&
However, this will not affect its plans to grow by between 10% and 11% to 73 million passengers for fiscal year 
2011. The low-cost carrier also plans to take delivery of 55 aircraft to expand its fleet to 280 in that same period.
&
Millar says customers can also expect more of the same: low fares, the lowest levels of cancellations and lost bags 
and the best on-time performance.
&
Can customers also expect loo charges or standing room-only flights?
&
&(EURO)oeWe'll have to wait and see. You can never rule anything out,&(EURO) he says, laughing.
&
Hollahan says Ryanair's success is also partly because of its public relations efforts and a series of statements of 
how it is looking to reduce costs.
&
Regardless of how outrageous the carrier's suggestions may be, Hollahan says they send a message that Ryanair 
will continue to look at ways of reducing fares, which is what customers want.
&
2009 Airline of the Year: Ryanair
&(EURO)oeThey're cheap. They know it,&(EURO) he says. &(EURO)oeThey're proud of it and they keep reminding 
you that they're proud of it. You just have to give them credit.&(EURO)

Irish shares have bounced back strongly this morning from two days of big losses.
The ISEQ index had risen by 66.74 points a short time ago to hit 3,323.76.
The big bounce wiped around a quarter of the index's slide on its two previous sessions.
The recovery comes as markets get over the shocks of debt downgrading earlier this week for Greece, Portugal 
and Spain. There were signs overnight of debt markets calming and of Ireland escaping quite lightly from the fears 
they created. Besides, a warning from the IMF that more urgency is needed to contain the Greek problem has led to 
an intensified effort to reach an enlarged aid deal for Athens this week. Banks did well in Dublin this morning, with 
AIB up 5c to 149 and Bank of Ireland ahead by 7c to 175. Irish Life and Permanent is up 3c to 300. Among the

Irish shares continued in a tailspin this morning as the local market followed a downward global trend on worries

Markets in the US and Asia have dropped sharply overnight, followed by European bourses this morning.
Investors are rattled by yesterday's downgrade of both Greek and Portuguese debt by Standard and Poor's, which 
has sparked new fears that debt contagion may spread across Europe's weaker economies.
The head of Ireland's debt agency, the NTMA moved yesterday to reassure the markets that Ireland can "easily" 
weather the impact of the Greek crisis on financial markets. The two main banks are down in Dublin this morning, in 
line with their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. AIB is off by 5c to 140, while Bank of Ireland is down 4c to 168. 
Irish Life and Permanent has bucked the trend this morning, with a gain early on of 5c to 310. Among the big

Ryanair put thousands of staff on unpaid "standby" during the volcanic ash crisis, according to a weekend report.
The move minimised the financial hit to the carrier caused by the crisis, the Sunday Times reports.
It says that the move meant the staff had to stay close to their airport stations and be ready to resume work quickly 
if services were resumed.
The paper says that among those affected wereabout 300 contract pilots and crew who were stranded away from 
home for up to six days during the suspension of flights. It says they were told to survive on a per diam allowance of 
20 euro, excluding accommodation. The paper estimates that the airline has around 2,000 contract pilots and more 
than 5,000 contract cabin crew. It quotes Ryanair as confirming that they are paid only "by the flight". A 
spokesperson for the airline tells the Times that it does not discuss the detail of its contractual relationship with its 
people. However, they had all received their full contractual entitlements during the no-fly period.

The move minimised the financial hit to the carrier caused by the crisis, the Sunday Times reports.
It says that the move meant the staff had to stay close to their airport stations and be ready to resume work quickly 
if services were resumed.
The paper says that among those affected wereabout 300 contract pilots and crew who were stranded away from 
home for up to six days during the suspension of flights. It says they were told to survive on a per diam allowance of 
20 euro, excluding accommodation. The paper estimates that the airline has around 2,000 contract pilots and more 
than 5,000 contract cabin crew. It quotes Ryanair as confirming that they are paid only "by the flight". A 
spokesperson for the airline tells the Times that it does not discuss the detail of its contractual relationship with its 
people. However, they had all received their full contractual entitlements during the no-fly period.

Volcanic ash has airlines breathing fire

The unforeseeable travel chaos prompted by the activities of an Icelandic volcano has thrown another curveball at 
the travel industry.
As Ryanair and Aer Lingus coped with a shutdown of European airspace, Irish Ferries owner Irish Continental 
Group (ICG) became indispensable to stranded travellers, after already impressing the market with its resilient 
business model and diminishing debt levels.
The grounding of airlines signalled a boon for ICG, which has lost trade to cheaper air travel in recent years.
Bloxham Stockbrokers said that ICG was in pole position to bank additional business. ''With prime sailing slots, 
ample on-board capacity and leading market shares between the UK and Ireland, ICG is well-placed to benefit from 
the surge in demand," said the broker.
''The immediate benefit was seen in foot passenger traffic, with all ferries reporting 100 per cent loads.
Car volume grew, too, but space remained as passengers had to recalibrate travel plans to include ground 
transport," according to Bloxham.
''Using a one-week revenue boost and assuming a 70 per cent-plus cash conversion assumption, we estimate ICG 
could have a 2-3 per cent boost to annual profit due to the volcanic ash event."
While Ryanair and Aer Lingus shareholders have been less than pleased with the volcanic fallout, there is a view in 
the market that Ryanair has suffered unfairly. London based brokers Redburn Partners said that ''Ryanair looks to 
have been sold off most out of the European airlines''.
But Ryanair is among the best positioned to cope with such an unexpected grounding.
Volcanic ash has airlines breathing fire
Analysts said that Ryanair was still operating 40 per cent of its network during the height of the airspace shutdown, 
losing revenue of around  6 million per day. The fall in share price seemed to assume a far greater financial impact, 
however.
Redburn said Ryanair had access to  2 billion at the end of March, enough for more than 300 days of losses.
Redburn said that half of the Ryanair's costs were variable. ''Pilots and cabin crew only get paid when they fly and, 
therefore, are best-placed for the current drama," said Pierra Pattullo. Goodbody also said that Ryanair was saving 
on fuel and airport costs.
These losses could be overshadowed by the legal obligation on Ryanair to cover compensation costs for hotels and 
other expenses of thousands of passengers. Michael O'Leary, the company's chief executive, having initially 
refused to pay out, has accepted that, legally, the airline will have to cover the costs.
Aer Lingus said that the ash fallout cost between  4 million and  5 million a day, as a result of lost revenue and the 
costs of passenger disruption.
However, it said that ''the group has substantial cash reserves and can withstand a sustained closure of airspace''.
Redburn suggested that the volcano was costing British Airways £15 million to »20 million per day, and that 
reserves could keep the company going for 100 days or so. Air France-KLM had liquidity of  3 billion, enough for 
about 75 days of losses.
Even though airline share prices were hit by the uncertainty and revenue losses of the past week, airlines have 
recovered quite quickly from such crises in the past. ''The effect on airline shares, if sustained, could be similar to 
other exogenous events such as 9/11 and Sars," said Stephen Furlong, of Davy Stockbrokers.
''Following 9/11, BA shares closed at 264p on September 10, 2001, and troughed at 139p on October 19 before 
recovering to 220p by mid-November," he said. ''Even Ryanair's share price dropped from 260c on September 10 to 
a low of 187.5c on September 21, before fully recovering by end October and ending the year on a high at 350c.
''In the Sars-related crisis, Asian airlines fell by more than 20 per cent, before fully recovering within six months. So, 
overall, the effects appear to be short-lived," said Furlong.
Few other stocks appeared to be affected by the interruption to air travel. Insurance group FBD, for example, does 
not provide travel insurance and while its hotel business was probably affected by the disruption to tourist plans, but 
it should have little impact on overall numbers. Irish food companies generally transport by sea, so again were 
unaffected.
But a return to business as normal across Europe will no doubt be welcomed by the vast majority of Irish 
companies.

The venue
Stena Plus Lounge, premium service, on Stena Line ferries from Stranraer to Belfast.
Who'd love it?
Families travelling from Ireland to Britain and vice versa, who want a hassle-free journey and happy kids; anyone 
wishing to avoid being grounded due to unpredictable volcanic ash.
Pamper potential
We have often travelled from Scotland to Ireland by plane.
It is not a relaxing journey in any sense of the word.
This is especially true if the carrier is Ryanair, with its attendant scrum for seats, unhelpful staff and time spent 
squashed between garish yellow and blue decor.
We categorise it as: rush and wait, usually delay and feel the stress. The costs are never clear and airport parking 
charges are exorbitant.
So, more recently, we chose to come by ferry. The driving time from our home to Dublin would be four and a half 
hours, with a near two hour ferry journey in-between.
It's not much more than flying when you factor in travelling to the airport, leaving two hours for check-in, possible 
delays, flight time, time spent in the baggage hall and travelling into Dublin city.
Well Travelled
On Saturday morning we drove from the central belt down to Stranraer. The roads were quiet and the weather 
good. Check-in for the ferry was efficient and after a visit to the terminal building, we were invited in the first group 
of cars to drive onto the ferry, by virtue of our Premier boarding class.
Eating in
A few minutes later we were in the Stena Plus Lounge and pouring our complimentary coffees. A variety of teas, 
coffees and soft drinks, along with a selection of snacks, is available throughout the crossing in this lounge. The sea 
was a flat calm.
The lounge is plush, quiet, very well-appointed and allows an uninterrupted panoramic view through the side and 
rear of the vessel.
Menus were handed out by the lounge staff and lunch was quickly served. The food was excellent, plentiful, well 
presented and not expensive.
The whole process is so relaxing.
A feature of this ship is the excellent service provided by the staff. Nothing seems a bother and service is with a 
smile and some light-hearted banter - such a pleasure.
Out and about
After lunch, we took a quick walk through the rest of the ship and returned to the lounge to read a magazine or daily 
paper. There are also quiet outside areas to stroll along or use as viewing platforms if you wish.
Shortly afterwards the ship docked in Belfast and we were soon driving out of the port and along the motorway 
south. Two hours later we arrived at our destination in Dublin.
Traffic on the motorway south from Belfast was light and we had listened to a Harry Potter book on the CD player. 
Our two grandchildren, on their first visit to Ireland, really enjoyed the journey.
What we liked
The service - which was excellent. Browsing through the lounge comments book showed that, without exception, 
every passenger made high praise of the service and the experience.
The whole travel experience is so much better in my opinion than air travel. Well done Stena Line. We have another 
crossing booked already.
What we didn't
Getting the slow ferry back - a three-hour journey as opposed to two.
Cost and contact
A Stena Plus Lounge return journey in May costs £363 for three adults, two children and one car. Cost includes pre-
booked, prepaid meals and premium service. See www.stenaline.ie or tel: 012047733.

Ashes to clashes
Eyjafjallajökull completed its transformation from obscure Icelandic place name to travel trade expletive as volcanic 
ash continued to paralyse flights in and out of the UK until Wednesday.
As tempers frayed among stranded passengers, debate raged between airlines and regulators over the scale of the 
threat posed by the volcanic eruptions, prompting Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways, to state by 
Tuesday: "I don't believe it was necessary to impose a blanket ban on all UK airspace."
By Wednesday it was chocks away as airlines scrambled to amend flight plans to cope with a Dunkirk-scale task of 
returning Brits home as airspace was re-opened.
But liability for the costs of cancelled flights remained a serious concern for stranded passengers, as Ryanair 
threatened to defy European law that obliges carriers to pay hotel and food costs of those whose flights are 
cancelled.
By Thursday Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive renowned for his own use of non-Icelandic expletives, 
performed a U-turn, saying his airline would reluctantly comply with EU rules on passenger compensation.
Game over
Shares in Game Group fell 12 per cent on Wednesday after it confirmed that two of its most senior executives were 
quitting the company.
News of the departure of Lisa Morgan, chief executive, and Terry Scicluna, chief operating officer, was taken badly 
in the City, with analysts concerned about a power vacuum at the top just as the computer games retailer embarks 
on a new strategy to improve its sluggish performance.
Ms Morgan left with immediate effect on Wednesday, while Mr Scicluna also decided to step down after Game said 
it would search for a successor from outside the group.
The big stories
Chris Bell, the former chief executive of Ladbrokes, was appointed interim chief executive.
Arriva GmbH
German state-owned rail operator Deutsche Bahn said it was placing Sunderland at the centre of its European 
expansion plans after it agreed to buy the UK-based international bus and rail group Arriva for £1.5bn.
Described by some as a John F Kennedy-style "Ich bin ein Sunderlander" pledge, Deutsche Bahn boss Rüdiger 
Grube declared "we are placing our hopes in Sunderland" and said the Arriva brand would function as the 
international business arm for Deutsche Bahn.
Virgin accused
Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic airline moved to defend its reputation after Britain's competition watchdog this 
week accused it for the second time of conspiring with a rival to fix prices charged to passengers.
The Office of Fair Trading claimed that employees of Cathay Pacific Airways and Virgin exchanged commercially 
sensitive information between 2002 and 2006 to co-ordinate ticket prices on the London-Hong Kong route.

Two of the world's top three ratings agencies - Moody's and Standard and Poor - have said that Ireland's sovereign 
debt rating has been unaffected by changes to Eurostat's calculation of our deficit to GDP ratio. Meanwhile, Greek 
Prime Minister George Papandreou on Friday asked for the activation of an EU/IMF aid package aimed at pulling 
the euro zone member out of a debt crisis. "It is imperative that we ask for the activation of the mechanism," 
Papandreou said while visiting the remote Aegean island of Kastellorizo.
Shares in AIB were flat at E1.50, Bank of Ireland was also unmoved at E1.81 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 
2c to E3.12. The value of highway contracts awarded in the US in March increased by 49pc to over dollar 4.2bn 
compared to March last year. This follows a 93pc increase in February and leaves the first quarter figure 46pc 
ahead of Q1 2009. This is the most important gauge of highway spending in the US as it reflects a real commitment 
of cash by state DOTs. Once contracts are awarded, they typically commence within three months. Shares in CRH

stated that airlines would incur added costs related to re-routing of aircraft, care for passengers and stranded 
aircraft at various ports. European airlines have provided various estimates of the financial impact. Low-cost 
carriers with low fixed costs and no connecting passengers are the least affected. Shares in Ryanair rose 8c to

Two of the world's top three ratings agencies - Moody's and Standard and Poor - have said that Ireland's sovereign

News that two of the three top global ratings agencies will be making no change to their outlook on Irish debt and 
the imminent triggering of the EU/IMF aid for Greece helped lift the ISEQ sharply today.
By 12:30, the index had climbed 82.19 points to 3,447.13.
Two of the world's top three ratings agencies - Moody's and Standard and Poor - have said that Ireland's sovereign 
debt rating has been unaffected by changes to Eurostat's calculation of our deficit to GDP ratio. Standard and 
Poor's said today that the Irish government's revision of its 2009 general government deficit estimate from 11.8pc of 
GDP to 14.3pc, which the Government said is mainly due to a different accounting treatment being applied to the 
E4 billion (2.5pc of GDP) injected into Anglo Irish Bank in 2009, has no impact on the sovereign ratings. Moody's 
said Ireland's current Aa1 sovereign rating with a negative outlook is not affected by the announcement by Eurostat 
that Ireland's budget deficit in 2009 was 14.3pc of GDP rather than 11.7pc, says Moody's Investors Service.
Meanwhile, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou on Friday asked for the activation of an EU/IMF aid package 
aimed at pulling the euro zone member out of a debt crisis. "It is imperative that we ask for the activation of the 
mechanism," Papandreou said while visiting the remote Aegean island of Kastellorizo. Shares in AIB rose 5c to 
E1.55, Bank of Ireland gained 2c to E1.83 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 5c to E3.15. The value of highway 
contracts awarded in the US in March increased by 49pc to over dollar 4.2bn compared to March last year. This 
follows a 93pc increase in February and leaves the first quarter figure 46pc ahead of Q1 2009. This is the most 
important gauge of highway spending in the US as it reflects a real commitment of cash by state DOTs. Once 
contracts are awarded, they typically commence within three months. Shares in CRH jumped 94c to E21.14. The 
International Air Transport Association (IATA) has indicated that for the three-day period (April 17th-19th) when air 
disruptions were greatest, lost revenues reached dollar 400m per day. It also stated that airlines would incur added 
costs related to re-routing of aircraft, care for passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports. European airlines 
ISEQ surges ahead on ratings hold ISEQ up
have provided various estimates of the financial impact. Low-cost carriers with low fixed costs and no connecting 
passengers are the least affected. Shares in Ryanair rose 7c to E3.91.

Body
Budget airline Ryanair has backed down in a row over compensation for victims of the Icelandic ash crisis, as the 
European Commission warned low-cost airlines not to "discount" passengers' rights.
Europe's largest low-cost carrier said it would comply with an "unfair" European law that requires airlines to pay the 
hotel and food costs of people stranded without flights, after refusing at first to repay more than the cost of the air 
ticket.
The argument over costs soured the homecoming of thousands of people forced to run up credit card debts or 
borrow money due to the six-day shutdown of large areas of European airspace due to fears of air crashes caused 
by ash from an Icelandic volcano.
Airlines say flights are now running at near normal levels but it could take weeks to complete the repatriation of 
millions of people affected by the disruption worldwide, with some travellers not being offered flights until May. 
Eurocontrol says almost all air restrictions have ended, with just a small number of cancellations due to logistical 
problems. Air France-KLM and others have announced extra flights. Norway, which had been among the first 
countries to respond to last week's volcano eruption by clearing its airspace, has now reopened its airways. But 
Iceland, which had kept its airports open, closed its airspace yesterday because of a change in wind direction. The 
wind had previously taken ash from the volcano under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier away from the island, towards 
continental Europe. Ryanair's outspoken boss had been criticised by politicians and in newspapers for not 
committing to reimbursing passengers affected by the closure of airspace. "We have caved in to the pressure in the 
newspapers and from our own customers. We've said we'll comply now, but it's not because of any pressure from 
some idiot politician," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said. The European Commission said all airlines should 
respect passenger rights. "There are no discount air passenger rights for discount airlines," Commission transport 
spokeswoman Helen Kearns said. "Ryanair will have to apply them like everyone else." Airlines are in their own

battle for compensation, with the International Air Transport Association urging governments to examine ways to 
help the industry cope with lost revenues. The global airline lobbying group estimates the cost of the crisis to 
airlines in lost revenues at USD 1.7 billion, but the industry also saved some USD 660 million on costs such as fuel. 
Airlines are expected to lose USD 2.8 billion this year as they clamber out of recession, IATA said before the 
volcano crisis. Sweden was one of the first countries to outline support measures for airlines including a two-month 
break from a social fees payroll tax and a 90-day suspension of airport charges. Economists said it could be months 
before the full effect of the shutdown was fully understood, but the impact on the travel and leisure industry alone 
could be double the cost to airlines. Air fares are expected to be higher for a while as airlines, already flying their 
planes nearly full after slashing capacity to cope with the downturn, have relatively few seats on offer. "The 
shockwaves can ripple throughout the year as people cancel and then try to reschedule their trips," said Peter 
Morris, chief economist at UK aviation consultancy Ascend. "While airline capacity will go quickly back to normal, 
there isn't a big stock of planes waiting to be used in the event of a crisis," he said. Planes are on average flying 75 
percent full. "It could be June before all the echoes of this disruption have gone through the system," Morris said. 
Freight will be re-routed more quickly but some perishable produce such as Kenyan flowers will be lost for good. 
Iceland's volcanic eruption was meanwhile still causing strong tremors on Thursday, though far less ash and smoke 
was pouring out into the air.

Ryanair yesterday made a U-turn on passenger reimbursement, saying it would compensate ticket holders who had 
been stranded owing to the volcanic ash disruptions.
The decision brought the low-cost airline into line with other European carriers that have mostly stated - albeit with 
varying degrees of enthusiasm - their intention to reimburse travellers.
Ryanair said it disagreed with European rules on compensation for airline passengers, but would meet the 
"reasonable receipted expenses" of customers stranded because of airspace restrictions.
"The events of the last seven days, under which Europe's airlines were prevented from flying by the closure of 
European airspace, highlight how absurd and discriminatory the EU261 regulations are towards Europe's airlines," 
said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair.
"While competitor ferry, coach and train operators are obliged to reimburse passengers reasonable expenses, this 
reimbursement is limited to the ticket price paid to those operators. Yet the airlines are required by regulation to 
meet potentially unlimited expenses."
Other airlines operating in Europe said they had adhered to the European regulations.
"We comply with the law," Easyjet said. "We have paid for 100,000 hotel nights already."
BMI said it would cover "reasonable expenses" for people stranded abroad, but declined to clarify what the criteria 
were, adding it had provided hotel accommodation to some stranded passengers for "medical purposes".
The group said that the European Union requirement to pay for accommodation and food was "down to 
interpretation".
Scandinavian carrier SAS said it would provide hotel accommodation and transfers to all customers stranded by the 
ash disruptions.

Michael O'Leary's strategy at Ryanair is based on a brutal but usually sound assumption: there are plenty of 
cheapskates out there who will take the lowest air fare available, irrespective of the risk of delay or discomfort.
The Irishman's U-turn yesterday on his earlier determination that Ryanair should not reimburse ash-stranded 
passengers beyond the value of their tickets is a rare acknowledgement that for a moment he misread the mood.
It was an odd error for him to make when other options were so clearly available. Airlines have proved time and 
again that the path of least resistance when facing financial pain is to wheel their begging trolley up the aisle to 
Brussels and claim state subsidies. Icelandic volcano risk was never anticipated when European Union legislation 
on compensation was drawn up. EU citizens are already up in arms. The case for airlines to get relief from some of 
the burden is strong.
But for Mr O'Leary to persist in saying that customers should bear most of the short-term cost of cancellation would 
have risked breaking the law and created a far more damaging impression: that Ryanair is an airline that will leave 
you in the lurch when natural disaster strikes.
Just as this was the eruption that proved the rule that airlines should compensate passengers for excessive delays, 
so it provided the rare instance in which the O'Leary Theory doesn't apply. For once, the volcanically tempered 
Ryanair boss can only pay up and mutter "Eyjafjallajökull". Or words to that effect.

Penny-pinching airline Ryanair did a surprise U-turn Thursday and agreed to pay the hotel and food bills of tens of 
thousands of customers left stranded during Europe's volcano-ash crisis.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary had initially vowed Wednesday to limit customers' payments to the original cost of 
their air fare which in Ryanair's case can be very low. He called the EU laws "absurd" and declared his desire to 
"expose this nonsense" in a landmark legal challenge.
But the European Union, which enforces consumer laws that hold airlines responsible for stranded passengers' 
"reasonable costs," warned Ryanair it could face fines ranging from (EURO)5,000 to (EURO)150,000 ($6,750 to 
$202,500) per complaint.
O'Leary's fighting talk quickly gave way to contrition.
"Michael realizes that he got this wrong," Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara said Thursday.
The reversal of policy unexpected from a cash-rich airline renowned for fighting EU judgments in courts across 
Europe means Ryanair will pay out claims to a minority of the airline's approximately 1 million customers who 
suffered canceled flights over the past week.
Ryanair officials declined to offer any estimate of their potential liabilities. They said the airline will reimburse 
receipted expenses only to customers who did not request a ticket refund or make alternative travel plans. So only 
those customers who stayed put and waited for a replacement Ryanair service would get their hotel and meal costs 
repaid.
That would comply with European consumer law and is the policy broadly being observed by other European 
airlines.
O'Leary appealed Thursday to the European Commission and the European Parliament to reform their laws on 
passengers' reimbursement rights, saying they discriminate against airlines.
Ryanair U-turn, will pay stranded customers' bills
Payouts for stranded passengers of ferry, rail and bus services are capped at the original ticket cost "yet the airlines 
are required by regulation to meet potentially unlimited expenses," O'Leary said.
Ryanair was particularly assertive among European airlines in canceling services well in advance during the 
Europe-wide uncertainty caused by drifting clouds of volcanic ash. Ryanair shut down throughout northern Europe 
April 15 and relaunched most flights Thursday, a day later than many airlines. This means Ryanair's qualifying 
stranded customers may receive reimbursements for hotels and food for a full week easily a (EURO)1,000 bill for a 
(EURO)100 ticket.
Ryanair previously estimated it was losing (EURO)6 million ($8.1 million) per day, or (EURO)42 million ($56.7 
million) total, because of the week's lost business. The airline has continued to expand and build market share 
throughout Europe's recession and retains cash reserves exceeding (EURO)2 billion.
Any reform in EU law capping an airline's compensation obligations at the original air fare would suit Ryanair better 
than most airlines.
Ryanair has led the aviation industry in reshaping its charges regime so that its up-front air fares are often 
negligible. But customers end up paying much more with charges for on-line check-in, use of debit or credit cards 
and checked luggage, as well as add-on taxes and airport fees.

Ryanair this morning said that it will comply with what it called the "unfair" EU261 regulations that require airlines to 
pay reasonable reimbursements to passengers affected by the volcanic ash cloud closures and delays.
This represents a u-turn from its previous stance of refusing to pay out5 under the regulations.
It called the EU261 rules "absurd" but said it would comply with regulations under which EU airlines are required to 
reimburse the reasonable receipted expenses (as set out in EU261) of disrupted passengers.
Speaking today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "The events of the last seven days, under which Europe's airlines 
were prevented from flying by the closure of European airspace highlight how absurd and discriminatory the EU261 
regulations are towards Europe's airlines. While competitor ferry, coach and train operators are obliged to 
reimburse passengers reasonable expenses, this reimbursement is limited to the ticket price paid to those 
operators. "Yet the airlines are required by regulation to meet potentially unlimited expenses, in circumstances 
where there has been a catastrophic closure of European airspace over the past seven days, as EU governments 
and regulators wrongly applied a blanket ban on flights over European airspace. "Ryanair has long campaigned for 
these reimbursements under passenger rights legislation to be limited to the ticket price paid in the same way they 
are for train, coach and ferry operators. "We will continue to work through the European Low Fares Airlines 
Association (ELFAA) and other industry bodies to persuade the European Commission and the European 
Parliament to alter this regulation to put this reasonable limit on these reimbursement claims."

Highlight: Ban said to have cost airlines $1.7bn
Normal service to resume in weeks
Body
Thousands of travellers stranded by the Icelandic ash cloud began flying home as London's Heathrow airport 
became the last one in the UK to open after the end of a six-day flight ban that is estimated to have cost airlines 
$1.7bn.
The end to the flight ban prompted claims that governments throughout Europe had overreacted to the ash cloud 
and should compensate the industry.
Willie Walsh, British Airways chief executive, said he did not believe the blanket ban imposed on UK airspace last 
Thursday had been necessary. "My personal belief is that we could have safely continued operating for a period of 
time."
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the top long-haul airlines at Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, aim to operate 
all their inter-continental services today.
But there will still be short-haul cancellations to and from London airports. With aircraft and crew scattered where 
they were grounded last Thursday, timetables will be ruined. Restrictions remain in Finland and parts of Scotland.
More than 100,000 flights have been cancelled since the eruption began, says Eurocontrol, which co-ordinates 
routes in the region.
Gordon Brown, the UK prime minister, said night flying rules might be relaxed to help get people home. "We were 
making contingency arrangements to get people though the Channel and to get people from Spain," he said. "But 
now it looks as if we can get lots of people back, and I think you will find that our airports are open longer to make 
that possible."
Accusations fly as airways reopen
More than 100,000 British travellers remain stranded around the world and airlines warned it could take several 
days or even weeks before normal service resumes. "To get back to normal levels of operation from an industry 
point of view will take weeks," Mr Walsh told BBC television.
With aircraft having flown successful test flights for several days, recriminations have started about why 
governments took as long as they did to give the green light to the airline industry.
The International Air Transport Association (Iata) estimates that airlines globally have lost $1.7bn (£1.1bn). BA has 
lost up to £20m daily, Tui (representing Thomson and First Choice) £6m, EasyJet £5m, Ryanair £5.2m, Air 
France/KLM £30.5m, Emirates £6.5m and Qantas £900,000.
"For an industry that lost $9.4bn last year and was forecast to lose a further $2.8bn in 2010, this crisis is 
devastating," Giovanni Bisignani, Iata director general and chief executive, said yesterday.
He urged governments to examine ways to compensate airlines, which he said would take three years to recover. 
"It is an extraordinary situation exaggerated with a poor decision-making process by national governments."
Despite their losses, airlines managed to save about $110m a day on costs such as fuel, Iata said.
In Britain the Foreign Office advised travellers to contact their airlines to ass-ess the quickest way home.
EasyJet hoped to run 900 flights yesterday (86 per cent of its network), with 140,000 passengers, while Ryanair 
said there would be no flights until after 5am today.

Highlight: Airlines allege official overreaction
BA says normality is weeks away
Body
European airports and airlines were scrambling to restore flights yesterday amid claims that governments 
overreacted to the ash cloud and should compensate the industry.
About 75 per cent of flights in Europe were expected to take to the air yesterday - 21,000 of the 28,000 flights 
normally scheduled each day, European air traffic agency Eurocontrol said.
British Airways said it would operate all its long-haul flights departing from Heathrow and Gatwick airports yesterday 
- after the UK reopened its airspace on Tuesday night - but there would be short-haul cancellations to and from 
London airports.
Flights began leaving Heathrow soon after 8am yesterday. But with aircraft and crew scattered where they were 
grounded last Thursday, it could be some time before schedules return to normal.
"To get back to normal levels of operation from an industry point of view will take weeks," Willie Walsh, BA chief 
executive, told BBC television.
Officials at Heathrow are seeking permission to allow overnight take-offs and landings to clear the backlog.
More than 100,000 British travellers remain stranded around the world and airlines warned it could take several 
days or even weeks before normal service resumes.
With aircraft having flown successful test flights for several days, recriminations have started about why European 
governments took as long as they did to give the green light to the airline industry.
The International Air Transport Association estimated that airlines globally had lost $1.7bn (EUR1.3bn, £1.1bn). BA 
has lost up to £20m daily, TUI (representing Thomson and First Choice) £6m, EasyJet £5m, Ryanair £5.2m, Air 
France/KLM £30.5m, Emirates £6.5m and Qantas £900,000.

"For an industry that lost $9.4bn last year and was forecast to lose a further $2.8bn in 2010, this crisis is 
devastating," said Giovanni Bisignani, Iata director-general and chief executive.

an extraordinary situation exaggerated with a poor decision-making process by national governments," he said.
Despite their losses, airlines did save about $110m a day on costs such as fuel, Iata said.
In Britain the Foreign Office advised travellers to contact their airlines to assess what the quickest way home would 
be.
Consular officials in Spain organised for five coaches to carry about 250 Britons from Madrid to Calais but said it 
might now be quicker to wait for a flight. Plans for 150 coaches to head from Dover to Madrid this morning have 
been put on hold.
The economic impact of the cloud has already hit parts of the supply chain and could potentially dent the fragile 
recovery from the global recession.
PwC, the professional services firm, estimated a week of disruption could destroy 0.025-0.05 per cent of annual 
British gross domestic product, and the same would probably be true of other European countries. But Germany 
said the impact on its economy would be limited.

Brussels to assess airline action on refunds

Highlight: Compensation
Body
The European Commission warned yesterday that it would take into consideration how airlines treated their 
stranded passengers during the ash crisis when deciding whether they -qualify for state aid.
State aid and passenger rights are separate issues. Nevertheless, officials said compensation behaviour and costs 
would inform their assessment of the impact, which in turn could influence any future state aid concessions for the 
industry, which has lost $1.7bn (EUR1.3bn, £1.1bn) during the past week's crisis, according to the Inter-national Air 
Transport Association.
The move comes as Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he would wait for his day in court after the 
budget carrier warned customers it would not be held liable for their hotel and restaurant bills.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would reimburse travellers the original price of their air fare and no more.
"There's no legislation designed that says any airline getting a fare of EUR30 should be reimbursing passengers 
many thousands of euro for hotel accommodation. It's absurd,'' he said.
Ryanair carries on average 220,000 passengers on flights across Europe every day, but Mr O'Leary said he was 
not able to estimate how many of his customers had been left stranded.
It has cancelled all flights between Ireland and the UK until tomorrow to divert aircraft cover more indemand airports 
across Europe.
In Brussels an official said Siim Kallas, the European transport commissioner, was "very clear that compensation 
and financial duties will be taken into account when we look at the impact of the crisis".
Mr Kallas said he was "very, very concerned" by allegations that some airlines were refusing to pay for stranded 
passengers' hotels or demanding that rerouted travellers sign papers waiving their rights.
Brussels to assess airline action on refunds
Against intense airline lobbying, the EU approved passenger rights legislation in 2004 to address over-bookings by 
carriers and other abuses that were causing frequent delays.
Passengers whose flights are cancelled or heavily delayed can choose to have a refund of their fare or be rerouted. 
If they take the latter option, their carrier has a duty of care towards them in the meantime, including the provision of 
food, overnight accommodation, and even telephone calls, as appropriate.
The law also calls for compensation for stranded passengers ranging from EUR250 ($335, £215) to EUR600 - 
although this has been waived in the current circumstance because the volcanic eruption was considered an 
unforeseen event.

A Delta Airlines flight from the US is set to be the first flight to land at Dublin Airport, following last night's re-opening 
of Irish air space.
The flight from Atlanta is due at around 9am this morning, and the plane is also set to be the first flight to depart the 
airport when it leaves at 10 am.
The re-opening of the country's airspace comes after six days of disruption caused by the ash cloud from a volcano 
in Iceland.
Flights in and out of Irish airports are expected to take up to three days to return to normal, according to the Irish 
Aviation Authority. Flights today are expected initially to involve the repositioning of aircraft to allow them to resume 
scheduled services. Aer Lingus is, however, hoping to resume passenger carrying flights by this afternoon. Ryanair 
is to resume flights to and from the continent and on routes to and from the UK on Friday. The Irish Aviation 
Authority has emphasised that the reopening of Irish air space could be reversed if a return of the ash cloud to Irish 
skies is prompted by further activity from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano. Speaking on the Morning Ireland radio 
programme on RTE this morning, Siobhan Moore of the Dublin Airport Authority predicted a "phased and slow" 
return to business today. Passengers are still being advised to check with airline websites before setting out for the 
airport. Shannon Airport had a number of flight arrivals last night, with an Aer Lingus flight from Tenerife bringing 
around 100 stranded Irish holidaymakers home. A number of British Airways long haul aircraft also passed through 
the airport as they awaited the reopening of airspace over Britain.

The main Dublin shares index broke through the 3,400 mark today as airlines rebounded from the ash-cloud lows of 
the past week and CRH shares jumped on signs that the US is getting back to building more highways.
By market's close the ISEQ had gained 36.09 points to 3,406.47.
Shares in Ryanair rose 7c to E3.90 and Aer Lingus gained 1c to E0.71 amid real signs that Europe's airlines, 
grounded for a week because of the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud, will be back to close-to normal by the start of next 
week. Irish airspace has reopened for flight operations after six days of disruption. However, the Irish Aviation 
Authority has warned that it may take up to three days for full services to resume. It is expected that today's flights 
will focus on positioning aircraft and crews and full service by the airlines may take up to three days to resume.
The US architectural billings index, a lead indicator of future non-residential construction activity, improved 
significantly in March to 46.1 - the highest reading recorded since August 2008. The index has steadily improved 
this year having fallen to 42.5 following a mini-revival in late 2009. A reading above 50 indicates an increase in 
billings. The index provides an approximate nine-to-twelve-month glimpse into future non-residential construction 
activity in the US. Shares in CRH, which derives close to half of all group revenues from the US, jumped 58c to 
E20.48. Irish drugmaker Elan says it remains on target to record full-year operating profits before other charges for 
the first time in several years, after recording first-quarter profits of USD 32.7 million this morning. That compared to 
a loss of USD 54.8 million for the same period last year as Elan, in which Johnson and Johnson has an 18pc stake, 
reduced operating expenses by 23 percent and saw revenues grow by 27pc. Elan's shares climbed 10c to E5.70. 
For the year to end-January 2010, Game Group reported an operating profit (before exceptionals) of £94.8m, down 
27.6pc year-on-year. The group recorded a 170 basis point improvement in gross margin (the lower end of the

Shares in AIB dipped 5c to E1.55, Bank of Ireland lost 3c to E1.82 while Irish Life and Permanent slumped 23c to 
E2.55. The day of BoI's capital issue fast approaches, however, media commentary indicates that the bank is 
preparing to announce its issue as early as Monday, but will be unable to set the rights price for the next three 
weeks as it awaits conclusion of the debt for equity swap component of the package, particularly as the bank is 
obliged to leave the offer open for a few weeks to US bondholders (similar to the Lloyds offer last 
November/December). An EGM is being pencilled in for mid-May to approve the transaction, which presumably 
means the placing happens afterwards. We note from the Lloyds offer in November, that the dealing in new shares 
took place 3 weeks after the rights terms were set, so this process could run into June.

preparing to announce its issue as early as Monday, but will be unable to set the rights price for the next three 
weeks as it awaits conclusion of the debt for equity swap component of the package, particularly as the bank is 
obliged to leave the offer open for a few weeks to US bondholders (similar to the Lloyds offer last 
November/December). An EGM is being pencilled in for mid-May to approve the transaction, which presumably 
means the placing happens afterwards. We note from the Lloyds offer in November, that the dealing in new shares 
took place 3 weeks after the rights terms were set, so this process could run into June.

The main Dublin shares index broke through the 3,400 mark today as airlines rebounded from the ash-cloud lows of 
the past week and CRH shares jumped on signs that the US is getting back to building more highways.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 36.09 points to 3,406.47.
Shares in Ryanair rose 5c to E3.88 and Aer Lingus gained 3c to E0.73 amid real signs that Europe's airlines, 
grounded for a week because of the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud, will be back to close-to normal by the start of next 
week. Irish airspace has reopened for flight operations after six days of disruption. However, the Irish Aviation 
Authority has warned that it may take up to three days for full services to resume. It is expected that today's flights 
will focus on positioning aircraft and crews and full service by the airlines may take up to three days to resume.
The US architectural billings index, a lead indicator of future non-residential construction activity, improved 
significantly in March to 46.1 - the highest reading recorded since August 2008. The index has steadily improved 
this year having fallen to 42.5 following a mini-revival in late 2009. A reading above 50 indicates an increase in 
billings. The index provides an approximate nine-to-twelve-month glimpse into future non-residential construction 
activity in the US. Shares in CRH, which derives close to half of all group revenues from the US, jumped 57c to 
E20.47. Irish drugmaker Elan says it remains on target to record full-year operating profits before other charges for 
the first time in several years, after recording first-quarter profits of USD 32.7 million this morning. That compared to 
a loss of USD 54.8 million for the same period last year as Elan, in which Johnson and Johnson has an 18pc stake, 
reduced operating expenses by 23 percent and saw revenues grow by 27pc. Elan's shares climbed 7c to E5.67. 
For the year to end-January 2010, Game Group reported an operating profit (before exceptionals) of £94.8m, down 
27.6pc year-on-year. The group recorded a 170 basis point improvement in gross margin (the lower end of the

European shares rebounded yesterday from the previous day's losses, boosted by carmakers, banks and better-
than-expected German economic sentiment data.
Car stocks rose after Daimler doubled its profit forecast for its Mercedes Benz unit. The German luxury carmaker's 
shares leapt 7.4 per cent to EUR39 after Daimler said demand for Mercedes limousines was strong.
Other carmakers jumped on the positive sentiment. Fiat in Italy added 3.6 per cent to EUR9.88, Germany's BMW 
advanced 4 per cent to EUR36.71 and France's Peugeot rose 3.2 per cent to EUR22.46.
Arndt Ellinghorst at Credit Suisse said that, although European first-quarter car sales were up 12 per cent he was 
convinced that the European mass market would be a problem later this year.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 1.4 per cent to 1,103.46.
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax jumped 1.7 per cent to 6,264.23 after German investor confidence rose for the first time in 
seven months in April, according to the Mannheim-based ZEW economic think tank's monthly poll of economic 
sentiment.
Banks were higher after Goldman Sachs reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations. BNP Paribas rose 1 
per cent to EUR55.88 while Deutsche Bank added 2.2 per cent to EUR55.74.
Greek banking stocks rose after the country's finance minister George Papaconstantinou said the European Union 
was committed to covering Greece's short-term financing.
The comments came ahead of talks today to discuss what fiscal measures the Greek government should take over 
the next two years.
Piraeus Bank  fell 2.7 per cent to EUR6.15 while Alpha Bank  added 5.8 per cent to EUR6.60.
Daimler's optimism kickstarts car rally
Although many flights remained cancelled, European airports made tentative steps towards resuming air travel after 
the ash cloud from Iceland stopped traffic.
Air Berlin rose 2.2 per cent to EUR4.10, German peer Lufthansa added 1.8 per cent to EUR12.62 and Iberia in 
Spain rose 1.9 per cent to EUR2.54.
Andrew Evans at Nomura said the European airline sector had lost 7 per cent of its value since the closure of air 
space.
However "while the closure is unprecedented, we believe the current situation is not comparable with previous 
events such as 9/11 and Sars, and we believe there are selected buying opportunities as a result of the recent sell-
off," he added, recommending Ryanair . The Irish carrier's shares added 1.7 per cent to EUR3.83.
Raiffeisen International Bank  rose 10.7 per cent to EUR39.80 after the Austrian lender announced that its 
minority shareholders would own up to 22 per cent of the company after its merger with units of majority 
shareholder Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich.
Lanxess in Germany added 5.9 per cent to EUR34.92 after the speciality chemicals maker said it was expanding 
production capacity for high-technology plastics at its Wuxi site in China.
Safran rose 1.1 per cent to EUR19.10 after the French aerospace group's chief executive said it had made 
"significant progress" in talks to buy a unit of state chemicals company SNPE and expected to finalise a deal in the 
coming months.
Orion , the Finnish pharmaceutical company, added 3 per cent to EUR13.97 after it said phase three studies of its 
dexmedetomidine sedative drug had recorded positive results, meaning it could now apply for European marketing 
authorisation.

Elan shares lifted by more than 1pc in Dublin this morning after the drugs company announced a swing into 
operating profits for Q1.
Its rise of 6c to 566 came as it reported a 25pc rise in sales of its flagship multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri in the 
quarter.
Overall the ISEQ index is 46.66 points ahead at 3,417.04, its second day of strong gains.
The nrise in the index is tracking gains in markets abroad, on conviction that the global recovery is holding up. Big 
names firms with much to gain from an upturn showed strong rises. CRH is ahead by 34c this morning at 2024, with 
distribution group DCC rising by 23c to 2106. The market's two airlines showed gains as European skies reopen 
after the Icelandic ash crisis. Aer Lingus is up 1c to 71 and Ryanair has rallied by 7c to 390. It was not a positive 
morning for the banks, however. AIB is flat on 160, but Bank of Ireland is down 1c to 184 and Irish Life and 
Permanent has shed 2c to 345. Other big names were mixed. Glanbia is up 6c to 336, but Smurfit Kappa is down

Tenerife to Madrid to allow all passengers who were disrupted on the Islands by the recent volcanic ash emissions 
to get to mainland Europe to allow them to make their return journeys via road, rail or ferry (onward travel from 
Madrid will be at each passenger's own expense).
Ryanair passengers who have been disrupted by cancelled flights to/from the Canary Islands now have the option 
of transferring from their already disrupted flights to these extra Madrid flights free of charge using the airlines Web 
site.
A limited number of seats will be available to passengers who opted for a refund from Ryanair, but still find 
themselves disrupted on the Canary Islands, for a special one way fare E100 (inc taxes and charges). Ryanair's 
Stephen McNamara said: "Any disrupted Ryanair passenger on the Canary Islands now has the choice to fly to 
Madrid so that they may continue their return journeys by road, rail or ferry. Ryanair passengers who have suffered 
disruptions due to the recent volcanic ash airspace closures can now transfer to these extra flights on Wednesday 
and Thursday free of charge, subject to availability. A limited number of seats will also be available for just E100 for 
all other disrupted passengers who need to get from the Canary Islands to the Spanish mainland. "Ryanair will 
continue to announce extra flights and revised plans to clear the backlog of passengers as soon as weather 
conditions and airspace reopening allow".

Highlight: A new delay has put back plans to restart flights in and out of Ireland until at least one o'clock this 
afternoon.
Body
A new delay has put back plans to restart flights in and out of Ireland until at least one o'clock this afternoon.
It had been expected that Irish air space would reopen at five o'clock this morning, but an announcement from the 
Irish Aviation Authority in the early hours put this on hold.
It said the cause was a renewed eruption from the volcano in Iceland yesterday.
This had left Ireland in a zone of contamination, which meant the reopening would be delayed for eight hours. "The 
density of volcanic ash over Irish airspace is such that restrictions will have to continue," it said. The authority is to 
provide an update in mid morning, raising fears that the one o'clock time might be further delayed. Separately, the 
Dublin Airport Authority has said that, effectively, it meant there would be no flights in or out of Dublin today. Aer 
Lingus sees a resumption of its schedule today as "extremely unlikely", and Ryanair has already cancelled all Irish 
flights until 1pm tomorrow. Flights from large parts of Europe are resuming today under a deal to free up airspace, 
though strengthened eruptions from an Icelandic volcano are threatening to stall the process. British air traffic 
controllers warned a new ash cloud was headed for major air routes, prompting British Airways to cancel its short-
haul flights, while several countries either closed airports anew or curtailed use of their airspace. Poland, which had 
reopened four airports yesterday, closed them again this morning, as well as shutting the northern part of its 
airspace to transit flights, citing the ash cloud. Hungary closed part of its western airspace below 6,000 m due to 
higher amounts of volcanic ash, its air traffic authority said. Britain's biggest airports remained closed, and even 
where flights resumed, at the Edinburgh and Glasgow airports in Scotland, the service was limited. "It's really just 
Scottish domestic flights, maybe a couple of international ones, there's one going to Iceland -- yes, it's ironic, isn't 
it?" said Glasgow airport information officer Steven Boyle. Details remained sketchy of how the authorities would 
split European airspace into areas where aircraft could fly or not and other countries were adopting a more cautious 
approach.

The Dublin shares market made strong gains in morning trading with banks and Glanbia leading the pack while 
CRH also helped lift the index.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had risen by 41.77 points to 3,368.99.
Shares in AIB rose 6c to E1.61 after US regional bank, M and T reported a first quarter diluted earnings per share 
of USD1.15, an increase of 135pc year-on-year and 11pc on the linked quarter. The result was also ahead of 
consensus expectations of 99c as the bank reported stable operating profit quarter-on-quarter (qoq), but credit 
losses showed a marked deterioration, falling 28pc. Net interest income of dollar 546m was in line with Q4 (dollar 
565m) as the bank continued to widen its net interest margin, by 7bps in the quarter to 3.78pc, offsetting a decline 
of dollar 120m of average interest earning assets in the quarter. AIB owns over 20pc of the bank and has said it is 
seeking a buyer for the shareholding to bolster its balance sheet at home.
Shares in Bank of Ireland climbed 6c to E1.81 and Irish Life and Permanent jumped 9c to E3.46. Elsewhere, shares 
in food group, Glanbia, surged by 23c to E3.28 after it conditionally agreed to sell its Irish dairy and agri-business to 
Glanbia Co-Operative Society, for up to E343m. The society owns 54.6pc of the company. The Irish dairy and agri-
business is made up of three main business units - dairy ingredients Ireland, consumer products and agribusiness, 
as well as Glanbia estates, group business services and Irish joint ventures and associates. Shares in Aer Lingus 
fell 1c to E0.71 after it said that the disruption caused by the Icelandic volcano eruption has cost the airline between 
E15m and E20m. In a statement this morning, it said it was losing E4-5m a day. However, the airline said it had 
substantial cash reserves and could withstand a sustained closure of airspace. Shares in Ryanair gaied 6c to 
E3.83. Smurfit Kappa Group has completed an asset swap deal with Mondi at a net cost to SKG of E51m. SKG is 
paying E43m for Mondi's corrugating plants in the UK which generated EBITDA of just over E8m last year, implying

a relatively attractive 5 times multiple. These assets made pre-tax profits of E2m. Shares in SKG gained 7c to 
E6.87. CRH was also a big gainer, with the stock up 19c to E19.84.

The Dublin shares market made strong gains today with banks and Glanbia leading the pack while CRH also 
helped lift the index.
The ISEQ rose 43.16 points to 3,370.38.
Shares in AIB rose 5c to E1.60 after US regional bank, M and T reported a first quarter diluted earnings per share 
of USD1.15, an impressive increase of 135pc year-on-year and 11pc on the linked quarter. The result was also 
ahead of consensus expectations of 99c as the bank reported stable operating profit quarter-on-quarter, but credit

offsetting a decline of USD120m of average interest earning assets in the quarter. AIB owns over 20pc of the bank 
and has said it is seeking a buyer for the shareholding to bolster its balance sheet at home.
Shares in Bank of Ireland climbed 10c to E1.85 and Irish Life and Permanent jumped 11c to E3.48. Latest reports 
indicate that draft figures circulated to insurance companies show new business was up 4pc in the first three 
months of this year. It appears the survey shows regular premiums up 123pc whilst annual premiums are down 1pc. 
These figures compare to Goodbody's estimate of flat sales at Irish Life and Permanent for the current year (retail 
+5pc and pensions -5pc). "Should the first quarter figures be sustained, there could be helpful margin implications 
for the life assurer, where we already have margins bounce 150bps to 13.0pc on cost takeout," said analyst, 
Eamonn Hughes. Shares in FBD rose 10c to E7.70. Elsewhere, shares in food group, Glanbia, surged by 25c to

ahead of consensus expectations of 99c as the bank reported stable operating profit quarter-on-quarter, but credit 
losses showed a marked deterioration, falling 28pc. Net interest income of USD546m was in line with the fourth 
quarter (USD565m) as the bank continued to widen its net interest margin, by 7bps in the quarter to 3.78pc, 
offsetting a decline of USD120m of average interest earning assets in the quarter. AIB owns over 20pc of the bank

Tim Ash at Royal Bank of Scotland said: "Media attention is increasingly turning to the economic costs, which

"Talk of the need for government bail-outs for airlines will surely just add to concerns over the state of public 
finances in Europe."
Eurotunnel , the operator of the Channel Tunnel, was one of the winners on the FTSE Eurofirst, up 3.5 per cent to

Officials admit flaws in flight ban as new cloud threatens reopening of skies

Fresh uncertainty over the resumption of flights at UK airports emerged last night after warnings that a new ash 
cloud was spreading towards Britain.
The move came hours after authorities across Europe agreed to ease the no-fly zone that has paralysed continental 
airports since last Thursday.
Earlier, officials acknow-ledged flaws in computer models that led to the most sweeping airspace closures since the 
second world war.
Amid mounting pressure from airlines, which have been losing an estimated $200m (£130m) a day in revenue, 
European Union transport ministers said they planned to start opening air corridors to bring home some of the 
hundreds of thousands of people stranded by the disruption that followed last week's eruption at the Eyjafjallajökull 
volcano in Iceland.
However, last night a Met Office spokesman said the eruptions had intensified. "This just shows how much we are 
at the mercy of the volcano," he said.
National Air Traffic Services, said Scottish airports should still open from 7am today and airspace over England may 
become available from 1pm, "although not as far south as the main London airports".
British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and other UK airlines said they intended to resume some flights today after ministers 
reached a deal to cut the size of the no-fly zone that has affected nearly 7m people worldwide.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he hoped to resume flights from about lunchtime tomorrow and 
estimated the backlog of flights would clear in "a day or two".
Plans for the reopening came after the UK deployed the Royal Navy to rescue stranded passengers and the chief 
executives of eight airlines wrote to the government to warn the situation had become "untenable" and "could have 
a material impact on our financial positions".
Officials admit flaws in flight ban as new cloud threatens reopening of skies
They said: "We believe the nature of this natural disaster presents a clear case for government compensation."
The letter came as officials in Brussels said many of the estimated 82,000 European flights grounded by air traffic 
authorities would have gone ahead under US aviation standards.
"The science behind the model we're running at the moment is based on certain assumptions where we do not 
have clear scientific evidence. It is a black box in certain areas," said Matthias Ruete, the European Commission's 
director-general for mobility and transport.
Mr Ruete said authorities were unsure what density of ash was hazardous for aircraft engines. Early results of 40 or 
so test flights conducted over the weekend by European airlines suggested risks were less than the computer 
models indicated.
The admission is likely to bolster critics, who accused authorities of excessive caution.

worldwide. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said he hoped to resume flights from around lunchtime 
tomorrow and estimated the backlog of flights would clear in "a day or two".
The long-awaited re-opening came after the UK deployed the Royal Navy to rescue stranded passengers and the 
chief executives of eight airlines wrote to the government to warn that the situation had become "untenable" and 
was "now reaching levels that could have a material impact on our financial positions". They said: "We believe the 
nature of this natural disaster presents a clear case for government compensation."
The letter came as officials in Brussels said many of the estimated 82,000 European flights grounded by national air 
traffic authorities would have gone ahead under US aviation standards and urged these principles to be considered 
in future.
"The science behind the model we're running at the moment is based on certain assumptions where we do not

Giovanni Bisignani, head of the International Air Transport Association, said Europe had a "unique system" for 
dealing with volcano eruptions based on a theoretical model for how far ash spreads. "The chaos, inconvenience 
and economic losses are not theoretical. They are enormous." he said. "We must make decisions based on the real 
situation in the sky, not on theoretical models."

Unprecedented is a big word. But it may now be an appropriate description for the airline industry chaos resulting 
from the volcanic ash cloud over Europe. The disruption is worse than after 9/11. And it is affecting a business that 
is barely profitable in the best years, making a net profit globally in only two of the years from 2001 to 2010. IATA, 
the industry body, forecasts a global industry loss of $2.8bn this year; it estimates airspace closures have cost 
airlines $200m a day.
European airlines hit hardest by the problems will face sizeable revenue losses from cancelled flights, only partially 
offset by fuel and other cost savings. Some remaining operating losses will be recouped once airspace reopens. 
But airlines will also face hefty costs for accommodating and rerouting many passengers. Even if not obliged to pay 
for hotels, they will do so in many cases to protect reputations for customer service.
The impact will be greatest for the European flag carriers, with the largest proportion of their schedules cancelled 
and the highest service cost burden. Low-cost carriers EasyJet and Ryanair both have more routes that are as yet 
outside the airspace closure zone. And thanks to their no-frills ethos and lack of long-haul connecting passengers, 
their hotel costs should be lower. Hence, while estimates of daily losses for British Airways, Air France-KLM and 
Lufthansa run into tens of millions of euros, they are in the low single-digits for the low-cost fliers. For US airlines 
the financial impact may be limited, as only 14 per cent of US capacity was dedicated to European transatlantic 
travel in 2009, says CreditSights.
The market, notes Nomura, seems to be pricing in disruption to European airlines lasting into next week; with some 
airspace reopening today, that may prove an over-reaction. The greatest unknown, however, is whether further 
Icelandic eruptions could mean disturbances recurring over a long period. If so, the impact on airlines - and the 
broader economy - could become much more severe.

The well-connected Kyran McLaughlin , who is stepping down as chairman of Elan, feels it is time to pass on the 
baton at the Ireland-based drugs group.
After five years in the post, Mr McLaughlin's departure comes as the company launches a review. He is also a 
director of Ryanair as well as vice-chairman at Irish stockbrokers Davy, where he has been head of equities since 
the 1980s.
Mr McLaughlin is an investor in the consortium that bought London's Savoy hotel in 2004 and led a EUR340m

Markets were under pressure this morning following residual concerns over fraud charges against Goldman Sachs 
and concern over wider scrutiny of investment banks while Irish airline shares were hit by the grounding of Europe's 
aircraft.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen 37.34 points to 3,300.35.
The US-basedbank, which was charged with fraud on Friday by the US Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC), for structuring and marketing of a debt product tied to sub-prime mortgages, is set to face increased 
pressure with both the UK and German governments indicating over the weekend that they too may carry out their 
own investigations. In recent months, bank stocks have rallied while investor concerns regarding over-regulation of

additional deals to be announced in the coming months, ahead of the market opening up in June (for example, 
earlier in the month, Ladbrokes announced a deal with CANAL+).

The Jurys Inns Group has rebranded to position itself more squarely as a service-oriented chain of hotels.
A new brand identity and a new tagline - Exceptional Everyday City Hotels - is designed to help set the hotels more 
apart from their many competitors in the middle market.
The company's website has been redesigned to reflect the new logo and give it a more streamlined look and feel.
Staff are also being retrained to emphasise the importance of good service, and a £9 million upgrade of the older 
hotels, including several in Ireland, is under way.
Sales and marketing director Gill Harris said friendly service had always been a big priority for the group, but the 
point was now being made more explicitly across all communications, particularly online.
The target customer group was very wide, she said.
Jurys Inns attract mainly businesspeople on weekdays, but at weekends host a mix that includes older people on 
sightseeing city breaks and groups of friends travelling together.
''If I had to pick a brand we'd like to emulate, it would probably be John Lewis," said Harris, citing the Br i t i sh 
department store chain. ''Very definitely not Ryanair."
While Jurys Inns are technically classified as three-star, the group is pointing to its credentials in its four-star 
facilities, city centre locations, large welcoming reception areas, a separate bar and restaurant and a strong online 
presence.
Harris said the service claims were supported by customer satisfaction levels of between 80 and 90 per cent, as 
measured by value-for-money (82 per cent), intention to return (81 per cent) and staff friendliness (88 per cent).
Jurys Inn rebrands and upgrades its service
The Jurys Inns group now has 30 hotels: 23 in Britain, six in Ireland and one in Prague. It opened seven new outlets 
last year.
Harris said the company still had its eye on expansion, particularly in promising markets such as London.
New hotels are scheduled to open in Bradford and Portsmouth this year and in Gateshead and Glasgow in 2011. In 
addition, the group plans to expand its Islington hotel with 150 new rooms to meet demand at the hotel which 
currently runs at 90 per cent occupancy.
''It's been a very difficult period for everyone in hotels, but we're glad to see that we've outperformed in the market 
in 2009." said Harris.
She said British business was starting to pick up this year in some areas, including London and Edinburgh. Ireland, 
she said, would lag behind.

McConnells buyout heralds end of era in Irish advertising
McConnells buyout heralds end of era in Irish advertising
Sunday Business Post

'It's very, very sad," was the comment from one senior advertising figure, following the news that advertising agency 
DDFH&B was poised to buy McConnells integrated.
While DDFH&B plans to preserve the McConnells brand, the deal still means the end of the road for the company 
that helped create iconic Irish brands like Ryanair and Ballygowan, at least in its current form.
The deal was hammered out in the early hours of Friday morning and McConnells staff were informed of the 
change of ownership via an e-mail from Pat Donnelly. He is expected to be confirmed as their new managing 
director.
Advertising executives and marketing managers, particularly those over the age of 40, have a deep nostalgia for the 
McConnells name, which has been in the market since 1916.
For decades, McConnells flew the flag for the independent Irish-owned agency, which became an increasing rarity 
in a market dominated by global players. It was the only agency name that the broader public knew.
''There's really only one agency that's ever approached being a household name in Ireland and McConnells is it," 
said another senior marketing person.
''I am sure there is a strong vision for what happens next but the old version of McConnells looks like it's dead and 
buried."
The takeover move by DDFH&B has been described by those close to the negotiations as ''opportunistic'' rather 
than strategic.
There were tentative discussions between the two agencies about an investment by DDFH&B in McConnells 
several months ago, but they came to nothing.
McConnells buyout heralds end of era in Irish advertising
There are conflicting reports about how the latest talks arose. So me informed sources said it resulted from an 
approach ten days ago to DDFH&B by McConnells integrated.
Others say that Donnelly, who is taking over at the helm of McConnells having joined as head of McConnells' media 
wing MCM a month ago, started negotiations.
Rumours of difficulties at McConnells integrated have been circulating for months.
Like many large advertising agencies, the firm had been forced into job cuts by the economic downturn - but, in its 
particular case, there has also been a severe haemorrhage of senior executives.
Unlike many agencies, McConnells changed hands at the top of the market two years ago, when Stuart Fogarty 
paid a rumoured  15 million for it, outbidding other parties, including DDFH&B.
Five McConnells directors subsequently left and set up boutique agency Boys and Girls.
It's thought between 50 and 60 people are employed by McConnells, including a long established creative team. 
DDFH&B has 118 staff, while its direct marketing division, RMG Target, has 65. MCM has lost big accounts like 
Tesco (though McConnells still has the creative business).
AIB, a key long-standing client of MCM, put its media account up for review, adding to pressure on the business. 
Another client, the IDA, is also reviewing its media account.
In accounts signed off two months ago for McConnells and MCM, the company auditors drew attention to 
''negotiations currently in progress with the group and its financial providers''.
The 2008 accounts for McConnells Advertising showed that turnover fell from  40 million to  36 million and profits 
were down from 4million to  1.3million.
MCM's accounts say revenue was  35 million in 2008, down from  44million.Profits were  73,000 compared with 
almost  1 million the previous year.
In recent weeks, McConnells staff were told on two occasions that a buyer was interested in the business, 
according to informed sources.
It's understood that staff learned the latest news from industry website Adworld, which broke the story in advance of 
a deal being struck.
DDFH&B will retain the iconic brand, operating McConnells and MCM in their existing premises under new 
management. The new name McConnells integrated will be dropped. The new owners will not take on the debts of 
McConnells, leaving creditors in an uncertain position.
A coincidence in this deal is the relationship between Jim Donnelly, the co-founder and chairman of DDFH&B, and 
his brother Pat, who runs MCM. Before then, Pat Donnelly was running CoreMedia, an alliance between Publicis 
QMP's media buying wing and MCM, which RTE refused to recognise until MCM pulled out.
Pat Donnelly is a heavy hitter in media buying. His position at the helm of McConnells is an interesting industry 
development, in part reversing the trend to operate media separately from creative advertising.
The dramatic news broke a mere 24 hours before AIB's advertising team was due to hear a pitch from MCM last 
Thursday for a media account that has been with McConnells for about 20 years.
It is understood that AIB ''sought clarity'' from MCM about its future prospects during that meeting and went ahead 
to hear a pitch from rival agency Vizeum last Friday. A decision is expected by the end of April.
The AIB account is core to MCM, and would have been worth as much as  10 million at its height. This year, the 
bank is expected to spend  3million on advertising.
McConnells buyout heralds end of era in Irish advertising
Industry executives said they believed errors were made when McConnells was sold in 2008 to AFA O'Meara, 
whose owner and managing director Stuart Fogarty outbid DDFH&B and others.
The deal resulted in the entire AFA O'Meara team moving in with the McConnells staff to create a merged entity.
''I don't think small buying big really works," said one executive close to the situation. ''That was a brave move by 
Stuart Fogarty," said Michael Cullen, editor of Marketing magazine.
''He called it a merger but everyone knew this was a reverse takeover. He decided to keep the McConnells brand 
name and that meant the end of the AFA O'Meara brand name, which again was a very brave thing to do [AFA was 
founded by and named after Stuart's father, the advertising legend Aubrey Fogarty]."
However, Cullen added, there were plenty of people who felt Fogarty should have dropped the McConnells name at 
that point and forged a new identity for the merged company.
''Some people said this smacked of trading on sentiment. T he McConnells name is a big deal for some people but 
it really doesn't mean a great deal any more to young people in the industry."
Orlaith Blaney, head of McCann Erickson Ireland, said: ''The demise of the McConnells business is very sad for the 
advertising business.
I t was Irish-owned and John Fanning [McConnells' former chairman] in his day was, and still is, a superb and 
intelligent brand champion for Ireland.
''The talent pool at McConnells in my early days in advertising was both admired and respected. The ravages of 
globalisation have hit hard as global brands consolidate their business. We all know too well, in this business, that 
you cannot control these international decisions."
''The AFA purchase of McConnells was certainly a very ambitious and brave decision. I remember reading the 
launch ads for the combined entity and thinking that the revenue and volume they had would leave them in very 
good shape.
''Having worked at Dimension in my early days, which was owned by McConnells, and now working for IPG, an 
international network, the upsides are really significant in terms of access to global trends, insights, resource and 
real-time knowledge and marketing intelligence.
''You simply must have this in business these days to really thrive and grow."
After the departure of most of McConnells senior directors, including head of advertising Fiona Scott, Fogarty 
established a new management team for the agency and changed its name to McConnells integrated, to reflect 
increasing focus on newer strands of the business, such as digital.
He brought in former journalist and digital media specialist Richard Delevan to run the digital end of the business.
Fogarty - who is thought to have paid in the region of  15 million for McConnells - said he was determined to make 
the business work.
He stood by his decision to retain the McConnells brand, telling The Sunday Business Post at the time: 
''McConnells is the strongest brand in Irish marketing. It's a bit like the Blackrock College rugby team: everyone 
hates them, but everyone wants to play for them."
Fogarty said in November last year that the advertising market remained very tough, but he was confident things 
would not get any worse. Earlier this month, he also insisted all was well.
''Our bankers are extremely supportive and always have been," he said. He pointed out that the company had been 
profitable in 2008, despite the difficult trading environment.
McConnells buyout heralds end of era in Irish advertising
The rest of this notoriously gossip-fuelled industry is watching with interest and some sympathy.
Fogarty is a popular figure and his reputation for being a vocal defender of advertising as an industry is widely 
appreciated.
Pat and Jim Donnelly are also well regarded and it's believed that they will make a good job of salvaging the 
McConnells business.
But some downplayed the significance of the news.' 'It's not the first time something like this has happened - Arks 
has come and gone, the Hunters brand is gone," said one executive.' 'It's not really all that unusual."

Highlight: Disruptions could continue next week
Body
Airline stocks tumbled yesterday as travel chaos caused by a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland worsened in northern 
Europe and officials warned the disruption could continue into next week.
Some 16,000 flights were estimated to have been lost yesterday, the Eurocontrol air traffic agency said, or nearly 
60 per cent of the normal daily number, as a dozen countries restricted airspace in case tiny ash particles choked 
aircraft engines. As the cloud drifted, some airports re-opened in Scotland and in Ireland, where the Ryanair budget 
airline said it was cancelling flights to more than 12 destinations in northern Europe until 1pm on Monday. But other 
airports gradually shut, spurring some analysts to suggest the loss of airline revenues could reach as much as $1bn 
(£649m).
Passengers scrambled to find alternative transport by bus, boat or the heavily booked Eurostar. One UK-based 
private jet broker claimed to have received an offer of £100,000 for any aircraft that was willing to break the 
airspace ban to fly corporate lawyers from London to France for a business deal.
In the UK, where restrictions remain in place until at least 1pm today, a Met Office spokesman said that forecast 
winds over the next two days suggested a renewed risk of more ash drifting across the country if Iceland's 
Eyjafjallajökull volcano kept erupting.
British Airways said all its flights to and from London airports were cancelled today.
Shares in the region's largest carriers, including BA, Germany's Lufthansa andAir France-KLM fell more than 3 per 
cent.
The family of Lech Kaczynski, the late Polish president, said that it wanted his funeral to proceed as planned, even 
though the disrupted air travel across Europe was keeping world leaders such as US President Barack Obama 
away, news agencies reported.
European airline shares fall as volcanic ash deepens travel chaos
As the disruption worsened, Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, the secretary-general of the Association of European Airlines, 
questioned the way the authorities were implementing flight restrictions. "We are concerned that different criteria 
may be applied by different authorities to determine if and when their airspace will be closed, and equally 
importantly, reopened for aircraft," he said.

Highlight: Financial fallout
Body
Airline stocks tumbled yesterday, prompting concern about the financial effects of the cloud of volcanic ash that has 
turned large parts of northern Europe into a no-fly zone.
Large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip as airport closures spread across the continent for 
a second day, affecting nearly 60 per cent of the region's 28,000 daily flights, according to the Eurocontrol air traffic 
agency in Brussels.
In the UK, where authorities were among the first to impose airspace bans, British Airways shares closed down 
more than 3 per cent, while in Ireland budget airline Ryanair was down 2.3 per cent.
Europe's largest airline by revenue, Lufthansa, closed down 4 per cent, while Air France-KLM fell 3.4 per cent. In 
the US, the parents of American Airlines and United Airlines were down 3.4 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.
With weather forecasters predicting winds were likely to push the volcanic cloud farther over Europe in coming 
days, some analysts began issuing ever gloomier estimates of the cost of the disruption.
"The lost traffic revenue for airlines as a result of a complete shutdown in UK flights is likely in excess of £200m per 
day if all revenue was refundable," said Ashley Steel at KPMG.
However, many analysts cautioned it was too early to predict the eventual cost of the disruption, and pointed out 
that snowfalls that grounded airline fleets over winter did not end up costing carriers heavily.
"In January, snow caused multi-day groundings which ultimately had a minimum effect on airline profitability," said 
Joe Gill, an analyst at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin.
"Every day of zero flying takes on average about 0.25 per cent off an airline's annual sales although seasonality 
skews this considerably. This is happening at a time when fares are a touch weaker. If this was Easter week or the 
peak of July the problem would be much greater."
Airline stocks lose altitude as ash trail hits revenue
At least one aviation research group questioned whether European officials' reaction to the volcanic ash cloud was 
overly cautious.
"You have to defer to authorities," said David Bentley, European associate of the Sydney-based Centre for Asia 
Pacific Aviation, adding a "health and safety culture" might have prompted the dramatic response to the ash cloud.
Others disagreed. "I've just been talking to pilots who say the ash could be 5ft or 55,000ft up, you don't know," said 
John Strickland, an aviation consultant. "They said it might look like blue skies but the stuff is there and there's 
documented evidence of what it can do."
This was a reference to two incidents in the 1980s when British Airways and KLM jets suffered engine failure after 
flying through volcanic dust.

European shares extended falls in afternoon trade yesterday as the US Securities and Exchange Commission 
charged Goldman Sachs with fraud, putting pressure on banking stocks.
By close  Deutsche Bank  lost 7.3 per cent to EUR55.99, Crédit Agricole  in France fell 3.5 per cent to EUR13.30 
and Banco Santander in Spain weakened 2.8 per cent to EUR10.49. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 1.5 per cent to 
1,095.30, down 0.6 per cent for the week.
A stronger industrial sector failed to offset losses from airlines after a huge ash cloud from an Icelandic volcano 
caused air travel chaos for a second day.
Around 17,000 flights were cancelled across Europe yesterday because of the dangers posed by the ash for 
aircraft.
Carriers' shares fell as airports across Europe were expected to stay closed until at least today.
Lufthansa in Germany fell 4.1 per cent to EUR12.74, Air France-KLM lost 3.4 per cent to EUR12.44, Air Berlin  
dipped 2.5 per cent to EUR4.22,  Iberia in Spain weakened 3.4 per cent to EUR2.57 and Ireland's Ryanair declined 
2.5 per cent to EUR3.89.
Sweden's SKF , the world's biggest bearings maker, leapt 5.8 per cent to SKr141.60 yesterday after the company 
announced better-than-forecast earnings ahead of schedule.
Fredric Stahl at UBS said SKF's earnings forecasts would have a positive impact on European industrials. Swedish 
engineering group Sandvik gained 4.7 per cent to SKr100.80 while Atlas Copco advanced 1.3 per cent to 
SKr118.40. Rival Trelleborg rallied 6.5 per cent to SKr53.50.
Telenor , the Norwegian telecoms group, rose after it said it was very close to securing a deal with Russia's Alfa

Volcano could build into major business problem

The eruption of a volcano in the tiny, isolated island nation of Iceland is threatening to turn into a major headache 
for businesses across Europe and around the world as a spreading ash cloud closes more European airports.
Airlines are already counting the cost of grounded planes, and there are growing fears about the transportation of 
food supplies and other essential goods should the flight disruptions persist for several days or longer.
But there were also some early winners from the unprecedented situation, with rail, bus and ferry tour operators all 
quick to lay on extra services for stranded business and leisure travelers as hotel rooms filled up.
Airline shares took a hit as the Geneva-based International Air Transport Association estimated that the disruption 
is costing the industry some $200 million a day in revenues. IATA added its forecast was "conservative" and costs 
will mount further as carriers reroute aircraft and care for stranded passengers.
Eurocontrol, the European air traffic agency, said some 16,000 flights were canceled on Friday, more than half the 
28,000 that usually operate. Delays and cancelations will continue on Saturday as the ash cloud from the eruption 
of the volcano beneath Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull (ay-yah-FYAH'-plah-yer-kuh-duhl) glacier moves south and east. 
The flight ban was imposed because of concerns about pilot visibility and jet engine failure from the ash.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, the leading low-cost airline in Europe, said it was extending the cancelations across most of 
its network through to at least lunchtime on Monday to give passengers clarity about the situation and a chance to 
rebook flights.
"This spreading cloud of volcanic ash is an unprecedented event in Ryanair's 26 year history, and we are continuing 
to work around the clock to minimise its effects on our schedules," said Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary.
Ashley Steel, global chairman for transport and infrastructure at professional services company KPMG, said that the 
biggest losses would come from trans-Atlantic business traffic, with the impact on economy class revenues muted 
by the fact that people would likely change their bookings to a later date.
Volcano could build into major business problem
"This is yet another dramatic and costly event for the global aviation industry which will have a significant impact on 
annual revenues," Steel said, adding that the development reinforced the case for consolidation of the international 
airline sector.
"Truly global airlines will be much better placed to deal with the financial fallout from these types of events," he said.
British Airways shares dropped 1.1 percent, German flag carrier Lufthansa lost 2.1 percent and Air France-KLM 
slipped 1.7 percent.
There were few early reports of major impacts on exports and imports, but analysts stressed that the stakes would 
rise each day of the flight ban.
"Some businesses will be affected by the inability for freight to get in and out of the country," said Howard Archer, 
chief economist at IHS Global Insight in London. "As long as the disruption is not too long, this should not be a 
major problem. The main problem will be for goods that are perishable."
The pharmaceutical industry is particularly reliant on air freight because of the high value and low weight of their 
products.
The Italian farmer's association said that it may become an issue to import out of season goods from other areas, 
even though Italian airports are still open as shipments often come via other major European cities.
Chiara Coffele, export manager of the family Coffele winery in Soave, Italy, was unsure whether she would make a 
wine festival and other business appointments in Norway in the coming days after her flight from Milan was 
canceled on Thursday.
Coffele travels two or three times a year to Norway, where the family sells 15 percent of the 510,000 bottles of wine 
it produces annually. The three-day Stavanger wine festival is usually a key network event.
While others are missing some holiday time because of the flight cancelations, "I get a little less work," Coffele said.
A spokesman for the flower market in Berlin, which sells flowers that have been imported from all over the world, 
said there had not been any problems with the delivery on Friday morning and he was not aware of logistical 
problems for Saturday's flower trade. Several sushi restaurants said they get fresh fish on Thursday and had no 
deliveries until Monday.
As Europe's airports emptied, travelers instead crowded train stations, bus depots and rental car offices.
The high-speed Eurostar rail service linking Britain and continental Europe reported thousands of new bookings for 
the next few days.
National railway operator Deutsche Bahn said it deployed all available trains and asked personnel to work extra 
shifts on the weekend. Nonetheless, it warned of overcrowded trains and long lines at booking counters. Norway's 
NSB railway company put extra trains on routes from Oslo to major Norwegian cities and the Swedish capital, 
Stockholm.
Germany's Sixt car rental reported long lines at German branches.
"There's a rush on our rental offices," said spokesman Frank Elsner. "We're trying to mobilize everything we can 
and try to offer an additional 2,000 cars across Europe in cooperation with our partners to make sure travelers can 
get back home on the weekend."
In Britain, Network Rail canceled the bulk of engineering work that was planned for the next few days and also 
added extra services.
Volcano could build into major business problem
At the Jumbo Hostel a Boeing 747 remodeled into a 27-room hotel just outside the Arlanda airport in Stockholm 
rooms were filling up fast.
"I think we'll be full tonight," said manager Oscar Dios. "It's this sort of thing that we're here for. There is no place to 
go at the airport."

Ash makes Ryanair cancel most flights until Monday

Budget airline Ryanair announced it has canceled most of its flights through midday Monday because of the 
uncertain path of Iceland's dangerous plumes of volcanic ash.
Friday's cancelation announcement is the biggest yet by any airline since the mass grounding of flights began a day 
before, spreading from Britain through much of northern Europe.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair was canceling all of its flights to and from Britain, Ireland, Belgium, 
Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, northern France, northern Germany, Poland and the Baltic 
states until 1200GMT Monday.
"Sometimes God, I'm afraid, is to blame," O'Leary said in a telephone interview.
He noted that normally the Gulf Stream and prevailing Atlantic winds from the southwest "would blow this volcanic 
ash north over the North Pole." Instead, the winds pushed the ash straight into Ryanair's No. 1 base of operations, 
Britain, while forecasts suggest the ash "is going to spread back over (No. 2 base) Ireland sometime tomorrow and 
into Sunday."
When asked how much income this massive lost business would cost Europe's most profitable airline, O'Leary 
demurred.
"We've never dealt before with cancellations on these unprecedented scales. We'll count the cost later," he said.
O'Leary forecast that Ryanair might start rebooking thwarted passengers on to flights Monday evening or Tuesday, 
but even that would require the ash threat to disperse.
Flying into the ash, he said, "would do untold damage. It would be effectively sandblasting a plane, and it's even 
more dangerous than that."
Ash makes Ryanair cancel most flights until Monday
He said Ryanair had covered 130 aircraft at its two biggest hubs, London's Stansted and Dublin, with plastic 
sheeting "to make sure that all of this dust, wherever it falls, none of it gets into the engines, tails or wings of our 
aircraft."
O'Leary said Ryanair's booking system was getting overwhelmed with short-term bookings and cancellations, 
necessitating a longer period for grounding flights. Too many thwarted passengers since Thursday have been trying 
to rebook on next-day flights, "only to find that those rebooked flights are then canceled," he said.
Ryanair's services confined to southern and central Europe are operating normally.
Ireland's other major airline, Aer Lingus, announced it was canceling all of its European flights through midday 
Saturday but its transatlantic services to several U.S. cities would continue. The volcanic ash has yet to appear 
west of Ireland.

Overnight shipping, airlines and tourism were just some of the businesses that faced a second day of disruptions as 
a cloud of volcanic ash emanating from Iceland grounded thousands of flights to and from Europe.
The airline industry is losing an estimated $200 million a day and delays and cancellations are expected to last at 
least through the weekend. The impact on businesses that depend on air freight to ship products to and from 
Europe was harder to quantify, but the world's two largest package delivery companies were seeing a growing 
backlog.
Both UPS and FedEx had their main European air hubs closed down by the cloud of ash. Shipments that are 
normally transported by air were being delayed by at least a day, according to UPS spokesman Norman Black. 
Both companies are taking actions that indicate they're worried about falling further behind.
On Friday afternoon, FedEx stopped accepting virtually all its lower-priority international shipments, which can 
include a wide variety of products from auto parts to clothing, in order to "control any backlog that might occur within 
the system," spokeswoman Sally Davenport said.
UPS planned to have workers move packages over the weekend a time when they don't usually ship to catch up. 
Within Europe, both FedEx and UPS are moving packages by truck instead of air when possible.
"Some businesses will be affected by the inability for freight to get in and out of the country," said Howard Archer, 
chief European and U.K economist at IHS Global Insight in London. "As long as the disruption is not too long, this 
should not be a major problem."
Many businesses that rely heavily on air freight because they ship products of high value and small size expressed 
confidence that current stockpiles would suffice. A spokeswoman for London-based GlaxoSmithKline, the world's 
fourth largest drug maker by sales, said the company has enough inventory to meet demand until European flights 
resume.
Impact of volcanic ash surfacing for US businesses
For now, the most obvious impact is on air travel. At least one airline, Ryanair Holdings PLC, the leading low-cost 
airline in Europe, has canceled flights through Monday.
Eurocontrol said about 16,000 of Europe's usual 28,000 daily flights were canceled Friday twice as many as were 
canceled a day earlier.
Flight cancelations can have a cascading effect because if a plane is grounded in Europe, it can't get to the United 
States for a return trip the next day, even if the European airspace is open.
The Air Transport Association says U.S. passenger airlines and cargo carriers cancelled 280 of the more than 330 
trans-Atlantic flights on Friday.
Grant Foster, risk consultant for insurance broker Aon Corp., based in Chicago. said issues with travel and products 
getting delivered "are going to get quite critical over the next couple of days."
But, he added: "As a whole, the impact isn't a show-stopper in the short term."
Sara Johnson, managing director of global macroeconomics at IHS Global Insight, predicts little fallout to the global 
economy.
"It's just an unfortunate episode that will cause inconvenience but certainly will not derail the global economic 
recovery," she says.
Not everyone is crying foul over the plume of smoke. The aviation disruption has been a boon to train and bus 
service in Europe.
And thousands of stranded business travelers need temporary offices and virtual conferencing capabilities. Regus, 
a company that provides meeting rooms and virtual offices worldwide, said it has seen an unprecedented spike in 
the use of its more than 2,500 video communication suites. Reservations are up 38 percent in the UK, 12 percent 
across Europe and 9 percent in the U.S.
Hotels and inns have also held up well as stranded travelers find a place to wait it out.
Rachael Solem, owner of the Irving House at Harvard and Harding House in Cambridge, Mass., has had some 
cancellations. But a few guests had to stay longer because flights weren't available to Europe.
One guest originally bound for Heathrow returned to stay an extra two days.
"She is visiting a new grandchild, so she has not been too upset over having to extend her visit here," Solem said.
AP writers Jane Wardell in London, Jeannine Aversa and Matthew Perrone in Washington and David Koenig in 
Dallas contributed to this report.

Tens of thousands of Irish air travellers face a continuing wave of cancellations today as a result of the volcanic ash 
cloud hanging over northern Europe.
Part of Ireland's air space will stay closed this morning until at least 11am, when the Irish Aviation Authority is due 
to make a new ruling.
The authority says it will be guided in its decision by concern for the safety of the pilots, crews and passengers.
The two main airlines at Dublin - Aer Lingus and Ryanair - have both cancelled all flights to the UK and the 
continent until 1pm. A TUI flight to Tenerife is, however, expected to depart, as is an Aer Arann flight to Donegal. 
Five US-bound Aer Lingus flights to New York, Chicago and Boston are due to operate from Dublin, though with 
delays. The Irish Aviation Authority last night lifted restrictions on flights to and from airports at Cork and Shannon 
and some of the regional airports. Aer Lingus says, however, that its EI 111 flight today from Shannon to New York 
has been cancelled. The huge plume of volcanic ash from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland is continuing to 
hang over much of northern Europe at a height of between 4-7 kilometres. Most of Britain's air space will remain 
closed to all but emergency flights today until at least 7pm this evening because of dangers posed by the ash cloud. 
Some flights from Northern Ireland and the Western Isles of Scotland to and from Glasgow, Edinburgh and 
Prestwick are, however, expected to be allowed to fly up to 1pm today, the National Air Traffic Services said in a 
statement.

The sky is clear. Why is my flight cancelled?   Volcanic ash consists of tiny, hard particles that cannot be picked 
up by aircraft weather radars but can have a catastrophic impact on aircraft engines, where they melt and coat vital 
parts so the engines shut down. They can also sandblast windscreens, restriciting pilots' view.
Experts say no aircraft have been lost as a result of a volcanic eruption, though there have been a number of near 
misses. One of the best known happened in 1982 when a British Airport jumbo jet flew through a volcanic cloud 
caused by an eruption in Indonesia and lost power in all four engines. Pilots descended and landed safely after they 
were able to restart the engines. As engines cool, the volcanic material solidifies and can break away enough to 
restore airflow.    How long will the disruption last?   It depends on how quickly the volcanic cloud disperses and 
that depends on the weather.
UK airports are expected to be closed until at least 1pm today and Nats, the air traffic control agency, says "it is 
very unlikely that the situation over England will improve in the foreseeable future". Even if the cloud cleared, the 
knock-on effect of thousands of cancelled flights across Europe will take some time to clear.
   Can I get a refund if my flight is cancelled?   Check on your airline's website but the answer is likely to be yes. 
British Airways is offering a full refund or a free re-booking, as long as the change is made within two weeks. 
EasyJet is also offering a refund, or a free transfer to another flight on the same route within 30 days of the original 
flight date. Ryanair is also offering a full refund on cancelled flights, which it says will be processed in 10 working 
days, or a free re-booking.
   What should I do if I have a ticket to fly at the weekend?   At this stage it is impossible to know. Keep 
checking your airline's website. It is where they are putting up the most up-to-date news on the situation.

The chaos caused at Ireland and Europe's airports by the cloud of ash from the Icelandic volcano sent Aer Lingus 
and Ryanair shares markedly lower, helping to break a five-day winning streak on the ISEQ.
The ISEQ fell 13.51 points to 3,342.18.
A rally in world shares sparked by a resilient and fast growing China helped keep the losses at a minimum.
But airline stocks fell sharply as airports closed after a giant plume of ash drifted over Norther Europe. Dublin 
Airport will be closed until at least 6am this morning but the closure there - and elsewhere in Ireland and the rest of 
Europe - could be worse. Shares in Aer Lingus fell 2c to E0.73 while Ryanair lost 7c to E4.00. In an appearance 
before an Oireachtas committee this week, the Financial Regulator indicated that it was unlikely that the banks 
would require further capital injections. This follows the stated amounts - including E2.7bn for Bank of Ireland and 
E7.4bn for Allied Irish Banks - outlined last month that banks must raise in order to satisfy the Regulator's stress 
tests. The Regulator noted that the stress tests had factored in "pretty dire situations". These comments give 
comfort to the investment case for the Irish banks as investor focus has very much shifted away from capital 
concerns to the potential normalised earnings outlook for the banks. AIB gained 7c to E1.62, Bank of Ireland rose 
5c to E1.72 and Irish Life and Permanent was down 5c at E3.44. Shares in CRH dropped 13c to E18.82. The 
sudden resignation of Mairtin Clarke, the head of CRH's European Products & Distribution business, has resulted in 
a number of management changes within the organisation which demonstrates the depth of management 
resources. Erik Bax has been appointed as the new head of European Product and Distribution. He previously was 
head of European Distribution and has been with CRH since 1984. Marc St. Nicolaas will replace Erik Bax as head

(RTTNews) - Airline services across the U.K. were disrupted Thursday over fears that an &apos;ash cloud&apos; 
from an Icelandic volcano could cause engine damage thereby endangering lives of passengers, reports said.
According to the Air Traffic Control Service (Nats), t U.K&apos;s main air navigation service provider, no aircraft 
would be allowed to fly in or out of the country&apos;s airspace from Thursday noon until 0600 hours local time 
(1800 hours GMT) as a preventive measure.
"The Volcanic Ash Advisory Center has issued a forecast that the ash cloud from the volcanic eruption in Iceland 
will track over Europe tonight. Nats is working with Eurocontrol and our colleagues in Europe&apos;s other air 
navigation service providers to take the appropriate action to ensure safety in accordance with international aviation 
policy," a Nats spokesman said
The eruption in the Artic nation&apos;s Eyjafjallajoekull area, the second within a month, has thrown up ash to 
greater heights and the tiny particles of rock and even glass contained in it can play havoc with machinery. In 1982, 
a British Airways (BA) flight suffered engine failure after flying into an ash cloud.
Following a warning from UK&apos;s Met Office that the ash could clog engines, airports operator BAA said all 
flights at Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick would be suspended from midday while in Scotland, authorities have 
already shut down all airports.
The restrictions were imposed in line with the guidelines on airline safety laid down by international civil aviation 
policy and passengers were asked to contact respective airlines before deciding on air travel.
National carrier British Airways said it had cancelled all domestic flights for the whole of Thursday and passengers 
would be refunded or given the option of rebooking while budget airline Ryanair said it had grounded all its flights to 
or from the UK on Thursday.
As a result of cancellations announced by airlines, Birmingham airport warned of severe disruption of flights with 
East Midlands, Leeds Bradford, Cardiff International Bristol and Dublin also being hit.

(RTTNews) - Airline services across northern Europe were disrupted Thursday over fears that a huge cloud of ash 
from an Icelandic volcano could cause engine damage thereby endangering lives of passengers, reports said.
Authorities were closing down airspace in Britain and Denmark while flights were also severely disrupted in Norway, 
Sweden, Ireland and Finland. Flights were reportedly being canceled or airspace closed in the Netherlands, France 
and Spain.
The unsafe air traffic atmosphere left hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded.
The eruption on Wednesday under a glacier in the Artic nation&apos;s Eyjafjallajoekull area, the second within a 
month, has thrown up ash to greater heights and the tiny particles of rock and glass contained in it can play havoc 
with machinery.
The glacier meltdown caused flooding, and up to 800 people were evacuated from the area.
According to the Air Traffic Control Service (Nats), Britain&apos;s main air navigation service provider, no aircraft 
would be allowed to fly in or out of the country&apos;s airspace until 6 p.m. local time Thursday as a preventive 
measure.

A number of flights to and from Dublin to British airports have been hit by the cloud of volcanic ash that is drifting 
south from a major eruption in Iceland
Almost thirty flights departing and arriving at Dublin Airport have been affected due to the volcanic ash which can 
damage aircraft engines and reduce visibility. Flights from Cork, Shannon and Belfast have also been disrupted.
bmi flights from Dublin to London Heathrow have been cancelled until further notice. So far today two bmi flights 
from Dublin to London Heathrow have been cancelled.
Aer Lingus and Ryanair said they would be issuing a statement later this morning as large queues started to form at 
Dublin Airport check-in. Flights between Ireland, Scotland, and England have been grounded after an ash cloud 
from a volcano eruption in Iceland drifted into airspace over Scotland. "A volcanic eruption in Iceland is pumping 
clouds of volcanic ash into the atmosphere. This is being blown towards UK airspace and will cause significant 
disruption to flights departing from and arriving in the UK on Thursday 15 April 2010," bmi in Dublin said.

At Labour HQ, work never stops - despite insufferable heat, dim lights and overcrowding, says Jim Pickard
Body
As Labour gears up for its most challenging election campaign for 18 years, campaign activists describe a "Ryanair" 
feel to party headquarters in Victoria with scores of advisers crammed into extra seats in the open-plan offices.
The usual layout has been rearranged to accommodate dozens of volunteers and former special advisers no longer 
employed within Whitehall departments. Under the "brutal" schedule, work starts at dawn and many staff are still at 
their desks in the early hours.
"The lights are very dim, which is disorientating, I don't know if the idea is to make us work longer," says one person 
brought in to help with the campaign. "It feels not unlike a casino; but less fun."
Entering the first floor of the building through a lobby, there are two adjacent open-plan offices. Between them lies 
the "boardroom" used for top-level meetings such as Ed Miliband's final discussion on the completed manifesto on 
Sunday night.
Gordon Brown will spend most of the month on the road, drumming up support in constituencies. While in London 
he occupies his own office in a far corner, with another room next door for his key aides. Asked if it is true that Mr 
Brown sometimes works past 1am, one adviser says: "You'd be lucky. Sometimes it's much later. It's all about the 
Calvinist work ethic."
Of the two main offices, one is occupied by press officers, "new media" workers and analysts. The other includes 
event managers, fundraisers and regional Labour officials.
Labour officials complain about the insufferable heat. "You'd have thought that with our finances we could save a bit 
of money by turning the central heating down," says one.
At 7am the core Labour team gathers for its first meeting of the day at the central boardroom. Some are familiar 
faces from the seminal 1997 election. Lord Mandelson, sometimes seen sipping infusions of fruit tea; Lord Gould, 
'Not unlike a casino, but less fun'
formerly Tony Blair's pollster; and Alastair Campbell, former head of communications for the party. Mr Campbell is 
playing David Cameron in rehearsals for the leaders' television debates.
This has prompted wits to ascribe a Spinal Tap -type quality to the campaign, as the New Labour band reforms for 
potentially one last gig. "Everyone is mucking in," says one adviser, claiming Lord Mandelson made him a cup of 
tea on Sunday - in one of dozens of bright red New Labour mugs.
Other key figures include Douglas Alexander, international development secretary, who is the election co-ordinator, 
and business minister Pat McFadden, acting as his deputy. There are also two of Mr Brown's key political 
strategists from Number 10, David Muir and Justin Forsyth. While the manifesto was launched in a Birmingham 
hospital, the focus will from today switch back to central London.
Each morning Labour will hold a press conference at 8am. Financial constraints mean croissants, coffee and "nice 
fruit" will be the order of the day - in contrast to a more lavish offering from the Tories. The conference will be 
chaired by Lord Mandelson, Labour's most assured communicator, whose capacity for withering put-downs will be 
tested over the next three weeks. The business secretary is the chief election strategist, the central role taken by Mr 
Brown in the past three campaigns. Only rarely will he step aside for departmental heads such as Ed Balls to 
answer questions.
Lord Mandelson will also run Labour's "spin room" at Thursday's initial leaders' TV debate in Manchester. The prime 
minister himself is travelling Britain with his wife Sarah, longstanding "gatekeeper" Sue Nye and press adviser Iain 
Bundred. Ostensibly he will be meeting "real people" although last Tuesday some "well-wishers" who hailed Mr 
Brown at St Pancras station turned out to be Labour members.
Mr Brown will travel more by train and car than in previous campaigns, reflecting Labour's financial woes and a 
desire to contrast with his rival's "flashy" helicopters.

Budget airline Ryanair says aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. does not want to fulfil its request for planes with more 
seats and fewer toilets because it believes that would compromise passenger safety.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says he still hopes to convince Boeing that removing two toilets and 
adding six seats would not slow down emergency evacuations.
A Boeing spokeswoman said the company did not discuss conversations with customers.
Keen to cut costs, the airline says it also wants passengers to pay to use the toilets on its short flights within 
Europe.

Heathrow airport recorded further growth in passenger traffic last month, in spite of the strikes at British Airways 
that crimped traveller numbers.
BAA, the airports operator, said the two periods of industrial action involving BA caused an estimated net loss of 
200,000 passengers across its UK airports, with 180,000 lost at Heathrow.
Total air transport movements - the arrivals and departures of aircraft - at Heathrow fell 6.5 per cent in March as 
BAA estimated it had lost 1,400 movements to strike action. Even so, Heathrow saw 5.2m passengers travel last 
month, a 0.4 per cent increase compared with a year ago.
Without the strikes, BAA estimated it would have seen passenger numbers rise 1 per cent in March and that 
Heathrow would have recorded growth of 3.8 per cent in the same period.
BA has estimated that the strike cost it £40m-£45m as passenger numbers declined 15 per cent.
But activity at Europe's busiest airport hub picked up in the quarter amid signs that demand for travel could be 
returning as economies stabilise.
BAA said that overall traffic at Heathrow in the first three months of this year had risen 1.6 per cent to 14.6m 
passengers, with February recording the largest traffic rise in two and a half years .
But BAA also pointed to tougher economic conditions, which have prompted fewer people to make trips.
Of the airports unaffected by strikes, traffic at Stansted fell 4.2 per cent. Scottish airports were particularly affected 
by the strikes, with traffic at Glasgow down 9.6 per cent and Edinburgh down 3.3 per cent.
"There is no doubt that the market remains difficult, compounded by industrial action last month," said Colin 
Matthews, chief executive of BAA.
Heathrow sees lift in passenger traffic in spite of BA strikes
But two of its smaller airports - Southampton and the Italian city of Naples - saw passenger numbers rise 5.3 per 
cent and 5.7 per cent respectively.
In the first quarter, passenger numbers at Stansted fell 4.7 per cent to 3.9m, while they fell 9 per cent to 1.2m at 
Glasgow.
The impact of the strikes by BA cabin crew has been felt across the airline industry. BA reported some of its worst 
passenger numbers for the month of March in more than a decade, as the number of people it carried fell 15 per 
cent year on year. In contrast, the flag carrier's main low-cost rivals, EasyJet and Ryanair, saw their passenger 
numbers soar 13 per cent in March, partly thanks to the cabin crew strikes.

While it is true that a majority of takeovers add no value for shareholders - at least those of the buyer - they have a 
saving grace. They add to the gaiety of nations.
Corporate life is conducted publicly in a suffocating atmosphere of politeness. Only in the heat of a bid can bosses 
let their hair down and fire off some childish insults.
As with other areas of human activity, cultural differences loom large. Take a recent riposte to a hostile, and 
rejected, bid by US miner Peabody for an Australian rival, Macarthur. In an almost lyrical passage, a rival suitor, 
Noble, likened the target's rejection to that of a "hungry hiker who stumbles upon a roadkill roo that had been in the 
sun too long, and not surprisingly [says] no thanks".
You rarely hear this sort of thing when foreigners come bidding in the UK. The best Cadbury's chairman, Roger 
Carr, could come up with during the recent bid from Kraft was that the bidder was a "low-growth conglomerate". 
Ooh - handbags at dawn!
The US and Ireland both have a fondness for Anglo-Saxon plain-speaking. When Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus in 
2008, its boss Michael O'Leary was likened to Osama bin Laden. In turn he compared the Irish carrier to Shamrock 
Rovers, a struggling football team. PeopleSoft boss Craig Conway likened Oracle's Larry Ellison to Genghis Khan 
when the US software giant made a bid. Not a good career move. Oracle won and Mr Conway was fired. Even in 
Europe, the gloves occasionally come off - if not always with happy results. In 2006, when Germany's MAN bid for 
Swedish truckmaker Scania, the latter's boss Leif Ostling compared himself to Winston Churchill defending Britain 
from the Nazis. He later apologised.
Globalisation opens the door to new variants of the bid insult. Perhaps in the future, a Chinese chief executive will 
refer to an antagonist as a "criminal of a 1,000 generations" or "tango dancer", insults once thrown at Hong Kong 
governor Chris Patten. Bring it on.

A French court on Friday ordered low-cost airline easyJet PLC to pay (EURO)1.55 million (US$2.1 million) in 
damages and fines for employing airport workers in France on British contracts, instead of costlier French ones.
The British company was convicted for keeping 170 workers at Orly airport south of Paris on British contracts 
between 2003 and 2006.
The court in the Paris suburb of Creteil, near Orly, fined the company (EURO)150,000 and ordered it to pay a total 
of another (EURO)1.4 million to French state employment agency and other plaintiffs.
EasyJet maintains that it was adhering to French law at the time. French rules now require foreign airlines to apply 
French contracts to airport workers in France.
EasyJet immediately said it would consider appealing, and said it was "disappointed."
"We paid into the British system, and that was compliant with all the rules at the time," easyJet spokesman Oliver 
Aust told The Associated Press. "The law in France then changed."
"We are not trying to get around anything here," he said, noting that the company has switched or is switching to 
local contracts in its other European airport locations.
A lawyer for airport workers' union UNAC, Rachid Brihi, said he was "satisfied" with the ruling and said it would 
boost workers in another lawsuit against discount carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC. UNAC was set to get some of the 
money that easyJet has been ordered to pay.
EasyJet and Ryanair filed their own lawsuits in 2007 against the French government, arguing that the change in 
French rules was illegally hampering their operations and were contrary to freedom of movement around the 
European Union.
Airline easyJet fined in French labor dispute
An easyJet manager at Orly was taken into police custody briefly at the beginning of the investigation, in 2006. On 
the prosecutor's orders, labor inspectors and police and customs officers conducted a surprise check of Easyjet 
operations at Orly, Paris' second-largest airport after Roissy-Charles de Gaulle.
EasyJet currently has 500 employees in Paris and Lyon, all now on French contracts.

EasyJet passenger numbers soared in March as the low-cost carrier benefited from extra European flights and the 
fallout from the British Airways strike.
The budget airline carried 3.96m passengers in March - 13.5 per cent more than the 3.49m it carried in the same 
month last year.
That follows a 12 per cent rise in February and a 10 per cent increase in January.
The improvement at Europe's second-largest no-frills airline was in line with that of its larger rival Ryanair, which on 
Wednesday said it had carried 5.3m passengers in March, a rise of 13 per cent.
In contrast, BA on Wednesday reported some of its worst March passenger numbers in more than a decade after 
its cabin crew walked out for seven days.
The number of people that BA carried fell 15 per cent year-on-year to 2.2m, though cuts in the number of aircraft it 
flew during the winter also affected its figures.
EasyJet said that the BA strike had helped increase passenger numbers. "The strike was a contributing factor but 
most of the rise is due to our increased flights across Europe."
No-frills carriers such as Ryanair and EasyJet have gained market share in the past year as recession-hit travellers 
have shunned established legacy carriers.
The trend is likely to continue this summer with both airlines intending to increase the number of seats available by 
about 10 per cent, even as flag carriers such as BA cut capacity. But while low-cost carriers have been steadily 
increasing their share of travellers on short-haul journeys, they have yet to crack the long-haul market.
The International Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group, reported last week that the global 
airline business was slowly improving after suffering one of the worst aviation downturns in a generation during the 
global financial crisis.
EasyJet boosts traveller numbers
But in spite of the buoyant passenger numbers on no-frills airlines, the Air Transport Users Council, the aviation 
watchdog, revealed in March that EasyJet and Ryanair had been the subject of the most complaints from British 
airline passengers last year.

Highlight: BA reaches deal with Iberia on merger
US Airways resumes talks with United
Body
Airline consolidation took centre stage on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday as British Airways and Iberia reached 
agreement on their planned tie-up while US Airways resumed talks on a deal with United Airlines.
US airline shares jumped in reaction to United's discussions with US Airways, which surprised investors after the 
companies called off talks nearly two years ago.
US Airways closed up 10.7 per cent at $7.55 while United's parent rose nearly 7 per cent to $20.23.
The response to the more advanced BA-Iberia deal was less dramatic, having been factored in after the carriers 
announced a memorandum of understanding on the merger last November.
BA closed up 3 per cent at 245p and Iberia ended the day up 2 per cent at EUR2.68.
Their formal agreement yesterday is confirmation that regulators in London and Madrid have approved the structure 
of the deal, which would create the fourth largest airline group by revenues and the third largest in Europe after 
Lufthansa of Germany and Air France-KLM.
The carriers claim that the deal, expected to be completed by the end of this year, would generate savings of about 
EUR400m (£350m) by the fifth year.
But in a sign of possible difficulties, leaders of the Unite union that represents more than 30,000 BA workers warned 
that while they accepted the logic of the merger, workers needed guarantees of job security.
"We support this move, but not at any cost," Steve Turner, Unite national officer for civil aviation, said.
Airlines in consolidation move
The consolidation push among older flag carriers has intensified amid the aviation downturn triggered by the 
financial crisis, and competition from no-frills rivals such as Ireland's Ryanair   , which has twice as many 
passengers as BA, and Southwest Airlines of the US.
While BA and Iberia will retain their brands and be run as separate operating companies under the proposed 
merger, a holding company will be created to sit above them, called International Airlines Group.
One of the deal's potential stumbling blocks is BA's £3.7bn pension scheme deficit.
The airline is working on a recovery plan, due to be approved by the UK pensions regulator by June 30.
But Iberia can pull out of the deal if it decides that the plan would be "materially detrimental to the economic 
premises of the proposed merger".
The deal needs regulatory clearance from Brussels and the approval of both sets of shareholders.

Byline: Pilita Clark in London and Mark Mulligan in Madrid
Highlight: News analysis
An agreement has been signed but the thorny issue of pensions remains an obstacle, say   Pilita Clark and Mark 
Mulligan
Body
The news that British Airways and Iberia have signed a definitive merger agreement resolves several issues around 
this latest attempt to create a fresh force in the global airline industry.
Most importantly, it means the deal is still on track. The two airlines first announced their tie-up plans in November, 
when they said they would sign a full merger agreement by March 30.
That date came and went last week without an announcement, raising some eyebrows. But the technical hitches 
behind the delay seem, for now, finally settled.
Second, there is now a name for the new holding company being set up for the merged body: International Airlines 
Group or, as it will inevitably become known, IAG.
Finally, it is now known that a number of authorities and regulators in the UK and Spain have signed off on the 
basic structure of IAG, which will be headquartered in London; registered in Madrid; listed in both cities; and run by 
BA's current chief, Willie Walsh, who will become its chief executive.
BA shareholders are to receive 55 per cent of the new company and Iberia shareholders 45 per cent, or 56 per cent 
to 44 per cent once the tie-up is finalised and cross-shareholdings are cancelled. BA and Iberia will still exist as 
brands and operating companies, with their own boards, chief executives and finance directors.
So if BA has not yet settled the fractious dispute with its cabin crew by the time this deal is due to be completed at 
the end of 2010, it will be Keith Williams, BA's current finance director and future chief executive, who will be sitting 
across the negotiating table with union leaders rather than Mr Walsh.
Before he moves offices, however, Mr Williams is going to be busy tackling one of the largest potential stumbling 
blocks to this deal: BA's £3.7bn pension deficit.
BA and Iberia on course for merger
Iberia has the right to walk away from the deal if it decides a deficit recovery plan - due to be approved by June 30 - 
is "materially detrimental" to the proposed merger.
BA has already come to an agreement with the unions over the deficit, with employees agreeing to contribute up to 
£37m more to the retirement scheme each year if they want to retain the current level of benefits. That arrangement 
now needs the green light from the pension fund's trustees and the UK Pensions Regulator before it goes to Iberia 
for approval.
Another, perhaps greater, uncertainty, is how much the deal will help both carriers' struggle to contain costs without 
triggering damaging strikes in the face of growing competition from no-frills airlines such as Ryanair, whose 66m 
passengers already outnumber the 58m BA and Iberia expect to carry each year if their tie-up succeeds.
BA is on course to announce its second consecutive full-year loss this year. Iberia suffered its first annual loss in 13 
years in 2009.
The dramatic downturn in the Spanish carrier's short-haul business has forced an overhaul of its domestic and 
European routes, which it plans to bundle into a separate structure with lower operating costs, in the process 
breaking with the heavily unionised permanent staff.
Iberia's pilots, cabin crew and ground staff are wary of such plans. However, they view the BA tie-up more 
favourably, seeing it as crucial to the airline's long-term survival.
A spokesperson for the Iberia chapter of the Spanish pilots union said yesterday he believed the merger with BA 
could be positive for workers, but there was concern about whether it would result in large job losses in the airlines' 
marketing, sales and back office divisions.
The companies are targeting cost savings of EUR400m (£349m) per year by the fifth year after completion of the 
merger.
A quarter of that will come from IT and back office savings, but slightly more will come from savings on their 
combined fleet of aircraft. They are also hoping to make savings on maintenance and purchasing. The plans will 
cost EUR350m to implement. However, even if all the cost savings are achieved, there remains the larger question 
of whether this attempt to create Europe's thirdbiggest airline by revenue will succeed.
The most recent comparable precedent, the Air France-KLM tie-up, has not impressed some investors. That airline 
looks as if it will be the last of the major European carriers to return to profit after the aviation downturn. Its merger 
made it larger, as will BA and Iberia's. If they gain greater financial strength, that will be an achievement indeed.

Body
Ryanair has criticised the Stormont Assembly for its decision to refer the runway extension at Belfast City Airport to 
a public inquiry, which will delay this promised runway extension by a further 18 months until early 2012, at the 
earliest.
The no-frills airline said it is concerned that there is now a real possibility that the runway at Belfast City may not be 
lengthened, if the results of this public inquiry are unsuccessful.
It said that it was in discussions with Belfast City Airport about five new European routes and up to 500,000 extra 
passengers annually, which would sustain 500 new jobs in and around City Airport.
This new investment, new routes and new jobs have now been postponed and possibly lost to Northern Ireland as a 
result of the Govt's decision to refer the runway extension to a public inquiry, Ryanair said. Ryanair pointed out that 
other airports across the UK and the rest of Europe were forging ahead with lower cost offers and improved 
facilities and will now take the aircraft, traffic and jobs that have been lost by Belfast as a result of this 18 month 
delay in City Airport's runway extension. Ryanair's existing services from BCA to London, Glasgow Prestwick, 
Liverpool, East Midlands and Bristol will continue for the moment, although passenger and baggage numbers 
continue to be impacted by City Airport's short runway. The runway extension would allow these restrictions to be 
lifted, which would enable Ryanair to offer lower fares and more passengers and stimulate inbound traffic and 
tourism for Northern Ireland. Speaking in Belfast this morning, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "While obviously we 
respect the decision of the N.I. Govt to refer the runway extension to a public inquiry, this 18 month delay will mean 
that Belfast have lost out on 5 new routes, 500,000 passengers and up to 500 new jobs here in Northern Ireland. 
Sadly Belfast City's loss will now be gained by other Spanish and Italian airports, who are able to offer lower costs 
and unrestricted airport facilities to capture Ryanair's growth. We will continue to work with our partners in Belfast 
City Airport to assist the public inquiry, but want to apologise to the people of Northern Ireland that the low fare

access to Continental Europe, which Ryanair's new routes would have delivered at Belfast City Airport, will now be

Body
British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia have signed a merger agreement, sealing a long-awaited deal to create 
the world's third largest airline by revenue.
The deal, which creates a group with a combined market value of around dollar 8 billion, majority owned by BA 
shareholders, ends the British company's long pursuit of Iberia, and will allow it to emulate rivals Lufthansa and Air 
France who have successfully acquired smaller peers.
"The terms and conditions of the merger agreement are in accordance with the memorandum of understanding 
signed by both airlines in November," the companies said in a joint statement.
The merger will give the two loss-making airlines the scale they need to ride out the industry downturn and compete 
with larger rivals and budget carriers such as Ryanair. BA and Iberia shareholders will be asked to approve the deal 
in November, the merged company will be headquartered in London. The new firm, which will have annual 
revenues of around dollar 20 billion, combines BA's strong position in Europe-to-North America with Iberia's Latin 
American business, and could be reinforced by a planned alliance with American Airlines. The agreement comes 
after recent strikes by BA cabin crew in a dispute over pay and jobs, which cast doubt on BA's future. The merged 
entity, which will fly with 408 aircraft and 200 destinations by the end of 2010, could cut less profitable short-haul 
flights and compete better on the routes it retains. BA and Iberia target annual synergies of about Eur400 million by 
the end of the fifth year as one company. The pair began merger talks in July 2008 in response to slowing 
passenger demand but industry body IATA last week said airlines were slowly climbing out of recession. ( c)

The main Dublin shares index took another dip this morning as investors sold off on CRH and Aer Lingus shares 
while economy worries - both at home and abroad - continued to weigh on sentiment.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 10.79 points to 3,257.26.
Conflicting data from the US on President Obama's highways stimulus scheme continued to chip away at CRH's 
shares. The latest raft of US highway construction data illustrates continuing concerns (in March) over the 
prospects for federal highway funding as well as the impact of poor weather conditions in February. While there has 
been a significant increase in the value and volume of contract awards, conversion of this to construction put-in-
place was hampered by poor weather in February. Shares in the Irish group fell by 21c to E18.30.
Shares in Aer Lingus dropped by 3c to E0.74 - a decline of 4pc - after it said it carried a total of 782,000 passengers 
in March, a fall of 6.3pc from the same time last year. Its long-haul passenger numbers slumped by 20.7pc to 
69,000 last month while its short-haul passenger numbers also fell by 4.7pc to 713,000. The airline said its load 
factor - or how many seats it manages to fill on each flight - crept 0.3 points higher to 75.9pc as capacity fell by 
11.3pc. Ryanair's shares rose 2c to E3.97. Bank of Ireland has issued an update on its review of its defined benefit 
pension schemes aimed at eliminating its end-December 2009 deficit of E1.6bn. According to the statement, if 
members agree to some changes to the schemes, primarily involving future pension increases and how future 
salary increases qualify for pension, it would eliminate approximately 50pc of the December 31st 2009 IAS-19 
deficit. If the proposals are agreed, the bank plans to increase its cash contributions to the schemes 'so as to 
eliminate the 50pc balance of the 31 December 2009 IAS-19 deficit over approximately six years'. The bank notes 
that these proposals would be income positive for the group. Shares in the bank rose 7c to E1.81 while AIB gained 
1c to E1.44 and Irish Life and Permanent jumped 13c to E3.23. Klabin, Brazil's largest paper-maker, announced a

USD30/tonne in May and USD20/tonne in June - and are in response to easing input costs and improving market

The main Dublin shares index edged higher as the ECB at last intervened in the Greek crisis, acting to prevent it 
spiralling out of control and affecting the rest of the eurozone.
At the close, the ISEQ rose 7.46 points to 3,275.51.
The markets welcomed the announcement that the ECB is to keep interest rates at their record 1pc low as this had 
been expected well in advance and were buoyed by increased signs that the EU will jump in to help Greece. The 
European Central Bank extended a helping hand to Greece on Thursday by prolonging easier rules on debt eligible 
as security against cheap central bank cash. Government debt - including Greek bonds - will also be exempt from 
tougher new risk margins for riskier assets, although banks will still receive less money in return for Greek bonds if 
the country's credit rating deteriorates further.

British Airways and Spain's Iberia signed an USD8 billion merger to create the world's third-largest airline on 
Thursday, bringing a three-way tie-up with American Airlines a step closer.
The deal between BA and Iberia, which the pair hope to complete by December, is designed to help BA and Iberia 
stem over dollar 1 billion of combined annual losses following the worst industry downturn in decades.
They hope to cut costs by 400 million euros a year to better compete with larger rivals Lufthansa and Air France 
and budget carriers such as Ryanair.
The combined group, to be majority owned by BA shareholders, ends the British company's long pursuit of Iberia 
and positions the companies for further consolidation. BA, Iberia and American, members of the Oneworld alliance, 
want to deepen the pact to take advantage of the U.S./EU "Open Skies" agreement, which liberalises transatlantic 
aviation. "The tie-up with American is the next thing on BA and Iberia's agenda now and this agreement brings that 
closer but they are probably looking at European and Asian carriers too," said Davy Stockbrokers analyst Stephen 
Furlong. "There are too many airlines in the world and bigger will be better in the future. BA will hope that this is the 
start of many more tie-ups." On Wednesday, sources said United Airlines was in merger talks with US Airways in a 
deal that could create the second-largest carrier in the U.S. The Oneworld alliance will hold a news conference in 
Los Angeles later on Thursday to announce a joint venture between American and Japan Airlines on Pacific routes, 
an industry source said. BA's Chief Executive Willie Walsh and Iberia boss Antonio Vazquez will both be present. 
Vazquez, who will chair the merged International Airlines Group, said a combined BA-Iberia would "participate in 
future industry consolidation." BA and Iberia will continue to operate under their original brands - mirroring the 
structure of the 2004 Air France-KLM merger, in which both carriers kept their own fleets and networks but are 
owned by a common holding company. "The name itself reflects a longer term intention to add more airlines without

favouring any one company," said Societe Generale analyst Jonathan Wober. BA shares were up 0.7 percent at

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet plc (EZJ.L) Thursday said it carried more passengers in March, compared to 
last year, and load factor increased 2.8 percentage points from March 2009.
Load factor, or the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available, in March improved to 
87.5% from 84.7% in the prior year.
In March, the airline's passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, increased 13.5% to 3.96 million 
from 3.49 million in the prior year.
According to the company, which last month revealed the appointment of Carolyn McCall OBE as its new CEO, 
earned seats include seats that are flown whether the passenger turns up or not, as well as seats provided for 
promotional purposes and to staff for business travel.
In February, the company's load factor declined 1.7% from the previous year, while the number of passengers 
carried in the month increased over 12%.
For the 12 months ending March 2010, easyJet's load factor increased 1.5% points to 86.4% from 84.9% and 
passengers carried advanced 6.8% to 47.22 million from the previous year's 44.20 million.
Among peers, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Wednesday reported a 13% rise in March passenger traffic to 
5.3 million from 4.7 million a year earlier. Load factor for the month increased to 79% from 77% in the previous 
year.
British Airways plc (BAY.L, BAIRY.PK) said Wednesday that passenger load factor in March rose to 74.7% from 
72.7%. However, traffic, measured in terms of revenue passenger kilometers, declined 11.4% to 8.099 billion from 
9.141 billion in the previous year, hurt by cabin crew strikes.
EZJ.L closed Wednesday's regular trade at 469.80 pence, down 4.10 or 0.88%, up 981,832 shares.

People do not pay to travel on grounded planes, so no surprise that British Airways saw traffic plunge in March. But 
racking up a year-on-year drop that matches October 2001, in the wake of 9/11, shows just how deeply last month's 
strikes gouged the troubled flag carrier. BA carried 14.6 per cent fewer passengers compared with March 2009 - 
exactly the same decline as in October 2001.
At first blush, this looks like no more than another reminder that aircraft are the most thankless investment on the 
planet. They gobble up cash but their income stream is vulnerable to all four horsemen of the apocalypse and more 
besides. In recent years the industry has suffered from terrorism, pestilence (the Asian Sars virus of 2003), 
economic recession and rocketing oil prices. It also has a habit of attracting the bolshiest staff: pilots can give 
bankers a run for their money any day. Even in Britain, where the species was heavily culled, trade unions retain a 
strong voice. Like any other asset-intensive industry, airlines struggle to keep supply and demand on an even keel. 
BA has slashed its winter season capacity by 9 per cent since the end of 2007; fewer planes plying the globe are 
partly to blame for the wretched March traffic figures.
But not all carriers are created equal.
Ryanair, the budget airline that - if you believe the spleen vented on blogs and elsewhere - everyone hates, is still 
pulling in the punters. Passenger numbers increased 13 per cent in March, and it carries more than twice as many 
as BA to boot. Even while harassed families gripe about hiked baggage costs over the summer months they 
continue to book seats. Two wings can be good - just not very often.

Strikes cut BA traffic by 15%

Highlight: Passenger numbers fall to post-9/11 levels
Cabin crew walk-outs cost company £45m
Body
The damage inflicted on British Airways from cabin-crew walkouts was revealed yesterday when the airline 
disclosed a decline in passenger numbers in March equivalent to the fall it suffered in the month after the 
September 11 terrorist attacks.
The 15 per cent drop in passenger numbers last month came amid seven days of strikes by cabin crew that BA said 
could cost it up to £45m. While the airline blamed winter cutbacks for some of the reduction in its operational 
capacity, it was the worst March in more than a decade for passenger numbers.
The figures came as the Unite union representing most of BA's 13,400 flight attendants revealed talks to avert 
further industrial action had resumed over the Easter weekend and "some serious progress" had been made.
Tony Woodley, Unite's joint general secretary, said negotiations would keep going over the next few days and no 
further strike dates would be set while productive talks continued.
Throughout the disruption, BA fought a sharp verbal war with Unite over the real effect of the two walk-outs staged 
for three days after March 20 and four days after March 27 , insisting its use of hired aircraft and flight crew had 
helped keep a substantial proportion of its passengers flying.
But its monthly traffic figures published yesterday revealed it carried just 2.2m passengers worldwide in March, 14.6 
per cent fewer than in the same month last year, and well below the numbers normally seen for the relatively quiet 
month. The fall in BA's passenger numbers in March was equal to the decline it suffered in October 2001, when the 
September 11 terrorist attacks prompted one of the global airline industry's worst downturns.
In contrast, Ryanair reported yesterday that its passenger numbers had jumped by 13 per cent in March to 5.3m, a 
figure that the no-frills airline said was probably helped in "small part" by the BA strike.
Strikes cut BA traffic by 15%
However, analysts were encouraged by the fact that BA's figures were above expectations on some fronts, 
especially lucrative first and business-class passenger traffic, which fell by 7.2 per cent in March, compared with a 
12.2 per cent fall in economy traffic.
"They were ahead of my own expectations and the underlying environment, which is the most important part of this, 
continues to improve," said Neil Glynn, an analyst at Credit Suisse.
BA confirmed that the total cost of the March strike action could be between £40m and £45m, with half of the 
capacity reduction owing to strikes and half to planned winter capacity cuts.
BA shares fell 2 per cent to 238.20p.

British Airways March Traffic Down On Cabin-Crew Strikes - Update
British Airways March Traffic Down On Cabin-Crew Strikes - Update
RTT News (United States)
April 7, 2010 Wednesday

Body
(RTTNews) - Marred by a two cabin crew strikes, the third largest European carrier British Airways (BAY.L), 
Wednesday, reported a slump in March traffic, even as its smaller rival Ryanair Holding gained new heights on 
robust traffic. British Airways, attributed half of the decline to the employees strike, while the other half was claimed 
to be due to planned winter capacity reductions. Nevertheless, the airline recorded an improvement in its load factor 
for March.
Though staff level was trimmed with a view to improve annual savings, the strike actually defeated the cause 
denting the airline's March traffic which declined 11.4% to 8,099 million from the prior year level. The total impact of 
the strike action in the month is estimated to be GBP 40- GBP 45 million.
The decline represents an 18.6% decline of traffic in UK/Europe traffic, a 25% decline in Asia Pacific and 10.3% 
decline in Africa and Middle East. Traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometers comprised a 7.2% decrease in 
premium traffic and a 12.2% decrease in non-premium traffic.
Meanwhile, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY), recorded March traffic that increased 13% from the prior year period.
Passenger capacity of British Airways, measured in available seat kilometers, also dropped 13.7% to 10,850 million 
from a year ago. In Asia Pacific, capacity was down 27.9%, while in UK/Europe it was down 20.5%. In the 
Americas, the decline was 10.5%.
The tussle between the union and the management of British Airways over the issue of downsizing took off officially 
on March 20, 2010, when talks between the parties failed to find an alternative. British Airways stuck to its decision 
to remove at least one crew member from each of its flights, hoping to save around 62.5 million pounds annually, 
which was expected to nullify the impact of volatile fuel prices and falling demand.
Repercussions of the three-day strike were so bad that the company was forced to ground at least 80 planes during 
the strike period, which also disrupted airports ground transport system to a great extent. Despite canceling around 
1,100 to 1,950 scheduled flights, BA said about 65% of its passengers were not affected by the strike.
The struggle, however, went on relentlessly as neither side showed any signs of relenting. The stage was thus set 
for a second round of strike and finally on March 28, 2010, providing more reasons for panic. BA employees started 
agitating for a second time, and this time, opted a four-day stoppage.
British Airways March Traffic Down On Cabin-Crew Strikes - Update
Though BA continued to claim operating in normal schedules, with around 60% of the cabin crew, latest reports, 
however, show that about 200,000 passengers during the tussle took offs using other options.
During March, BA carried 2.23 million passengers, down 14.6% or 382,000 passengers, when compared to 2.61 
million passengers carried during the same period a year ago.
British Airways said when compared to short-haul flights, its long-haul flights was least affected by the strike. For 
the seven days of strikes, the airline operated 79% of long-haul flights and 58%of short-haul.
During the first strike, the company operated around 78% of the long-haul flight, while managing only 50% of short-
haul flights, even after recruiting volunteers and chartering other operators. However, during the second the second 
strike these figures rose to 83% and 67% respectively.
Excluding the impact of the cabin crew strikes, the company noted that the underlying traffic volume confirms the 
trends, with a modest year-on-year improvement in premium traffic and non-premium traffic levels stable.
Despite decline in traffic and capacity, passenger load factor for the month rose 2.0 percentage points to 74.7% 
from 72.7% in the same month a year ago. Cargo, measured in Cargo Tonne Kilometers, rose 6.4%. Volumes were 
helped by the additional capacity available during the strike periods.
Load factor of Ryanair was up 2 percentage points at 79%, compared to 77% recorded in the year-ago period.
Among other strategic developments, British Airways said it concluded consultations with its joint trade unions - 
BALPA, GMB and Unite, on future benefits of defined benefit pension schemes. The new benefit structure, which 
the trade unions will be recommending to their members, will be proposed to the pension trustees and form part of 
the negotiations towards a recovery plan that is expected to be presented to the Pensions Regulator by June 30, 
2010.
BAY.L is currently trading at GBP 238.20, down GBP 5.10 or 2.10%, on a volume of 9.20 million shares. In the last 
52-week period, the stock traded in a range of GBP 117.30 - GBP 255.80, with a three-month average volume of 
11.20 million shares.
RYAAY is currently trading at $29.44, down $0.43 or 1.44%, on a volume of 0.18 million shares. In after-hours, the 
stock traded in a range of $22.79 - $31.92, with a three-month average volume of 0.50 million shares.

(ANSA) - APRIL 7 - Flightcare Italia has won a service  contract with Lufthansa to join that of Alitalia, thus adding  
another blue chip client to the haul of 65 companies it serves  at Rome s airports, including Swiss, Cathay, 
Malaysia, British  Airways, Ethiopian, American Airlines and  Singapore at  Fiumicino and Ryanair and Easyjet at 
Ciampino.
One of the leading ground handling companies operating in  Rome s airports, Flightcare has signed a three-year 
contract  with the German company to provide assistance at Leonardo da  Vinci Airport.
Lufthansa, which licensed flights to AirOne (code sharing),  its partner in the international Star Alliance, had been 
using  the services of Eas at Fiumicino, AirOne s handling service,  which has now been merged into Alitalia-Cai.
According to a memo issued by Flightcare Italia (a branch of  the Spain-based group),''the winning of a new client of  
Lufthansa s stature not only means a boost to our turnover in  economic terms but also significant investments in 
human  resources and technology to enable us to ensure the high level  of assistance the German company has 
always offered its own  customers''.
In the words of Roberto Bruni, General Director of Flightcare Italia, ''The agreement with Lufthansa comes as a 
reward for our quality and competitiveness. We shall continue on our path of  consolidation with an outlook of 
further growth coming through  the acquisition of the airlines Austrian Airlines and Air  Dolomiti by the German 
group''.
Flightcare Italia turned over 60 million euros in 2009, from  a total of 50,282 registered flights at Rome s Fiumicino 
and  Ciampino, catering for a total of 11,702,787 passengers  (6,945,436 at Fiumicino and 4,757,351 at Ciampino).

Ryanair to raise checked baggage charge

Ryanair is increasing its checked luggage fees from £15 to £20 for the busiest summer months of July and August, 
in a move analysts estimated could raise up to £20m.
The Dublin-based airline said it was bringing in the increase, which affects all bookings made after midnight tonight, 
because it was "determined to incentivise passengers to travel light this summer".
The new fees mean people taking a return flight with Europe's biggest no-frills airline will pay £40, or EUR40, in July 
and August, or £20 for each leg of the journey.
EasyJet, Ryanair's main rival, charges £18 for a checked bag weighing up to 20kg on a return flight.
Neither airline charges for carry-on luggage, which each encourages to help speed up airport turnrounds, reduce 
handling costs and boost fuel efficiency.
The new charge at Ryanair, a leader in the trend for airlines to raise extra money by charging for services such as 
on-board food and luggage, could generate substantial revenues, analysts said.
"Assuming about 23m passengers travel during the July-September quarter and 30 per cent of passengers check in 
bags, then revenue of EUR23m (£20.2m) will be generated from this price change," said Joe Gill, of Bloxham 
stockbrokers in Dublin.
"That equates to about 7 per cent of net profits produced in the year to March 2010."
However, Mr Gill said it was not clear that the extra money would fall to the bottom line at Ryanair, which last week 
announced it was raising its profit after tax guidance for the year to March 31 from EUR275m to at least EUR310m 
because of stronger than expected bookings and higher average fares during late February and March.
"First, Ryanair can recycle part of the bag revenue into more competitive fares.

"Second, the penetration rate among passengers could fall in response to the price change," Mr Gill said.

In the 12-month period to the end of March of this year, 66.5 million people travelled with the Irish airline.
Looking at Ryanair's load factor - an industry-wide measure of how efficiently it fills its aircraft - shows a 2pc 
improvement from 77pc in March 2009 to 79pc in March of this year. The 12-month to the end of March 2010 load 
factor stood at 82pc.

Spirit Airlines to charge up to $45 for carry-ons
Spirit Airlines to charge up to $45 for carry-ons

Baggage fees have sneaked out of the belly of the plane and into the overhead bin.
Spirit Airlines will charge as much as $45 each way for a carry-on bag starting Aug. 1. Personal items like purses 
and laptop computers that fit under the seat will still be free.
The new fee makes Spirit the first airline to charge passengers to haul their own possessions onto its planes. It's 
sure to seize the attention of passengers as well as airline executives who are probably glad that Spirit tried it first.
"I didn't think anyone would go this far," said Jay Sorensen, an airline consultant who specializes in airline fees.
Industry observers said Spirit's move doesn't mean it will spread to the big airlines. None of the major carriers 
changed their fees on Tuesday.
Spirit's new charge for a carry-on is $45 if paid at the gate, and $30 if paid in advance. Spirit said on Tuesday that it 
reduced its lowest fares by $40 on average, so most customers won't really pay more to fly. Customers who pay for 
space in the overhead bin will also get to board the plane earlier. The new policy limits paid carry-on bags to one 
per passenger.
Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza said having fewer carry-on bags will help empty the plane faster. He said the idea is to 
get customers to pay for individual things they want, while keeping the base fare low.
"The beauty of it is they will do what they think is best for them and will now have the choice," he said.
Spirit is based in Miramar, Fla., and is privately held. Most of its flights carry leisure travelers from big airports in the 
U.S. through Fort Lauderdale and on to Latin America.
Like Ryanair in Europe, Spirit has relatively low base fares but charges lots of add-on fees, including $16 per round-
trip ticket to book at its Web site. The only way to avoid the fee is to buy a ticket at the airport ticket counter.
Spirit Airlines to charge up to $45 for carry-ons
It has fewer than two dozen planes. Its 150 daily flights are about one-twentieth as many as American Airlines and 
its regional partners offer.
Even though Spirit is a minor player, big airlines will watch it to see whether customers are willing to pay for carry-
ons, Sorensen said. "It's a potential source of revenue for an industry that still needs it."
The problem with charging for checked luggage but keeping carry-ons free is that passengers lug as much onto the 
plane as they can, he said. Spirit's move does help solve that problem, Sorensen said.
Spirit said it will add measuring devices at the gates to determine which carry-ons are free and which ones will incur 
the charge. Things like diaper bags, umbrellas, strollers, and reading material won't count as a passenger's free 
personal item.
The big airlines stepped gingerly when they started charging to check baggage in 2008, making a move, then 
watching to see who matched it. Now, all of them charge to check a bag on domestic flights except Southwest (two 
free bags) and JetBlue (one free bag).
Spirit CEO Baldanza said he's confident the airline will stick with the new carry-on fee.
"Our decision to do it isn't dependent" on other carriers following along, he said.
He said he doesn't see the bag fee as a revenue boost as much as an operational help. Dealing with large carry-
ons has delayed departures and slowed down unloading after a flight.
On domestic flights, passengers who pay in advance will pay $30 to carry on a bag, but just $25 to check it. That 
could encourage passengers to check more bags. Baldanza said that's fine with him, since it costs the airline about 
as much to load one bag into the belly of the plane as it does to load 100 bags.
While it's too soon to know whether passengers will accept the carry-on fee, it actually makes sense to encourage 
them to check bags as Spirit has done, said Genevieve Shaw Brown, senior editor at Travelocity.
Ever since checked bag fees began, "the boarding process has become more chaotic, there's more tension among 
travelers fighting for space in the overhead bin," she said. "It also becomes less efficient to board and deplane, 
which is not good for airlines that make money on being efficient."

overcharging and ordered them to immediately refund customers.
"We are working on a number of overcharging cases that firms have notified to us under the statutory consumer

The ISEQ added to last week's rally this morning amid growing hopes that the economy at home will soon emerge 
from the dark days of recession while there are clear signs that the US is well on the road to recovery.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 26.37 points to 3,271.56.
Goodbody Stockbrokers is standing by its earlier prediction that the country will emerge from recession in the 
second half of 2010, despite shrinking by 1pc this year. In its latest economic report, Goodbody has upgraded its 
previous GDP forecast for 2011 from 2.4pc to 2.8pc on the basis of a higher contribution from net trade. The broker 
says it has seen progress on competitiveness, the budget deficit and the restoration of the banking system to 
'health'. Meanwhile, employment and services activity data show that the US economy is growing at a healthy rate 
and that the pace of expansion is accelerating. Payroll growth has reverted to an early 2007 rate (albeit from a 
depressed base), but services activity has reached mid-2006 levels.
Banks were modestly higher on the ISEQ with AIB up 2c to E1.22, Bank of Ireland rose 4c to E1.84 while Irish Life 
and Permanent gained 6c to E2.98. Traffic numbers from Ryanair are expected to be released today and Davy 
Stockbrokers says it is anticipating loads of around 78pc for the airline. Last week, Ryanair raised its net income 
guidance for FY2010 to Eur310m from Eur275m as a result of somewhat stronger passenger bookings at better 
than expected yields. The airline's full year results are due to be announced on June 1st. Shares in the no-frills 
airline rose 3c to E4.01. Aer Lingus fell 3c to E0.74. Biogen Idec, Elan's US partner, has indicated that it will have 
15 company-sponsored posters and presentations about Tysabri at this year's American Academy of Neurology 
(AAN) conference, which will take place on April 10-17th in Toronto, Canada. This is the premier annual meeting for 
the neurology profession. Several of these posters/presentations will once again build on the superior efficacy 
profile that Tysabri has demonstrated over its rivals, including improvement in physical function and sustained 
visual improvement. Elan's shares climbed 8c to E5.87.

Traffic numbers from Ryanair are expected to be released today and Davy Stockbrokers says it is anticipating loads 
of around 78pc for the airline.
Last week, Ryanair raised its net income guidance for FY2010 to Eur310m from Eur275m as a result of somewhat 
stronger passenger bookings at better than expected yields.
The airline's full year results are due to be announced on June 1st.
Davy's Stephen Furlong says: "We believe that this represents a tipping point on yields, which have fallen by over 
20pc over the last three years from peak to trough. This bodes well for our investment thesis, which always included 
a scenario where growth slows, unit revenue rises and free cash flow increases significantly. "We believe the likely 
causes for improvement are competitor capacity take-out over the last year, particularly against Ryanair; a strong 
mix of new bases and routes; and, in particular, more year-round early sun routes such as Malta and the Canaries. 
Ryanair has also been paring back the level of aggressive discounting relative to last year as competitors raise

Traffic numbers from Ryanair are expected to be released today and Davy Stockbrokers says it is anticipating loads 
of around 78pc for the airline.
Last week, Ryanair raised its net income guidance for FY2010 to Eur310m from Eur275m as a result of somewhat 
stronger passenger bookings at better than expected yields.
The airline's full year results are due to be announced on June 1st.
Davy's Stephen Furlong says: "We believe that this represents a tipping point on yields, which have fallen by over 
20pc over the last three years from peak to trough. This bodes well for our investment thesis, which always included 
a scenario where growth slows, unit revenue rises and free cash flow increases significantly. "We believe the likely 
causes for improvement are competitor capacity take-out over the last year, particularly against Ryanair; a strong 
mix of new bases and routes; and, in particular, more year-round early sun routes such as Malta and the Canaries. 
Ryanair has also been paring back the level of aggressive discounting relative to last year as competitors raise 
prices, Furlong added. Meanwhile, US traffic figures for March report an increase on numbers crossing the Atlantic.

Ryanair today said it is to increase checked-in baggage fees for July and August to E20 per bag.
Checked-in bag fees remain at E15 for passengers travelling outside of the two peak summer months of July and 
August.
Ryanair urged all of its passengers to avoid checked-in baggage fees by travelling with carry-on bags only using its 
10 kilo carry-on baggage allowance.
"Ryanair is determined to incentivise passengers to travel light this summer by increasing our checked-in baggage 
fees for the months of July and August only. These baggage fees, which are avoidable by passengers, will apply to 
bookings made after midnight (24:00hrs) Wednesday for travel in July and August. From 1st September the

Following OnAir's dramatic dropping of Ryanair's contract after equipping no fewer than 50 of the low-cost giant's 
Boeing 737s with its in-flight mobile connectivity service, Mary "Runway Girl" Kirby asks: "Did Ryanair want free or 
nearly-free equipage?" Connectivity isn't cheap, and somebody's got to foot the bill. Ryanair, meanwhile, says it's 
seeking a new service provider. Calling AeroMobile? You may recall the Flight Blog story about Ryan McNaught's 
Qantas A380 Lego replica (pictured) winning top prize at Brickvention, Australia's premier Lego convention. Well, 
McNaught is now set to take on the world at Lego's equivalent of the Olympics, Brickworld, in the USA in June - via 
a V Australia flight; Qantas, he says, is "not interested" enough to provide carriage. Check out what Flight was 
reporting 100 years ago. The front cover has a photograph of King Edward questioning a certain M Bleriot about his 
monoplane at the Biarritz Aviation meeting.

Friends First is a wholly owned subsidiary of pan European insurance group Eureko. It has 250,000 customers in 
Ireland and assets of more than  5 billion.
What are the main responsibilities of your job?
I look after the sales and marketing functions of the Friends First Life Assurance Company, so I have overall 
responsibility for delivering profitable sales growth and increasing market share in this area.
We want to build distribution partnerships with independent brokers, medium to large corporates and professional 
advisers in the financial services sector.
In today's business climate, you can no longer rely solely on the price and performance of your products.
You must be prepared to commit real resources and expertise to assist the financial advisers you partner with, so 
they can trade profitably.
What are your professional motivators?
I want to be a leader in a rapidly-changing industry - one which will be unrecognisable in three years.
How would you describe your work style?
I am prepared to make bold decisions in a transparent, accountable and focused team environment.
What do you regard as your best business decision to date?
In a former role, I had a very steep learning curve as managing director of estate agents Gunne Residential.
Working Week
The experience tested my capability in an industry outside financial services. It taught me that there are no 
boundaries where change is managed effectively.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learned?
The importance of both leadership and a clear strategy.
If you do not fully understand what you are about, your vision of the future will be cloudy. The inevitable result is 
underachievement.
Who do you admire most in Irish industry?
I admire Ryanair's Michael O'Leary.
He is the only business leader we have with truly global reach.
Through one company, he has rewritten the rules for an entire industry - and his vision, conviction and appetite for 
change and success is unrivalled in Ireland today. Given two months in any of our financial institutions, he would be 
well on the way to devising a new business model.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
Recovery will be slow as the balance sheets in companies and households around the country undergo repair.
We have begun to adjust to a new reality and people are making the hard decisions necessary to get through it.
To boost consumer confidence, we need low interest rates and stable employment.
Political leadership and innovative tax measures will be vital to solving the mess.
What is your ultimate professional goal?
In my role with Friends First, I want to instill in my colleagues the belief that, while we are not the market leader in 
Ireland's financial services sector, we can lead market thinking and make a significant contribution to the future 
shape of the industry.

Russian stocks reached their highest level since before the Lehman collapse as the price of crude oil hit an 18-
month peak on Thursday.
The country's equities are fast approaching the level they reached before it fought a five-day war with Georgia in 
August 2008 .
In a shorter European trading week before the Easter holidays, Russia's dollar-denominated RTS index added 5.8 
per cent over the week to 1,607.95. It has risen more than 220 per cent since its trough in January 2009.
Over the week, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 1.5 per cent to 1,094.05. The CAC 40 in France gained 1.4 per cent 
to 4,034.23 and the Xetra Dax rose 1.9 per cent on the week to 6,235.56.
Revisions to data showed that manufacturing activity in the eurozone grew at its fastest pace in more than three 
years last month.
Richemont , the world's largest jewellery maker, rose after agreeing to buy the 67 per cent it does not already own 
in Net-a-Porter, the UK-based online fashion retailer. Investors were relieved after weeks of speculation, sending 
Richemont's shares 1.2 per cent higher over the week to SFr41.60. They have now risen nearly 15 per cent since 
the start of March.
Shares in Finnish drugmaker Orion  sank after US regulators said that the company's drug for Parkinson's Disease, 
which it is developing with Switzerland's Novartis , may be linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. Orion fell 
11.6 per cent to EUR14.69 by Thursday while Novartis slid 1.5 per cent to SFr56.70.
Dublin-based  Ryanair jumped to its highest in more than two years after Europe's biggest low-cost airline 
announced better-than-expected annual profit numbers. It jumped 8 per cent to EUR3.97 on Thursday.
Moscow bolstered by rising oil
Metso in Finland rebounded from three days of losses after the world's biggest maker of rock crushers agreed to 
sell its Flexowell conveyor belt unit to Germany's ContiTech Transportbandsysteme. Metso's shares rose 5.2 per 
cent to EUR25.16 on Thursday.
Switzerland's Petroplus Holdings , Europe's biggest independent refiner, rose as investors were positive about the 
future of oil-refining profits. Its shares added 8.1 per cent to SFr20.87 over the week.
Ferdinand Piëch, chairman of German truckmakers MAN  and Volkswagen,  renewed his push for a three-way 
alliance with Scania  in Sweden, after a long standoff.
Mr Piëch spoke at MAN's annual meeting on Thursday, moments after MAN's chief executive played down the 
speculation that such a strategic alliance would be forged.
The conflicting comments sent shares in all three companies lower over the week. MAN's shares fell 1.7 per cent to 
EUR62.35, Volkswagen lost 1.4 per cent to EUR71.60 while Scania weakened 1.7 per cent to SKr 114.90

Public speaking can broaden your horizons. I recently accepted an invitation to speak on the credit crunch at a 
dinner in Ireland. I had not been to the Republic of Ireland since a freezing weekend in November 2008 when I went 
stalking in County Galway. I woke at 3am drenched in perspiration and resolved to go straight to the doctor on my 
return and get some HRT. Then I realised that I had left the electric blanket on.
On that occasion, I flew from Luton to Galway; this time from Heathrow to Dublin. What a difference 18 months 
makes. Ireland has not had a good recession. Just to make the point, the lunchtime Aer Lingus flight my hosts had 
booked for me included no lunch. You could buy some very average sandwiches from a trolley after consulting a 
laminated menu. If I had wanted to order average sandwiches from a laminated menu, I would have travelled on a 
budget airline! I'd deliberately avoided EasyJet or Ryanair in case I was charged for the privilege of breathing. But I 
still ended up reading a laminated menu.
The story didn't get much better once we touched down. My hosts had arranged for a taxi driver to meet me at the 
information desk in the arrivals hall. I waited. And waited. Then I called and got the number of the taxi company, 
which led me finally to the number of the driver. After some challenging communication (received pronunciation 
English meets vernacular Irish) I established that he was in the vicinity, but was not planning to park and come to 
meet me since that would cost money. Didn't I know there was a recession on? I was directed to go upstairs and 
meet him outside Door 2 of the departure hall.
Next time any of you are in Dublin airport, have a look at the doors in the departure hall. They are numbered only 
on the outside. By the time I found the taxi driver and made it into Dublin, I was fainting with hunger. I ventured out 
of the hotel and found a branch of Tesco, where I bought some lunch and stocked up on supplies for the flight home 
the next day. I was even starting to regret telling my hosts that I would prefer to speak during dessert. (I usually do 
this to avoid eating yet more unnecessary food. To paraphrase Bette Midler, my view on dessert is that I can either 
eat it or rub it on my thighs, because that is where it is ultimately going.) But I need not have worried. There was no 
dessert! My hosts explained that having dessert might have seemed like unnecessary largesse. There was, after 
all, a recession on.
Back in the UK, I decided not to charge for my next dinner speaking engagement so that my hosts might be able to 
afford dessert. When I got there, they asked me if I would like a present in lieu of a fee. What a nice idea, I said, 
thinking a case of wine (or possibly some dessert) might arrive at the office.
It's Tough To Navigate Through A Recession Without Dessert
The next day, the organiser's office phoned Observant Olivia. My host, it was explained, was very grateful for my 
speech and wanted to buy me something. Not a case of wine, but something I really wanted but couldn't justify 
buying for myself - an aviation GPS. OO thanked them kindly but explained that, just as I aspire to eliminate 
laminated menus from my travel experiences, I also aspire to a Garmin 486, which might look like unnecessary 
largesse. There is, after all, a recession on.
Amazingly enough, a Garmin 486 duly arrived at our office. This produced whoops of joy rarely observed in a 48-
year-old mother-of-three. I spent Mother's Day prevailing on the goodwill of my children to get it set up, loaded up 
with the right software and pressed into action. (For those of you reading this outside the UK, I fly planes, but am 
not a time traveller. Our Mother's Day is in March.) Thanks to the speech I gave, there will be no more laminated 
menus for me, and much broader horizons. Next time I visit Ireland, I am going to fly myself.

News In Brief
## The provisional administrators of Quinn Insurance have received about 20 inquiries from groups interested in 
buying all or part of the company's business. The administrators have told those interested in assets that it is 
"premature" to consider a sale at this point. "If we decide to sell all or any part of the business in the future, we shall 
contact you to ascertain whether you wish to participate in the sales process," they said. - Irish Times
## The interest rate on 10-year Irish government debt fell five basis points (0.05pc) to 4.42pc yesterday -- the 
biggest fall among eurozone government bonds -- as IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said the Government's actions 
have been vital to maintain financial stability in Ireland. - Irish Independent
## Three groups of architects, comprising mainly Irish practices, have been chosen to go on to the final stage of the 
competition to redesign the ESB's headquarters on Lower Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin. The practices come in groups 
because the competition for the office redesign only allowed entries from practices that had a fee income of at least 
2.5m euro a year which, at the time, narrowed the field to about six architectural firms in Ireland. The three winning 
consortiums are Grafton Architects, O'Mahony Pike, DEGW and BDSP; Henry J Lyons and Gilroy McMahon; and 
Scott Tallon Walker, the last being the only single practice in the final three. The competition attracted 44 entries 
across the world. - Irish Times ## Almost three-quarters of the 35.6bn euro of loans that Anglo Irish Bank is 
dumping in the National Asset Management Agency are classified by the embattled bank as being in trouble. Anglo 
is set to transfer half of its 72bn euro loan book in NAMA by the end of this year, making it by far the biggest 
participant in the State's 'bad bank'. The group's annual report, released this week, shows that more than 70pc of 
the 35.6bn euro of property and construction loans it is moving to NAMA are classified as 'impaired'. This means 
that loan repayments are well in arrears, or the value of the assets used as security has collapsed -- or both. - Irish 
Independent ## Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has apologised to Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey 
Roundup: 20 buyers emerge for Quinn firm 20 Buyers
for incorrectly attributing comments to Mr Justice Peter Kelly in a letter he sent the Minister on February 25th. The 
letter related to Ryanair's application for leave for a judicial review of a determination on airport charges by the 
aviation regulator Cathal Guiomard. "In that letter, I stated that the judge was critical of your delay in appointing an 
appeal panel," Mr O'Leary stated in his letter dated March 31st. "This was incorrect, inaccurate and should not have 
occurred, as it incorrectly attributed comments to Mr Justice Kelly. The judge did not criticise you in any way." - Irish 
Times ## Close to 3,000 mortgages a month are being restructured, it has been estimated. Lenders are showing 
forbearance by allowing borrowers to take a payment holiday, pay interest only or extend the term of the mortgage. 
Bank of Ireland admitted on Wednesday that it was restructuring 700 mortgages a month. The Irish Banking 
Federation revealed earlier this year that more than 30,000 homeowners had already renegotiated their mortgages. 
But a spokesman for the federation admitted yesterday that this figure dated back to the first or second week in 
January and that the total was likely to have risen in the meantime. - Irish Independent ## Golden Discs has 
reported a loss of 1.5m euro for the 15 months to June 2009, which the group described as "a very difficult trading 
period". Turnover for the 15 months was 22.9m euro, compared to 25.6m euro in the previous financial year to 
March 2008. The Irish company, which went into examinership last year, said it had been "a very difficult year for 
Golden Discs and for the home entertainment market" in Ireland, and attributed its losses to a decline in consumer 
spending on non-essential items. But in a statement issued yesterday, the company said it would survive its current 
difficulties. "We . . . fully expect to trade out of these difficult times," it added. - Irish Times ## Anglo Irish Bank is to 
target the multi-million euro pensions of its former directors as it tries to recover 155m euro in outstanding loans for 
the taxpayer. It has also emerged that the bank's new management team has hired private detectives to track down 
hidden assets belonging to former top management in remote locations all over the world. The scale of Anglo's 
woes was laid bare this week when it emerged that it would cost up to 22bn euro to bail out the biggest corporate 
failure in Irish history. - Irish Independent

buying all or part of the company's business. The administrators have told those interested in assets that it is 
"premature" to consider a sale at this point. "If we decide to sell all or any part of the business in the future, we shall 
contact you to ascertain whether you wish to participate in the sales process," they said. - Irish Times
## The interest rate on 10-year Irish government debt fell five basis points (0.05pc) to 4.42pc yesterday -- the 
biggest fall among eurozone government bonds -- as IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said the Government's actions 
have been vital to maintain financial stability in Ireland. - Irish Independent
## Three groups of architects, comprising mainly Irish practices, have been chosen to go on to the final stage of the 
competition to redesign the ESB's headquarters on Lower Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin. The practices come in groups 
because the competition for the office redesign only allowed entries from practices that had a fee income of at least 
2.5m euro a year which, at the time, narrowed the field to about six architectural firms in Ireland. The three winning 
consortiums are Grafton Architects, O'Mahony Pike, DEGW and BDSP; Henry J Lyons and Gilroy McMahon; and 
Scott Tallon Walker, the last being the only single practice in the final three. The competition attracted 44 entries 
across the world. - Irish Times ## Almost three-quarters of the 35.6bn euro of loans that Anglo Irish Bank is 
dumping in the National Asset Management Agency are classified by the embattled bank as being in trouble. Anglo 
is set to transfer half of its 72bn euro loan book in NAMA by the end of this year, making it by far the biggest 
participant in the State's 'bad bank'. The group's annual report, released this week, shows that more than 70pc of 
the 35.6bn euro of property and construction loans it is moving to NAMA are classified as 'impaired'. This means 
that loan repayments are well in arrears, or the value of the assets used as security has collapsed -- or both. - Irish 
Independent ## Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has apologised to Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey

for incorrectly attributing comments to Mr Justice Peter Kelly in a letter he sent the Minister on February 25th. The 
letter related to Ryanair's application for leave for a judicial review of a determination on airport charges by the 
aviation regulator Cathal Guiomard. "In that letter, I stated that the judge was critical of your delay in appointing an 
appeal panel," Mr O'Leary stated in his letter dated March 31st. "This was incorrect, inaccurate and should not have 
occurred, as it incorrectly attributed comments to Mr Justice Kelly. The judge did not criticise you in any way." - Irish 
Times ## Close to 3,000 mortgages a month are being restructured, it has been estimated. Lenders are showing 
forbearance by allowing borrowers to take a payment holiday, pay interest only or extend the term of the mortgage. 
Bank of Ireland admitted on Wednesday that it was restructuring 700 mortgages a month. The Irish Banking 
Federation revealed earlier this year that more than 30,000 homeowners had already renegotiated their mortgages. 
But a spokesman for the federation admitted yesterday that this figure dated back to the first or second week in 
January and that the total was likely to have risen in the meantime. - Irish Independent ## Golden Discs has 
reported a loss of 1.5m euro for the 15 months to June 2009, which the group described as "a very difficult trading 
period". Turnover for the 15 months was 22.9m euro, compared to 25.6m euro in the previous financial year to 
March 2008. The Irish company, which went into examinership last year, said it had been "a very difficult year for 
Golden Discs and for the home entertainment market" in Ireland, and attributed its losses to a decline in consumer 
spending on non-essential items. But in a statement issued yesterday, the company said it would survive its current 
difficulties. "We . . . fully expect to trade out of these difficult times," it added. - Irish Times ## Anglo Irish Bank is to 
target the multi-million euro pensions of its former directors as it tries to recover 155m euro in outstanding loans for 
the taxpayer. It has also emerged that the bank's new management team has hired private detectives to track down 
hidden assets belonging to former top management in remote locations all over the world. The scale of Anglo's 
woes was laid bare this week when it emerged that it would cost up to 22bn euro to bail out the biggest corporate 
failure in Irish history. - Irish Independent

Public speaking can broaden your horizons. I recently accepted an invitation to speak on the credit crunch at a 
dinner in Ireland. I had not been to Ireland since a freezing weekend in November 2008 when I went stalking in 
Galway. I woke at 3am drenched in perspiration and resolved to go to the doctor on my return and get some HRT. 
Then I realised that I had left the electric blanket on.
On that occasion, I flew from Luton to Galway; this time from Heathrow to Dublin. What a difference 18 months 
makes. Ireland has not had a good recession. Just to make the point, the lunchtime Aer Lingus flight my hosts had 
booked for me included no lunch. You could buy some very average sandwiches from a trolley after consulting a 
laminated menu. If I had wanted to order average sandwiches from a laminated menu, I would have travelled on a 
budget airline! I’d deliberately avoided EasyJet or Ryanair in case I was charged for the privilege of breathing. But I 
still ended up reading a laminated menu.
The story didn’t get much better once we touched down. My hosts had arranged for a taxi driver to meet me at the 
information desk in the arrivals hall. I waited. And waited. Then I called and got the number of the taxi company, 
which led me finally to the number of the driver. After some challenging communication I established that he was in 
the vicinity, but was not planning to park and come to meet me since that would cost money. Didn’t I know there 
was a recession on? I was directed to go upstairs and meet him outside Door 2 of the departure hall.
By the time I found the taxi driver and made it into Dublin, I was fainting with hunger. I ventured out of the hotel and 
found a branch of Tesco, where I bought some lunch and stocked up on supplies for the flight home the next day. I 
was even starting to regret telling my hosts that I would prefer to speak during dessert. (I usually do this to avoid 
eating yet more unnecessary food. To paraphrase Bette Midler, my view on dessert is that I can either eat it or rub it 
on my thighs, because that is where it is ultimately going.) But I need not have worried.
There was no dessert! My hosts explained that having dessert might have seemed like unnecessary largesse. 
There was, after all, a recession on.
Back in the UK, I decided not to charge for my next dinner speaking engagement so that my hosts might be able to 
afford dessert. When I got there, they asked me if I would like a present in lieu of a fee.
Next time, I will fly myself
What a nice idea, I said, thinking a case of wine (or possibly some dessert) might arrive at the office. The next day, 
the organiser’s office phoned Observant Olivia. My host, it was explained, was very grateful for my speech and 
wanted to buy me something. Not a case of wine, but something I really wanted but couldn’t justify buying for myself 
– an aviation GPS. I thanked them kindly but explained that, just as I aspire to eliminate laminated menus from my 
travel experiences, I also aspire to a Garmin 486, which might look like unnecessary largesse. There is, after all, a 
recession on.
Amazingly enough, a Garmin 486 duly arrived at our office. I spent Mother’s Day prevailing on the goodwill of my 
children to get it set up, loaded up with the right software and pressed into action. (For those of you reading this 
outside the UK, I fly planes, but am not a time traveller.
Our Mother’s Day is in March.) Thanks to the speech I gave, there will be no more laminated menus for me, and 
much broader horizons. Next time I visit Ireland, I am going to fly myself.

Irish budget airline Ryanair Holdings PLC raised its full-year profit forecast on Thursday, citing stronger than 
expected passenger bookings in recent weeks.
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low cost carrier, said it was lifting its profit after tax guidance for the year ended March 31 
to "not less than" (EURO)310 million ($418 million), up from the previously forecast (EURO)275 million.
The airline said the revision followed "somewhat stronger than expected passenger bookings, at better than 
expected yields, during late February and March in the run up to the Easter holiday weekend."
Shares in the carrier jumped 7 percent to (EURO)3.93 on the London Stock Exchange.
Ryanair is scheduled to release its full-year earnings on June 1.

climbed 1.3%, while royal/Dutch Shell, the second biggest, rose 0.8% and Total, the third biggest, surged up 1.5%.
Ryanair Holdings, Europe's biggest discount airline, rallied 8% after the company raised its full year earnings 
forecast.
On the other hand, Finnish drugs maker Orion tumbled 10.3% on news the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is 
evaluating data that may suggest the company's key Parkinson's disease drug is tied to increased prostate cancer 
risk.

Moody's adds to pressure on Greek banks

European equities posted their fourth consecutive quarterly gains, even as shares fell in afternoon trading 
yesterday. The losses came after Moody's downgraded five Greek banks and worse-than-expected US jobs data.
Greek banking stocks fell after Moody's said they were under pressure from the country's fiscal challenges. 
National Bank of Greece  fell 2.6 per cent to EUR14.90, EFG Euro-bank lost 2.9 per cent to EUR6.80 and Alpha 
Bank slid 1.3 per cent to EUR7.01.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.1 per cent to 1,075.01 but had its biggest monthly gain since July 2009, rising 6.7 per 
cent.
France's CAC 40 and Germany's Xetra Dax have also seen quarter-on-quarter gains since March 2009.
Bank of Ireland shares soared 24.1 per cent to EUR1.60 after it said it could raise privately about half the 
EUR2.7bn ($3.7bn) it needs to meet capital requirements.
It said it was in talks with investment banks to fill the gap left by property loan sales to the National Asset 
Management Agency, Ireland's "bad bank". Raul Sinha at Nomura said BoI was better positioned to deal with the 
new requirements than its rival, Allied Irish Banks. 
BoI is required to raise 1.7 times its market capitalisation by the end of 2010 while AIB must raise EUR7.4bn of 
equity, or 5.3 times.
"This is likely to lead to further downside for the shares in our view, with AIB likely to end up with a majority 
government holding even after disposal of its UK, US and Polish assets," Mr Sinha said. AIB fell 3.2 per cent to 
EUR1.21.
The preferred shares of Fresenius dipped 0.1 per cent to EUR55.90 after the parent company of the world's 
biggest provider of kidney dialysis proposed to convert all its preferred stock into ordinary shares and to change its 
legal status.
Moody's adds to pressure on Greek banks
Analysts said the move aimed to improve the positioning of Fresenius on the Xetra DAX and increase its flexibility 
to finance further growth if required. Fresenius' ordinary shares gained 6.7 per cent to EUR55.11.
Airlines were in focus after British Airways failed to sign a merger agreement with Spain's Iberia  yesterday for 
"technical reasons". Iberia said the deal to create the world's third-largest airline would be settled within days. Iberia 
shares fell 1.7 per cent to EUR2.59.
Finnair said the first signs of passenger traffic picking up in Europe and Asia were starting to show. Shares in the 
Finnish national carrier climbed 5.8 per cent to EUR4.35.
Dublin-based carrier Ryanair , Europe's largest discount airline, said it had sued the French government for about 
EUR110m for providing "unlawful state aid" to Air France-KLM  in the form of reductions in airport charges on 
domestic routes. Ryanair added 0.5 per cent to EUR3.69 while Air France-KLM fell 0.2 per cent to EUR11.63.
Renewable Energy , one of the world's biggest makers of solar energy equipment, rose after the Norwegian 
company said prices of the wafers used to make solar panels had strengthened. Its shares advanced 9.2 per cent 
to NKr27.80.
Meanwhile, Vestas Wind  rose 1.9 per cent to DKr299.50 after the Danish wind turbine manufacturer said it had 
won an Australian order for 111 turbines, its largest order from that country to date.
France's GDF Suez lost 1.2 per cent to EUR28.61 after it said it planned to raise about $1.5bn in two months to 
finance a power plant in Saudi Arabia it is building with Saudi Electricity.
MTU Aero rose 4.8 per cent to EUR43.71 after Goldman Sachs added the German jet engine maker to its 
"conviction buy" list.

(RTTNews) - Irish airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) Thursday said it increased earnings guidance for 
the year ended March 31, 2010, citing stronger-than-expected passenger bookings at better-than-expected yields, 
during late February and March in the run up to the Easter holiday weekend. Following the news, Ryanair shares 
rose more than 6% on the London Stock Exchange.
Europe's largest low-cost airline currently expects to report annual profit after tax of not less than EUR 310 million, 
up from the previous guidance of EUR 275 million.
While issuing its third quarter results in January, Ryanair said it expects full-year yield decline to be closer to 15% 
rather than the 20% expected earlier. Ryanair expects to announce its full year results on June 1.
RYA is currently trading at EUR 3.91 per share, up EUR 0.23 or 6.32%, on the LSE.
In Wednesday's regular trading session, RYAAY closed trading at $27.17 per share on the Nasdaq.

While issuing its third quarter results in January, Ryanair said it expects full-year yield decline to be closer to 15% 
rather than the 20% expected earlier. Ryanair expects to announce its full year results on June 1.
RYA is currently trading at EUR 3.91 per share, up EUR 0.23 or 6.32%, on the LSE.
In Wednesday&apos;s regular trading session, RYAAY closed trading at $27.17 per share on the Nasdaq.

E275m, to "not less than E310m".
It said that this is as a result of "somewhat stronger than expected passenger bookings" and better than expected 
yields, during late February and March in the run up to the Easter holiday weekend.

following its latest set of results and confidence that it will stay out of majority State ownership.

The main Dublin shares index rose sharply this morning as Bank of Ireland stocks rocketed by over 28pc following 
its latest set of results and confidence that it will stay out of majority State ownership.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 35.83 points to 3,185.33.
Shares in Bank of Ireland jumped more than 28pc this morning after it said that its loan losses had peaked and it 
was in talks with investment banks to raise capital to make up for losses on property loan sales to NAMA. It said it is 
to raise private capital, potentially becoming the only member of the "bad bank" scheme to escape a fresh bailout, 
as the country faces years of scrimping to plug the black hole created by the reckless lending of the property boom 
years in the banking sector. Ireland's biggest bank by market value will privately raise about half of the E2.7 billion 
of the new capital it needs, while the government will convert some of its E3.5 billion of preference shares into 
ordinary equity, remaining a minority shareholder. "Valuing Bank of Ireland shares has been problematic up to now 
given the range of possible outcomes," NCB analyst Ciaran Callaghan said. "But with the uncertainties clearing, the 
investment case is becoming more apparent." Bank of Ireland's outlook contrasts with other NAMA participants 
such as nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, which will need up to E18 billion of fresh state capital, almost as much as 
Dublin borrows in a year to fund its budget deficit.
Shares in AIB fell 1c to E1.24 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 17c to E3.00. Elsewhere, shares in Aer Lingus 
fell 2c to E0.74. Aer Lingus' full-year results and presentation indicate that, while it is still early days, progress is 
being made, according to Davy. As the outlook statement indicated, the full year performance in 2010 is heavily 
dependent on the implementation of the cost reduction programme. "We are encouraged that unit revenue is 
improving in the early part of the year, notably on long haul. We note that short haul was breakeven in 2009 despite 
Gatwick losses. This indicates that most of the E81m in operating losses were in long haul." Short haul in 2009 was 
down in unit revenue terms by 14.3pc but up 3.8pc ex-Gatwick. Although long-haul losses in 2010 are still likely, the 
ISEQ gets a lift from BoI share surge ISEQ Up
numbers will be helped by the changes (i.e. capacity reductions to the network) in long haul/Gatwick and by the 
"Greenfield" cost savings. Belfast appeared loss making in 2009, but trading is improving and it expects profitability 
in 2010. Ryanair's shares edged up 1c to E3.68. According to the BMF (Builders Merchants Federation), UK 
merchanting volumes in February were up 1.1pc on the same month last year. This was the first year-on-year (yoy) 
growth in the series for two years. Shares in Grafton gained 2c to E3.17.

Falling bank shares have hit the ISEQ in early trade this morning, on what is D for Decision day for the banking 
sector here.
AIB is down 18c so far this morning to 118, with Bank of Ireland slipping 2c to 122.
Their drop has led the ISEQ index 12.64 points lower to 3,144.97.
The latest dip in the two banks' shares comes ahead of a series of major announcements later today that will 
determine their future health and ownership. Both banks are nervously awaiting a raft of announcements that are 
due after the close of markets this evening. These will reveal the level of capital they will have to hold, the amount 
of investment the government will plough into them, and the size of the haircuts they have to take on loans 
transferred to NAMA. The new fall in their share values this morning extends a big slide seen in both yesterday. The 
weakness in the shares reflects worry that today's announcements may be more far reaching than previously 
thought. AIB is now seen as heading for majority state control, with up to 70pc of its equity in public hands, though 
Bank of Ireland is still hoping to avoid majority state control. Irish Life and Permanent, which is not involved in the

Falling bank shares have hit the ISEQ in early trade this morning, on what is D for Decision day for the banking 
sector here.
AIB is down 18c so far this morning to 118, with Bank of Ireland slipping 2c to 122.
Their drop has led the ISEQ index 12.64 points lower to 3,144.97.
The latest dip in the two banks' shares comes ahead of a series of major announcements later today that will 
determine their future health and ownership. Both banks are nervously awaiting a raft of announcements that are 
due after the close of markets this evening. These will reveal the level of capital they will have to hold, the amount 
of investment the government will plough into them, and the size of the haircuts they have to take on loans 
transferred to NAMA. The new fall in their share values this morning extends a big slide seen in both yesterday. The 
weakness in the shares reflects worry that today's announcements may be more far reaching than previously 
thought. AIB is now seen as heading for majority state control, with up to 70pc of its equity in public hands, though 
Bank of Ireland is still hoping to avoid majority state control. Irish Life and Permanent, which is not involved in the 
latest bailout of the sector, has seen no change in its hare price this morning at 290. Other shares on the move this 
morning included DCC, up 30 to 1917, and Ryanair, which has lifted by 2c to 370. CRH has dipped by 1c to 1863

(RTTNews) - Rejecting Air France-KLM claims over alleged subsides, Ryanair Holdings PLC (RYAAY, RYA.L ), 
Tuesday said that there is no basis for Air France's false claims that Ryanair receives subsidies or State Aid.
Hitting back, Ryanair also pointed that "It is remarkable that Air France should falsely accuse Ryanair of receiving 
subsidies or State Aid, when it is Air France which has been repeatedly found by the EU Commission to have 
received subsidies and unlawful State Aid. In total over the past 2 decades, Air France and KLM have received 
unlawful State Aid subsidies of well over EUR 1 billion. "
Supporting its claim, Ryanair also pointed to the recent ruling of the European Court of First Instance observing that 
Ryanair's long-term, low cost agreement at Brussels Charleroi Airport was lawful and so Ryanair did not receive 
either subsidy or State Aid. The court also remarked that Ryanair's discounted cost agreement with Brussels 
Charleroi was State Aid as an "error of law" which "must be annulled".
The European Court of First Instance has also annulled similar allegations made by the commission against 
Ryanair earlier in March 2009, alleging that Ryanair received advantages from the Walloon Region and Charleroi 
Airport
With reference to the Brussels case, Ryanair said it believes that these latest claims made by Air France is 
designed to hide the damages it done to French regional airports and tourism. Ryanair said Air France is restricting 
the growth of regional airports and tourism, by offering only domestic connections to its hubs at Paris CDG and 
Orly.
The current tussle between Air France-KLM and Ryanair actually popped up with the registration of a complaint by 
Air France in November to the EU commission. The complaint alleged Ryanair of receiving illegal subsidies 
amounting to about EUR 660 Million by way of reduced airport taxes or ground-handling fees from at least 25 
french airports.
Ryanair at that time also hit back with a speedy response by saying that it is least concerned to such false claims 
made by high-fare, fuel-surcharging airlines like Air France.
At its Paris press conference, Ryanair also noted that it is actually Air France which has received unlawful State Aid 
in the form of discounted airport charges on domestic routes and other direct State subventions.
Ryanair Dismisses Air France Claims As False - Update
Ryanair also said it believes that Air France has already been proven by the European Commission to have 
received in excess of EUR 1 billion in unlawful State Aid since 1994. This is in addition to the EUR 400 million 
received by Air France's subsidiary KLM in State aid at Amsterdam airport in 2008/2009.
RYAAY is currently trading at $27.33, up $0.14 or 0.51%, on the Nasdaq.

Ryanair style top-up charges proposed to cut UK's debt
Ryanair style top-up charges proposed to cut UK's debt
Citywire

Record government debt requires a far-reaching review of public services and how they are paid for, including the 
introduction of more Ryanair style top-up charges, PricewaterhouseCoopers has proposed.
Nick Jones, director of PwC's public sector research centre, said: 'The use of charging by government has so far 
received little attention and yet this is an area where Britain raises less revenue as a percentage of GDP than 
comparable OECD nations such as Australia and Canada.'
Top-up charges already exist in parts of the public sector. Examples include extra charges for the Post Office to 
check passport applications, prescription charges and dental care, congestion charging and university tuition fees.
'The experience of low cost airlines such as Ryanair shows the possibilities: changes to service provision have 
been accepted for add-ons e.g. speedy boarding,' according to the report entitled 'Time to choose: Decision-making 
in an age of fiscal austerity'
The team at PwC calculates that if Britain were able to generate comparable levels of non tax revenue, an extra 
1.9% of GDP could be raised, filling half the fiscal gap.
That would reduce the need for tax rises and spending cuts.
Charging for more services could also help reduce demand and therefore cutting costs, the report said.
Devolving more power to local authorities could provide citizens with a clearer picture of what they receive for the 
taxes they pay and provide a greater reason to vote in local elections, it added.
Jones said if politicians are to win public backing for changes they need to make a case for change and will need to 
be transparent about spending, decision-making and spending priorities.
In any case, Jones said efficiencies won't be enough to cut the debt.
'The lesson from history is that a focus on efficiency is rarely enough to turn around major fiscal deficits.'
That echoes criticisms leveled at chancellor Alistair Darling at today's Treasury Select Committee on the Budget.
John Thurso MP criticised Darling for his continued focus on efficiency instead of honesty about the fact that 
spending cuts or tax rises are coming.
Ryanair style top-up charges proposed to cut UK's debt
'Don't you think everyone would be more respectful if you said we're going to cut? Isn't the country grown up 
enough to take that on board?' he asked.
Darling reiterated his view that the debt can be cut while front-line services are protected and without damaging the 
recovery. The chancellor said there is cross-party agreement that efficiencies are needed.
Jones said public sector pay is the most significant element of cost for public services and there is electoral support 
for change here too.
'Relatively small percentage savings in the total pay bill can produce large savings in cash terms', he said.

Byline: Kevin Brown in Kuala Lumpur
Highlight: Tony Fernandes
Chief executive, AirAsia
The head of the world's lowest-cost airline and the Lotus Formula One team defends his multi-tasking approach, 
writes Kevin Brown 
Body
Tony Fernandes is running late. The chief executive of AirAsia is in Kuala Lumpur briefly between a trip to the UK to 
check on Lotus, his Formula One racing team, and a planned flight to Vietnam to finalise an airline joint venture. 
"I'm glad we don't run the airline on his personal timetable," groans an aide.
When Mr Fernandes arrives, his schedule turns out to be something of a sore point. He has recently been accused 
by Tony Davis, chief executive of Tiger Airways, a Singapore-based rival airline, of losing his focus on AirAsia - the 
region's biggest budget carrier and the world's lowest cost airline - in the excitement of his involvement in motor 
racing. He is clearly eager to hit back.
"Just because one person might only be able to do one thing at a time doesn't mean all of us are the same," he 
says. "I can run an F1 team and run an airline, and ultimately what I'm doing is setting up businesses and putting 
other people in there to run them. Lotus F1 is no different."
In fact, say his staff, Mr Fernandes is being rather modest about his ability to multi-task. A serial entrepreneur who 
has founded four airlines - AirAsia, its long-haul affiliate Air-Asia X and joint ventures in Indonesia and Thailand - he 
is also part-owner, with his long-time business partner Kamarudin Meranun and others, of the privately held Tune 
Group. Tune runs substantial hotel, financial services and mobile phone businesses.
His core interest remains, however, AirAsia, whose spartan headquarters in Kuala Lumpur's low-cost carrier 
terminal, a short drive from the airport, could have been designed as an object lesson in rigid cost control. Bustling 
in from the lift, Mr Fernandes leads the way to his small office in a corner of the airline's open plan administrative 
floor.
A driven man at the controls
Casually dressed, though without his trademark red baseball cap ("I've had to stop wearing them - people keep 
asking me to sign them."), the 45-year-old talks quickly, with a strong English accent, breaking off every now and 
then to speak to colleagues holding a financial planning meeting a few feet away.
When he bought AirAsia through Tune for a token M$1 plus M$40m debt in 2001, it was a failing state-owned 
regional carrier with two aircraft. Starting with $250,000 in cash, Mr Fernandes has built the airline up to 90 aircraft 
with costs per passenger kilometre lower than both Southwest Airlines of the US, which invented the low-cost 
model, and Ryanair, the Irish group often regarded as the world's most competitive carrier. AirAsia now has a 
market capitalisation of just over $1.1bn (EUR820m, £740m).
It has grown fast thanks to a rigorous focus on keeping down costs, combined with rapid economic growth across 
Asia, the gradual liberalisation of the region's air services and generally low levels of congestion at many Asian 
airports, which speeds up aircraft turnround times. "It's all about keeping costs down," says Mr Fernandes. "We are 
the lowest-cost airline in the world and we will continue to be. That's what I focus on, and if you had sat in our 
budget meeting last week you'd have seen that that's all I talk about."
The Vietnam joint venture, if it goes ahead, would give AirAsia operations in four of the five biggest members of the 
Association of South East Asian Countries, a 10-country grouping with an economy bigger than India's and a 
population of 600m, which is the airline's main target. The fifth country is the Philippines, which Mr Fernandes says 
is still on the agenda. "The huge advantage that we have . . . is that we are where we are because we have 
invested in all these destinations and now we begin to milk money because the investment has been done over 
eight years," he says. "So if [competitors] want to grow they are going to have put flags everywhere, and every flag 
they put there's an AirAsia flag there already, so they're going to have to compete with an established brand and an 
established competitor. It's like me saying I'm going to go and compete with Ryanair [in Europe] right now. I might 
as well take a gun to my head and shoot myself."
A UK-trained accountant, Mr Fernandes spent his early working life in the music business, as a financial controller 
for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group and, later, as an executive for Warner Music. But it was Sir Stelios Haji-
Ioannou, founder of EasyJet, the low-cost airline, who was responsible for his foray into aviation. Mr Fernandes had 
quit Warner and was watching television in 2001 in London, when he saw Sir Stelios talking about the company. 
Struck by his enthusiasm, Mr Fernandes rushed to EasyJet's base at Luton Airport, video camera in hand, and 
instantly decided to set up an Asian equivalent - a train of events that makes him one of the few people in the world 
to have been inspired at the airport. "Yes, I had a look, and filmed [the aircraft]," he says with a laugh. "But I 
wouldn't say it was the airport [that inspired me]; it was what was in Luton Airport."
Mr Fernandes says his first thought was to start a long-haul low-cost airline flying between Kuala Lumpur and 
London - mainly because of his memories of being unhappy at Epsom College, the English private school where he 
was sent at 12. "You've read all of the Tom Brown's Schooldays stories]. . . it was like it really was true. So I called 
my mum . . . and I asked, "Can I come home for half term?' And she said, 'No, its just too expensive.' And there in 
my mind was like, 'I must make airlines cheap for people to fly.'"
As it turned out, Epsom College was not so bad, and Mr Fernandes now sends his daughter there. But a business 
plan for the long-haul airline that he had discussed with banks was torn up and replaced with a short-haul plan on 
the advice of Conor McCarthy, a former Ryanair and Aer Lingus executive who is now a director of AirAsia.
The long-haul operation was eventually launched in 2007, but it is one of the ventures that triggered claims Mr 
Fernandes was losing focus. The others are his sporting interests, which include an unsuccessful attempt to buy 
West Ham, the Premiership football club.
Mr Fernandes says his sporting activities are separate from AirAsia and have no impact on his management time. 
Lotus, for example, is a private venture managed through the Tune Group, and he says there is no chance AirAsia 
will emerge as a major sponsor for Lotus, even when its current contract with the Williams team runs out after this 
season.
A driven man at the controls
He laughs when asked whether he considered making the investment through the airline. "No, never," he says. 
"Can you imagine going to the stock market saying you're buying a Formula One team? That was never in my 
thought process. Your readers would have a coronary."
Mr Fernandes says shareholders understand the difference between his private and public business activities. But 
there is nevertheless a positive spin-off for AirAsia. "All my activity over the last one-and-a-half months has made 
AirAsia a more famous brand because it's 'Tony Fernandes, founder of AirAsia' all the time."
Mr Fernandes says his initial objective for Lotus - a famous but moribund brand founded by the engineer Colin 
Chapman - was achieved when both cars finished the season's first grand prix in Bahrain. Two major objectives 
remain: ensuring that the cars do at least moderately well in the Malaysian Grand Prix next Sunday, and winning a 
bet with Virgin's Sir Richard that Lotus will end the season ahead of the Virgin team. The two have agreed that the 
loser will serve drinks dressed as an air hostess.
But Mr Fernandes clearly thinks he is on to a winner with Lotus, even if it turns out the joke is on him. "AirAsia is 
exactly like Colin Chapman," he says. "He started with very little money, but he had innovation, and AirAsia is 
exactly like that. We started with two new planes and $250,000. I'm sure many people laughed at us. They're not 
laughing any more."

No-frills airline, Ryanair, this morning said that OnAir, its in-flight phone service provider, is to terminate the contract 
after 13 months proving period of service operations.
Ryanair said it was pleased with the performance of the OnAir system and the rapidly growing call/text and data 
volumes, and had notified OnAir of its wish to roll the service out across the entire Ryanair fleet.
OnAir were unwilling to commit to this expansion at this time, and exercised their right to terminate the agreement 
at the end of the 13 month proving period of service operation.
Ryanair will now invite other in-flight communications providers to tender for access to Ryanair's 73 million annual 
passengers. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair regrets that OnAir were unwilling to commit to roll out its 
in-flight phone service to all Ryanair's 230 plus aircraft fleet. As a result OnAir has decided to terminate its contract 
after a successful 13 month proving period of service operation. We wish to thank OnAir for their help and support 
with this programme to date and wish them well for the future.

Ryanair said it was pleased with the performance of the OnAir system and the rapidly growing call/text and data 
volumes, and had notified OnAir of its wish to roll the service out across the entire Ryanair fleet.
OnAir were unwilling to commit to this expansion at this time, and exercised their right to terminate the agreement 
at the end of the 13 month proving period of service operation.
Ryanair will now invite other in-flight communications providers to tender for access to Ryanair's 73 million annual 
passengers. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair regrets that OnAir were unwilling to commit to roll out its 
in-flight phone service to all Ryanair's 230 plus aircraft fleet. As a result OnAir has decided to terminate its contract 
after a successful 13 month proving period of service operation. We wish to thank OnAir for their help and support 
with this programme to date and wish them well for the future.

Bank shares plummeted on the Dublin stock market this morning after weekend reports that the "haircut" on their 
loan transfers to NAMA will be even more than feared.
Also, participating banks are receiving details today of the new equity they will need to cover future losses and meet 
the Financial Regulator's capital thresholds by the end of this year.
The capital bill is expected to be sharply higher than previously thought.
Reports yesterday suggest that the discount on initial Bank of Ireland loans going to NAMA could be 35pc plus, and 
40pc for AIB. AIB shares have slumped by 35c, or 20pc, this morning to 135, while Bank of Ireland shares are off by 
19c, or 13pc, to 120. Irish Life and Permanent, which is not even involved in NAMA transfers, slid by 15c to 290. 
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was 35.55 points lower a short time ago at 3,176.63. Away from the financials, 
shares were mixed this morning. DCC was up 2c to 1937 and Ryanair lifted by 1c to 371. On the other hand, Elan 
was down 13c to 542 and Smurfit Kappa edged 2c lower to 600.

From Dr Christopher Knee.
Sir, Whether the customer is always right or not is less important than that he or she be treated with respect ("Right 
or wrong, the customer always matters", Michael Skapinker, March 23).
Harry Gordon Selfridge knew this, as did all the other retailers he followed such as Marshall Field in Chicago ("Give 
the lady what she wants"), Au Bon Marché in Paris or A.T. Stewart in New York.
Perhaps a more appropriate quote by Selfridge is: "Remember always that the recollection of quality remains long 
after the price is forgotten."
Interestingly, even those retailers that initially attracted customers through their low prices, such as Marks and 
Spencer's Penny Bazaar, learnt the importance of quality and respect at whatever price level.
Many businesses, including perhaps Ryanair, are able to operate for a time by offering customers what they will buy 
faute de mieux . This is not necessarily, however, what customers want. And if these businesses don't find out what 
that is, someone else will.

Retirement on the cards for Ryanair 's O'Leary
Retirement on the cards for Ryanair's O'Leary

Body
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has told a French newspaper that he plans to retire in two or three years.
O'Leary also told La Tribune that Air France's complaint to the European Commission about subsidies received by 
the low-fare airline was ''fucked, and they know it''. He said the French carrier could ''just go fuck itself''.
The airline boss - whose open-necked check shirt, jeans and bad language gave him the air of a cowboy, according 
to La Tribune - said it was time that Ryanair became a ''serious business''.
''Many people hate me," he said.
''The unions don't like me and neither do the politicians - probably because most of them are illiterate and corrupt - 
and the European Commission isn't my greatest fan."
He predicted that Ryanair would be carrying 80-90 million passengers by 2012. However, he added that, after that, 
he no longer wanted Ryanair to grow by ten million passengers a year, as at present, but at two to three million a 
year.
''In three or four years, Ryanair is going to have to become a big company," he said, ''more respectful of the 
environment, children, old people and all that bullshit," he said.
La Tribune noted that Ryanair's negotiations with Boeing for the delivery of200 planes between 2013 and 2016 had 
stalled last December, and quoted O'Leary as saying that he didn't intend to take delivery of any aircraft in 2013 or 
2014.
The Ryanair boss said that growth would still be possible by closing down unprofitable routes and opening new 
ones, but said any swift growth would be difficult after that.
When asked about his personal plans after retirement, O'Leary said: ''I'll chase after girls or take sumo courses."

Body
(RTTNews) - While buying interest has remained somewhat subdued, stocks have moved mostly higher over the 
course of morning trading on Friday. The major averages have all climbed firmly into positive territory after ending 
the previous session mixed.
The strength in the markets is partly due to some upbeat economic data, including a report from Reuters and the 
University of Michigan showing a bigger than expected upward revision to their reading on consumer sentiment in 
the month of March.
Airline stocks are turning in some of the market's best performances, with Ryanair (RYAAY) helping to lead the 
sector higher amid expectations that the discount European airline could benefit from a strike by British Airlines 
cabin crews.
Most of the other major sectors have also moved to the upside, although most are showing relatively modest 
upward moves. Nonetheless, considerable strength has emerged among gold, housing, oil service, and banking 
stocks.
The major averages have moved roughly sideways in recent trading, holding onto moderate gains. The Dow is up 
63.94 points or 0.6 percent at 10,905.15, the Nasdaq is up 11.47 points or 0.5 percent at 2,408.88 and the S&P 500 
is up 7.02 points or 0.6 percent at 1,172.75.

A sustained bout of bargain hunting after Tuesday's gains helped push the ISEQ index marginally lower while 
Portugal's debt downgrade also hit investor sentiment.
The ISEQ dipped 11.32 points to 3,147.51.
Fitch Ratings cut Portugal's sovereign credit rating by one notch to AA-, citing budgetary under-performance in 
2009 and warning that further under-performance this year and next could cause another downgrade. The change 
underlined concerns that the debt troubles that have afflicted Greece will move to other of the euro zone's weaker 
economies, and it drove European stocks and an already battered single currency lower. Across Europe, the FTSE 
100 index was down 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX fell 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 lost 0.6 percent, while 
Portugal's share benchmark fell 1.8 percent.
Back home, profit takers sent CRH's shares down 44c to E18.64, clawing back most of the stock's gains on 
Tuesday. UK building materials group, Wolseley has formally abandoned its previous approach of global expansion 
through acquisition. Its new strategy is to concentrate and invest in the areas where the group is strong and to 
improve in (or exit) the areas where the group is weak or has limited potential. In relation to the latter, these 19 
business units (out of a total of 41) currently represent almost 20pc of revenues but only 5pc of trading profits. 
Shares in Grafton fell 7c to E3.06. Shares in Ryanair were flat at E3.46. In the last three months of last year, the 
airline surprised the market with a 23pc yield decline to E29.55 per passenger, though the relative unimportance of 
the final quarter for profits limited the share price damage, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers. "Given the easy 
comp period, we are currently forecasting a much more modest -3pc for the final quarter this year to E28.70 per 
pax, with our pace of decline lower than company guidance (decline of 7-10pc). However, could Ryanair actually 
record a E30 average fare in Q410 and deliver breakeven yields ahead of expectations (we see it +2pc in the first 
quarter next year)?" asked analyst, Eamonn Hughes. Running a 2-year rolling yield decline, the 13pc yield decline

in Q1 earlier this year and the 7.8pc decline in the previous year, generates a compound 19.8pc decline for the two 
years. Aer Lingus shares rose 2c to E0.64. Reports suggest that the European Commission will next week deliver 
its verdict on the 'rescue aid' for both Anglo Irish and Irish Nationwide. The timeline of the announcement looks to 
have been brought forward to allow the government inject the necessary capital into both banks once the NAMA 
haircuts are known and before their results are released. The verdict next week, if it comes, will likely be an interim 
review ahead of the final announcement later on in the year, according to Goodbody. Shares in AIB rose 7c to 
E1.66, Bank of Ireland gained 4c to E1.36 while Irish Life and Permanent edged down 1c to E3.09.

record a E30 average fare in Q410 and deliver breakeven yields ahead of expectations (we see it +2pc in the first 
quarter next year)?" asked analyst, Eamonn Hughes. Running a 2-year rolling yield decline, the 13pc yield decline

A bout of bargain hunting after Tuesday's gains helped push the ISEQ index marginally lower this morning while 
Portugal's downgrade also hit investor sentiment.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had lost 13.34 points to 3,145.49.
Fitch Ratings cut Portugal's sovereign credit rating by one notch to AA-, citing budgetary under-performance in 
2009 and warning that further under-performance this year and next could cause another downgrade. The change 
underlined concerns that the debt troubles that have afflicted Greece will move to other of the euro zone's weaker 
economies, and it drove European stocks and an already battered single currency lower. Across Europe, the FTSE 
100 index was down 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX fell 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 lost 0.6 percent, while 
Portugal's share benchmark fell 1.8 percent.
Back home, profit takers sent CRH's shares down 37c to E18.70, recouping most of the stock's gains on Tuesday. 
UK building materials group, Wolseley has formally abandoned its previous approach of global expansion through 
acquisition. Its new strategy is to concentrate and invest in the areas where the group is strong and to improve in 
(or exit) the areas where the group is weak or has limited potential. In relation to the latter, these 19 business units 
(out of a total of 41) currently represent almost 20pc of revenues but only 5pc of trading profits. Shares in Grafton

Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has buried the hatchet with British Airways, by heaping praise on its chief executive 
Willie Walsh.
The budget airline chief has said Walsh is handling the strikes by his cabin crew "extraordinarily well".
He said the timing of the crew's action at his airline was "spectacularly stupid", and claimed the strikes were led by 
"a bunch of out of control trade union headbangers" in the Unite union.
It has emerged that Ryanair leased three planes to the British carrier at Gatwick earlier this week and plans to lease 
up to four when the cabin crew strike resumes at the weekend. O'Leary, who once ran an ad denouncing British 
Airways as "Expensive BAstards", was thanked by Willie Walsh last night for his support. O'Leary said the strike at 
BA was "unwarranted and unjust", adding that he was "happy to help BA and its customers". He urged the board of 
BA to "stiffen their spine" and stand up to the strikers, adding further that Willie Walsh was "doing a good job".

Right or wrong, the customer always matters
Right or wrong, the customer always matters

Section: COMMENT; Pg. 11

Byline: Michael Skapinker
Body
It was Henry Gordon Selfridge, founder of London's Selfridges store, who said "the customer is always right". It is 
not the most entertaining quote on the relevant page of the Penguin Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Quotations . 
That belongs to French advertising man Jacques Séguéla, who wrote a book called Don't Tell My Mother I Work in 
Advertising - She Thinks I'm a Piano-player in a Brothel .
But it is Selfridge's quote that has become a business truism. Is it correct? Is the customer always right? The 
question has provoked a debate in the pages of this newspaper, prompted by our recent report that would-be 
drivers of London's black cabs may have to attend mandatory classes in customer service, as well as passing "The 
Knowledge", the famous test of the city's lay-out. The classes will focus on welcoming passengers, dealing with 
disabled customers and, in a business famous for its opinionated talkers, "knowing when to shut up".
The news prompted a sharp letter from Brett Self of Birmingham, Alabama. "For generations people were taught 
that 'the customer is always right'. This axiom is always wrong . . . However, [suggestions that] the customer is 
'king', 'number one', 'the boss' and - my new favourite - 'the reason we're here' continue to spread their tentacles 
through the banal mentality of management in our modern, worldwide service industry," he wrote.
There are business leaders who agree. In his memoirs, Gordon Bethune, one-time chief executive of Continental 
Airlines of the US, had a section headed "The customer is not always right". Michael O'Leary, boss of Ryanair, the 
Irish low-cost airline, recently went further, telling the Financial Times : "The customer's usually wrong."
You would think their customers would have abandoned them for more sympathetic airlines, but they did not. Mr 
Bethune and Mr O'Leary are two of the most successful chief executives of their generation. Mr Bethune - whose 
book was called From Worst to First - rescued Continental from what had seemed like a terminal dive. Mr O'Leary 
leads one of the most successful airlines in aviation history.
Does that mean that not only can you get away with treating your customers badly but that you can thrive on it? No. 
We need to delve a little more deeply.
Right or wrong, the customer always matters
Mr Bethune certainly worried about customer service, particularly Continental's appalling punctuality record. He told 
staff that every month Continental was in the US top five for on-time arrivals, each employee would receive a $65 
cash bonus.
It was not that Mr Bethune did not understand the importance of happy customers. It was that he knew only 
committed staff would provide the service that would keep them happy. If, in spite of all its efforts, the airline failed 
to perform and a customer became aggressive with an employee, Mr Bethune would always back the employee. 
Why? Because he thought employees would do more for customers if they thought their managers were on their 
side.
Mr O'Leary is more complicated. He seems to go out of his way to antagonise customers, once even threatening to 
charge them to use the toilet. He told this newspaper he did it all for the publicity. The airline spends little on 
advertising.
Mr O'Leary is offering his customers one thing: cheap flights. That, based on Mr O'Leary's relentless drive to cut 
costs, is the airline's central attraction. By constantly telling customers how little he cares about them, Mr O'Leary 
encourages them to concentrate on price alone - and lowers their expectation of receiving anything else. That the 
service is often quite cheerful then seems a bonus. The moment Ryanair's flights become as expensive as a 
traditional airline's, the customers will desert, and Mr O'Leary knows it.
You need to know who your customers are and what you are offering them. If it is rock-bottom prices, you need to 
be cheaper than anyone else. If it is a glitzy department store, glitz is what you have to provide.
And London cab drivers? Their customers never went to them because they cared about their opinions. They went 
to them because they were licensed, safe and knew their way around. The problem is that other providers, minicab 
drivers, can now get licences too, and satellite navigation devices have made "The Knowledge" less of a draw. I am 
not sure customer service lessons will solve the problem. The black cab drivers need to think what else they can 
offer: being around when people leave theatres and pubs perhaps, or even cutting prices.
Customers may not always be right, but they certainly matter. Unless you can give them what your competitors 
cannot, you have no business.

The British Airways strike has achieved one remarkable thing: supportive noises from arch-rival Ryanair. No doubt 
BA's leasing of three Ryanair aircraft accounts for it, but barely a month ago Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's boss, 
warned the BA board had "no spine, no balls and no vision" and would "wimp out" rather than allow a strike.

The main Dublin shares index fell sharply this morning amid ongoing worries over Greece and as the long-awaited 
restructuring of the Irish banking system looms next week.
By 10:00, the ISEQ had fallen by 31.09 points to 3,092.40.
European shares slipped for a third day on Monday, with drugmakers down after the House of Representatives 
approved an overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system, while renewed worries over Greece hurt banks.
At home, bank shares plunged as the Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan is expected to reveal the extent of the 
additional capital requirements for Irish-owned banks a week from tomorrow. It is understood that the Minister will 
also give an up to date picture of the discounts that the banks will take on transferring their property loans to the 
National Asset Management Agency. Sources indicated yesterday that the first loans could be transferred to Nama 
as soon as Friday this week. These will relate to the top 10 borrowers and involve about 1,000 loans with a 
combined value of 17bn euro. Bank of Ireland, EBS and Irish Nationwide received their draft acquisition schedules 
from Nama late last week and have been given until tomorrow to dispute any details in the documentation. Shares 
in AIB dived by 10c to E1.47, Bank of Ireland dropped 6c to 1.23 while Irish Life and Permanent stayed flat at 
E3.00. CRH's stocks fell by 29c to E18.59. Global cement demand has bottomed, Davy Research noted today. 
Analyst, Tim Cahill forecasts global excess capacity to rise from 680mt (metric tonnes) at December 2009 (China 
115mt) to 1.2bn tonnes at December 2012 (China 400mt); this, he said, will drive sea-borne trade from 85mt in 
2009 to 240mt in 2012. Q1 2010 is a "lost quarter" for US and Europe, with volumes -20-40pc. "Worryingly, prices 
are rolling over in the US and parts of Europe (UK, Spain, Italy) as well as in some emerging markets. We favour 
emerging markets over developed (although US stimulus will drive growth) and prefer Asia and Latin America over 
Africa/Middle East. There is massive excess capacity in Saudi, Iran, Pakistan; imports will drive prices lower in 
Greece, looming NAMA weigh on ISEQ; ISEQ Falls
Africa." British Airways cabin crew have begun their third day of strike action as airline management and union 
leaders continue their war of words. Shares in Aer Lingus gained 1c to E0.60 while Ryanair slipped 4c to E3.47.

How an orphanage became home

Stephen Jenkinson is keen to hammer home the fact that he is no superman. The country director for the Umbrella 
Foundation in Nepal consistently stresses that he works as part of a team.
''I did an interview recently, and it came across as though I did everything myself. It was a little embarrassing," he 
says.
The modest 26-year-old is loath to be held up as a poster boy for volunteering, but it is hard not be impressed by 
someone who waved goodbye to the corporate world in favour of running an orphanage in the foothills of the 
Himalayas.
Jenkinson, who worked for Ryanair and Merrill Lynch after he left college, says he always wanted to volunteer.
''I didn't know whether it was something I needed to get off my chest, or something more. A friend of mine came 
back from Nepal, and I decided to go over and volunteer at an orphanage for six months.
I didn't realise it was going to be a career move," he says.
After his stint as a volunteer came to an end in 2008, he travelled onto south-east Asia and Australia, and was in 
Melbourne when he received a call that brought him back to Nepal.
''I had been in touch with Umbrella while I was in Nepal, and when I was in Australia I got a call from them to say 
that they badly needed help. I had planned to stay in Melbourne for another year or two, but they asked me to come 
back," he says.
Jenkinson booked a flight back to Kathmandu and, in January last year, took over the running of an orphanage 
managed by the Umbrella Foundation.
How an orphanage became home
Together with two other Irish volunteers - Conor Fox and Amy Mulcahy - Jenkinson supervises the Nepal operation, 
where 332 children are housed in eight homes.
Many of the children were orphaned, trafficked, displaced during the civil war or simply abandoned. Some were 
struggling to survive on the streets, while others were confined to domestic slavery or living in abusive and 
neglectful homes in the Kathmandu Valley.
The Umbrella Foundation rescues these children, who are aged five and over, and provides them with food, 
housing and access to education. It pays for their lessons at an English-speaking school, and also pays college 
fees for a number of students in their late teens.
This emphasis on education is vital, as it helps the children find employment and become self-sufficient in later life.
As it is a relatively recent startup, just two children have so far left the orphanage. Interestingly, both chose to work 
with the street children of Kathmandu - one runs a children's home and the other runs a scheme that incentivises 
rag pickers tog o to school.
Jenkinson says the work is stressful, but hugely rewarding. ''The hours are long, but you can see why you are 
working," he says.
''My day can range from disciplining a boy and effectively acting as a headmaster, to looking after the finances. It's 
a big organisation, with 50 to 60 staff. We are trying to open a Montessori school and renovate three or four 
buildings, and we also have all the issues that come with running eight homes. Your work is never done, and it can 
be draining."
It goes without saying that money is tight for the volunteers.
''We get enough to get by; that's fine when you're in your mid-20s, but probably not if you have a family or a 
significant other," says Jenkinson.
The toughest part of his job is having to turn children in need away. ''It is really difficult, but we have to do it 
regularly because we are full to capacity. You would have to be made of stone for that not to affect you," he says.
Jenkinson says it can be difficult to switch off completely. He has Saturdays off but, as he spends so much of the 
week in the office, he tends to spend Saturdays doing activities with the children.
''Every one of them is a little personality, and they all have their own story, so it's great to get to know them better. 
They are amazing kids.
They are always in good form and never complain or cause trouble. I think it is important to get to know them, as we 
work long hours and spending time with them reminds us why we do it," he says.
''Of course, at times you just have to get away from it and not think or speak about Umbrella, and during those 
times we usually watch a movie or head to a restaurant and just chill out. We're very lucky in that myself, Conor and 
Amy get on very well together.
We also have a constant stream of volunteers from all over who stay for a minimum of three months, so it's always 
good craic to head out with them for a few beers at the weekend."
Jenkinson says the type of volunteer applying to work with Umbrella is very different today to what it was a few 
years ago. In the past, volunteers were mainly college students on a gap year. Today, they are much more likely to 
be professionals taking a career break or wanting to use their skills during the downturn.
Umbrella is funded by private donations, and the bulk of the charity's revenue comes from people who sponsor a 
child for about  35 a month. ''Fundraising has become more difficult with the recession and, obviously, Haiti is 
getting a lot of attention right now - and rightly so," Jenkinson says.
How an orphanage became home
Umbrella recently established a fundraising committee in Ireland which has alleviated some of the financial 
pressure. Ireland rugby star Jamie Heaslip also agreed to come on board as Umbrella's patron.
Jenkinson says he is often asked whether he finds it tough to relate to the difficulties faced by friends and family 
back home.
''Some people almost feel guilty, and sometimes apologise for having a problem when we're chatting, thinking that I 
might judge them or something, which is crazy. Problems are always relative," he says.
That said, he acknowledges that living in a developing country like Nepal has given him a very different perspective 
on life.
''People are always going to have complaints and problems - that's normal, and I like to have a moan as much as 
the next person. I think the important thing is to get a balance and take a little time to appreciate the positives. I 
don't think Irish people do that often enough," he says.
''I'm well aware that the country has changed a lot since I left three years ago, and there are probably lots of 
reasons for complaining, but it's important to remember at the end of the day just how lucky we are.
''When you see how some people here live, and how some children realise from an early age that they will never 
have the love that comes from being part of a family, it does get a little annoying when you feel people at home are 
so quick to complain."
What began as a six-month stint looks set to become a life-long career for the Dubliner.
''I plan to stay in this line of work, or in a related field. The work is very rewarding, and I get a lot of pleasure out of 
it," he says. ''I don't know whether I will necessarily be country director in ten years' time, but I will always have a 
huge bond with Nepal and Umbrella."

How do I find out whether my BA flight will take off? Go to British Airways' website, www.ba.com . The home page 
has a section called Cabin Crew Strike that shows all the latest flight information.
Enter your destination or flight number and you should be able to see if the flight is cancelled, running normally, 
going at a different time, or operated by one of the airlines from which BA has chartered aircraft or bought seats for 
the strike.
If you don't have a computer, call 0844 493 0787 between 6am and 8pm. BA may also try to send you updates by 
text or e-mail, if you give them your details.
My flight is cancelled. What should I do next?
Book another flight, find another route or get a refund. BA will repay whatever the ticket cost or try to get you on 
another flight to a nearby destination, or book you another BA flight - if you dare.
What if the strike is called off over the weekend?
Again, go to the BA website. If the airline is able to reinstate flights, this is where it will put up the information first. 
Even if the strike is halted, it may have to stick with much of the schedule it has now, meaning no flights to South 
America or cities ranging from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Lagos and Johannesburg.
I've looked at www.ba.com and it says my Heathrow flight to Rome is still going but it is being operated by 
something called Titan Airways. Should I be worried?
No. Everyone from Gordon Brown to the England football team has flown on this VIP airline, which describes itself 
as "the UK's most prestigious charter airline" with "superb in-flight service".
Titan is one of 11 airlines providing stand-in aircraft for the first three days of the strike, all of which BA says must 
comply with strict UK and European safety standards. And one of which is Ryanair.
I'm flying business class but the charter airline BA is flying has no business class cabin. What do I do?
Passengers redirected to website for updates Q&ATravel advice
BA says passengers on some shorter European flights may find themselves in this situation. If so, it will pay them 
"downgrade compensation" and a partial refund, and try to seat them at the front of the aircraft.
I'm due to fly during the second strike period, due to last four days from March 27 but BA hasn't said what is 
happening then. What should I do?
The airline says it will publish a schedule online as soon as possible for that period but cannot do so at the moment.
What about the days next week in between the two strike periods? Will they be affected?
British Airways says there may be some effect on the schedule but it is impossible to say how much at this point. 
Again, it's best to check the website.

BA refuses to be grounded as union ignores call by Brown to halt strike

Thousands of British Airways passengers will today find themselves boarding unfamiliar aircraft from carriers 
including no-frills Ryanair and Air Finland as British Airways mounts a huge operation to cope with its first strike in 
13 years.
The Unite union representing over 12,000 BA cabin crew defied calls from Gordon Brown to halt the strike and was 
due to press ahead with three days of industrial action from midnight. Last-minute talks in London to try to reach a 
deal with the airline ended in acrimony yesterday.
The threat of further strikes in the run-up to the expected May general election is a headache for the prime minister. 
The RMT union is considering calling the first national rail strike for 16 years and said signal workers had voted for 
action.
Tony Woodley, Unite's joint leader, said trying to settle with BA had proved "mission impossible". It had been an 
"absolute disgrace" that Willie Walsh, the airline's chief executive, had tabled an offer that contained a worse pay 
deal than that which was offered last week, he said.
"I think this is a classic case of Mr Walsh unfortunately being one of the hawks and looking for a war with our 
members, as opposed to a negotiated settlement," said Mr Woodley.
Mr Walsh denied trying to break the union or avoid a deal. "I've been here for the last three days in direct 
discussions with Tony Woodley," he said, adding he must be "the only chief executive of a FTSE 100 company" to 
have given his mobile phone number to union leaders to try to keep discussions going.
BA believes it will be able to keep 65 per cent of passengers flying thanks to chartered aircraft and 1,000 volunteer 
cabin crew it has trained since it became evident a strike might go ahead over the airline's changes to flight 
attendant working conditions.
BA refuses to be grounded as union ignores call by Brown to halt strike
Ryanair, normally a feisty opponent, sounded more supportive when asked about the three aircraft it was leasing to 
the UK carrier, saying: "BA is in a fight for survival and the last thing they need is strike action from a greedy union, 
which passengers simply won't tolerate."
Downing Street said: "The prime minister believes that this strike is in no one's interest and will cause unacceptable 
inconvenience to passengers. He urges the strike be called off immediately."
David Cameron, Tory leader, will today accuse Mr Brown of being "terrified of upsetting the union barons" who are 
"bankrolling the Labour party".

Gapper blog (Jonathan Guthrie): A bust-up between British Airways and trades unionists is a top business story 
in the UK. What makes the dispute interesting for journalists is its political dimension. The ruling Labour party and 
the opposition Conservatives are neck-and-neck in the polls as they head towards an anticipated May 6 general 
election. Looming strikes, and ministers' responses to them, are therefore seen as potentially swaying voters.
Crucially, hard-nosed BA chief executive Willie Walsh is slugging it out with the Unite union, an important Labour 
donor. Charlie Whelan, political officer of Unite, is also an adviser to prime minister Gordon Brown, who formerly 
employed him as his PR man.
These links have unpleasant resonances for older Britons. They remember the horrors of Labour government in the 
late 1970s. Then, prime minister "Sunny" Jim Callaghan failed to control trades unionists in state-controlled 
industries and the public services. The country nearly ground to a halt. That paved the way to a Tory election 
landslide in 1979 and a curbing of union power by the victorious Margaret Thatcher.
However, the historic parallels are weaker than the frothier end of the rightwing press would like.
First, BA's benefits and staffing policies are a matter for its management and workers, not the government.
Second, the past decade has proved just how modest union influence on Labour has become. Victories such as the 
introduction of a minimum wage have been balanced by such setbacks as the government's resistance to European 
Union requests for a maximum working week.
Ministers have distanced themselves from the compromising influence of unions during the BA dispute - which 
broadly concerns a cost-cutting programme - as they have throughout the New Labour years. The Tories will treat 
big business as coolly, for similar reasons, if it wins an election.
Moreover, a BA strike would impinge very little on the majority of voters. That is because they fly on low-cost 
airlines such as the all-conquering Ryanair. BA is seen by some as too expensive and too stuffy. That is BA's whole 
problem. The threatened industrial action would mostly affect better-off tourists and business people travelling on 
expenses, who typically vote Tory as a matter of course.

Highlight: Cheltenham hit by Dublin recession
Body
Organisers of the Cheltenham festival, who have for several years seen a fall in the number of Irish racegoers 
attending the event, now have an added worry: a growing list of Irish-based companies no longer willing to sponsor 
races.
The four-day festival, which begins today, draws not just a sizeable contingent of Irish-trained horses but a big 
following of Irish punters, made up of visitors crossing the Irish Sea and those living in England.
But the Irish economy's problems are having an impact on the so-called "Irish invasion" of punters and corporate 
backers patronising the biggest gathering in the jump racing calendar.
The Irish presence provides the festival with much of its colour and atmosphere. But the Irish recession had seen 
the numbers of racegoers travelling from Ireland for last year's festival fall by a third, said Edward Gillespie, 
managing director of the festival, and this year's numbers were likely to be no better.
"There is no doubt that the Irish economy has had a very negative effect on their ability to come and be as gleeful 
as they used to be," Mr Gillespie said.
Ryanair is running 50 return flights from Ireland to airports within reasonable distance of the Gloucestershire 
racecourse. But although these numbers are slightly up on last year, they are significantly down on two years ago.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said the days of Irish racegoers taking time off to attend the whole 
festival were long gone. "You generally find more people making a two-day stop," he said. "You need to be fit, rich 
and deranged to go the whole week."
Cheltenham has relied on financial services and construction and property companies for sponsorship and 
corporate hospitality income, but the recession has hit Irish businesses in these sectors and organisers are seeking 
new clients.
Irish absence makes the going tough
Anglo Irish Bank was a strong backer but withdrew two years ago. Smurfit Kappa, the Dublin-based corrugated 
packaging manufacturer, last week announced the end of its 20-year sponsorship of the Champion Hurdle, and 
Ballymore Properties had already withdrawn backing.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair's long-running race sponsorship would probably end in 2012 when its deal expired.
Peter McNeile, Cheltenham's sponsorship director, said the festival would be seeking future sponsors among a 
more diverse group of companies, and was in talks with Wrigley's and Waitrose.
Even so, sponsorship from Irish-based companies was broadly the same as in 2007. "I wouldn't say the trend was 
downward but at best static," Mr McNeile said.
Cheltenham's response to a fall in demand for corporate hospitality - which contributed to a 12 per cent reduction in 
revenues last year - has been to reduce capacity in order to ensure occupancy levels are high.
As for overall attendance numbers, Mr Gillespie is expecting them to be about the same as last year. "Certainly, 
there are no more people travelling from Ireland," he said.

Highlight: Air France has let fly at Ryanair over subsidies, accusing its low-cost Irish rival of pressuring regional 
authorities to give unfair support as the price of it using their airports.
Body
Air France has let fly at Ryanair over subsidies, accusing its low-cost Irish rival of pressuring regional authorities to 
give unfair support as the price of it using their airports.
Air France said it had complained to the European Commission about what it described as "open-ended subsidies" 
in the form of discounts, preferential treatment and marketing help from regional airports in violation of European 
rules.
Air France alleges that Ryanair now receives E660m in public funds from local authorities in Europe each year, 
including E35m in France.
In a blistering attack on Ryanair, it said that, far from making a profit in 2008 and a small loss last year, the Paris-
based airline insists that Ryanair made a huge de facto loss in both years. It claims that this loss was disguised by 
allegedly illegal public subsidies. "The Irish airline purports to be the Robin Hood airline which offers unbeatably low 
prices, compared to the inflated prices of national carriers," a senior Air France official said yesterday. "In fact, 
Ryanair is only flying thanks to taxpayers' money." The Irish airline hit back, saying it had not received any such 
state aid whereas Air France had and that its complaint was just "sour grapes". "We pay no attention to false claims 
from high-fares, fuel- surcharging airlines like Air France. They can't compete with Ryanair, so they complain 
instead. Ryanair is investing millions in regional French airport whereas Air France ignores them," Ryanair 
spokesman Stephen McNamara said. Air France said it had filed a formal, written complaint to the European 
Commission at the end of last November. The airline, part of the Air France-KLM group, said in a statement that, 
not only had Ryanair received unfair help in exchange for using regional airports, but had done so on the back of 
traditional carriers such as Air France. "The aid obtained by Ryanair is often financed by the proceeds of landing 
fees paid by other airlines operating at those airports," the now fully privatised French airline said. "In practice, 
Ryanair is flying with the money of European taxpayers," it said. Ryanair has survived previous EU challenges to

the "contributions" that it demands from local or regional councils for flying to regional airports. Michel Boutant, the 
president of the Charente council in western France, complained in December that Ryanair had asked for an 
additional E175,000 in "marketing" payments to continue its flights from London to Angouleme this year. He 
accused the Irish airline of "blackmail." Air France said that Ryanair receives payments from Marseille and Nice 
airports, both of which are international hubs and neither of which is small.

accused the Irish airline of "blackmail." Air France said that Ryanair receives payments from Marseille and Nice 
airports, both of which are international hubs and neither of which is small.

Timely move into and out of high risk aids quick rebound
Timely move into and out of high risk aids quick rebound

Highlight: Fund focus
Invesco Perpetual's European Smaller Companies fund has picked up well since 2008, says Cherry Reynard
Body
The year of 2008 was one most European smaller companies managers would rather forget and Adrian Bignell, 
manager of the Invesco Perpetual European Smaller Companies fund, is no exception.
The fund was over-exposed to riskier assets in the liquidity squeeze and saw performance slide.
However, it had been a consistent outperformer since Mr Bignell took over management in 2004, and has bounced 
back with the market recovery.
The fund has no specific focus on growth or value and aims to make money out of either type of stock, so long as it 
is undiscovered by the market.
Mr Bignell says: "You need to be holistic and rounded. We love the high quality companies that deliver 15 per cent 
earnings growth per year but, for the most part, that will tend to be priced in so you need to look for turnaround 
stories as well."
He sees himself as a natural contrarian and says he tends to be early to buy and sell.
He believes the fund should be "all-weather", rather than doing well in one type of market over another.
He says smaller companies tend to have simpler business models and are largely easier to understand than large-
cap conglomerates.
The macro analysis will look at the business cycle and assess the most appropriate sectors for each stage, which 
also informs the country bias.
Mr Bignell adds: "Norway, for example, is more exposed to oil and commodities.
"Germany is focused on capital goods and chemicals and then the euro is a strong determinant for exports.
Timely move into and out of high risk aids quick rebound
"Spain is about utilities and banks."
The fund is in positive territory so far this year, and had a good 2009, outperforming the market by 6.4 percentage 
points.
But 2008 saw the fund fall 53.7 per cent, compared with a 35.4 per cent decline for the HSBC European Smaller 
Companies ex UK index.
The pick-up in 2009 came from a timely move into - and back out of - higher-risk areas.
Mr Bignell says: "Last year we started buying into cyclicals and financials in the first and second quarter, which 
stood us in good stead for the rally. At this point, no one wanted to touch these areas and many of the stocks were 
priced as if they would go bust. We also did well at the end of the year, when our macro analysis ensured we 
rotated back into defensive areas."
Mr Bignell is maintaining his defensive tilt, looking for quality growth and winners in individual industries, such as 
Ryanair, which is benefiting from the disintegration of its rivals.
He says industries such as airlines are consolidating; weaker companies are being forced out - either losing so 
much money they cannot afford to compete on price, or being taken out by companies attracted by the low cost of 
debt.

Body
The Federal Aviation Administration has issued an emergency airworthiness directive demanding that airlines check 
a mechanism that controls tail flaps on about 600 Boeing 737s.
The directive was issued Friday and concerns flaps on the horizontal tails of the jets. On March 2, a Ryanair 737-
800 en route from the Netherlands to Madrid, Spain, experienced severe vibrations in flight and had to make an 
unscheduled landing in Belgium.
Inspection afterward found "extensive damage" to the left elevator, which is a movable flap on the horizontal tail that 
controls the pitch of the airplane, up or down.
The agency says some of the jets must be inspected within 12 days, and the rest within 30 days. FAA spokesman 
Allen Kenitzer said about half the affected airplanes are operating in the U.S.

British Airways staff have voted to strike over a long-running dispute with the troubled flag carrier.
"Good Morning. Welcome to scheduled flight BA01789 from London Heathrow to New York JFK. This is your 
captain, Charles Suave, speaking. We are currently travelling at a speed of zero knots and an altitude of no feet 
whatsoever above the ground.
"You may think that the aircraft has been sitting motionless on the tarmac for hours because we have been awaiting 
a take-off slot. We haven't. The crew are holding a union meeting.
"That gives me time to fill you in on what you can see from the windows. Passengers on the left have a fine view of 
the main runway. Notice how many aircraft operated by low-cost carriers are taking off and landing.
"Passengers on the right can see the offices of British Airways. If you really strain your eyes, you may even glimpse 
a tiny figure in a corner office jumping up and down and tearing his hair out. That's Willie Walsh, the chief executive.
"Inflight catering today would have been led by senior stewardess Samantha Blusher. But Sam is taking a duvet 
day. She says BA simply isn't the airline that she joined back in '92, what with the understaffing, the pay freeze and 
the expenses cuts. If you're getting peckish, try asking fellow passengers to share their boiled sweets.
"Now, co-pilot Henry Dashing, who is also the shop steward, has just given me an update. It's one out, all out, 
apparently. So I'll just radio for a bus to take you back to the terminal. It only remains to me to wish you well with 
your onward journeys. Ryanair is a good bet, in my experience. Thank you for trying to fly BA. Not enough people 
do these days. And that's the whole problem."

Aer Lingus to cut 670 jobs in cost-cutting plan

Body
Irish airline Aer Lingus announced Tuesday it will cut 670 jobs as part of its long-postponed plan to slash more than 
(EURO)90 million ($125 million) from annual operating costs and keep the business from facing bankruptcy or 
takeover.
Chief executive officer Christoph Mueller announced the cuts after unions representing the 3,500-strong work force 
completed balloting on whether to accept the airline's cutbacks, which were proposed last year.
Four unions representing pilots, maintenance, craft and administration staff accepted the plans, which include 10 
percent pay cuts for many workers. But the union representing cabin crews rejected the terms on offer and Mueller 
warned they could face even sharper cuts in response.
"Someone who votes `no' to a proposition should not get an easier way out than the ones who have voted in favor," 
said Mueller, a German airline executive who took charge of Ireland's flag carrier last year. He added, however, that 
"retaliation is not our business."
He said 230 cabin-crew employees would be fired, while 440 workers in the other sectors would receive generous 
compensation packages for voluntarily quitting.
He said cabin-crew workers being laid off would get "no sweetheart deal," but confirmed the company would 
negotiate layoff terms with the cabin crews' union, Impact.
Earlier Tuesday, Aer Lingus postponed publication of its annual results because of the uncertainty overhanging its 
cost-cutting plans. It did release a trading statement that documented the company's soaring losses in 2009.
Aer Lingus said sales fell 11 percent to (EURO)1.2 billion, chiefly because of heavy discounting of fares. It recorded 
an operating loss of (EURO)81 million versus (EURO)20 million in 2008. The airline offered no net figures.
Europe's major budget carrier Ryanair, already the largest Aer Lingus shareholder with a 30 percent stake, expects 
eventually to acquire its smaller Irish rival. But Aer Lingus which inherited healthy cash reserves when the 
government privatized it in 2007 still has (EURO)335 million in net cash, barely half of its 2008 level.

Ryanair today said that the 500 engineering jobs it had allegedly earmarked for Dublin Airport's Hangar Six have 
now gone to Glasgow Prestwick and one other European airport.
The no-frills airline said the investment offer was "ignored" because the Govt didn't want to "upset the DAA 
monopoly".
"Aer Lingus has now moved into H6, but instead of creating jobs Aer Lingus will shortly cut 900 more jobs at Dublin 
Airport," it said.
Ryanair confirmed that it will now finalise a deal with another European Govt/airport, adding that it believes it is a 
damming indictment of the current Irish Govt that one of Ireland's few world leading companies has not been 
encouraged, or assisted, to secure these 500 engineering jobs here in Ireland. "It is clear that this Govt is incapable 
of maintaining or creating jobs. Its failure last year to encourage the world's largest international airline to create up 
to 500 engineering jobs in Hangar 6 at Dublin Airport is typical of its indecision and incompetence. The refusal to 
sell or lease Hangar 6 to Ryanair in 2009 proves that this Govt prefers to protect the DAA monopoly who 
subsequently allowed Aer Lingus to move into the facility, an airline with no heavy maintenance in Ireland and no 
use for such a large hangar, and which is cutting up to 900 jobs. Ryanair will now move to finalise a deal with one of 
the other European Govts and airports who are interested in securing these engineering jobs and are working with 
Ryanair to sustain investment and jobs at their airports instead of waffling on about the "complexities" and "barriers" 
to job creation like Ireland's dithering and incompetent Govt," said Ryanair's Stephen McNamara.

The main Dublin shares index dropped sharply this morning after Monday's rebound as investors took their profits 
from banking stocks.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 34.16 points to 2,981.68.
Shares in AIB fell by 5c to E1.29, Bank of Ireland dropped 7c to E1.09 and Irish Life and Permanent declined by 9c 
to E3.05. Investors in the banks pocketed gains this morning after significant buying at the end of last week on 
hopes that AIB may not fall in to State majority ownership if it sells its US, UK and Polish assets. Shares in AIB fell 
5c to E1.39, Bank of Ireland declined 5c to E1.16 and Irish Life and Permanent fell 7c to E3.16. A recapitalisation of 
permanent tsb, the banking arm of Irish Life and Permanent group would greatly enhance the value of its life 
assurance business with a rights issue the most likely method, according to a report from Merrion Stockbrokers. It 
said that it expects the group to post an operating loss of E93m in 2010 (a drop of E69m compared to 2009) before 
a return to operating profit of E133m in 2011. "Despite the revisions and recognising the bank needs to be 
recapitalised, we remain of the view that IL and P is undervalued. We expect existing shareholders to be able to 
participate in the recapitalisation, which, while diluting returns, maintains investors' proportionate interests," the note 
said. 
It estimates the bank to achieve an 8pc equity tier I capital ratio on a standalone basis at E800m.
Shares in Aer Lingus gained 2c to E0.62 after it reported an operating loss of E81m for 2009, a fourfold increase 
from the losses of E20m reported in 2008. Revenues fell by 11pc to just over E1.2 billion from E1.36 billion. The 
airline said that a strong performance in ancillary revenues was offset by reduced passenger fare and cargo 
revenue. The airline this morning published an unaudited trading update for last year after delaying the publication

savings. Shares in rival Ryanair fell 9c to E3.43. Shares in Bookies, Paddy Power, fell 5c to E23.55. Centrebet saw 
its share price rise by 10pc in Australia following the company's announcement that it has received an expression of 
interest in a possible acquisition from a number of parties. This announcement should not have come as a huge 
surprise, as in January Centrebet's major shareholder, the Kafataris family (about 60pc) noted in a press article that 
it was open to Centrebet being acquired. Paddy Power entered the Australian market in May 2009 through the 
acquisition of 51pc (subsequently increased to around 61pc) of Sportsbet, which in turn acquired IAS. Shares in 
Independent News and Media rose 1c to E0.09 after it announced that it has disposed of 7.8pc of its 13.5pc stake 
in Jagran Prakashan (JPL). The proceeds generated from this move amounts to E42m (a healthy 47pc return on its 
investment four years ago), which will be used to pay down the group's sizeable bank debt. Irish Continental Group 
will report its full-year results on March 23rd. Davy expect EBITDA to trough in 2009 at E49m, down from E66m in 
2008. The broker assumes revenue of E285.4m, down 16.8pc, and earnings per share of 83c. "We expect a good 
recovery in car volumes for the market, and ICG in particular, with the 2009 numbers likely to show growth around 
2pc. In freight, we will be looking for stabilisation - industry estimates show a RoRo freight decline of about 13pc in 
2009 (it was down 17pc in H1). Group revenues for the first nine months were E197m (2008: E265.5m), while 
EBITDA was E41.7m (2008: E55.9m)," analyst, Stephen Furlong said. Shares in ICG fell 10c to E14.75.

Independent News and Media rose 1c to E0.09 after it announced that it has disposed of 7.8pc of its 13.5pc stake

investment four years ago), which will be used to pay down the group's sizeable bank debt. Irish Continental Group

2008. The broker assumes revenue of E285.4m, down 16.8pc, and earnings per share of 83c. "We expect a good 
recovery in car volumes for the market, and ICG in particular, with the 2009 numbers likely to show growth around 
2pc. In freight, we will be looking for stabilisation - industry estimates show a RoRo freight decline of about 13pc in 
2009 (it was down 17pc in H1). Group revenues for the first nine months were E197m (2008: E265.5m), while 
EBITDA was E41.7m (2008: E55.9m)," analyst, Stephen Furlong said. Shares in ICG fell 10c to E14.75.

The main Dublin shares index dropped sharply this morning after Monday's rebound as investors took their profits 
from banking stocks.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 34.16 points to 2,981.68.
Shares in AIB fell by 5c to E1.29, Bank of Ireland dropped 7c to E1.09 and Irish Life and Permanent declined by 9c 
to E3.05. Investors in the banks pocketed gains this morning after significant buying at the end of last week on 
hopes that AIB may not fall in to State majority ownership if it sells its US, UK and Polish assets. Shares in AIB fell 
5c to E1.39, Bank of Ireland declined 5c to E1.16 and Irish Life and Permanent fell 7c to E3.16. A recapitalisation of 
permanent tsb, the banking arm of Irish Life and Permanent group would greatly enhance the value of its life 
assurance business with a rights issue the most likely method, according to a report from Merrion Stockbrokers. It 
said that it expects the group to post an operating loss of E93m in 2010 (a drop of E69m compared to 2009) before 
a return to operating profit of E133m in 2011. "Despite the revisions and recognising the bank needs to be 
recapitalised, we remain of the view that IL and P is undervalued. We expect existing shareholders to be able to 
participate in the recapitalisation, which, while diluting returns, maintains investors' proportionate interests," the note 
said. 
It estimates the bank to achieve an 8pc equity tier I capital ratio on a standalone basis at E800m.
Shares in Aer Lingus gained 2c to E0.62 after it reported an operating loss of E81m for 2009, a fourfold increase 
from the losses of E20m reported in 2008. Revenues fell by 11pc to just over E1.2 billion from E1.36 billion. The 
airline said that a strong performance in ancillary revenues was offset by reduced passenger fare and cargo 
revenue. The airline this morning published an unaudited trading update for last year after delaying the publication

its share price rise by 10pc in Australia following the company's announcement that it has received an expression of 
interest in a possible acquisition from a number of parties. This announcement should not have come as a huge 
surprise, as in January Centrebet's major shareholder, the Kafataris family (about 60pc) noted in a press article that

Aer Lingus will not publish its 2009 earnings tomorrow as planned so it can adjust provisions for cost-cutting 
measures that cabin crew rejected last week.
Confirming what a source told Reuters earlier on Monday, the former state airline said it would not publish full 
results until an unspecified date, and would issue a brief trading update on Tuesday instead.
Aer Lingus, which has fended off two hostile bids by Irish rival Ryanair, wants to reduce its annual operating costs 
by 97 million euros (dollar 133 million) by shedding up to a fifth of staff.
The proposed plan to stop it burning through its cash reserves has been accepted by unions representing pilots, 
middle management and by some ground staff and cabin crew. But cabin crew represented by the IMPACT union 
rejected the plan on Friday, and maintenance staff will only publish the result of their ballot on Tuesday. Aer Lingus 
said it was determined to realise the planned cuts in any case. "These savings are vital to realign the cost base of 
the company and position Aer Lingus for a successful future," it said in a statement. Aer Lingus is expected to 
announce a 2009 operating loss of 87.7 million euros, in-house broker Goodbody said. If it does not get agreement 
from unions, Aer Lingus has said it would push ahead with an alternative plan to streamline the company by 
imposing more redundancies, some on a compulsory basis. "The Company's Board of Directors will meet tomorrow 
to formally approve the steps that will now be taken to achieve these cost savings," it said. Aer Lingus' shares -- of 
which Ryanair, the government and employees control 70 percent between them -- fell 1.6 percent in late trade to 
0.60 euros, reversing earlier gains and trading at less than half the 1.4 euros Ryanair offered in late 2008. Airlines 
are reeling from aviation's worst year on record, during which demand dropped faster than capacity could be 
trimmed, but workers across the industry have lost patience with cost-cutting programmes. Deutsche Lufthansa and 
British Airways have been two of the biggest European carriers hit by strikes this year.

Aer Lingus will not publish its 2009 earnings tomorrow as planned so it can adjust provisions for cost-cutting 
measures that cabin crew rejected last week.
Confirming what a source told Reuters earlier on Monday, the former state airline said it would not publish full 
results until an unspecified date, and would issue a brief trading update on Tuesday instead.
Aer Lingus, which has fended off two hostile bids by Irish rival Ryanair, wants to reduce its annual operating costs 
by 97 million euros (dollar 133 million) by shedding up to a fifth of staff.
The proposed plan to stop it burning through its cash reserves has been accepted by unions representing pilots, 
middle management and by some ground staff and cabin crew. But cabin crew represented by the IMPACT union 
rejected the plan on Friday, and maintenance staff will only publish the result of their ballot on Tuesday. Aer Lingus 
said it was determined to realise the planned cuts in any case. "These savings are vital to realign the cost base of 
the company and position Aer Lingus for a successful future," it said in a statement. Aer Lingus is expected to 
announce a 2009 operating loss of 87.7 million euros, in-house broker Goodbody said. If it does not get agreement 
from unions, Aer Lingus has said it would push ahead with an alternative plan to streamline the company by 
imposing more redundancies, some on a compulsory basis. "The Company's Board of Directors will meet tomorrow 
to formally approve the steps that will now be taken to achieve these cost savings," it said. Aer Lingus' shares -- of 
which Ryanair, the government and employees control 70 percent between them -- fell 1.6 percent in late trade to 
0.60 euros, reversing earlier gains and trading at less than half the 1.4 euros Ryanair offered in late 2008. Airlines 
are reeling from aviation's worst year on record, during which demand dropped faster than capacity could be 
trimmed, but workers across the industry have lost patience with cost-cutting programmes. Deutsche Lufthansa and

Ireland plans automatic pension scheme enrolment
Ireland plans automatic pension scheme enrolment

Highlight: Private sector
The government faces a pensions time-bomb, writes John Murray Brown
Body
Ireland has adopted an idea from behavioural economics to tackle the problem of private sector pension coverage, 
with reforms announced last week that will see low and middle income workers automatically enrolled in a pension 
scheme.
Pete Lund, an economist at Dublin's Economic and Social Research Institute, says auto enrolment is an example of 
the default option - a concept borrowed from behavioural economics, but now familiar across businesses from the 
way the French and Germans donate organs to Ryanair's policy on travel insurance on its website.
In the pensions industry it is now common in US private sector retirement savings schemes. At government level 
the model has been used in New Zealand's Kiwisaver , and is to be introduced in the UK with the National 
Employment Savings Trust (Nest) product, a national workplace scheme expected to be rolled out from 2012.
Under the Irish plan, all workers over 22 who are not in an existing plan will be automatically enrolled, and will have 
to contribute 4 per cent of their salary to a scheme. They are free to opt out after three months. However, they will 
be reenrolled every two years.
Employers will have to make a mandatory contribution of EUR1 for every EUR2 set aside by the worker. The state 
too will contribute EUR1, equivalent to tax relief at 33 per cent. This replaces the current system where those in 
pension plans enjoy relief at the marginal tax rates, either 20 or 41 per cent.
The aim is to address Ireland's looming pensions time-bomb. The country will see the number of pensioners treble 
by 2050, with the cost of state pensions rising from 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product today to 15.5 per cent.
Private sector pensions have been ravaged by the global financial crisis. The vast bulk of Ireland's defined benefit 
schemes, covering around 500,000 workers, no longer meet the minimum solvency standard set by the Irish 
pensions regulator, with industry forecasts that 40 per cent will be forced to close.
Ireland plans automatic pension scheme enrolment
However, the thrust of the latest reform is targeted at those who have no private pension cover, relying solely on the 
basic state pension to see them through retirement. This group accounts for half the working population. The 
problem is particularly acute among younger people, with 63 per cent of those under the age of 30 having no plan.
Michael Madden, actuarial partner at Mercer in Dublin, says the product will be no different from an employer 
sponsored plan, although he suggested the mandatory nature of the scheme "places a greater onus of care on the 
government".
He points out that although the government says there is no guarantee of the investment returns, the scheme will 
be administered by the state, with the money collected via the Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) system, 
Ireland's social insurance system.
Most analysts agree the scheme should result in increased coverage, but some question whether it will meet the 
adequacy test. The investment assumptions are seen as too optimistic. The government calculates the scheme will 
provide a worker on EUR30,000 (£27,000, $41,000) with a pension equivalent to 58 per cent of salary.
In the past, opposition from the finance department has been the stumbling block to pension reform. But it was 
significant that Mary Hanafin, the family and social affairs minister was accompanied at last Wednesday's press 
conference by both Brian Cowen, the Taoiseach (the Irish prime minister) and Brian Lenihan, the finance minister.
However all three ministers stress the reforms will only take effect when economic conditions allow and not before 
2014 at the earliest. The concern is that to administer the changes now would not only put additional costs on 
business but could stoke wage inflation at a time when the government is endeavouring to restrain wages to restore 
Ireland's export competitiveness.

The ISEQ moved out of the Doldrums led by an impressive 15pc surge in Grafton's shares after its results came in 
better than the market had expected.
The index rose 25.37 points to 2,965.40.
Europe's markets were helped by the ECB's decision to hold rates at their record 1pc low. The central bank for the 
eurozone took a small step towards unwinding its extraordinary support for the euro zone economy today, but it 
forecast a fragile recovery and left much of its cash buffer for banks in place. The ECB said it would return next 
month to competitive tenders for three-month loans to banks, a sign that it is more comfortable with money market 
conditions and the latest stage in a gradual withdrawal of billions pumped into banks in the worst days of the 
financial crisis in 2008.
Shares in the Dublin-based DIY retailer group dominated the index, climbing 39c to E2.84 as its results for 2009 
came in comfortably better than expected by brokers and indicated that the group looks to be over the worst. The 
results contained what Davy called "excellent news in relation to margin and debt management". Elsewhere in the 
sector, CRH rose 16c to E16.98 and Kingspan gained 1c to E5.81. Banks also rebounded after a torrid week that 
saw the Big Two drop below the E1 a share mark. Shares in AIB jumped 14c to E1.18 amid hopes that it can - 
through asset sales or even a rights issue - avoid a Government majority shareholding. Bank of Ireland's stock 
climbed 10c to E1.10 and Irish Life and Permanent was up 5c to E3.03. The Central Bank has published arrears 
levels for owner-occupied mortgages at the end of 2009. Using case numbers as opposed to value of arrears as a 
base, the statistics reveal that 3.6pc of Irish owner-occupied mortgages were 90 days past due at the end of 
December, up from 3.3pc at the end of September. Both AIB and IL and P have published their end-2009 figures. IL 
and P's cases in arrears over 90 days, including buy-to-let mortgages, were running at 3.9pc at the end of 2009 
(versus 3.3pc at end June). AIB discloses the value of mortgages in arrears as opposed to cases. At the end of

2009, its 90 days-plus arrears, including impaired mortgages, were running at less than 2pc. "All the evidence 
points to some stability in arrears levels in the fourth quarter, but it is too early to call the peak," said analyst, Emer 
Lang. Ryanair has published February passenger statistics showing a 6pc rise in the month, though loads were 
down 3 percentage points to 75pc. After 9pc growth in January and loads up 1pc, the February figures are initially a 
little disappointing. Having said that, we note that loads in FY08 were 75pc in February, so maybe last year's figure 
was a little high. The no-frills airline's shares dipped 6c to E3.46. Aviva reported 2009 results providing some detail 
on its Irish general insurance business. The company reports in sterling and the Irish performance would be worse 
in euro terms. Net written premium declined 14.6pc on an annual basis in 2009 in sterling terms (8.7pc decline in 
the first half). Dublin-listed insurer, FBD, saw its shares rise 15c to E5.75.

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet plc (EZJ.L) Thursday said its load factor for the month of February declined 
1.7% from the previous year, while the number of passengers carried in the month increased over 12%.
Load factor, or the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available, in the just concluded 
month slipped 1.7% points to 85.3% from 87.0%. In January, load factor had increased 3.6% points to 79.3% from 
75.7% in January, 2009.
In February, the airline's passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, grew 12.3% to 3.39 million 
from 3.02 million in the same month last year. Number of passengers increased 10.7% in January to 3.14 million 
from 2.84 million in the prior-year month.
The company noted that earned seats include seats that are flown whether the passenger turns up or not, as well 
as seats provided for promotional purposes and to staff for business travel.
For the rolling twelve months ended February 2010, load factor rose 1% point to 86.1% from 85.1%. Number of 
Passengers increased 5.2% to 46.75 million from 44.44 million.
Among peers, Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said Wednesday that its February 2010 passenger traffic rose 
6% to 4.37 million from 4.13 million in the prior year period. However, load factor for the month declined 3% points 
to 75% from last year's 78%.
British Airways plc (BAY.L, BAIRY.PK) said Wednesday that traffic for February increased 1.1% to 7.79 billion from 
7.71 billion, while passenger load factor was up 2.2 percentage points at 74.2%.
Air travel industry, the world over, has been hit hard by the global recession that reduced demand for the more 
lucrative business travel. However, of late, there are indications of recovery in most markets. While issuing the 
January 2010 demand statistics for international scheduled air traffic, Giovanni Bisignani, Director General and 
CEO of the International Air Transport Association, or IATA, said that demand is moving in the right direction and 
that ''we can start to see the future with some cautious optimism.''
It was reported on Wednesday that Andy Harrison, Chief Executive Officer of easyJet, is leaving to take up a similar 
role at hotel and restaurant group Whitbread Plc (WTB.L).

Budget airlines in Europe gained 13 million more passengers last year, with cheaper prices pulling in customers 
amid an overall drop in air travel.
The European Low Fares Airline Association, which includes Ryanair and easyJet, said an 8.7 percent increase in 
passenger numbers in 2009 allowed their industry expand and hire 3,000 more workers.
Airports say overall passenger numbers dropped 5 percent in Europe last year.
Major carriers were worst affected. The Association of European Airlines said members lost 20 million passengers 
last year down 5.8 percent to 325.9 million as a result of the economic downturn that has cut into business and 
vacation travel.
The low-fare airlines' group says its members carried 162.5 million passengers last year and their flights now 
account for over a third of scheduled services within Europe.
Irish-based Ryanair Holdings PLC is the biggest of these airlines, ferrying some 65.3 million people last year. 
EasyJet was second with 46.1 million passengers.

Ryanair today said it is celebrating another victory in its battle against online re-sellers of its flights 
(screenscrapers).
The Regional Court of Hamburg ruled that the screenscraping of Ryanair.com is unlawful and banned German 
website Cheaptickets from selling Ryanair's flights.
Today's ruling follows a similar decision of January last which ruled that screenscraping by German website Vtours 
to resell Ryanair's flights was unlawful.
The Irish airline said today's win is a landmark decision in Europe as the Court today recognised that Ryanair has 
legally protected rights and that Cheaptickets were violating Ryanair's rights by screenscraping Ryanair.com. 
Ryanair has taken several high profile cases against screenscrapers throughout Europe as part of its long running 
campaign to try to stop their anti-consumer practices. These online resellers access Ryanair's website in breach of 
its Terms of Use, take its flight information and sell Ryanair tickets, with high additional charges, which are not

Just before Christmas, Michael O'Leary was driving his jeep along the Portlaoise by-pass when he had a phone call 
from Donald Trump.
The US tycoon-turned-television star, known as 'the Don', was finalising audacious plans for a  1 billion golf resort in 
north Scotland, and O'Leary's company, Sol Golf Construction, was one of four shortlisted to build the actual 
course. O'Leary pulled his jeep onto the hard shoulder and began playing hardball.
Twenty minutes later, the Kerry farmer had sealed the deal. ''Obviously, it came down to money and price," O'Leary 
said. ''Trump was haggling, trying to get me to come down lower. He was negotiating all the way, it was a very 
educational call for me. He gave us the job there and then, over the phone."
O'Leary had been hunting for the deal ever since it emerged that Trump was planning to build the resort on the 
Aberdeenshire coastline.
O'Leary's company specialises in turning architects' blueprints into finished courses, and he went all out to land the 
Trump deal. He flew a number of Trump's lieutenants to Ireland, treating them to a whistlestop helicopter tour of 
some prestigious seaside courses his company had worked on, including Portmarnock, Baltray, Ballybunion and 
Royal Dublin.
Nick Faldo even put in a good word for O'Leary - Sol Golf has just finished building a Faldo-designed golf course on 
the banks of Lough Erne in Fermanagh, and the former world number one golfer was happy to act as a reference.
''His brief to me was simple - he wanted to build the best golf course in the world, and he wanted us to build it," said 
O'Leary.
Sol Golf began enabling work on the site in recent weeks, carrying out stabilising work on sand dunes. Full 
construction will begin in the summer, and O'Leary said the course would be complete by 2012.
Fairways, not airways
When that is completed, the company will start work on a second, adjoining course. O'Leary refused to divulge the 
value of the contract, but said it was the company's biggest project to date. He said that when full construction was 
under way , Sol Golf would double jobs to about 100.
''T his is one of the most prestigious contracts we have ever received," he said. ''It is certainly our largest project. 
With the economic pressures over here, it could not have come at a better time."
O'Leary might share a famous moniker - ''same name, different bank balance'' - but his company is definitely more 
low profile that Ryanair. Despite building a string of new courses in Ireland over the past decade and carrying out 
work on close to 100 others, he admits that most people outside the golf industry have never heard of Sol.
''It is a word-of-mouth business," he said. ''Anyone who should know about us knows exactly who we are. When 
you are working on championship golf courses, the main thing is to get the job done with the maximum of quality 
and minimum of fuss."
The lack of profile has not hampered Sol's growth. From a standing start in 1998, the company now employs 50 
people and generated revenues of  12 million last year.
Sol has also secured a blue chip portfolio of clients - the company has carried out renovation work on seven Irish 
Open golf venues, plus a number of Ryder Cup venues in Britain.
It has also been recruited by the game's governing body in Britain, the Royal & Ancient, to carry out work on a 
number of courses in preparation for the British Open tournament.
The company is currently working on Royal Lytham & St Anne's golf course ahead of the 2012 British Open, and 
has also landed contracts for work at Muirfield and Royal Liverpool, which will host the Open in 2013 and 2014 
respectively.
''This is a massive challenge. It is one thing to build new courses, but it is another thing to make a very, very good 
course even better," O'Leary said.
Sol Golf Construction began in auspicious circumstances. It was conceived following a chat between O'Leary, an 
organic farmer who owns a pub and restaurant in Ballydesmond on the CorkKerry border, and golf course builder 
Phil Standing. Shortly after, they set up in business together, establishing Sol. ''It kind of just happened, and we 
decided to try it. There was just the two of us in a van for the first job," he said.
O'Leary and his wife bought Standing's share in the business six years ago, although he still works for the business 
as a shaper. ''Phil sits in the bulldozer and he shells out the golf courses and shells the contours.
He is one of the best in the business," said O'Leary.
The company rode on the back of the Celtic tiger, building between two and four new golf courses each year for the 
past decade, and carrying out repair and reconstruction work on scores of other clubs throughout the country.
The recession hit hard, however, and last year, for the first time since it started, Sol did not start work on any new 
golf development. There was also a fall off in reconstruction work.
''The market is saturated in Ireland. There are too many golf courses. Lots of them are in difficulty," O'Leary said.
Fortunately, he had sensed the winds of change.
Three years ago, Sol ''got burned'' on a failed development in the midlands, and O'Leary reckoned it was time to 
start looking abroad for business.
This year, he said, most of the new work will be in Britain and the North. This week, he is due to begin work on a 
new practice area at the home of Irish golf star Rory McIlroy.
Fairways, not airways
Longer term, however, O'Leary is looking further afield. He said Sol was now tendering for work in the south of 
France, the north of Italy, Portugal and even Poland.
No deals have been concluded, but O'Leary said he expected one or two contracts to be agreed by the end of the 
year.
To help the expansion, Sol has set up a subsidiary, Sol Golf International, to handle the foreign work.
''The early response has certainly been promising," he said. ''The Trump project should open up a lot of doors. You 
are getting to the pinnacle of where you want to be. When we get overseas contracts, we will send out a 
management team, and then hire local labour.
''But we will never forget the home market. We will still have a dedicated team to service the Irish scene, " he said.
The company is also diversifying into other niche areas. It is now working on the new GAA centres of excellence in 
Portlaoise and Wicklow, and on a number of other pitch construction sites throughout the country.
Sol installed a large, artificial lake in the grounds of Martinstown House, the Limerick mansion owned by 
businessman JP McManus. However, the main focus of the company's work will remain golf related.
''We expected turnover to be down this year, but it will probably be up because of the new contracts. We are 
currently working on 11 courses on the island of Ireland, plus five in Britain. That is keeping us busy," he said.
Besides, O'Leary and Sol have a far tougher adversary than the economic downturn - the Irish weather. According 
to O'Leary, the last three years' weather had been ''shocking''.
''We lose a lot of days because of rain and frost. You burn all the grass if you drive on top of frost. It is a very 
complex and different business. It is not like building a house or a motorway," he said.
O'Leary cites the new Faldo course in Enniskillen to highlight his point. The site was effectively forest without any 
top soil, so Sol had to import 70,000 tonnes of sand to build the fairways and greens.
''We have had good sites, and then we have had dreadful sites," he said. ''We had one site where we nearly lost a 
machine one day - the machine just went down in the ground and we could only see the cab. We needed three 
machines to pull it out.
''There's a green there now.
There is a great satisfaction to that."

What are the main responsibilities of your job?
As technical director, I am involved in choosing the products and services we sell. On a daily basis, I am also 
involved in the design of our solutions, managing projects and delivering services.
What are your professional motivators?
To develop IT solutions for companies that enable them to work more effectively and flexibly. I want people to see 
IT as an enabler and not a necessary evil. I have always derived satisfaction from solving problems, which helps 
me in my current role.
How would you describe your work style?
As a manager, I am quite informal. However, my work style is direct and to the point.
What would you rate as the best decision you ever made in business?
Personally, I feel that knowing my own focus has served me very well in business. It is important to know your 
target market and then specialise in products and services that customers want and need. My decision to utilise my 
technical skills and work in this area has been the best decision I have made in business.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learnt?
To put yourself in the customer's shoes. It not only allows to you match your offering to their needs, but also I feel 
that customers appreciate it when they believe that you have their best interests in mind. I recommend solutions or 
infrastructure that meet the customers' needs. I would never propose a solution that I would not be happy to use or 
manage myself.
This comes from my own background as an IT administrator.
Working Week
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
I have always admired Ryanair's Michael O'Leary.
He has a great work ethic and makes a strong contribution to the Irish economy. He has created many Irish jobs 
directly and indirectly, and is a resident taxpayer. He is also not afraid to challenge the status quo.
What are your expectations for Irish businesses?
I think that we have started to come out of the economic downturn that dominated 2009.
In my experience, companies are willing to invest in quality IT solutions and services so, overall, 2010 will be a 
more positive year for business.
What is your ultimate professional goal?
This year marks my tenth year working with Brandon Consulting. I want to build on our past successes and ensure

BAA wins appeal over airports break-up
BAA wins appeal over airports break-up

BAA can keep Stansted, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, a tribunal ruled yesterday, as the UK's biggest airports 
operator scored a win in its fight against an antitrust watchdog order to break itself up.
The Competition Commission, which claims BAA's near-monopoly over Britain's biggest airports is harming 
passengers' interests, is to appeal against the judgment in a process that could take many months.
Ryanair, the biggest airline operating from Stansted, warned that the decision by the Competition Appeal Tribunal 
could end up deferring future sales of BAA airports "for a minimum of two years".
Any delay will give BAA, owner of Heathrow, Europe's busiest airport, valuable strategic breathing space even if it 
ends up being forced to sell the other airports.
The decision will add to questions about the commission's effectiveness after reversals in cases involving large 
companies, including Barclays and Tesco.
The commission ruled in March last year that BAA, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial infrastructure group, should sell 
Gatwick, Stansted and either Edinburgh or Glasgow airports to meet competition concerns.
BAA sold Gatwick for £1.5bn, which was less than it might have received if the sale had not taken place during the 
downturn.
It then won an initial appeal to the CAT in December after complaining the commission was guilty of "apparent bias" 
because Professor Peter Moizer, a member of the panel that ordered its break-up, was also an adviser to a pension 
fund linked to Manchester Airport Group, a potential buyer of its airports.
It had been hoped this would lead to an agreed settlement of the row.
However, the commission decided to appeal; the CAT today denied that appeal. The commission will now seek a 
ruling from the Court of Appeal.
BAA wins appeal over airports break-up
Ryanair, an ardent supporter of BAA's break-up, said it would have been more sensible to deal with BAA's claim by 
banning Manchester Airport Group from bidding for Stansted or either of the Scottish airports. The appeal tribunal 
decision "appears to be based on a legal technicality, or irrelevancy," said Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief 
executive.
The commission's original investigation into BAA took nearly two years and if its appeal against the tribunal now 
fails, it could take another two years for it to reinvestigate BAA.
The commission said the tribunal's latest judgment was "not a great surprise".
BAA reported on Monday it had suffered a £822m pre-tax loss last year, in part because of the forced sale of 
Gatwick.

Ryanair's chief executive has accused the government of incompetence in the "hangargate" row at Dublin Airport.
Speaking at a meeting last night of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Michael O'Leary claimed there 
had been no competition for the hangar, in which he says he wants to create 300 jobs.
He also said that the government had misrepresented the position relating to their ability to insist on a transfer of 
the property - Hangar 6 - to his airline.
He repeated that his company was willing to create 300 jobs in the hangar if it got access to it quickly. During the 
hearing, O'Leary was criticised by committee members for his refusal to accept alternatives to Hangar 6 that were 
being offered to him at the airport. The chief executive of Aer Lingus, which currently occupies the hangar, also 
spoke at the hearing, as did the head of the Dublin Airport Authority. Christoph Mueller described the ownership of 
the hangar as complicated, even bordering on the absurd, with the carrier effectively leasing the hangar from itself. 
As to why it was doing that, he replied: "I have asked myself the same question". DAA chief executive Declan 
Collier said a series of legal agreements dating back to the early 1990s gave Aer Lingus control over the hangar. 
Under these agreements, the DAA had leased the hangar to the Ulster Bank company First Active for a period to 
2017. First Active had sublet it to Shinagh, an Aer Lingus subsidiary, which subsequently sublet it on to a subsidiary 
of SR Technics, which then pulled out of Dublin last year. The DAA had bought SR Technic's interest in the hangar 
last year, but when the legal complexities at the building became clear, it decided that leasing the building back to 
Aer Lingus was the best course of action. Mr Mueller said his airline had not been leaving the hangar idle, and was 
using it to maintain up to six or seven aircraft a day. It also planned to move other parts of its business into offices 
at the hangar. He told the hearing categorically that Aer Lingus would not be leaving the facility. Earlier yesterday,

The ISEQ dipped again with the two main banks heading close to the psychologically important E1 a share mark on 
fears that they will end up in majority State ownership despite NAMA.
AIB stocks fell by 2c to E1.00 while Bank of Ireland dipped 5c to E1.06 amid investor uncertainty about how deep 
Government ownership will turn out to be when their developer loans are eventually transferred to NAMA and what 
their capital positions will be. Reports suggest that Bank of Ireland has launched a USD1bn two-year government 
guaranteed bond, priced at around 175bps above the relevant mid-swap. It is the bank's third issue under the new 
eligible liabilities guarantee. It issued a USD2.5bn five-year bond in January priced at 145bps over mid-swaps and a 
E3.5bn one-year bond in early February at a rate of 1.63pc. A report by ratings agency Fitch, however, says the 
expiry of Irish bank guarantees may negatively affect the ratings on some structured finance and covered bonds, 
but it expects the banks to take remedial action before the guarantee ends.
AIB will report 2009 results on March 2 and Goodbody are expecting a loss at the net income line of E2.3bn. the 
broker's expectation is for net interest income is E3.3bn (-14pc) and is forecasting margin contraction of 26bps to 
1.95pc. Non interest income should be boosted in the period by E623m of gains from a debt exchange earlier in the 
year. On a similar basis to how AIB will report (cost of guarantee within non-interest income), the broker is 
forecasting non-interest income of E1.5bn, though the associate stake in M and T will add a further E60m.
Elsewhere, Aer Lingus shares fell 3c to E0.56. Reports in today's press highlight the fact that Aer Lingus may have 
to consider making more than the 676 redundancies outlined in its cost cutting plan (possibly over 1,100), if the 
workforce rejects its restructuring plan in a ballot that is currently underway. Ballot results are expected at the 
beginning of March. Ryanair shares dropped 1c to E3.45. Chiquita reported a weak set of fourth quarter results 
(EPS of -60c compared to consensus of -27c). While its banana segment saw net sales increase by 15pc, this was 
driven by currency effects and on a like for like basis, profits in this division declined by 7.7pc. The company is

experiencing a decline in banana volumes in the UK and some European markets (France), with pricing failing to 
supplement earnings. Shares in fruit importer, Fyffes was up 1c at E0.47. CRH will issue full-year results on March 
2 which Davy expects will be broadly in line with its detailed trading update issued in early January. The broker is 
forecasting operating profit of just under E1bn, 46pc below the 2008 result. The Americas Products and Distribution 
divisions suffered the biggest fall, while Americas Materials profits are expected to decline by just 8pc - benefiting 
from stable infrastructure markets. It expects pre-tax profits of E754m, more than 50pc below the E1,628m reported 
in 2008. This includes circa E200m of restructuring charges associated with the cost restructuring plan implemented 
during 2009. This converts to earnings per share of 91.7c, 57pc below the 2008 result. CRH shares fell 10c to 
E17.36.

The ISEQ dipped again with the two main banks heading close to the psychologically important E1 a share mark on 
fears that they will end up in majority State ownership despite NAMA.
AIB stocks fell by 2c to E1.00 while Bank of Ireland dipped 5c to E1.06 amid investor uncertainty about how deep 
Government ownership will turn out to be when their developer loans are eventually transferred to NAMA and what 
their capital positions will be. Reports suggest that Bank of Ireland has launched a USD1bn two-year government 
guaranteed bond, priced at around 175bps above the relevant mid-swap. It is the bank's third issue under the new 
eligible liabilities guarantee. It issued a USD2.5bn five-year bond in January priced at 145bps over mid-swaps and a 
E3.5bn one-year bond in early February at a rate of 1.63pc. A report by ratings agency Fitch, however, says the 
expiry of Irish bank guarantees may negatively affect the ratings on some structured finance and covered bonds, 
but it expects the banks to take remedial action before the guarantee ends.
AIB will report 2009 results on March 2 and Goodbody are expecting a loss at the net income line of E2.3bn. the 
broker's expectation is for net interest income is E3.3bn (-14pc) and is forecasting margin contraction of 26bps to 
1.95pc. Non interest income should be boosted in the period by E623m of gains from a debt exchange earlier in the 
year. On a similar basis to how AIB will report (cost of guarantee within non-interest income), the broker is 
forecasting non-interest income of E1.5bn, though the associate stake in M and T will add a further E60m.
Elsewhere, Aer Lingus shares fell 3c to E0.56. Reports in today's press highlight the fact that Aer Lingus may have 
to consider making more than the 676 redundancies outlined in its cost cutting plan (possibly over 1,100), if the 
workforce rejects its restructuring plan in a ballot that is currently underway. Ballot results are expected at the 
beginning of March. Ryanair shares dropped 1c to E3.45. Chiquita reported a weak set of fourth quarter results 
(EPS of -60c compared to consensus of -27c). While its banana segment saw net sales increase by 15pc, this was

Aer Lingus is to move hundreds of staff into a new centralised operations centre in the hangar that has been at the 
centre of controversy at Dublin Airport in recent weeks.
It says it will have up to 400 people working at Hangar 6 by the middle of this year.
The hangar has been at the centre of a row over a claim by Ryanair that it will create 300 jobs there if Aer Lingus's 
lease on the facility is cancelled.
It claims that the flag carrier is only making minimal use of the hangar. Aer Lingus is currently doing some 
maintenance work there, but the structure also has enough modern office space for 400 or more staff. The airline 
now intends to put a new centralised operations centre in it, with operations control, flight operations and cabin 
operations, as well as maintenance and technical stores. A spokesman for the carrier says the staff concerned is 
currently spread over several buildings, and will now be centralised to create synergies. He added that some of the 
other accommodation currently being used by the airline at the airport is coming to the end of leases.

(ANSA) - FEBRUARY 23  - Airline Ryanair has announced  that it has ended its flights on Bari, Brussels (Charleroi),  
Barcelona (Reus), Bremen, Liverpool, Paris (Beauvais) and  Brescia. The airline specified that the decision was 
taken due  to a lack of support from the Alghero airport and Region  President Ugo Cappellacci for the development 
of new destinations, the  increase of passengers and local jobs.   ''Ryanair passengers who have already booked 
tickets for these flights'' the airline writes in a statement, ''have received or  will receive an e-mail as well as a full 
refund''.
Stephen McNamara of Ryanair commented: ''Unfortunately the  lack of support from the local administration and 
the airport  for a further development of the Ryanair base in Alghero has  caused the airline to cancel seven 
destinations from and to  Alghero. Ryanair will continue to grow and develop new routes,  where airport 
management and local administration make an effort to support new low-cost routes and continue to allow 
passengers  to fly during this period of crisis''.

Ryanair 's O'Leary has not met DAA head since 2007
Ryanair's O'Leary has not met DAA head since 2007

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has not had a one-to-one meeting with the head of the Dublin Airport 
Authority (DAA) for nearly two-and-a-half years.
O'Leary told The Sunday Business Post that, despite being the airport's biggest customer, he had not met DAA 
chief executive Declan Collier since September 2007, apart from a presentation he attended with three other airline 
chief executives in recent weeks.
O'Leary said neither of them had sought meetings with the other during the period, and neither had refused to 
attend. The DAA said there had been regular direct correspondence between the two since the last meeting, which 
continued. It added that Collier was always available to meet O'Leary and had never refused to meet him.
The relationship between the airline and the DAA hit another flashpoint last week as the row between Ryanair and 
the government continued over the airline's proposal last year to locate 500 aircraft maintenance jobs at Dublin 
Airport.
Letters exchanged between O'Leary and Tánaiste Mary Coughlan's office show that, as far back as February 2009, 
Ryanair wanted to locate 500 jobs at Hangar 6 if it could buy the lease on the hangar at the same price the DAA 
had paid for it.
The correspondence shows that, after referring O'Leary's proposal to IDA Ireland and subsequent deliberations, the 
Tánaiste said that it would not be possible for Ryanair to agree a commercial arrangement on the hangar without 
discussing it directly with the DAA.
O'Leary has said that he would have paid more than the DAA for the leases to the hangars - including Hangar 6 - 
vacated by SR Technics last year.
The DAA bought the leases back from SR Technics for a reported  20 million. However, O'Leary said last week that  
20 million for six hangars ''sounds very cheap''.
Ryanair 's O'Leary has not met DAA head since 2007
''You wouldn't build Hangar 6 for  20 million," he said.
''The DAA bought it back cheaply. I would have paid more."
Meanwhile, it emerged last week that the rent for Hangar 6 was  200,000 a year. In a letter to IDA Ireland last year, 
Ryanair said it had learned that the rent paid by SR Technics to the DAA was  200,000 a year, and the airline would 
be willing to pay this rent.
However, reports have suggested that Aer Lingus is paying  2.25 million a year for the rent of Hangar 6 - more than 
ten times the previous rent. The DAA declined to comment on any of the figures, citing commercial confidentiality.
O'Leary said that, by going public with the row over the jobs last weekend, he only intended to cause 
embarrassment to the government over its failure to do a deal last year.

The battle of Hangar 6

Body
Michael O'Leary's battle of Hangar 6 probably generated a lot more heat than light on the subject of what Ryanair 
was actually looking for from IDA Ireland, the government and the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA).
For O'Leary, the situation is quite clear. He wanted to base a 500-staff aircraft maintenance operation in Hangar 6 
at Dublin Airport when it became available last summer.
He wrote to the government and IDA Ireland, but was told the terminal was not available.
''We decided when we were told that last September, look, we're off," said the chief executive of Ryanair when 
asked why his company decided to locate the jobs abroad.
When he was told that Aer Lingus had an ''interest'' or certain ''rights'' regarding the hangar, he believed the DAA 
was deliberately trying to keep him out of it. The DAA later signed a 20-year lease with the airline for use of the 
hangar. Contrary to statements made in the Dáil last week, there was no bidding process for that agreement.
The DAA had moved extremely quickly to buy the leases on all six hangars from SR Technics when it decided to 
pull out of its Dublin operation a year ago.
On one level, it looks like the DAA outfoxed O'Leary by purchasing the hangars quickly and then signing a 20-year 
lease with Aer Lingus on the biggest facility.
However, O'Leary said that was not the case. He simply saw an opportunity to bring 500 jobs to Ireland, and the 
government/IDA/ DAA messed it up. Instead, according to O'Leary, the hangar went to Aer Lingus, which doesn't 
need it and isn't using it.
Central to the argument is whether Aer Lingus actually had rights or options regarding the use of the hangar, which 
meant any deal for use of that hangar had to be approved by the former state company.
The battle of Hangar 6
Sources at Dublin Airport said that this was clearly the case and that once Aer Lingus indicated it was interested in 
the hangar, the DAA was not free to override that with an open bidding process.
Conspiracy theories
Several questions hung in the air last week, and the absence of answers led to a few good conspiracy theories. The 
first question was: why does O'Leary want Hangar 6 and no other hangar? The first conspiracy theory suggested 
the Ryanair boss wanted to have the option to use it as an airport terminal at some point in the future.
But O'Leary says Hangar 6 is the only one in which he could place up to six aircraft side by side for maintenance, 
which would be the most efficient way to manage the operation. He said he never wanted it for a terminal, and 
would have agreed to that if he had got the hangar.
The second question is: why didn't O'Leary go public with his concerns about a possible sweetheart deal between 
the DAA and Aer Lingus last September?
O'Leary said that if he had gone public then, it would have been dismissed as Ryanair ''whingeing'' again. He said 
he went public last week after he announced a new 200-job maintenance deal at Prestwick in Scotland.
Incredibly, he said that all he wanted was to ''embarrass the government'' in relation to his offer of creating jobs and 
say: ''You lost 200 jobs."
According to O'Leary, the story gathered momentum and the political debate became one around whether the 
remaining 300 jobs could still be created at the airport. It may not have been O'Leary's original intention to engage 
in this process, but he decided to go for it, ''as a long shot''.
''The issue then became: could they [the jobs] be got back . . . do I think we'll get Hangar 6? No," he said.
O'Leary expects to announce details of several hundred more maintenance jobs by Ryanair at a continental 
European location in the coming weeks. This makes it sound like much of last week's brinkmanship was 
overcooked and, as O'Leary originally contended last Sunday, these jobs were already gone.
The main issue is whether, back in September, Aer Lingus really had pre-emption rights or a formal interest in 
ensuring that its maintenance is carried out at Hangar 6. If this is true, then Aer Lingus was within its rights to do the 
20-year lease deal with the DAA. O'Leary questions whether any such rights could formally exist. He said that Aer 
Lingus sold the hangar years ago, and it has changed hands twice since then.
Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, wrote last week that Hangar 6 was the only one capable of 
accommodating more than one of its large wide-body aircraft. According to O'Leary, Aer Lingus is not doing its 
heavy maintenance at Hangar 6, because it farmed that out to France on a ten-year deal. It is carrying out only line 
maintenance, which was previously done by Aer Lingus either outdoors or at one of the smaller hangars.
A second conspiracy theory suggested that O'Leary wanted Hangar 6 to service long-haul transatlantic aircraft in 
the future. O'Leary said this was nonsense. He said transatlantic would not be happening for Ryanair for at least 
another three to four years and, if it did happen, it wouldn't actually be a Ryanair venture.
He said that, even if such a venture were undertaken, he wouldn't ''locate heavy maintenance at Dublin Airport 
anyway'', and that the company would order and purchase new planes for the job.
''We would get Boeing, or whoever, to agree to do the maintenance for the first five years," he said.
O'Leary said last week that, if an Intel or a Dell came to the government looking to create 500 jobs, it would do 
everything it could to make it happen. He disagreed that his refusal to engage with the DAA on the issue should be 
an obstacle.
The battle of Hangar 6
''If a big multinational came to the government and said, 'We will create these jobs, but we don't want to deal with 
Shannon Development', for example, the government would say fine, deal directly with the department," he said. ''It 
wouldn't be a problem."
O'Leary still insists that a clause in the DAA/Aer Lingus contract should allow for the former state airline to be 
moved aside. He said Aer Lingus didn't need that hangar. Aer Lingus said it was vitally important.
O'Leary also believes the government could move Aer Lingus aside and into another hangar and, even if Aer 
Lingus sued for breach of contract, it could not win, because ''it could show no loss or damage''.
This presupposes that Aer Lingus could do in another hangar what it currently does in Hangar 6. Aer Lingus said 
this was not possible.
It looks like those maintenance jobs will not be coming to Dublin, and they have effectively been gone since last 
September. Meanwhile, O'Leary has laid down a marker with the government, IDA Ireland and the DAA. The next 
time he proposes bringing jobs to Ireland, he will get their full attention.

Ryanair has turned down the offer of a site at Shannon Airport for its project to create 300 aircraft maintenance 
jobs.
The offer was revealed yesterday by tanaiste Mary Coughlan, who said it Shannon Development had offered a site 
and new building for the project.
And, separately, government sources have said that Knock has also been put forward as a possible location.
But the low cost airline last night turned down both offers. It said its proposal for the creation of 300 engineering 
jobs "has just one condition - that Ryanair secures hangar 6 at Dublin airport". It added that hangar 6 fitted 
Ryanair's requirements, was not currently being used for the purpose for which it was built, and was near a pool of 
highly skilled aviation engineers who had formerly worked for SR Technics. "Ryanair will not be considering any 
other proposals," it said. The airline also insisted that it does not have a 'hidden agenda' to turn hangar 6 into a 
terminal building. It revealed correspondence from Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary to the IDA last July, 
offering guarantees not to use the hangar for any purpose other than aircraft maintenance and offices. Aer Lingus 
chairman Colm Barrington has, meanwhile, attacked Ryanair's conduct in the affair. In a letter to the Irish Times, he 
says: "Michael O'Leary's use of the lives and job prospects of 300 aircraft engineers at Dublin airport as pawns in 
another of his petulant and high-profile attacks on the Dublin Airport Authority and the Government is a gross insult 
to the people involved. "Further, his attempt to force the government to tortuously interfere with Aer Lingus's lease 
of hangar 6 is outrageous. "Hangar 6 is the only hangar at Dublin airport capable of accommodating more than one 
of the large wide-body Airbus A330 aircraft that Aer Lingus uses for its transatlantic services." In a letter to Mr 
O'Leary last night, the tanaiste said it was "absolutely clear" that neither the government nor the Dublin Airport 
Authority had any legal mechanism to secure the hangar 6 facility for Ryanair without the agreement of Aer Lingus. 
She said it was unfair to the many skilled workers who would be looking for jobs "to engage in continued debate

about Hangar 6, rather than focus constructively on the other possible options which include the use of available

Aer Lingus has told Fine Gael it can vacate Hangar 6, but no one has asked, the party's Dublin North TD Dr James

New facts in the case now pile on added pressure on the Tanaiste, Mary Coughlan, after she said that Aer Lingus

Fergus O'Dowd said it is now vital that Aer Lingus, Ryanair, Dublin Airport Authority and the IDA are invited to

enormous potential for negotiation over the hangar, and that there is a real hope we could secure 300 new jobs for 
north Dublin. This looks like probably the worst gaffe from one of the worst members of the Cabinet." "What is clear

Boeing head plots course to retake top spot from Airbus in four years

Highlight: Albaugh remarks reflect new group confidence
Body
Boeing should take back its crown as the world's biggest civil aircraft maker from Airbus, its European rival, within 
four years, according to the head of the US group's commercial aircraft business.
Boeing, maker of the 747 jumbo jet, the 777 twin-engined long-haul aircraft and the best-selling 737 short-haul jet, 
lost the top spot to Airbus for the first time in 2003.
Since then, Boeing has secured more orders than Airbus in some of the years as it started to market its new 787 
Dreamliner, but Airbus has had the upper hand on deliveries each year.
Last year, the European aircraft maker delivered 498 jets to Boeing's 481.
That may be about to change, according to Jim Albaugh, who took over as head of Boeing's commercial aircraft 
division last September.
"As we start delivering the 787 on top of the already pretty robust 737 and 777 lines . . . you're going to see the 
number of deliveries we have in 2013 and 2014 go up significantly from where they are today," he told the Financial 
Times.
"We might deliver a few more airplanes than them [Airbus] in that time frame," he said, referring to 2013-2014 and 
beyond.
Mr Albaugh's remarks reflect a new confidence at Boeing after getting its much-delayed 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 
freighter airborne in December and last week, respectively. Referring to the fierce rivalry between Airbus and 
Boeing, Mr Albaugh said people often urged him to take on the European company more aggressively.
"They say 'let's go capture market share' and I say, 'that's easy, just give airplanes away'. We're not going to do 
that. We walked away from some orders that we could have had in 2009 because we thought we could sell those 
airplanes for more when the cycle comes back in 2012 and 2013. You can't get so focused on a deal that you do a 
deal that doesn't make good economic sense for the company."
Boeing head plots course to retake top spot from Airbus in four years
Asked if he was referring to the failed talks with Ireland's no-frills group, Ryanair, which wanted to buy up to 200 
new 737 aircraft from Boeing last year, Mr Albaugh said he was "just talking about deals in general".
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, complained after talks broke down about dealing with " a bunch of 
numpties out in Seattle ".

EasyJet shareholders would surely empathise with Robert Evans, a slender traveller whose trip to St Petersburg 
was marred by his super-sized neighbour's spreading, uh, assets. "This," local reports quoted him saying , "isn't 
right."
Investors' concern is that EasyJet's fat cats are taking up an unduly large share of the discount airline's revenue: 
some 50m shares were voted against directors' remuneration at yesterday's annual meeting.
That was insufficient to block the awards but enough to give executives pause. So it should. EasyJet's board spent 
much of the past year squabbling over expansion plans before walking off in a huff. Andy Harrison, prevailed upon 
to remain a while longer in the pilot's seat, is set to pocket an additional £1.2m pay-off when he finally steps down 
this summer.
Paying up to keep people who are strategically at odds with each other is a bizarre way to run an airline, or anything 
else for that matter. Mr Harrison follows four other board members who had headed for the exit. News of his own 
departure came after a compromise on capacity growth: less than management wanted but higher than founder and 
non-executive director Stelios Haji-Ioannou was angling for. While Mr Harrison works out his notice Mr Haji-
Ioannou's attentions have switched, at least partially, to defending himself against the " inappropriate, inaccurate 
and personal attacks " by rival Ryanair. A new finance director joins in June and EasyJet claims progress finding a 
replacement for Mr Harrison.
To be fair, EasyJet's captains have succeeded in generating profits and returns in an ugly year; something not 
many airlines can trumpet. But they should listen to their not-so-silent minority: golden handcuffs to keep 
malcontents on board is about as welcome as being wedged into economy class beside the fattest man on the 
plane.

News In Brief
## EBS Building Society plans to borrow 1bn euro on the sale of a government-guaranteed five-year bond, making 
it the fourth institution to tap the bond market using the extended guarantee scheme. The building society plans to 
take advantage of the positive sentiment shown towards Irish debt following the raising of 1.5bn euro by the NTMA 
in a bond auction this week. EBS, which is in merger talks with Irish Nationwide Building Society, will open the book 
on the bond to investors today after testing market sentiment. - Irish Times
## Tanaiste Mary Coughlan asked Aer Lingus if it would move out of the hangar at the centre of the controversy 
over 300 jobs -- but it refused. Ms Coughlan personally rang Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller on 
Tuesday, ahead of her crunch meeting with Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary. But Mr Mueller refused to budge from 
the celebrated Hangar 6, so that the 300 aircraft maintenance posts promised by Ryanair for Dublin Airport could be 
secured by the Government. The latest twist in the jobs fiasco came as Ms Coughlan and Taoiseach Brian Cowen 
were accused of making excuses for failing to win the jobs. Mr Cowen insisted Aer Lingus had a binding contract on 
the hangar and there were alternatives available to Ryanair. - Irish Independent
## The biggest shareholder in the group that owns Cork homecare products business Punch Industries has sold its 
stake in a near 400m euro deal whose backers include Bank of Ireland. Axa Private Equity, part of French 
multinational Axa, has sold its 65.6 per cent stake in the Spotless group, which includes shoe polish and detergent 
manufacturer Punch and the Vim and Vigour cleaning products brands, to multinational rival BC Partners. Reports 
yesterday said the sale valued Spotless at 600m euro. Bank of Ireland was one of four banks which loaned BC 
Partners 300m euro of the finance, over 75pc of the price paid. - Irish Times ## There was a 12pc rise in the 
number of new job vacancies last month compared with January last year. Confidence in the jobs market is 
continuing to improve, according to research by Premier Group which found that although there are still some areas

that may not have quite reached the bottom of the cycle yet, most sectors are following a "slow but steady growth

The Taoiseach has insisted that the government cannot break the law in order to help win 300 maintenance jobs for 
Dublin Airport.
Mr Cowen told the Dail that it could not tear up a lease held by Aer Lingus on hangar 6 just because Ryanair 
wanted it.
The low cost airline is offering to create the jobs, but only if it can locate them in the hangar, which it claims Aer 
Lingus is barely using.
Mr Cowen told the house that the government was not indifferent about the jobs, but added that it could not break 
the law. He said Aer Lingus had said it needed the hangar, and he added that trying to tear up the lease would 
have "consequences". Fine Gael Leader Enda Kenny had claimed that the government was "just making excuses" 
while the 300 jobs were being lost. If the airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary was bluffing, the Taoiseach 
should call him in immediately and call his bluff, he said. Tourism minister Martin Cullen claimed there were enough 
facilities at Dublin Airport for what Ryanair wanted. Hangar 6 was "part and parcel" of Aer Lingus' plans at the 
airport going forward, he said. If other hangars were unsuitable, the Dublin Airport Authority and the IDA would 
create a purpose built facility for Ryanair. Following the Dail exchanges, the low cost airline insisted that there was 
no legal barrier to moving Aer Lingus out of the hangar. Ryanair claimed that the taoiseach's stance on the matter 
had consisted of "false claims" and "lies". It said that the tanaiste had told its chief executive Michael O'Leary at 
their meeting this week that Aer Lingus' 20 year lease had the same 12 month notice clause that all DAA leases 
have. The exercise of this clause by the DAA would not be a breach of the lease, and nor would it be breaking the 
law, it added.

Determined drive to get middle classes on the buses
Determined drive to get middle classes on the buses

Highlight: Interview
Brian Souter
Chief executive, Stagecoach
The campaign to broaden the appeal is paying off and other expansion plans are being investigated, writes Gill 
Plimmer
Body
The middle classes are on the buses and Brian Souter can barely contain his delight. The plain-talking Scotsman 
who heads the bus and rail company Stagecoach sees pound signs every time a time-pressed, white-collar worker 
takes a seat.
"We've destigmatised the buses and got the middle classes to use them - intelligently, along with their cars," he 
says.
The shift in patronage is good news for Mr Souter, the former bus conductor who went from owning a couple of 
second-hand buses in 1980 to a transport empire with a market value of £1.26bn this year.
Ever since he heard the adage that anyone over the age of 30 who used a bus could consider themselves a failure 
- often attributed to Margaret Thatcher - Mr Souter has set out to prove it wrong.
But while Mr Souter succeeded in building one of the world's largest public transport operators, carrying 2.5m 
passengers a day in the UK, US and Canada, the middle classes had remained stubbornly resistant to buses, 
traditionally viewed as the choice of the poor.
Mr Souter's success in broadening the customer base has been most extensive in the south of England. Passenger 
numbers on Stagecoach's British buses have risen by an average 3.4 per cent during the past five years, against 
an industry average of 0.4 per cent, excluding London.
But in Cambridge the number of passengers on its buses has doubled, and in Oxford buses now account for more 
than half of all journeys.
Determined drive to get middle classes on the buses
Some of Mr Souter's work is being done for him. Britain's roads are reaching gridlock, the rail infrastructure is 
creaking, pensioners have been granted free travel and the government is keen to burnish its green credentials by 
prising travellers out of their cars.
But Mr Souter has also pursued white-collar workers deliberately. First there was an advertising campaign with the 
slogan "you'd be surprised who you meet on the buses" by  East is East director Damien O'Donnell.
Then it launched the leather-seated Stagecoach Gold brand in Cheltenham, Farnborough and Aldershot - a 
concession to the more exacting tastes of its new clientele who, as Mr Souter says, "are more difficult customers 
than the socially marginalised".
More recently it has benefited from the "Aldi effect" when cash-strapped consumers shook off the stigma associated 
with bargain-basement deals.
Megabus, its no-frills bus service that prices tickets for as little as £1 a seat, has been such a success that Mr 
Souter is convinced the model - dubbed the Ryanair of the buses - should be followed everywhere.
"Everyone accepts yield management systems for airlines, but they need to accept it for buses and trains," he says.
This means that even as pre-tax profits have been hurt by the credit crunch - falling 28 per cent to £75.5m in the six 
months to October 2009 - bus passenger numbers continued to rise, up 3.6 per cent in 2008 and 3.2 per cent in 
2009.
Mr Souter has also tried to expand in other ways. Two successive attempts to acquire National Express operations 
failed last year. But Mr Souter says a deal - or at least a full-scale merger - is no longer on the cards.
"There wouldn't be the same value in it. It would be too expensive," he says. "They didn't have a management team 
at the time so it would have been easy. We feel the opportunity has passed."
But while rivals such as Arriva are looking to Europe to expand, Mr Souter is unlikely to follow suit, in spite of his 
experience running buses in Portugal and Sweden. "Some countries are too prescriptive," he says. "You can't bring 
your commercial expertise to a business if the rules are too tight."
As for the Competition Commission's inquiry into the bus industry, Mr Souter is characteristically scathing. "We just 
don't understand it. It's a completely open market. If one bus company doesn't turn up on time, another company 
can."
Such a reaction may be understandable from a company the Monopolies and Mergers Commission once described 
as "predatory, deplorable and against the public interest". But while Stagecoach was admonished in its early days, 
Mr Souter says he is "much better behaved now".
"If you're the first one over the trenches, you take all the trophies and the casualties," he says. "We set the ground 
rules in the 1980s and 1990s."
Mr Souter's pioneering spirit is not quenched yet. Recent tests of the first "amphibious" bus service on the Clyde 
ran into difficulties when its vehicle - which is part-bus, part-boat - was grounded after suspension airbags worked 
loose on its trial run. But he is convinced it will work in the long term.
Such innovation may be needed to compete with the industry's biggest rival - the car, favoured by the white-collar 
customers he is pursuing. "We are fighting to get market share from minicabs and cars. If we price too high, people 
will jump in a taxi."

Ryanair has warned that the chances of 300 new jobs at Dublin Airport are slipping away, following the failure of 
face-to-face talks with the government last night to make progress on accommodation for them.
The talks between the airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary and tanaiste Mary Coughlan ended without 
agreement.
Mr O'Leary described the 45 minute encounter as just "waffle about exploring other options".
He said he was now preparing to deliver the jobs to another airport elsewhere in Europe. "We have two other 
alternatives elsewhere," he said. "If the tanaiste doesn't want the jobs and the taoiseach doesn't want the jobs, then 
fine, they will just go somewhere else." Mr O'Leary said he now hoped to conclude an arrangement with another 
airport by Easter. He said he had done his best to offer the jobs to the government. "I came here this evening, the 
position has not changed, she is clearly trying to find some other escape," he said. "It is another example of Aer 
Lingus the Dublin Airport Authority, the Department of Transport and this Government trying to find ways of blocking 
Ryanair and if that means they lose 300 jobs I do not think frankly that they care." Mr O'Leary said the meeting with 
Ms Coughlan had centred on Hangar 6 at the airport being made available to Ryanair. The facility is currently 
leased to Aer Lingus for 20 years, but Mr O'Leary said they were making little use of it. He said she had told him 
that Aer Lingus had rejected a proposal to sub-lease the facility to Ryanair. The meeting had discussed the 
possibility of a new hangar for Ryanair, but Mr O'Leary said the only space for it was at the other side of the airport. 
"You would have to go to their other side of the runways and then you can't get the aircraft or the engineers across 
the runways which is the big problem at Dublin airport," he said. Mr O'Leary said he had ended the meeting when 
Ms Coughlan told him that she would not ask the Dublin Airport Authority to exercise a clause allowing them to 
terminate Aer Lingus's lease on the hangar. "I said 'Frankly the meeting's over'. We got up, shook hands and 
walked out," he said. Ms Coughlan said after the meeting that her door was still open to look at other ways to

secure the maintenance operation for Dublin. She said she believed that it was still achievable with common sense 
and goodwill.

Ryanair has warned that the chances of 300 new jobs at Dublin Airport are slipping away, following the failure of 
face-to-face talks with the government last night to make progress on accommodation for them.
The talks between the airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary and tanaiste Mary Coughlan ended without 
agreement.
Mr O'Leary described the 45 minute encounter as just "waffle about exploring other options".
He said he was now preparing to deliver the jobs to another airport elsewhere in Europe. "We have two other 
alternatives elsewhere," he said. "If the tanaiste doesn't want the jobs and the taoiseach doesn't want the jobs, then 
fine, they will just go somewhere else." Mr O'Leary said he now hoped to conclude an arrangement with another 
airport by Easter. He said he had done his best to offer the jobs to the government. "I came here this evening, the 
position has not changed, she is clearly trying to find some other escape," he said. "It is another example of Aer 
Lingus the Dublin Airport Authority, the Department of Transport and this Government trying to find ways of blocking 
Ryanair and if that means they lose 300 jobs I do not think frankly that they care." Mr O'Leary said the meeting with 
Ms Coughlan had centred on Hangar 6 at the airport being made available to Ryanair. The facility is currently 
leased to Aer Lingus for 20 years, but Mr O'Leary said they were making little use of it. He said she had told him 
that Aer Lingus had rejected a proposal to sub-lease the facility to Ryanair. The meeting had discussed the 
possibility of a new hangar for Ryanair, but Mr O'Leary said the only space for it was at the other side of the airport. 
"You would have to go to their other side of the runways and then you can't get the aircraft or the engineers across 
the runways which is the big problem at Dublin airport," he said. Mr O'Leary said he had ended the meeting when 
Ms Coughlan told him that she would not ask the Dublin Airport Authority to exercise a clause allowing them to 
terminate Aer Lingus's lease on the hangar. "I said 'Frankly the meeting's over'. We got up, shook hands and 
walked out," he said. Ms Coughlan said after the meeting that her door was still open to look at other ways to

Ryanair today rejected what it called "false claims" and "lies" by the Taoiseach in the Dail this morning over the 300 
jobs Ryanair says it can create in Hangar 6.
"In the Dail this morning, An Taoiseach made four false claims about Ryanair's offer to create up to 300 jobs, if the 
airline was sold or leased the Hangar 6 heavy maintenance facility," Ryanair said.
It says that the Taoiseach "claimed that Aer Lingus has a 20 year lease over the Hangar 6 facility and that this 
lease cannot be broken. This is untrue, since the Tanaiste at last night's meeting with Ryanair confirmed that Aer 
Lingus' 20 year lease has the same 12 month's notice clause in it (as all DAA leases do), allowing the DAA to 
request Aer Lingus to vacate Hangar 6. The exercise of this Clause by the Govt owned DAA would not be a breach 
of the lease, and nor would it be breaking the law, as the Taoiseach wrongly claimed".
Also that "the Taoiseach claimed that there was a 24 months notice period in the Aer Lingus Hangar 6 lease. This is 
also untrue, since the Tanaiste at least evening's meeting with Ryanair confirmed that the notice clause in the Aer 
Lingus Hangar 6 lease was 12 months. The fact that Aer Lingus have put very little into Hangar 6 (other than 95 line 
engineers) means that this facility could be vacated by Aer Lingus within 12 weeks which would allow Ryanair to 
start recruiting some former SRT engineers for heavy maintenance on Ryanair's fleet from September 2010 
onwards." And that "The Taoiseach claimed that there was "a competition" for the Hangar 6 facility. This is untrue. 
There was no such competition. Ryanair calls on the Taoiseach to publish the terms of this competition (since they 
don't exist) and he should also confirm how Aer Lingus won this competition in November, when they created not 
one new job in the Hangar 6 facility, over Ryanair, which offered (last September) to create up to 500 jobs in the 
facility. How could an airline creating no jobs, win this alleged competition over an airline offering to create 500 jobs. 
The Taoiseach should explain this false claim." And that "The Taoiseach claimed Ryanair "did not make an offer" 
for Hangar 6. This is also untrue. Ryanair have published the written offers it made directly to An Tanaiste in August 
Ryanair accuses Taoiseach of "lies" Ryanair row
and September last year, offering to create up to 500 maintenance jobs in Hangar 6 on the basis that Ryanair would 
be sold or leased the Hangar 6 facility. The Taoiseach's claim that Ryanair did not make an offer for the facility is 
false". Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "It is extraordinary that the Taoiseach has now allowed himself to be tied up 
in the same lies which have been put about by the DAA for a number of days now. The Tanaiste last night 
confirmed (1) that the DAA can require Aer Lingus to vacate Hangar 6, (2) this can be done within 12 months 
(although Ryanair believes it could be done within 12 weeks given that Hangar 6 is empty) (3) that Ryanair did 
make an offer for the Hangar 6 facility last September and (4) the claim that Aer Lingus "won" a competition in 
November last despite creating no new jobs whatsoever are all false claims." "Ryanair calls on the Taoiseach to 
correct these false claims, or alternatively publish the terms of the competition he claims Aer Lingus won last year, 
and explain to the 800 unemployed SRT engineers on what basis Aer Lingus won this competition (when they have 
created no jobs and have no heavy maintenance hangar) over Ryanair who offered 500 jobs and can start putting 
heavy maintenance work into Hangar 6 from September of this year. The Govt have yet to explain (as the Tanaiste 
refused to at last night's meeting) why they are allowing Aer Lingus and the DAA to block Hangar 6 which is 
currently empty, from an airline which is offering to create 300 jobs and allocate a large volume of heavy 
maintenance work to this facility. Why does the Taoiseach, the Tanaiste and this Govt willingly allow 300 aircraft 
engineers to draw the dole, while they preside over and defend Aer Lingus blocking the large heavy maintenance 
Hangar 6 facility, when all of Aer Lingus' heavy maintenance has been contracted overseas for the next 8 years?"

A face-to-face meeting is to take place today between Tanaiste Mary Coughlan and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary over 
the airline's plan for 300 jobs at Dublin Airport.
Megaphone diplomacy between the two sides finally ended last night when Coughlan's office made contact with the 
airline.
A time for the meeting is to be fixed this morning.
A spokesman for the Tanaiste said the meeting would try to resolve any issues standing in the way of creating the 
jobs. "If he is serious we will be doing everything in our power to facilitate them," the spokesman said. He said that 
if this meant building a hangar or finding an existing hangar, this would be done. At the weekend, Ryanair claimed 
that it had offered to create 500 jobs at the airport in hangars formerly used by the SR Technics company at the 
airport. However, 200 of the proposed jobs have now been earmarked for Prestwick in Scotland. Ryanair says it still 
wants to locate the remaining 300 in Dublin, but it refuses to deal directly on the matter with the Dublin Airport 
Authority. Letters released by the airline at the weekend showed that Ms Coughlan had insisted that contact with 
the DAA was needed to progress the plans. Ms Coughlan yesterday defended her role in the affair, saying that 
everything possible had been done to help Ryanair.

The main Dublin shares index swung negative after a strong start after German economic confidence, while better 
than expected, still indicated weakness in the recovery of the eurozone's biggest economy.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 3.66 points to 2,859.05.
The euro recovered some of its recent losses against the dollar, helped by an above-forecast German survey and 
as investors concluded much of the bad news on Greece's public finances was priced in for now. German analyst 
and investor sentiment measured by the ZEW index fell for the fifth month running in February, coming in at 45.1, 
down from 47.2 in January but much better than expectations for a bigger fall to 42.0. Uncertainty that Greece's 
debt problems will be resolved quickly kept sentiment towards the single currency broadly negative, however, and 
traders said it remained vulnerable to further falls. "The (ZEW) outturn was not as bad as expected, the index 
remains above its long-run average and the fact that it is still in positive territory means that investors see conditions 
improving," said Jennifer McKeown, senior economist at Capital Economics. Euro zone states urged Greece on 
Monday to take further steps to control its budget deficit by mid-March if needed, but did not elaborate on last 
week's European Union pledge to support the country.
Kerry will release its full-year results on February 23rd. Davy expect an adjusted earnings per shaere outcome of 
164.1c (+6.6pc year-on-year) - in line with the company's guidance for the "upper end" of the 160-165c range. As 
highlighted at the November 19th interim management statement, Kerry continues to make strides in building a 
higher margin operating platform while growing volumes on a continuing basis. Shares in the food group fell 2c to 
E21.53. Shares in CRH were up 6c to E16.56. Polish cement sales fell by 58pc in January, according to the latest 
data from the Polish Cement Association. This follows a period of very harsh weather since mid-December when 
most construction activity appears to have come to a halt. Smurfit Kappa Group has announced plans to increase 
the price of its unbleached kraftliner by E60/tonne from April 1st. This is the latest in a series of price increases

announced by the company and its peers across the range of containerboard products - both recycled and kraft. 
Shares in the Irish group edged up 2c to E6.25. Ryanair was a big faller with shares down 4c to E3.33 as the row 
with the Government and the DAA over Hangar 6 continued. Tanaiste Mary Coughlan is reportedly due to meet 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary this evening to discuss the possible creation of 300 jobs at Dublin airport. 
After a day of crossed messages yesterday, Ms Coughlan and Mr O'Leary last night expressed their willingness to

The main Dublin shares index swung negative after a strong start after German economic confidence, while better 
than expected, still indicated weakness in the recovery of the eurozone's biggest economy.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 3.66 points to 2,859.05.
The euro recovered some of its recent losses against the dollar, helped by an above-forecast German survey and 
as investors concluded much of the bad news on Greece's public finances was priced in for now. German analyst 
and investor sentiment measured by the ZEW index fell for the fifth month running in February, coming in at 45.1, 
down from 47.2 in January but much better than expectations for a bigger fall to 42.0. Uncertainty that Greece's 
debt problems will be resolved quickly kept sentiment towards the single currency broadly negative, however, and 
traders said it remained vulnerable to further falls. "The (ZEW) outturn was not as bad as expected, the index 
remains above its long-run average and the fact that it is still in positive territory means that investors see conditions 
improving," said Jennifer McKeown, senior economist at Capital Economics. Euro zone states urged Greece on 
Monday to take further steps to control its budget deficit by mid-March if needed, but did not elaborate on last 
week's European Union pledge to support the country.
Kerry will release its full-year results on February 23rd. Davy expect an adjusted earnings per shaere outcome of 
164.1c (+6.6pc year-on-year) - in line with the company's guidance for the "upper end" of the 160-165c range. As 
highlighted at the November 19th interim management statement, Kerry continues to make strides in building a 
higher margin operating platform while growing volumes on a continuing basis. Shares in the food group fell 2c to 
E21.53. Shares in CRH were up 6c to E16.56. Polish cement sales fell by 58pc in January, according to the latest 
data from the Polish Cement Association. This follows a period of very harsh weather since mid-December when 
most construction activity appears to have come to a halt. Smurfit Kappa Group has announced plans to increase 
the price of its unbleached kraftliner by E60/tonne from April 1st. This is the latest in a series of price increases

announced by the company and its peers across the range of containerboard products - both recycled and kraft. 
Shares in the Irish group edged up 2c to E6.25. Ryanair was a big faller with shares down 4c to E3.33 as the row 
with the Government and the DAA over Hangar 6 continued. Tanaiste Mary Coughlan is reportedly due to meet 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary this evening to discuss the possible creation of 300 jobs at Dublin airport. 
After a day of crossed messages yesterday, Ms Coughlan and Mr O'Leary last night expressed their willingness to 
meet. Banks failed to rally after taking a battering over the past few sessions with AIB gaining just 3c to E1.09, Bank 
of Ireland up 2c to E1.23 and Irish Life and Permanent rose 2c to E2.65. The fourth quarter IBF/PwC mortgage 
market profile reveals that the number of mortgages issued in 2009 dropped by 58.5pc year-on-year (yoy) to 
45,818. The buy-to-let (BTL) and remortgage segments recorded the greatest falls, down 77pc and 73pc 
respectively yoy. Loans to first-time buyers (FTBs) showed the smallest decline, down 36pc, while the mover and 
top-up segments fell by 54pc and 58pc respectively.

The Tanaiste Mary Coughlan has rejected claims by Ryanair that it failed to act to bring up to 500 aircraft 
maintenance jobs to Dublin Airport.
Ryanair claimed over the weekend that it had offered to create 500 jobs on the SR Technics site after it closed last 
year with the loss of 1,000 jobs.
She said that decisions as to the location of any investment by Ryanair is in the final analysis a matter for the 
Company.
"Over a protracted period last year every effort was made by me in consultation with IDA Ireland, to advance the 
outline proposal for securing the Ryanair investment for Dublin Airport, including direct engagement by IDA Ireland, 
at my request," the Tanaiste said. Despite the best efforts of IDA, as acknowledged by Mr. O' Leary of Ryanair, it 
was not possible to overcome obstacles in relation to access to specific hangar space at the airport." 
Correspondence released by the airline after they made the initial offer to the Tanaiste shows that Mary Coughlan 
replied that direct discussion with the airline and the DAA was needed to progress the plans. In response, six 
months later Ryanair announced that 200 of the jobs were to go to Glasgow. The airline has criticised Ms Coughlan 
and said the Tanaiste 'fobbed them off'. But the Minister said every effort was made by her and IDA Ireland to 
secure the Ryanair investment and urged the airline to continue their dialogue with her.

The tanaiste has defended herself against an accusation of failing to secure 500 new Ryanair jobs for Dublin 
Airport.
The budget airline accused Ms Coughlan and transport minister Noel Dempsey of missing out on its offer of 500 
new engineering and maintenance posts there.
Instead, it said, 200 of the jobs had now gone to Prestwick Airport in Scotland.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary had asked the government to act as intermediary between it and the 
Dublin Airport Authority because his airline did not want to deal with the airport authority itself. Ms Coughlan said 
that, despite every effort, it had not been possible to secure the hangar space in Dublin. "Despite the best efforts of 
IDA, as acknowledged by Mr O'Leary of Ryanair," she said yesterday, "it was not possible to overcome obstacles in 
relation to access to specific hangar space at the airport." O'Leary had wanted to buy or lease the hangar at the 
same price the authority had bought it from the SR Technics company, which had previously occupied it. SR 
Technics closed last April at Dublin Airport with the loss of 1,100 jobs in aircraft maintenance. Mr O'Leary had said 
neither the tanaiste nor the transport minister had been willing to stand up to the DAA monopoly, even when this 
resulted in the loss of 500 well paid engineering jobs. "Ryanair expects to announce a second maintenance facility 
at another EU airport later this year, which will account for the remainder of these jobs," he said. In a statement last 
night, the Dublin Airport Authority said it would have been happy to engage in discussions with any company with 
plans to create jobs at Dublin Airport. "The DAA would have talked to Ryanair about its plans," it said. "But at no 
stage did Ryanair approach the DAA in relation to having meaningful commercial negotiations with regard to this 
matter."

Technics closed last April at Dublin Airport with the loss of 1,100 jobs in aircraft maintenance. Mr O'Leary had said 
neither the tanaiste nor the transport minister had been willing to stand up to the DAA monopoly, even when this 
resulted in the loss of 500 well paid engineering jobs. "Ryanair expects to announce a second maintenance facility 
at another EU airport later this year, which will account for the remainder of these jobs," he said. In a statement last 
night, the Dublin Airport Authority said it would have been happy to engage in discussions with any company with 
plans to create jobs at Dublin Airport. "The DAA would have talked to Ryanair about its plans," it said. "But at no 
stage did Ryanair approach the DAA in relation to having meaningful commercial negotiations with regard to this 
matter."

The tanaiste has defended herself against an accusation of failing to secure 500 new Ryanair jobs for Dublin 
Airport.
The budget airline accused Ms Coughlan and transport minister Noel Dempsey of missing out on its offer of 500 
new engineering and maintenance posts there.
Instead, it said, 200 of the jobs had now gone to Prestwick Airport in Scotland.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary had asked the government to act as intermediary between it and the 
Dublin Airport Authority because his airline did not want to deal with the airport authority itself. Ms Coughlan said 
that, despite every effort, it had not been possible to secure the hangar space in Dublin. "Despite the best efforts of 
IDA, as acknowledged by Mr O'Leary of Ryanair," she said yesterday, "it was not possible to overcome obstacles in 
relation to access to specific hangar space at the airport." O'Leary had wanted to buy or lease the hangar at the 
same price the authority had bought it from the SR Technics company, which had previously occupied it. SR 
Technics closed last April at Dublin Airport with the loss of 1,100 jobs in aircraft maintenance. Mr O'Leary had said

O'Leary downplays Christmas disruption

Ryanair has played down the effect on its revenues of disruption caused by severe snowstorms over the Christmas 
period. Chief executive Michael O'Leary told analysts that the airline managed to operate approximately 80 per cent 
of its scheduled flights over the period, and that the hit to revenues would be ''nothing of the order'' of the  16 million 
hit recently reported by no-frills rival Easyjet.
''I doubt if it's even a million or two," said O'Leary.
The airline said its operations from London airports benefited from its greater use of Stansted airport, where 
disruption was less severe than at Gatwick, which accounts for a smaller proportion of its London traffic. O'Leary 
accused other airlines of not doing enough to operate flights as scheduled despite the disruption caused by the 
poor weather, saying that some ''threw in the towel''. He described the financial impact of the disruptions as ''small'' 
and ''immaterial''.
He added that some airlines were ''maybe just threatening about their cost problems and looking for excuses'' in 
relation to the disruption. ''We don't do that," he said.
The poor weather caused widespread disruption at a number of Irish airports, but had a particular impact on airlines 
serving the south-east of England, with all airports in London suffering long delays and cancellations.

chief Stelios around Trafalgar Square.
Body
In the latest twist in a row between Ryanair and Britain's EasyJet over Ryanair ads calling EasyJet a "high fares" 
airline, Michael O'Leary has offered to settle the matter with a running race between him and EasyJet chief Stelios 
around Trafalgar Square in London.
The row has blown up over the last week with easyJet and Stelios' lawyers (Herbert Smith and Rachel Atkins) 
threatening Ryanair with legal action over Ryanair's recent adverts.
Michael O'Leary has promised to stop calling easyJet a "high fares" airline or an "always late" airline in its ads if 
Stelios wins the race, but if Stelios loses, then easyJet will admit that it is just another high fares airline (by 
comparison with Ryanair).
Laying down this challenge today, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said: "I am currently in rigorous training and believe 
that my daily regime of 40 cigarettes, 24 beers and extended sessions on the couch watching TV, leaves me in 
perfect shape to beat Stelios in a 21st Century version of the "Chariots of Fire" race around Trafalgar Square." "We 
believe this race will be a much better use of Stelios' time rather than paying expensive lawyers to issue vacuous 
threats, when both Stelios and easyJet know they can't compete with Ryanair's prices and they can't match our 
punctuality either. If Stelios is too "tired" to run, then I will offer him the alternative of a wheelbarrow race around 
Trafalgar Square, with the winner taking all. Win or lose, at least Stelios and easyJet will save a fortune on 
expensive lawyers fees. No expensive lawyers can alter the facts, compared to Ryanair, easyJet is a high fares 
airline, and an always late airline." "See you in Trafalgar Square Stelios!"

Irish no-frills airline, Ryanair, today announced that it will build a second maintenance hangar at Glasgow Prestwick 
Airport in a £8m investment.
It said it will create 200 new engineering jobs, increasing the total jobs sustained by Ryanair in Ayrshire to over 
2,400.
The facility, which is due to open in October 2010, was announced in Prestwick by Scotland's First Minister, Alex 
Salmond and Ryanair's Michael O'Leary.
The Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise and Prestwick Airport secured this 6,000 sq/m hangar investment 
despite intense competition from five other Ryanair bases throughout Europe. They were also instrumental in 
securing Ryanair's existing 4,000 sq/m hangar which opened in 2004. "By securing this new investment the Scottish 
Government has helped to create over 400 engineering and support jobs between the two hangars, which will 
maintain a large portion of Ryanair's 210 aircraft fleet. Ryanair's 29 routes from its Prestwick base deliver 2m 
passengers p.a. which sustain 2,000 local jobs, including those of over 300 Ryanair cabin crew and pilots," Ryanair 
said. Ryanair also announced three new routes from Edinburgh to Faro, Marrakesh and Paris from May 2010 as 
well as increased frequencies on 16 other routes from Edinburgh and Glasgow Prestwick this summer. In total 
Ryanair expects to carry over 4m passengers to/from Scotland over the next 12 months, making Ryanair Scotland's 
favourite airline.

Ryanair held fourth position in the visibility stakes in the third quarter of 2009 but by the last three months of the

Dateline: VILNIUS Lithuania
Body
Budget airline Ryanair will establish a major hub in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas, its first in Central and Eastern 
Europe, the company's chief executive announced Tuesday.
Ryanair will $140 million into the project, CEO Michael O'Leary told reporters in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, adding 
that Ryanair would introduce 18 new routes from Kaunas and employ 150 pilots and flight attendants to serve them.
Ryanair has been searching for a hub in Eastern Europe for several years, and O'Leary said the discount carrier 
chose Lithuania because of its attractive business climate, good infrastructure and rapidly growing passenger 
numbers.
Kaunas authorities slashed airport taxes last year after Lithuania's main carrier, flyLAL, was forced into bankruptcy, 
depriving the country of its own airline.
Ryanair will allocate two new Boeing 737-800 aircraft to the Kaunas hub, O'Leary said. He said he expected 
passenger numbers at the Kaunas airport to more than double this year to 1 million. The hub is also expected to 
create 1,000 jobs.
Kaunas, an hour's drive from Vilnius, is Lithuania's No. 2 city but has one of the highest rates of joblessness in the 
Baltic state of 3.4 million people.
O'Leary said Ryanair was considering opening other hubs in Eastern Europe.

O'Leary off the mark
Michael O'Leary's letter (Farce at Dublin Airport, 31/1/10) contained a number of spurious claims and inaccuracies. 
The cost of the Terminal Two project at Dublin Airport is  609million, not  1.2 billion.
That  609million covers the cost of the new terminal building ( 395 million),the new Pier E boarding gate facility, 
additional aircraft parking stands, a new energy centre and a major upgrade of the airport's campus road network.
O'Leary claimed that Ryanair's decision to reduce capacity had nothing to do with demand, but was purely related 
to costs. Any notion of ''weak demand'' was ''DAA spin'', he added.
However, less than 24 hours after the letter appeared in your newspaper, Ryanair's deputy chief executive, Michael 
Cawley, confirmed that demand was weak, not just in Ireland, but also in Britain, which is one of the most popular 
destinations for air travel from Ireland.
''We're seeing demand return, not quite to pre-2009 levels yet, in places like Germany, Scandinavia, Italy, France 
and Spain, they're moving back up," Cawley told the Financial Times. ''In Britain, particularly in provincial Britain, 
and Ireland, there's no sign of that yet."
If, as Ryanair claims, charges at Dublin Airport are one of the key reasons for reducing capacity, why did the 
company expand its services to summer sun destinations from Dublin on the same day that it announced its 
proposed capacity reductions?
Passengers pay the same charge at Dublin Airport whether they are flying to Malaga or to Manchester.
It is also worth noting that the passenger charge at Dublin Airport is the same whether it is the height of summer or 
a wet Wednesday in January.
Letters to the editor
In relation to costs, Dublin Airport's charges remain hugely competitive compared with its peer group. Dublin's 
proposed passenger charge for 2010,as suggested by the independent aviation regulator, is 25 per cent lower than 
the average  12.50 passenger charge levied in 2008 by comparable European airports such as Stansted, Gatwick, 
Brussels, Copenhagen, Lisbon, Zurich, Vienna, Munich and Oslo.
Paul O'Kane Public affairs director, Dublin Airport Authority
Interest rates need to rise
Your common-sense comment on the need for the banks to raise interest rates (31/1/10) was in marked contrast to 
the populist shrieking of Messrs Kenny and Gilmore in the Dáil.
By all means, hammer the banks for their reckless and irresponsible behaviour, but they still need to raise rates - 
regardless of what the ECB does. The fact that this necessary move will generate lots of media hysterics is no 
excuse for politicians to jump on the lynch mob bandwagon. Leadership, in deed!
Brian Tormey Edenmore, Dublin 5
We have lost our way
How can bankers and developers be allowed to walk the streets with impunity, while social welfare recipients face 
financial cuts and hardship?
How can a society deem it necessary for wage cuts in the private and public sectors, while semi-state workers at 
ESB and Bord Gáis - with average earnings over three times the industrial average - get pay increases, while 
consumers are charged among the highest energy prices in the EU?
We now live in a country that has lost its way. Only occasionally a light flickers, such as in the generosity shown by 
the Irish people in its donations to the people of Haiti.
Ciarán T Bailey Dundrum, Dublin
Haiti aid is ineffective
The killing machine can be put in motion at the press of a button, but not so when it comes to humanitarian aid for 
unfortunates. Tonnes of aid is lined up on pallets in Haiti with no one in charge, while - yards away, at a wire fence - 
hundreds look for help.
The UN and Brussels are seemingly useless. Why don't we hand over the whole shebang to the likes of Goal's 
John O'Shea?
Noel McAuley Beresford Street, Dublin 7
FF does not deserve votes
How can any sane or rational person even begin to justify voting for a Fianna Fáil candidate in light of the party's 
record of corruption, cronyism and mismanagement over at least the last 40 years?
It simply is not possible that so many people genuinely do not understand the link between the political corruption of 
Fianna Fáil and the failure of every pillar of Irish civil society to do what it was meant to do honestly, transparently 
and with the public interest to the fore.
Anyone who expresses an intention to vote for Fianna Fáil does so in the full knowledge that such a vote will lead to 
more corruption, more financial mismanagement, more child and care home abuses, more people marginalised or 
denied public services and even greater inequality.

Even the dumbest victims of domestic abuse finally get the message that, until they end the relationship, the abuse

Mind-altering shops
When I first heard all the fuss about head shops opening up throughout the country, I thought: aren't they brave to 
do that in these recessionary times?
I assumed they must be benefiting from start-up enterprise grants from the government to get the ball rolling - until I 
got wind of what they had on their shelves.
Young people seemed to be the main customers and should have more sense, but a lot of people seem to go 
through some sort of mid-life crisis when the big 4-0 looms on the horizon. They try and relive their youth using the 
mind-enhancing bath salts stocked in these head shops for  30 or  40 a pop.

Identity in crisis?
Given such an adverse migration pattern - escalating emigration, together with ongoing immigration - are we in 
danger of losing what Wolfe Tone called ''the thing called a country''?

Disasters taking their toll
As the world's population has trebled since the 1950s,i t appears that wars, famines or plagues are reducing our 
numbers. I hate to come across as a doomsday seer, but I fear that earthquakes and the ensuing diseases are on 
that mission.

Ryanair's routes to and from Ireland are the least profitable parts of its entire network, according to Michael 
O'Leary, its chief executive.
Speaking after the airline reported third quarter pre-tax losses of  12.5 million last week, O'Leary told analysts that 
high costs, including charges at Dublin Airport, and the government's controversial  10 departure tax were to blame. 
''The Irish routes are the least profitable routes we have because they are the highest cost ones," O'Leary said.
''We keep listening to this nonsense that . . . the golden goose is the Irish airports, and we make so much money in 
them. It's usually the opposite is the case."
O'Leary said that Ryanair would seek to grow its business in Spain and Portugal instead of Ireland, despite 
announcing last week that Ryanair would go head-to-head with Aer Lingus over the summer months with new 
holiday routes to selected destinations.
''Our choice and selection of base is not because we think we can get high yields in those bases," he said. ''The 
choice and the selection [are] based on where we have low airport costs [and] efficient operating facilities."
O'Leary also said that Aer Lingus's new hybrid strategy, which was announced last month by its new chief 
executive, Christoph Mueller, was ''doomed to failure''
''It's not a low-fare airline, and it's not a high-service airline, it's somewhere in-between," O'Leary said. ''It's an 
airline, but not as we know it."

Companies to be taxed on share buybacks
Companies to be taxed on share buybacks

Length: 392 words

Quoted companies such as Ryanair and Grafton face the prospect of massive tax bills on future distributions of 
cash to shareholders following radical changes to the tax treatment of share buybacks.
The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are seeking to close off an arrangement that allows 
quoted companies to distribute profits to shareholders by way of share buybacks instead of paying conventional 
dividends.
A number of quoted companies, such as Grafton, the building materials group, have a policy of implementing a 
share buyback instead of paying an annual or half-yearly dividend to shareholders.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary recently signalled that the airline was considering a major cash distribution 
of up to  1 billion by way of share buyback from 2013.
Share buybacks currently offer a tax advantage to shareholders.
They allow a company to use its profits to reduce the number of shares in circulation, engineering a higher share 
price, as each share represents a marginally bigger stake in the company in question.
Shareholders who benefit from this higher share price and cash in their gains currently only have to pay tax at the 
Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rate of 20 per cent. By contrast, however, shareholders who receive dividends from 
quoted companies incur an income tax liability of up to 41 per cent, depending on their individual circumstances, as 
well as additional government levies.
Companies paying a dividend must, at present, deduct dividend withholding tax (DWT) at a rate of 20 per cent on 
payments to shareholders, while individuals who are taxable at a higher rate must account for their liability in their 
annual tax return.
Companies to be taxed on share buybacks
Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan plans to introduce a change to the tax code, with the enactment of the Finance 
Bill in April, which will impose severe restrictions on share buybacks. The new rules will force quoted companies 
which engage in a share buyback to notify the Revenue Commissioners.
Companies are not taxed on buybacks under current rules, because buybacks are not treated as taxable 
distributions of profits to shareholders. They will, in future, be deemed to be taxable, however, if ''the main purpose 
or one of the main purposes'' of the buyback is to enable shareholders ''to participate in the profits of the company'' 
or those of a majority owned subsidiary.

O'Leary pours scorn on Aer Lingus 'flip-flop'
O'Leary pours scorn on Aer Lingus 'flip-flop'

Less than a week after new Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller abandoned the pure low-fare strategy of 
his predecessors, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary used the announcement of better than-expected third quarter 
numbers to heap scorn on his new rival.
''We are noticing a continuing trend of other competitors cutting capacity at airports where we operate," said 
O'Leary, who opted to describe Aer Lingus's proposed new strategy as ''the 355th flip-flop over the last 16 years''.
O'Leary decided that Mueller, now five months in the job, had become sufficiently familiar with his new role to merit 
the same criticism as previous incumbents.
''New management announcing the same old strategy, but its impact on us will be capacity cuts in Belfast, which 
will be to our benefit, capacity cuts in Gatwick and they are now following the same hybrid strategy pioneered 
successfully over the years by people like British Midland and Air Berlin," he said.
''It's not a low-fare airline and it's not a high service airline, it's some in-between. It's an airline but not as we know it. 
Doomed to failure again, but God bless them and all who sail with them."
As for suggestions from Mueller that Ryanair's low-fare strategy could not continue as it relied on the post-
September 11 cheap aircraft deal with Boeing, O'Leary was not convinced.
''Everybody is getting out of our way, which is a good-sense strategy from their point of view, because we have an 
enormous cost advantage over everybody else.
''I think if there is one message I would take out of the Q3 numbers today, it's that Ryanair, with the lowest unit cost 
in Europe, is still reducing costs. . .on an adjusted basis by more than 5 per cent this year.
''But almost every other airline in Europe is seeing unit costs rising and bleating on about how their costs are 
uncontrollable, but they are going to move to a better model and that the Ryanair model isn't sustainable.
O'Leary pours scorn on Aer Lingus 'flip-flop'
''We've been at this for 25 years, so I don't want to be lectured by people who are in new jobs less than kind of six 
months or two years. . . I don't pay too much attention to these geniuses telling me how unsustainable the Ryanair 
model is."
O'Leary returned to familiar territory as he announced third quarter pre-tax losses of  12.5 million, beating analyst 
forecasts as passenger numbers increased by 14 per cent to 16 million and revenue nudged ahead 1 per cent to  
612 million. At the heart of the improved bottom line were fresh inroads into the costbase, as O'Leary built on a 
favourable movement in oil prices with further reductions in unit costs.
This appeared to be achieved largely at the expense of airport operators, as Ryanair hammered out new deals on 
landing charges with stressed airports looking to O'Leary to fill the gaps left by a series of airline collapses and 
route reductions last year.
''Capacity cuts by many of Europe's flag carriers has led to traffic falls at most EU airports.
''This has created opportunity for us to grow, as many of these airports compete vigorously against each other to 
persuade Ryanair to expand there," O'Leary said.
Per-passenger airport and handling charges fell by 11 per cent, despite O'Leary's renewed attacks on airport 
authorities at Dublin and London's Stansted over their pricing policies.
He said the results were ''marginally'' ahead of expectations on the back of new routes and new bases that helped 
arrest the decline in yields from a feared 20 per cent to a more palatable 12 per cent.
He said the more benign yield outlook was likely to continue throughout the final quarter (to the end of March) and 
increased full-year profit guidance from above  200 million to the region of  275 million.
But he warned that high costs at Irish airports would take their toll on Ryanair's future route planning. ''The Irish 
routes are the least profitable routes we have because they are the highest-cost ones," he said.
Instead, he aimed to deploy extra capacity to Spain in an effort to overtake Spanish flag carrier Iberia's position as 
number one in that market.
O'Leary also reiterated the importance of having a significant cost advantage during a recession, which meant 
Ryanair could continue to undercut rivals while at the same time operating above breakeven on individual routes.
''We're doing remarkably well, because this is the time when the lowest cost producer wins."
But the stand-off with Boeing over new aircraft continued, with O'Leary saying talks were at an end and that he 
would not come back to the table unless the US aviation giant offered materially better terms than last time.
The signs are, however, that Boeing is in no mood for blinking first - a move that will force O'Leary to match his talk 
of pursuing an alternative strategy with action, and opting to return cash to shareholders instead of reinvesting in 
growing his fleet.

EMI seeks funds
If consumers do not pay for their music, Terra Firma may have to.
Guy Hands, founder and chairman of Terra Firma, this week went to investors in two of its private equity funds to 
ask for another £120m to help EMI's recorded music business meet the terms of its loan with Citigroup.
While the music, which includes the Beatles and Robbie Williams, will not stop, accountants at the record label 
raised "significant doubt" that EMI will survive.
Even if the investors cough up the cash, EMI is set to face a similar crisis next year as it risks breaking its 
covenants again in March 2011.
If that was not enough to give Mr Hands a headache, Terra Firma is suing Citigroup for wrongly claiming that there 
was a rival bidder - which it believes led to it paying the inflated price of £4bn for the company in 2007.
Shell profits dive
As fourth-quarter profits fell 75 per cent at Royal Dutch Shell on Thursday because of a poor performance in its 
refinery business, Peter Voser, chief executive, said: "We simply have to do better."
Mr Voser's solution was more belt-tightening - axing refining capacity by 15 per cent, cutting staff bonuses by up to 
12 per cent and scrapping 1,000 more jobs.
Two days earlier, BP saw a 70 per cent rise in underlying profits, after it cut 7,500 jobs and sold US service 
stations, but still came in below analysts' expectations.
The message at BP was broadly the same. Tony Hayward, chief executive, chose the words "slow and gradual" to 
describe the recovery in the US and European markets.
Airlines fly higher
The big stories
Both British Airways and Ryanair were flying relatively high this week after they announced surprisingly good 
results.
Ryanair raised its full-year profit guidance and reported a smaller loss than had been forecast. The airline survived 
the bad weather and saw demand return in some parts of Europe, though there were still fewer flyers in the UK and 
Ireland.
There was perhaps even more surprising news from BA, which reported its first quarterly operating profit in more 
than a year after a cost-cutting programme.
It benefited from resolving a pension deficit and cutting staff.
New Look IPO
New Look this week switched its focus from selling dresses to selling itself as it announced its intention to re-float 
on the London Stock Exchange.
The fashion retailer, which was bought by private equity group Permira and Apax Partners with founder Tom Singh 
in 2004 for £800m, wants to take advantage of calmer markets to raise about £650m to pay down debt and fund 
expansion.
But while the IPO was touted as a bellwether for investor sentiment, it remains to be seen whether buyers will 
queue up - because it has a not-so-bargain basement price-tag, which would give it an enterprise value of £1.7bn.

Irish shares fell further this morning as world markets continued to tumble on fears for the stability of the eurozone.

The ISEQ plummeted again today with concerns about the ability of Greece to meet its sovereign debt liability have

The ISEQ plummeted again today with concerns about the ability of Greece to meet its sovereign debt liability have 
now spread to include Portugal and, most worryingly, Spain.
The index fell 61.19 points to 2,890.11.
CDS spreads on the debt of 15 Western European countries have now risen above the 100 basis points level for 
the first time. Equity investors consequently took fright as European exchanges suffered their worst day in almost 
three months, while US markets had their worst day in nine months.
European shares fell for a third day on Friday, and notched up their worst weekly performance in 11 months, with 
banks extending recent declines, on intensified worries about eurozone sovereign debt. The pan-European 
FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares fell 1.9pc to end provisionally at 974.39 points, the lowest close since early 
November of last year. Over the week, the index fell 3.7pc, its worst weekly performance since last March. It is 
down 9.3pc from the 15-month high it hit on Jan 11. European policymakers scrambled on Friday to reassure 
markets on the stability of their 16-nation currency bloc as investors shed euro assets for a second day on fears 
about debt-laden member states like Greece and Portugal. Banks took the most points off the index. BNP Paribas, 
HSBC , Lloyds Banking Group and Societe Generale fell between 1.2 and 5.5pc. Shares fell across the board in 
Dublin with AIB down 5c to E1.10, Bank of Ireland dropped 3c to E1.19 and Irish Life and Permanent gained 8c to 
E3.09. Among the other big fallers were CRH - the biggest share listing on the ISEQ by market cap - which fell 29c 
to E17.12 despite some slightly better than expected US economic data on Friday. Kerry Group fell 10c to E20.60 
and Elan was down 15c to E5.22 amid concerns over side effects of its key Tysabri MS drug treatment. Shares in 
Aer Lingus were flat at E0.66. Davy are keeping their forecast of an operating loss of E84.1m in 2009 for the airline 
(operating profit of E8.8m in H2). "For 2010 and 2011, we assume an operating loss of E19.8m (previously E64m) 
and profit of E17.1m in 2011 (previously a loss of E21m) as the cost savings start to flow through." On net bases,

the broker sees the airline returning to profit in 2011. "A key determinant will be yield performance - we currently 
assume negative yields arrest after H1 FY2010 and are flat thereafter; however, the company will likely look to push 
up yields in both short and long haul this summer." Ryanair shares dropped 9c to E3.37. The frozen bakery division 
of Ralcorp Holdings had a quite extraordinary Q1, Davy said. Revenues were down by 4.8pc year-on-year, net 
volume was down by 1pc but profit contribution rose by 76pc and margin almost doubled to 14.5pc. The division 
has some similarities to ARYZTA's US operations. The Irish firm's shares fell 20c to E28.00.

The ISEQ shares index plunged below the 3,000 mark yet again with banks the primary culprit as analysts try to 
forecast prospects for the top two listed banks post NAMA and worry over the health of the US recovery.
Irish shares were not the only ones to suffer. A surprise rise in US jobless claims - ahead of the key non-farm 
payroll numbers tomorrow - sent a shudder through the markets, with miners and banks the major casualties.
With Wall Street falling around 190 points by the time London closed, the FTSE 100 finished down 113.84 points at 
5139.31, its lowest level since November 5 last year and its biggest one day decline for more than two months.
Banks were the biggest drag in Dublin. Investors should get greater clarity on the capital requirements and earnings 
potential of the Irish banks as the key uncertainties around NAMA and the EC's response to restructuring are 
resolved this quarter, according to Davy's expert, Emer :Lang. She said that a re-focus on medium-term profit 
potential would help capital raisings to achieve core equity ratios of 6pc at end-2010. Higher capital targets and the 
extension of credit to a fragile economy are conflicting objectives, she said. "We therefore see higher targets being 
achieved over time. We are raising our guarantee charge for the banks to reflect the higher cost and our 
assumption that corporate deposits will remain covered to safeguard against outflows. Our margin analysis 
indicates that the banks are loss-making on some current product offerings due to their higher cost of funds and 
capital requirements." Shares in AIB fell by 6c to E1.17, Bank of Ireland dropped by 9c to E1.22 and Irish Life and 
Permanent declined 10c to E3.00. Beacon Roofing Supplies, which distributes roofing and siding products in the US 
and is a competitor of CRH's Allied Distribution business, reported Q4 results which were behind forecasts. 
Revenues in the quarter were down over 20pc on the same period last year at dollar 368m (dollar 393m expected), 
while earnings per share declined to 17c (with 18.7c expected) - a fall of 59pc from the fourth quarter of last year. 
Shares in CRH plunged 26c to E17.40. Ryanair released traffic statistics yesterday afternoon, posting a 9pc annual 
ISEQ plunges amid US economy worry ISEQ Falls
increase in passengers in January to 4.44m passengers (following a 12pc increase in December). This gives us 
comfort in our estimates of passenger numbers for the airline's fiscal fourth quarter, as Goodbody Stockbrokers 
have predicted growth of 9pc pencilled in for the quarter (capacity growth of 8pc), bringing the full year outturn to 
13pc, and followed by a 10pc increase in 2011. Ryanair shares fell by 2c to E3.50. The UK pub chain, Smith and 
Fuller, saw 2.6pc like-for-like sales in its managed pubs and hotels in the 11 weeks to end January. While it had 
enjoyed record sales in December, the momentum was dented by the recent bad weather. The company remains 
cautious on the outlook for the UK consumer but remains confident on its own prospects. For C and C, the 
background remains a difficult one in the UK and growth in sales and volumes this year will be determined by its 
own initiatives rather than by general market growth. Shares in the Irish drinks group rose 17c to E19.92.

Body
The ISEQ rose steadily this morning but gains were limited by concerns over the strength of the US recovery.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 28.07 points to 3,009.54.
US stocks charged higher last night as Wall Street kicked off a new month energised by strong earnings from oil 
giant ExxonMobil and a robust reading on US manufacturing activity. However, the USD1.5 trillion US budget deficit 
left investors worried that the US Government will have little leg room to stimulate the economy again in the near 
future.
US construction activity was weaker than expected in December. According to the Department of Commerce, the 
value of construction put in place fell 1.2pc on a seasonally adjusted rate compared to November. A decline of 
0.6pc was expected. Reflecting the challenging environment for building activity in the US, construction spending in 
December was 9.9pc lower than December 2008. Shares in CRH gained 14c to E17.60. DCC has issued an upbeat 
interim management statement in which management has confirmed that trading in its key divisions has improved 
since the company's last update in November. DCC Energy experienced mixed trading conditions in terms of 
weather in Q3 but has unsurprisingly had a very strong January given the extended cold spell. Integration synergies 
from recently announced deals have also boosted earnings. Sercom Distribution enjoyed a strong Christmas 
trading period, with the retailer and reseller business performing well, while Sercom Solutions experienced a decline 
in operating profit. Encouragingly, operating profit in the other three divisions was ahead of the prior year in Q3 with 
a strong rebound in profits in both Healthcare and Environmental Services. DCC's shares rose 35c to E20.40. 
Independent News & Media's (INM) Indian associate, Jagran Prakashan (JPL), yesterday (February 1st) reported 
results for its third quarter to December 2009. It reported operating revenue of E33.0m, which represented an 
increase of 9.6pc over the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The profit after tax came in at E5.8m, an 
increase of 156.9pc over the corresponding quarter of the previous year, and the EPS for the quarter was Rs1.32. 
ISEQ up but gains limited by economy ISEQ Up
EBITDA margin (excluding other income) for the quarter was 28.8pc versus 14.5pc for the same quarter of the 
previous year. Shares in the Irish group were flat at E0.10. Shares in Ryanair edged up 1c to E3.58. Goodbody 
Stockbrokers said the yield performance in the third quarter results (net income -E11m compared to E40m forecast) 
is "unequivocally positive". "The yield decline in the second quarter at -20pc firmly turned in the right direction in Q3 
(-12pc yoy). Guidance for Q4 is for declines of 7-10pc, however, we feel the easy comps from last year (-24pc yoy 
in Q409) could see the outturn closer to -3pc."

Highlight: Full-year profit guidance raised
Plans for 146 new routes during 2010
Body
Ryanair yesterday said it saw no sign of a pick-up in demand in Ireland or the UK, unlike many other countries on 
the continent.
The comments from Europe's largest low-cost airline came as it raised full-year profit guidance and reported a 
much smaller-than-expected third-quarter net loss, sending its shares up 7 per cent.
"We're seeing demand return, not quite to pre-2009 levels yet, in places like Germany, Scandinavia, Italy, France 
and Spain. They're moving back up," said Michael Cawley, deputy chief executive of Ryanair. "In Britain, 
particularly in provincial Britain, and Ireland, there's no sign of that yet."
Ryanair said its quarterly net loss was EUR10.9m ($15.1m) and that its yields, or average fare levels, had been 
better than expected, which should continue into the fourth quarter.
"As a consequence, we have now increased our full-year net profit guidance to EUR275m," said Michael O'Leary, 
Ryanair chief executive, who added that conditions for airlines were "still pretty tough". The airline had previously 
forecast its full-year net profit would be at the lower end of the EUR200m-EUR300m range.
"The environment out there is, from Ryanair's perspective, great, because it's awful," Mr O'Leary told analysts. 
"We're doing remarkably well because this is the time when the lowest cost producer wins. That doesn't mean the 
world has changed and everything is fantastic."
Yields at Ryanair still fell by 12 per cent over the quarter but this was an improvement on the 20 per cent fall it had 
previously forecast. The airline said it thought the full-year yield decline would now be closer to 15 per cent, not the 
20 per cent it had predicted.
The improvement had come as Ryanair cut loss-making routes in the UK and Ireland and replaced them with more 
profitable ones in France, Germany and Spain.
Ryanair says it sees no sign of UK pick-up
It also managed to cut operating costs per passenger by 4 per cent, even though it saw a 3 per cent increase in 
average flight distance, which normally pushes costs up.
Mr Cawley said Ryanair planned to open 146 new routes in 2010 and would see "unprecedented" passenger 
growth, with 66m passengers this year and an estimated 73m in 2011.
Joe Gill, analyst for Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, said the results were very promising. "In producing numbers 
like these, Ryanair will reignite optimism among those who believe the planned EUR800m profit in 2012 can be 
achieved," he said.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair expected to increase market share as a result of the demise of several carriers in the past 
few months. "We expect further casualties this winter," he added.
Its shares rose 7 per cent to EUR3.58.

Airlines and banks performed well yesterday, allowing European shares to bounce bank from the their biggest 
monthly loss in almost a year.
Airline stocks were higher, lifted by broker upgrades as the sector began announcing earnings and traffic data.
Irish airline Ryanair rose 6.7 per cent to EUR3.57, after the company raised its full-year profit forecast and reported 
narrower-thanexpected third-quarter losses. Ryanair shares reached their highest levels in more than four months.
Europe's biggest low-cost airline said that, although market conditions remained tough, the company was still 
gaining market share from leading European carriers Lufthansa, Air France and British Airways. Lufthansa added 
1.3 per cent to EUR11.77 and Air France rose 1.5 per cent to EUR12.01, benefiting from a Goldman Sachs 
upgrade of the European airline sector.
Meanwhile, merger hopes also helped lift the sector, as the planned global tie-up between Iberia, BA and American 
Airlines moved closer to securing a regulatory green light in Europe. Iberia gained 2.2 per cent to EUR2.25. Finnair  
rose 1.8 per cent to EUR3.90 and Ireland's Aer Lingus  was up 4.5 per cent to EUR0.69.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 closed 0.5 per cent higher at 1,017.30.
Banks extended Friday's gains. Banco Santander  added 1.9 per cent to EUR10.37, Credit Suisse rose 2.9 per 
cent to SFr 47.89 and Deutsche Bank gained 2.9 per cent to EUR45.65. UBS  fell initially following concerns about 
the country's economic situation and fears that its US banking licence could be revoked as a result of its unresolved 
US tax dispute. But by the end of the day's trade, its shares were up 1.3 per cent at EUR14.21.
French media group Vivendi SA lost 2.4 per cent to EUR18.39 after a US jury found the company liable for 
potentially billions of dollars in damages for misleading investors about the company's financial condition before a 
$46bn merger nearly 10 years ago.

Man Group   joined a London market rally yesterday as the FTSE 100 put in its best performance in a month.
Shares in the hedge fund manager rebounded from its lowest since May after Shore Capital dismissed concerns 
that Man's benchmark AHL futures fund is broken.
AHL last year reported its first annual loss due to the effects of quantitative easing, which damped the market 
trends that the fund would usually ride, Shore said.
Investors are remaining confident that, once stimulus packages have wound down, the performance will recover, it 
added.
The broker also argued that, while new customers will be put off by AHL's losses, existing ones are likely to add to 
funds in the hope of mean reversion.
"There can be no guarantees that AHL's negative performance will end tomorrow but we do detect a belief from 
AHL that the investment environment will better suit their clean clear managed futures model in 2010 than it did in 
2009," analyst Phil Dobbin said.
Man shares closed higher by 3 per cent to 244¼p with the move also helped by some speculative theories.
One story doing the rounds was that Man might consider bidding for a rival UK hedge fund such as Marshall Wace.
After an uncertain start, the FTSE 100 followed Wall Street to close up 1.1 per cent at 5,247.41, a gain of 58.89 
points.
The rally was powered by recent underperformers such as Barclays , up 4.3 per cent to 282¼p, and Royal Bank 
of Scotland , ahead 7.9 per cent to 34¾p.
Man joins overall rally after hedge fund reassurance
Insurers found support after the European regulator published late on Friday a feedback document that eased some 
of its previously proposed capital requirements.
Legal & General  was the main beneficiary, rising 3.8 per cent to 77¾p.
Break-up speculation helped Vedanta Resources  gain 5.2 per cent to £25.53 with the Indian mining group said to 
be looking at spinning off its copper and aluminium subsidiaries.
Utilities jumped after a press report revived hopes that Northumbrian Water could face a bid from its biggest 
shareholder, Ontario Teachers.
Neither group would comment and analysts were cautious of the story.
Nevertheless, traders were encouraged by a suggested 325p-a-share price- tag, which would value Northumbrian 
at about a 13 per cent premium to its regulatory asset base compared with a sector trading at about par value.
Northumbrian closed up 11.8 per cent to 289p. Severn Trent rose 4 per cent to £11.70 in tandem while United 
Utilities added 2.8 per cent to 551½p and Pennon rose 5 per cent to 540p.
Better-than-expected earnings from Ryanair helped lift British Airways , which reports on Friday, by 3.3 per cent to 
213p.
Its shares were also aided by Goldman Sachs "buy" advice. The broker argued that BA's merger with Iberia may be 
completed ahead of schedule and should come with deep job cuts on both sides.
Retail stocks found support amid gossip about potential buy-out fund interest in the sector.
Home Retail Group , one name linked to the tale, was up 2.2 per cent to 261½p.
Schroders led the blue-chip fallers, down 2.8 per cent to £12.11, after Credit Suisse downgraded to "neutral" and 
forecast a near halving of fourth-quarter fund inflows.
Among the mid-caps, Cranswick  gained 2.6 per cent to 755p after the pork supplier reported better- than-expected 
sales. There was also positive trading news from SThree, the recruitment agency, which added 2.5 per cent to 
312½p.
Close Brothers was up 2.4 per cent to 709p following a press report that Nomura might bid £500m for its 
Winterflood market-making business. But Close management told investors that there had been no approach and 
people familiar with Nomura played down suggestions that the bank was interested.
Chaucer added 0.5 per cent to 46p on renewed rumours that it was a potential target for fellow Lloyds insurer Ascot 
Underwriting. Analysts cautioned that such a deal might be classed a reverse takeover.

There are perhaps only three things extravagant about Ryanair: its appetite for cost cuts; its valuation; and its ability 
to generate cash. The first saw Europe's largest budget airline turn in a better-than-forecast set of results yesterday. 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, continued to chop out expenses during the third quarter - mostly from staff and 
airport charges. As a result, passenger yields fell less than expected, so too profits, and Mr O'Leary boosted 
earnings guidance for the year to EUR275m versus earlier forecasts closer to EUR200m. The shares leapt by more 
than 7 per cent.
Then there is the Dublin-based carrier's valuation. At 19 times earnings, or about twice book value, Ryanair does 
not enjoy a hefty premium to the broader European market, which trades at about 17 times 2009 earnings. The 
stock even suffers a discount to its historic price-to-book average of about 2.7 times, according to Credit Suisse. 
Nonetheless, this represents a whopping premium to most European airlines. If there is value to be had, it is only 
relative.
Finally there is Ryanair's ability to spew out cash. Until recently, this was veiled by its rapid growth. Indeed, with 
about 10 per cent of the European market, there is still room for Ryanair to grow further. After all, Southwest 
Airlines, the US budget carrier on which Ryanair's model is based, has 18 per cent of its home market. But Ryanair 
recently had a change of heart after a rumpus with Boeing , and money once destined to be spent on 200 new 
planes will be returned to shareholders - as much as EUR1bn by 2014. With a fair wind, Ryanair could conceivably 
have another EUR1bn to distribute by 2016. That would make EUR2bn handed back to investors over six years, a 
40 per cent yield. That is pretty extravagant too.

Highlight: News analysis
Analysts are unsure about the prospects for the no-frills carriers - despite the sector's smiles, says Kevin Brown 
Body
As aviation executives gather for the annual Singapore air show, which gets under way today, it is easy to spot the 
people who run the Asia-Pacific region's low-cost carriers - they are the ones who are smiling.
The global background is grim. Giovanni Bisignani, director-general of the International Air Transport Association, 
forecast in Singapore yesterday that global revenues would fall by $60bn this year on top of $80bn in 2009.
Full service carriers every-where are struggling to stay afloat, with Japan Airlines succumbing to bankruptcy only 
last month. In contrast, the region's low-cost airline sector is buzzing with passenger growth and expansion plans.
Singapore's Tiger Airways, which has just completed the first initial public offering of an Asian airline in five years, 
yesterday announced its 21st consecutive quarter of increased passenger growth.
Meanwhile, Malaysia's AirAsiaplans to add five Indian cities this year to the four it serves already, and Cebu Pacific 
of the Philippines is claiming its fifth successive year of 30 per cent growth in passengers.
All are profitable, along with many of the region's 20 or so other no-frills airlines, which have sprung up in the past 
decade as the low-cost airline model spread globally from its origins in the US in the 1970s.
The underlying drivers of the boom for low-cost carriers appear to be in place: rapid growth in gross domestic 
product, estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 5.8 per cent across the region for 2010, and gradual route 
liberalisation, which allows airlines to fly to more destinations.
"With growth in GDP per capita you are going to have a brand new population of potential passengers who may 
soon be able to fly, and that is going to create the fastest growing aviation market - and the biggest market - in the 
world," says Chad Parker, a Hong Kong-based Morgan Stanley banker.
'Profitless growth' of low-cost airlines in Asia pounced on
In spite of the low-cost sector's dynamism, some analysts argue the smiles on executives' faces may be disguised 
grimaces.
Chris Tarry, a veteran UK-based aviation analyst, says the low-cost carriers can attract passengers easily as GDP 
rises, by constantly expanding to new destinations. But they face a constant threat of competition from new entrants 
who can start flying with a couple of leased aircraft.
"There is growth and there is a thing in the airline industry called profitless growth, and that is what most of them 
have," says Mr Tarry.
He says that only three low-cost airlines are probably making money on a sustainable basis - Ryanair and EasyJet 
in Europe and AirAsia, set up in 2001 by Tony Fernandes, the Malaysian entrepreneur who was one of the first to 
spot the potential of low-cost operations in Asia.
For the moment, many of the Asian no-frills carriers are declaring profits. AirAsia booked a net profit of M$130m 
(US$37m) for the quarter to September, and Cebu Pacific posted net income of 1.8bn pesos ($38m) for the first half 
of 2009. Tiger, part-owned by Singapore Airlines, says it makes money from the low-cost operation out of 
Singapore but suffered a S$50.8m (US$36m) loss for the year to March 2009 because of start-up costs in Australia.
Moreover, airline bosses themselves are divided about the way forward. Tony Davis, chief executive of Tiger, says 
the key to success remains the pure low-cost business model, with "no frills" services on single-leg flights.
"We follow the Sam Walton model," Mr Davis told a conference on the low-cost airline sector ahead of the air show, 
referring to Walmart, the US retailer. "Death, taxes and lower air fares are the only three certain things in life."
Brett Godfrey, founder and chief executive of Australia's Virgin Blue, says the sector faces an inevitable decline in 
fare yields as markets mature, which will force them to chase higher yields by competing with the full service 
carriers.
Virgin Blue has begun to chase higher yields by introducing network services, transferring passengers' bags 
between flights, and adding premium seating and refundable fares. The airline is considering introducing aircraft 
with three classes of seating.
"We made a bucketload of money and it worked very well for a long time," Mr Godfrey says. "But to succeed in the 
future low-cost will be [no more than] the price for a place at the table, no longer a guarantee of a winning hand. We 
have to take a more flexible approach."

European shares fell in early trade this morning, with banks coming under pressure and mining shares tracking 
lower metals prices.
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was down 0.7 percent early on at 1,005.10 points.
In January, the index suffered its worst monthly loss since February 2009, knocked lower by mounting worries over 
Greece's debt woes and the prospect of more regulation on the banking system.
"The market is just worried about the things that have been going on over the past few weeks," said Bernard 
McAlinden, market strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. "There is apprehension about the possibility of tightening (in 
China) and problems of the peripheral economies in the euro zone." On the macro front, China's manufacturing 
powered ahead in January, providing more evidence of its robust economic health to markets. Miners came under 
pressure from lower metals prices. BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata fell 0.3 to 0.4 percent. Banks were down, with 
UBS, UniCredit and BNP Paribas and Banco Santander falling 0.3 to 1.9 percent. Irish airline Ryanair rose 5.6 
percent as the company increased its profit forecast for the year after posting a narrower-than-expected third-
quarter net loss.

A near 8pc surge in Ryanair's shares helped keep the ISEQ out of negative territory this morning.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 3.19 points to 2,979.44.
Ryanair raised its profit forecast and said an industry slump it has exploited to expand rapidly at the expense of less 
nimble rivals is set to continue, sending its shares sharply higher. "Generally we're quite positive on recession," 
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said. "At this point there is really no sign (of an) end yet." Europe's 
biggest low-cost airline led blue chip gainers after it said it is still gaining market share from the continent's leading 
flag carriers Air France-KLM and British Airways -- which have signalled their business is stabilising -- and 
Deutsche Lufthansa. It also said fares were declining less than anticipated after it cut loss-making winter capacity 
and replaced it with more promising new routes. Ryanair, which in December broke off talks with Boeing on a 
potential order of up to 200 aircraft, said it was still planning to scale back investments from 2013, when it could 
start returning cash to shareholders. The airline's shares rose by 19c to E3.54.
There was speculation at the weekend suggesting that there could be further delays to the introduction of NAMA. 
According to the reports the target date to begin buying the loans, February 12, could be delayed as they are still 
awaiting approval from the European Commission. With an IMS due from Bank of Ireland in the coming weeks and 
the full year releases from AIB and ILP on the week beginning March 1, there will be a constant flow of news on the 
topic of NAMA over the coming few weeks, said Goodbody Stockbrokers. Shares in AIB dropped 5c to E1.24, Bank 
of Ireland declined by 6c to E1.27 and Irish Life and Permanent rose 10c to E3.20. Cranswick, the UK fresh meats 
producer, said today that it saw organic growth of 17pc in the past quarter on 2009. Strong sales growth was 
recorded in bacon sausages and cooked meats, all of which are important product lines for Kerry group in the UK. 
Its performance was assisted by the acquisition in June of CCF Norfolk. We expect that Kerry is also seeing some 
positive momentum in its UK operations (the UK accounts for about 33pc of Kerry Foods' business) though we 
believe Ireland remains difficult. Kerry's shares fell 38c to E21.05. Looking at prospects for Elan's Tysabri, Davy

monitoring standards increase (especially in Europe). Elan's shares fell 11c to E5.37.

Body
A near 8pc surge in Ryanair's shares helped keep the ISEQ out of negative territory this morning.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 3.19 points to 2,979.44.
Ryanair raised its profit forecast and said an industry slump it has exploited to expand rapidly at the expense of less 
nimble rivals is set to continue, sending its shares sharply higher. "Generally we're quite positive on recession," 
Ryanair Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar said. "At this point there is really no sign (of an) end yet." Europe's 
biggest low-cost airline led blue chip gainers after it said it is still gaining market share from the continent's leading 
flag carriers Air France-KLM and British Airways -- which have signalled their business is stabilising -- and 
Deutsche Lufthansa. It also said fares were declining less than anticipated after it cut loss-making winter capacity 
and replaced it with more promising new routes. Ryanair, which in December broke off talks with Boeing on a 
potential order of up to 200 aircraft, said it was still planning to scale back investments from 2013, when it could 
start returning cash to shareholders. The airline's shares rose by 19c to E3.54.
There was speculation at the weekend suggesting that there could be further delays to the introduction of NAMA. 
According to the reports the target date to begin buying the loans, February 12, could be delayed as they are still 
awaiting approval from the European Commission. With an IMS due from Bank of Ireland in the coming weeks and 
the full year releases from AIB and ILP on the week beginning March 1, there will be a constant flow of news on the 
topic of NAMA over the coming few weeks, said Goodbody Stockbrokers. Shares in AIB dropped 5c to E1.24, Bank
