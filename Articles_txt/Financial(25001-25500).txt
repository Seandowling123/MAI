Irish shares followed a general European trend lower in early dealings today.
Both main banks were in the red as investors take stock of their prospects and those of the economy.
A downbeat forecast from the ESRI suggested this morning that economic growth will not take hold here until late 
next year.
The ISEQ index was down 53.54 points a short time ago at 3,314.00. AIB has shed 6c to 299, while Bank of Ireland 
is off by 9c to 305. Irish Life and Permanent is up 4c, however, to 562. Other big names are mostly lower, with CRH 
down 35c to 1962 and bakery group Aryzta dipping 19c to 2670. Kerry is off by 12c to 1987, with Ryanair dropping 
3c to 342. United Drug is down 6c to 227.

Body
Ryanair has backtracked on its claim that it no longer interested in taking over Aer Lingus.
The budget carrier's chief executive has made clear that its interest is still very much alive.
In an interview, Michael O'Leary has predicted that the government will in due course ask Ryanair to take over Aer 
Lingus.
O'Leary also made clear yesterday that Ryanair sees Aer Lingus as a potential vehicle to buy the ailing carrier bmi 
from Lufthansa. "Why couldn't Aer Lingus buy bmi and expand at Heathrow," Michael O'Leary asked in an 
interview. Mr O'Leary's would then see Aer Lingus would then continue to fly into primary airports like Heathrow and 
Paris Charles de Gaulle, with Ryanair servicing "secondary" airports. Lufthansa has said it was considering various 
options, ranging from continuing bmi's operations to selling the company. Aer Lingus this week told staff it would 
have to axe more than 600 jobs or face a downward spiral of selling assets that would ultimately threaten its 
survival as an independent airline. It said it would base much of its future growth on expansion in the UK, including 
London and Belfast, while cutting costlier jobs in the Republic of Ireland. Mr O'Leary said that, is Aer Lingus keeps 
slashing costs and fails to grow, the government would eventually ask it to bail out the former state carrier. "If they 
continue down this road of constant restructuring programmes, constant job cuts and no growth the government will 
ultimately be forced to come to Ryanair and ask it to rescue it," he said. The airline has struggled to compete with 
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline and one of the most cost-efficient players in the industry. Ryanair, still 
growing profit unlike rivals such as British Airways, has twice tried to take Aer Lingus over and earlier this year saw 
a bid at 1.4 euros a share rejected by the government, which owns 25 percent of the airline. Ryanair has hit out at 
Aer Lingus management over 670 planned job cuts claiming its audacious takeover would have had the reverse 
effect. The budget airline demanded the Government explains why it rejected a failed 750 million euro buy-out with 
a commitment to double the short-haul fleet and hire hundreds of new staff. Ryanair, which has a 29pc stake in the

former State carrier, claimed it could have created 1,000 jobs at Aer Lingus while reducing fares and securing its

fall over the weekend receded.
The index climbed 21.40 points to 3,367.54.
On Saturday, the Green Party endorsed the Programme for Government and rejected a motion opposing the setting 
up of NAMA by 69 per cent to 31 per cent. "The result should mean that NAMA is virtually certain to be passed in 
Parliament later this month as the government has the requisite support it needs, failing a mutiny in its ranks," Davy

this week with the third, or committee stage, due to kick off on Tuesday 20th. It is still envisaged that NAMA will 
become law by the end of the month."
Shares in AIB rose by 2c to E3.06, Bank of Ireland gained 1c to E3.15 and Irish Life and Permanent fell by 12c to 
E5.58. Shares in CRH jumped 21c to E19.71. The value of US highway construction put-in-place is up 8.4pc year-
to-date to end-September, according to the latest data from US officials. This makes it one of the strongest 
construction end-markets in the US this year. With construction costs running lower this year, all of the increase 
represents higher volumes. There was a sharp worsening of business conditions in the Irish construction sector

It is hard to fathom what has been happening with Irish bank stocks in recent months. Sure, they were probably 
oversold when they hit rock bottom, but the fact that they have managed to stay at current levels is extraordinary.
This is particularly true of AIB. After Brian Lenihan announced details on the estimated price to be paid by Nama for 
loans, both Bank of Ireland and AIB's shares rose.
The enthusiasm seemed to be based on punters backing the stock, rather than serious institutional investors getting 
in for the long haul.
Last week, they had lost pretty much all of those gains, as the stock drifted back to pre-Nama announcement levels. 
Merrion Stockbrokers came out with a note suggesting that AIB and Bank of Ireland needed a combined  9 billion in 
fresh capital to reach an 8 per cent tier one capital ratio.
According to Merrion, they don't need that right away, but they will have to get it from somewhere.
Even allowing that some of it could come from future profits and hybrid capital fundraising, it is hard to avoid the 
conclusion that the state will end up taking a very large stake in AIB, in particular.
But those share prices are holding up. Maybe the market has already factored in all of the worst news and a 
massive, state-inspired dilution.
Or perhaps the stock is being driven by punters with a short term view, willing to take a risk this week and a profit 
next week.
Row settled
A tussle between Ryanair and proxy voting company Manifest seems to have been settled now, with Manifest 
claiming victory in its complaints against the Irish airline. Manifest, which advises shareholders on corporate 
Comment
governance issues, had a few bones to pick with Ryanair, dubbing it one of the most shareholder-unfriendly 
companies around.
It claimed that the company, which calls itself 'Britain's favourite airline', wasn't fully complying with its obligations 
under listing rules.
Ryanair gives the impression that its not too perturbed by Manifest's mini-campaign but they seem to have rectified 
the shareholder advisory firm's concerns in any case.
In early September, Manifest filed a complaint with the Irish Stock Exchange against Ryanair noting that while 
ProvisionD.2.2 of the Combined Code recommends disclosure of the proxies lodged at general meetings on a 
website, that Ryanair had failed to do so.
Manifest received an acknowledgement of the complaint from the Irish Stock Exchange, although no indication was 
made as to any formal actions by the exchange.
''A visit to Ryanair's website this morning revealed that the proxies lodged in respect of the two AGMs and one 
EGM held during the period after the implementation of the revised Combined Code were now available on the 
Ryanair investor relations website," Manifest said on its daily blog last week.
Manifest welcomed Ryanair's compliance with the code, claiming that ''investor confidence in the 'comply or explain' 
principle would be boosted following the successful outcome of the complaint.

The next few weeks will reveal whether new chief executive Christoph Mueller will succeed as an irresistible force 
where predecessor Dermot Mannion failed. We will also find out whether trade unions and the government will 
continue in their roles as immovable objects on the road to whipping the airline onto shape.
After just a month in the job, Mueller has already made his first decisive move. Where Mannion had to contend with 
months of unavoidable sweet talking to staff and the government in the run-up to Aer Lingus's IPO, the new man 
has clearly decided against letting a good crisis go to waste.
He had little choice. After an ugly year in 2008, during which the airline racked up losses of  120 million, some 
estimates put the bottom line as low as  150 million in the red this year.
The alarming rate at which Aer Lingus is eating into its cash pile - estimated to fall from  800 million two years ago 
to little more than  100 million by the end of next year - serves as a doomsday clock that is counting down the 
airline's slide into oblivion.
Mueller's mission to arrest the decline is straightforward: knock  100 million off costs and then proceed to add  100 
million to revenues. But the extent of the challenge is perhaps best viewed in context - a Mannion initiative to shave  
20 million off the annual cost bill, begun in 2007, is still in progress.
The latest battle has begun in an all-too predictable fashion: management appears confident, the unions grumble 
over almost 700 proposed job losses and staff are paraded through the broadcast media to tug emotionally at the 
public's heartstrings.
Mueller's grim debut
Mueller will, at least, have the benefit of unclouded judgment when it comes to paying many categories of staff 
more than other airlines do, maintaining unprofitable operations at Shannon Airport and flirting with an 
unsustainable pension arrangement. Last week's board statements suggested he was already having an effect.
''Aer Lingus cannot survive in a situation where staff are paid significantly more and operate less efficiently than 
comparable positions at peers. Aer Lingus must rationalise work practices - in the air, on the ground and in support 
staff areas - to introduce best practice processes and procedures, and at least match its competitors in terms of 
productivity. In addition, Aer Lingus's operational flexibility cannot continue to be held back by restrictive practices 
that date from the past."
Staff who had feared the impact of a Ryanair takeover on their working lives would do well to take comfort from 
sentiments such as these, which could just as easily have been delivered from the office of Michael O'Leary, the 
chief executive of the low-fares airline.
It is even conceivable that the plans met with O'Leary's approval, as he confined his response to predictable 
criticism of the government and the Aer Lingus board for not accepting his second takeover offer late last year.
For weary shareholders who may otherwise have felt that Mueller's initiative was fine in theory, but unlikely to 
succeed in the real world of Aer Lingus's trauma-filled industrial relations environment, the fact that the airline's 
board was unanimously behind the proposals suggested this time may indeed be different.
The government, whose influence as a 25 per cent shareholder was a major factor in previous staff confrontations, 
is unlikely to be sufficiently motivated to protect the existing pay and conditions environment, given the backdrop of 
job losses and pay cuts across the wider economy.
Unions, meanwhile, m ay make their usual noises but will be conscious that strike action will do little more than 
damage the airline's already fragile financial position - as well as risk losing public support at a time when the 
general public take a dim view of any worker who appears ungrateful for having a job.
Mueller has also brought a new form of poker face to the table, bluntly warning staff that the cuts will run even 
deeper if they do not agree to implement his plans on schedule.
He has also thrown in an intriguing element into the mix by signalling that the airline will seek a licence to operate 
more services from Britain and Belfast.
Mueller is known to be a strong supporter of Mannion's decision to diversify by establishing more bases outside the 
Republic, and this move suggested he might be inclined to look more favourably on those parts of his empire that 
operate to industry norms.
Staff who fancy their chances of mounting a defiant stand against last week's proposals may yet fear that their new 
boss could retaliate down the line by aggressively switching capacity to his lower-cost bases in Belfast and London 
Gatwick, with a third base in Britain or perhaps on the continent expected to be opened within two years.
For many, it may be a case of choosing between a slow, painful death and a quick exit. But after years of worrying 
about the threat from the master of cost-cutting based across the car park from their headquarters, it's now time to 
worry about a kindred spirit that has installed himself much closer to home.

Airlines face rising pressure to cut costs

News analysis
Failure to put their plans in action will be problematic for BA and Aer Lingus, writes Pilita Clark
Body
When British Airways launched its new business class-only flight from London's City airport to New York last week, 
all on board knew the short London runway meant there would be a refuelling stop in Ireland about an hour after 
take-off.
But some passengers were surprised to hear that the captain and his co-pilot left the aircraft at Shannon, to be 
replaced by another crew, in keeping with the complex web of rules and agreements that govern how long pilots 
can fly.
One week on, and work practices at BA and fellow flag carrier Aer Lingusare under scrutiny after both announced 
another round of cost-cutting and unions threatened strike action.
As the aviation industry struggles with the economic downturn and high fuel prices, BA and Aer Lingus are under 
pressure to act. Aer Lingus reported a EUR120m pre-tax loss last year and has seen its cash balance shrink from 
almost EUR800m to close to EUR300m (£276m) in 18 months.
BA announced a £401m pre-tax loss last year and is on course for what it described this week as another 
"significant loss" this year - the first time in its history it will have suffered two consecutive years of losses.
BA says the pilot rotas on the London-Shannon-New York route are neither representative of broader working 
conditions at the airline, nor wasteful.
"The way we're doing it is the most cost efficient," a BA spokesman said yesterday.
Even so, BA, like many older, formerly state-controlled airlines, remains an enviable place to work.
Airlines face rising pressure to cut costs
A BA pilot is paid an average £107,600 according to the most recent Civil Aviation Authority figures, above the 
£89,500 paid by its trans-Atlantic rival, Virgin Atlantic, or the £71,400 at EasyJet.
Average salaries for BA's cabin attendants are £29,900, more than double those at Virgin, and well above EasyJet's 
£20,200.
On a number of international flights, BA also has up to two more crew than Virgin. It is a similar story at Aer Lingus. 
Pilots' compensation averages between EUR175,000 and EUR200,000 the company says, and pilots have a 
pension scheme in which they contribute 9 per cent to the airline's 21 per cent under a system that dates back to 
the 1950s.
Despite its flag carrier status, Aer Lingus derives more revenue from short-haul flights than longer ones, yet its 
labour costs as a percentage of revenue are about 25 per cent,   says research by Goldman Sachs.
That is not far from the 27 per cent average for flag carriers such as BA, and a distant cry from the 12 per cent 
average for low-cost carriers such as local rival Ryanair.
BA has been steadily cutting costs since it was privatised in 1987. But it argues that it is wrong to compare its 
business model with that of low-cost short-haul operators such as Ryanair.
This is one point on which Unite, the union representing BA's cabin crew, agrees with the airline.
"It is important to compare like with like," Unite said yesterday.
"BA is not competing with Ryanair. It is competing with Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Air France . . . other global 
carriers, not short-haul, low-cost operators which have an entirely different business model."
However, industry analysts such as Joe Gill, director of equity research at Bloxham stockbrokers in Dublin, say this 
is the sort of argument flag carriers were making 15 years ago as they defended short-haul business models - until 
the arrival of Ryanair.
Mr Gill, like many analysts, also has doubts about the ability of older carriers to boost revenues.
"Legacy carriers will struggle to raise unit revenues while EasyJet and Ryanair continue to grow volume and spread 
industry lowest fares into the market," he says.
That explains why BA and Aer Lingus are so keen to cut costs. The plans outlined by Christoph Mueller, Aer 
Lingus's new chief executive, are far more radical: 676 job cuts (17 per cent of the workforce) including pilots and 
cabin crew, wage cuts for those still left and an end to the generous pension scheme - all aimed at reducing annual 
operating costs by EUR97m by the end of 2011.
BA plans to cut the equivalent of 1,700 cabin crew jobs from 14,000, reduce the number of crew on some flights 
and bring in measures to reduce pay for future recruits.
Failure to put the plan into action would be problematic on many levels: BA's pilots agreed to pay cuts and other 
measures this year in separate negotiations that amount to savings of £26m year on year - but insist the deal is 
dependent on other groups such as cabin crew taking their share of pain as well.
For Aer Lingus, with the threat of Ryanair on its doorstep, failure to cut costs could have far more serious 
consequences.

One hundred and two cabin crew jobs are to go at Shannon as Aer Lingus dramatically slims its operation there.
The job cuts were announced to staff there last night by the airline's chief executive Christoph Mueller and other 
managers.
The slim down will reduce the number of cabin crew based at the airport by 75pc.
In addition, the company said 75 ground operation posts would face reduced hours at Shannon. Union sources 
there said last night that the changes would mean the end of transatlantic jets being based at the airport. They said 
that from the start of next year Shannon would become a stopover on routes from Dublin. They said that there were 
likely to be just four weekly flights to Boston and three to New York. The sources said that 34 remaining cabin crew 
would work on the three times a day Shannon - Heathrow service, which is the airline's only other remaining route 
out of the airport. After the meeting with staff, the Aer Lingus corporate affairs director Enda Corneille said that 70 
pc of the airline's 93m euro loss for the first six months of the year was on long-haul. He said none of its 
transatlantic routes were profitable. It was now a question, he said, of providing a future for Aer Lingus as a whole 
and not just Shannon. Overall the airline is seeking to slim its workforce by 676 and save 97m euro. Mr Corneille 
admitted that the proposed cutbacks had been "overwhelming" for staff. Management had also briefed staff in Cork 
before going to Shannon. Earlier, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary had called on the government to explain why it did 
not accept his airline's takeover offer for Aer Lingus. Speaking on RTE Radio, Mr O'Leary said that if the 
government had accepted Ryanair's offer, it would have doubled the size of Aer Lingus' fleet and create at least 
1,000 new jobs.

Tourism Ireland today announced an additional E1.5m marketing blitz in Great Britain over the coming weeks to 
help stimulate business now and into the early months of 2010.
The latest initiative is on top of an extensive autumn campaign which kicked off in late August.
According to Tourism Ireland, the period September-December traditionally yields as much as 30pc of overall 
tourism business.
The global tourism industry continues to be hit hard by the worldwide recession and the extreme volatility in major 
markets. Great Britain, our largest and most important market, has been no exception. Outbound travel from Britain 
to Western European destinations declined by -15.2pc between January and July this year. Travel to the island of 
Ireland has also been affected but has fared marginally better over the same period. Tourism Ireland is in the 
process of finalising a review of the British market, initiated earlier this year, and will launch a new marketing 
strategy and action plan in early December which will be rolled out in Britain next year. The new campaign will 
facilitate additional co-operative marketing activities to year end with industry partners including Dublin Tourism, Aer 
Lingus, Ryanair and Stena among others, putting the spotlight on our Culture, Festivals, Food and our People. 
'Better value than ever before' will be a central message across all marketing activities, showing what that will mean 
for the British visitor on the ground here. In addition, Tourism Ireland is setting up a programme of face-to-face 
meetings and platforms for island of Ireland-based tourism industry to re-engage directly with the British travel trade 
and travel intermediaries. A key part of this trade activity will focus on World Travel Market in November, which is 
one of the world's largest travel showcases, attended by industry from over 200 countries.

Lingus, Ryanair and Stena among others, putting the spotlight on our Culture, Festivals, Food and our People. 
'Better value than ever before' will be a central message across all marketing activities, showing what that will mean 
for the British visitor on the ground here. In addition, Tourism Ireland is setting up a programme of face-to-face 
meetings and platforms for island of Ireland-based tourism industry to re-engage directly with the British travel trade 
and travel intermediaries. A key part of this trade activity will focus on World Travel Market in November, which is 
one of the world's largest travel showcases, attended by industry from over 200 countries.

Meals on short-haul flights are gone and now 1,000 cabin crew will take voluntary redundancy, some 3,000 more 
will move to part-time work and unions claim salaries for recruits may halve. All as British Airways stares down the 
barrel of its second annual loss in a row, this one perhaps £300m to £400m. Net assets of £1.6bn in March stood at 
about half that of a year before. In spite of this, the 14,000-member BA cabin crew union has raised the spectre of 
strike action which, as the holiday season approaches, will cause pre-booking nerves amongst BA's potential 
customers. The union's response to cost cuts is puzzling, particularly given the poor productivity of Heathrow-based 
cabin crew.
Crew can legally accrue up to 900 flying hours per year; a work rate that discounters Ryanair and EasyJet regard 
as normal. BA's Heathrow staff, however, only work about 600 hours a year.
On transatlantic flights, a BA aircraft may fly with two more crew than rival Virgin Atlantic. Many short-haul flights 
only require three crew, but BA takes four or five. This could be justified under the old full-service model, but an end 
to frills renders extra crew unnecessary.
Furthermore, unlike those for Gatwick staff, rules for Heathrow crew make switching staff between short-haul and 
long-haul flights difficult. This obstacle can leave a short-haul plane understaffed, while long-haul crew idle in 
another.
BA's crew problems are deep-rooted. The carrier may have been privatised in 1987, but indexed and longevity-
based pay rises still haunt contracts. The union has previously made an offer to BA to save about £140m, but it 
should accept that the premium airline industry is listing heavily to starboard. It needs to do something more 
substantial to help.

Unions angry at Aer Lingus plan to cut fifth of workforce

Act dubbed 'extreme and draconian'
Body
Aer Lingus trade unions have reacted angrily to the airline's plan to cut a fifth of its workforce, in a EUR97m (£90m) 
cost-cutting programme to save Ireland's former state-owned carrier.
The company, which has been hit by falling fares and higher fuel bills, is launching a two-stage "transformational 
restructuring plan" - its latest bid to return to profit.
Aer Lingus shares, which have risen 15 per cent in the past week in anticipation of the announcement, firmed 9 
cents to 77 cents.
The plan involves 676 redundancies, including 489 among pilots, cabin crew and ground staff, and 187, or 40 per 
cent, of its backoffice staff. Christoph Mueller, chief executive, said: "We do not have enough work for all the people 
employed by Aer Lingus."
Salaries for those earning above EUR35,000 are to be cut by 10 per cent. The company, in which the Irish 
government retains a 25.4 per cent stake, is also looking for pension cost savings and new work practices.
Aer Lingus, which reported pre-tax losses of EUR119.7m in the year to December 31, said it "cannot survive in a 
situation where staff are paid more and operate less efficiently than in comparable positions at its peers".
The company, which has fended off two takeover bids from Ryanair since it was privatised in 2006, has embarked 
on a six-week consultation process with staff, but warned it would press on with compulsory redundancies if 
necessary.
Mr Mueller, who took over last month, said the company would listen to constructive alternative proposals, but it 
"cannot compromise on the savings level". Colm Barrington, chairman, said the plan had been unanimously agreed 
by the board, which includes David Begg, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.

But Gerry McCormack, national industrial secretary of the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, 
described the job loss proposal as "extreme and draconian and an over-reaction to the current economic climate".
Christina Carney, assistant general secretary of Impact, which represents cabin crew, said: "We cannot keep 
propping up this airline."

Irish airline Aer Lingus unveils survival plan

Body
Aer Lingus, the loss-making Irish airline, announced Wednesday it will lay off more than 15 percent of its staff, cut 
pay rates and expand operations in Britain to survive competition with its much bigger rival, Ryanair.
The plan was the opening salvo fired by Aer Lingus' new chief executive, Christoph Mueller, who since taking the 
reins in Dublin last month has declared that the formerly state-owned and union-friendly airline has only a 50-50 
chance of survival.
Labor unions warned they would resist Mueller's plans to cut 676 positions from the 3,900-strong work force and 
demand more from staff as part of his formula to trim &#8264;lion ($143 million) from annual operating costs by 
2011.
But investors liked the move and sent Aer Lingus' battered shares 7 percent higher to &#8264;n early trade.
In a statement, the Aer Lingus board of directors said the airline must "compete more effectively against a peer 
group with significantly lower operating costs" specifically Dublin-based Ryanair. It said trade unions faced a stark 
choice to accept tougher work conditions or risk the company's collapse.
"Aer Lingus cannot survive in a situation where staff are paid significantly more and operate less efficiently than 
comparable positions at its peers," the board said. "Aer Lingus must rationalize work practices in the air, on the 
ground and in support staff areas to introduce best practice processes and procedures, and at least match its 
competitors in terms of productivity. Aer Lingus' operational flexibility cannot continue to be held back by restrictive 
practices that date from the past."
Aer Lingus also said it must exploit its current license to operate hubs in the United Kingdom beyond its current 
bases in London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Belfast International Airport in neighboring Northern Ireland. 
It said the company must broaden its customer base from "the current dependency on the Irish consumer."
Christina Carney, assistant general secretary of the Impact trade union representing 1,100 Aer Lingus cabin crew, 
said they had already endured too many staff cuts and lost privileges.

"We've given enough. The company needs to respect what the cabin crew have already done and stop breaking 
agreements, which they consistently do," Carney said.

Body
Michael Cawley, Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer of Ryanair this morning said that, while Ireland 
is more expensive to operate in that many other countries the airline is not "a flight risk".
"Costs of regulated monopolies in Ireland have far exceeded those of their peers elsewhere in the EU. If Ryanair 
moved to certain other countries in the morning, we would immediately save on certain operating costs. Ryanair is 
not planning such a move but we are more than aware of the costs of staying in Ireland," he said.
Mr Cawley was speaking at the announcement of a UCD Business Schools conference that will see Ireland's top 
business leaders share the lessons of their international success.
Mr. Cawley said "For some Irish businesses, access to export markets is not only an option but an imperative. 
Ryanair, the largest airline in Europe, has developed from a situation where 100pc of its business was from Ireland 
and the UK in 1997 to a situation today where less than 40pc comes from the UK and Ireland, with the balance 
coming from across Europe and Morocco. Obviously Ryanair could not have grown as large as it did without 
moving outside the very limited market that Ireland offers. We have grown from 3 million passengers in 1997 to 66 
million passengers this year." Also speaking at the announcement of the UCD Business Schools seminar was 
Professor Patrick Gibbons, Jefferson Smurfit professor of corporate planning at UCD School of Business. He 
commented, "Ryanair's phenomenal growth has been achieved on the basis of international ambition, a keen 
insight on the requirements for success in European aviation and a relentless pursuit of cost efficiency as a basis 
for advantage." He added, "These factors of international ambition, insight into customer needs and focus on the 
firm's ongoing basis of advantage have never been as critical as they are now in the face of severe economic 
challenge. These factors also serve as key lessons for other Irish businesses that are looking to internationalise."

A surge in Aer Lingus and CRH stocks pushed the ISEQ index higher again today.
The index rose 15.01 points to 3,310.76.
Investors cheered the confirmation yesterday that Aer Lingus is to make 676 job cuts at the airline. In a statement to 
the markets, it said it needs to reduce annual costs by almost E100m before 2011.
The airline says 489 jobs will be cut from amongst its pilots, cabin crew and ground staff. It said it would hold a six 
week consultation period with staff and unions which is expected to be completed by November 18 but unions have 
already said they will fight. The airline added that a further 187 jobs will go in back office operations by the end of 
2011. Phase one will incorporate pay and staff number reductions in operational and support areas, including a 
major revamp of operational work practices and a reduced flight schedule. This will result in 489 surplus positions. 
While many may be achieved voluntarily, the group will consider compulsory redundancy. Staff savings are 
anticipated at E74m by 2011, with around 80pc of that run rate in 2010. Non staff costs are anticipated to fall 
another E23m. Elsewhere, AL proposes to transition its pension arrangements and is in discussion with trustees, 
but aspires to result in no increase in the net cost to the company. Phase 2 will involve some IT infrastructure work, 
which will deliver further cost saves and revenue enhancement, with particular focus on head office support 
functions, which will see a further 187 redundancies (so, 676 in total). Shares in the airline rose by 7pc or 6c to 
E0.77. Shares in rival and major shareholder, Ryanair, edged up 2c to E3.49. CRH shares jumped 36c to E19.07 
amid growing hopes that the US will emerge from the downturn before the New Year and that the Eurozone will 
ease out of recession early in 2010. Bank stocks were mostly lower with AIB down 7c to E3.01, Bank of Ireland 
declined by 10c to E3.07 while Irish Life and Permanent climbed 8c to E5.67. Shares in United Drug fell by 2c to

A surge in Aer Lingus and CRH stocks pushed the ISEQ index higher again today.
The index rose 15.01 points to 3,310.76.
Investors cheered the confirmation yesterday that Aer Lingus is to make 676 job cuts at the airline. In a statement to 
the markets, it said it needs to reduce annual costs by almost E100m before 2011.
The airline says 489 jobs will be cut from amongst its pilots, cabin crew and ground staff. It said it would hold a six 
week consultation period with staff and unions which is expected to be completed by November 18 but unions have 
already said they will fight. The airline added that a further 187 jobs will go in back office operations by the end of 
2011. Phase one will incorporate pay and staff number reductions in operational and support areas, including a 
major revamp of operational work practices and a reduced flight schedule. This will result in 489 surplus positions.

which will deliver further cost saves and revenue enhancement, with particular focus on head office support 
functions, which will see a further 187 redundancies (so, 676 in total). Shares in the airline rose by 7pc or 6c to 
E0.77. Shares in rival and major shareholder, Ryanair, edged up 2c to E3.49. CRH shares jumped 36c to E19.07 
amid growing hopes that the US will emerge from the downturn before the New Year and that the Eurozone will 
ease out of recession early in 2010. Bank stocks were mostly lower with AIB down 7c to E3.01, Bank of Ireland 
declined by 10c to E3.07 while Irish Life and Permanent climbed 8c to E5.67. Shares in United Drug fell by 2c to

EasyJet shares rise after increase in passenger numbers
EasyJet shares rise after increase in passenger numbers

Shares in EasyJet moved higher yesterday after the UK's leading low-cost airline said passenger numbers rose at 
the fastest pace in five months in September.
In another sign of the relative strength of short-haul, low-cost carriers over long-haul flag carriers in the downturn, 
EasyJet said it had just more than 4.4m passengers last month, an increase of 5.3 per cent over the same month 
last year.
The increase, the biggest since April, was well above the 4.7 per cent rise the airline recorded in August, 
traditionally one of its busiest months.
The carrier's load factor, a measurement of how well it fills its seats, also rose slightly to 88.1 per cent.
Analysts said passenger and load numbers were slightly ahead of expectations and EasyJet's shares, which rose 
more than 4 per cent during the day, closed up 1.7 per cent at 385p.
The figures came a day after Ryanair reported its September passenger numbers had risen 17 per cent compared 
with the same month last year, while its load factor increased one percentage point to 85 per cent.
In contrast, British Airways said the number of passengers it carried fell 1.7 per cent over the same period, while 
traffic measured by revenue passenger kilometres dipped 0.8 per cent.
The first and business class passengers on which BA depends heavily for revenue were down 7.9 per cent.
EasyJet said part of the reason for the increase in its passenger numbers was that it had been able to attract more 
cost-conscious business class travellers from airlines such as British AirwaysBA.
In addition, EasyJet said the airline had benefited from growing numbers of leisure travellers who had decided to 
take short-haul trips closer to home over summer rather than a longer journey from, say Europe to the US.
EasyJet shares rise after increase in passenger numbers
The airline has worked on improving its network strategy, which has seen it concentrate on main airports, putting it 
into more direct competition with larger flag carriers.
"We are now present in 40 out of the 50 largest airports in Europe," the company said.
The global aviation industry is facing what it says is the worst downturn in its history.
The International Air Transport Association, which represents the world's leading airlines, reported last month that 
the global airline industry faces $11bn of losses this year, which is $2bn more than was previously forecast.

Ryanair has moved to scotch talk that it is planning to take control of Aer Lingus by contributing to its balance sheet.
Speculation that it plans to do this has grown since chief executive Michael O'Leary's recent agm statement that his 
company would be prepared to invest more money in the former state carrier.
The speculation, which has now surfaced in the Financial Times, has been linked to the repeated prediction of 
O'Leary that Aer Lingus will run out of money within a couple of years.
In a stock market statement, the low cost carrier has now moved to kill off the talk. It says O'Leary has "confirmed 
that there was 'no substance' to reports which appeared on FT.com claiming that Ryanair could take control to Aer 
Lingus through a rights issue". It adds: "Our position on Aer Lingus was recently confirmed at the Ryanair agm, 
which is that we are 'highly unlikely' to make a third offer. "Aer Lingus would now be profitable, growing and creating 
new jobs if the Irish government had accepted either of Ryanair's two previous offers instead of which sadly Aer 
Lingus is suffering record losses and will shortly announce a huge redundancy programme as it continues to be 
mismanaged and controlled by its government and trade union appointed board."

Irish shares made substantial new gains today as the local market followed a global trend higher.
Buyers pushed the ISEQ index 62.72 points higher on the day to 3,295.75.
A positive global mood had flowed from news this morning of a hike in Australian interest rates, as the central bank 
there began easing back on its stimulus of the economy.
Australia is the first industrialised country to make such a move, and the initiative was seen around the world as a 
milestone in the global recovery. The positive mood continued into the European session, and on into US trading 
this evening. Gains were general across the board in Dublin, with banks among the biggest winners. AIB rose by 7c 
to 308, and Bank of Ireland gained 22c to 317. Shares in the food group Greencore were greatly cheered by results 
from one of its competitors Northern Foods. The two companies are in roughly the same business, and both 
operate mainly in the UK. So a cheery assurance from it yesterday that its business is doing well proved a boost for 
the Irish firm. Davy Stockbrokers' analyst Liam Igoe pointed out that the upbeat message from Northern comes 
after last week's treading statement from Marks and Spencer about the robust state of the UK food market. 
Greencore advanced by 8c to 1549. The Northern statement also helped Kerry Group, another Irish food operation 
with extensive exposure to the UK.British operations. Its shares rose 20c to 1940. Shares in another Irish food 
group Glanbia did less well, falling by 1c to 285, reflecting its heavy involvement in the currently distressed dairy 
sector. A meeting of EU agriculture ministers held this week to dsicuss the sector's problems came up with little or 
nothing other than the old dictum, live horse and get grass. All that came out of the meeting was a promise by EU 
farm commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel to launch an "expert group" next week to see what if anything can be 
done. Ryanair was in flying form, gaining 12c to 350, after traffic statistics this week showing a 17pc rise in 
passenger numbers for September. Analysts are currently in upbeat mood about the low cost carrier. Bloxham 
Stockbrokers said in a note yesterday that it has been cutting back on capacity, which should help keep average 
seat prices up. The broker added that the airline was continuing to cut costs and that non-fuel bills were likely to be

CRH earns around half its profits in the US and is particularly involved in the highway sector. Analyst Robert Eason

CRH earns around half its profits in the US and is particularly involved in the highway sector. Analyst Robert Eason

United States, and that every USD 1 bn lifts CRH's profits by 1.5c a share.

Ryanair today wrote to Aer Lingus Chairman, Colm Barrington, to request a full list of all those who are entitled to 
free flights on Aer Lingus. Ryanair says it believes that these free-flight deals for former directors and others are 
inappropriate and unjustifiable at a time when Aer Lingus is losing over E100m per year and considering severe 
cuts.
Ryanair has asked Mr Barrington to confirm what other categories/groups/persons are entitled to free flights on Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair has called on Aer Lingus to publish the details of those categories or groups of non-employees who 
have an entitlement to free flights on Aer Lingus and to explain why this entitlement exists. Ryanair is calling on the 
Board of Aer Lingus to immediately end these free-flight schemes, which it says are an unjustified cost and waste at 
a time when Aer Lingus is losing money and considering substantial job cuts.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "It is entirely wrong for Aer Lingus to be giving free flights entitlements to former 
Board Directors, including political appointees and possibly others at a time when the airline is losing money, is 
considering widespread job and pay cuts and is running down its cash balances at an alarming rate.
"Ryanair, like all other Aer Lingus shareholders, is concerned to ensure that the Board of Aer Lingus tackles its 
bloated cost base, and eliminates unnecessary cost and waste, such as free flights for non-employees such as Mr 
Fitzpatrick and any other political appointees to the Board of Aer Lingus."

Body
Aer Lingus is expected to brief workers on Wednesday about proposed measures to cut costs and reverse 
mounting losses, the IMPACT trade union said today.
The airline, which has fended off two hostile bids from Ryanair Holdings Plc, said in August it would cut wages and 
probably jobs, but a detailed plan had to await the arrival last month of Chief Executive Christoph Mueller.
"There is a series of workshops taking place (tomorrow) that the company are hosting," said a spokesman for 
IMPACT, which represents hundreds of Aer Lingus cabin crew and pilots. "This is apparently when they will present 
their cost-cutting proposals."
A spokesman for Aer Lingus said some internal briefings were scheduled for Wednesday, adding he "could not 
confirm that any announcement was due" and would not elaborate. The IMPACT spokesman said Aer Lingus had 
not yet informed the union about the content of the restructuring proposals. SIPTU, which represents mainly ground 
crew, said it would wait until Aer Lingus' announcement before making a comment. Aer Lingus has been fast 
burning through its cash reserves due to a combination of declining sales -- especially on long-haul routes -- and 
high labour costs, a legacy of its history as a state-owned company. A source close to the company, whose rival 
Ryanair has one of the lowest cost bases in the industry worldwide, said in August the planned savings could affect 
10 percent of its cost base. The Irish Times reported last week the board had agreed on a cost-cutting programme 
which could involve close to 500 of about 3,900 staff leaving the company and remaining employees taking a 10 
percent pay cut in a bid to save 130 million euros. (c ) Reuters

EasyJet Reports Higher Load Factor, Passenger Numbers For September - Update

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet PLC (EZJ.L) on Tuesday reported increases in load factor and number of 
passengers for the month of September 2009.
Load factor, or the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for passengers, for the 
month rose 1.2 percentage points to 88.1% from 86.9% in the prior-year month. The company noted that no 
weighting of the load factor is carried out to recognize the effect of varying flight or stage lengths.
The company&apos;s passengers in September increased 5.3% to 4.4 million from 4.2 million reported in 
September of the previous year.
easyJet noted that passenger statistics represent the number of earned seats flown, which include seats flown 
whether the passenger turns up or not and seats provided for promotional purposes and to staff for business travel.
Since easyJet is a no-refund airline, once a flight has departed, a no-show customer is generally not entitled to 
change flights or seek a refund.
Last month, easyJet said its August load factor increased by 0.5% year-over-year to 91.8% from 91.3%, while the 
number of passengers increased by 4.7% to 4.80 million passengers from 4.59 million passengers for the same 
period last year.
For the rolling 12-month-period ended September 2009, passengers grew 3.4% to 45.16 million from 43.67 million. 
Load factor for the rolling 12 months rose 1.4 percentage points to 85.5% from 84.1% in the previous year.
easyJet said last month that it plans to close its East Midlands base and reduce Luton flying program by up to 20%. 
The company plans to re-deploy its East Midlands and Luton aircraft in profitable bases, largely in continental 
Europe.
Although the economic crisis has reduced travel, budget airliners have managed to stay afloat as more and more 
people are trying to reduce expenses. Monday, Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) said its September 
passengers traffic increased 17% to 6.12 million from 5.23 million in the year-ago period. The Irish airline&apos;s 
load factor for the month rose to 85% from 84% in the prior year period.
EasyJet Reports Higher Load Factor, Passenger Numbers For September - Update
The International Air Transport Association, or IATA, issued a revised global financial forecast last month, which 
sees deeper than the previously projected losses in 2009 owing to rising fuel costs and falling yields. Passenger 
traffic is now expected to decline by 4.0% and cargo by 14% for 2009, compared to its earlier forecasts for declines 
of 8.0% and 17%, respectively. Yields are expected to fall 12% for passenger and 15% for cargo, in comparison 
with its June forecasts of declines of 7% and 11%, respectively.
British Airways plc (BAY, BAY.L, BAIRY.PK), which relies heavily on transatlantic premium traffic, on Monday 
reported a 0.8% decline in traffic for September to 9.83 billion from 9.91 billion in the same period last year. Total 
passengers carried during the month were 2.92 million, down 1.7% from 2.97 million in the year ago period. The 
airline noted that market conditions in September remained unchanged, with yields under pressure from the year-
over-year impact of lower fuel surcharges, exchange movements and mix. The airline&apos;s cargo fell by 2.6%.
EZJ.L closed Monday&apos;s regular trade at 378.90 pence, up 8.70 pence or 2.35%, on 816,179 shares.

BA hit again by decline in business and first class traffic
BA hit again by decline in business and first class traffic

Body
The number of passengers flying with British Airways has fallen again, dashing hopes of a recovery from what 
airlines say is the worst downturn to hit the aviation industry.
First and business class passenger traffic, on which BA depends heavily, tumbled 7.9 per cent this September 
compared with last year, the month that saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US.
The number of nonpremium passengers rose slightly, by 0.7 per cent, but overall passenger traffic fell 0.8 per cent.
The declines were less severe than those seen in previous months: premium traffic fell 11 per cent year-on-year in 
July, and 11.9 per cent in August.
Analysts said the figures were largely within expectations. Andrew Lobbenberg, airline analyst at Royal Bank of 
Scotland, said: "The situation is not getting worse and pressure on business travel may be moderating, though only 
slightly."
BA reported that its passenger load factor, a measurement of how well it fills its aircraft, had risen by 2.4 points 
against September last year, to 81.3 per cent, as it cut capacity.
Cargo, which has also been hit by the global downturn, fell 2.6 per cent.
Shares in BA, which were already up before the monthly passenger figures were announced, closed 6.7p higher at 
217p.
In a sign of how international long-haul airlines such as BA are faring in the downturn compared with low-cost 
carriers, Ryanair yesterday reported it carried 6.12m passengers in September, 17 per cent more than a year ago.
It also said its average flight was slightly fuller than last September, as its load factor increased one percentage 
point to 85 per cent.
BA hit again by decline in business and first class traffic
The International Air Transport Association, which represents the world's leading airlines, last month reported that 
the global airline industry faces $11bn (£6.9bn) of losses this year, which is $2bn more than was previously 
forecast.
The trade body also expects airlines to lose $3.8bn globally next year, as their premium business customers either 
buy cheaper tickets or stop flying altogether.

Initially the market got a lift from the weekend's big "yes" to the Lisbon Treaty, with analysts pointing to investor 
relief that the economy will be spared the uncertainty that a "no" vote would have brought.
A boost was certainly needed, since the latest purchasing managers' index for Ireland, also out today, showed 
shrinkage in the services sector worsening in September.
The drop in the index was bad news for the economy, suggesting that recent hopes that things are bottoming out 
may be premature. Initially it looked good, with shares making modest to good gains early on. But as the day 
continued, the rises fell back. The ISEQ index of Irish shares ended its session just 2.1 points ahead at 3,233.03. 
The reassuring effect of the Lisbon vote on international lending to Ireland gave some support to the banks through 
to the close. AIB ended 3c higher at 301 and Irish Life and Permanent added 14c to 544. Bank of Ireland slipped by 
2c, however, to 305. The banks would possibly have done better, had it not been for a report from JP Morgan, 
which estimated that AIB needs an injection of USD 10 billion of capital, the second largest amount of any 
European bank. And Bank of Ireland needs USD 7 billion, the third largest sum in the sector. Other big names on 
the rise today were packaging group Smurfit Kappa, up 8c to 545, building materials giant CRH ahead by 27c to 
1841, and healthcare support group United Drug gaining 3c to 230. Ryanair gained 4c to 343, as the market 
absorbed a raft of new information passed on by the low cost carrier at an investors' day last Friday. Among the 
nuggets was, as analyst Eamonn Hughes of Goodbody Stockbrokers pointed out, that it is growing increasingly 
unlikely that Ryanair will be able to talk Boeing down to the kind of price level it wants on new planes to allow it to 
keep growing rapidly. If it can't get the price it wants, it is planning to cut its growth back and run the company for 
maximum profit. Independent News and Media shares failed to react to news that committee of bondholders formed 
to deal with the company has rejected a plan by Denis O'Brien to buy them off. According to Gerry Hennigan of 
Goodbodys, it involved payment of 50m euro to both them and creditor banks in return for a 51.3pc stake. 
ISEQ ends just 2.21 points up at 3233.03; ISEQ Flat
Independent shares closed unchanged at 20c. Shares in the drinks company C and C were ahead by 8c to 294 , a 
price that Davy analyst Barry Gallagher said in a note contained a discount. He saw " strong earnings growth 
potential" for the group and "good cash flow generation" which he saw as a pointer towards a higher price. Paddy 
Power shares closed 10c lower at 2085. Goodbody's Killian Murphy noted a worrying number of draws in the 
English Premier League so far this year. He warned that this tends to put punters off accumulator bets which tend 
to be for wins. It is something, he said, that may force bookmakers to revise their profit guidance downwards.

Ryanair flew 6.12 million passengers in September, an increase of 17pc on the same month last year. This brings 
to 63.3 million the amount of passengers flown by the budget airline in the 12 months ending on September 30. In 
addition, the airline's load factor (the number of passengers as a proportion of the number of seats available for 
passengers) stood at 85pc, which is a 1pc increase over September 2008.
Commenting on the numbers, Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair carried three times British Airways UK/ 
Europe passengers, and more than double the total number of British Airways passengers in September as millions 
of passengers continue to switch from high fares, frequently delayed airlines to Ryanair's low fares, on-time flights.

Body
You know something strange is afoot when Michael O'Leary spends EUR500,000 of shareholder money 
campaigning for Brussels-based bureaucrats whom Ryanair's penny-pinching chief executive more usually calls 
"idiots". Ireland's second referendum on Europe's Lisbon treaty has become an emotional affair. But for investors 
the implications lie elsewhere.
Polls suggest a Yes result is likely, although not assured. It is a toss up between anger and fear. Anger over bank 
bail-outs, corruption and the recession could provoke a protest No targeted at an unpopular government; but fears 
that a No might destabilise the economy and turn Dublin into Reykjavik-on-Liffey push the other way.
The No campaigners have convinced few that Lisbon would mean lower minimum wages, legalised abortion and 
military conscription. Meanwhile, the biggest problem for pro-Lisbon campaigners is that there is no simple reason 
for voting Yes based on the treaty. One trump card - that it would assure Ireland a permanent European Union 
commissioner - is likely to happen regardless of Lisbon's fate. Another slogan (that Yes is a vote for recovery) is 
also unconvincing.
After all, government bond spreads were unmoved by June's No. Nor would a Yes vote now make it any easier for 
Ireland to cut its budget deficit or stop government debt rising. It would not boost competitiveness; only a fall in 
wages, up 20 per cent more than the euro average since 2000, can do that. Nor would it help Ireland's arguably 
biggest economic problem: the currency, whose strength now stifles exports.
What an Irish No vote would do is kill the Lisbon treaty. That would mean the end of further EU enlargement; Berlin 
and Paris have been clear about that. Iceland and Croatia might still join, but the accession of Turkey, Ukraine and 
Balkan states becomes unlikely. For investors, therefore, the outcome of today's vote is of little importance for 
Ireland but crucial for countries hundreds of miles away.

Polish airline faces union unrest over cost cuts
Polish airline faces union unrest over cost cuts

Profits at Lot hit by fuel hedging
Body
Cost-cutting by the new management of Poland's troubled Lot airline has prompted the unions to protest outside its 
headquarters over the axeing of a generous collective bargaining agreement.
Sebastian Mikosz, who took over Lot in March, has been trying to turn it round before a possible privatisation.
The carrier reported a loss of 733m zlotys (m$262) last year, more than half of which came from ill-timed fuel price 
hedges. In the first quarter of this year it had a loss of 310m zlotys, but in the next three months Lot made 132m 
zlotys.
Passenger numbers have been hard hit by the economic crisis. Last year, Lot carried almost 4m passengers, but in 
the first six months of this year it carried only 1.7m.
"Lot's situation is no different from what is happening in the wider market, which is undergoing the biggest crisis 
since the second world war," Mr Mikosz said. But unlike larger carriers, Lot may not have the resources to ride out 
the crisis on its own.
Since taking over the airline, which is 93 per cent owned by the state treasury, Mr Mikosz has shut Lot's lossmaking 
low-cost subsidiary, Central Wings, slashed revenue-losing routes, and revoked a collective bargaining agreement 
which gave unionised workers generous protections and compensation.
"I have to restructure the airline at the cost of employment," said Mr Mikosz. "We are trying to rescue the jobs of the 
people who are left."
The cuts, including firing two union leaders, are causing labour unrest. The treasury ministry plans to meet 
management and unions next week to see if the two sides can be reconciled.
Polish airline faces union unrest over cost cuts
Simply cutting costs is not enough. Mr Mikosz, the seventh chief executive to lead the airline in the past four years, 
also has to decide whether an airline the size of Lot has a future as an independent carrier, or will have to be 
incorporated into a larger alliance.
Lufthansa, Lot's partner in the 24-member Star alliance, has long been seen as the likeliest candidate to take over 
the Polish airline. However, Lufthansa is in the process of acquiring Austrian and BMI British Midland.
Although Lot is Poland's leading airline, it is being harried by low-cost carriers, such as Ryanair, which has declared 
it wants to be Poland's largest airline by 2011.
Lot does fly some long-distance point-to-point routes to North America, but much of its flights consist of shuttling 
Polish passengers to Lufthansa's hubs in Frankfurt and Munich.
The airline has chosen Morgan Stanley to act as its adviser on the privatisation.

The fall of GPA day by day
The fall of GPA day by day
AirFinance Journal
October 2009
Copyright 2009 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved
Length: 1260 words
Highlight: A much delayed first book about GPA stirs up memories of working there, but as a diary of the tough 
times, fails to highlight the fun that many employees had at the company, writes Alasdair Whyte.
Body
GPA's failed initial public offering (IPO) in 1992 is still arguably the most significant event to have hit the aviation 
finance market. Without GPA there would be no Ryanair, no Gecas, no AerCap, no Pembroke, or Shannon Engine 
Support. Ireland would not be a key aviation finance location.
But despite its significance to aviation and Ireland - and the hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles written at 
the time - Christopher Brown's Crash Landing - An Inside Account of the Fall of GPA is the first book published 
about the company. While it is not fresh, it is still a fascinating story and an enjoyable read.
Crash Landing briefly covers the launch of GPA in 1970 but is mainly Brown's diary from April 1990 to April 1996.As 
well as covering the fall of the lessor, it also discusses individual airline clients and the problems GPA had placing 
new aircraft.
Brown's diary starts with him outlining his worries about GPA.He believes the lessor has over-ordered aircraft and 
that many of them are the wrong type. The aviation market is clearly entering the down cycle - and this is before the 
first Gulf war - and the company has too much debt. The rest of the book proves this thesis.
He outlines various restructuring initiatives, the failed IPO and the acquisition of much of the company by GE. It 
ends when he is made redundant by Gecas.
Although he was based in the UK most of the time - and like all GPA employees spent a lot of time flying - the diary 
shows that Brown spent a lot of time picking up as much information as possible from colleagues all over the world. 
In some ways it is a shame that he did not work in GPA Capital, where much of the action happened, but his stories 
about marketing aircraft and chasing debts are enjoyable.
While reading it is a bit like watching Titanic- you know how it is going to end - Crash Landing is an engrossing read 
for people who did not work at GPA. In fact, it is required reading for people who have to negotiate with former GPA 
staff, because it gives clues as to why they were such a tight-knit group. 
Why now?
The fall of GPA day by day
The biggest question is why has it taken so long for the book to be published. At least five books have already been 
published about Lehman Brothers in the 12 months since it collapsed; yet it has taken 13 years for Brown to open 
his diaries.
He says he did not want to publish too close to the event in case he damaged careers, and that emotions were so 
high after the IPO.
Cynics have assumed that he was worried that Tony Ryan, GPA's founder and chairman, who died in October 
2007,aged 71,might sue for libel. Brown denies this, saying he started re-editing the book in 2006 before becoming 
ill, which delayed publication.
He says he was reminded of his diaries when he read a newspaper article explaining how to get a book published 
by Gill &#38; Macmillan, Ireland's largest publisher, and he decided to contact the company. One of his life's 
ambitions had been to publish a book and he is now working on a novel.
Another reason for the delay may be that, at 64, he is no longer looking for new roles in aircraft leasing.
Brown says the diaries were barely edited, with the major change being the removal of names to make it more 
readable to people who did not work at GPA. This adds to the fun, as people who did work there can identify others.
Kieran Corr, now chief operating officer of Standard Chartered's Pembroke Capital, is referred to as "Our key 
numbers man on the trading floor", for example.
Brown says he was inspired to catalogue his time at GPA after regretting not writing an account of the failure of 
Laker Airways. He says he would write the diary in longhand and then type it up at home.
Reading by index
GPA employed more than 300 people and many of them have been checking the index first to see how they are 
mentioned before reading through it. While Patrick Blaney, who led the turn-around of GPA and negotiated the sale 
with GE, comes across as the hero of the book, some people - particularly Brown's managers and Ryan - are 
severely criticized.
"I would hate to think that would leave a nasty taste in anybody's mouth," says Brown. "I was pretty angry at the 
time, but the book was not meant to upset anyone."
A number of former colleagues say they are disappointed by his account, which fails to capture the enjoyment that 
many had. "It was a tough place to work but it was also a lot of fun," says one manufacturer.
This may partly reflect the fact that, although Brown had many friends at GPA, and former colleagues speak of him 
warmly, he was an outsider.
Brown had a very different background from many at GPA. He was older, having joined the lessor after working at 
Laker Airways and then advising Britannia Airways on aircraft leases. He started as a marketing vice-president in 
London, before moving to Shannon for just two years. Brown then moved back to Cambridge, England, but would 
fly to Shannon for the Monday sales meeting.
Brown joined GPA to make money. Ryan believed in rewarding employees and if the IPO had been successful it 
would have created many millionaires. GPA offered 40-year-old Englishman Brown a chance to make far more 
money than working for an airline when he joined in 1985.
Many of the people most annoyed by his account got on board earlier and stayed in Shannon. Ireland in the early 
1980s was nothing like the Celtic Tiger it later became. GPA employed many of the brightest graduates from Irish 
universities and there were few other Irish employers offering such an exciting international job.
"We used to say it was GPA or the Milk Board," says one Irish banker.
The fall of GPA day by day
GPA - and Ryan - gave them exciting work, a large amount of freedom and good pay. They had to work very hard 
and many also lost considerable amounts of money by taking out loans to buy shares, but they still stayed loyal to 
Ryan because of the opportunities he had given them. The failed IPO and restructuring also brought many of them 
together.
Brown says he was a very loyal employee who loved the company. However, he started the diary when he became 
worried about GPA's future and found the mistakes the company made extremely frustrating. At one point in his 
diary he is shocked that Ryan - whom he blames for the failure of the company - is given a standing ovation at a 
Gecas dinner.
He felt locked in by his share options, and while he says Ryan was a unique character, he still cannot understand 
why everyone is quite so proud of a failed company. 
Cold porridge
Although the book has upset people, it is good that it has been published. As Brown rightly argues: "History 
demands that someone published an account of GPA, as it was such a significant event." It is just a shame the 
book was not brought out earlier.
Along with ILFC,GPA created an industry that is responsible for financing over 30% of all new aircraft, worth more 
than $20 billion each year.
However, while Crash Landing is an enjoyable read, it is not a definitive history. The challenge is for another former 
GPA employee to write a book that captures the challenges, excitement, camaraderie and fun that existed when 
GPA was being built and, of course, the heartache that happened when the IPO failed. Brown after all, only started 
the diary when he became scared.
One senior Irish lessor, who used to work at GPA, doubts that any other diaries will surface. As he recalls: "Most of 
us were working too hard and drinking too hard to keep diaries."

Getting to Plan B
Breaking Through to a Better Business Model By John Mullins and Randy Komisar Harvard Business Press, 
$29.95/ £19.99
Body
Here is bad news and good news for budding entrepreneurs who spend years trying to get their initial master plan 
to work. The bad news is that not only do most plan As fail, but most great companies have achieved their success 
by moving quickly from plan A to plan B, C, D or E.
The point is made by John Mullins and Randy Komisar in Getting to Plan B.  Mullins, an associate professor of 
management practice at London Business School, had analysed what happened to participants in the LBS 
entrepreneurship summer school he had been running for five years. One finding was that 60 per cent of the new 
businesses still operating were no longer based on the ideas that the owner-managers first contemplated.
"These entrepreneurs are among the lucky few," says Mullins, who wrote The New Business Road Test  (2003) to 
help people assess ideas for start-ups.His analysis fits with general research that suggests it takes 58 new product 
ideas to deliver just one success.
Komisar, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm, and author at the height of the 
dotcom boom of The Monk and The Riddle , a popular book about entrepreneurship with a philosophical twist, 
writes from the investor's point of view. He relates how early last year, he and fellow partners gathered together the 
heads of several early-stage companies that Kleiner had backed. Two-thirds admitted they had abandoned the 
original idea they hadtaken Kleiner's money to develop.
Like Mullins, Komisar brings an intimate understanding of businesses that have to change the blueprint. In the 
1980s, as a lawyer, he represented many of the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who had started their companies in 
their garages. He joined Apple, where he was responsible for licensing and technology acquisitions but left to form 
Claris, which Apple later bought.
Why start-ups must plan to change plans
The good news is that Komisar and Mullins say their book can greatly improve the chances of start-ups emulating 
the success of globally successful businesses that have ventured far from their original strategy, such as Apple, 
payment system PayPal, fashion retailer Zara, no-frills airline Ryanair or internet call business Skype. Apple's 
creation of the iTunes music store and the iPod moved the PC maker into completely new territory. However, it 
used or adapted bits of other business models to make it work. For instance, it took Gillette's idea of selling cut-
price razors in order to make the money on replacement blades and turned it on its head, selling music at a mere 
99 cents so consumers would pay for pricey iPods.
The original plan of PayPal's Max Levchin, to develop security software for the Palm Pilot handheld device, proved 
hopeless. His second idea, for cryptography software, also bit the dust. It was only with Plan F, which involved 
enabling users to move cash securely from one Palm Pilot to another, that he got near a decent business idea. 
Even then the business model was not quite right.
Levchin's breakthrough was pure accident. Having built a web-based demonstration version of the software, he 
found people preferred to use this to move money rather than something on a handheld device. Fortunately, he 
swallowed his pride and focused on the website version to create what would eventually become PayPal, now the 
dominant system for paying securely for online purchases.
The model outlined by Mullins and Komisar has five key elements - much of which, it has to be said, comprise some 
fairly basic home truths. Their best advice is probably for founders to record systematically the leaps of faith they 
make and the hypotheses that grow out of those in a process they call dashboarding. Scientists do this in their 
sleep, they say, but it is a discipline that those caught up in the cut and thrust of building a business often fail to 
follow. This is likely to be the greatest help for entrepreneurs who need to get from plan A to plan B following the 
principle that what gets measured gets done.
If the advice at times seems a bit obvious, their achievement is to lay it out in an easily understood and digestible 
format. In this way, it is both a handbook for those already on the way to building a successful business as well as 
encouraging others to think they could do it.
If that was their plan, they have achieved it first time round.

Body
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary has said he wants to tie up an order with either Boeing or Airbus for 200 aircraft by 
the end of the year, reports Reuters.
O'Leary told reporters at a press conference that he wanted the aircraft to deliver in 2012, which is when the Irish 
budget carrier's present stream of deliveries end.
His comments came on the back of a television documentary broadcast in the UK which raised questions over 
Ryanair's supposedly hidden charges and potentially misleading information on its website.
Ryanair's fleet consists solely of Boeing aircraft, but O'Leary said the budget carrier will order Airbus aircraft if the 
manufacturer offers more competitive pricing.
In response to the Panorama documentary, he said that none of his airline's charges were hidden or misleading.

with ClickAir.
Body
Vueling had a (EURO)68.1 million ($100.9 million) operating profit during the third quarter, with its operating margin 
up by 10.2% compared with the same period last year. The airline also saw its revenue increase by 68.8% to 
(EURO)259.2 million since the same period in 2008. Its revenue per available seat kilometers declined by 1.3%, 
which the company attributed to higher fuel surcharges.
&
The Spanish carrier completed its merger with ClickAir during the last quarter. The financial results are the first after 
the completion of the merger between the two airlines. Vueling is Spain's fourth largest airline after Ryanair, Iberia 
and easyJet.
&
The airline does not expect demand to change dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2009. In fact, even despite fuel 
surcharges, the airline expects that cost and revenue synergies allocated for the first year of the merger will be 
almost 100% realized in the last quarter of 2009, and continue to positively impact its 2010 results.
&
Vueling says that in 2010 the airline&will strive to solidify its position at current operating bases and reduce its ex-
fuel cost base to below (EURO).04 for the year.

Three Ryanair directors received almost double the level of dissenting votes usually seen in director elections for 
the Irish Stock Exchange's top companies.
Proxy voting company Manifest, which advises institutional shareholders on corporate governance issues, has 
already dubbed the airline ''one of Europe's most shareholder unfriendly companies''.
Manifest said that the voting result of Ryanair's agm last week showed that Kyran McLaughlin, Michael Horgan and 
Paolo Pietrogrande received between 9 per cent and 10.1 per cent dissenting or abstaining votes.
According to Manifest's review of the 2008-09 voting season, directors standing for election at companies in the 
ISEQ 20 received average dissenting votes (against votes or abstentions) of 5.2 per cent.
Manifest's pre-agm research report to clients noted that McLaughlin was deputy chairman of Davy Stockbrokers, 
one of the group's stockbrokers.
It said that Horgan received consultancy fees, while each of the non-executive directors held outstanding options 
over shares in the company.
''Voting is a matter for shareholders," a spokeswoman for Ryanair said.
Manifest recently wrote to the Irish Stock Exchange expressing concerns about Ryanair's approach, asking it to 
consider an investigation into possible breaches of the listing rules in past annual reports.
Manifest said that rules required quoted companies to provide their shareholders with a detailed breakdown of 
voting results. Ryanair provided this information after this year's agm.

Euro federalists bully us and buy our vote

Body
The run-in to the Lisbon II vote on Friday, which should have been an example of a 2009 modern European 
democratic exercise at work, has become a depressing and shabby experience.
If anything, it has only heightened concerns about any prospect of a visible and accountable European political 
entity emerging at the end of it all.
These have been terrible days for Irish democracy.
From the outset, the Euro federalists were outraged that little Ireland had dared to reject Lisbon.
This time, they were determined to roll out their big guns. Having conspired to slip the treaty through the various 
national parliaments after the democratic rebuff they received on the European Constitution, they were astonished 
that the Irish had used the people's sovereignty, guaranteed in the Irish Constitution, to say No.
This time around, they determined that it would be different and, although European money could not be spent on a 
national referendum, suddenly a wide collection of proLisbon groups seemingly mushroomed out of the zeitgeist.
No doubt the Yes side, having secretly spent large amounts of money to probe scientifically the increasingly 
anxious public mood in the middle of our escalating financial crisis, came out determined to frighten voters onto the 
Yes side.
As the electorate has suffered the vista of disappearing jobs, escalating costs and a collapsing economy, selling the 
message that rejecting Lisbon would make it all worse was a no-brainer.
Quite simply, the subtext of the Yes campaign has been that we are approaching financial disaster so we cannot 
afford any political luxuries - including having a row over the federalisation of the European Union.
Euro federalists bully us and buy our vote
It has been as simple as that - and it has been as effective as it has been bogus. Even in a week in which the EU 
sanctioned a huge loan from the Polish government to move Dell jobs from Limerick to Lodz, the Yes voters were 
still brazening out the attractions of the globalisation ambitions of Lisbon.
Astonishingly, even the Irish trade unions don't seem to have spotted that, for multinationals, Lisbon will signal an 
increasing race to the bottom in wages and conditions. Indeed, with EU enlargement beyond our ability to veto, if 
Lisbon comes about, look out for sweat-shop labour conditions to come in Croatia, Turkey and even Ukraine a 
generation down the road.
The Irish political establishment, too, has been calling in all the favours.
It has been fascinating to watch the huge numbers of those who enjoy massive salaries, courtesy of the taxpayer, 
as members of our numerous quangos, come out singing for their supper.
They even have the celebrity clowns out, the former sports stars and the second-hand car salesmen and the 
singers and actors all enjoying their 15 minutes of fame and self-publicity.
But above and beyond this, another development raises serious questions for Irish democracy. Two multinationals - 
Ryanair and Intel - are spending huge sums on the campaign to encourage a Yes vote. That both contributions 
have been largely politically illiterate and that both companies are in need of European benevolence hardly 
diminishes one's concern.
Since when have multinationals thrown their considerable weight and resources into a matter of international and 
domestic importance in Irish politics? Have we become a European Honduras - have we really reached a point in 
European democracy where the bosses can tell the workers how to vote?
Who can keep a straight face while listening to Michael O'Leary extol the virtues of Lisbon's workers' rights 
legislation? Indeed, is there not an implied threat to quit Ireland in Intel's demand for a Yes vote?
Between them, Ryanair and Intel have contributed  700,000 to the Yes campaign, and huge contributions from 
Europe are also pouring in. According to the Times in London, one lobbyist, Eamonn Bates, sent e-mails to fellow 
EU lobbying firms seeking donations of up to  30,000 to help a pro-Lisbon campaign.
Another organisation, established by Irish people working in Brussels who want a Yes result, planned to spend  
500,000 on advertisements.
By the end, it will actually be possible to calculate accurately how much it cost to overthrow the sovereignty of the 
people as expressed in the last referendum.
In these depressing days, we have moved from Europeanisation, to some form of Euro-colonisation as those who 
dare to reject the Euro federalisation agenda are buried under a vast and expensive campaign that has sought to 
frighten and undermine the electorate.
We need hardly argue at this stage what Lisbon II is about. We now know in our waters that it's the key to 
unleashing a European project that, in less than a generation, will once again make this country a tiny and 
insignificant appendage to a vast global enterprise. Its ambitions are no less imperial than those of previous 
European generations and, while the language may have changed, the political objectives have not.
This is ultimately about a United States of Europe emerging, eventually, as a significant world power beside the 
Chinas and the Indias of the future. Its weapons will be unbridled market forces allied with multiculturalism to 
ensure cheap labour markets, and its ethos will be secular and neo-liberal.
Above all, as we can now see, it eschews democracy - local or national - seeking to create instead a type of 'euro-
panocracy' in which, not unlike the old Soviet system, the voters are never limited, just the options they can vote for. 
In a generation or two, Renaissance Europe and all its genius, which so profoundly shaped our European 
civilisation, will have been swept away.
Euro federalists bully us and buy our vote
All it requires now is for poor Paddy to forget the instinct that 'all politics is local' and, come Friday, head for the 
polling station with the price of his soul (what might once have been called the King's shilling) in his hand. Of 
course, it won't be the first time in our history that we could be bought so easily. But at least this will be the very, 
very last time it will be required.

It is encouraging that the government has finally listened to David McWilliams's and others' suggestion that we tap 
into the wealth of knowledge and talent of the great Irish diaspora.
Having met many emigrants over the years, their pride in their heritage is fundamental to their very being.
However, for this exciting adventure to work, it must be a two-way transaction. I do feel that, as a nation, we must 
have more to offer those who share our genes in foreign lands than a light in Aras an Uachtarain.
Jim Jackman, Castleknock, Dublin 15
At least three times in my lifetime, I have witnessed the migration of whole sections of the population from Ireland.
In the 1950s, about half my class year took flight. In the 1980s, my children's generation took flight.
Now, in this decade, my grandchildren's generation seems to be setting off in the same direction. Some may come 
back, but most stayed away.
Appeals to this ever-renewing diaspora cannot solve Ireland's problems, for they are clearly a symptom of a deep 
and persistent malaise affecting Irish society. Pace David McWilliams, ex-president Mary Robinson, our politicians 
and others, a solution must lie elsewhere.
To find that solution, however, one must first identify the problem properly.
Perhaps age has given me an insight, for it seems clear to me that the real malaise is an all-pervading risk 
aversion, leading to begrudgery of those who try, avoidance of competition by those who succeed, and 
condemnation of those who fail.
The diaspora debate
Whether by professional exclusion, union closed shop or social, religious and cultural condemnation, we are adept 
at condemning those who take risks. To solve our problems, we must look to ourselves - honestly, critically and 
even harshly. Only then are we likely to find the cure to the malaise we have inflicted on ourselves.
Myles Tierney, Grange Road, Dublin 16
Ryanair: loyalty is price-deep
The reply by Stephen McNamara, Ryanair's head of communications (Letters, 20/9/09), to the article entitled 'How 
to generate bad profits' was clearly a knee-jerk reaction submitted without proper research.
McNamara totally missed the (in my view) valid point that bad profits can be described as ''earnings at the expense 
of customer relationships''.
This can arise when customers feel that have been badly treated or misled. There is a huge difference between 
customers continuing to support a business because their experience was so positive, and simply continuing to 
support that company because the price is so attractive. Loyalty doesn't enter the equation in the latter example.
When customers are genuinely happy with their experience, not only will they return voluntarily to buy again and 
again, but they will also refer their friends and family. This is the very definition of good profits.
John Hayes, The Simple Marketing, Company, Waterford
Fair Deal for patients
Aileen O'Meara's article (20/9/09), highlighted the problem of bed blocking arising from the delay in introducing the 
Fair Deal.
The Fair Deal, to be introduced later this year, will see the government providing a subsidy to persons requiring 
nursing home care.
The subsidy will make up the difference between the actual costs and the 80 per cent of their pension which 
beneficiaries will be required to provide. In return, the government will obtain up to 15 per cent of the value of those 
people's homes on their demise.
However, this latter figure was calculated at a time when house prices were much higher than at present, and while 
there was an expectation of further increase.
Moreover, government finances have deteriorated sharply in the meantime.
Surely, in these circumstances, it makes sense to seek repayment of a much higher percentage of the value of the 
home. Last-minute revisions have taken place to other schemes to reflect changed circumstances, not least 
national wage agreements, so why not a fairer deal for the taxpayer from the Fair Deal?
Kevin Kavanagh, Sandymount, Dublin 4
Browned off
I must congratulate Vincent Browne on juxtaposing two distinct ideas in his article on the Dail debate on Nama, in 
order to attack Enda Kenny.
Kenny asked that the opposition be invited to workout a consensus alternative to the Nama bill. The government 
had invited only an input into the Nama bill. In other words: ''It's our idea or nothing."
Despite that, Richard Bruton offered nine possible amendments to Nama in a letter to Brian Lenihan.
Browne would be more credible if he did not allow his prejudices to override his critical faculties.
The diaspora debate
Maurice Curtin, Ballintemple, Cork
Vincent Browne's article was a neatly-convoluted example of logical incoherence and ideological loopiness.
In a rambling argument about the supposed fact that Ireland is still a rich country (doubtful at best), he complained 
that this wealth was being inadequately shared, and that the state was spending EUR 20 billion a year more than it 
took in (which is true, and scary).
His supposedly obvious remedy to this problem is to ''reverse the tax-slashing policies of the last decade and use 
the tax instrument to rectify the excesses of inequality''.
Apart from the fact that high taxation is certain to depress wealth-creating activity, Browne's argument is that 
Ireland's inequality is epitomised by the high pay of the Taoiseach and Chief Justice (EUR 365,000), the Tanaiste, 
Supreme Court judges and secretaries general of departments (EUR 341,000), even though these are all examples 
of inequality caused by excessive - indeed, outrageous - state spending, rather than inequality caused by moderate 
taxation.
Contrary to Browne's ideas, we could start to solve many of Ireland's problems by getting the state less involved in 
the life of the country, instead of more.
Similarly, eliminating privileged positions (paid for by high taxes on thousands of struggling workers) and thereby 
lowering the tax burden would help raise the morale of the country and encourage enterprise and wealth creation.
Seeing leading commentators thinking - for once - in straight lines would also help Ireland enormously.

Start from scratch
Samantha McCaughren writes about Grafton Street rents, the closure of shops, footfall down and so on (6/9/09).
She could have gone a stage further as to the cause: rude, arrogant and aggressive scratchcard sellers. Friends 
from abroad have commented on the matter, especially in Henry Street. Reason enough to avoid both 
thoroughfares, many would say.
Noel McAuley, Dublin 7
Liberal bigots
I never thought I'd hear myself saying this, but maximum respect to Tommy Tiernan. While I absolutely disagree 
with his recent anti-Semitic outburst, he has nevertheless (although I suspect inadvertently and unintentionally) 
exposed the hypocrisy of the Dublin 4 chattering classes.
These reactionary liberal bigots were rolling in the aisles when the target was their bete noire, the Catholic Church. 
Now, all of a sudden, they've gone all sensitive and touchy-feely. It really is a joy to witness their discomfort.

Lisbon Letters
FOR
Friday will be a defining day for Ireland's future. A Yes vote underpins our unique position as the only English-
speaking economy in the eurozone and at the core of Europe.
International investors seeking a base in Europe have traditionally viewed our country as an ideal place from which 
to service what is one of the world's biggest markets.
The diaspora debate
A Yes vote sustains this positive perception.
In the debate on Lisbon, we cannot ignore the importance of international sentiment.
Sentiment impacts on all decisions relating to investment or re-location, buying Irish government and bank debt and 
the interest rates that we as taxpayers will pay on our increasing government debt.
A Yes vote enhances international confidence in our ability to face up to our challenges.
We face serious economic tests ahead. Already, institutions such as the European Central Bank are playing a key 
role in helping us to face up to this task. Given our manifest need for support at this time, it is a risk too far for 
Ireland to be perceived to be a 'non-core participant' in the European Union.
To sustain and build on our strong record of attracting international investment, secure our position at the heart of 
Europe and create new opportunities for Irish residents and Irish companies, we urge a Yes vote.
Ian Talbot, chief executive, Chambers Ireland Merrion Square, Dublin 2
In 1848, the dream was of a constellation of sovereign nationstates, not just in Ballingarry, but right across Europe. 
In 1918, it seemed that that dream's moment had come, only for it to crumble horrifically into the nightmare of the 
years 1936 to 1956, once more into the maw of empires.
In 1956 itself, the reality of small state sovereignty was demonstrated once again for slow learners - humiliatingly for 
France and Britain at Suez, bloodily for a betrayed Hungary on the streets of Budapest.
After World War II, the leaders of mainland Western Europe had to face the fundamental question: how does a 
small nation-state survive in a global context systemically hostile to such states?
A similar question faced the leaders of the American Revolution in the 18th century, summed up in the crude 
slogan: ''If we do not 'hang together', we shall assuredly hang separately."
Their solution was the US Constitution of 1787. This created a balance which allowed Vermont to remain Vermont - 
but recognised the statistical weight of Pennsylvania and New York.
It sought a political means of formulating and implementing common purposes. Laboriously, Europe has worked 
towards its own version of such a solution. This question is the growling wolverine under the cabinet table today. 
How do we survive and ensure the achievement of our legitimate socio-economic aspirations?
The answer is by making our own domestic repairs and maintenance, but also by making common cause (through 
voluntary detailed mutually respecting integration) with other small, fragile political entities. Without their solidarity in 
the brutal globalised world where might is right, we face isolation, exclusion, irrelevance and a lonely annihilation.
The European project is the nurtured, shared, state-of-the-art garden within which nations can grow and flourish 
together as distinct entities expressing and implementing their own identity - as our own membership has shown 
again and again.
This - and not greed or fear - are why we must re-affirm our commitment to something a great deal more than a 
bureaucratic formal partnership.
We must see Lisbon not as a threat to our republic, but as the natural step towards its enhancement where we can 
be ourselves - but not alone.
Maurice O'Connell, Tralee, Co Kerry
My motivation for voting Yes to Lisbon is based on pure self-interest - nothing more, nothing less.
The diaspora debate
Ratification of the Lisbon Treaty will ensure that Ireland is better placed to recover from current economic 
difficulties.
Inward investment has always been key to sustaining and creating jobs. It is indisputable that a further rejection of 
the treaty would put our reputation as an attractive destination for multinationals at risk.
At a time of rising unemployment, we simply cannot afford to allow such a scenario to develop. I am supporting the 
Lisbon Treaty because I believe that this is the best way to secure my future and that of my family and friends.
Francis McEvoy, Harolds Cross, Dublin 6
As we go to vote on Lisbon, we must remember that this treaty is the final surrender to the European states. It 
simply is an acknowledgement of our earlier commitment. What have we to lose?
Agricultural decisions are taken in Europe, as are decisions about the fisheries. Our neutral armies are already in 
places like Chad - and all armies are neutral today, according to the British minister of defence.
For God's sake, go forward, be brave and vote Yes. We have nothing to lose.
Clare Mooney, Dungarvan, Co Waterford
AGAINST
The Yes side has most recently been making noises about the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group 
distributing a leaflet on the Lisbon Treaty.
Most foreign involvement has been from, and at the behest of, the Yes side, and Brussels readily obliged with 
attempts to thwart and subvert the Irish democratic process on a number of fronts.
The most insidious of these has been the collusion of the Irish government with foreign interests, namely the 
European Commission - a highly self-interested party, since Lisbon would significantly increase its powers, to the 
legislative and democratic detriment of the peoples of the EU.
This collusion is ongoing with the visit of Jerzy Buzek, president of the same European Parliament that shamefully 
voted not to respect the result of the Irish referendum on Lisbon last year - even before the referendum had taken 
place.
Most recently Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the EU Commission, jetted in and sought to buy us - just in case 
his apocalyptic warnings about a No vote didn't work. Commission officials have been visiting schools, bent on 
indirectly getting at parents to vote Yes through their children. It is unlawful to canvass children under 18 years of 
age.
At the same time, Brussels has been funding Yes campaigns to the hilt. Millions of euro are being channelled from 
groups in the European Parliament into the Yes campaign through MEPs and Irish political parties. As with the 
commission, these groups have a huge vested interest in influencing our referendum result, since a Yes vote would 
greatly increase their powers, while undermining the Dail's.
Olivia Moran, Carraroe, Co Sligo
It was no coincidence that Jose Manuel Barroso, EU Commission president, turned up at Shannon Airport with his 
30 pieces of silver, in the form of a EUR 14.8 million package to help former Dell workers adjust to life without a 
weekly wage packet.
It is obvious that the timing of this package was meant to influence the outcome of Lisbon II, and no doubt it will. It 
may be the last piece in the jigsaw to secure a Yes vote. If this happens, we will no longer have any control over our 
destiny and will remain subservient clones to faceless bureaucrats in Brussels planning the future of this super euro

project. Everyone of voting age in this country has already experienced the first steps of rule from Brussels. On 
Friday, we are to vote on something that we have already voted on - and rejected. Shouldn't the alarm bells be 
ringing?
J Woods, Gort a Choirce, Dun na nGall
How desperate is the EU to change the minds of honest Irish people in Friday's referendum?
It is pouring funds into the Yes campaign. Should it not - if only in the interests of the democracy of which they 
speak - pour an equal amount into the No campaign?
Mike Shaw, Suffolk, England
Immediately after the last Irish referendum, European leaders - particularly the president of France - showed their 
unbridled arrogance.
Officials who, in 26 of the 27 EU countries, were depriving citizens of the right to vote on the treaty in essence told 
the citizens of Ireland: ''Since you did not provide the right response, we are asking you to vote again." Six months 
later, the European Council confirmed this injunction for a new referendum on the same treaty (because the 
''assurances'' they provided have not changed the text one iota).
What disdain they are showing toward Irish voters, who are being told: ''You didn't quite understand the first time." 
Denying any consultation with the populations of nearly every nation, while annulling the results where they do not 
''conform'' to what they want is an attack on democracy so grotesque that it could almost be funny, were the stakes 
not so high. Our Norwegian friends, who are as European as the French or the Irish, have always voted against 
joining the European Union.
Norway is today the European nation that has been least affected by the economic crisis (with an unemployment 
rate of less than three per cent).
The people of Ireland are a proud people with a great sense of solidarity. We are again counting on you, because 
no other people have been given the right to speak. We thank you in advance, from the bottom of our hearts, for 
your No vote.

This week, Irish citizens are going to vote for the second time on the Lisbon Treaty (formerly the European 
Constitution).
The rest of Europe's citizens have been denied the right to vote on it even once. Many of us have nonetheless 
studied the document and are familiar with its deficits.
It is less democratic than the constitutions of any of the member countries, it demands the increase of military 
capability in all member countries, while paying only lip service to peaceful structures, and it gives priority to capital 
interests over social and environmental interests.
The diaspora debate
In Munich, we held ''symbolic referendums'', and 95 per cent of our public voted No on these three counts. They 
clearly understood that they were not voting against Europe, but only against this undemocratic document.
We were jubilant when the Irish voted No last year, and felt you were voting for us. Please do it again.
Sue Duerr Munich, Germany
What lucky people the Irish are to be allowed to vote for a second time on the constitution / Treaty of Lisbon, when 
we in Britain are not allowed to vote at all, our government having broken its election promise of a referendum.
We have to look on, gagged and silenced, while the Irish vote again - and perhaps yet again, if they don't give the 
''right'' answer this time.
In the strange world our masters in Brussels inhabit, No means Yes. When the French and the Dutch voted No, the 
EU declared that they really meant Yes. But a Yes vote never means No, and there is never a second referendum 
for a Yes vote.
Denise Ace, Devon, England
The core issue for Ireland is the real threat to our constitution (which, a recent writer wrote, was used as a blueprint 
by no less than 68 countries). The ''guarantees'' given to Ireland by the European Council ministers are little more 
than political promises, and are not part of the treaty.
They are worth about as much as our present government's ''promise'' to hand over Cork Airport, debt-free - and we 
know how that finished.
Should we vote to ratify Lisbon, our constitution will be superseded by and become subordinate to the European 
Court of Justice and its instrument, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is in favour of abortion, 
euthanasia, embryo experimentation and same-sex marriage.
Article 6.1 of our constitution says: ''All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, 
from the people, to decide all questions of national policy according to the requirements of the common good."
Where will all these rights and recognitions end up? On the scrapheap.
Gus Hennessy, Douglas, Cork
''The EU is neither undemocratic nor a centralised superstate'' says A Leavy (Letters 20/9/09). But our political 
masters, in their federalist zeal, chose to ignore the referendum results in Ireland, the Netherlands and France.
Democracy, indeed.
No amount of window-dressing about accountability and transparency can alter the fact that Lisbon will mean 
greater centralisation of power in Brussels. I refuse to be intimidated and bullied into voting Yes.

The press is votingYes to Lisbon, and not only on the editorial pages. Catherine O'Mahony reports.
Letters to virtually all the main newspapers are heaving with indignation over the Lisbon Treaty, but if general press 
coverage is an accurate barometer, the Yes vote is certain to prevail in the upcoming referendum.
That's the only conclusion to be drawn from a series of media analyses by TNS Media Intelligence. It has been 
monitoring coverage of Lisbon in the national papers since the start of July.
Its latest weekly report found Yes campaigners gained two points to command 46 per cent of press coverage, 
compared with 23 per cent for the No camp.
The single week is not, however, the most compelling evidence of the slant in the press.
According to Dan Halliwell, commercial director of TNS Media Intelligence, an even more skewed tendency is 
evident in the cumulative figures. He said that it was partly a question of the personalities on both sides.
The Yes camp had had the larger number of established names on its side from the start, led by Brian Cowen, 
Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore.
The more recent addition to the camp of media personalities such as Ryanair's Michael O'Leary and Eamon 
Dunphy has done the Yes camp no harm.
Last year's No camp hero, Declan Ganley, has made a late entry to the debate - which should help matters 
somewhat for the No side, but not enough to make a large difference, according to Halliwell.
So far, statistics are showing that Ganley's entry has made very little difference to the No cause, with most articles 
discussing merely why the entrepreneur had come back at all.
Lisbon overwhelmingly backed by national papers
The research showed that only 28 per cent of articles about Ganley in the week after he returned to the fray had an 
antiLisbon stance. ''If you look at all the main areas that have come up for discussion regarding Lisbon, the Yes 
side appears to have won the argument in pretty much every case," said Halliwell.
Halliwell said that the negative coverage on Lisbon was mainly confined to newspapers' letters pages, and not 
coming primarily from journalists. The research showed that the top ten issues to have come up for discussion in 
the press on Lisbon since July 1 were, in order of importance, tax, the Irish guarantee, Nama, the Irish 
commissioner, neutrality, abortion, farming, Bord Snip Nua, Germany's dominance of the EU, and defence policy.
Since July 1, 45 per cent of press coverage on the tax implications of Lisbon has been positive, 31 per cent neutral 
and only 24 per cent negative.
On Irish guarantees, 55 per cent of the coverage has been positive, 18 per cent neutral and 27 per cent negative. 
Nama is attracting mainly neutral comment, in a Lisbon context, and 55 per cent of coverage on the Irish 
commissioner has been positive in tone.
However, Halliwell said that he expected Ganley to exert a heavier influence on the press in the final week before 
polling.
In the first week after he joined the fight, there were 68 articles about him in the national press, more than double 
the number regarding Coir (33 articles) and even further ahead of Sinn Fein, which was the subject of 31 articles.
Coir had a significant - but mostly negative - presence, with the majority of articles critical of the group's advertising 
tactics. Just six articles supported the No message on behalf of Coir.
The UK Independence Party entered the top five antiLisbon campaigners for the first time last week, with 22 
articles.
However, once again, just a third of this coverage delivered a No message, amid much criticism of the notion that 
the party should involve itself at all in an Irish issue.
However, Halliwell said that the information excluded regional press, broadcasters and blogs. The press coverage 
picture also cannot be compared with that of the last treaty. Still, with opinion polls indicating a Yes vote, the 
research shows categorically how papers are doing their best to support the trend.

As Christoph Mueller, the new chief executive of Aer Lingus, steels himself for the first of many battles with unions 
over radical plans to strip out  100million in costs, he can at least console himself that his noisy peer across the car 
park at Dublin Airport will give him a little breathing space.
Last week, Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, used his airline's agm to play down speculation about a 
third attempt to take over Aer Lingus.
O'Leary said it was ''highly unlikely'' that a third offer would be made any time soon, but he was uncharitable in 
outlining his reasons why.
According to O'Leary, Aer Lingus remains doomed to stumble through the tough, recession-filled years that lie 
ahead, slowly but surely eroding its cash reserves, while it beavers away in its efforts to return to profitability.
Once the cash runs out, Aer Lingus will, in O'Leary's mind, need its shareholders to stump up and ensure that its 
planes can remain in the sky. And that could be its downfall as an independent entity. Attempts to tap shareholders 
for cash will not be helped by Aer Lingus's complicated ownership. With a cash-strapped government holding 25 
per cent of the airline and unions and staff (whose pockets are hardly overflowing) holding 15 per cent, Mueller 
would be unwise to expect them to follow their money in a future fundraising.
Which leaves a relatively small number of institutional shareholders - and Ryanair. O'Leary would be only too 
pleased to inject more money into his domestic rival - but only in return for control.
Mueller will hope it won't come to that and that staff will recognise the urgency of Aer Lingus getting its house in 
order.
But the doomsday clock is already ticking.

The return of takeover talk is prompting investors to seek companies that look undervalued, writes Ellen Kelleher
Body
Fund managers are now on the prowl for companies that could be caught up in the wave of mergers that is 
expected across Europe in the coming weeks.
Kraft's $10.2bn offer for Cadbury earlier this month may be just the taster of further to come, say some. Near the 
top of their list are Aer Lingus, the Irish airline that has a market capitalisation of EUR350m and net cash of about 
EUR330m; Bloomsbury, the publishing company that has £37m in cash; and Man Group, the hedge fund manager 
that currently looks relatively cheap, trading on 14 times next year's earnings, and offering a 9 per cent dividend 
yield.
AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceutical giants that boast strong credit ratings and balance sheets, 
may also be looking to acquire smaller biotech companies to bolster their drug offerings.
There are several factors fuelling the confidence that takeover activity is about to return. With deposit rates hovering 
near zero, takeovers tempt companies that have large cash reserves and want to improve their return on capital. 
But groups with less cash can also shop around as it is quite easy to raise funds in corporate debt markets at the 
moment, say analysts. Also, they face little competition from the private equity sector as many firms took a hit at the 
height of the financial downturn last year and are still struggling to meet commitments. Sterling's current weakness 
also offers the chance for European and US companies to consider taking over UK rivals.
"It's very important for companies to be able to continue to cut costs and drive earnings growth," claims George 
Godber, co-fund manager of S&W Matterley's undervalued returns fund. "If you are a cash-rich company at the 
moment, you can acquire a smaller or weaker competitor without the competitive threat of private equity."
Currently, deals are more likely to be funded by companies with better balance sheets as lending by banks remains 
constrained, says Paras Anand, head of European equities with F&C.
Prepare to surf a wave of mergers
"People are willing to assess more closely whether one business will add value to another one and the economies 
of scale that deals are likely to achieve will come under scrutiny," he says. "Executives are looking to bolster growth 
in what looks like a weak year, but they want to take a disciplined approach."
After pharmaceuticals, it is the airline, financial services and media sectors where consolidation is most anticipated.
Aer Lingus remains under hostile takeover pressure from its low-cost rival Ryanair, for example.
The fund management sector is also expected to see a spate of takeovers, following BlackRock's purchase of BGI 
from Barclays and Aberdeen Asset Management's acquisition of Credit Suisse Asset Management.
Another way to profit from the trend is to take bigger stakes in boutique finance companies and investment banks 
such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - as they may well see revenues rise if business gathers pace.
A few months ago, Bruce Wasserstein, chief executive at Lazard forecast that there would be a "gradual increase" 
in "traditional" M&A activity that would peak in four years' time.
So far, Wasserstein's predictions appear to be on target as Lazard's balance sheet looks rosier than it was a year 
ago.
The company's revenues from M&A activity exceeded expectations in the second quarter, rising to$135m 
from$97m in the previous three months. Expecting a flurry of deals, the company also bolstered its earnings 
estimates for next year from $2.15 to $2.40 per share.

Issue. Significantly, this was the first bond issue of its kind from any Irish bank since the Government Guarantee 
was introduced in September 2008. The deal was priced at a spread over mid-swaps of 250 basis points with in

was oversubscribed by 2.9 times. Shares in C and C fell by 2c to E2.93 after shareholders today overwhelmingly

European equity markets fell yesterday after unexpectedly weak US housing data left a cloud over construction and 
building materials stocks.
HeidelbergCement  fell in spite of ratings agency Moody's Investors Service changing its outlook on the cement 
maker's B1 rating to positive from negative. Analyst Matthias Hellstern was impressed with the success of the 
company's new share issue this week, which raised EUR2.25bn.
But the shares, which had risen more than 10 per cent since Monday's placement, were down 4.7 per cent to 
EUR42.40 yesterday, making it the worst performer on the FTSE Eurofirst 300.
The pan-European index ended the session down 1.9 per cent to 987.37, its biggest loss in three weeks.
Swiss cement group Holcim  fell 1.7 per cent to SFr70.90 while French construction group Bouygues  lost 3.2 per 
cent to EUR34.67 and Spain's Sacyr-Vallehermoso fell 2.7 per cent to EUR12.76.
Airline stocks reacted to research by Citigroup that noted that over the past three months, many shares in the 
sector have doubled from their year-lows "based purely on appetite for early cyclicals".
But analyst Andrew Light warned that the sector was "still suffering from overcapacity, inefficient cost structures and 
depressed demand", and expected the industry to make record losses this year. Citi's top picks were the "recent 
laggards", among them Lufthansa  and Ryanair .
But the broker downgraded its ratings on Sweden's SAS and Air France-KLM . "These are among the strongest 
performers of the last three months and are vulnerable to any disappointments," Mr Light said.
SAS fell 3.3 per cent to SKr4.7 while Air France lost 3.5 per cent to EUR12.37. Ryanair lost 3.4 per cent to 
EUR3.49 and Lufthansa down 0.8 per cent to EUR12.17.
Building groups hit by US data
Hennes & Mauritz , the Swedish fashion group, fell 4.3 per cent to SKr391 after its third-quarter sales 
disappointed.

Irish shares slipped lower this morning in line with European and world trends.
Banks were hit in the wake of news that world central bankers are to scale back infusions of US dollars into their

Irish Life and Permanent off by 5c to 545. Bank of Ireland was unchanged at 295. Away from the financials, CRH

Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary has said the low cost carrier is prepared to invest more money in Aer 
Lingus.
Speaking at his company's agm, Mr O'Leary said: "I do think Aer Lingus will need a major reorganisation and they 
will come back to the existing shareholders."
These, he said, would be the government, the trade unions and Ryanair.
"We'd be happy to invest more money in Aer Lingus." He added, however, that he saw it as highly unlikely that 
Ryanair would make another bid for the airline. Mr O'Leary also said it would be at least three or four years until 
Ryanair launched its own long haul associate airline. And he put the delay down to a lack of affordable aircraft. 
"While the market or orders for short-haul aircraft has collapsed for both Boeing and Airbus the long-haul orderbook 
has held up," he said. He also revealed that Ryanair may break one of its own fundamental rules by paying a 
dividend to shareholders this year. He said such a payment would be a once off event.

Body
The Dublin shares market fell sharply this morning as risk aversion dominated world markets and as Sterling fell to 
a five-month low against the euro.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 30.59 points at 3,373.7.
Britain is Ireland's biggest single trading partner and exporters as well as Irish firms with big businesses interests in 
the UK have been suffering from Sterling's relative weakness against the euro.
This afternoon, a euro was worth £0.9118 after reaching £0.9136 this morning. The fall in Sterling also came as 
caution ahead of the Group of 20 summit prompted investors to cut back on risky assets. The ISEQ's losses 
mirrored those elsewhere in Europe. Europe's main stock markets were lower this morning after losses on Wall 
Street as markets reacted cautiously to positive comments made by the US Federal Reserve last night. The Fed 
upgraded its assessment of the US economy, saying growth had returned after a deep recession, while reiterating 
its promise to hold interest rates very low for a long time. Banks were mixed with shares in AIB up 2c to E3.27 while 
Bank of Ireland fell 5c to E3.09 and Irish Life and Permanent was off 18c to E5.69 as investors took profits from the 
share's rally earlier this week. Chief Executive of Permanent TSB, David Guinane, appeared before the Oireachtas 
Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service yesterday to discuss the bank's interest rate policy. The hearing 
was prompted by the bank's decision to raise its Standard Variable Rate by 0.5pc to 3.19pc. He attributed the 
increase to the fact that margins on loans had fallen to an eight-year low (reflecting higher funding costs) and to 
rising loan impairments (management has guided E700m over a three-year period). Shares in Ryanair edged up 2c 
to E3.63. Ryanair is "highly unlikely" to make a third bid for Aer Lingus but it is prepared to "invest more money" in 
the rival airline, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said today. "I do think Aer Lingus will need a major reorganisation 
... and they will come back to the existing shareholders which would be the government, the trade unions and

invest more money in Aer Lingus." Aer Lingus shares rose by 2c to E0.80. CRH's shares fell by 26c to E19.20. 
Almost 40pc of US stimulus funds have been put to work in highways, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers, with 
over USD1.8bn had been paid to contractors using funds from the USD26.8bn stimulus package for highways. 
Further analysis by ARTBA (American Road Transportation Builders Association) shows that a total of 3,455 
projects are now under construction with a value of just over USD.10bn

The Dublin shares market fell sharply as risk aversion dominated world markets after global central banks said they 
would scale back infusions of U.S. dollars into their banking systems.
At the close, the ISEQ was down 89.79 points to 3,314.57.
Meanwhile, sterling slumped again. Britain is Ireland's biggest single trading partner and exporters as well as Irish 
firms with big businesses interests in the UK have been suffering from Sterling's relative weakness against the 
euro.
World shares markets fell on news the US Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, would reduce programs 
to provide institutions with short-term liquidity, a sign the removal of extraordinary monetary stimulus was under 
way. Sales of existing homes unexpectedly fell in August after several months of strong reports, which investors 
viewed as evidence housing had finally bottomed out. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 40.13 points, or 
0.41 percent, at 9,707.06. Banks were down sharply with shares in AIB falling 6c to E3.19 while Bank of Ireland fell 
13c to E3.09 and Irish Life and Permanent was off 37c to E5.50 as investors took profits from the share's rally 
earlier this week. Chief Executive of Permanent TSB, David Guinane, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint

extraordinary meeting of shareholders for November 3 after a call for such a meeting from shareholder Denis 
O'Brien. The company said two resolutions would be put to shareholders. These are Mr O'Brien's proposals to 
remove Brian Hillery from his post of chairman of the group and to appoint a new senior independent director - a

Irish shares dipped in early trade today, following a downward global trend in the wake of yesterday's policy 
meeting of the US Fed.
The ISEQ index was 43.60 points lower a short time ago at 3,360.76, after two days of gains.
Markets have reacted negatively to a decision by the Fed to scale down purchases of mortgage debt.
Analysts say such a move and other cutbacks could undermine the recovery of the US financial sector. Irish shares 
slipped lower this morning, in line with their counterparts elsewhere. AIB was down 9c at 315, with Bank of Ireland 
off by 8c at 306 and Irish Life and Permanent moving 22c lower to 565. Other big shares were also in negative 
territory, with CRH dropping 48c to 1905 and DCC down 16c to 1725. Drug maker Elan slipped by 7c to 489, while 
low cost carrier Ryanair eased by 8c to 352.

airline, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said today.
"I do think Aer Lingus will need a major reorganisation ... and they will come back to the existing shareholders 
which would be the government, the trade unions and Ryanair, presumably to raise some more money," O'Leary 
told a Ryanair shareholder meeting.
"We'd be happy to invest more money in Aer Lingus."
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had kept its forecast for full-year net profit towards the bottom of a E200 million to E300 
million range.

Michael O'Leary's comments about the European Commission are normally peppered with expletives, writes John 
Murray Brown in Dublin .
But the chief executive of Ryanair says his company is spending EUR500,000 ($740,000, £450,000) promoting a 
Yes vote in next week's Lisbon referendum, and no doubt promoting the airline's cause to boot.
Intel, the US chip manufacturer, is also spending EUR200,000 to support the Yes side.
The company on Tuesday unveiled its first billboard advertisements and bus stop posters.
Why have they got involved? "If other sensible business people and job creators in this country don't, we leave it to 
the incompetent politicians, who will probably mess up the referendum all on their own," says Mr O'Leary.
The No side have called the role of multinationals "obscene".
Jimmy Kelly, Irish regional secretary of Unite, a trade unions opposed to Lisbon, which has clashed with Ryanair 
over workers' rights and union recognition, says Mr O'Leary's contribution may backfire.
"If he was on television and radio every day giving out like that, I would guarantee there would be a No vote."

The Dublin shares market put in a lacklustre performance as investors awaited new leads.
The ISEQ gained 18.69 points to 3,404.36.
ISEQ investors looked to the US as the Federal Reserve prepared to issue a keenly awaited policy statement. With 
the Fed likely to keep interest rates unchanged, investors focused on whether the central bank will signal any 
change in a policy that has flooded markets with cheap money. The Fed's statement was expected after the close 
of the Dublin market. The Fed will likely say it is encouraged by signs of recovery, but it is just a budding recovery 
that needs the lubricant of low interest rates to continue, analysts say.
Shares in CRH fell by 43c to E19.20 in the morning before rallying to close 9c lower at E19.54. After the latest 
Architectural Billings Index (a 6-12 month leading indicator for US non-residential activity) shows a decline in 
August to 41.7 from 43.1 in July. This follows a significant increase in July from the June reading of 37.7. With the 
index now below the critical 50 level since Jan-08, it continues to point to contraction in the non-residential sector. 
However, Goodbody Stockbrokers said that it is of note that the inquiries index was up strongly in August to 55.2, 
which reverses a recent downward trend (56.8 April, 55.2 May, 53.8 June and 50.3 in July). The EU Commission 
yesterday adopted draft laws that will tighten bank supervision and, it says ensure, the current financial crisis never 
happens again. It said the aim of the new laws is to reinforce financial stability throughout the EU; to ensure that the 
same basic technical rules are applied and enforced consistently; to identify risks in the system at an early stage; 
and to be able to act together far more effectively in emergency situations and in resolving disagreements among 
supervisors. Shares in AIB gained 14c to E3.24, Bank of Ireland rose 5c to E3.10 and Irish Life and Permanent 
climbed 17c to E5.87. Ryanair is due to publish an AGM statement later today (Thursday). Mr O'Leary railed last 
year in the statement against Aer Lingus, the European Commission, the UK Competition Authority and 
screenscrapers, but there were also a few words on the trading front. Similar to last year, analysts anticipate that 
Ryanair will highlight the difficult operating environment. Last year, oil was falling, but the company warned the

benefit may be given away in lower yields into the winter. This year, oil is more stable, having risen for the past 2 
quarters and we are pencilling in a 19pc decline in yields for Q3 after a 20pc figure in Q2. Shares in the airline rose 
7c to E3.61. In a safety update issued on 17 September, US authorities noted that 13 cases of a potentially fatal 
brain disease have now been reported in patients taking Elan's Tysabri, up from 11 when its US partner, Biogen 
Idec stopped its weekly updates in July. Goodbody notes that, although the rate is still well below the one in 1000 
that the FDA considers acceptable, given the undoubted efficacy of Tysabri, what is of interest is that in the update 
the FDA stated that "the risk for developing PML appears to increase with the number of Tysabri infusions 
received". Elan's shares rose 14c to E4.99.

Weak legal regulation of the engineering industry in Ireland, including the software sector, can jeopardise public 
safety and squander taxpayers' money, according to the President of Engineers Ireland Dr Chris Horn.
In his presidential address, the founder of Iona Technologies told engineers in Dublin today that Engineers Ireland 
wants statutory regulation introduced for engineers to protect the public's wellbeing.
"At the minute, the engineering profession is out of step with other disciplines such as architecture where there is 
statutory regulation, and which allows follow through if there are major incidents involving public safety. 
Government needs to safeguard the public against unprofessional engineering judgement and poor analysis."
He said that, while there had been great improvements in software design in recent years, technology needed to be 
vetted in a similar manner to that being considered for the broader engineering industry. "Currently the Irish 
engineering profession is weakly regulated and compares unfavourably to certain other jurisdictions such as 
Canada where professional certification of all engineering works which may impact health or safety is legally 
required." "The HSE abandoned the PPARS system in July 2007 at a cost of some E220 million due significantly to 
software failures. In one incident, one employee was overpaid E1 million as part of an electronic funds transfer error 
in the system. This may have been avoided by more rigorous professional software engineering under a more 
robust regulatory framework. Other more prosaic examples include the collapse of the Ryanair and Aer Lingus web 
sites in recent years due to poor software engineering." Dr Horn highlighted several infamous incidents worldwide 
where software failures resulted in human life being lost or put at risk. "In late September 1983, a software failure in 
a Russian early warning system mistook sunlight reflecting off clouds as missile plumes from a NATO nuclear 
missile attack, almost sparking a catastrophic counter-strike at the height of the Cold War. In 1991, there were 28

deaths in Saudi Arabia after a US Patriot Missile malfunction destroyed a US army barracks due to a software 
rounding error."

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has offered to debate the Lisbon Treaty with one of its chief opponents, Declan Ganley.
The airline chief executive described the Libertas founder as a "failed politician".
O'Leary made the offer as he insisted that a "yes" vote on the treaty would help the Irish economy.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by a Tipperary farmer to a ruling barring him from 
challenging the legality of the second Lisbon referendum. The Court dismissed the appeal by John Gerard Burke, 
saying nothing in the Constitution barred the holding of a referendum, even if it was a second referendum on the

The Dublin shares market rose modestly again after Monday's sell-off on renewed hopes that the world economy - 
and especially the US - is on the cusp of a strong recovery.
The ISEQ rose 15.78 points to 3,385.67.
shares in the banks disappointed with AIB down 9c to E3.10, Bank of Ireland edged up just 1c to E3.08 but Irish Life 
and Permanent surged by 50c to E5.70.
Brian Lenihan has confirmed that a lot of the NAMA set-up would be in place by Christmas. He also shed some light 
on what the end game was likely to be with Anglo Irish Bank, with a number of options such as "downsizing and 
selling it to someone else or running it as nationalised bank to fund business" all set to be considered in time. Cider 
is outperforming in a weak Irish drinks market, according to the latest data from the Irish Revenue Commissioners. 
Net excise receipts and volumes clearance (which we use as a proxy for consumption) for cider are growing this 
year, while the data for beer and spirits show these categories declining. Irish net excise receipts for cider grew 
+2.2pc year-on-year in August. Cider net excise receipts for the first half of C and C's financial year (beginning 
March to end August) showed growth of 2.7pc. C and C's shares were down 2c at E3.01. HeidelbergCement - a 
European peer of CRH - this morning issued details of its share issue and the placement of shares by its majority 
shareholder. In total, the transaction will place 119.6m shares at E37 per share. Under the primary placing, 62.5m 
new shares will be placed subject to a claw-back on 7.8m shares or 12pc. This will raise net proceeds of 
approximately E2.25bn. CRH shares slumped 42c to E19.63. Davy said that the best shares buy in the global 
airlines market is Ryanair, easyJet and Lufthansa. "With Ryanair having positively established itself above its long-

Vincent Flynn established Eolas Recruitment in 1999. The company specialises in IT recruitment for permanent and 
contract positions, and has a turnover in excess of  17,000,000. It has 11 staff and is based in Wicklow town.
What are the main responsibilities of your job?
As a business owner, I am responsible for staff management and motivation. I oversee internal recruitment and 
training and assist staff with any difficult situations that might arise, including negotiation or mediation between 
clients and candidates.
I manage cashflow and advertising, and devise enhancements for our web presence. Every day presents new 
challenges. After 21 years in IT recruitment, the job is as interesting as ever tome.
What are your professional motivators?
I am motivated by the diversity my role offers. It involves building relationships with clients from a wide variety of 
industry sectors. Taking graduates with no knowledge of the IT recruitment industry, and watching them learn and 
flourish is another big motivator.
I have enjoyed watching the company grow to the position it now holds within the IT recruitment market. No matter 
how long you are in this business, it will always throw you a new challenge. I enjoy having the skills to deal with 
that.
How would you describe your work style?
I am passionate, protective, professional and competitive.
What is the best decision you have made in business?
Working Week
Setting up Eolas Recruitment in 1999 and then moving the company to Wicklow town six years later. As we all lived 
locally it made sense; staff get in earlier and get home to their families at a more realistic time, which makes for a 
happier place to work.
In the 90s I spent eight years in Bedfordshire working for one of the largest IT recruitment companies in the UK and 
found then that happier staff tend to be more productive.
We managed over 1,000 contract staff in London without any problems, so I can't for the life of me figure out why 
anyone wants to spend up to four hours a day in traffic. From Wicklow Town we can be in Dublin city centre in 50 
mins when required, and since moving to Wicklow our figures have improved year on year .
What is the most valuable lesson you have learned?
Stick to what you are good at and don't try and be all things to all men. It is vitally important to know that not all 
business is good business.
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. He is a no-nonsense businessman who keeps his eyes on the prize at 
all times. He knows what makes industry work and never allows himself to be pushed around.
He has consistently proved his competitors wrong and has created a model that they now all follow. I like him 
because he is controversial and knows that it is only through controversy that you will bring change.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
We will continue to see a decline in manufacturing in this country, without it ever returning. Ireland will have to adapt 
to the challenges presented by lower cost economies around the world.
We cannot compete with labour costs in some of these markets. The trend is a natural process within tertiary, or 
service, economies like Ireland. It will not change. In areas such as IT technology and green energy, however, 
Ireland is a shining light. These are the sectors we must focus on and exploit in the future.
What is your ultimate professional goal?
To keep Eolas Recruitment at the front line of IT recruitment in Ireland.

News In Brief
## An Irish domiciled unit of fund management giant Pioneer is facing legal action in the US over its USD 1.08 
billion exposure to funds operated by convicted fraudster Bernard Madoff. Pioneer Alternative Investment 
Management, whose registered office is at George's Quay in Dublin, was manager of and adviser to a number of 
Austrian hedge funds which made indirect investments in accounts managed by Bernard L Madoff Investment 
Securities in the US. "The company is named, along with other persons, as a defendant to certain allegations by 
investors in the affected funds," says a note in accounts for Pioneer Alternative Investment Management. - Irish

## A back-bench Fianna Fail TD has said the Minister for Finance should be completely removed from the process 
of deciding how much NAMA will pay for bad bank loans. Sean Fleming was speaking at the party's think-in in 
Athlone. He sais he was not happy with the valuation process for toxic assets, with media reports suggesting that 
Minister Brian Lenihan only intends to impose a 30pc discount on peak property prices. Mr Fleming says he 
believes the minister should be completely removed from the process and, if any dispute over values arises, a High 
Court judge should make the final decision. - Irish Independent

While the ISEQ gained ground again today, bank shares held the index back ahead of this afternoon's unveiling of 
details of NAMA.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had risen by 26.58 points to 3,335.71.
Minister Lenihan will later today announce the scale of the discount which the National Asset Management Agency 
will apply to loans it will purchase from the country's banks. Analysts expect it to purchase loans worth between E55 
billion and E60 billion after it has applied a discount of 30pc. He is expected to outline full details of the purchase of 
borrowings from the banks after the order of business in the Dail this afternoon. Minister Lenihan is expected to give 
an overall figure for the discount on loans which NAMA will buy. That figure is expected to be in the region of 30pc. 
But the Government is likely to stress that the discount on bubble property prices will be much higher.
Shares in AIB fell by 13c to E2.57 and Bank of Ireland declined 10c to E2.68. Irish Life and Permanent, which will 
not directly be affected by NAMA having far lower exposure to developer bad loans, gained 7c to E5.85. Ryanair 
has announced two more bases, with two aircraft and nine new routes at Bari and one aircraft and four new routes 
at Brindisi. Ryanair now has up to 36 bases overall, and ten in Italy, including Bari and Brindisi. It had 23pc of this 
summer's international European market into/out of Italy, and should be able to increasingly 'own' this market. A few 
domestic routes in there should help with sector lengths, according to Davy. Meanwhile, IATA has predictably 
increased its forecast net losses for the year for the industry to USD11bn. Shares in the no-frills airline gained 9c to 
E3.61. Sales the US health and personal care stores sector in August rose by 0.4pc month-on-month and 2.9pc 
year-on-year. This is the principal channel through which Glanbia subsidiary Optimum Nutrition markets its range of 
whey-based sports nutrition supplements. Sales growth in the health and personal stores sector has persisted - 
almost uniquely - in an overall retail sales context through the economic downturn. Glanbia's shares fell 8c to 
E2.70. Shares in Smurfit Kappa rose by 12c to E5.90. Following its recent success in implementing a E60 a tonne 
Bank shares fall ahead of NAMA unveiling ISEQ Up
containerboard price increase, the Dublin firm has announced a further E60 per tonne increase for brown 
containerboard across all European markets from October 1st. The company cites the need to recover rising input 
costs as the main reason for the increase. Market conditions, however, are increasingly supportive with inventory 
levels below 500,000 tonnes and activity levels picking up, Goodbody said.

While the ISEQ gained ground strongly again, bank shares held the index back after the Government unveiling of 
details of NAMA.
The index climbed 55.35 points to 3,364.48.
Shareholders in the top two remaining listed private banks sold off after Finance Minister, Brian Lenihan, said 
NAMA will buy loans from the five top banks to the value of E77 billion. The discount or "haircut" will be in the 
region of 30pc, he said.
Shares in AIB fell 6c to E2.63 and Bank of Ireland's stocks dropped 3c to E2.75 after a sustained rally this month. 
NAMA will buy E24 billion in loans from AIB; E28 billion from Anglo Irish; E16 billion from Bank of Ireland; E1 billion 
from EBS and E8 billion from EBS. Shares in AIB fell by 13c to E2.57 and Bank of Ireland declined 10c to E2.68. 
Irish Life and Permanent, which will not directly be affected by NAMA having far lower exposure to developer bad 
loans, gained 7c to E5.85. He said the current market value of the loans held by the main banks is around E47 
billion, Minister Lenihan told the Dail today. He said that the estimate for the long-term economic value added 
another E7 billion. He said banks cannot be forced to sell assets at below rational prices. The Minister said two-
thirds of the loans related to assets in the State, with one-fifth in Britain. Mr Lenihan said NAMA would need a rise 
in property prices of less than 10pc from current levels over 10 years to break even. He said 40pc of the loans 
NAMA planned to take on were currently producing cash flow, and would cover interest payments on the bonds 
NAMA was issuing to the banks. Elsewhere, Ryanair has announced two more bases, with two aircraft and nine

The Independent
OECD's composite leading indicators on Friday revealed that "clear signs of recovery are now visible" in all seven 
of the leading Western economies, as well as in each of the key "Bric" nations; British economy grows 0.3% in three 
months.
Financial Times
High-earning financiers who are unhappy with Gordon Brown's plans for a 50% top rate of income tax are being 
targeted by Swiss cantons hoping to persuade them to decamp to the alpine air and light tax regime; the marketing 
drive is aimed primarily at Mayfair's hedge fund industry. Mario Nava, the head of the European Commission's 
financial market infrastructure unit, said that European firms are certain to face higher costs for using over-the-
counter derivatives as a result of proposed reforms for such markets in the wake of the crisis. Bank of America 
president Tom Montag on Thursday named Andrea Orcel to be the US bank's executive chairman, global nanking 
and markets, based in London; Orcel will be responsible for sales and trading efforts in addition to continuing to 
oversee investment banking initiatives. Germany's finance minister, Peer Steinbrck, has called for a global tax to be 
imposed on financial transactions in an effort to end what he derided as binge-drinking on markets; he said that 
receipts from the tax would be used to repay the cost to governments of tackling the crisis, including fiscal stimuli 
and bank rescue operations. The FT House Price Index for August showed that house prices in England and Wales 
edged up in August, although transaction levels remain low by historic standards and raise questions; the index 
increases by 0.4% from its level in July, showing a year-on-year decline of 8.6%. The Daily Mail
French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Friday unveiled a new carbon tax to help combat global warming that will cost 
the average family more than £100 a year.
Lord Turner believes Britain is over the worst of the financial crisis, as the 'system is now fairly stable' and the 
chances of a sudden lurch back are 'very low indeed'.
Sir Win Bischoff, incoming chairman at Lloyds Banking Group, said any attempt to reduce the size of the UK's 
financial services industry would be 'short-sighted' and 'could ultimately impoverish us all'
Manufacturers saw input costs rise 2.2%, the biggest increase in more than a year, during August thanks to a 9.4% 
rise in crude prices, the Office for National Statistics said; prices at the factory gate rose by just 0.2%.
Saturday Papers: OECD sees 'clear signs' of recovery
A study by U.S. experts has revealed that Ryanair topped the European league for 'stealth charges' after registering 
73% increase in the so-called 'ancillary revenue' to £548 million a year between 2006 and 2008.
The Institute of Directors and the Taxpayers' Alliance issued a blueprint for the kind of cuts necessary to plug the 
huge deficit in the UK's finances - forecast to soar to £1.4 trillion; the blue-print does detail 34 savings that could be 
made - some of which would lead to massive controversy.
Sir Peter Job, chairman of Shell's remuneration committee, will retire from that role at the end of this month and 
leave the company next year, the firm said; Hans Wijers, a former Dutch economics minister who is chief executive 
of AkzoNobel, will replace Sir Peter.
Heavyweights from the hedge fund and private equity industries on Friday lined up to attack Poul Rasmussen, the 
architect of a controversial European investments directive, which they claim threatens their business and the 
competitiveness of the City of London.
The Times
A research from Halifax has showed that buyers will still pay a premium for rolling hills and woodland, as the cost of 
houses in rural areas is typically 21% higher than those in town, at an average price of £203,535; this gap has 
widened from 15% a year ago.

When Richard Branson called a Boeing executive in 1984 to see if he could buy a used 747 on decent terms, the 
entrepreneur expected his plans for a new airline to be greeted with scepticism.
Instead he found a sympathetic supplier. Start-ups such as Virgin Atlantic, explained the Boeing salesman, RJ 
Wilson, could weaken the grip of large and often state-run carriers. "The reason they carried on talking to me was 
because they needed a competitor to British Airways to have traction in selling - someone to give them a little 
leverage," remembers Mr Branson.
Mr Wilson could not have known then how dramatically commercial aviation would change over the following 25 
years. The biggest airlines, such as BA, would lose more than a little leverage to new entrants such as Virgin, 
Southwest Airlines and Ryanair, whose lower costs, rapid growth and cheap tickets would help democratise air 
travel and pull their larger peers into a seemingly endless loop of fare wars and service expansions.
Now the industry may be on the verge of another dramatic turn. By banding together, forming alliances and joint 
ventures, the old behemoths may have finally found a way to break the vicious cycle - at least on lucrative 
international routes.
Bilateral "Open Skies" treaties have eased access to many international hub airports. Politicians, motivated in part 
by concerns that voters would miss out on the choice in destinations and service offered by a rapidly evolving 
industry, have freed carriers to collaborate with international allies in ways that have made many antitrust lawyers 
nervous.
The friendlier regulatory climate has come as many airlines endure the most difficult decade in their history. 
Terrorist attacks, record fuel costs, bitter labour negotiations, bankruptcy filings and two deep recessions have 
tested more than the resolve of those in the sector.
"In the final analysis, joint ventures and alliances may be the way out for the legacy airlines," says Vaughn Cordle, 
chief analyst at AirlineForecasts.
Alliances have continued to gain strength in recent years. Following successful efforts to secure immunity from US 
antitrust law, two of the big global alliances, Star and SkyTeam, are now in the process of intensifying the co-
Ties in the skies
operation between the most powerful members of their respective groupings. This includes unifying fares and sales 
efforts to lucrative corporate clients. Meanwhile, a third big alliance, OneWorld, led by BA and American Airlines, is 
eagerly awaiting word on its immunity application, which it hopes will clear the way for its own transatlantic joint 
venture.
Such ambitious plans have not gone unnoticed. Regulators, politicians, labour leaders and, not least, independent 
competitors, all worry that the big network carriers are about to seize back the skies one transcontinental route at a 
time. In time, they warn, it will be passengers who pay for the legacy airlines' regained dominance.
For an industry beset by cut-throat competition, volatile commodity prices and one of the worst downturns in 
demand in history, the savings made possible by international partnerships hold the promise of stable profits - a 
goal as elusive to many airlines as comfortable economy class seats.
Few analysts doubt these partnerships will continue to flourish; many big airlines have persuaded US regulators to 
grant them antitrust immunity, freeing them to co-ordinate in ways that would have been otherwise impossible given 
the restrictions many countries impose on foreign investment in local airlines.
Through these ventures, airlines such as Air France-KLM co-operate on schedules and fares, co-ordinate sales 
pitches to corporate accounts and consolidate marketing offices and terminal gates. The next step would be joint 
purchasing agreements, generating volume discounts on everything from plastic cups to jet fuel - and maybe even 
multi-million dollar aircraft.
"It's no secret that this industry has failed to earn a reasonable profit over time," says Tom Horton, American 
Airlines' chief financial officer. "One of the structural problems has been extreme fragmentation . . . Alliances are a 
step in the direction of rationalising the industry."
It is little wonder executives at many large carriers regard partnerships as a salvation. And why their unallied peers 
such as Virgin and Emirates argue they will come to dominate the skies, crushing competition.
"If I were chairman of BA or American I would try to get away with it, try to dominate," Mr Branson says. "But that is 
what you have governments for, and that's what you have regulators for."
The upstarts have allies of their own, in Washington and Brussels. A bill now going through Congress could rescind 
US antitrust immunity deals. US Justice department officials have pushed their peers in the transport agency to limit 
the ventures' scope. In Brussels the European Commission is investigating the effects of partnerships on 
competition.
Critics argue that these ventures could undo much of the progress that has been made in the past 30 years towards 
making air travel more affordable. According to the Air Transport Association, a US lobby group, the price of flying 
each mile internationally since 1978, when the US industry was deregulated, has risen just 81 per cent - a far lower 
increase than the rise in cost of many consumer goods.
There are signs the trend has begun to reverse, at least on routes shared by venture partners. From 1999 to 2004, 
air fares in transatlantic markets dominated by the immunised alliances increased significantly compared with other 
international routes, according to the Brattle Group, a research firm.
There are also fears that alliances will eventually impact on domestic markets. US antitrust regulators worry that 
two local allies within the same international venture may find co-ordinating on domestic routes too tempting to 
avoid. Trade unions meanwhile fear airlines will use alliance membership to staff their fleets with pilots and flight 
attendants from countries with lower wages.
Airlines usually defend their alliances and ventures with a simple mantra: a healthy airline is good for employees, 
shareholders and passengers; stable profit growth lowers the cost of capital, which in turn helps keep fares low.
Ties in the skies
Yet for all their potential benefits, many industry insiders say these ventures fall short of the savings they would 
reap if governments allowed cross-border mergers. At best, alliances and cross-border ventures can help carriers to 
fill empty seats while they bide their time for changes to foreign-investment laws.
"Alliances are much more about the revenue side," says Mark Streeter of JPMorgan Chase. "If you want to 
rationalise costs, you merge."
In a world with no regulatory barriers, he says, BA and American Airlines "would love to explore a merger instead of 
having alliances".
Alliances and ventures currently also lack a means of guaranteeing that vendors will be paid, or a way to back 
those obligations with real assets - restricting their collective business operations and thus their overall purchasing 
power. "Let's say I'm Russia and I want to sell jet fuel to the Star Alliance," says Vicki Bryan of Gimme Credit, a 
debt research firm.
"Who do I go after if Star doesn't meet its obligation?" Alliances "are big franchises that don't own any stores", she 
adds.
Mindful that merger restrictions may still be in place for another decade or two, executives believe their ventures will 
continue to evolve in ways their predecessors would have never thought possible.
Star's immunised venture is seeking ways to harmonise technology processes, from reservations to baggage 
handling, while also cutting costs through the joint purchase of in-flight entertainment systems, catering services 
and fuel.
In what Glenn Tilton, United's chief executive, describes as the "next iteration of the discussion", Star is also 
exploring forming a special-purpose entity to help the venture build a capital structure of its own. Backed by 
members, this vehicle could open up even more possibilities for volume discounts.
The ability for airlines to forge closer ties with partners has only come after hard-fought battles to secure immunity 
from antitrust rules. SkyTeam's Air France, Czech Airlines and Delta Air Lines won such immunity in 2002. Star's 
Lufthansa and United formed an immunised joint venture in 2003. They will add five others, including Continental 
Airlines, this year.
BA and American Airlines sought immunity to form a venture of their own in 1997 and 2001, only to ditch both 
efforts once they deemed the cost - regulators' insistence that they surrender take-off and landing slots at London's 
Heathrow Airport - too great. The carriers applied a third time last year and expect a decision by the end of October.
Each venture could continue to add members as governments agree to liberalise routes to and from their 
international hubs. Partners are also inching their way towards a situation where one carrier generates as much 
revenue from selling a seat on an ally's flight as they do their own. It is an easier goal to achieve when each partner 
has complementary route networks.
"You want to stop worrying about which carrier a customer is on and say, 'how do we get more business in total?' " 
says Larry Kellner, Continental's chief executive.
For those carriers left outside the various ventures and alliances, the future looks more uncertain, leading to 
questions as to whether they can continue to go it alone or accept the need to join an alliance themselves.
"If they do succeed," says Mr Branson with reference to his arch-rivals BA and American. "I suspect we're going to 
need a big brother."
Northwest-KLM joint venture
'Their model is what we're trying to achieve - they were pioneers'
Ties in the skies
The 1989 leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines, a troubled US carrier, would lay the framework for a new era in 
international air travel.
Twenty years after the buy-out, the joint venture that the Minnesota-based company eventually formed with one of 
its investors - the Dutch airline, KLM - remains the "template" against which all other airline partnerships are 
measured, says Tom Horton, chief financial officer at rival American Airlines.
"Their model is what we're trying to achieve over the next 18-24 months," says Glen Hauenstein, an executive vice-
president at Delta, now the world's largest airline and a venture partner with Air France-KLM. "Northwest and KLM 
were the pioneers."
Yet the two airlines were not always viewed that way.
By the late 1980s KLM had grander ambitions than its limited domestic travel market could meet, and it soon sought 
ways to work in partnership with its newfound American investment.
Northwest was an also-ran airline, too. The carrier's hub cities in Minneapolis and Detroit were less than ideal for 
international routes, especially when compared to the coastal strongholds of peers such as American and United 
Airlines.
But in 1993, the US reached a landmark Open Skies accord with the Netherlands, removing restrictions that had 
limited their airlines' access to each other's airports. KLM and Northwest sought immunity from US antitrust laws, 
and by 1997 had formalised a joint venture.
The two airlines would soon come as close to operating one transatlantic network as possible without actually 
merging. They shared revenue on routes, merged sales forces, honoured one another's frequent-flyer miles, co-
ordinated fares and standardised business-class seats.
By the time Northwest was sold to Delta last year, the venture had created $4bn in additional revenue and 
established the carriers' most profitable routes - such as Amsterdam to Minneapolis - according to a former 
Northwest executive.
Their success has inspired many imitators.
"When you look at something, and say, 'Hey, this is working,' it spurs competition," says Larry Kellner, Continental's 
chief executive. "It says, 'Hey, we better get on board.' You see everyone else look at the model."

Thumbs up for the tin triangle
The world's only flying Avro Vulcan has been cleared to complete the remainder of its 2009 display season, which 
ends this month. Following a landing gear inspection, the UK's Vulcan to the Sky Trust has secured an extension to 
the approved number of cycles for its restored Cold War V-bomber XH558.
The Vulcan has been seen at air shows throughout the UK this summer, with recent appearances being made at 
RAF Lyneham, Blackpool, Shoreham, Bournemouth (which also saw it fly a sweep over the Needles on the Isle of 
Wight) and Dawlish, where it hooked up with the Red Arrows. The tin triangle's last display of this season is 
scheduled for Southport, Merseyside on 27 September.
Project director Dr Robert Pleming says a complete overhaul of the aircraft's port landing gear is planned during the 
winter months, with this to effectively re-life the equipment. "We foresee no other issues on this matter," he says.
XH558 will also undergo a minor service late this year, with the trust aiming to have its next permit to fly in hand 
around May 2010, before the next display season starts.

guarantee after September 2010. Goodbody have been saying for some time that the two main banks, even after 
raising some capital towards year end will still be relatively undercapitalised and over-leveraged relative to 
international norms and would not be unable to "stand on their own two feet" by September 2010. "So it appears, as 
many anticipated, that the guarantee will be extended. However, the Minister has indicated that it won't be a 
universal guarantee and 'will have to become targeted'". Secondly, Mr Lenihan indicated that "we are walking on

and Lisbon votes, there are many challenges ahead, with the Taoiseach recognising on Friday we have a crucial 
100 days ahead. However, progress on these points could keep any ratings downgrades at bay. However, most 
importantly, the Minister continues to hammer on about capital in the banks and potential ownership levels. Mr 
Lenihan first indicated that majority stakes in banks is "not a problem". He also indicated that the banks haven't 
been able to attract private investment and that he "can't wait forever". "He has been using this language for the last

reflect the lower selling prices, this was already fully factored into profit forecasts. One of the outstanding features of 
the interim results was the fact that organic volume growth across the board in the nutritionals operations (pre-

## A Post is to seek 1,000 voluntary redundancies among staff over the next three years following a dramatic 
downturn in business. Sources have revealed that the state postal service will outline to unions in the coming days 
that it has no choice but to enforce compulsory redundancies if it does not get the necessary applicants. It follows 
plummeting mail volumes, which are down by 12pc, and the loss of a 3m euro contract from British retailer 
Littlewoods to a private operator. Sources revealed that the company would tell the An Post Group of Unions next 
week it will impose job cuts if it does not get enough volunteers. - Irish Independent
## Jameson Whiskey was one of the few premium brands that delivered growth for its multinational owner, Pernod 
Ricard, during the 12 months to June 30th. The French-based drinks group said yesterday that sales of the Irish 
spirit grew 8 pc during the period, with volumes increasing to 24.3 million litres from 23.4 million litres, a 2 pc jump. 
The company said this translated into organic sales growth of 8 per cent, although it did not give a financial 
breakdown of these figures. - Irish Times
## Ulster Bank has received 1.1bn euro in capital injections this year from its UK parent, Royal Bank of Scotland 
(RBS), as the country's third-largest lender seeks to shore up its capital reserves against mounting bad loan losses. 
RBS pumped 280m euro into Ulster Bank on July 31, following on from a 300m euro capital boost at the end of 
June. But it has also emerged that the group, 70pc-owned by the UK taxpayer, poured 500m euro into the Irish 
bank in February. Last month, the all-island lender posted a £500m loss for the first half of the year, after writing off 
£641m of impaired loans. - Irish Independent ## Lifeline Ambulance Service has bought UK-based Evolved Medical 
Ambulance Services for 1m euro. Lifeline is Ireland's largest private ambulance operator and the deal to buy the 
Bristol-based firm is the first move in their planned expansion into the UK's private ambulance market which is 
worth about 500m euro. Lifeline Ambulance Services employs 108 full and part-time staff. It is headquartered in

A rebound in banking shares helped push the ISEQ back over the 3,000 mark again amid a rally on the European 
market and after a volatile week on the Dublin market.
The ISEQ rose by 60.28 points to 3,038.21.
Despite the recent improvement across a number of indicators of economic activity, we have seen reluctance by 
central bankers to get overly excited just yet, Goodbody Stockbrokers noted. Yesterday it was the turn of the ECB 
to voice their opinion on matters at their monthly rate setting meeting. While acknowledging the signs of stabilisation 
that have emerged in the Eurozone economy, prudence and caution were the buzzwords of the day.
US stocks inched higher following data that showed US employers cut fewer-than-expected jobs in August even as 
the unemployment rate hit a 26-year high. The Labour Department said the unemployment rate rose to 9.7pc, 
though the decline in payrolls was the smallest in a year at 216,000. Analysts in a poll had forecast 225,000 job 
cuts. Wall Street is focused on unemployment as the biggest weight on the still to be proven recovery. However, Mr 
Trichet's comments helped to lift European shares high amid renewed confidence that the end of the downturn is at 
least on the horizon. Back in Dublin, bank shares rose sharply with AIB gaining 9c to E2.42, Bank of Ireland rose by 
9c to E2.39 but Irish Life and Permanent fell by 10c to E4.80 as investors took profits. On the downside, shares in 
Elan managed to close unchanged at E5.15 after initial losses after a US judge ruled that it had breached an 
agreement it had with Biogen, its partner in the multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri. Under the deal, each has the 
right to take full control in the event of a change of control at either company. Ryanair released August traffic figures 
during the week. It had a 19pc rise in passengers to 6.88m, following an 18.9pc rise in July and a 13pc increase in 
June. Growth in passengers was exactly in line with growth in seat capacity for the second month running, leading 
to load factors remaining the same as last year at 90pc for August and 89pc for July. Ryanair's rolling 12 month 
load factor has been 82pc for all but two months this calendar year (in January and March), showing how it keeps

load factors (adjusted for seasonality) relatively constant, with pricing being the key driver in achieving load factor 
targets. Its shares rose by 1c to E3.15. Shares in Merrion Pharmaceuticals jumped by 10 at E3.75 after it reported a 
net loss of E2.3m for the first half of this year, compared with a loss of almost E2.2m a year earlier. Revenue 
surged from E350,000 to almost E1.7m, but the company spent more on research and development, while day-to-

Baggage charges for checked-in luggage will rise at Ryanair from October as the no-frills airline seeks to encourage 
people to take only carry-on bags and to raise revenue after cutting fares.
Booking one bag will cost E15 if done at time of booking over the Internet and will cost E30 to check in at the 
airport.
A second checked-in bag will cost E35 for the two or E70 at the airport.
Both pieces of checked in luggage will each carry a 15kg allowance. "Ryanair is also increasing its checked in 
baggage and excess baggage fees for travel from 1st October as part of the airlines programme to encourage 
passengers to travel with carry on luggage only. All passengers can avoid these optional checked in baggage fees 
by travelling with carry on baggage only," it said. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair continues to reduce 
air fares - saving our passengers over E530m this year alone. In order to persuade passengers to travel with carry 
on bags only and to defray the cost of some of these fare reductions we are increasing baggage allowances and 
fees with effect from 1st October. These baggage fees are all avoidable by all passengers who choose to travel with 
carry on luggage only. Over 70pc of Ryanair passengers will be totally unaffected by these changes as they already 
travel with just one carry on bag, which is free of charge."

(RTTNews) - With traders reacting positively to the latest monthly employment report, stocks showed a strong 
upward move over the course of the trading day on Friday. The major averages all ended the day firmly in positive 
territory after showing a lack of direction early on in the session.
The strength in the markets came after a report from the Labor Department showed a continued slowdown in the 
pace of job losses in August, although the report also showed that the unemployment rate jumped to a new twenty-
six year high.
Airline stocks turned in some of the market's best performances, resulting in a 2.9 percent gain by the NYSE Arca 
Airline Index. Ryanair (RYAAY) helped to lead the sector higher, ending the session up 6 percent.
Most of the other major sectors also moved higher over the course of the session, reflecting broad based buying 
interest. Significant strength was visible among semiconductor, railroad, electronic storage, and healthcare provider 
stocks.
The major averages moved to the upside going into the close, ending the session just off their best levels of the 
day. The Dow closed up 96.66 at 9,441.27, the Nasdaq closed up 35.58 at 2,018.78 and the S&P 500 closed up 
13.16 at 1,016.40.
While the major averages closed higher for a second straight day, they were unable to completely offset the losses 
seen earlier in the week. Subsequently, the Dow and the S&P 500 posted weekly losses of 1.1 percent and 1.2 
percent, respectively, and the Nasdaq showed a 0.5 percent decline.

BA passenger data show drift from premium to economy class
BA passenger data show drift from premium to economy class

Body
The drift away from premium to economy class air travel has been reconfirmed by British Airways, which has 
registered another month of falling sales from first- and business-class passengers.
The airline saw premium-class traffic in August fall by 11.9 per cent year-on- year although "non-premium" 
economy-class custom edged up 1.3 per cent.
Total passengers carried during the busy month dipped 1.7 per cent year-on- year to 3.16m.
Passenger traffic on Asia-Pacific routes was down 13 per cent but there was a small increase on routes to the 
Americas. Passengers carried on short-to-medium-haul routes in the UK and Europe fell 2 per cent.
The monthly breakdown confirmed trends established this year as BA continued to grapple with a downturn in 
demand among business travellers.
The airline is also battling against competition from no-frills budget airlines on its less lucrative short-haul routes in 
Europe.
BA, which last month closed a £350m issue of convertible bonds to strengthen its balance sheet, saw some 
recovery in demand for cargo services, with cargo load kilometres down 5.4 per cent against a year-to-date decline 
of 9.2 per cent. The overall load factor on flights was 75.9 per cent, up from 75.1 per cent in July.
BA's figures came as rival Ryanair announced it had carried 6.88m passengers across its low-cost network of 
European routes in August.
The expansion in passengers carried, up 19 per cent on August last year, was achieved as Ryanair maintained its 
load factor for the month at 90 per cent year on year.
BA passenger data show drift from premium to economy class
Shares in BA closed up 2½p at 184p, while those in Ryanair finished 6.6 cents higher yesterday at EUR3.13.    
EasyJet is considering plans to close its East Midlands base and reduce its flying schedule at Luton by 20 per cent, 
placing as many as 230 jobs at risk, in order to redeploy assets to growth markets.
In July, Easyjet said that it would be one of the few airlines to remain profitable in the current year, although 
earnings would drop sharply, and reiterated its desire to build on that success by increasing capacity by 7.5 per 
cent a year over the medium term.
The low-cost airline has waged a long battle with Abertis, the Spanish operator of Luton, and Luton borough 
council, which owns the airport, over charges that it claims have risen 25 per cent in the past three years and are 
unsustainable.
Talks over the charges broke down in the past few weeks, prompting EasyJet's management to look for ways to cut 
costs ahead of the winter months.
Luton borough council declined to comment but said it had done all it could "to work with EasyJet and other airlines 
to retain and grow their operations during this difficult time brought about by the worldwide recession".
EasyJet also released statistics showing passenger numbers rose 4.7 per cent year-on-year in August and load 
factors from 91.3 per cent to 91.8 per cent. EasyJet shares closed up 0.3p at 315.8p.

The Dublin shares market shrugged off losses on Wall Street overnight and flat trading in Europe this morning with 
AIB and Bank of Ireland recouping some of their losses from earlier this week and boosting the index.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 29.01 points to break through the 3,000 level again at 3,004.00.
Shares in AIB jumped 5c to E2.45, Bank of Ireland gained 10c to E2.38 and Irish Life and Permanent climbed 6c to 
E4.96.
The two most timely data releases on the Irish economy, the Live Register and Exchequer Returns, both released 
yesterday, provide slightly more encouraging signs on the current state of the Irish economy than have been seen 
up to now. Meanwhile, euro zone services economy jumped back almost to recovery in August, and is on course to 
grow in the current quarter led by a resurgent Germany and France, key data showed today. The data should 
reassure the European Central Bank as it meets that the worst of a severe recession is over even though a return 
to economic growth may be slow while unemployment remains high. It is widely expected to leave rates on hold at a 
record low of 1.0 percent later in the day. Blackrock International Land has reported interim results to the end of 
June 2009 (September 3rd), showing only a 2.5pc decline in the NAV per share to 25c since the end of 2008. The 
company has decided not to seek independent valuations of its portfolio for the interim statements due to the 
absence of reliable market evidence. Its view is that the few market transactions that have taken place have been at 
prices that do not appear to reflect 'fair value'. As such, the decline in the NAV principally reflects losses due to 
exchange rate movements and equity accounted investments. Shares in the property group rose by 1c to E0.08. 
Despite having announced a new oil find in the Gulf of Mexico, which equates to the size of the annual Saudi 
production, the CEO of Boeing told reporters that he sees a return to USD100 a barrel oil. Shares in Ryanair gained 
4c to E3.10. Aer Lingus stocks were flat at E0.52.

The Dublin shares market sank deeper in to the red in volatile trading following a report from Bloxham's setting out 
the devastation wrecked on the Irish financial sector by the crisis and concluding that NAMA is the only game in

Shares in AIB slumped 5c to E2.35, Bank of Ireland gained 8c to E2.36 and Irish Life and Permanent stayed flat at 
E4.90.
Full nationalisation of Ireland's banks is just too risky and will cost the taxpayer far more than NAMA, which is the 
only current plan that can succeed, a major report on NAMA from Bloxham Stockbrokers said today. It said the size 
of the Irish banking sector loan book to GDP is far greater than in previous well referenced banking crises such as 
those in Finland, Sweden and Japan. "Therefore the potential cost of a nationalisation of the Irish banks is far 
greater to Ireland's debt raising ability than in previous cases." It concluded that the Irish economy is suffering from 
a starvation of liquidity. According to the Bank of International Settlements, international cross border lending is 
collapsing. Foreign owned banks in Ireland, which contribute a third of the total Irish lending book, are operating at 
loan/deposit levels far in excess of optimum levels. Blackrock International Land has reported interim results to the

reported that despite a 7pc fall in volumes so far in 2009, "there has been a substantial improvement in EBITDA". 
While not quantifying how much this was, it noted the main contributory factors to this margin improvement were 
price increases; improved gross margins; and, reduced marketing costs, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers. C

Irish shares bounced back this morning from their losses of yesterday as optimism crept back into European 
markets.
A round of good PMI results across the continent this morning has calmed yesterday's worries that markets are 
getting ahead of the recovery.
The ISEQ index of Irish shares was up 16.09 points a short time ago at 2,991.08.
Across Europe, the CAC-40 in Paris was up 5 points at 3,978, while the Dax in Frankfurt had gained 7 points to 
5,326. Caution among investors continued to limit gains, as markets awaited comments from ECB president Je3an 
Claude Trichet at the press conference he is due to give after today's meeting of the bank's council. He is expected 
to warn that the recession in the eurozone is far from over. In Dublin this morning, CRH was ahead by 20c to 1716, 
with Ryanair up 3c to 309 and DCC ahead by 4c to 1608. Among the banks, Irish Life and Permanent was 10c 
higher at 497, with Bank of Ireland up 1c to 229. AIB was 9c lower, however, at 231.

Low cost airline SkyEurope goes bankrupt

SkyEurope Airline AS, a Central European discount airline, said Tuesday it has filed for bankruptcy and that all its 
flights, sales and operations have been suspended.
The company cited the "lack of sufficient interim funding to finance ongoing operations."
Trading in the company's stock was suspended as the Vienna Stock Exchange opened Tuesday, it said.
Around the world, many airlines have been on the defensive for two years, cutting flights and firing workers first to 
absorb rising fuel prices, then to ride out recession. Some have been forced into bankruptcy.
The troubled SkyEurope obtained credit protection in Slovakia in June. It reported a loss of close to &#8264;lion 
($85.63 million) in the 2007-2008 business year, with a turnover of &#8264;million ($372.36 million).
SkyEurope was founded in 2001 and began operations in February 2002. It has not been profitable since. It 
operated services to more than 20 European cities from bases in Bratislava, Vienna and Prague.
Vienna international airport stopped servicing departing SkyEurope flights in the mid-August because the airline 
failed to meet a deadline for paying outstanding debts and it was forced to operate those flights from nearby 
Bratislava.
Prague's airport announced it would not service SkyEurope flights starting Tuesday, if it fails to pay its debts.
SkyEurope spokesman Tomas Kika was not immediately available for comment.
Last month, the Web site of the Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes reported the company had asked employees to 
accept being paid only a week of their July wages with the rest to be paid out in 15 days and warned that it would 
be forced to stop operations if the majority turned down the request. The employees reportedly agreed.
The airline advised passengers who paid for flights with a credit card to seek refunds at their credit card issuing 
banks. It said passengers have to purchase return flights from other airlines.
A number of airlines have offered stranded passengers various "rescue fares."
Low cost airline SkyEurope goes bankrupt
Ryanair, Europe's major budget airline, has offered one-way tickets for SkyEurope passengers from Bratislava to 
four destinations in Europe, including a one-way trip for &#8264;8).
"SkyEurope's failure underlines the risk of flying with an airline that is not financially stable," said Ryanair 
spokesman Stephen McNamara.
Others include an offer from Czech Airlines CSA to fly to 20 European destinations for &#8264;2) one-way.
Several hundred passengers were stranded at two Croatian airports that SkyEurope was flying to Zadar and 
Dubrovnik.
The head of Dubrovnik airport, Tonci Peovic, said it "expects the embassies" of Slovakia, Austria and the Czech 
Republic the destinations of Tuesday's and Wednesday's flights "to find a solution" for the passengers.

The Dublin shares market was hit with a case of the jitters over the implications of the impending NAMA legislation 
on banks with AIB and Bank of Ireland shares plunging in morning trade.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 42.62 points to 3,053.54.
Brian Lenihan yesterday said that the Government had all but ruled out full nationalisation of AIB or Bank of Ireland 
and it was unlikely that the value of their shares would be wiped out entirely as part of the NAMA process. However, 
he did say that the State could end up owning large stakes - even majority shareholdings - in the two banks. The 
Minister stated that nationalisation would hurt the Irish credit rating, that taking majority stakes in the banks would 
be done if needed and that the state would pay 1.5pc on the NAMA bonds given to the banks. The Minister also 
revealed that AIB and Bank of Ireland were not insolvent. He also stated that there was consideration being given 
the to the payment delay feature of the recent proposals; this would effectively reduce the amount of the bond 
payments made to the banks in exchange for the "bad loans" until a certain level of recoverability could be 
identified.
Shares in AIB plunged by 17c to E2.50 and Bank of Ireland lost 20c to E2.30. Irish Life and Permanent, which will 
have no dealings with NAMA, saw its share price rise 25c to E5.00. It was announced overnight that CRH is to join 
the Dow Jones EURO STOXX 50 Index. Along with Anheuser-Busch Inbev, they replace Fortis and Renault. The 
changes will be implemented on September 18 and be effective on September 21. Shares in CRH edged down 2c 
to E17.88. Its being coming for a while, but German airline, SkyEurope filed for bankruptcy yesterday evening and 
all flights have been suspended by the airline due to a "lack of sufficient interim funding to finance ongoing 
operations". This move, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers, highlights the difficult operating environment in the 
airline industry and "presumably this winter more airlines are likely to follow SkyEurope to the great white cloud in 
the sky". The demise of SkyEurope removes a competitor in the CEE region for the mainstream airlines, including

Mueller begins work today as the new chief executive at Aer Lingus. He will preside over a major new cost-cutting 
plan due to be unveiled in the coming months that could see major job cuts and pay reductions. The 47-year-old

Wizz Air flies into SkyEurope's market share

Highlight: SkyEurope's collapse speeds Wizz Air's entry into Czech Republic market
Body
Wizz Air, the Hungarian budget airline, said expanding into the Czech Republic market was a natural step, but 
SkyEurope's collapse sped the company's expansion.
&
Slovakian-based SkyEurope filed for bankruptcy on September 1. Low cost airline rivals like Wizz Air, easyJet and 
Ryanair immediately began offering stranded passengers rescue packages, mainly one-way flights from European 
countries such as Slovakia, Austria and Czech Republic, as well as the UK, to their home countries for (EURO)20 
to (EURO)30.
&
SkyEurope's collapse did not come as a surprise to Wizz Air. The Hungarian competitor launched routes to the 
Czech Republic in February and opened a base there in June.
&
"We had the experience of competing with SkyEurope on markets such as Hungary, Poland and very recently in the 
Czech Republic," said a spokesperson for Wizz Air. "However, the timing of the February launch was due to the fact 
that we saw the weakening of SkyEurope on that particular market."&
&
After SkyEurope filed for bankruptcy, Wizz Air launched a three-phase plan, which included offering the rescue 
packages, adding 11 weekly frequencies to the existing 45 flights in Prague as well as adding a third aircraft in 
Prague beginning next spring.
&
However, according to the airline yields are unlikely to change dramatically. "[We] don't expect a big change as the 
competitiveness of the market remains and the attitude towards travel largely depends on the economic situation," 
said the spokesperson.
&
Wizz Air flies into SkyEurope's market share
In contrast, Ryanair, which offered rescue packages for (EURO)30, said they would not consider any expansions or 
frequency increases in that market until they could negotiate cost reductions with airports. Stephen McNamara, 
head of Ryanair communications, said the routes left by SkyEurope were "not desirable routes".&
McNamara added that the reason SkyEurope went under was because it was using a low-cost model at high-cost 
airports. "In some cases the airports get caught up with passenger numbers. They have an inflated opinion of 
themselves and now they have one less customer."&&&&

The ISEQ index of Irish shares was down 46.84 points a short time ago at 3,049.32.
The two main banks were hit by yesterday's warning from the European Central Bank that NAMA should take care 
not to pay too much for loans.
AIB was down 4c this morning to 263, with Bank of Ireland off by 1c to 249. Irish Life and Permanent, which will not 
be involved in the NAMA exercise, was up 25c to 500. CRH was up 18c to 1808, with Elan ahead by 5c to 510 and 
Ryanair also up 5c to 317.

The Unite trade union has urged Irish workers to reject the European Union's Lisbon reform treaty in October's 
referendum, saying the pact would leave them exposed to pay cuts, job losses and unfair treatment.
Last year Ireland rejected the treaty designed to streamline EU decision-making, but will vote again on Oct. 2 after 
winning concessions on key Irish policy areas including military neutrality and retaining an EU commissioner.
Unite, which ranks itself the biggest union in Britain and Ireland's second, lent its premises earlier this month for the 
launch of the "Vote No to Lisbon" campaign led by the Socialist Party and nationalist Sinn Fein but it was not then 
formally listed as a member.
But this morning Unite has issued a statement urging its 60,000 members in the Republic of Ireland and other trade 
union members to vote "No" on Oct. 2, saying the additional guarantees Ireland had received on workers' rights 
were unsatisfactory. "Irish workers are alone in Europe as the only ones whose right to fair pay and employment 
security are considered by their government as obstacles to economic recovery," Unite Irish Regional Secretary 
Jimmy Kelly said, adding that backing the Lisbon treaty would "enshrine" Irish workers' problems. The latest opinion 
polls show a majority now plan to vote "Yes" -- many convinced by the need for EU support in Ireland's worst 
downturn on record -- but last year's late swing to a 'No' majority shows opinion could still go the other way. 
Companies worried about the fate of the Irish economy such as chipmaker Intel and budget airline Ryanair have 
been at the forefront of the "Yes" campaign, but opponents have also focused on the economy. "We earned the 
right to go back to the EU and to clarify and secure elements of the workings of the Union that are essential to get 
right," Unite said.

The Nama debate may overshadow crucial Lisbon vote
The Nama debate may overshadow crucial Lisbon vote

Section: COMMENT AND ANALYSIS
Length: 935 words

Backroom wonders if he is alone in thinking that the debate on Nama is crowding out the more important issue 
facing the Irish people - the Lisbon Treaty vote on October 2.
To have a major issue such as Nama as a source of interparty point scoring and rivalry in advance of the most 
important referendum we have faced since 1983 is unfortunate, to say the least. For that debate to threaten the 
possible survival of a government compounds the problem further.
Backroom doesn't pretend to understand the full complexities of the Nama issue, although he confesses to being 
concerned that there appear to be 250 economists employed by the state. If this came up in An Bord Snip, then 
Backroom must have missed it.
Nevertheless, the debate appeared to become particularly alarmist last week, with the temperature raised further by 
a combination of 40 or so economists and Fine Gael.
The fear Backroom has is that the focus of the debate seems to be about retribution for developers and their ilk 
rather than where Ireland will be in the future.
The bottom line is that there appear to be pluses and minuses to all the party plans.
Fine Gael's good bank seems like a great idea until you wonder what we should do with our old banks. Defaulting 
on bondholders or asking them to share the pain with the taxpayer (depending on your perspective) seems 
reasonable, until you consider we depend on these people for the price of next year's spending.
Backroom is not convinced that this strategy is consistent with our long-term needs. Labour's temporary 
nationalisation scheme seems weak on the cost to the state of the debt write-off, although the simplicity of the 
solution compared to Nama has its attractions.
The Nama debate may overshadow crucial Lisbon vote
The problem, however, is that the bad debt problem is the horse that has already bolted. If you take the book value 
of the loans at  90 billion and the worst case retrieval scenario envisaged by the economists at  30 billion, then it 
seems the maximum risk associated with Nama is about  60 billion.
Undoubtedly it's a lot of money, but the worst case scenario will hardly apply. Much of the debt is in Britain, where 
prices have been already rising slowly. If there is not some midterm recovery of prices in a more benign general 
climate, then we are all in trouble. Without Nama, or something very like it, we have little or no prospect of 
benefiting from any price recovery.
For a country that has already cleared one substantial debt in recent decades, additional debt of even  60 billion 
doesn't seem beyond a resourceful and educated people. Yes, it's awful, but we can either deal with it or drown in 
it.
Of more interest last week was the decision by Intel and Ryanair to back - with cold hard cash - the Yes vote in the 
Lisbon Treaty referendum.
Backroom doesn't know if this will be effective - and, in the case of Ryanair, the possibility of the move backfiring 
must be a real one - but it is indicative of how important business feels being at the heart of Europe actually is.
As a United States multinational, the Intel intervention is particularly significant. If the concerns expressed by Jim 
O'Hara represent any indication of discussions taking place elsewhere in US boardrooms, then we should be 
particularly worried.
If we are to succeed in getting ourselves out of our current predicament, even over ten or 15 years, then we have 
no alternative but to trade our way out of it. Despite some pessimistic soundings from the National Competitiveness 
Council, that is what we are beginning to do.
Being at the heart of Europe was a crucial element of our initial success and it is central to any future prosperity we 
will enjoy.
At a time when the green shoots appear to be emerging on the continent, there has been little discussion about how 
we intend to make the most of any recovery in the world's major economies.
The key issue facing the Yes side is seeking to explain the consequences of a No vote. This is not an easy task. 
The consequences of a No vote are not spelled out in the Lisbon Treaty document, so there is no point in looking 
there.
The old saying 'if something's worth doing, it's worth doing well' applies here. The No side will say our membership 
of the EU will not be voided by a No vote, but the Yes side has to spell out how Ireland is affected by a No vote.
Of course, we won't be thrown out of the EU, but what is the point of being in an organisation when you're viewed 
by your fellow members as having the plague?
The problem for the Yes side is that the people to whom we should be looking to show leadership are doing the 
opposite.
Backroom is not suggesting that the opposition, for example, should not voice its concerns on Nama, but it should 
at least take place alongside some common play on how important Lisbon is to all of us.
The summer has come and gone, yet there is no discernible campaign momentum being developed on the Yes 
side.
Rather than returning from his summer break refreshed and eager to make good on his promise to show leadership 
on the Lisbon issue, Enda Kenny has chosen to kick off his autumn on Nama alone.
The government's response has been to fall straight into the trap.
The Nama debate may overshadow crucial Lisbon vote
Nama is an important issue and should be treated as such, but it isn't being offered as a panacea to our problems.
There are risks to the taxpayers with all the plans being offered. Our past experience with debt has been to grow 
the economy so that the debt - Nama and otherwise - and its impact is minimised.
That is what we need to do again, and our membership of the European Union is critical to returning to the 
necessary growth to achieve that. That is what is at stake on October 2.

In recent months, we've all been asking where did all the money go. The same question could be put to the board 
of Aer Lingus. After its disastrous set of results for the first half of 2009 which saw it report an operating loss of  93 
million, shareholders may wonder also wonder about its balance sheet.
The business, which not so long ago had close to  1 billion on its books, has seen its cash reserves decline 
dramatically. At the end of June 2008, it had  802 million in cash.
That was reduced to  439 million by the end of June 2009, and the company expects that to fall to around  
300million by the end of this year.
It has bought new aircraft with some of the money and is in the process of deferring orders for more. Buying aircraft 
is one thing, but eating into reserves by slashing fares and not slashing costs, is simply not a sustainable business 
model. But as ever, nobody knows this better than Aer Lingus management. The trade unions see it differently, 
however.
Scare stories about Aer Lingus have been around for a long time, but this time round, Aer Lingus is a private 
company with a listing on the stock market. The initial cost-cutting, which began under Willie Walsh, was never 
really completed.
While there may be case for retaining an airline that is somewhere between Ryanair and Qantas in terms of 
customer experience, Aer Lingus must decide where it is in relation to its costs.
Colm Barrington, chairman of Aer Lingus, and his new chief executive will have a tough job on their hands.

From Mr Dermot Doyle.
Sir, I read with amusement Dragan Barbutovski's complaints about the airline industry (Letters, August 15). Surely it 
has occurred to him that if he wishes for premium treatment of "the times when flying was fun and exotic" then he's 
going to have to whip out his wallet and fly business class.
I for one am delighted with the availability of low-cost carriers across Europe, particularly Ryanair, as I travel to and 
from the continent on a bi-weekly basis for both business and personal reasons. My last batch of tickets (including 
connecting transport) cost less than EUR300 for four return flights, as opposed to EUR350 for one return flight from 
one flag carrier. In such cash-strapped times as these, I'm thrilled to be able get such cheap flights. They keep both 
my business and personal relationships going.
Surely Mr Barbutovski can see that the reasons for the big financial losses in the airline industry, which he himself 
noted, are due to the fact that the flying public simply don't want to pay for a veneer of fun and a touch of the exotic 
on what is essentially a bus with wings? They are voting with their wallet. Mr Barbutovski should do so too.

Interim pre-tax loss widens to EUR82m
Long-haul travel in steep decline
Body
Losses at Aer Lingus, the former state-owned Irish carrier, increased in the first half as revenues fell because of 
cuts in fares, reduced seat sales and higher fuel costs.
The airline, which has fended off two hostile take- over bids from Ryanair, the rival Irish airline, saw pre-tax losses 
widen from EUR21.3m to EUR81.7m (£72m) in the six months to June 30. The 2008 half-year result included a 
EUR17.6m exceptional charge related to cost reductions.
Total turnover declined from EUR631.8m to EUR555.1m, with the 15.7 per cent fall in fares more than offsetting a 
20.5 per cent rise in ancillary earnings from booking fees and baggage charges. Short-haul passenger numbers 
increased 3.6 per cent to 4.4m but long-haul numbers declined 11.6 per cent to 528,000 as routes to Los Angeles 
and Dubai were discontinued.
With fewer bookings, the cash reserves position also deteriorated, falling EUR654m to EUR440m.
Commenting on the results, Colm Barrington, chairman, said: "While traffic volumes have stabilised, consumer 
confidence remains weak and we see no sign of an improvement in the near term."
He said the board "must now take difficult and necessary steps to address our business model and cost base so 
that we ensure Aer Lingus is viable over the long term".
  FT Comment 
Christoph Mueller will have a full in-tray as he starts as the new chief executive on Tuesday. Figures published 
yesterday by the International Air Transport Association underscore that it is not only Aer Lingus that is suffering 
from a decline in demand. Across the industry, the Geneva-based organisation said international passenger 
Aer Lingus faces up to 'difficult' way ahead
demand fell 2.9 per cent in July while freight demand was down 11.3 per cent. John Mattimoe, analyst with Merrion 
Stockbrokers, said given the decline in revenues, cost reduction was the only option for re-establishing profitability 
and that it would have to be "significant in scale". However, Mr Barrington admitted yesterday that it was not just the 
cost base but "the business model" that needed rethinking. Analysts see losses widening to EUR140m for the full 
year - a deterioration of EUR160m if the EUR140m of restructuring charges taken in 2008 is added back. Ryanair's 
January offer at EUR1.40 a share, which was rejected by the board and the government - a 25 per cent shareholder 
- now looks very generous. Ryanair had offered EUR2.80 just weeks after the initial public offering in 2006. The 
shares closed yesterday at 51 cents.

Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC said Thursday its net loss more than trebled in the first half of the year after it 
slashed fares to entice passengers amid the economic downturn, prompting talk the carrier may yet succumb to a 
takeover by rejected suitor Ryanair.
The carrier posted a net loss of &#8264;illion ($105.5 million) for the six months through June, down from 
&#8264;illion for the same period a year ago. Revenue fell 12 percent to &#8264;llion from &#8264;llion.
Chairman Colm Barrington said Aer Lingus would push ahead with a "wide-ranging" business review to return the 
airline to profitability.
"We must now take difficult but necessary steps to address our business model and cost base," Barrington said in a 
statement.
"While traffic volumes have stabilised, consumer confidence remains weak and we see no sign of any improvement 
in the near term," he added.
Average fare prices were 17 percent lower over the first half. Fuel costs rose 10 percent. The company also said it 
was impacted by the imposition of a &#8264;senger departure tax in Ireland.
The results put more pressure on incoming Chief Executive Officer Christoph Mueller, who takes over the top job at 
the start of next month.
Mueller, 47, for the past two years has been aviation director at Anglo-German travel group TUI Travel PLC, where 
he managed charter airlines with 160 aircraft and 11,000 employees.
Aer Lingus has twice rejected hostile bids from Ryanair, but chief financial officer Sean Coyle said Friday he had 
"no idea" if the airline would resist a third approach.
Ryanair Holdings PLC, which holds an almost 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus, did not make any immediate 
comment on a renewed offer, but repeated calls for regulators to investigate a December 2008 document issued by 
Aer Lingus posts first-half loss
Aer Lingus as a defense against takeover that said reduced fuel prices and cost reduction plans would "enhance 
profitability in 2009 and beyond."
Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary, who has accused Aer Lingus of misleading shareholders to 
protect its independent status, said Aer Lingus should be forced to explain the document to shareholders, who have 
watched the carrier's share price plunge in recent months.
Immediately after the Irish government offloaded 75 percent of Aer Lingus equity on to the Irish and British stock 
exchanges in September 2006, Ryanair began buying up its Irish competitor, a move that caught both Aer Lingus 
and the government off guard.
Its strategy is to buy out the government's pivotal 25 percent stake eventually. The government of Prime Minister 
Brian Cowen has repeatedly rejected the idea of a Ryanair-Aer Lingus merger, but it also is battling the worst 
budget deficit in Irish history, making it desperate for cash.

In one of the busiest weeks of the year for corporate results, the ISEQ rose by over 55 points with investors hopeful

By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 55.43 points to 3,072.47.
Aer Lingus, IFG, UTV and Datalex reported half year results today while C and C surprised with the announcement

Ireland up 19c to E2.56. Irish Life and Permanent fell by 9c to E3.97 amid profit taking from Wednesday's rise. The 
Government is considering various ways it might pay AIB, Bank of Ireland, and other lenders for the tens of billions 
of euros in loans they will transfer to a state-run "bad bank". The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) will 
take commercial property loans with a nominal value of E90 billion off the books of beleaguered banks in a bid to 
revive the financial system and economy. "Consideration is being given to a number of different approaches," a 
finance ministry spokesman said today. Under draft legislation, Ireland will pay the banks government bonds in 
return for the distressed loans. The banks will be able to cash the bonds with the European Central Bank providing 
them with badly-needed liquidity. Shares in Aer Lingus rose by 2c to E0.52 after its latest set of results came in with 
no surprises. It reported an operating loss of E93m for the first six months of the year. This compares to a loss of 
E23.4m the same time last year. Its revenue fell by 12.2pc to E555m. Its half yearly pre-tax losses increased to 
E81.7m from E21.3m the same time last year. Aer Lingus said it saw total passengers rising by 1.7pc to a total of 
4.943 million in the six months period. In the first half of the year, seven routes were cancelled while capacity was 
reduced on 24 routes. Ryanair shares gained 4c to E3.11. Shares in C and C jumped 27c to E2.50 after it said it is

regulatory consent and employee consultation. Shares in IFG rose by 10c to E1.43. IFG's interim results to the end

In one of the busiest weeks of the year for corporate results, the ISEQ rose by nearly 50 points with investors 
hopeful the worst of the impact of the downturn may be behind our top firms.
The ISEQ rose by 49.76 points to 3,066.80.
Aer Lingus, IFG, UTV and Datalex reported half year results yesterday while C and C surprised with the 
announcement of a new acquisition.
However, it was the banks that did most to life the ISEQ higher with AIB shares gaining 17c to E2.53 and Bank of 
Ireland up 18c to E2.55. Irish Life and Permanent fell by 9c to E3.97 amid profit taking from Wednesday's rise. The 
Government is considering various ways it might pay AIB, Bank of Ireland, and other lenders for the tens of billions 
of euros in loans they will transfer to a state-run "bad bank". The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) will 
take commercial property loans with a nominal value of E90 billion off the books of beleaguered banks in a bid to 
revive the financial system and economy. "Consideration is being given to a number of different approaches," a 
finance ministry spokesman said today. Under draft legislation, Ireland will pay the banks government bonds in 
return for the distressed loans. The banks will be able to cash the bonds with the European Central Bank providing 
them with badly-needed liquidity. Shares in Aer Lingus rose by 1c to E0.51 after its latest set of results came in with 
no surprises. It reported an operating loss of E93m for the first six months of the year. This compares to a loss of 
E23.4m the same time last year. Its revenue fell by 12.2pc to E555m. Its half yearly pre-tax losses increased to 
E81.7m from E21.3m the same time last year. Aer Lingus said it saw total passengers rising by 1.7pc to a total of 
4.943 million in the six months period. In the first half of the year, seven routes were cancelled while capacity was 
reduced on 24 routes. Ryanair shares gained 3c to E3.10. Shares in C and C jumped 36c to E2.59 after it said it is 
buying Anheuser Busch's operations in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland for E205m. The news sent its shares 
12pc higher in Dublin trade this morning. The main brand is Tennent's lager, but C and C will also secure the 
ISEQ powers ahead on latest results ISEQ Up
distribution rights for global brands like Stella and Beck's as well as Budweiser in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
The company said the deal will be financed from a combination of its own cash resources and existing bank 
facilities. It added that it expects the deal to be immediately earnings positive. It is subject to shareholder approval, 
regulatory consent and employee consultation. Shares in IFG rose by 12c to E1.45. IFG's interim results to the end 
of June comfortably beat analysts' expectations as a result of continued strength in the international business and 
UK pension trustee business and also due to a boost from a non-recurring E2m gain in the Irish division. UTV 
Media and Datalex shares remained unmoved at E0.69 and E0.24 respectively.

Body
Aer Lingus's first-half net loss more than tripled, the airline has revealed this morning.
It has also warned it is suffering strong downward pressure on fares and is facing a highly uncertain outlook with no 
sign of consumer confidence returning.
The results heap pressure on new chief executive Christoph Mueller, who takes over next week, to reverse the 
former state airline's losses and preserve its independence in the face of competition from former suitor Ryanair 
and dwindling cash reserves.
Aer Lingus said its loss after tax in the six months to the end of June had widened 242 percent to 73.9m euros on 
revenue down 12.2 percent at 555 million. Passenger numbers rose by 1.7pc during the period to 4.94m. The 
airline also cancelled seven routes and reduced capacity on 24 others. Average fares were down by 17.1pc during 
the period from a year earlier, 13.1pc on short haul routes and 18.5pc on long haul. Fuel costs were up by 10pc. 
"Aer Lingus expects that the continuation of the current market trends in Ireland and its other key markets will lead 
to further sustained and significant fare pressure," it said. "This dynamic and very challenging environment 
contributes to a highly uncertain outlook." Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget carrier and the holder of a 29 percent 
stake in Aer Lingus after two failed takeover bids, last month trimmed its own full-year profit forecast as it was 
forced to cut fares to fill aircraft. Aer Lingus' net cash position declined by almost 33 percent since the end of last 
year to 439.6 million euros. That appeared faster than the pace of cash burn signalled in March when management 
said net cash would remain above 400 million by the end of 2009. "This revenue environment, coupled with an 
uncompetitive cost base, means that we must now take difficult but necessary steps to address our business model 
and cost base so that we ensure Aer Lingus is viable over the long term," Chairman Colm Barrington said in a 
statement. A source close to the company told Reuters on Tuesday Aer Lingus was preparing a cost-cutting plan of 
up to 130 million euros for this autumn in order to protect its cash pile and become more efficient amid the industry 
downturn. (c) Reuters

Aer Lingus is preparing a cost-cutting plan to be launched this autumn in order to protect its cash pile and become 
more efficient amid the industry downturn, a source close to the company said.
New CEO Christian Mueller, who starts at the company next week, would identify ways to trim costs in both staff 
and non-staff areas before presenting the plan to trade unions, the source said.
Analysts believe the loss-making Aer Lingus needs to find E130 million to take out of the business, about 10 
percent of the cost base, the source noted.
Aer Lingus has been battered in recent months by falling passenger numbers and declining fares as well as 
competition from low-cost rival and two-time failed suitor Ryanair. "Very generally, any cost-cutting programme 
would have to be 10 percent of the cost base to be material. I'd be happy with that," said Stephen Furlong, airlines 
analyst at Davy stockbrokers in Dublin. The airline, nearly 30 percent owned by Ryanair and 25 percent by the Irish 
government, is expected to report a first-half loss on Thursday. The cost-cutting programme will follow two profit 
warnings and the resignation of the previous CEO this year as well as the postponement of new plane orders from 
Airbus. A spokeswoman for Aer Lingus declined to comment. A spokesman for airline workers union SIPTU said its 
staff representatives were expecting a cost-cutting programme but had yet to hear details. (C ) Reuters

BALPA: Ryanair 'intimidating' flightcrews over union link
Flightcrew representatives have accused Ryanair of a "massive campaign of threats and intimidation" to prevent its 
UK pilots from accepting union representation.
The outburst came in response to Ryanair jibes that the British Air Line Pilots Association had suspended union 
recognition attempts in the face of a "groundswell of opposition" from pilots.
BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan hit back, saying that Ryanair had threatened a UK base freeze, possible 
base closures, unpaid leave and redundancies if pilots pursue union recognition.
Ryanair deems these allegations "totally untrue". It points out that both unpaid leave and a UK base freeze were 
implemented months in advance of BALPA's campaign.
The carrier also says that "unlike 'BALPA' airlines" it expects no redundancies this winter, and denies threatening 
base closures.
The spat began in July, when Ryanair rejected a request from BALPA for voluntary recognition. The pilots' union 
can now choose to ask the independent Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) to supervise a secret ballot among 
Ryanair pilots.
Were BALPA to lose a vote, it would have to wait at least three years before referring the matter again to the CAC. 
In 2001 the committee oversaw a BALPA-proposed ballot at Ryanair, in which only 19% of pilots voted for the 
union.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary took a typically abusive verbal swipe at transport minister Noel Dempsey last week. 
Nothing new in that, of course, but it does draw attention to an ever widening gulf between business and politics 
which would have been inconceivable 20 years ago.
It is something that concerns some of Backroom's more reflective colleagues. There was a time when 
businesspeople were willing to be active in politics and seen as such. Not surprisingly, most of these were involved 
in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the PDs.
While some were out to further their own interests through schmoozing in places like the famous Galway Races 
tent, many more were engaged through a form of civic duty and belief that, if they talked to politicians, more 
business-informed government policies and a stronger economy might result. This applied to parties whether they 
were in government or opposition and was a benefit to all.
It's not as if our politicians don't need advice from the coalface of enterprise .Not a single Fianna Fáil member of the 
government has mainstream business experience, although, to his credit, Eamon Ryan from the Greens ran a 
successful cycling tourism venture in the past.
Those whispering in the ears of our ministers are hardly any better. While every public service reform scheme since 
the mid-1990s has proposed greater movement between senior civil servants and the private sector so that our 
mandarins can get 'real world' experience, in fact there has been almost none. The civil service remains gloriously 
insulated from cold winds.
The retreat of business from politics has also weakened the representative nature of the Dáil. There are fewer 
members with the experience and insight of running a business coming into politics. John McGuinness of Fianna 
Fáil was a rare exception, but his relatively brief junior ministerial career in the Department of Enterprise crashed in 
flames earlier this year and he made his views clearly known on how government and business could work better.
Why it's time for business and politics to get back together
Since so many of our elected politicians do not come from business, then a business input to them becomes more 
important.
Close dialogue between the enterprise sector and politics brings benefits to both. For business, it is ensuring that 
politics understands what is needed to create wealth. For politics it is the knowledge that discussions and decisions 
are informed by the expertise of those active in the front line of the economy.
But businesspeople have become afraid of politics and politicians. Tribunal revelations of political corruption have 
led many of them to stand back, out of fear of taint by association.
Now, when they need to interface with politicians, they use intermediaries from PR and public affairs companies.
The PR industry has flourished as the filter through which communications between both sides pass. Business now 
only approaches politicians when a specific sectoral item is of concern. It almost never contributes to broader 
debate.
If the business and politics stand-off continues, it will be to the detriment of public life in this country.
A few years ago, in a rare interview, Dermot Desmond expressed his detached view of politics when he said: ''I'm 
avoiding politicians." That's a pity. Having backed several Irish companies at the cutting edge of the knowledge 
economy, he surely must have worthwhile insights into current political decisions on the subject. In other areas too, 
he must have views that could make a difference. As our tourist industry struggles, for instance, he co-owns one of 
the world's most luxurious hotels.
It would be interesting, too, for example, to hear the views of Barry O'Callaghan of Education Media and Publishing 
on the state of education here, or those of other entrepreneurs who have built successful enterprises in recent 
years in Ireland.
Across all sectors of economic activity, there are men and women who have real experience and insight into what 
our economy needs to compete and develop. Collectively despairing of politicians on the golf course to each other 
may let off steam, but is ultimately unfulfilling and an under-utilisation of the brain-power and experience they could 
offer.
The official voice of business to the government, Ibec, up to recently ha all the access that a fully-fledged social 
partner could expect in consultations and decision making.
But does it ever articulate the views of authentic entrepreneurs and self-made businesspeople?
Many of the biggest contributors to Ibec are semi-state companies with their own complicated self survival agendas 
and worker directors.
The banks are also major contributors to Ibec, but they too have quite separate needs these days.
How many heavyweight business voices expressed views on Colm McCarthy's recent report? Major policy 
decisions and discussions that affect enterprise are dominated by debate led by academics, social partners and 
politicians, rather than by those in frontline job and wealth creation.
The occasions when a major business figure participated in RTE's Questions &Answers in recent years have been 
very few and far between. Maybe Pat Kenny's new show in the autumn will address this, but don't hold your breath.
Irish public life cannot afford to have its entrepreneurs retreating from debate and discussion about the direction of 
the country. Business needs to re-engage with politics.

Ryanair has again slammed the long delays experienced by travellers at Dublin Airport because of queues at the 
security desks.
It said that the delay resulted in Ryanair and Aer Lingus passengers missing flights this morning.
Ryanair claimed that passengers are regularly wasting up to 45 minutes in Dublin Airport security queues even 
though passenger numbers are down 12pc at Dublin Airport so far this year.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Passengers are paying E15 to the DAA Monopoly to pass through Dublin 
Airport and E10 to the Irish Government to leave the country but repeated delays at the DAA Monopoly are causing 
passengers to regularly miss their flights. Passenger numbers are down 12pc at Dublin yet the DAA Monopoly is 
still unable to deliver passengers an efficient service. The DAA continues to lie to the travelling public with its false 
claim that it takes 'a maximum of 15 minutes' to clear security at Dublin Airport. The DAA also deny that passengers 
are missing flights as a result of security delays when clearly they are. Again today, Ryanair and Aer Lingus 
passengers missed flights due to DAA incompetence and it is time for the DAA to properly manage security so that 
passengers never spend more than 10-15minutes in queues."

A rebound on global equity markets prompted strong share buying in Dublin today with stocks gaining across the 
board.
The ISEQ rose by 68.16 points to 2,944.57.
U.S. stocks rose on Thursday after a snap back in Chinese equities offset a surprise rise in weekly jobless claims 
and other data that showed a mixed picture of the world's top economy.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 42.39 points, or 0.46 percent, at 9,321.55. The Standard and Poor's 500 
Index was up 8.49 points, or 0.85 percent, at 1,004.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 15.47 points, or 0.79 
percent, at 1,984.71. After a lacklustre week so far, Dublin shares made good ground with banks, CRH and Ryanair 
gaining the most. Next week will be one of the most important on the equities calendar with ten of the index's top 
stocks all reporting second half results. These are: Kingspan, CRH, Kerry Group, Irish Life and Permanent, Tullow 
Oil, Glanbia, FBD, Kenmare and Grafton Group. CRH is the biggest stock on the ISEQ by market cap and reveals 
its first half results on Tuesday next. Davy are forecasting revenue of just over E8.6bn for the period with operating 
profit of E244m, representing year-on-year falls of 12pc and 66pc respectively. The sharpest declines are expected 
to be in the European Materials and Products divisions, which suffered weak demand (particularly in the first half of 
this year). The brokers are forecasting earnings per share of 14.1c for the period, 80pc below the 69.3c reported for 
the same time last year. Shares in the construction materials giant jumped 67c to E18.57 and did most to keep the 
ISEQ out of the red. Banks shares also helped lift the index with AIB up 13c to E2.12, Bank of Ireland gained 6c to 
E2.12 and Irish Life and Permanent fell by 5c to E3.60. IL and P deliver its half-year results on Wednesday. 
Reduced life and pension profits are unlikely to be enough to absorb an anticipated first half loss in the bank, 
according to Davy analyst, Emer Lang. Her forecast for bank operating profit before impairment is down two-thirds 
year-on-year to E48m (from E95m in the same period in 2008) as lower revenues (down 35pc on weak demand, 
ISEQ surges in line with global markets ISEQ Up
tighter margins, cost of guarantee) are barely offset by costs (-7pc). In its May interim management statement, the 
bancassurance firm raised impairment guidance to its previous stress scenario level of 160 basis points over the 
three years from 2009 to 2011. "We have E157m, or 80bps annualised, pencilled in for the first half, which 
generates a bank loss of E109m and a group operating loss of E48m (our full year loss forecast is E67m)," Ms Lang 
said. Kerry will report its interim results on Tuesday. For the first half, Davy expect an adjusted earnings per share 
outcome of 66.3c (+5.5pc year-on-year). Following on from its May 12th interim management statement (IMS), we 
expect management to reiterate guidance for the full year of adjusted EPS between 160c and 165c (Davy: 161.6c). 
Kerry's shares were down 26c at E17.45. Ryanair shares climbed 10c to E3.14.

As Ryanair never tires of telling investors, three things matter in a low-fare airline: costs, costs and costs. Thanks to 
a collapse in premium demand, that mantra has begun to echo around the less cheap-and-cheerful carriers. On 
Wednesday, announcing full-year earnings to the end of June, Qantas chief Alan Joyce promised an unyielding 
fixation on overheads to take out A$1.5bn over three years, or roughly 12 per cent of last year's cost base. 
Mr Joyce, former head of Jetstar, the airline's discount arm, has little choice. The self-styled "spirit of Australia" has 
been flagging for a while - quite apart from the savage industry downturn. Competition is intensifying, both at home 
and abroad. Singapore Airlines' Tiger, a Jetstar clone, last month began shuttling between Sydney and Melbourne; 
Virgin Blue, the other half of the domestic duopoly that has a combined 95 per cent share, is cooking up an alliance 
with Delta to put pressure on Qantas' transpacific yields. A credit rating downgrade six months ago, meanwhile, 
explains the group's decision to pull a planned 40 per cent float of its frequent flyer programme, its most 
dependable cash-generating asset. (That decision was surely taken with a heavy heart: Air Canada's Aeroplan, 
spun off four years ago, now has a market capitalisation 10 times greater than its former parent.)
Mr Joyce's cost initiatives are nothing extraordinary: scrapping aircraft orders, cutting underperforming routes, 
freezing executive pay. But what they mean, in practice, is further replacement of the old Qantas ways of doing 
things with those of six-year-old Jetstar. Full-year operating profits at the budget offshoot, at A$107m, were more 
than 25 times better than the core Qantas brands; it will soon compete directly with its parent on domestic routes to 
counter Tiger. Squinting into the distance, the group forswore any earnings guidance. But now, and for the 
foreseeable future, cheap is  cheerful.

Europe's smaller airlines want access to European Investment Bank (EIB) funding as some will battle to stay in 
business this winter, according to the head of the European Regions Airline Association (ERA).
The ERA also took the opportunity to take a pot-shot at Ireland's Ryanair, calling its chief executive, Michael 
O'Leary a "cheap tailor".
The ERA, which represents 65 regional airlines, has sent a paper to the European Commission (EC) asking for 
access to EIB loans, which are available to other ailing industries such as car manufacturing.
"If a number of carriers have to endure a poor winter, cash resources are very limited. Regional carriers are in 
trouble as they have already been parsimonious. They've got (no costs) to cut, so some airlines are going to find it 
desperately difficult to survive," ERA Director General Mike Ambrose told Reuters. "This is a much bigger crisis 
than 9/11, but the EC has been very slow to react to it ... What is needed is access to cash, we have asked for 
European bank funds to be released." European finance ministers last year approved E31 billion in extra lending by 
the EIB to boost the availability of credit for companies caught short by the credit crisis and the resulting global 
economic downturn. Ambrose said in an interview at ERA's headquarters that without extra cash several more 
smaller European airlines could go bust in what he described as the worst conditions for the industry since "day one 
of World War Two". He also slammed Ryanair. When asked to comment on the dominant position of the Irish no-
frills carrier, now the biggest airline in Europe by market capitalisation and passenger numbers, Ambrose said: 
"(Chief executive) Michael O'Leary is a cheap tailor. He has allowed a lot of people to buy clothes at affordable 
prices, but done nothing for the tailoring profession," he said. Ryanair has cut services at London Stansted and 
Manchester in recent days and opened a new base in Leeds Bradford, northeast England, causing shares in Dart 
Group, owner of small Leeds airline Jet2, to fall 10 percent.

Why Turquoise backers have no reason to feel blue

Body
Vexed by established airlines' high prices, lack of flexibility and general disdain for customer wellbeing, a low-cost 
carrier, Air Turquoise, is born. Together with other airlines set up on the same basis, it triggers a revolution: fares 
come down, restrictions are lifted and - miracle of miracles - British Exchangeways, LuftBörse and the other 
incumbents start to treat their customers with more respect.
In a nutshell, that's the story of Turquoise, the pan-European share trading facility, now "exploring strategic 
options", or, more bluntly, touting itself around for a potential sale. But unlike EasyJet or Ryanair, Turquoise's 
founders were not a grinning Greek or an irascible Irishman, but the passengers themselves - frequent flyers from 
nine investment banks.
Does it matter to these backers exactly what the fate of Turquoise will be? Probably not. It has already put the wind 
up incumbents, helped force prices down and catalysed innovation. On this side of the Atlantic, Chi-X, another 
trading platform, deserves the credit for being the first to rattle the London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse and 
competitors. But it was Turquoise and its high-rolling backers that captured most of the headlines.
If you want proof of the changes wrought by competition, simply observe the LSE's recent moves. Even Dame 
Clara Furse, always a staunch defender of the LSE's inherent superiority, bowed to the new reality by flexing the 
exchange's tariffs before stepping down as chief executive. Her successor, rally-driving Xavier Rolet, has 
accelerated the process. On September 1, the LSE will switch back to a model offering volume discounts to 
investment banks, the core customers that Mr Rolet - a former investment banker himself - has been courting 
assiduously.
Turquoise was no mere stalking horse. When the liquidity provision agreement Turquoise signed with its backers 
expired in March, the value of trades on the platform dropped to the same level as rivals, but they have revived 
since - evidence, its fans say, that Turquoise remains a valuable property. Of course, this may be trader talk. On the 
other side, you're still as likely to hear the LSE extol its arch-rival's strengths as you are to hear Michael O'Leary 
sing the praises of British Airways. But the banks can afford to be smug: whatever happens to Air Turquoise, they 
know they can now count on cheap flights long into the future.

Body
Ryanair raised the stakes in its battle to drive down airport landing costs by announcing yesterday that it will end 
almost all its flights from Manchester.
The Irish low-cost carrier, which has long campaigned to reduce charges at the largest UK airport outside London, 
said dropping nine of its 10 destinations would cost 600 jobs.
Last week it said it would open a base with 14 routes at Leeds Bradford airport in a £86m investment, creating 100 
jobs.
"Ryanair continues to lower fares to encourage travel, but with passengers paying lower fares airports must lower 
their charges - particularly high-cost airports like Manchester, London Stansted and Dublin," the airline said.
"Ryanair had offered new routes, traffic and growth to Manchester airport but since they prefer to preserve their 
high cost base than to grow, Ryanair will now switch/close nine Manchester routes to East Midlands, Leeds 
Bradford and Liverpool from October 1, resulting in the loss of 600,000 passengers per year and up to 600 jobs at -
Manchester."
However, Manchester airport said the impact would not be as severe as Ryanair claimed. There would be few direct 
job losses except among baggage handlers and check-in staff. "Low-cost carriers do not support as many jobs as 
scheduled airlines," he said.
The council-owned airport was willing to reduce the £3 per passenger charge Ryan-air pays but not by as much as 
the airline wanted.

Ryanair's war against "screenscrapers" continued today after it lodged proceedings in the High Court in Dublin

"Unister has also refused Ryanair's offer of licensed access to Ryanair's website for legitimate price comparison

The latest case follows the signing last week of binding declarations by a number of screenscrapers to stop

strategy of defending consumer rights in Irish courts is proving successful and the number of active screenscrapers

It said it is switching the services to lower cost competitor airports in East Midlands, Leeds Bradford and Liverpool 
(from 1st Oct) after Manchester Airport refused to lower its charges.
Ryanair said the move will result in the loss of 44 weekly Manchester flights, 600,000 passengers p.a. and up to

Ryanair is to close or switch nine of its 10 routes from Manchester Airport, with the loss of 600 jobs.
Most of the routes will be switched to alternative airports including East Midlands, Leeds Bradford and Liverpool, 
the budget airline said in a statement today. In total, some 44 weekly flights from Manchester will be axed from 1 
October.
Ryanair blamed the decision on Manchester Airport's refusal to lower its own charges, which the airline had 
requested in response to the lower fares it was now charging its own customers. 
The announcement comes less than a week after the Irish airline announced plans to expand its Leeds Bradford 
base.
'Ryanair continues to lower fares to encourage travel, but with passengers paying lower fares airports must lower 
their charges particularly high cost airports like Manchester, London (Stansted) and Dublin,' the statement said.
'Ryanair apologises to passengers affected by these cancellations and will contact them in the coming weeks to 
provide them with a full refund or a switch to similar flights to/from lower cost airports in the region.'
Further details on the flights affected are available here.

Ryanair shifts cash to 'safer' banks
Ryanair shifts cash to 'safer' banks

Section: THE MARKET
Length: 202 words

Ryanair has shifted some of its cash deposits in recent months to banks that were perceived as safer than others, 
amid concerns over the risk profile of certain banks.
The airline cited ''a shift to more defensive deposits'' as one of the factors behind a fall-off in its interest income in 
the three months to June.
Howard Millar, Ryanair's deputy chief executive and chief financial officer, told analysts that a more conservative 
strategy in managing the airline's deposits, coupled with a lower interest rate environment following the ECB's 
recent round of rate cutting, had contributed to the decline in net interest income during the quarter.
Ryanair holds cash balances of more than  2 billion, but chief executive Michael O'Leary has said that the airline 
has strict treasury guidelines to ensure it is not exposed in the event of an individual bank collapsing.
Management of cash balances is an important part of the airline's operations as interest income accounted for  75 
million in the year to March 2009. While lower interest rates hurt its interest income line, the company also benefits 
from lower rates as its borrowings exceed its cash balance, leaving the airline with net debt of around  100 million.

Caught a plane recently? How was the flight? If you're honest, it was probably a horrible experience. The airports 
are packed to the rafters, even more now that we are in the holiday season. The check-in desks are overwhelmed. 
The staff can be bossy, and the rules ridiculous.
The additional charges range from the baffling to the infuriating. Allocated seats have been abolished, along with 
the meals. It is hell 30,000 feet up.
There is no question that flying is a less pleasant experience than it was 30 years ago. Economists tell us that most 
products get better over time in a free market. The airlines have managed to rip up that rulebook.
The question is whether other industries will follow the same path or whether the airlines will find a way to make 
flying fun again. In the last decade, most carriers have stripped out just about everything that made flying a 
tolerable, sometimes even pleasurable experience.
Cattle on the way to the abattoir receive better care than most passengers do on the new breed of budget airline. 
The North Korean postal service probably knows more about putting the customer first than most airline staff. 
People have noticed.
Two of the biggest hits on the internet this year have been from exasperated air travellers.
There was a letter to Virgin Atlantic Airways president Richard Branson complaining about the ''culinary journey of 
hell'' on a Virgin flight. United Airlines was expertly dissected by a country singer aggrieved that the carrier had 
damaged his guitar. His song, United Breaks Guitars, has had almost five million views on YouTube. The trouble is, 
it's about to get much worse.
Ryanair, the airline that prides itself on its no-frills service, is now thinking about charging for one of the few 
remaining frills - using the toilet.
Comment
It is already getting rid of check in desks, and the company plans to make passengers carry all their baggage onto 
the plane. Soon, they will probably get us to bring along a few litres of jet fuel as well. The Chinese carrier Spring 
Airlines is contemplating selling standing only tickets to pack more people onto its planes, according to a report on 
MSNBC. Even British Airways, which used to boast about the quality of its service, is joining the rush down to cattle 
class.
Last month, the airline said free meals were being abolished after 10am for flights of less than two and a-half hours. 
It may not be long before they put you in your suitcase and charge you for breathing. On one level, we know what is 
happening. The no-frills, budget business model has triumphed. Passengers have shown that they always take the 
cheapest possible flight, forcing all the airlines to cut costs drastically.
Flying used to be an exciting, glamorous event. When I was a kid, friendly flight attendants would take you up to the 
cockpit to have a chat with the pilot and see how it all worked. These days, they don't even let parents sit next to 
their children unless the whole family runs like crazy onto the plane elbowing aside everyone in front of them.
Of course, it's true that flights are cheaper, and there are more of them. Yet that isn't quite the explanation. Most 
industries' products are cheaper and better than they were ten years ago: it's true of computers, cars, televisions, 
and just about any consumer product you can think of.
And consumers don't normally opt to trade a dramatic decline in quality for lower prices. Think about what would 
happen if they did. We would all be staying in Spartan hotels right next to a motorway. Restaurants would be 
serving us ready-made meals from tins - awful but very cheap. The barber would get out his sheep shears and give 
us a trim.
Only when it comes to air tickets have consumers decided that price is all that matters. The rational choice we 
make between price and quality in most other purchases doesn't happen.
Airports may be giving us a glimpse of the future. In 20 years' time, perhaps every industry will be run on the 
Ryanair model: drive down prices to the minimum, and tell the customer to take a hike.
Alternatively, perhaps the airline industry is still in transition from old state-run monopolies to a free market. That 
process has gone crazy, allowing companies a period of freedom in which they can be as rude to the customer as 
they like and get away with it. Over time, a better compromise between price and quality will emerge.
Something needs to be done about air travel. Otherwise, we might be tempted to throw ourselves out of the 
emergency exit - even if there is an extra  10 charge for doing so.

Real leadership is crucial

John Kotter, one of the foremost writers on leadership, believes that most companies are over-managed and under-
led because their executives do not have a clear understanding of what leadership is.
As we reflect on the boom years, it is clear that many Irish companies produced spectacular results. For many 
however, the emphasis was on management rather than leadership.
Such emphasis may not be sufficient for companies to survive this current recession. While many of our current 
economic problems are global in origin, it is also true that the actions of some senior executives and board 
members in Ireland played a significant part in the deterioration of the economy.
The Greek word hubris sums up the action of many of these executives. The impact of their decisions affects not 
just their own shareholders but, particularly in the case of the banks, the entire community.
For bank shareholders, their wealth was all but destroyed. Were it not for the systemic importance of those banks to 
the Irish economy, they would have faced complete collapse.
It is important to state that good management is extremely important and can certainly achieve efficiency. Ryanair, 
for example, has extremely tight managerial systems in place to enable it to minimise its cost base - an essential 
element in pursuing a low-fares strategy.
That model however, is limited in its application. In the future, most companies in Ireland will be competing in the 
'knowledge economy'. For such companies, the emphasis must be on leadership and getting the best out of people 
to promote creativity.
People at every level respond positively to leadership - leadership that creates a long term vision of where the 
organisation is heading; leadership that is based on sound values that people can believe in and stand over; and 
leadership that has a sense of purpose that they can relate to.
Real leadership is crucial
Such leadership will result in solid performance that is sustainable in terms of creating long-term shareholder wealth 
as well as having a positive impact on all stakeholders.
The difference between leadership and management is also borne out by the attitude of many companies to ethics 
and corporate governance. The failure of the 'light touch' approach to regulation has been well highlighted. While 
regulation may have failed, the primary responsibility must lie with each company's board of directors and 
management.
Again, there have been many dismal failures in this regard, some of which are currently under investigation by 
various relevant authorities.
Leadership supports an ethical approach to business; an approach that goes beyond the rule of law and focuses on 
doing the 'right thing'. Fair Trade is an organisation whose aim is to promote ethical standards and sustainability 
throughout the value chain of participating firms. It ensures a fair price for producers in developing countries.
Another writer on leadership, Jim Collins, examined companies that had significantly outperformed the market over 
a long period. He found the one common denominator in these highly successful companies was the particular 
leadership style of their chief executives, which he described as 'Level 5' leadership.
They weren't charismatic leaders constantly in the limelight, but people who possessed ''a paradoxical blend of 
personal humility and professional will''. They were highly driven but their focus was the long term sustainability of 
their organisation, rather than short term gain.
There are many functions that leaders perform in organisations. In addition to having a clear vision for the future, 
leaders must be able to communicate clearly. They must also promote sound values throughout the company and 
ensure they are reflected in the organisation's strategy. Leaders must be able to anticipate and lead change.
Leadership is about motivating those in the organisation to be innovative, and adaptive as circumstances evolve. 
Building effective teams is an essential element of that process. This requires getting good people to work for the 
company and ensuring that the right people are in the right place.
Developing these people to reach their full potential is also essential, and therefore mentoring is an important 
element of leadership. That includes grooming people for succession at every level, including at chief executive. For 
example, Kerry Group, the global food company, has achieved a very successful transition from Denis Brosnan, its 
first chief executive through Hugh Friel and on to current chief executive Stan McCarthy.
The company within which people work must also be developed into a high-performance environment - what is 
often referred to as a 'learning organisation'.
This is where leadership is of fundamental importance - creating the environment in which intelligent people are 
inspired, where leaders are authoritative not authoritarian.
That means keeping a strong focus on where the organisation is heading while at the same time energising 
employees to give their best willingly to the organisation. Leadership is fundamentally about people. The results will 
follow.

Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "These legal commitments by screenscraping websites are the latest positive

Airline seeks happy landings with cut-price fee deals
Airline seeks happy landings with cut-price fee deals

Michael O'Leary, the combative airline chief executive, calls it the "Ryanair effect", writes Andrew Bounds.
For some critics that may mean swarms of stag parties cavorting in   bars across Europe. But for the 34 cities 
around the continent where Ryanair bases its aircraft, it means jobs and spending power.
The company claims that for every 1m passengers using an airport, 1,000 jobs are sustained. It also quotes 
industry figures that the average airline passenger spends EUR430 (£367) at their destination.
On these measures, its 11 UK bases preserve 29,000 jobs and generate £7bn for the UK economy. However, the 
company's hunt for lower fees has increasingly taken it to mainland Europe.
What is clear is that Ryanair gives small airports critical mass and puts cities such as Treviso (for Venice) on the 
map. Bristol saw passenger numbers rise from 1.5m to 6m after dropping its objections to low-fare airlines.
However, the effect can be double-edged. Ryanair succeeds by negotiating cut-price landing fee deals. This year, it 
moved an aircraft from Liverpool to Naples, with the loss of   50 jobs, citing high UK taxes.
"We carry 67m passengers [annually]," said the airline. "That is true whether we do it based primarily in the UK and 
Ireland or Spain and Italy. Airports in Spain and Italy are giving us amazing deals because they realise they will get 
the volume they need."

Highlight: $140m investment in Leeds Bradford
Region hopes for boost to tourism
Body
A $140m investment by Ryanair, the Irish low-cost carrier, in Leeds Bradford International Airport will be a big shot 
in the arm for the regional economy, local business and political leaders said yesterday.
Andrew Carter, joint leader of Leeds city council, said the decision by Ryanair, which is to set up its 11th UK base at 
the airport, to handle two aircraftwhen it was cutting back at others because of the recession showed "a huge 
amount of confidence in our city region".
Ryanair said it would create 100 direct jobs and sustain up to 1,000 others in the area as it served 14 new routes.
Mr Carter said: "It is a very positive move. They are a very successful company and it is great they have chosen to 
locate here."
He said the challenge was to ensure that overseas visitors were attracted to Yorkshire. Ryanair says it could spend 
EUR64m (£55m) annually.
Ryanair is one of the few airlines still expanding and it expects to double its passenger numbers at Leeds Bradford, 
where it already operates flights to Dublin, Girona and Alicante, to more than 1m annually from March next year 
when the new routes open. This would boost the numbers using the airport by 20 per cent. It aims to attract local 
passengers who at present travel to Manchester for holiday flights.
The move vindicates the decision by five local councils in 2007 to sell the airport for £145.5m to Bridgepoint Capital, 
the private equity firm. Bridgepoint is investing more than £80m at the site, including a £28m terminal building to 
increase capacity to 5m passengers a year. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said this had been a big 
factor in the company's decision.
John Parkin, airport chief executive, said the announcement guaranteed growth next year. "This is a major 
milestone in the 78-year history of this airport, particularly in the current market," he said.
Yorkshire welcomes new Ryanair base
Leeds Bradford served 2.8m passengers in 2008 and expects that to fall about 7 per cent to 2.6m this year. That 
compares with a 12 per cent year-on-year fall across UK airports as a whole.
The only access to the airport is by road through the Leeds suburbs, and the airport is lobbying for a light railway 
connection. However, Mr O'Leary said the time and money saved by not having to go to Manchester meant 
passengers would still come.
More than 3m people a year travel from Yorkshire to Manchester to fly to short-haul destinations and the airport is 
seeking to capture most of that market. Ryanair will add flights to tourism hot spots such as Faro in Portugal and 
Krakow in Poland.
The airline recently announced winter cutbacks at Stansted airport and froze expansion at its nine other UK bases. 
But Mr O'Leary said yesterday it was committed to expansion at lower-cost airports.
In typically blunt style, he said there was little sign of recession-hit Britons sacrificing summer holidays abroad. "The 
weather's rubbish and so is the cricket," he said. "People want a couple of weeks in the sun. The only people I 
know who are 'staycationing' are boring buggers like Gordon Brown."

Shares of the two main Irish banks dropped in early trading today on the impact of last night's Supreme Court 
rejection of developer Liam Carroll's appeal.
The court confirmed an earlier High Court ruling which lifted court protection from six Carroll companies.
There are fears that the decision could undermine the plans of the NAMA "bad bank" to take over problem loans 
from developers.
AIB was down by 7c to 194 in early deals today, with AIB dropping 12c to 189. Irish Life and Permanent gained 2c 
to 350. Shares in the Smurfit Kappa packaging group gained 13c to 438 on news that it plans a price hike from 
September. The group also posted a 77pc drop in second quarter profits this morning. Other big names also made 
gains. CRH was up 12c a short time ago at 1752, with DCC ahead by 20c at 1525 and Elan 5c up at 540. Ryanair 
had gained 1c to 306.

Stocks Close Modestly Lower Amid Profit Taking - U.S. Commentary

Body
(RTTNews) - Stocks posted modest losses on Monday, as traders cashed in on recent gains amid a lack of 
significant moves. The major averages all finished in negative territory, kicking off the week on a sour note.
The decline came ahead of some key economic reports on tap for this week, including data on retail sales, 
industrial production and weekly jobless claims.
Further, the Federal Open Market Committee will make its interest rate announcement on Wednesday, with the key 
fed funds rate expected to remain unchanged amid a challenging economic environment.
On the corporate front, Freddie Mac (FRE) said late Friday that it no longer needs government aid, as the mortgage 
lender posted a positive net worth.
Benefiting from accounting adjustments and gains, Freddie Mac reported a second quarter profit of $821 million on 
a notable increase in revenues to $7.47 billion from last year's $1.59 billion.
Warren Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) reported a 14 percent increase in second quarter earnings, 
fueled by gains from derivatives trading, which soared to $1.53 billion from $453 million in the second quarter of last 
year. The firm earned $1,147 per share, while Wall Street analysts expected the company to earn $1,238 per share 
for the quarter.
Microsoft (MSFT), which recently struck a ten-year deal with Yahoo (YHOO) to share search engine technology and 
ad revenue, announced an agreement with French ad company Publicis to sell its Razorfish digital advertising unit.
The major averages regained some ground going into the close of trading, although they remained stuck in the red. 
The Dow closed down by 32.12 points or 0.3 percent at 9,337.95, the Nasdaq slipped by 8.01 points or 0.4 percent 
to 1,992.24 and the S&P 500 fell by 3.38 points or 0.3 percent to 1,007.10.
Sector News
Steel and gold stocks fell by notable margins, with the NYSE Arca Steel Index and the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index 
posting losses of 2.8 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Despite the pullback, the indices remained stuck in 
recent ranges amid a lack of conviction in commodity prices.
Stocks Close Modestly Lower Amid Profit Taking - U.S. Commentary
Airline stocks also saw significant weakness, with the NYSE Arca Airline Index retreating by 2.5 percent on the 
session. With the loss, the index pulled back off the more than six-month closing high it set on Friday.
The index was dragged down by shares of Delta Airlines (DAL), U.S. Airways (LCC) and Ryanair (RYAAY), which 
all fell by more than 4 percent on the session.
Housing and commercial real estates stocks also retreated, with the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index sliding by 
3.4 percent, while the Morgan Stanley REIT Index fell by 2.4 percent on the day. The housing index backed off of its 
best closing level in ten months, while the real estate index pulled away from a nine month closing high.
While additional downside was visible among railroad, retail and wireless stocks, some electronic storage, 
healthcare provider, and natural gas posted strong gains, limiting the downside for the markets.
Dow Components
The retreat by the Dow was led by shares of 3M (MMM), which dropped by 2.7 percent on the day. With the loss, 
the stock backed off of its best closing price in nearly a year.
Additionally, Cisco (CSCO) and Alcoa (AA) also fell, sliding by 2.5 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. With the 
decline, the stocks retreated away from their highest closing prices in ten months posted late last week.
Travelers (TRV), Boeing (BA), DuPont (DD) and Caterpillar (CAT) also retreated, while McDonald's (MCD) posted a 
strong gain.
The gain by McDonald's came after the company announced that its global comparable sales rose 4.3 percent in 
July, benefiting from a 7.2 percent jump in sales in Europe. The stock closed up by 1.9 percent, bouncing further off 
the two-month closing low set last Thursday.
Merck (MRK), Bank of America (BAC), Intel (INTC) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) also advanced, moderating the 
loss by the blue chip index.
Other Markets
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region largely turned in strong performances on Monday. 
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 Index rose by 1.1 percent, reaching a ten-month high, while Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng Index surged up by 2.7 percent.
Meanwhile, the major European markets turned in a mixed performance, with the French CAC 40 Index and the 
German DAX Index closing down by 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index 
rose by 0.7 percent.
In the bond markets, treasuries saw considerable gains amid the pullback on Wall Street. Subsequently, the yield 
on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, closed at 3.771 percent, a loss of 8.3 basis 
points.
Looking Ahead
Tuesday, traders will delve into data from the Labor Department on productivity and costs for the second quarter. 
Productivity is expected to jump to 5.5 percent on an annual rate compared to 3.0 percent in the previous quarter, 
while costs are forecast to decline by 2.5 percent after rising by 3.0 percent in the last period. The report is due out 
at 8:30 a.m. ET.

* Aer Lingus has negotiated a new deal with Airbus on the delivery of new planes and has decided to reduce its 
long-haul fleet by two planes through early termination of existing lease agreements. One A330 plane will leave the 
fleet in October, 18 months ahead of schedule, while a second will leave next March, 14 months ahead of schedule. 
Aer Lingus said it had deferred delivery of new planes from Airbus which will allow it to keep its long-haul fleet at 
eight aircraft until 2013. It said this would significantly reduce its capital commitments over the next three years.
* Ryanair carried 6.7 million passengers in July, an increase of 19 per cent on the same period last year. The airline 
said the July figure was a record high. The percentage of seats filled was unchanged from a year earlier at 89 per 
cent, though the average for the last 12 months is 82 per cent.
Meanwhile, the number of passengers carried by British Airways last month dipped by 1.2 per cent compared with 
July 2008, the airline announced last week.
* The euro hit an eight-month high against the US dollar, reaching above $1.44 following fresh signs of an economic 
recovery. A key US industrial indicator and manufacturing data from the eurozone added to confidence after US 
growth data showed a narrower-than expected 1 per cent decline in output in the second quarter.
* The European Central Bank kept its main interest rate unchanged on Thursday, at a record low of 1 per cent, as 
expected by economists. On the same day, the Bank of England pumped stg£50 billion more into the economy as 
the British central bank moved to shore up signs of a fragile recovery. The bank's Monetary Policy Committee voted 
to hold interest rates at their record low of 0.5 per cent.

Show of resilience helps boost BA

British Airways shares jumped yesterday after it disclosed more resilient monthly traffic volumes than had been 
expected from the business customers that are its most lucrative market segment.
Premium passenger traffic fell 11 per cent year-on-year in July.
Although a sharp decline, it was far less than the   crippling 17 per cent falls that have been common in recent 
months as companies cut travel budgets in response to the global downturn.
The UK flag carrier said total revenue passenger kilometres, a measure of passenger traffic, rose 1 per cent last 
month thanks to a 3.5 per cent spurt in non-premium traffic.
Passenger load factors, a measure of how many seats are filled, improved 3.1 percentage points to 84.6 per cent 
as BA began to match capacity more closely to the reduced demand.
BA's shares rose 7.7 per cent to 161.7p.
Traffic numbers from Ryanair, however, underscored the contrast between the performance of legacy airlines and 
low-cost carriers in what airlines claim   is the worst crisis in aviation history.
The Irish low-cost carrier said passenger traffic rose 19 per cent in July to 6.7m, a monthly record.
Ryanair is continuing to add capacity and open new routes as it benefits from customers trading down.
While Ryanair expects to double its profits this year, at the start of the month BA said it had fallen from   a pre-tax 
profit of £37m ($63m) a year ago to a pre-tax loss of £148m in its first quarter and saw "no signs of improvement".
BA is involved in a protracted dispute with unions as it struggles to improve productivity. It has cut thousands of jobs 
in the past year and is in talks over further job losses and cuts in pay and conditions.
Show of resilience helps boost BA
As part of its marketing efforts to restore premium traffic volumes, BA said it was offering free flights to 1,000 US 
businesspeople.
Ryanair shares closed up 21 cents to EUR3.18.

What crisis? Budget carriers thrive amid gloom

Budget airlines have found a silver lining in the global recession.
As travelers pinch pennies and opt for cheaper alternatives, AirAsia, Europe's Ryanair and other low-cost carriers 
are adding routes and buying new planes to grab a larger slice of global aviation at the expense of their more 
established rivals.
Major players such as British Airways and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways have reported full year losses for 
the first time in years despite cutting costs and flights to cope with a downturn in premium air travel.
Full service carriers, which once completely dominated the skies, are banking on an economic recovery to restore 
their fortunes but they may find it tough to return to the growth levels they enjoyed before the crisis.
"Full-service airlines have a bit of conundrum on their hands," said Derek Sadubin of the Sydney-based Center of 
Asia Pacific Aviation. "We think low-cost carriers will become so much more entrenched in airports and corporate 
travel that it will be difficult for them to claw their business back" when the economy recovers, he said.
To be sure, all airlines have struggled as oil prices soared in the last two years. Oil prices have since tumbled and 
despite a rally early this year, are still half the level of a year earlier.
But major industrialized economies continue to contract and economic conditions are likely to remain tough even 
when a recovery is under way. The International Air Travel Association in June predicted airline losses worldwide to 
swell to $9 billion this year, nearly double its previous forecast.
Full service carriers are the worst hit as the downturn has hammered business and first-class travel, which make up 
a small percentage of seats but account for up to 40 percent of their revenues.
Their smaller, no-frills rivals are weathering the recession better with a low-cost model that relies on high passenger 
volumes, stripping out costs through strategies such as taking the cheapest landing slots at airports and turning full 
service features like meals and check-in baggage into profit-making extras.
What crisis? Budget carriers thrive amid gloom
In Asia, budget aviation has seen exponential growth since the start of the decade and now has a 16 percent 
market share, Sadubin said.
The market share of low cost carriers could cross the 20 percent mark in the next one to two years, he said, as they 
open up new routes across the region and give travelers an option to fly at a fraction of the cost charged by full 
service airlines.
Malaysian-based AirAsia, the biggest low-cost carrier in the region, posted a record profit of 203.2 million ringgit 
($56.4 million) for the quarter through March, up 26 percent from a year earlier. Passengers soared 21 percent to 
3.15 million during the period while falling at regular airlines.
It has ordered new planes, made its debut in Europe with flights to London in March and is eyeing plans to enter the 
U.S. market.
"We are in the McDonald's, Wal Mart category. Business is booming as people are looking for value," AirAsia Chief 
Executive Tony Fernandes told The Associated Press in a recent interview.
AirAsia's success has generated rivals, the best known of which are Singapore-based Tiger Airways and Qantas 
Airways-owned Jetstar.
Tiger, which is 49 percent owned by Singapore Airlines, is rapidly expanding and has a total 56 new aircraft on 
order for delivery through to 2016. Tiger expects business travel to account for 15 percent of its total traffic by 
March 2010, more than triple from current levels.
Budget aviation has put down even stronger roots in the U.S. and Europe, with about a one-third market share in 
both regions, analysts said.
In Europe, Irish discount airline Ryanair remained on an expansionary course and forecasts a net profit of up to 250 
million euros ($350 million) for its 2010 fiscal year. It is eyeing plans to order up to 300 more aircraft in a deal that 
would make the Irish carrier more than double the size of British Airways.
In the cash-rich Middle East, analysts said budget aviation penetration is still low at less than five percent but new 
carriers have sprung up in recent months. FlyDubai, based in the United Arab Emirates, was launched in June and 
has unveiled ambitious expansion plans after ordering 50 Boeing 737 aircraft.
The intense competition from budget carriers has changed the rules of the game for some major airlines.
Many full service carriers are regularly churning up promotional offers with tickets at a discount of up to 80 percent 
in an effort to protect their market share.
Others like India's Jet Airways, Korean Air, and Malaysian Airlines have set up low-cost offshoots, relying on a two-
brand strategy to cushion earnings.
Some carriers have taken more drastic steps to focus on lower-fare volume business.
British Airways has announced it won't configure any new planes to offer first-class cabins. Qantas has also 
scrapped first-class service on several long-haul routes and is considering reducing the 72 business seats in its 
Airbus A380 superjumbo jets.
But Singapore Airlines, one of Asia's top carriers, remains confident of a recovery in the premium market. It has cut 
fares and capacity this year but said it would not crop the 60 business seats in its A380 planes.
"It's a cyclical business and positive growth will return. We are not going to fundamentally change our business 
focus overnight just because of the downturn," said spokesman Nicholas Ionides.

Volume takes precedence over revenue at Ryanair

At times like this, full planes are more important than empty pockets.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary reported yet more fare-cutting last week, as the airline announced results 
for the three months to June.
O'Leary told analysts that, when it came to a choice between losing revenue and losing passengers, he was happy 
to forego income to keep passenger numbers at target levels. ''The key thing to remember with Ryanair is that the 
variable here is never the passengers.
We'll hit the passenger numbers. The variable is always the yield," he said. ''We'll take whatever price. Whatever 
the yield will be, it will be. But we manage the business to ensure that we hit the traffic figures, the traffic and the 
load factor targets."
Last week's numbers backed up O'Leary's words. Revenues for the quarter were flat at  775 million, despite an 11 
per cent increase in passengers flying with the budget airline. O'Leary admitted cutting fares by an average of 13 
per cent to ensure that passenger numbers remained steady.
After-tax profits were far higher, however, at  137 million - up from  21 million a year earlier. This was thanks to a 42 
per cent fall in fuel costs, triggered by the non-recurrence of O'Leary's ill-fated oil price hedging strategy last year 
and a more favourable pricing environment.
O'Leary used last week's results announcement to once again hit out at travel taxes imposed by the British and Irish 
governments, and what he perceived as excessive airport charges at Stansted and Dublin airports.
''Our outlook remains extremely cautious for the remainder of the fiscal year," O'Leary said, adding that he expected 
passengers to be ''very price sensitive'' as falling disposable incomes and greater uncertainty took their toll.
Volume takes precedence over revenue at Ryanair
''Traffic growth is strong but at a much lower, weaker yield, partly due to the recession but also due to the impact of 
tourist taxes, particularly in Ireland and the UK."
O'Leary signalled his distaste for tourist taxes by switching capacity away from Britain and Ireland to locations he 
considered friendlier, such as Spain, Norway and Italy.
Guidance for the rest of 2009 remained heavily qualified by O'Leary's ''limited visibility'' beyond August and 
September, with full-year net profit expected to be at the lower end of the  200 million to  300 million range 
previously signalled, and yields down by 20 per cent.
''Much of this will be dependent on what the yield outturn is like for the winter, but I think we should be pessimistic 
rather than optimistic," he said. While some analysts disagreed, however, O'Leary dismissed suggestions he was 
overstating the extent of the challenges facing the sector.
''I think we should seriously disregard some of the lunatic analysts who are out there, coming up with forecasts and 
yields where the yield fall will be significantly lower than that. I don't know where they get their optimism from. I think 
they're just idiots."
Yet O'Leary displayed signs of optimism of his own, signalling ''enormous opportunities to grow the business'', as 
Ryanair was well placed to take advantage of the difficulties being faced by weaker rivals.
''Ryanair will, we believe, be the only major airline to deliver passenger and profit growth in the current year. The 
winners in this deep recession will always be those companies like Lidl, Aldi, McDonald's and Ryanair, which offer 
the lowest price and best service to consumers - and we're continuing to expand in a deep recession as others fail."
So, while other airlines struggle to attract passengers, O'Leary can trumpet the fact that his lower cost base allows 
him to discount fares to whatever level is necessary to stimulate demand. As long as passengers are in a position 
to respond to his pricing moves, it appears O'Leary will continue to fill the growing number of planes in his fleet.
But capacity cuts on routes from Dublin and London show that, in some instances, his model may not be as resilient 
as he would like.
''The traffic is growing strongly, the unit costs are falling. Yes, we're a little bit unsure about what the yield looks like 
for the [next ] six or nine months, but we're continuing to deliver very strong traffic and profit growth.
''I think that, by the end of this year, our position across Europe will be significantly enhanced, as all of our 
competitors continue to reduce flights and operations in those markets where they compete with us."
O'Leary may have preferred, however, if one of those competitors - Aer Lingus - was having a better time. Ryanair 
was forced to write down the value of its 29 per cent stake in the airline once again during the quarter, bringing its 
carrying value to just under  80 million. It is an irritation that O'Leary would prefer to be without.

Feargal Mooney is a good advertisement for a company that makes its money from budget travellers. Despite 
running one of the most profitable private firms in the country, the low-key chief executive of Web Reservations 
International (WRI) drives a Skoda and has spent his fair share of time staying in hostels. But there is nothing 
budget about WRI, which was founded in Dublin exactly ten years ago and is better known by its trading 
name,Hostelworld.com.
In its decade in business, the firm has handled more than 15 million online bookings for hostels around the world, 
totalling more than 71 million beds. In recent years, it has made headlines for its large profits and plans for a stock 
market listing that was expected to value it at several hundred million euro and turn its owners into multimillionaires 
several times over.
While the flotation was put on hold because of stockmarket turbulence, WRI has continued to grow under the 
stewardship of Mooney, who took over as chief executive early last year. He said 2008 was the company's busiest 
year yet, in terms of signing up hostels for its online booking system. It now handles bookings for more than 20,000 
properties in about 170 countries.
About 105 million people visited WRI websites last year, up from 83 million in 2007.Not all of those people booked 
accommodation, of course, but Mooney said that WRI recorded a ''double-digit growth in revenues'' last year, up 
from  34 million in 2007.
He would not comment on the firm's profits in 2008,because its accounts have yet to be signed off, but it made  
18.3 million profit before tax in 2007. By conducting business over the internet and the phone, the company's 90 
staff keep costs down and profits up.
However, Mooney readily admits that he is more comfortable talking about WRI's innovations than its finances, and 
the company has several developments on that front.
The world of hostels
They include an expansion into booking B&Bs and villas around the world, and launching an online travel store, 
which will sell everything from guide books to travel insurance. The company already has contracts with 6,000 
B&Bs around the world, and will launch a specific B&B site for people who are not keen on staying in hostels, 
according to Mooney. It is behind Eurovillas.
com, which allows villa owners to lease their properties. It also recently launched a similar site in conjunction with 
Ryanair, called Ryanairvillas.com.
''They are really just other extensions of the company," said Mooney, who described the company's customers as 
''the young and the young at heart''. Further diversification could bring WRI into particular niches, such as selling 
eco friendly or gay-friendly accommodation.
The company is also responding to a rise in mobile phone bookings - which are up three-fold this year on last year - 
with specific sites for iPhone and mobile phone users. Other technical developments allow users to alter their 
bookings details and store credit card details.
Mooney said that the most enjoyable aspect of his job was when the firm launched new technology, even if it was 
just a small feature on its websites. The firm builds all its own technology, which amounts to a ''significant 
investment'' every year, he said.
''It is significant, but we get a good return on it," said Mooney. ''It is important that we continue to invest. We are the 
global leader [in hostel bookings], but we should never be satisfied with what we have. We have to keep adding and 
adding to make it better."
He said that WRI expected continued strong growth, with a lot of potential in markets in South America and Asia. 
''There is increased demand from travellers coming from those markets, while people in Europe and North America 
are looking for new destinations," he said.
''Analysts think there is no money in this sector, but there are new hostels opening around the world all the time. 
There are new 800-bed hostels, there are hostels with bars and nightclubs, hostels with swimming pools and 
saunas, there are hostels in converted jumbo jet planes."
An investment analyst by training himself, Mooney was not with WRI at the very start, although the company was 
still in the start-up phase when he joined in January 2002. It had 12 employees in an office on Fitzwilliam Square 
and had yet to make a profit, but big plans were already under way.
With a mixture of experience that ranged from running a guesthouse to working in senior financial positions with 
Pfizer and Baltimore Technologies, Mooney was hired as chief operating officer of the young internet firm. From day 
one, he worked closely with the founders of the company, software entrepreneur Ray Nolan and hostel owner Tom 
Kennedy.
''Maybe my title was a bit fancy, but we had big aspirations. The ambition was there from the start," he said.
''They were beginning to realise that this could be something really big, but in order to get there, they needed to 
bring more structure to it."
Indeed, the firm had started out as Hosteldublin.com, with the aim of selling booking systems to accommodation 
providers in the Irish capital. It quickly became Hostelireland. com, followed by Hostel world.com, reflecting global 
demand for a centralised booking system.
The company gives its technology to hostel owners for free and is given an allocation of beds to book in return. 
When a customer uses WRI to make a booking for a particular hostel - whether it is in Dublin or Dubai - the 
company keeps the deposit they pay. More recently, it has developed revenues from online advertising and selling 
the other travel services.
The world of hostels
Mooney's early responsibilities at WRI included handling the finances of the loss-making dotcom and making sure 
there was enough money to pay the bills. The weight of that responsibility lightened in mid-2002 when the company 
began to turn a profit.
Profits have rocketed since then, helped by a series of acquisitions that started in 2002 when the company agreed 
to buy rivals Hostels.com. Mooney remembers faxing off an agreement on Christmas Eve that year to pay $3.75 
million for Hostels.com, even though WRI ''hadn't a bob''. They had until January 31, 2003, to find the money and 
complete the deal.
''We went out to try to raise the money and talked to a number of the banks. One bank said: 'There's just two things 
wrong with this company - one is 'hostels' and the other is 'dotcom'," according to Mooney. ''But we raised the 
money and we closed the deal."
Other deals followed, including the buyout of Hostels of Europe in 2004 and WorldRes, a hotel booking business, 
the following year. The WorldRes deal ''didn't work out entirely as planned'', according to Mooney, and that 
business has been restructured into Boo.com, a WRI owned site that combines travel information with reviews and 
social networking.
In the early years, the firm was funded by its founders, private investors and bank debt, with the shareholder 
register including U2 manager Paul McGuinness and other well-heeled businesspeople. Despite the bursting of the 
dotcom bubble in 2000 - the year after WRI was founded - it never faced insurmountable difficulties in raising 
finance.
''From a very early stage, there would have been quite a few shareholders involved in the company," said Mooney, 
who has a stake in the firm. ''We were pre-profit, so any time we needed to do something, we would bring in new 
shareholders.
''We went around to anybody we knew who knew anybody who had money. There were some industry people, 
some people who had a few quid, some friends and family."
The early shareholders were rewarded in 2004 when the company took on investment from Summit Partners, a US 
venture capital firm. Some shareholders sold out or reduced their holdings in a deal that valued WRI at about  400 
million.
''That transaction was based on giving something back to the people who supported us in the early years," said 
Mooney. ''We were very profitable, so it wasn't about putting money into the company; it was a private transaction 
between shareholders."
Summit is still a shareholder in WRI, although its stake was reduced as part of a corporate restructuring in 
2006,when its shares were converted from preference shares to ordinary shares. That was designed as a prelude 
to a flotation, but the deal never emerged. ''We had gone down that road but, at the end of 2007 and beginning of 
last year, the markets were collapsing and it didn't make any sense," said Mooney.
He said the company ''didn't need the cash'' from a listing and had more flexibility as a private firm.
Nolan and Kennedy remain the major shareholders in the business and are on its board, although neither has a 
day-to-day involvement in the firm. The company's other directors are chairman Fintan Drury, former Aer Lingus 
chief financial officer Brian Dunne, and Mark Opzoomer, the former managing director of Yahoo! in Europe.
With the credit crunch continuing, an exit - whether in the form of a flotation or a takeover - seems to be off the 
agenda for now. ''With the markets they way they are now, it is not a market for a deal. And that suits me: that sort 
of stuff is just a distraction," said Mooney.

Dom Crotty is country manager of OPP in Ireland. Operational in the Irish market since 1988, OPP offers 
personality assessment tools and psychometric qualification training.
The company employs 150 staff in Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the US. It has group 
revenues of  25 million. Crotty has been in his role for the past five years. He oversees four OPP associate partners 
in Dublin, Cork and Belfast. What are the main responsibilities of your job?
I am responsible for developing the business in Ireland. I do this by helping new and existing clients to get the 
maximum value from our tools and services, and ensuring that business psychology truly enhances performance.
What are your primary professional motivators?
I enjoy my job tremendously. What gets me out of bed is the faith I have in our products and services. I believe that 
they make a difference to the quality of people's relationships at work - and how they develop as people and 
professionals.
How would you describe your work style?
I learned early that the customer is always right. Building trust and meeting commitments to clients is crucial.
What would you rate as the best decision you have made in business?
Locating the OPP office in the Irish Management Institute (IMI) facility in Sandyford.
Our psychometric tests are used widely on IMI courses. OPP's training and services are also complementary to 
much of what the IMI does, so we all benefit.
What is the most valuable lesson you have learned?
Working Week
Growing up in my family's business, I learned that everything starts with the customer. To be successful in any 
business, it is critical to stay close to your clients, understand their business and, in so doing, anticipate their needs 
and requirements.
That is not an earth-shattering revelation, but it still amazes me to see the number of businesses that start at the 
other end of the supply chain. They develop a product and service first and find later - when they try to sell to the 
market - that there is no demand for it.
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
Like so many others in Irish business, I am a great admirer of Michael O'Leary and the remarkable success story 
that is Ryanair. He understands what the market requires, has been unrelenting in his drive and has a clear and 
consistent business strategy.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
I expect things to be a lot tougher over the next year or so. Clients are understandably very cautious about 
committing to expenditure.
There is also a clear emphasis on securing the best possible value for money.
The two questions I am asked most frequently by clients now are: ''What is this going to do for the top line?" and 
''How much is it going to save me?" It is critical to have a very clear and consistent value proposition to market and 
sell in this environment.
What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?
I hope to steer OPP through the turbulent business conditions that we expect will continue in Ireland over the next 
18 months. Thereafter, I hope we can establish a growth rate steady enough to see the business double in size by 
the end of 2012.

From Mr Matt Andersson.
Sir, Frederick Studemann may be pointing to something more revealing than his cynicism suggests . Airline service 
in the future may indeed more resemble Aeroflot or Ryanair than, say, the high-touch services that Tyler Brûlé 
obsesses over. But the reason is that airlines will eventually provide efficient, ubiquitous public transport where on-
board services are irrelevant and non-existent.
Our current airline model is copied from transoceanic ship travel where durations allowed for a division of services 
from first class to steerage; the long travel times supported entertainment, recreation and amenities. Airline travel is 
similarly and relatively slow, which is why carriers try to compete over lounges, seat pitch, flat beds, movies, food 
and work-support services: you need something to do to kill all the time it takes to get from one place to another.
In the future, rather than taking a day to travel from Chicago to London, hyper-speed aircraft currently in 
development will accomplish the same task in less than an hour. Airport processing will become nearly invisible and 
free-flowing; boarding will be like stepping on and off a commuter train. And there will be only one class: fast. 
Ryanair meets Concorde.

From Prof Patrick Barwise.
Sir, Frederick Studemann describes Soviet-era Aeroflot as a precursor of today's low-cost airlines. I wonder if he 
knows Ryanair's Irish nickname - Eireoflot.

National Express
Stagecoach this week threw its hat into the ring for National Express, the bus and rail operator, after saying it was in 
exclusive talks with the consortium led by Spain's Cosmen family and CVC Capital over a possible break-up.
The transport group, which is run by Brian Souter, also hinted that it might be keen to make a bid of its own for the 
whole of National Express, saying it would "continue to consider all other options" in addition to its talks with the 
Cosmens and CVC.
The intervention of Stagecoach in the tussle for control of National Express promises to turn it into this summer's 
most entertaining takeover.
National Express is in turmoil after its shares lost two-thirds of their value over the past year on the back of heavy 
losses in the company's UK rail division, a £1bn debt pile and the departure of Richard Bowker, its chief executive.
The troubles with the East Coast line pushed the group into the red for the first six months of this year.
The Spanish-led consortium has made any takeover of National Express contingent on the retention of its two other 
franchises - East Anglia and c2c, the London to Tilbury and Southend operation, which Lord Adonis, transport 
secretary, has threatened to take back.
Airlines
More signs that airlines are struggling to stay aloft emerged this week following trading updates at Ryanair, British 
Airways and BAA.
Although Ryanair increased its first-quarter profit thanks to the steep fall in fuel costs, the group warned that full-
year earnings would be towards the lower end of previous guidance as it looks to intensify its price war against rival 
carriers.
The big stories Weekend briefing
Meanwhile, BA reported its first operating loss for the early summer months as its most lucrative long-haul business 
passengers travel less and trade down to cheaper tickets.
The move comes as the struggling UK flag carrier announced plans to eliminate meals - except breakfast before 
10am - on flights lasting less than two-and-a-half hours.
The fall in passenger numbers also weighed on BAA. The UK's largest airports operator revealed interim pre-tax 
losses for the six months to June 30 widened from £135.3m to £545.7m.
Cash calls
Still the cash calls come from companies that overdid it in the good times.
A double blow of declining consumer demand and receding prospects of renewing lending facilities on keen terms 
has prompted a £350m cash call from Rexam, Europe's leading beverage can maker.
This was followed by Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing group, which announced a share placing to raise 
almost £1bn to pay down its £8.4bn debt mountain after the failure of a previous plan to cut borrowings through the 
sale of one of its divisions.

British Airways is in a "fight for survival", according to chief executive Willie Walsh. Yesterday it revealed a pre-tax 
loss of £148m for the past quarter. It is haemorrhaging cash. The desperate condition of the national flag carrier 
provokes one crucial question for the City: what impact will BA's travails have on its corporate entertaining?
Earlier this week BA abolished canapés from long haul and sandwiches from short hops. Will investors and 
corporate travel buyers face the same sumptuary clampdown? Will they be fobbed off with a pretzel and a cup of 
tap water in place of a blow-out at Coq d'Argent? Likely so. An official told Lombard: "Senior management take on 
board what is being done to customers. There will be no exclusive lunches."
BA has been battered by the slump in long haul business travel. In short haul it has suffered from the competition of 
budget airlines, whose profits have been resilient in the face of the recession. Here, BA may increasingly resemble 
Ryanair, only run by a politer Irishman. In a conference call yesterday, Mr Walsh dropped hints about raising 
charges for heavy luggage. He has yet to propose surcharging heavy passengers à la Michael O'Leary.
Fans of BA believe that the bulk of its problems are cyclical. But the airline may be more exposed than they think to 
the phenomenon of business obsolescence that finished off Woolies. The low-cost carriers have exposed how 
much of a commodity air travel is, creating a generation of consumers unwilling to pay extra for a trolley dolly's 
smile. In these circumstances, a business lumbered with such legacy costs as a final salary pension scheme is at a 
distinct disadvantage to rivals that are not. Yesterday, one analyst consoled himself that "the tea and biscuits at 
BA's presentations are laid on by UBS".

Highlight: The budget carrier files for bankruptcy after six years of no profit
Body
Sky Europe, the Bratislava-based low cost carrier, has filed for bankruptcy after failing to make any profit for six 
years.
The carrier has cancelled all of its flights from&Vienna, Bratislava and Prague, leaving customers with no 
compensation. The airline was banned from flying from Vienna due to unpaid landing fees.
The move comes after it emerged in June that SkyEurope owed (EURO)3.1 million ($4.412 million) in social 
insurance to its employees. This was despite the fact the airline received a loan from Bank of Scotland, which is 
now in possession of the aircraft.
At the end of last year, SkyEurope's fleet was reduced to five 737-700s. The aircraft are worth approximately 
$308,112,850 and it is understood that Bank of Scotland will decide within the next week what to do with them.
Austrian Airline AUA, FlyNiki, Smart Wings and CSA Czech Airlines are providing replacement flights. Rival budget 
carrier Ryanair also said it is prepared to help stranded customers.

From Mr Geoffrey E. Nunn.
Sir, While perhaps tongue in cheek, Frederick Studemann's comparison of low-cost Ryanair with communist-era 
Aeroflot, the famously abysmal Russian airline, misses a key point about capitalism ("Pioneers of the Ryanair 
revolution", July 25).
In a well- functioning free market, consumers are provided with a menu of choices, often ranging in quality and price 
to meet every pocketbook. This enables each consumer to obtain the most satisfaction from his scarce income. If 
all airline travel were of the best quality, it wouldn't be good for consumers. Just as it wouldn't be good if all cars 
were built to the quality specifications of a BMW or Mercedes (the rich would ride and the rest of us would walk).
Because Ryanair successfully fills a niche, customers often choose it over competing carriers. That's more than you 
can say for Aeroflot, which owed its existence entirely to its monopoly - creating a captive market.

Drop in premium tickets hits BA , European rivals

As demand for premium class air travel is steadily whittled away by the global recession, British Airways PLC is 
leading moves among European flagship carriers to strip out costly services like onboard meals that had previously 
distinguished them from budget airlines.
BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh, who has warned that the key premium market may never recover, said Friday that 
his cost-cutting ax would swing for some years yet as the airline posted a 94 million pound ($155.5 million) quarterly 
loss.
The economic downturn has hit carriers including BA, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa harder than their low-cost 
rivals like Ryanair and easyJet as cash-strapped individual travelers and companies balk at paying for a seat in first 
or business class, particularly on short-haul flights.
The latest International Air Transport Association figures show that the number of premium ticket holders slumped 
23.6 percent in May the 12th straight month of declines.
Underscoring the extent of the rout, BA's first-quarter operating loss was the first time since the airline was 
privatized in 1987 that it has recorded a deficit at the beginning of the fiscal year.The April to June quarter is usually 
the second strongest earnings period after the summer peak the airline earned a 35 million pound profit in the same 
period a year ago.
Revenue in this year's quarter fell 12 percent. Air France-KLM and Lufthansa fared even worse, reporting falls in 
revenue of 20.5 percent and almost 20 percent respectively and significant losses on Thursday.
In contrast, both easyJet and Ryanair are expected to post full year pretax profits, albeit with Ryanair scaling down 
its forecasts earlier this week to the lower end of its range.
"On short-haul flights, business class is on the way out and might even disappear within the next few years," said 
Panmure Gordon analyst Gert Zonneveld.
Drop in premium tickets hits BA , European rivals
With that awareness growing, full-service carriers are beginning to resemble their low-cost counterparts more than 
ever by taking a page from the low-cost business model and removing perks. BA earlier this week said it is 
scrapping meals in economy class on short-haul flights to save some 22 million pounds each year. It's also 
considering cutting the chocolates and canapes it serves up to business class passengers.
The airline's trans-Atlantic, business-class only subsidiary, Openskies, last week dropped its service between 
Amsterdam and New York and shelved plans to add four more jets serving other European cities by the end of 
2009.
In the United States, some carriers have begun charging for drinks on long-haul flights. Deutsche Lufthansa AG 
announced a &#8264;ion cost-cutting plan on Thursday and while it did not unveil full details, analysts have little 
doubt it will include cutting back on ancillary services like catering or use of credit cards.
Oddo Securities analyst Yan Derocles in Paris said future cost-cutting exercises by big carriers meant that 
customers are likely to find themselves paying for things like changing a ticket that used to be free.
"In terms of service and pricing, they are getting a bit closer to the Easyjet, on short- and medium-haul flights," 
Derocles said. "We will see more and more of this on intra-European flights."
But BA argues that it is a long way from the likes of Ryanair, which charges for onboard refreshments, check-in, 
seat priority and hold baggage, noting that it will still serve breakfast on short-haul flights that take off before 10 a.m.
Zonneveld and Derocles said that the differences between low-cost and full-service airlines would remain sharper 
on long-haul flights, but Zonneveld cautioned that even then there would be "nonstop cost reduction."
Walsh said that BA's its stringent cost plan was already bearing fruit, with a 6.6 percent reduction in operating costs 
since October a result that was welcomed by investors who pushed up BA's shares 6 percent to 142.4 pence.
However, he added that "with revenue still weak, there is much more to be done," including pushing through a plan 
to slash some 3,700 jobs from its 40,000-strong work force and freeze pay for several years. It has also taken 5 
percent of its winter flight capacity out of service.
The staff and pay cuts have met with resistance from unions. BA recently called in a government-backed mediator 
in an attempt to reach a deal and avoid crippling strike action. Walsh said Friday that both sides are currently in a 
"cooling off" period with talks halted.
The carrier's engineers and pilots have accepted a separate deal.
Walsh has also delayed delivery of 12 new superjumbo Airbus A380 aircraft, but declined to comment on the status 
of talks with Boeing Co. over the 24 Boeing 787 jets it ordered in 2007, following a report he was seeking to 
renegotiate installment payments.
"Talks are ongoing and confidential," he told reporters.
In more positive news, BA said it expected its full year fuel bill to be between 450 million pounds and 500 million 
pounds lower. It also said that its debt had fallen slightly to 2.3 billion pounds.

British Airways PLC warned there were "no visible signs of improvement" in the recession-hit airline industry as it 
posted a 94 million pound ($155.5 million) quarterly loss Friday, despite noting a seasonal summer uptick.
BA said it would continue to focus on stripping costs out of the business, reporting that its efforts so far have 
resulted in a 6.6 percent reduction in operating costs since October.
The airline is seeking to slash some 3,700 jobs from its 40,000-strong work force and freeze pay for several years. 
It has also taken 5 percent of its winter flight capacity out of service and even dropped meals on short-haul flights.
The operating loss is the first time since BA was privatized in 1987 that it has recorded a deficit at the beginning of 
the fiscal year, which is usually the second strongest earnings period after the summer peak the airline earned a 35 
million pound profit in the same period a year ago.
Revenue in the fiscal first quarter ending June 30 fell 12 percent to 1.98 billion pounds, from 2.25 billion pounds.
The airline did not provide net profit details in Friday's trading update. Operating earnings exclude financial items 
such as interest and taxes, as well as one-time gains and losses.
With the operating loss and revenue flagged up by the carrier ahead of the announcement, BA stock received a 
boost from the positive news on costs and a reduction in its debt, lifting 4.2 percent to 140 pence.
Chief Executive Willie Walsh said that while traffic volumes were down, they had stabilized during the quarter and 
showed some signs of improvement for the peak summer months.
However, he added that yields, or average fares per mile (kilometer), "remain volatile," leaving the airline wary of 
providing revenue guidance for the full year. Yields dropped 9.7 percent in the first quarter and Walsh said he 
expected a greater fall in the second quarter.
"Trading conditions continue to be very challenging ... and no visible signs of improvement," he said.

Other carriers have also succumbed to the market downturn, with Air France-KLM reporting a 20.5 percent fall in 
first quarter revenue to &#8264;llion and Lufthansa posting an almost 20 percent drop to the same level on 
Thursday.
Even the normally more robust budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC spooked the market earlier this week by 
scaling back its full-year profit forecasts.
Walsh has been one of the most pessimistic airline industry executives about the sector, warning that BA is in a 
"fight for survival" and that the carrier's key premium traffic may never fully recover.
Panmure Gordon analyst James Cooke said that yields are likely to remain under pressure and premium traffic 
weak. He retained his hold recommendation on BA stock.
Walsh said Friday that while BA's efforts to cut costs were bearing fruit, "with revenue still weak, there is much more 
to be done," suggesting the savings plan would last years.
His plans to slash 3,700 ground staff and cabin crew positions have met with resistance from unions. BA recently 
called in a government-backed mediator in an attempt to reach a deal and avoid crippling strike action. Walsh said 
Friday that both sides are currently in a "cooling off" period with talks halted.
The carrier's engineers and pilots have accepted a separate deal.
In other cost-saving measures, BA has stripped capacity out of its flying schedule, with plans to park 22 aircraft over 
the winter. It has also extended its planned delivery of six new superjumbo Airbus A380 aircraft by an average of 
five months. A second round of delivery of six more aircraft will be delayed by an average of two years.
Walsh declined to comment on the status of talks with Boeing Co. over the 24 Boeing 787 jets it ordered in 2007, 
following a report he was seeking to renegotiate installment payments.
"Talks are ongoing and confidential," he told reporters on a conference call.
In more positive news, BA said it expected its full year fuel bill to be between 450 million pounds and 500 million 
pounds lower. It also said that its debt had fallen slightly to 2.3 billion pounds.
Walsh also played down reports that BA is planning to gearing up to sell control of the trans-Atlantic premium 
subsidiary Openskies, which last week dropped its service between Amsterdam and New York, leaving just one 
route between Paris and New York.
Wals told reporters he had nothing to add to existing public comment by the airline that it is "reviewing all aspects of 
its activities."

British Airways PLC reported Friday a record operating loss of 94 million pounds ($155.5 million) for the first quarter 
as people cut down on travel amid the recession, and said there were "no visible signs of improvement" in the 
market beyond a seasonal up-tick for the summer.
BA pledged to continue its focus on stripping costs out of the business. It said expenses, debt and the fuel bill were 
all down over the first quarter.
The loss posted by the airline, which is seeking to trim costs by cutting 3,700 jobs and freezing pay, compares with 
a 35 million profit a year earlier.
It is the first time since the company was privatized in 1987 that it has recorded a deficit at the beginning of the 
fiscal year.
The April to July period is usually the second strongest earnings period after the summer peak the airline earned a 
35 million pound profit in the same period a year ago.
Revenue in the current first quarter fell 12 percent to 1.98 billion pounds, from 2.25 billion pounds.
"Trading conditions continue to be very challenging with underlying revenue down 16.8 per cent and no visible 
signs of improvement," Chief Executive Willie Walsh said in the trading update. "While traffic volumes are down 
considerably compared to last year, they have stabilised during the quarter and show some signs of improvement 
for the peak summer months."
The airline did not provide net profit details in the update.
Walsh said that efforts to cut costs were bearing fruit, with costs down 6.6 percent over the quarter.
"But with revenue still weak, there is much more to be done," he added.
British Airways posts Q1 operating loss
BA has already stripped capacity out of its flying schedule, with plans to park 22 aircraft over the winter. It has also 
extended its planned delivery of six new Airbus A380 aircraft by an average of five months. A second tranche of the 
aircraft will be delayed by an average of two years.
Walsh has been one of the most pessimistic airline industry executives about the sector, warning that BA is in a 
"fight for survival" and that the carrier's key premium traffic may never fully recover.
The normally more robust budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC spooked the market earlier this week by scaling 
back its full-year profit forecasts to the bottom end of its forecast range of 173 million pounds to 259 million pounds.
Walsh's plans to cut costs by slashing 3,700 ground staff and cabin crew positions from its 40,000 strong work force 
and free pay have run into headwinds as talks with unions about the plan have stalled. The carrier's engineers and 
pilots have accepted a separate deal.
In more positive news, BA said it expected its full year fuel bill to be between 450 million pounds and 500 million 
pounds lower.

Charles Stanley questions BA - Iberia merger
Charles Stanley questions BA-Iberia merger
Citywire

Length: 415 words

Charles Stanley's Alastair Nicholson believes a potential British Airways-Iberia merger will not be enough to revive 
British Airways' fortunes, following the ailing airline's gloomy results today.
British Airways' (BA) £148 million pre-tax loss over the three months to the end of June has left two UK equity 
specialists unsurprised. BA's chief executive Willie Walsh said that the firm could not give any solid guidance on 
future revenues, which have already fallen 12.2% year on year, to £2 billion.
Nicholson, who heads up Charles Stanley's Oxford branch, currently has no exposure to BA but has held it in the 
past. He believes too many factors are outside the company's control.
Nicholson said: 'You've got to look at what [Michael] O'Leary has done to the airline world. If he gets his fleet of 
planes across the Atlantic, BA will struggle. What BA needs to attend to is what O'Leary has shown the industry - 
get costs down.'
The threat posed to BA's future earnings by low-cost airlines far outweighs the potential benefits and cost-cutting 
opportunities acquired through a potential merger with Iberia.
He added: 'Going after Iberia for me shows that the company does not know what it is doing. It needs to get costs 
down.'
Nicholson's sentiments are echoed by Julian Fosh, who runs a raft of funds at Liontrust including the Liontrust First 
Growth fund. Fosh does not hold BA, or any other companies in the sector, as he says it does not meet any of his 
three key investment criteria. These include intellectual property, strong distribution channels or significant recurring 
business.
His outlook for the company remains gloomy, as he points to the highly cyclical nature of the stock and the fact that 
a sustained economic recovery looks some way off.
Fosh (above) said: 'When you boil it down, companies have to raise money on the debt or equity markets, engage 
in activity and then make a return on that. For only one year out of 10, BA has made a return in excess of the cost 
of capital. The share is not justifying its existence.'
He believes the arrival of Ryanair and Easyjet 12 years ago has fundamentally changed the industry.
Charles Stanley questions BA - Iberia merger
He said: 'BA is a legacy airline which has the burden of expensive older staff and pensions issues. That is not its 
fault, it is an impossible job. We could get a cyclical upturn and you could buy the stock at the right time and make 
money on the way up. But the company is fighting a structural headwind.'
At 13:36 BA was trading at 141.7p, up 7.4p or 5.5%.

The Dublin Airport Authority has defended itself against allegation from Ryanair that it is partially to blame for the 
airline's decision today to cut flights at the Airport by 20pc.
The DAA said that the recession is to blame for Ryanair's decision to cut capacity.
It adds that it is not clear what proportion of these cuts will actually take place. "Recent experience shows that 
Ryanair announces large cuts in capacity to the media, but subsequently reduces capacity by a much smaller 
amount in reality."
"Last summer (15 July 2008), Ryanair claimed it would cut weekly flights from Dublin by 12pc over the winter of 
2008-2009, whereas the actual capacity cut was 4.2pc. Ryanair announced that it would carry 500,000 fewer 
passengers from Dublin last winter. But in actual fact, the reduction in Ryanair passengers last winter was 150,000. 
These reductions were also due to the economic downturn. In July last year, Ryanair claimed that its passenger 
traffic at Stansted would drop by 900,000 passengers in the winter of 2008-09, but according to BAA, which 
operates Stansted Airport, the reduction in passenger numbers was in reality about 400,000," the DAA said. The 
DAA maintains that Ryanair is cutting capacity from Ireland and Britain because it has previously warned investors 
that declining economic growth in Ireland and the UK is "likely to impact demand for air travel".

The Dublin shares market rose with banks gaining modestly as investors began to digest details on NAMA, 
published a half hour before the market closed.
Shares in AIB climbed 4c to E1.71, Bank of Ireland gained 5c to E1.81 and Irish Life and Permanent rose by 6c to 
E3.26.
While the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, said that the NAMA draft legislation will not be a "bail out" for banks 
or property developers, he said the impaired loans would be transferred to the banks at a "significant discount". 
"NAMA will buy loans from the participating banks at a significant discount - these loans will be from the riskiest part 
of the bank portfolios, the land and development loans, as well as certain associated loans."
"This will take these riskier loan classes away from the balance sheets of the banks concerned and make the banks 
safer and more secure for depositors and investors." The banks' book value of the loans will not be a factor and the 
banks will have to recognise a loss on their books at the time of the transfer for the difference between the book 
value and the amount paid by NAMA. The paper value of property and development loans NAMA is planing to take 
over from the banks is E90 billion, but the current market value is far less. NAMA will pay the banks somewhere 
between those two figures, as it is required to take into account the long-term economic value of the property 
concerned. Ryanair continues to grow in Spain with the announcement of 39 routes to/from the Canary Islands this 
winter but it is making cuts at its Dublin home-turf. It said it plans to cut flights to and from Dublin Airport by 20pc 
this Winter, blaming the Airport's high costs. Compared to winter 2008/09, when Ryanair based 18 aircraft, and 
operated 1,200 weekly flights, Ryanair's Dublin schedule this winter will be cut by 22pc to 14 based aircraft with 
20pc fewer flights at less than 1,000 each week. Ryanair estimates that its Dublin traffic this winter will decline by a 
further 250,000 passengers compared to last winter's figures, as Dublin Airport loses over 2m passengers overall in 
2009. Ryanair's shares edged down 1c to E3.10. HeidelbergCement - one of CRH's competitors - has reported

second quarter 2009 core profits of E446m, down 37pc compared to the same time last year and slightly behind 
consensus of E457m. Sales came in at E3bn, down 22pc, driven by very weak markets in Europe and the US. 
However, emerging markets, such as China, Bangladesh and India, are showing signs of returning to decent 
growth. The decrease in sales volumes slowed from 18.1pc in the first quarter 2009 to 12.9pc in the second quarter. 
Shares in CRH gained 11c to E17.17. United Drug will issue an interim management statement for its third quarter 
tomorrow. Reiteration of full year guidance (adjusted pre-tax profit at least in line with prior year, on a constant 
currency basis) would give the market provide a robust signal in what continues to be a very challenging year for 
the company, Davy said. There are several opposing forces at work at an operational level, and these will likely be 
the main issues up for discussion, it said. Shares in United Drug edged up 1c to E1.89. Dublin-quoted Veris is close 
to selling its property and facilities management businesses. The company said this morning that an "unconnected 
third party" had been given access to do due diligence on the businesses with a view to making a formal offer. The

No-frills carrier, Ryanair, today said it plans to cut flights to and from Dublin Airport by 20pc this Winter, blaming the 
Airport's high costs.
Compared to winter 2008/09, when Ryanair based 18 aircraft, and operated 1,200 weekly flights, Ryanair's Dublin 
schedule this winter will be cut by 22pc to 14 based aircraft with 20pc fewer flights at less than 1,000 each week. 
Ryanair estimates that its Dublin traffic this winter will decline by a further 250,000 passengers compared to last 
winter's figures, as Dublin Airport loses over 2m passengers overall in 2009.
Ryanair said Dublin is one of Ryanair's two most expensive base airports (Stansted is the other).
It added that the charges levied by the Dublin Airport Authority flies in the face of a European trend that is seeing 
airport operators cut charges to attract more travellers. "The Irish Govts E10 tourist tax makes Ireland an 
uncompetitive tourist destination at a time when other European Governments have scrapped their tourist taxes," it 
said. Ryanair said that traffic at Dublin airport is collapsing - down 11pc or 1m fewer passengers in the first half of 
2009 - "under the weight of these high airport fees and this stupid tourist tax". Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said today: 
"In winter 2007 Ryanair had 22 aircraft based at Dublin Airport. Last year we reduced this by 20pc to 18 aircraft and 
this year we're cutting it by a further 20pc to just 14 aircraft. The high and rising costs at Dublin Airport, combined 
with an insanely stupid E10 tourist tax, are devastating tourism here in Ireland. These cuts come just one day after 
Ryanair announced 39 new routes to the Canaries this Winter where the Spanish Government has reduced airport 
fees to zero. Last week Ryanair announced 11 new routes to Oslo airports this winter where again airport fees have 
been substantially reduced." "The response of the Government owned DAA monopoly to this 11pc traffic collapse is 
to seek yet further price increases! The incompetent Irish Aviation Regulator has already proposed that Dublin 
airport charges for 2010 onwards will be "18pc higher" than they would be if the DAA's traffic was not declining. 
Sadly the DAA gets rewarded by the regulator with price increases for its abject failure to grow and stimulate

traffic." "The Irish Government has compounded this tourism collapse by inflicting an insanely stupid E10 tourist tax 
on passengers at Irish airports at a time when the Belgian and Dutch Governments have scrapped their tourist 
taxes and the Spanish and Greek Governments have reduced their airport fees, in some cases to zero. Ryanair 
again calls on the Irish Government to scrap this stupid E10 tourist tax before even further damage is done to Irish

EasyJet founder backs down in battle for growth

EasyJetyesterday forecast a steep fall in profits for the current year to the end of September but signalled an end to 
months of feuding within the board over the pace of the UK-based low-cost airline's growth.
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou - the founder of EasyJet, largest shareholder and a member of the board - has backed 
down in his fight over EasyJet's capacity growth and has accepted the airline's plan for a growth in capacity of 7.5 
per cent a year over the medium term.
It is a lower rate of expansion than EasyJet has pursued in recent years, but higher than that previously sought by 
Sir Stelios, who had isolated himself on the board.
The fleet plan presented yesterday, which Andy Harrison, chief executive, said had been backed unanimously by 
the board, was almost identical with the last plan presented three months ago.
The budget airline said that it expected its fleet to grow from 165 at the end of September 2008 to 181 at the end of 
September this year, including nine aircraft held for sale, and to 207 by the end of September 2012.
Meanwhile, it would deliver "prudent growth and take advantage of the substantial opportunities to take market 
share . . . while maximising margins and delivering positive cash generation".
The airline said it would continue regularly to review the plans "in the light of economic conditions, the market 
opportunities available and the financial strength of the business".
A spokesman for Sir Stelios said he was "comfortable" with the strategy. The recession had not affected passenger 
demand as much as he had feared.
Sir Stelios has gained a new ally on the EasyJet board, however, through the appointment of Bob Rothenberg, 
senior partner in Blick Rothenberg, the accountancy firm, who was nominated directly by him. The appointment of 
Mr Rothenberg was announced alongside a trading statement in which EasyJet said that it expected a fall of up to 
EasyJet founder backs down in battle for growth
80 per cent in underlying pre-tax profits for the 12 months to the end of September to £25m-£50m from £123m a 
year ago.
In spite of the sharp drop in earnings, Mr Harrison said EasyJet expected to be one of the few airlines to make a 
profit this year. The group was gaining market share across Europe and was performing "relatively well in tough 
trading conditions".
Most leading European network carriers have fallen heavily into loss, with both British Airways and Air France-KLM 
facing a second consecutive year of losses.
The two leading European low-cost airlines Ryanair and EasyJet have remained in profit, however, as more air 
travellers trade down and seek lower fares during the deepening recession.
Ryanair, the biggest short-haul carrier in Europe, forecast this week it would more than double its underlying net 
profits in the 12 months to next March.

Move ends months of boardroom feuds
Body
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, EasyJet founder, board member and largest shareholder, has backed down in his fight 
over the airline's future capacity growth.
He has accepted EasyJet's plan for annual growth in capacity of 7.5 per cent for the next five years, ending months 
of feuding with the rest of the board and the airline's management.
It is a lower rate of expansion than EasyJet has pursued in recent years, but higher than that sought by Sir Stelios, 
who had isolated himself in the board.
The fleet forecast was near identical to the plan presented three months ago. Andy Harrison, chief executive, said it 
had been backed unanimously by the board. The airline said it expected its fleet to expand from 165 in September 
2008 to 181 at the end of September 2009, and to 207 by the end of September 2012.
EasyJet said the plan would deliver "prudent growth and take advantage of the substantial opportunities to take 
market share . . . whilst maximising margins and delivering positive cash generation".
EasyJet said it would continue to review the plans regularly "in the light of economic conditions, the market 
opportunities available and the financial strength of the business".
Sir Stelios was said to be "comfortable" with the strategy. The recession had not affected demand as much as he 
had feared.
However, the founder has gained an ally on the board, through the appointment of Bob Rothenberg, senior partner 
in Blick Rothenberg, the accountancy firm. Mr Rothenberg was nominated by Sir Stelios under the terms of rights 
he holds under the company's articles of association.
EasyJet 's founder backs down
EasyJet forecast that profits would fall steeply this year. In an interim management statement for its third quarter 
from April to June, it said it expected a fall of up to 80 per cent in underlying profits for the 12 months to the end of 
September of £25m-£50m, from £123m a year ago.
In spite of the drop Mr Harrison said EasyJet expected to be one of the few airlines to profit this year. It was gaining 
market share across Europe and performing "relatively well in tough trading conditions". The shares closed up 
10¼p at 288p.
Most European network carriers have fallen into the red, with both British Airways and Air France-KLM facing a 
second consecutive year of losses. Ryanair and EasyJet, the leading European low-cost airlines, have remained in 
profit during the recession, as more air travellers trade down.

Sir Stelios benighted as suits prove bolder risk-takers

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has modelled his career as a serial entrepreneur on that of Sir Richard Branson. But it is 
hard to imagine the combative balloonist compromising over a boardroom dispute as resignedly as Sir Stelios just 
has.
The disagreement concerned the impact of the recession on air travel. Sir Stelios, in his younger days a flamboyant 
risk-taker, had pressed apprehensively for EasyJet to freeze capacity in response to the downturn. Disproving 
popular stereotypes, it was the corporate types who now run EasyJet that held their nerve. Having wrangled for 
months with the prince of all things orange, they used yesterday's trading statement to promise a capacity 
expansion of 7.5 per cent annually for the next few years. The fleet will grow by 52 aircraft, as previously expected.
In fairness, Sir Stelios, whose family owns 38 per cent of EasyJet, changed his mind when the facts changed. 
Government intervention averted financial Armageddon, alleviating his worst fears. The chortling Monaco resident 
has meanwhile claimed credit for EasyJet's promise to prioritise a 15 per cent return on capital that will bolster the 
dividend yield. The broader aim is to emphasise differences with cost-cutting, growth-driven Ryanair. EasyJet, you 
understand, is classy cheap rather than just plain cheap.
The airline is entering its mature years alongside its 42-year-old founder. It is a far cry from the harum-scarum early 
days. Then, Sir Stelios, born not so much with a silver spoon in his mouth as a whole canteen of hallmarked cutlery, 
sometimes mucked in to clean the aircraft. He would hardly have intervened so fractiously in EasyJet's growth 
plans had subsequent ventures prospered half so well. Sir Richard may one day fly us to the edge of space. But his 
acolyte has been grounded by a more modest record and his shrewd management by EasyJet's career executives.

Ryanair expands winter services to Canary Islands

Irish budget airline Ryanair announced a major shifting of its winter routes Wednesday to capitalize on Europeans' 
love affair with Canary Islands sunshine.
The Dublin-based carrier said it would launch 39 routes in October linking sun-starved Belgium, Britain, Germany 
and Ireland to the three major Canaries resort islands of Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote. Portugal and 
mainland Spain also are getting new links to the Canaries.
The move represents a challenge to the package holiday operators and chartered airlines that traditionally dominate 
tourist traffic to the Canaries, which lie west off the coast of Morocco. Ryanair is seeking to compete with the 
package operators by offering its own on-line booking services for hotels and rental cars.
As with other recent moves, Ryanair attributed its decision to British and Irish taxes on air passengers, rather than 
the challenges of recession or shifting seasonal demands.
Ryanair's announcement asserted that the airline was moving its aircraft to the Canaries from Britain and Ireland, 
"where passenger taxes damage tourism."
Nonetheless, most of the new routes link the Canaries to both countries: 20 routes to Britain, and four more to 
Ireland.
Last week, Ryanair announced it was withdrawing 16 of its 40 aircraft over the winter period from its biggest base, 
Stansted Airport northeast of London, and planned to make similar winter reductions in its No. 2 base, Dublin. It 
blamed British and Irish tax for that move and made no mention of its Canary Islands plans.
Ryanair pursued its offensive against taxes on another front Wednesday, filing a formal complaint to European 
Union competition authorities against the Irish government over its €10 ($14) tax on air passengers.
Ryanair argued that the tax constitutes illegal state aid to its two main Irish competitors, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann. 
The tax is not imposed on Aer Lingus passengers who use Irish airports to transit between flights, while the 
government levies a lower €2 ($2.80) tax on passengers using the internal Ireland flights of Aer Arann.

LONDON (AP) Low-cost airline easyJet PLC reaffirmed its full-year pretax profit of 25 million to 50 million pounds 
($41 million-$82 million) on Wednesday, despite a "difficult and uncertain" market as the carrier picks up market 
share across Europe.
The carrier added that it is pushing ahead with its plan to target growth in markets from which weaker competitors 
are retreating, locking in positions for when the European economy improves.
"This has been a resilient third quarter and our position has continued to strengthen as we made market share 
gains across Europe," said easyJet Chief Executive Andy Harrison. "easyJet is continuing to perform relatively well 
in tough trading conditions and we expect to be one of the few airlines to make a profit this year."
Coming just days after fellow budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC spooked the market by scaling back its full-year 
profit forecasts, the relatively positive report from easyJet gave airline stocks a boost.
EasyJet shares rose 3.7 percent to close at 288 pence. British Airways stock ended up 2 percent at 130.90 pence, 
while Ryanair shed 2 percent to €3.12.
Ryanair however scaled back its full-year profit forecasts to the bottom end of its forecast 173 million pound to 259 
million pound range
London-based easyJet said total revenue in the April-June quarter, the company's fiscal third, was up 12 percent to 
721 million pounds. Total revenue per seat increased by 10.9 percent, or 4.8 percent on a constant currency basis, 
partly because of the movement of Easter from the fiscal second quarter of 2008 to the third quarter in the current 
year.
Passengers carried increased by 2.9 percent to 11.9 million, with a 12 percent growth in passengers originating in 
mainland Europe.
EasyJet forecasts FY profit, targets more growth
The carrier said it made market share gains across Europe, particularly at London's Gatwick, Milan, Paris and 
Madrid.
It added that more than 75 percent of its available summer seats have been booked, leading it to believe total 
revenue per seat at constant currency in the second half of the year will be at least at the same level as the second 
half of last year.
Second half fuel costs and exchange rates are also expected to be broadly in line with the same period last year.

British Airways cuts short haul free meals

British Airways PLC is scrapping all free meals except breakfast on its short-haul flights as the airline continues to 
trim costs amid a recession-driven downturn in demand for travel.
BA said Wednesday that the decision to cut meals on flights lasting less than two hours would save the airline 
around 22 million pounds ($36 million) each year.
The measure, to be introduced on Monday, adds to cost-saving plans by the carrier that also include proposed 
large-scale job losses and pay cuts.
Passengers on short-haul flights currently usually receive a sandwich. That will be replaced by a bag of nuts or 
other snack, alongside drinks.
The move brings BA closer to low-cost carriers like Ryanair Holdings PLC and easyJet PLC, which charge 
passengers to buy food on board.
But BA stressed it remains a full-service airline, saying breakfast would continue to be served on flights before 
10am.
The airline said it had conducted research before making the change, finding that passengers did not require 
substantial refreshment on flights under two-and-a-half hours.
"When you fly with British Airways, the in-flight catering is top-class and, unlike some other airlines, it is free," it 
said. "It is not unusual to make small changes to avoid waste and save money where it makes sense and it meets 
customers' changing tastes."

British low-cost airline easyJet forecast on Wednesday a full-year pretax profit of 25-50 million pounds despite the 
severe industry downturn, while maintaining its fleet growth plans to 2011.
The carrier said revenues had risen 12 percent to 721 million pounds in the third quarter and, although August 
would be crucial, it was confident of finishing the financial year to the end of September in the black.
The shares, down 1.6 percent this year, entered positive territory for 2009 with a 3.3 percent rise to 287.25 pence 
by 0741 GMT, valuing the business at 1.2 billion pounds.
"This has been a resilient third quarter and our position has continued to strengthen ... we expect to be one of the 
few airlines to make a profit this year," Chief Executive Andy Harrison said in a statement. Irish rival Ryanair 
warned the market earlier in the week that its profits would fall to the lower end of expectations as it slashed fares to 
fill its planes, although its anticipated profit of at least 200 million euros is still well above easyJet's. Full service 
airlines such as British Airways are battling record losses and refusing to give any forecasts. "(EasyJet) is 
performing well given the current economic environment but a sustained downturn could clearly delay a profit 
recovery," Gert Zonneveld, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said in a note. EasyJet said it still planned to have nearly 
200 aircraft by September 2011, up from 177 at end of June this year, in line with growth plans laid out in May. The 
plan included a new figure of 207 aircraft by 2012, and a pledge to grow at 7.5 percent a year for the medium term -
- historically slower than previous years. The carrier has been embroiled in a row with its founder and biggest 
shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou for months over the rate of the airline's expansion, with the entrepreneur arguing 
that the industry downturn should be treated with extra caution. EasyJet said the board - which includes the non-
executive director Stelios - had agreed the current strategy, but would continue to view fleet planning decisions in 
light of market conditions. (C ) Reuters

News In Brief
## Another well-known businessman has sought the protection of the High Court after a bank attempted to seize 
control of a number of properties connected to him and his companies arising from outstanding loans. Dublin 
hotelier Hugh O'Regan has secured court protection for three of his companies - Thomas Read Holdings, 
Dashaven which is redeveloping the Kilternan hotel and sports club in south Co Dublin, and Clubko, which owns No 
8 St Stephen's Green in Dublin. Anglo Irish Bank had sought to take control of properties connected to the 
businessman and his companies in relation to multimillion euro loans to Mr O'Regan's companies. Kieran Wallace 
of KPMG was appointed interim examiner to the three companies at a special court sitting before Mr Justice Vivian 
Lavan on Sunday morning. A hearing of the application to confirm Mr Wallace as examiner will be heard by Mr 
Justice Brian McGovern tomorrow. - Irish Times
## A 21m euro takeover bid that will save up to 250 jobs at SR Technics is expected to be finalised within 10 days, 
writes Anne-Marie Walsh. The takeover by a consortium led by former-Ryanair executive Conor McCarthy will come 
just weeks before the aircraft maintenance firm pulls out of Dublin Airport for Zurich with the loss of 1,135 jobs. It is 
understood that Mr McCarthy, who previously worked for SRT, plans to run a pared-down operation after buying the 
bulk of the operation including its base maintenance, landing gear and auxiliary power units. There are also hopes 
that a further 250 jobs could be saved if the remaining line-maintenance division is sold before the company departs 
on August 31. - Irish Independent
## Accountancy regulators have widened the scope of an inquiry into the work of former Anglo Irish Bank directors 
Sean FitzPatrick, David Drumm and Willie McAteer. Their role, if any, in the management of certain loans made last 
year to a number of "senior personnel" in Anglo will be examined by special investigator John Purcell, a former 
comptroller and auditor general. This investigation is in addition to Garda and other regulatory inquiries into the

Anglo Irish debacle, which culminated in the nationalisation of the bank last January. - Irish Times ## A new 
economic action plan for Dublin is due to be launched today by the four local authorities in the city and county. The 
plan will set out key priorities for developing the city region as a significant hub in the European knowledge 
economy. It will include initiatives like the development of three "economic corridors" - the metro in the north of the 
city, the Naas Road in the west and a southern corridor. The plan also aims to generate a brand for the Dublin city 
region. - Irish Independent ## A total of 277 civil servants, including two assistant secretaries, are to leave under 
the government's new incentivised early retirement scheme, figures released last night show. The Department of 
Finance had previously estimated that up to 3,500 staff in the wider public service could leave under the scheme. 
The figures, released by the Department of Finance, also show that 39 staff in various State agencies have had 
their applications to retire early under the scheme approved. - Irish Times ## AIB has signalled that its search for a 
new chief executive could run well into September as it extended the term of a member of the key committee 
charged with finding a successor to Eugene Sheehy. The bank said yesterday that non-executive director Sean 
O'Driscoll, whose day job is as chief executive of electrical appliances group Glen Dimplex, will delay stepping 
down from the bank's board until next spring. He had originally been due to resign his AIB board seat on September 
6, on the expiry of his thee-year term, because of other business commitments. The bank said yesterday he had 
"agreed to remain on the board for a transitional period in order to assist in the recruitment process for a new group 
chief executive and changeover to new leadership at AIB". - Irish Independent ## 300 staff in radio stations 
Newstalk, Today FM, Dublin's 98 and Spin have been informed that their pay will be cut. Pay for staff earning less 
than 50,000 euro a year will be cut by 5pc, while those earning over 50,000 euro will see a pay reduction of 10pc. It 
is understood the decision was made in light of the downturn in advertising revenue and the downturn in the 
economy. All four stations are owned by Denis O'Brien's Communicorp Group. - RTE ## Dublin City Council is 
opposing plans by Iarnrod Eireann for a 100m euro redevelopment of Tara Street station in Dublin, including the 
construction of a 15-storey office block on the site. The two state bodies are also at loggerheads over the payment 
of development contributions and a levy to fund the Metro North in the event of planning permission being granted. 
An Bord Pleanala yesterday began an oral hearing into Iarnrd Eireann's plans to redevelop the station, the second-
busiest in the country. The semi-State aims to fund the new station through the development of the office block by 
seeking development partners if it obtains planning permission. The development includes a glazed three-storey 
concourse and 10 storeys of office accommodation employing a "grain of rice" or "ship-shape" motif. - Irish Times

No-frills Irish airline, Ryanair, today announced that it will open 39 new routes to/from the Canary Islands this winter 
starting in October.
This will comprise of 16 new routes to Gran Canaria, 15 to Lanzarote and 8 to Tenerife (now 16 in total).
These new routes will bring 2 million new passengers, create 2,000 new jobs and deliver a visitor spend of over 
E386m for the Islands, it said.
"Ryanair's big expansion in the Canary Islands is due to "zero" tourist taxes in Spain and the 100pc discount on 
airport charges this winter. This contrasts with the route cutbacks Ryanair has announced in the UK and Ireland 
where airport charges at Dublin and Stansted are increasing and the Irish and UK Governments have imposed 
suicidal tourist taxes of E10 and £10 respectively," it said.

Ryanair today said it is taking a German travel company to court in Ireland for "screenscraping" - selling Ryanair 
flights on its Website.
It is the first of a number of Irish High Court actions Ryanair intends to bring over the coming weeks against the 
other European unauthorised screenscrapers, it warned.
The Irish no-frills airline alleges that the German firm - Travelviva - has also refused Ryanair's offer of licensed 
access to Ryanair.com's flight information for price comparison purposes, which, in Ryanair's belief, "suggests that 
Travelviva's real intention is to continue its unauthorised screenscraping and overcharging of consumers".
Ryanair's Daniel de Carvalho said: "Ryanair is determined to continue its crusade against screenscraping ticket-tout 
websites until the last screenscraper stops overcharging unsuspecting consumers and breaching Ryanair's 
copyright and terms of use of ryanair.com. In recent weeks we have written to various consumer protection and 
competition agencies in Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the UK, calling on them to 
investigate the abusive and anti-consumer practices of these unauthorised screenscrapers. At the same time we 
are pursuing legal actions in Dublin to protect Ryanair's copyright and other rights. We are confident that 
unauthorised screenscraping and overcharging of consumers will eventually be outlawed throughout Europe, to the 
benefit of consumers and legitimate businesses."

Weak trading volumes underpinned activity on the Dublin shares market with the ISEQ following the world's

The ISEQ closed 12.62 points lower at 2,758.07.
As the Cabinet met to finalise the complicated legal structure of NAMA, banks lead this morning's fall. AIB shares 
were down 1c to E1.70, Bank of Ireland rose by 1c to E1.77 and Irish Life and Permanent declined by 6c to E3.06.
Reports suggest that the NAMA legislation could be published on the Department of Finance's website on 
Thursday. While it will be complex - running to over 150 pages - it will still not give details of what the discount at 
which it will buy the impaired property assets will be, which is the key piece of information for which the market is 
waiting, according to Davy. The government will finalise its formula for valuing the loans in the coming weeks before 
sending it to Brussels for approval. But it was the world stage that investors were most concerned about. U.S. 
consumer confidence fell more than expected in July, the Conference board said, recording its second consecutive 
decline as sentiment remained hampered by a difficult job market. The Conference Board, an industry group, said 
its index of consumer attitudes slid to 46.6 in July from 49.3 in June. Better than expected results from supplements 
and nutrition business, NBTY, sparked a 15pc share price advance in the US market yesterday (July 27th). The 
business, a proxy for the sector in which Glanbia's Optimum Nutrition operates, continued to report promising 
same-store sales in its retail operations on both sides of the Atlantic. Shares in Glanbia fell by 2c to E2.30. 
Goodbody's are cutting their full year earnings per share forecast for Ryanair by 18pc after yesterday's first quarter 
results from the airline. Weaker yield guidance for the second quarter and paring back ancillaries revenue growth 
per passenger combined knocks E119m (-4pc) from the broker's full year revenue estimates. On the cost side,

merchanting volumes - the key market for Ireland's Grafton. According to the BMF, volumes in June 2009 were 
16.4pc lower than June 2008. Taking the April-to-June quarter (calendar second quarter) as a better gauge of 
underlying trends, volumes were 17.9pc lower than the second quarter of 2008. Shares in Grafton gained by 6c to 
E2.98 nevertheless. Interestingly, the quarterly year-on-year rate of decline peaked at over 25pc in February (that is 
December to February) and has fallen in the four months since then, Davy said. Shares in CRH dropped by 5c to 
E16.75 and Kingspan edged up 4c to E4.44.

"If Hitler invaded hell," Winston Churchill once remarked, "I would make at least a favourable reference to the Devil 
in the House of Commons." Ryanair views the downturn in much the same way. "Even during deep recessions," 
chief executive Michael O'Leary crowed yesterday, Ryanair "continues to deliver growth". While other European 
airlines are losing money and having to cut back on routes, the low-cost carrier is expanding capacity, slashing 
ticket prices to fill seats. Everyone is hurting in the tough times. But Ryanair's higher-cost competitors are hurting 
more.
This should make Ryanair, already Europe's largest airline by market capitalisation, a recession winner. Expanding 
through the downturn will allow it to increase market share which it can, then milk when the recovery comes. It is a 
credible theory, yet not without risks. In the first quarter, Ryanair carried 11 per cent more passengers than it did in 
the same period last year. But in spite of the rise in traffic, ticket sales of EUR609m were 3 per cent less. Indeed, if 
it wasn't for the EUR152m fall in fuel costs and the EUR165m of ancillary revenues - which includes the penalties 
passengers are charged for extra bags or failing to check-in online - Ryanair would have lost money, instead of 
earning EUR123m.
Investors are willing to tolerate lower profits now if it means higher profits later - but only up to a point and at the 
right price. They took fright after Mr O'Leary warned that lower fares per passenger meant that full-year profits 
would come in at the bottom end of his forecast EUR200m-EUR300m range; Ryanair's share price dropped by 9 
per cent. Even so, Ryanair shares still trade on almost 20 times the new forecast earnings. Looking cheap and 
being cheap are not the same thing.

Ryanair, Europe's largest short-haul airline, is intensifying its price war against rival carriers, and warned that this 
would hold back its profit rise this year.
Its share price fell 9 per cent or 32 cents to close at EUR3.05 in Dublin as it said full-year earnings would be at the 
lower end of previous guidance.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the full-year outlook to March 2010 remained "cautious".
Average fares would be "significantly lower than last year, at or even slightly above the minus 15 to 20 per cent 
range previously guided".
Net profits would be "towards the lower end" of the EUR200m-EUR300m (£170m-£260m) range previously forecast 
but still more than double last year's EUR105m before exceptional charges.
The Irish low-cost airline is cutting fares both to fill seats in its growing fleet and to capture market share.
Its average fare level fell   13 per cent year-on-year in its first quarter from April to June.
In contrast to most traditional carriers, Ryanair is taking advantage of its position as a low-cost airline to expand.
Passenger numbers rose 11 per cent year-on-year from 15m to 16.5m in the June quarter, and the group said it 
was on course to lift passenger numbers by 15 per cent from 58m to 67m in the year to March.
Ryanair staged a turnround in the first quarter from a pre-tax loss of EUR90.5m a year ago to a pre-tax profit of 
EUR134.6m. Fuel costs fell 42 per cent to EUR214m. Aer Lingus It had a further EUR13.5m writedown on its 29.8 
per cent Aer Lingus stake, on top of last year's EUR93.6m writedown.
Excluding one-off charges, pre-tax profits rose from EUR21m to EUR148.1m. Operating profits before exceptional 
items rose from EUR25.7m to EUR154.7m.
Fares dogfight set to hold back Ryanair profit growth this year
Turnover was virtually unchanged at EUR774.7m, down from EUR776.9m a year ago, as the 13 per cent drop in 
yields exceeded the 11 per cent rise in passenger numbers.

News analysis
While other airlines shrink operations the Irish carrier is seizing the initiative, writes Kevin Done
Body
Already deep into the recession, Ryanair, the low-cost and low-fare leader in the European airline industry, is 
showing no sign of being forced to abandon its contrarian strategy.
Most airlines are shrinking - removing flights, cutting capacity and grounding aircraft. They face falling revenue, 
mounting losses and shrinking cash piles. Many, including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and British Airways, have 
had to come to the capital markets for more cash.
But Ryanair has by far the lowest cost base and can therefore act differently.
It is adding aircraft and has recently concluded a $1.5bn (£910m) deal with a syndicate of three banks, backed by 
US Ex-Im Bank guarantees to finance another 55 Boeing jets. It is opening new operating bases and new routes. 
Profits are rising again after a tough 12 months when it was hit by record oil prices.
It is leading the charge to cut fares - in order to fill seats and grab market share - and it is loving it.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the group would be the only big European airline "to deliver 
passenger and profit growth in the current year. The winners in a deep recession will always be those companies, 
such as Aldi, Lidl, McDonald's and Ryanair, who offer lowest prices."
Most of the group's competitors have recently reported declining traffic, falling yields and substantial losses. "This is 
accelerating the pace of airline closures and consolidations," Mr O'Leary said. In recent weeks SkyEurope has 
sought bankruptcy protection in the Slovak courts and MyAir has ceased operations in Italy.
Ryanair sees opportunities in rivals' distress
Mr O'Leary continued to rail yesterday against UK aviation taxes and the high level of charges at BAA's Stansted 
airport, its biggest base in Europe, but the Irish carrier is becoming less dependent on the UK, still its biggest single 
market with 30 per cent of its passengers.
It has become a truly pan-European operator - to a greater extent than any other airline - with 33 bases and more 
than 850 routes. Already Italy is its second-largest market, accounting for 17 per cent of passengers, with Spain 
accounting for 14 per cent.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair, already Europe's biggest short-haul airline, continued "to see enormous opportunities to 
grow our business". He said it was being "besieged" by European airports offering cut-price deals to attract Ryan-
air services, as it was one of the few airlines growing in the recession.
It is expected to announce a batch of new routes this week. However, profit gains in the first quarter were driven by 
lower fuel prices.
A year ago the group was unhedged while oil prices were surging to record levels. It has taken full advantage of the 
subsequent oil price fall and has also locked in the lower prices for this year by extensive hedging. Its full-year fuel 
bill saving could be EUR460m (£397m).
Most ominously for rival airlines, Mr O'Leary warned fuel and other cost savings would be used to fund "continuous 
fare reductions". Average fares for the full year could fall 20 per cent to make sure the airline was filling its growing 
fleet.
It appears that Mr O'Leary is not taking his foot off the throttle - or off the neck of his competitors.

Sharp fall in fuel costs provides fillip
Full-year earnings 'to be at lower end'
Body
Ryanair, Europe's largest short-haul airline, increased its first-quarter profits strongly thanks to the steep fall in fuel 
costs and said it was to intensify its price war against rival carriers.
Its share price fell by nine per cent or 31 cents, however, to close at EUR3.08, as it warned full-year earnings would 
be towards the lower end of previous guidance because of big cuts in air fares.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said the group's outlook for the full year to March 2010 remained 
"cautious".
Average fares would be "significantly lower than last year - at, or even slightly above, the minus 15 to 20 per cent 
range previously guided". Net profits would be "towards the lower end" of the EUR200m-EUR300m ($284m-$426m) 
range previously forecast - but still more than double last year's EUR105m before exceptional charges.
The Irish low-cost airline is cutting fares drastically during the recession both to fill seats in its still rapidly increasing 
fleet and to capture market share. Its average fare level fell by 13 per cent year-on-year in its first quarter from April 
to June.
Lufthansa - Europe's biggest aviation group measured by turnover - admitted the scale of the price war it faced and 
said it was experiencing a "massive" slide towards cheaper tickets.
Roland Busch, finance and personnel director for the Lufthansa airline division, told staff the airline had been 
affected by an "enormous" loss of market share everywhere in Germany and in particular away from its main 
Frankfurt and Munich hubs.
Ryanair raises profits amid price war
In stark contrast to most traditional network carriers, which are shrinking and suffering increasing losses during the 
worst of the recession, Ryanair is taking advantage of its position as the lowest cost producer to continue to 
expand, adding routes around Europe.
Passenger numbers rose by 11 per cent year-on-year from 15m to 16.5m in the three months from April to June. 
The group was on track to increase passengers by 15 per cent from 58m to 67m in the current year to the end of 
March. Ryanair staged a big turnround in the first quarter from a pre-tax loss of EUR90.5m a year ago to a pre-tax 
profit of EUR134.6m. Fuel costs fell by 42 per cent to EUR214m.
A year ago it was affected by exceptional charges of EUR111.5m with a EUR93.6m writedown on its 29.8 per cent 
shareholding in rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus and a EUR17.9m accelerated depreciation charge on sale of older 
aircraft. In the latest quarter it had a EUR13.5m writedown on Aer Lingus.
Excluding one-off char-ges, pre-tax profits jumped from EUR21m to EUR148.1m. Operating profits before 
exceptional items rose from EUR25.7m to EUR154.7m.
Turnover was nearly stable at EUR774.7m, down from EUR776.9m a year ago, as a 13 per cent drop in yields 
exceeded the 11 per cent rise in passengers. Non-fare revenues from sources such as commission earnings on 
hotel, travel insurance and car rental bookings rose by 13 per cent to EUR165.3m.

Alitalia shareholders yearn for some tender loving care

A little more than six months on from the rescue of Alitalia by a consortium of Italian entrepreneurs, the customer 
experience at the Italian flag carrier seems firmly stuck on the ground.
Italian media reports claim that one in three of the airline's flights out of its hub at Rome's Fiumicino airport are 
delayed. This does nothing to dispel the stubborn reputation for poor punctuality spelled out in an adaptation of its 
name during the years of state ownership - "Always late in take-off, always late in arriving".
Rocco Sabelli, chief executive, can point to the dire state of the industry as a first line of defence half a year into his 
captaincy. Never has the sector - from low-cost Ryanair to premium-price British Airways - been battered by so 
much turbulence as it is today.
He can also claim that Alitalia's load factors have improved markedly since the dark days last year when 
passengers feared the company would not survive to honour their tickets by the time they had struggled to check in.
Alitalia's Fiumicino base is far from the ideal home for the newly resuscitated carrier. Macquarie, the Australian 
infrastructure investor, must still be counting its blessings after its near half share of Fiumicino's Aeroporti di Roma 
parent company was bought out in 2007 at top dollar. The Australians had struggled fruitlessly for years to convince 
their Italian partners to invest in long-overdue upgrades. Meanwhile, millions of travellers who have struggled in and 
out of the airport since then will have some sympathy for anyone trying to piece together a service under such 
circumstances.
But Mr Sabelli will have to do better than just listing everyone else's faults if he is to emerge as a credible chief at 
Alitalia. When the CAI consortium that employs him took over the best bits of the old Alitalia, he was eager to 
position himself centre stage as the man with the plan - the "Phoenix" plan, to be precise. His desire for control was 
apparently all the greater since his former boss at scooter maker Piaggio, the entrepreneur Roberto Colaninno, had 
emerged as a big CAI shareholder and later as chairman of the new Alitalia.
But rumours have surfaced in recent weeks that Mr Sabelli's style is rubbing his 20 or so entrepreneur shareholders 
and 25 per cent partner Air France-KLM up the wrong way. While he has reportedly made it known in Alitalia that 
Alitalia shareholders yearn for some tender loving care
his business plan is more or less on track, suggestions that he could be replaced hint that a gap may be opening 
between the chief executive and a group of owner shareholders, who expect to be kept constantly in the loop. 
Having stumped up more than EUR1bn ($1.4bn) to finance his trip, some of these shareholders might say they 
have earned that right.
Mr Colaninno, who gave Mr Sabelli the operational room he insisted on, seems so far to have been able to keep 
any shareholder concerns in check. Corrado Passera, the head of Intesa-Sanpaolo, the Italian bank that backed Mr 
Sabelli's chief executive campaign, has also supported him publicly by insisting that 30 years of mismanagement 
cannot be turned round in a few months.
That said, Mr Sabelli might do well to remember that it is precisely when times are tough - for whatever reason - 
that owners as well as passengers require all the tender loving care that can be mustered. Of the two, owners 
require it the most, particularly if results are slow in coming.
Many passengers denied due care and attention will probably still travel - all the more when the choice of 
alternative carriers is pretty limited. Insufficiently pampered owner-investors have what passengers can only dream 
of - the ability to deploy the ejector seat to make way for a pilot with perhaps a keener sense of who is really paying 
for the ticket.
Irish confession 
Willie Walsh, BA's Irish chief executive, has agreed to work for free this month and forgo his annual bonus this year 
given the dire situation in the airline industry.
The bishop of Killaloe, also called Willie Walsh, has followed his namesake's example by reducing the annual 
salary of the 120 priests in Ireland's second-biggest diocese by about 10 per cent.
He recently confessed on the radio that the Roman Catholic diocese had lost millions of euros as a result of the 
crash in the value of its investments in Irish bank shares. At their peak these were worth about EUR9m but their 
value has since collapsed to EUR2m.
The bishop candidly confessed that he thought bank shares were one of the safest places to invest legacies left to 
the diocese. They were clearly not. Dublin was forced to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank and inject EUR7bn into the 
Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks to prop them up.

Irish shares made modest gains in early trade this morning, in line with international trends.
A short time ago. the ISEQ index was up 11.64 points at 2,782.31.
Several big name shares were the main reason for the rise, with Ryanair bouncing 14c higher to 322 after its drop 
yesterday on a reduced profit forecast.
Drug maker Elan was up 3c to 543, and distribution group DCC had advanced by 14c to 1530. The gains were held 
in check by a 7c drop by CRH to 1717 and a 5c dip by bakery group Aryzta to 2450. The two big banks were 
unchanged, with AIB on 171 and Bank of Ireland at 175. Irish Life and Permanent was 11c higher, however, at 322.

Ryanair profit jumps on lower costs; outlook cut
Ryanair profit jumps on lower costs; outlook cut

Body
Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC reported surging first-quarter profits Monday, citing sharply lower fuel 
costs and a business model that thrives during recession. The company slashed its profit outlook, however, causing 
shares to slump.
The carrier said net profit for the three-month period ending June 30 was €136.5 million ($194.5 million) compared 
to €21 million in the same quarter of 2008.
Sales were virtually flat at €774.7 million ($1.1 billion) versus €776.9 million a year ago. But fuel costs fell 41.6 
percent to €214.1 million.
Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley said Ryanair would discount average fares "precipitously" in coming 
months to keep its aircraft as full as possible. This would allow Ryanair to maximize the revenue it gets from car 
and hotel bookings, luggage charges, credit-card fees and on-board sales.
Cawley narrowed Ryanair's forecast of full-year net profit to a range between €200 million and €250 million. Ryanair 
previously guided that net profits could reach €300 million.
Investors dumped Ryanair stock on the news. The shares fell 8.5 percent to close at €3.08 on the Irish Stock 
Exchange.
Monday's stronger net figures versus 2008 reflected lower write-off costs for depreciating assets. Ryanair recorded 
no write-downs on the value of its fleet in the first quarter of 2009, versus a €17.9 million charge for aircraft 
disposals in the year-ago quarter.
The company continued to record paper losses over its hostile takeover bid for Aer Lingus. Ryanair's nearly 30 
percent shareholding in its loss-making Irish rival cost it €13.5 million in the first quarter of 2009, reflecting 
continued falls in the Aer Lingus share price, compared to a €93.6 million loss in the same period a year ago.
In both cases, accounting rules require Ryanair to record its stock market losses as actual, even though Ryanair 
has not sold any of its depressed Aer Lingus stake and remains committed to taking eventual control. To prevail, 
Ryanair profit jumps on lower costs; outlook cut
Ryanair must persuade the Irish government, the No. 2 shareholder, to sell its 25.4 percent stake and overcome 
regulatory hurdles.
Ryanair said it would keep expanding routes and bases, notably in Norway and Portugal. It also will accelerate its 
policy of trimming winter routes at its two biggest bases, London Stansted and Dublin, and shift aircraft to operate 
seasonal routes from other European hubs.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair expects to carry 67 million passengers in the current fiscal year, up 
15 percent.
But to achieve this, he said Ryanair would cut average fares 15 percent to 20 percent in the current July-September 
quarter, and more than 20 percent for the fiscal year as a whole.
"Ryanair will be the only major European airline to deliver passenger and profit growth in the current year. ... We will 
continue to expand as others fail," O'Leary said in a statement.

Body
An 8.77pc fall in Ryanair's shares after its latest update to the markets helped push the ISEQ index more than 30 
points lower this morning.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 31.50 points to 2,771.69.
Shares in no-frills airline, Ryanair, fell by 30c to E3.07 after it said profit for the full year would be at the lower end of 
a previous range. It reported that its net profit rose by 550pc in the first three months of its financial year to 
E136.5m, slightly beating market expectations. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the results were distorted by a 
42pc reduction in the airline's fuel bill. Revenue for the quarter to the end of June was flat compared with the same 
period last year at E775m. Costs excluding fuel fell by 5pc. Passenger numbers in the period rose by 11pc to 16.6 
million, which Mr O'Leary attributed to a 13pc fall in average fares. Ancillary revenues - which include items such as 
on-board sales, baggage fees and priority boarding charges - rose by 13pc to E165.3m.
Weekend reports say that the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, will meet senior executives from the UK banks 
on July 29th to discuss NAMA. While NAMA legislation, which will possibly be published on July 29th or 30th, will 
be drafted in a way that does not preclude overseas lenders being involved, the conditions for inclusion will be 
sufficiently arduous as to effectively eliminate them from participating, said Davy analyst, Scott Rankin. Sahres in 
AIB fell by 3c to E1.69, Bank of Ireland dropped by 4c to E1.70 while Irish Life and Permanent managed to gain by 
4c to E3.20 after losses last week. Shares in CRH dropped 8c to E17.42. For the six months to end of June CRH 
has already reported that its European Distribution business (which makes up about 13pc of group profits) recorded 
like for like sales of minus 10pc, resulting in a 30pc decline in profits with DIY being the most robust part of the 
business. However, the market environment was more difficult for its US Distribution business (4pc of group profits), 
which has led to a 20pc decline in like for like sales and a breakeven out-turn at the profit level (versus profit of 
dollar 44m in the first half of 2008). "An area of continuing concern is non-residential markets (as alluded to by 
Ryanair shares push ISEQ 30 points lower ISEQ Down
Wolseley), a segment which represents almost 40pc of group EBITDA for CRH," said Goodbody Stockbrokers. UK 
group, Wolseley has reported that sales in UK/Ireland continue to deteriorate, driven by an accelerating decline in 
UK commercial markets and challenging market conditions in Ireland. Shares in Grafton fell by 8c to E2.90.

CRH has already reported that its European Distribution business (which makes up about 13pc of group profits) 
recorded like for like sales of minus 10pc, resulting in a 30pc decline in profits with DIY being the most robust part 
of the business. However, the market environment was more difficult for its US Distribution business (4pc of group 
profits), which has led to a 20pc decline in like for like sales and a breakeven out-turn at the profit level (versus 
profit of USD44m in the first half of 2008). "An area of continuing concern is non-residential markets (as alluded to

UK group, Wolseley has reported that sales in UK/Ireland continue to deteriorate, driven by an accelerating decline 
in UK commercial markets and challenging market conditions in Ireland. Shares in Grafton fell by 6c to E2.92. 
Shares in C and C gained 12c to E2.09. The latest Nielsen data for cider for the four weeks to July 11th showed

cider was surprising with sales flat for the period. Heineken's Bulmers saw sequential gains for the month of 14.8pc, 
especially for pear (+25.9pc), but also for cider (+6.5pc). Pricing trends indicate that C and C is pushing hard on 
margins, with Heineken going exactly the opposite way, Goodbody Stockbrokers said.

A 9.4pc fall in Ryanair's shares after its latest update to the markets helped push the ISEQ index more than 30 
points lower today.
The ISEQ fell by 32.52 points to 2,770.67.
Shares in no-frills airline, Ryanair, fell by 32c to E3.05 after it said profit for the full year would be at the lower end of 
a previous range. It reported that its net profit rose by 550pc in the first three months of its financial year to 
E136.5m, slightly beating market expectations. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said the results were distorted by a 
42pc reduction in the airline's fuel bill. Revenue for the quarter to the end of June was flat compared with the same 
period last year at E775m. Costs excluding fuel fell by 5pc. Passenger numbers in the period rose by 11pc to 16.6 
million, which Mr O'Leary attributed to a 13pc fall in average fares. Ancillary revenues - which include items such as 
on-board sales, baggage fees and priority boarding charges - rose by 13pc to E165.3m.
Weekend reports say that the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, will meet senior executives from the UK banks 
tomorrow (Wednesday) to discuss NAMA. While NAMA legislation, which will possibly be published on July 29th or 
30th, will be drafted in a way that does not preclude overseas lenders being involved, the conditions for inclusion 
will be sufficiently arduous as to effectively eliminate them from participating, said Davy analyst, Scott Rankin.

No frills carrier Ryanair has posted a better-than-expected 550pc rise in first quarter profit thanks to a large 
reduction in fuel costs.
It has said, however, that its outlook remains cautious for the rest of the year.
Ryanair, now one of the world's biggest airlines by market value, said net profit for the three months to June 30 
came in at 136.5m euro.
That compares with 132m euro on average expected by three analysts surveyed by Reuters. "Thanks to a 13 
percent reduction in average fares we grew traffic by 11 percent, a robust performance in a deep recession, when 
many of our competitors were cutting flights, losing traffic and reporting increased losses," chief executive Michael 
O'Leary said in a statement this morning. While rivals exposed to the weak premium sector shrink in the face of 
falling demand, Ryanair is hoping to mop up business from cost-conscious travellers during the global recession. 
Europe's biggest low-cost airline reduced profit forecasts towards the lower end of the 200-300 million euro 
previously guided for the year to March 2010. That compares to rival airlines BA and Virgin which are both expected 
to make heavy losses. O'Leary said Q2 yields -- the industry's main yardstick measuring average revenue per mile 
per customer -- will be significantly lower than last year, at or slightly above the minus 15 to 20 percent range 
previously guided for the carrier's key profitable quarter. "Traffic growth is strong but at much weaker yields due to 
the recession and the impact of tourist tax in Ireland and the UK. We have limited visibility beyond the next two 
months but expect passengers to be very price sensitive for the rest of the year," O'Leary said. The Dublin-based 
airline, which had already taken a hedge for 90 percent of its fuel needs for the first three quarters of 2010 and 5 
percent for Q4, further hedged for 60 percent of fuel for Q4 at an average USD 610 per tonne. O'Leary, who said 
Q1 results were distorted by a 42 percent reduction in fuel costs, added that should Ryanair hedge the balance of 
FY2010 fuel at USD 620 per tonne, it would give full year fuel cost saving of around 460m euro. (c) Reuters

(RTTNews) - Monday, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported a profit in its first 
quarter of fiscal 2010, compared to prior year's loss, helped by lower exceptional costs. On an adjusted basis, profit 
rose from last year. Looking ahead, the company said its outlook remains cautious for the remainder of the fiscal 
year, and that it currently projects full-year net profit towards the lower end of the previous forecast range. The 
shares are currently trading down around 9% on the London Stock Exchange.
First-quarter profit was 123 million euros or 8.31 euro cents per share, compared to loss of 90.5 million euros or 
6.11 euro cents per share last year. The latest quarter results included exceptional items of 13.5 million euros, 
compared to prior year's 111.5 million euros.
Excluding exceptional items, adjusted profit was 136.5 million euros or 9.23 euro cents per share, compared to 21 
million euros or 1.41 euro cents per share in the same quarter a year earlier.
Pre-tax profit was 134.6 million euros, compared to loss of 90.5 million euros last year, while adjusted profit before 
tax surged to 148.1 million euros from 21.0 million euros a year earlier.
In the quarter, total operating revenues declined slightly to 774.7 million euros from 776.9 million euros in the same 
period a year ago. The company noted that an 11% rise in traffic was offset by a 13% decline in average fares. 
Total number of passengers were 16.6 million, up from 15.0 million in the previous year.
Scheduled revenues fell to 609.4 million euros from 630.1 million euros last year, while ancillary revenues grew 
13% to 165.3 million euros from 146.8 million euros a year ago.
Unit costs fell 26% in the quarter due to lower fuel prices and reductions in staff, airport and handling costs.
Commenting on the results, Ryanair's Chief Executive Officer, Michael O'Leary, said, "These quarterly results are 
distorted by a 42% reduction in fuel costs. Thanks to a 13% reduction in average fares we grew traffic by 11%, 
which was a robust performance in a deep recession, when many of our competitors were cutting flights, losing 
traffic and reporting increased losses. Our Net Profit Margin rose to an industry leading 18% and our balance sheet 
was strengthened as cash balances rose to ?2.5bn at the quarter end."
Looking ahead, Ryanair said its outlook remains cautious for the remainder of the fiscal year. Traffic growth is 
strong but at much weaker yields due to the recession and the impact of tourist tax in Ireland and the UK.
Ryanair Turns To Profit In Q1; Cautious On Outlook; Shares Down On LSE
The company has limited visibility beyond the next two months but expect passengers to be very price sensitive for 
the rest of the year. Ryanair added that it remains on track to deliver traffic growth of 15% to 67 million passengers.
Unit costs, excluding fuel, are projected to fall by approximately 5%, and fuel costs will also be substantially lower 
thanks to its renewed hedging program, while these fuel and other cost savings are projected to be used to fund 
continuous fare reductions.
Ryanair added that it expects second-quarter yields will be significantly lower than last year, at or even slightly 
above the minus 15% to 20% range previously guided. Based on the yield performance in first half, the company 
said it expects the full year yield decline will be at or slightly more than minus 20% and accordingly, the company's 
full-year net profit will be towards the lower end of the previously guided 200 million euros to 300 million euros 
range.
RYAAY closed Friday's regular trading session at $29.78, down $0.61, on a volume of 542 thousand shares.
RYA.L is currently trading at 3.0825 euros on the London Stock Exchange, down 0.2925 euros or 8.67%, on a 
volume of 9 million shares.

(RTTNews) - The European markets rose on Monday, as mining and energy stocks gained after copper and crude 
oil prices advanced on speculation that demand will rise on a global economic recovery.
In economic news, the U.S. Commerce Department said in its report that new home sales jumped 11% to an 
annual rate of 384,000 in June from the revised May rate of 346,000. Economists had expected sales to rise to 
352,000 from the 342,000 originally reported for the previous month.
Crude for September delivery rose $0.09 to $68.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, by the time the 
European markets closed.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of pan-European blue chips closed 0.46% higher at 911.58 points, while the narrower 
DJ Stoxx 50 index rose 0.63% to 2,262.41 points.
Around Europe, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index surged up 0.21% to 4,586.13, while France's CAC 40 index rose 0.18% 
to 3,372.36 and Germany's DAX index climbed 0.42% to 5,251.55.
Mining stocks rose after copper prices rallied to a nine-month high in London. BHP Billiton, the world's biggest 
miner, rose 1.5%, while Xstrata, the world's fourth largest copper producer, added 1.4% and Antofagasta, which 
owns copper mines in Chile, climbed 2.3%.
Heavily weighted oil stocks rose after crude oil prices advanced. BP, Europe's biggest oil company, surged up 
1.6%, while Royal/Dutch Shell, the second biggest, added 1.2% and Total, the third biggest, gained 0.7%.
Pearson, the owner of the Financial Times newspaper, jumped 12.1% after the company reported an increase in 
first-half adjusted earnings and confirmed its adjusted earnings forecast for the full year.
Lloyds Banking Group, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, climbed 6.9% after the Sunday Telegraph reported that 
the company is considering selling part or all of its Bank of Scotland joint ventures unit.
On the other hand, Ryanair Holdings, Europe's largest low-cost airline, dropped 8.5% after the company said full 
year earnings will be at the low end of its forecast.

(RTTNews) - Stocks remain mostly negative in early afternoon trading on Monday after profit taking stymied a rally 
seen on the heels of the release of new home sales data earlier. The major averages are all in negative territory by 
modest margins, giving back a small portion of their recent gains.
With new home prices moving back to the downside, the Commerce Department released a report showing that 
new home sales in the month of June increased by much more than economists had been anticipating. New home 
sales jumped by 11 percent, the sharpest increase in nearly nine years.
In earnings news, RadioShack (RSH), Tellabs (TLAB) and Corning (GLW) reported earnings that beat Wall Street 
estimates, while Verizon Communications (VZ) and Honeywell (HON) announced results that were in-line with 
expectations. Aetna (AET), however, was one of the major firms whose quarterly earnings fell well short of 
consensus.
The major averages are currently stuck below the unchanged line, although they are well off their worst levels of the 
day. The Dow closed down 28.79 at 9,064.45, the Nasdaq is down 8.55 at 1,957.41 and the S&P 500 is down 2.55 
at 976.71.
Sector News
Airline stocks are turning in some of the day's weakest performances, as reflected by the 1.2 percent pullback by 
the NYSE Arca Airline Index. The day's retreat has dragged the index off of its best closing level in well over five 
months.
The index is being pulled down by shares of Ryanair (RYAAY), which are down by 6 percent. The move comes 
after the firm reported second quarter revenues that fell compared to last year while issuing a cautious outlook for 
the second half of the year.
Notable weakness is also visible among health insurance and railroad stocks, with the Morgan Stanley Healthcare 
Payor Index 1.8 and the Dow Jones Railroads Index down 1 percent. The healthcare index is moving off of its best 
closing level in nearly a month, while the railroads index is pulling back off its highest closing level in nearly eight 
months.
Stocks Remain Mostly Negative In Early Afternoon Trading - U.S. Commentary
While networking, software, and wireless stocks also continue to drag down the tech-heavy Nasdaq, strength 
remains visible among banking, brokerage and housing stocks.
The Kbw Bank Index and the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index are up by 2.7 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. 
The brokerage index has risen to its best level in over eight months, while the banking index remains in a recent 
range.
Further, the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index is up by 1.8 percent, extending its gains for a fourth straight session 
to reach its best intraday level in over two months. Housing stocks were helped higher following the promising 
results of the day's new home sales report.
Stocks In The News
Shares of RadioShack are moving lower in early afternoon trading after the firm's second quarter revenues fell by 
2.9 percent, coming in at $965.7 million compared to analyst estimates of $977.86 million. The stock has plunged 
by 6.9 percent, backing off of its best closing level in over nine months.
Corning is also under pressure despite reporting second quarter earnings and revenues that were better than 
analysts expected. The stock is down by 3.8 percent, falling away from its best price level in roughly ten months set 
on Friday.
On the other hand, shares of Varian (VARI) are soaring after reaching an agreement to be acquired by Agilent (A) 
for about $1.5 billion in cash. The stock is currently up by 29 percent, reaching its best intraday level in eleven 
months.
In Focus: New Home Sales, Earnings News
As mentioned above, data from the Commerce Department showed that new home sales rose to an annual rate of 
384,000 in June from the revised May rate of 346,000. Economists had expected sales to rise to 352,000 from the 
342,000 originally reported for the previous month.
The stronger than expected sales growth came amid a pullback in prices, with the median sales price of new 
houses sold in June falling 5.8 percent to $206,200 from $219,000 in the previous month. The median sales price 
had increased for two consecutive months.
In earnings news, Tellabs reported adjusted second quarter net earnings of $0.08 per share, compared to $0.04 per 
share in the same quarter last year. Total revenue declined to $385.4 million from $432.5 million in the same period 
a year ago. Wall Street analysts expected the company to report earnings of $0.06 per share on revenues of 
$381.34 million.
Verizon Communications announced adjusted second quarter net income of $0.63 per share, compared with $0.67 
per share a year earlier. Analysts anticipated the company to report earnings of $0.63 per share.
Honeywell revealed second-quarter net income of $0.60 per share, compared to $0.96 per share in the same 
quarter of last year. The results came in line with analyst forecasts of $0.60 per share for the quarter.
Aetna reported adjusted second quarter net income of $0.68 per share, compared to $0.94 per share in the year-
ago quarter. The results failed to meet Wall Street expectations, which called for quarterly earnings at $0.78 per 
share.
Other Markets
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region finished on the upside on Monday. While Japan's 
benchmark Nikkei 225 Index posted a 1.5 percent gain, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose by 1.4 percent.

The major European markets also ended the day higher after seeing some volatility. The German DAX Index rose 
by 0.4 percent, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both eked out gains of 0.2 percent.
In the bond markets, treasuries remain stuck in negative territory. Subsequently the yield on the benchmark ten-
year note is trading at 3.713 percent, posting gain of 4.3 basis points on the day.

Ryanair 's net profit surges on lower fuel costs

Irish no-frills airline Ryanair Holdings PLC reported surging first-quarter profit on Monday, citing sharply lower fuel 
costs and a business model that thrives during recession.
The carrier said net profit for the three-month period ending June 30 was €136.5 million ($194.5 million) compared 
to €21 million in the same quarter of 2008.
Sales were virtually flat at €774.7 million ($1.1 billion) versus €776.9 million a year earlier. But fuel costs fell 41.6 
percent to €214.1 million. The better results also reflected much lower write-off costs for depreciating assets, chiefly 
its aircraft fleet and Ryanair's 30 percent shareholding in its loss-making Irish rival, Aer Lingus.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair expects to record full-year net profit in a range of €200 million to 
€300 million as it keeps expanding routes and bases.
"Ryanair will be the only major European airline to deliver passenger and profit growth in the current year. ... We will 
continue to expand as others fail," O'Leary said in a statement.

  Santander is expected to report relatively healthy second-quarter profits, writes Mark Mulligan . Wider lending 
margins and an improved outlook in some of the weaker economies that it is exposed to have offset currency 
factors and provisions against rising bad loans.
Analysts expect net profits for the three months to the end of June at between EUR1.7bn and EUR2bn - on 
revenues ahead more than 15 per cent to between EUR8.7bn and EUR9bn. The bank itself said in a regulatory 
filing three weeks ago that the second-quarter results "had developed as expected", and that it remained on course

to match 2008's annual profit of EUR8.8bn for the full year. The bank, the eurozone's largest by market 
capitalisation, said there would be "no relevant extraordinary factors" in the second quarter. Analysts and investors 
will be looking for further signs of a deceleration in the growth of non-performing loans, which were at 2.5 per cent 
of total lending at the end of March.

  For BAE Systems, 2008 was a blow-out year in which pre-tax profits almost doubled, writes Jeremy Lemer . 
However, investors suspect budget pressures in the US and Europe will make 2009 and beyond tougher.
In the past six months BAE's share price has dropped almost 18 per cent to 332p. Sales of armoured vehicles in 
America are set to slow as the US withdraws from Iraq and an exchange-rate tailwind has slackened. But there are 
reasons to be hopeful.
As production of the F-35 fighter jet increases, BAE will benefit from its 18 per cent work share and the company 
will likely be able to sell more combat aircraft, land systems and services to Saudi Arabia.
Analysts expect the company to post pre-tax profits of about £910m on sales of about £9.4bn in the first half, 
respectively 20 per cent and 7 per cent higher than 2008.
  Hard evidence about the extent of any recovery in Japan's electronics sector will be revealed as as many of its big 
players report first-quarter results, writes Robin Harding .
Sony, Nintendo, Sharp , NEC, Fujitsu and Sanyo Electric all report today and analysts expect the figures to be 
much improved on the disastrous last quarter.
Corporate Diary
After the large rally in share prices in the past three months, investors want to know whether companies are 
experiencing a real recovery in demand, or whether customers are simply rebuilding depleted inventories. Sony and 
Nintendo's results will come under the closest scrutiny because of the slowdown in video game sales. US sales 
were down by 31 per cent on the previous year in June according to NPD.
Barclays Capital forecasts that Nintendo will sell 22.5m Wii consoles this year, versus the company's own forecast 
of 26m, but says lower Wii sales are already reflected in the share price.
  Japan's three mega-banks are expected to report somewhat better results in the first quarter, following a dismal 
year that saw all three post large losses, writes Michiyo Nakamoto .
Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui , which all report first-quarter results this week, are forecasting a 
return to profitability in the full year. One factor behind this potential recovery is the stock market rebound, with the 
Nikkei average up 16 per cent since the beginning of April.
Japanese banks still retain huge shareholdings to cement ties with corporate customers, which were a cause of 
their poor performance last year when the stock market slumped. Lending has also improved somewhat thanks to a 
stabilising economic environment.

 De Beers reported its interims last Friday and Anglo Platinum reported on Monday, writes William MacNamara . 
As a result, Anglo American's two most underperforming, debt-saddled divisions - diamonds and platinum - will 
have disclosed their pain and promises to the market ahead of Anglo's group interims. Offsetting these are a 
relatively solid set of results from Kumba Iron Ore, another division that reported last week. Expect coal to be the 
standout performance disclosed by Anglo. Generally weak results will reflect the trauma of the period.
More focus will be on management's defence of the company and its plans to create value as Xstrata lurks with a 
merger offer that management has rejected.
Before Anglo Platinum and De Beers reported, consensus forecasts saw pre-tax profits falling to $1.7bn from 
$5.6bn, revenues sliding to $11.1bn from $17.9bn and earnings per share dropping to $0.68 from $2.90.

Ryanair, the low-cost carrier, today announced a huge leap in profits thanks to falling oil costs and rising passenger 
numbers, but shares fell after it warned on full-year numbers.
In a stark turnaround from June's full-year update, the group said adjusted profits had risen from 21 million in the 
first quarter last year to 136.5 million in the first three months of the new financial year, although the figure was 
distorted by lower fuel costs.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary said fuel costs had dropped by 42% to 214 million, with the company getting a lift 
from its decision not to hedge its fuel costs last year when prices were higher.
He added that passenger numbers had risen 11% from 15 million to 16.6 million as a result of lower prices, leaving 
the group on track to hit full-year passenger targets.
The turnaround in profits comes after last month's full-year numbers, which showed that pre-tax profits for the 12 
months to the end of March had slid by 78%, with the group affected by a writedown on its investment in Aer 
Lingus.
But shares in the business fell today, after O'Leary warned that yields were weakening and tourism was expected to 
be muted.
O'Leary said: 'Our outlook remains cautious for the remainder of the fiscal year. Traffic growth is strong, but at 
much weaker yields due to the recession and the impact of tourist tax in Ireland and the UK.
'We have limited visibility beyond the next two months, but expect passengers to be very price-sensitive for the rest 
of the year.'
As a result he said full-year net profit would likely be towards the lower end of the 200 to 300 million range 
previously indicated.
The comments sent shares sharply lower, and by 08:32 they were off 9.5% or 0.32 cents, at 3.055.

Share prices make a confident start to the week as investors pin their hopes on a gradual economic recovery, with 
sentiment boosted by better-than-expected interim results from Pearson, 41p higher at 646p.
By 8.30am, the FTSE 100 index was up 20 points at 4,596 and the Mid-250 index was 48 points higher at 7,987.
Lloyds rose 2.20p to 80.35p ahead of figures soon, helped by a Nomura rating upgrade, while buoyant mining 
issues featured Lonmin at £13, up 57p as Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to neutral from sell.
Antofagasta at 77.50p, up 27.50p, and Kazakhmys at 839p, up 28.50p, were other major gainers in the sector.
Favourable weekend comment and the upbeat statement from Pearson sustained demand for Reed Elsevier, 8.25p 
better at 489.50p, and Wolseley advanced 14p to £12.15, despite revealing a 60% drop in 11 months' profits.
In contrast, Rexam plunged 33.25p to 290.25p after confirming weekend reports of possible equity-raising, and 
Friends Provident dipped 0.38p to 70.40p after terminating merger talks with Resolution.
Stores lost ground under the lead of Marks & Spencer, 4.50p easier at 334.50p, and an RBS rating downgrade 
contributed to a fall of 13p to £13.28 in SABMiller.
British Airways slipped 2.10p to 134.80p after suspending its Open Skies service between Amsterdam and New 
York, with easyJet 10.25p easier at 273.75p in the wake of rival Ryanair's warning of a difficult year ahead.
On the takeover front, National Express climbed another 16.25p to 362p as Stagecoach confirmed talks with the 
Cosen consortium over buying parts of the UK transport group.
Liberty gained 25p to 285p as it considers expansion possibilities.

Share prices slipped back from renewed early strength, as investors realised profits built up over the past 10 trading 
sessions. But the underlying tone holds firm.
By 10.30am, the FTSE 100 index was up four points at 4,580, but the Mid-250p index was 62 points easier at 
7,876.
Stores were hardest hit, with Home Retail at 297p, Marks & Spencer at 330p and Next at £16.56, down 8.50p to 
41p.
The cautious outlook from Ryanair contributed to a 4.60p fall in British Airways, at 132.30p, while properties and 
utilities remained on offer.
Pearson was the session's best gainer at 666p, up 60p, as interim profits exceeded expectations and bank shares 
held firm ahead of the reporting season.
BP jumped 7.40p to 518.25p in front of tomorrow's update in firm oils.
A Deutsche Bank buy rating underpinned Investec at 415p, up 5p, and Friends United sale hopes sustained ITV at 
38.75p, up a penny.
A solid trading statement failed to support Pace at 194.50p, down 5.75p.

People's bank
The start of the week signalled the next stage in Sir Terry Leahy's mission to make Tesco a "people's bank". The 
group suggested its retail services business could apply for a separate rating from credit agencies and borrow 
directly in the market. Andrew Higginson, retailing services chief, said dabbling in debt markets would be necessary 
"if you're going to build a sizeable [mortgage] book". The group last year bought from RBS the other half of Tesco 
Personal Finance, which has six million accounts and has doubled deposits to £4.5bn since October. Mr Higginson 
declined to say whether Tesco had Northern Rock in its sights. But his hint that big deals were "not the Tesco way" 
suggested a redistribution of accounts from Newcastle in the near future might be stretching Leahy's populist 
metaphor.
Unfriendly
Friends Provident upped the ante in talks with Clive Cowdery's Resolution, rejecting the group's structure and 
governance as "totally inappropriate in a public company context and materially out of line with currently accepted 
best governance practice". Friends has rejected Resolution's proposal that it issue 0.8 new shares for each Friends 
share and countered with a proposal that Friends acquire Resolution to bring Mr Cowdery on board. But while 
Resolution has tried to clear the air with a cash component for the first 2,500 shares held by any investor up to an 
unspecified limit on the total cash it would pay, Mr Cowdery has ruled out making any offer that would compromise 
Resolution's model as a separate financial services buy-out vehicle.
Coming down
Ryanair said it would cut the number of aircraft operating from Stansted 40 per cent this winter and blamed BAA 
and the UK government. Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said a combination of BAA's rejection of Ryanair 
demands for cuts in charges and the plan to raise duty from £10 to £11 per departing passenger in November had 
driven the cuts. BAA forecast a 6 to 7 per cent fall in Ryanair passengers this winter but Stansted said Ryanair's 
reduction in aircraft operating from the airport from 40 this summer to 24 in winter had more to do with the seasons. 
The airport said the previous winter had seen Ryanair reduce its fleet from 36 to 28.
Italian retreat
The big stories
Sportingbet conceded defeat in Italy, putting a "for sale" sign on its local operations after three years of failing to 
turn a profit there. The group, which paid EUR2.9m (£2.5m) to enter via a 50 per cent stake in Puntobet in 2006, 
blamed Rome's failure to liberalise the market in the way it expected. Sportingbet took ownership of Puntobet in 
2007 expecting an increase in the maximum betting pay-out allowed from EUR10,000 and relaxation of curbs on 
use of software to the advantage of its model. But in the end Italy authorised 13,500 new gaming shops rather than 
further deregulate the online market.

Body
Is Michael O'Leary a child of the Soviet Union, something of a fellow traveller? OK, it might not be the first thing one 
associates with Ryanair's Irish boss, the very personification of raw business drive who turned a struggling low-cost 
airline into a successful profit machine - all the while railing at bloated competitors and deploying a mischievous turn 
of phrase to generate more coverage than any marketing budget could ever deliver.
The reason I ask is that as thoughts now turn to tales of delays and lost baggage, I am transported back to the late 
1970s when as a young westerner living in the Soviet Union I was presented with a vision of the future. It came in 
the form of a prim lecture from an official on the superiority of aviation under communism.
Not only was it far more extensive and cheaper than in the west, it was less elitist. While back home air travel was 
for the few, in the USSR it was for the many - just another mode of public transport. Aeroflot, the national carrier, 
was both the world's biggest airline and one of the cheapest, so catching the red-eye to Vladivostok was as easy as 
hopping on the Number 2 trolley bus on Kutuzovsky Prospekt.
Frankly, it was difficult to know where to start. Maybe with the pervasive, sweet, plasticy smell of the planes or the 
routine delays and constant lack of information. Or how about the flint-faced stewardesses stomping down the aisle 
offering the "choice" of tangy water or tangy water? Or perhaps the unspeakable food, the shabby fittings and the 
bleak, run-down airports in the middle of nowhere. Then who can forget the grumpy staff for whom dialogue was an 
alien concept, preferring instead to find new ways of deploying arbitrary rules and associated punishments. All in all, 
not unlike a rush-hour ride on the Number 2 trolley bus.
Any of this sound familiar? We may have scoffed at the notion of Aeroflot leading the world. But how wrong we 
were. Thirty years on it is clear that far from being a laughable expression of a clapped-out system destined to 
crash under the weight of its internal contradictions, Aeroflot was in fact the pioneer. Low-cost travel today is simply 
playing catch-up with those Heroes of the Soviet Union: passengers packed in like sardines, robbed of respect and 
Pioneers of the Ryanair revolution
subjected to a baffling array of terms, conditions and penalties. Passengers do not interact with people but with an 
impersonal, unforgiving apparat dedicated to the ruthless pursuit of a (centrally fixed) plan.
The spirit of Aeroflot not only lives on but - in the spirit of letting a thousand flowers bloom - has spawned countless, 
successful western disciples. Twenty years after the collapse of communism and with capitalism now going through 
its own spot of turbulence, revisionism is in the air. Fasten your seatbelts.

Lloyd's of London, one of the world's biggest insurance and reinsurance marketplaces in the world, today opened

Its chairman Lord Peter Levene said at the opening ceremony that the group - a fixture of the global industry for

"Dublin has become a significant financial centre, and even with all the problems . it's a good market, it's an 
important market. So we need to be here."
Its premium income from Ireland was about E170 million last year, although this is well down on previous years. 
Lloyd's Irish client base includes several household names such as CIE and Ryanair. The purpose of the opening a 
Dublin office is to make its presence more obvious and to promote the business here.

CRH and banking stocks helped lift the ISEQ index well out of the red as investors at home and abroad applauded 
earnings news.
The ISEQ rose by 96.66 points to 2,827.87.
Another day of strong gains on Wall Street and across Europe also boosted Irish investor confidence after hopeful 
signs on the US economy.
CRH's shares continue to benefit from the hope that President Obama's stimulus package will lift the Irish firm's key 
US market. According to the latest update from the US over 60pc of the USD26.8bn allocated to highways under 
the stimulus plan has now been obligated to projects. In absolute terms, this represents USD17.bn, up from 
USD16.2m at the end of June. This is also seen in the obligated highway funds data (also out yesterday), which 
more than doubled in June to USD6.45bn versus a broadly flat outcome if stimulus funds are excluded. However, 
the most important figure is the level of payments made to contractors from stimulus funds, which now stands at 
USD400m, representing a significant pick-up from USD264m at the end of June and USD150bn by June 15, 
according to Goodbody Stockbrokers. CRH's stocks rose by 39c to E17.40. Banks put in a better performance than 
of late with AIB gaining 11c to E1.74, Bank of Ireland was 14c to the better at E1.74 and Irish Life and Permanent 
climbed 24c to E3.29. Crisis-hit banks in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU may have to divest assets and hold back 
on acquisitions to gain EU regulatory approval for their state bailouts, the EU Commission said. The European 
Union executive has to date cleared 70 banking rescues across the region, with a number of lenders due shortly to 
present restructuring plans for review. The new restructuring rules, broadly in line with a draft document obtained by 
Reuters last week, will be in force until the end of December 2010. The guidelines include structural measures that 
may see some banks selling assets over a number of years, and behavioural remedies such as constraints on 
acquisitions or on aggressive pricing and marketing strategies funded by state aid, it said. Shares in Ryanair gained 
ISEQ surges amid hopeful signs from US ISEQ Up
by 14c to E3.43 ahead of its latest results due on Monday. While highlighting a profitable summer, Davy would 
expect it to reiterate the guidance from the beginning of June of net income of E200 to 300m compared to the 
broker's estimate of around E300m) for full year 2010. Davy numbers for the quarter are for net income of E108.4m 
(EPS 7.3c) based on unit revenue declines of 10.9pc (including yield declines of 15pc), 7pc ancillary revenue per 
passenger growth, fuel price per passenger down 44pc and ex-fuel costs down 4.8pc. Closely watched will be the 
level of yield attrition this summer. Shares in construction sector service provider, Siteserv, were unmoved at E0.08 
after it posted a 24pc drop in pre-tax profit before exceptionals to E9.3m for the year to April. The quoted group 
provides a range of services from scaffolding hire and fencing to utilities maintenance. Turnover nearly doubled to 
E228.6m because of takeovers. However, the group dropped into a loss before tax of E37.93m after exceptional 
writedowns of E38.46m. Chief executive Brian Harvey said the group had made significant progress in the year, the 
"very difficult economic climate and intense competitive pressures".

Michael O'Leary is not someone to let an inconvenient truth obstruct a higher public relations mission. The 
"unacceptable face of capitalism", as Mr O'Leary's Irish critics have dubbed Ryanair's chief executive, has launched 
a salvo against airport fees in the UK generally and BAA in particular, which owns Stansted, Ryanair's UK base. 
Because they are high, Mr O'Leary is slashing winter flights and moving jets elsewhere.
This is disingenuous. Ryanair, like all airlines, is cutting winter capacity. Furthermore, Stansted has never charged 
airlines as much as its regulators allow. Last year, the fee cap was set at £6.44. Stansted charged £5.50. This gap 
is a consequence of the bargaining power of its main users, Ryanair and EasyJet, and the competition it faces from 
other European airports.
Unlike long-haul carriers, which need to maintain feeder routes into their hubs, low-cost carriers run a series of 
point-to-point businesses. Aircraft are therefore mobile assets that can be parked wherever and whenever it is 
cheapest or most profitable to do so. Ryanair is only responding to market forces. When summer demand returns, 
so will the aircraft. As for UK passenger taxes, these are set to rise by 10 per cent to £11 per passenger in 
November, which Mr O'Leary says damages "London and UK tourism and the British economy generally". It is true 
that UK duties are a European anomaly. Yet the marginal effect of that increase on a holiday's total cost is 
minuscule.
The 9 per cent depreciation of sterling against the euro over the past 12 months has had a far greater impact - and 
may even encourage more holidaymakers to visit Britain on Ryanair than it has stopped others travelling to Europe. 
Mr O'Leary wants to have his cake and be applauded for eating it too.

Michael O'Leary's ability to spin a tale has reached a new level this week. Along with the gullibility of parts of the 
media in accepting it. Hook, line and sinker.
"Ryanair cuts Stansted winter capacity by 40 per cent," claimed his press release. The assertion was patently 
rubbish. But it is almost universally already accepted as fact. On the most charitable assessment, he is planning to 
cut Stansted winter capacity by 14 per cent. The probability is that the year-on-year decline in Ryanair passenger 
numbers at Stansted will be much lower even than that. BAA, Stansted's owner, is forecasting a drop of 6 to 7 per 
cent.
To get to the claim of a drop of 40 per cent Mr O'Leary is comparing an apple with a pear. He is comparing the 
number of aircraft he is operating from Stansted, his biggest base, this summer (40) with the number he plans to 
deploy in the winter (24). But the airline industry is highly seasonal. Comparing Ryanair's summer capacity with its 
winter capacity at any airport is about as useful as saying "ice-cream sales to fall by 40 per cent this winter" or 
"temperature to fall by 40 per cent". Shock horror.
Last winter Ryanair operated between 26 and 28 aircraft at Stansted. This year it is planning to operate 24, a 
decline of at most 14 per cent year-on-year and a long way from the claimed fall of 40 per cent. The decline will 
doubtless be even less in the number of flights operated year-on-year. Mr O'Leary chose to describe only the 
number of aircraft overnighting at Stansted. He gave no numbers for the volume of weekly flights that includes 
services operating in and out of Stansted from other Ryanair bases.
The summer/winter capacity comparison is about as silly as comparing profits/losses between different quarters of 
the year rather than year-on-year. Not even Ryanair has yet adopted that approach as a new accounting standard.
This week's spin was egregious even by Mr O'Leary's standards. A year ago, when he staged the same show over 
cutbacks at Stansted, at least he had the good grace to compare an apple with an apple. But the result was much 
less impressive.

It's an ill wind - or an unfortunate sneeze - that blows nobody any good. The prospect of a boost to sales from swine 
flu vaccines and antivirals added a frisson of excitement to otherwise solid second-quarter results yesterday from 
GlaxoSmithKline.
More than 700 people worldwide, including 31 in the UK, have died from the H1N1 virus, which the World Health 
Organisation says is spreading faster than any previous flu pandemic. Analysts expect it to boost not only GSK but 
also Roche, which reports today, and Sanofi-Aventis, due next week, on top of recent strong results from Novartis 
of Switzerland and Baxter of the US.
Andrew Witty, chief executive, says GSK already has orders for 195m doses of the vaccine it is developing and 
expects more as talks continue with 50 governments. There are uncertainties, though, over how quickly companies 
can meet demand.
The vaccine, with shipments due to begin around September, is made by cultivating the virus into an antigen. As 
Novartis and Baxter warned last week, samples are yielding lower than usual amounts of antigen, raising fears of 
shortfalls. GSK is optimistic, though, about meeting demand. It is also tripling production capacity for Relenza, its 
antiviral treatment.
GSK's pre-tax profit for the three months to June was up 12 per cent to £2bn on sales that grew 14 per cent to 
£6.7bn compared with a year ago. But in constant exchange rate terms, sales fell 2 per cent and operating profit 6 
per cent. That was in line with forecasts and the shares dipped 0.6 per cent to £11.54, despite GSK raising its 
dividend from 13p to 14p.
Mr Whitty, appointed last year, is making steady progress with his "grow, deliver and simplify" approach. In the US, 
which accounts for one-third of turnover and where it has faced intense competition from generic drugs 
manufacturers, GSK predicts a boost from new drugs after a 15 per cent drop in sales in the quarter.
Diversification is proceeding, with a 14 per cent rise in emerging market turnover, similar growth in vaccine sales 
and a 9 per cent increase in consumer healthcare. Cost reduction is on track.
The company that's sneezing all the way to the bank
Mr Whitty accepts these are "only the first steps" GSK must take to create a better balanced business that delivers 
sustainable growth. The consensus forecast is for £8.9bn pre-tax profit for the full year, giving a prospective 
price/earnings multiple of 10.4 - about right, in spite of the fuss over flu.

The Dublin shares market inched out of the red this morning as banking stocks rebounded after three days of 
losses.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 8.88 points to 2,757.60.
Shares in AIB rose by 8c to E1.71, Bank of Ireland climbed 4c to E1.62 and Irish Life and Permanent rose by 6c to 
E2.96.
Bank of Ireland said it has successfully tapped in to its September 2010 Government Guaranteed fixed rate bond to 
the tune of E500m. The original public benchmark transaction was issued in November last year and raised E2 
billion. The first public tap of the issue was done on 30th April 2009, raising E1 billion. Today's tap was 
oversubscribed with a final order book of over E800 million within 20 minutes. There was a strong international 
participation in the tap with 93pc of orders from outside of Ireland. A total of 22 investors from 11 countries 
participated in the transaction. ILP shares rose despite global ratings agency, Fitch, downgrading its ratings to "C" 
from "B/C" and removed it from rating watch negative. Matthew Taylor, senior director in Fitch's financial institutions 
team, said while ILP's loan book contained fewer risks than those of its peers the "operating environment has 
significantly deteriorated which Fitch expects to lead to falling revenues and larger loan impairment charges, 
causing profitability to shrink". Shares in CRH fell by 6c to E16.98, keeping a lid on the ISEQ's gains. The US 
Architectural Billings Index (ABI), a lead indicator of future non-residential construction activity, fell to 37.7 in June 
from 42.9 in May. The ABI reading shows an approximate 9-12 month lag between billings and construction 
spending. A reading below 50 indicates a decrease in billings. According to the UK's Revenue and Customs, 
seasonally adjusted UK housing transactions (with a value of £40,000 and over) were 65,000 in June. This was up 
from 63,000 in May and the highest level of housing transactions since October 2008. The low was 
January/February (53,000). Shares in Grafton gained 11c to E2.89, Kingspan climbed 5c to E4.42 and McInerney

The Dublin shares market inched out of the red this morning as banking stocks rebounded after three days of 
losses.
By 12:30, the ISEQ had gained 8.88 points to 2,757.60.
Shares in AIB rose by 8c to E1.71, Bank of Ireland climbed 4c to E1.62 and Irish Life and Permanent rose by 6c to 
E2.96.
Bank of Ireland said it has successfully tapped in to its September 2010 Government Guaranteed fixed rate bond to 
the tune of E500m. The original public benchmark transaction was issued in November last year and raised E2 
billion. The first public tap of the issue was done on 30th April 2009, raising E1 billion. Today's tap was 
oversubscribed with a final order book of over E800 million within 20 minutes. There was a strong international 
participation in the tap with 93pc of orders from outside of Ireland. A total of 22 investors from 11 countries 
participated in the transaction. ILP shares rose despite global ratings agency, Fitch, downgrading its ratings to "C" 
from "B/C" and removed it from rating watch negative. Matthew Taylor, senior director in Fitch's financial institutions 
team, said while ILP's loan book contained fewer risks than those of its peers the "operating environment has 
significantly deteriorated which Fitch expects to lead to falling revenues and larger loan impairment charges, 
causing profitability to shrink". Shares in CRH fell by 6c to E16.98, keeping a lid on the ISEQ's gains. The US 
Architectural Billings Index (ABI), a lead indicator of future non-residential construction activity, fell to 37.7 in June 
from 42.9 in May. The ABI reading shows an approximate 9-12 month lag between billings and construction 
spending. A reading below 50 indicates a decrease in billings. According to the UK's Revenue and Customs, 
seasonally adjusted UK housing transactions (with a value of £40,000 and over) were 65,000 in June. This was up 
from 63,000 in May and the highest level of housing transactions since October 2008. The low was

Move to low-charge European airports
Body
Ryanair is planning to reduce capacity at London Stansted and Dublin, its two biggest European bases, next winter 
as it cuts lossmaking routes and moves aircraft to airports in continental Europe to take advantage of lower 
charges.
Europe's leading short-haul carrier has been engaged in a long-running dispute with both Stansted, owned by BAA, 
a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial, and state-owned Dublin airport, over the level of airport charges. It has also been 
fighting planned increases in air passenger taxes in the UK and Ireland.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, said yesterday the group was planning to cut Stansted winter capacity by 
40 per cent, but the claim was based on comparing summer and winter capacity levels, essentially an "apples and 
pears" comparison.
He said the airline was reducing the number of aircraft operated at Stansted from 40 this summer (April to October) 
to 24 in the coming winter season (November to March), a reduction of 40 per cent.
On a like-for-like basis, however, the normal basis for comparison, the number of aircraft to be operated at Stansted 
will be reduced by only 14 per cent, from 28 last winter to 24 in the coming winter.
The airport expects Ryan-air passenger numbers to fall by less than 7 per cent year-on-year next winter.
Ryanair said it was cutting Stansted winter capacity because BAA had rejected its demand for deep cuts in airport 
charges and in protest at the UK government's plan to raise air passenger duty from £10 to £11 per departing 
passenger in November.
Stewart Wingate, managing director of Stansted, said the Ryanair announcement meant it was "business as usual" 
at the -airport.
Ryanair looks at reducing capacity at Stansted and Dublin
"Last winter, Ryanair reduced its aircraft fleet here to 28 [from 36 the previous winter]. This year it will be 24.
"It is common practice for them to reduce frequency to various destinations during the winter season, as they have 
done in previous years."
In July last year the Irish carrier warned that its passenger traffic at Stansted would drop by 900,000 passengers in 
the winter of 2008-09, but BAA said yesterday the outcome had been a fall of about 400,000.
The airline industry is highly seasonal and most airlines in the northern hemisphere, including Ryan-air, routinely 
operate significantly fewer aircraft in the winter than in the summer, using the winter months to conduct essential 
maintenance work when demand is lower.

Highlight: Stansted and Dublin winter flights pared
Battle with BAA and departure tax rejoined
Body
Ryanair, Europe's biggest low-cost carrier, plans to cut services at London Stansted and Dublin, its two largest 
bases, this winter as it pares loss-making routes and moves aircraft to airports in continental Europe to benefit from 
lower charges.
Michael O'Leary, the group's chief executive, used the capacity cuts as a weapon in his long-running battle with 
Stansted, which is owned by BAA, a subsidiary of Spain's Ferrovial, and with state-owned Dublin airport, over 
airport fees.
He also blamed the cuts on planned increases in air passenger taxes in the UK and Ireland. Mr O'Leary said: 
"Sadly, UK traffic and tourism continue to collapse while Ryanair continues to grow traffic rapidly in those countries 
that welcome tourists instead of taxing them."
He said the group was planning to cut Stansted winter capacity by 40 per cent. That claim was based on comparing 
summer and winter capacity levels. Ryanair would reduce the number of aircraft operated at Stansted from 40 this 
summer (April to October) to 24 in winter (November to March).
On a like-for-like basis, the number of aircraft to be operated at Stansted will be reduced by 14 per cent to 24 in the 
winter, from 28 planes a year ago. BAA has forecast a fall of 6-7 per cent in Ryanair passengers at Stansted this 
winter.
Ryanair said it was cutting Stansted winter capacity because BAA had rejected its demand for deep cuts in airport 
charges and in protest at the UK government's plan to raise air passenger duty from £10 to £11 per departing 
passenger in November.
"Gordon Brown's £10 tourist tax and the BAA monopoly's high airport charges are damaging London and UK 
tourism and the British economy generally," Mr O'Leary said.

"Last winter Ryanair reduced its aircraft fleet here to 28 (from 36 the previous winter), this year it will be 24. It is

In July last year, the Irish carrier warned its passenger traffic at Stansted would drop by 900,000 passengers in the 
winter of 2008-09, but BAA said the fall had been about 400,000.
The airline industry is highly seasonal and most airlines in the northern hemisphere, including Ryanair, routinely 
operate significantly fewer aircraft in the winter than in the summer, using the winter months to conduct essential 
maintenance work, when demand is lower.
BAA said Ryanair passenger numbers at Stansted fell by 2 per cent in the 12 months to the end of March from 15m 
a year earlier to 14.7m. It forecast a fall in Ryanair passengers next winter.

Hard-hit European airlines said Wednesday that airport fee hikes are hurting their ability to weather the economic 
crisis as passenger numbers plunge.
The Association of European Airlines said airports "could do with a reality check" when they increase the fees each 
passenger must pay on top of their air fares. This is holding back airlines' ability to boost travel with lower prices, it 
said.
The group which represents major carriers such as British Airways and Lufthansa said German airports are leading 
the charge with higher fees at Frankfurt and Munich and others are reconsidering fee freezes.
"Customers are struggling to survive in the current market and the very last thing they need is a cost increase," said 
the AEA's Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus.
Europe's busiest airport London Heathrow is also planning to increase fees to pay for new infrastructure and to 
cope with the recession-driven drop in air traffic. Copenhagen will reinstate fee increases by the end of 2009.

Ryanair Holdings PLC said Tuesday it will heavily reduce flights from its main London hub for the second winter in a 
row, citing high costs and seasonally lower demand.
The airline said it will base 24 aircraft at Stansted Airport from October through March, down from the current 40. 
The October-March period is low season for European airlines, and business has been particularly poor since 
economic recession began rolling across the continent over the past year.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary pinned the blame for Ryanair's temporary reductions principally on a 10 pound 
(€11.50, $14) British tax levied on each passenger as well as fees charged by the Stansted operator, BAA.
The Dublin-based airline previously had warned that it would cut services unless Britain and BAA slashed those 
costs over the slower winter-time period. Instead, the British government tax will rise to 11 pounds per head in 
November.
O'Leary called the British taxes on passengers "insane" and suggested that Ryanair would shift business to 
countries including Spain, Greece, Belgium and the Netherlands where authorities are trimming airport taxes and 
fees.
"Sadly UK traffic and tourism continues to collapse while Ryanair continues to grow traffic rapidly in those countries 
which welcome tourists instead of taxing them," O'Leary said in a statement.
Ryanair made a similar move last year, when it cut the winter-time fleet at Stansted from 40 to 28. It levied the 
same complaints against British authorities then, too. The airline has taken a similar approach at its second-biggest 
base, Dublin Airport, trimming winter services and blaming the Irish government and airport operator.
Typically, Ryanair reallocates at least some Stansted-based aircraft each winter to other bases for routes to 
Mediterranean sun spots and ski resorts in the Alps.

Ryanair is to reduce its capacity from Stansted Airport by 40pc starting in October to cut costs.
The no-frills Irish airline operated 40 aircraft from Stansted this summer but will reduce this to 24 aircraft this winter 
with a 30pc reduction in the number of weekly flights and a loss of 2.5m passengers at Stansted between October 
and March 2010.
It said it was making the cut because Stansted is one of Ryanair's two most expensive bases (Dublin is the other) 
and the airport operator, BAA, has rejected Ryanair's calls for deep cuts in passenger fees this winter.
It added that the UK's £10 travel tax, which will rise to £11 in November despite the slump in tourism, was a 
contributing factor. Ryanair said it will now switch the 16 aircraft from Stansted to other European bases where 
governments are scrapping tourist taxes and/or reducing passenger fees to zero. Michael O'Leary said: "Sadly UK

Ryanair is skimming off a tidy profit
from credit and debit card payments for tickets.
A survey by the consumer magazine Which? has found that the charges it levies on cards soared by over 600pc in 
18 months.
The study of the airline's card charges in Britain found that booking fees have increased in the past year from 70p 
to a staggering £5 each way for using a debit card, while using a credit card has increased £3 from £2 to £5 per 
person each way. Lorna Cowan, editor or Which? Holiday, said: "We understand that there is a charge to airlines 
for taking payment for flights with debit or credit cards and that this cost will be passed on to consumers. "But how 
can some of these airlines justify charging over 600 per cent more than they did 18 months ago? "The amount 
charged by the airlines should be reflective of the costs incurred by them." She added: "This does not appear to be 
the case with current charges, and we are concerned that airlines may be using them as a way of boosting profits." 
Ryanair spokesman Daniel de Carvalho hit out at the report, adding there are a number of ways to avoid the 
charges. He told BBC Radio yesterday: "Passengers know they can avoid payment handling charges altogether 
with Visa Electron, which 20 million Ryanair passengers will do this year while booking."

The study of the airline's card charges in Britain found that booking fees have increased in the past year from 70p 
to a staggering £5 each way for using a debit card, while using a credit card has increased £3 from £2 to £5 per 
person each way. Lorna Cowan, editor or Which? Holiday, said: "We understand that there is a charge to airlines 
for taking payment for flights with debit or credit cards and that this cost will be passed on to consumers. "But how 
can some of these airlines justify charging over 600 per cent more than they did 18 months ago? "The amount 
charged by the airlines should be reflective of the costs incurred by them." She added: "This does not appear to be 
the case with current charges, and we are concerned that airlines may be using them as a way of boosting profits." 
Ryanair spokesman Daniel de Carvalho hit out at the report, adding there are a number of ways to avoid the 
charges. He told BBC Radio yesterday: "Passengers know they can avoid payment handling charges altogether 
with Visa Electron, which 20 million Ryanair passengers will do this year while booking."

Rabbit out of a hat, or rabbit soon to be caught in headlights? Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus's surprise choice as its 
new chief executive, needs little instruction on the extent of the challenge he will take up later this year.
The German has had a colourful career in the airline industry but it is unlikely that even his previous experience, 
which includes an unforgettable stint as chief executive of Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier that collapsed 
spectacularly in 2001, will prepare him for the fun and games that lie ahead.
As the eleventh person to call the shots at Aer Lingus in just 16 years, Mueller will be conscious that the odds do 
not favour a lengthy spell in the top job of the former State airline.
His appointment makes the decision to part company with predecessor Dermot Mannion all the more puzzling. 
Shareholders will look forward to discovering at an early stage what qualities Mueller has that Mannion lacked.
Like Mannion, however, Mueller has emerged from relative obscurity. He will need to work hard to convince 
sceptics that he is top ofthe-list rather than bottom-of the barrel material.
Those sceptics may well include Aer Lingus's main shareholders: Ryanair, the government and Aer Lingus 
employees. Mueller's appointment is also a defining moment for Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington.
Barrington, an aviation industry veteran, has confined his achievements so far to an emotional (if successful) 
rejection of Ryanair's second takeover bid and the parting of company with Mannion. With hindsight, neither move 
looked particularly inspired.
Like Michael O'Leary with his takeover attempts, Barrington may hope that it is a case of third time lucky.

Body
It is a weekday morning in the small seaside Italian village to which I have relocated the hub of my commercial 
activities (a complex enterprise involving packing a notebook, pen and some sunscreen, and boarding a Ryanair 
flight).
Over a cappuccino and a sugary, custardy confection which Italians call a bombolone -but we might call a  1 
cholesterol shot -I have just finished reading an article in the Los Angeles Times about a condition called orthorexia.
Reportedly the latest life-threatening food fad to grip America, it involves an obsession with healthy eating. (The 
irony here has not escaped me.)
Most orthorexics start innocently enough -according to the Colorado doctor who unearthed the phenomenon -with a 
desire to make changes to their lifestyle for health or spiritual reasons.
But, because of the level of willpower such changes involve, ''few accomplish the changes gracefully . . .Most resort 
to an iron self-discipline bolstered by a hefty dose of superiority over those who eat junk food. Over time, what to 
eat, how much, and the consequences of dietary indiscretion come to occupy a greater and greater proportion of 
the orthorexic's day."
Blessed with the iron will of a warm doughnut, I think I can safely say I'm not an orthorexic. But I suspect I suffer 
from a related phenomenon, something you might call 'authentorexia' -the hankering for a purer, superior kind of 
life, one in which children are always happy, healthy and well-behaved, and the vegetables come covered in soil 
and are packed into paper bags for you by a kindly old lady, rather than served up foil-wrapped on a supermarket 
shelf.
The kind of life, in short, that you'd imagine is in abundance along this sandy strip of Liguria. And that is -once, 
perhaps - how things were. However, even in the 12 months since I last visited this part of the world, much has 
changed.
Off Message
Just as the upturn was slower coming to Italy than to other parts of the world, so too has the downturn been 
fashionably late in arriving. But arrive it has. House prices are holding steady, but salaries have fallen, and families 
increasingly need two incomes to survive.
Savings have taken a beating here, as they have everywhere else, and the traditional handouts from elderly parents 
to their adult children are drying up.
The cost of living is also rising. In the little shops that we authentorexics crave every time we stand in our wet 
raincoats in the queue at Spar, you can no longer fill up your basket with slices of oven-warm herb tarts, downy 
peaches and fragrant strawberries, and expect to get change out of  10. Instead, you might find yourself blinking 
and double-checking the receipt.
The local supermarket, which still -b y contrast - offers a pleasant surprise at the till with your week's supply of 
groceries, has extended its opening hours and, for the first time, offers a range of ready-cooked meals. As 
convenience food goes, it's delicious and comparatively inexpensive, but it is still indisputably convenience food.
On the beach, umbrellas and sun loungers are no longer folded up in unison at one o'clock, as families take 
themselves off to sit down in a local restaurant over a four-course meal. Instead, many stay put, shovelling focaccia 
bread stuffed with cheese into their mouths as they stand around on towels.
Meals are no longer always accompanied by a polite glass of the local red; now it's just as likely to be a fizzy soft 
drink or even a bottle of beer, necked down on the beach with lunch -a trend that was still unthinkable even a year 
ago.
All of this has resulted in another inescapable phenomenon, one which offends my authentorexic sensibilities and 
one which there is really no delicate way to describe:
there are more fat people. Not merely curvy, not just healthily Mediterranean -there is nothing euphemistic about 
these bodies baking generously in the sun and spilling out of swimsuits in all the wrong places.
Of course, this is what they warned us would happen as the global downturn took hold, but it's sobering and not a 
little alarming to see it happen so quickly.
The US, as ever, is ahead of the curve -the trend is so well established there, they even have a whole new name 
for the condition. 'Recession obesity' is what happens when you lose your job and health insurance, cut your gym 
membership and start opting for cheap, calorie rich foods.
According to a new study, more than 26.1 per cent of Americans are now classified as obese, the highest 
proportion in history. In the last year, obesity rates rose in 23 American states and didn't fall in any.
More alarmingly, since we don't expect much else from the US, the most recent EU-wide figures, which were taken 
in 2007 -before the recession started to take its toll - showed that 30 per cent of children in Spain, Greece and Italy 
now rank as obese. So much for the Mediterranean diet.
The trouble is, of course, that the Mediterranean diet is now just as likely to involve huge hunks of focaccia or 
generous slices of pizza washed down with sugary soft drinks as it is olive oil, fruit and vegetables accompanied by 
a glass of low-additive local red wine. There is more to this phenomenon than a question of not being able to afford 
to eat well.
In Italy, as with everywhere else, the distractions of modern life, the pressure of work, the spread of urbanisation 
and the tumbling economy mean that eating is no longer the occasion it was.
The advice from nutritionists about following a traditional diet, whether it was French, Japanese, or Italian, involved 
not just what they ate, but how they ate.
Off Message
This involved forsaking snacks, not eating on the hoof and making a ceremony of every morsel that passed your 
lips.
This is the kind of thing we authentorexics invariably lap up: the message that if we could just relocate to 
somewhere hot, sunny and with an abundance of olive oil, we could stop the obesity epidemic, the march of 
urbanisation and the worldwide recession in their tracks.
Which is why it's so disconcerting to arrive on your holidays and discover that the obesity epidemic, the march of 
urbanisation and the worldwide recession have got their towels on the sun-loungers first.

Struggling Irish airline Aer Lingus Group PLC on Friday appointed Christoph Mueller as its new chief executive in 
hopes that the German's experience running low-cost airlines will give it an edge over archrival Ryanair.
Mueller, 47, for the past two years has been aviation director at Anglo-German travel group TUI Travel PLC, where 
he managed charter airlines with 160 aircraft and 11,000 employees. On Oct. 1 he will formally take charge at Aer 
Lingus, becoming its first non-Irish chief in its 73-year history.
He will face myriad challenges in Dublin, including tough calls on paring Aer Lingus' unionized work force, 
expanding or withdrawing from fledgling bases in Belfast and London, trying to revive business on its key U.S. 
routes and above all to stop the flow of business to Ryanair, its seemingly recession-proof rival.
Aer Lingus Chairman Colm Barrington who has warned of heavy losses in 2009 said Mueller "has the experience 
and the skillset to lead Aer Lingus through what is an unprecedented operating environment and to make the 
changes that are required."
Mueller previously held executive posts at Daimler Benz Aerospace, Lufthansa, Belgium's defunct Sabena airline, 
DHL and Deutsche Post.
In a statement Mueller said Aer Lingus "has an internationally renowned brand, and while there are many 
challenges ahead, I am excited about the medium-term prospects for the business."
He replaces Dermot Mannion, who quit three months ago amid criticism of Aer Lingus' aggressive spending on new 
planes and bases as Ireland's economy was unraveling. Ireland's steep recession has doubled unemployment over 
the past year and ravaged consumer confidence, spurring many of Aer Lingus' usual customers to stay at home or 
turn to often-cheaper Ryanair.
Ryanair, which doesn't recognize unions, has much lower labor costs and a much bigger European route network 
than Aer Lingus. The challenge of competing with Ryanair has already forced Aer Lingus to adopt most of Ryanair's 
Ireland 's Aer Lingus airline names Mueller new CEO
marketing and no-frills tactics, such as ticket pricing with multiple add-on fees, punitive luggage charges, self-
service check-ins and no on-board freebies.
Many analysts believe that Aer Lingus is doomed eventually to succumb to Ryanair's hostile takeover efforts.
Immediately after the Irish government offloaded 75 percent of Aer Lingus equity on to the Irish and British stock 
exchanges in September 2006, Ryanair began buying up its Irish competitor, a move that caught both Aer Lingus 
and the government off guard.
Ryanair today is Aer Lingus' top shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake, and continually criticizes the company. 
Its strategy is to buy out the government's pivotal 25 percent stake eventually. The government of Prime Minister 
Brian Cowen has repeatedly rejected the idea of a Ryanair-Aer Lingus merger, but it also is battling the worst 
budget deficit in Irish history and is desperate for cash.
Ryanair mocked Mueller's appointment and said Aer Lingus should have promoted someone from its existing 
board.
Spokesman Stephen McNamara called the German "an expert in failing airlines."
"We hope Mr. Mueller won't repeat some of his previous successes, which include the bankruptcy of Sabena or the 
folding of German low-fares airline Hapagfly," he said. The latter airline was folded into TUI's wider holiday-charter 
operations in 2007.
Mannion tried to meet Ryanair aggression with ambitious moves of his own. He negotiated hard with unions 
sometimes to the edge of strike action to trim thousands from the payroll and to raise productivity, an expensive 
process requiring hefty payoffs.
He simultaneously ordered new Airbus jets; launched Aer Lingus' first hubs outside of the Republic of Ireland in 
Belfast and London's Gatwick; and expanded the American route network and negotiated a codesharing deal with 
U.S. budget airline JetBlue in hopes of making Aer Lingus a preferred gateway for European-bound Americans.
His British hubs have yet to reach the break-even point, and he quickly had to reverse the U.S. route expansion as 
recession hit demand on both sides of the Atlantic.

Office of Fair Trading chairman Philip Collins is poised to add to his reputation as a scourge of company directors.
Plans to activate a power it has never used to disqualify board members who ignore or overlook anti-competitive 
behaviour by employees, are designed to upset the status quo.
Since the 61-year-old veteran competition lawyer joined the watchdog in 2005, turning from poacher to 
gamekeeper, he has taken on household names over anti-competitive behaviour, such as British Airways, Foxtons 
and Ryanair.
At the same time, working alongside the hyper Irish economist John Fingleton as OFT chief executive, the polished 
Mr Collins has been trying to get business leaders to comply with competition laws by engagement - through wining 
and dining.
Educated at Exeter University with a post graduate degree from Oxford, Mr Collins became a partner at Lovells as 
their expert in competition law and European law. In 1993, he moved to Brussels and later joined US law firm 
Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr.
He is a technician, as one of the founders of the Competition Law Forum established at the British Institute of

Ryanair believes that the UK's traffic and tourism decline is a direct result of the Government's GBP10 'tourist tax' 
and the charges imposed on passengers by the BAA's airports.
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Gordon Brown should now follow the example of the Belgian, Dutch, Greek 
and Spanish governments, stop taxing tourists and start welcoming them. Ryanair has already announced a freeze 
on growth from the UK. Britain's traffic and tourism losses will continue to collapse if the Government's GBP10 APD 
tourist tax is not scrapped urgently."

Aer Lingus is believed to be on the brink of announcing a new chief executive to replace Dermot Mannion. The 
appointee will face major challenges at a time when the recession is causing huge difficulties for the entire industry.
Mannion, who was appointed in 2005, stepped down last April and the board, chaired by Colm Barrington, has 
undertaken a detailed process to find a replacement. It is believed that a number of senior international candidates 
have been among those interviewed, as well as senior internal figures such as the airline's chief financial officer, 
Sean Coyle, who joined the airline a year ago from Ryanair.
Aer Lingus has recently announced cutbacks in some trans-Atlantic routes for next winter as it cuts costs in 
response to falling revenues which are threatening losses of more than  100million for this year.
The airline has suffered from falling fares and reduced passenger numbers on its trans-Atlantic services in 
particular and Barrington told shareholders at the company's recent annual general meeting that one in four trans-
Atlantic planes was effectively flying empty.
There has been intense industry speculation about the international candidates in the running for the job.
Industry observers believe that one may be Brian Dunne, who worked as chief financial officer under former chief 
executive, WillieWalsh. Dunne is now chief financial officer of ACEAviation Holdings,which owns a majority stake in 
Air Canada.However it is not clear whether Dunne is one of the final candidates being considered by the board 
subcommittee making the appointment.
Sources said that an announcement fromthe airline is ''imminent'', indicating that the board is close to finalising a 
deal with its preferred candidate.

Noel Griffin is head of group deposits with Bank of Scotland (Ireland). The bank employs 1,700 staff in Ireland with 
operations in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Belfast. It operates 44 Halifax branches nationwide.
What are the main responsibilities of your job?
My main responsibility is to drive the expansion of the deposits operation in what are difficult market conditions.
With the rates on offer from all banks continuing to drop in line with European Central Bank (ECB) rate reductions, it 
is important that depositors focus on things like their relationship with their bank and the level of service provided.
While it is my aim to ensure that our Group Deposits division continues to attract customers, it is also essential to 
ensure we attract the right type of deposit. My other primary responsibilities are to ensure that we have a robust 
strategy for the division and that we gain commitment from colleagues and develop talent for the future.
What is your primary professional motivator?
I try to be as specific as possible about my goals. Many goals are abandoned as they are either unachievable or too 
vague. Equally, I think it is important to re-assess goals if priorities change.
How would you describe your work style?
I am open and honest and I accept constructive criticism. I also try to achieve consensus through structured 
dialogue and discussion.
What would you rate as the best decision you have made in business?
I was involved in our decision to rebrand from Equity Bank to Bank of Scotland (Ireland), which as a significant and 
hugely successful move. We changed the name in early 2000 following extensive market research and benefited 
significantly by leveraging the Bank of Scotland brand subsequently.
Working week
What is the most valuable professional lesson you ever learned?
Be open to change and don't live in the past. Believe in yourself; if you don't, why should anyone else? Enjoy today.
Who do you most admire in Irish industry?
I would have to say Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair. Whether you like him or not, Ryanair has been 
incredibly successful - one of the very few Irish companies to triumph against all the odds and become a leading 
European airline. I also believe that the Ryanair model is adaptable whether the economy is in boom or bust mode.
What are your expectations for Irish business in the months ahead?
I think the short-term view has to be for continued difficult trading. The Irish economy is expected to shrink by 
perhaps 8 or 9 per cent during 2009 and unemployment is likely to reach 15 per cent. However, 2010 will mark the 
beginning of our recovery.
What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?
I would like us to play a part, however small, in repairing the country's balance sheet and reputation. This can be 
done through hard work, by making hard decisions and via an honest assessment of our actions.

Ireland and Europe's biggest no-frills airline today dispelled any doubts that it standing-in-flight idea is a "Ryanair 
joke" and has begun an online poll to gauge customer opinion.
It is asking if passengers would 'stand' on short flights if it meant they could travel for free, or pay 50pc less than 
seated passengers.
It asks passengers: If it meant your fare was free would you stand on a one hour flight?; If it meant your fare was 
half that of a seated passenger would you stand on a one hour flight? And Do you think passengers should have a 
choice of standing on short flights as they currently do on trains, buses and underground transport?
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair carries more international passengers than any other airline. Train, 
bus and underground commuters often stand for hours each day yet pay the same fare as those who get a seat. 
Ryanair passengers who are willing to stand on our one hour fights should be able to fly for free. Ryanair is asking 
passengers to take part in our online poll which will gauge passenger demand for free flights in our 'vertical seating' 
cabin".

Increasing worries that the world's biggest economy may need another huge economic stimulus before any growth 
can occur eroded gains on the Dublin shares market, though CRH helped keep the ISEQ higher.
Shares in CRH surged by over 5pc or 82c a share to E15.98 as investors looked on the bright side of its latest 
market update and bet that the second half of this year, coupled with stringent cost cuts, will boost the stock 
eventually.
Meanwhile, draft NAMA legislation is expected within weeks, paving the way for 'cleansed' Irish banks - free from 
the weight of their troublesome property loans. The next step in the process is to restore our post-NAMA 'cleansed' 
banks to profitability - a critical move if they are to help kick-start the Irish economy. Costs are a key component of 
earnings power. As declining revenues look set to take a heavy toll, we look at the option of more aggressive action 
on costs against the backdrop of what is happening in the Irish private sector generally and peers' average staff 
costs, said Davy.
Shares in AIB were flat at E1.60, Bank of Ireland edged down 2c to E1.46 and Irish Life and Permanent declined by 
1c to E3.17. Aer Lingus reported an increase in total passenger numbers of 7.5pc in June 2009 compared to June 
2008, made up of a 10.8pc increase on short haul and a 14.2pc reduction on long haul. The overall load factor in 
the month decreased by 0.2 points compared to June 2008. Short-haul load factor was 82.0pc, 0.9 points up on

CRH's latest update to the market helped push the Dublin shares index more than 80 points higher this morning.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 80.29 points to 2,678.47.
Shares in CRH surged by over 7pc or E1.08 a share to E16.24 after it said that, while the rate of profit decline in the 
second quarter eased substantially compared with the first quarter, the world recession led to weaker than 
anticipated trading in May and June. The first six months of the year is traditionally a less profitable time for the 
company. In a trading statement for the six months to June 2009, the building materials group said, however that 
while overall trading conditions are expected to remain extremely challenging, there are a number of positives 
which should make a greater impact in the seasonally more profitable second half. The statement led Davy to cut its 
forecasts but the market was relieved that the firm's situation was not worse.
Draft NAMA legislation is expected within weeks, paving the way for 'cleansed' Irish banks - free from the weight of 
their troublesome property loans. The next step in the process is to restore our post-NAMA 'cleansed' banks to 
profitability - a critical move if they are to help kick-start the Irish economy. Costs are a key component of earnings

Body
CRH's latest update to the market helped push the Dublin shares index more than 80 points higher this morning.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 80.29 points to 2,678.47.
Shares in CRH surged by over 7pc or E1.08 a share to E16.24 after it said that, while the rate of profit decline in the 
second quarter eased substantially compared with the first quarter, the world recession led to weaker than 
anticipated trading in May and June. The first six months of the year is traditionally a less profitable time for the 
company. In a trading statement for the six months to June 2009, the building materials group said, however that 
while overall trading conditions are expected to remain extremely challenging, there are a number of positives 
which should make a greater impact in the seasonally more profitable second half. The statement led Davy to cut its 
forecasts but the market was relieved that the firm's situation was not worse.
Draft NAMA legislation is expected within weeks, paving the way for 'cleansed' Irish banks - free from the weight of 
their troublesome property loans. The next step in the process is to restore our post-NAMA 'cleansed' banks to 
profitability - a critical move if they are to help kick-start the Irish economy. Costs are a key component of earnings 
power. As declining revenues look set to take a heavy toll, we look at the option of more aggressive action on costs 
against the backdrop of what is happening in the Irish private sector generally and peers' average staff costs, said 
Davy. Shares in AIB were flat at E1.60, Bank of Ireland edged down 2c to E1.46 and Irish Life and Permanent 
declined by 1c to E3.17. Aer Lingus reported an increase in total passenger numbers of 7.5pc in June 2009 
compared to June 2008, made up of a 10.8pc increase on short haul and a 14.2pc reduction on long haul. The 
overall load factor in the month decreased by 0.2 points compared to June 2008. Short-haul load factor was 82.0pc, 
0.9 points up on 2008, while capacity increased by 12.2pc year-on-year. Long-haul load factor was 80.2pc, down 
1.9 points on 2008, with capacity decreasing by 16.3pc. Shares in the airline failed to take off at E0.50 while 
Ryanair soared 14c to E3.24.

Kevin Done reports on the different comparative measures used by companies across the globe
Body
Ryanair has a strange obsession with comparing itself with British Airways.
The Irish low-cost carrier has happily adopted BA's former slogan: "The world's favourite airline".
Yesterday it combined use of the slogan with the claim "Ryanair: now twice the size of British Airways".
By some measures, the latter is true, by others it very much is not. It could just as well have said "Ryanair: quarter 
the size of British Airways".
Comparing the size of airlines is like buying an airline ticket: you pay your money and you take your choice.
"The World's Favourite Airline" was created by Saatchi & Saatchi and first used by BA in 1983 as it was preparing 
for privatisation. It was always a questionable claim - for BA then, and for Ryanair now.
BA based the claim on the fact it carried more international passengers than any other airline. That conveniently 
ignored the reality that several airlines, chiefly in the US, were much bigger than BA but derived the bulk of their 
passengers from the domestic market rather than from international routes.
The fact that the domestic US market was a large part of a continent, compared with the domestic UK market, 
which was confined to a collection of islands off the coast of mainland Europe, was overlooked.
It was as if an international passenger flying from London to Brussels (distance 319km) was somehow worth more 
than a domestic passenger flying from New York to Los Angeles (3,933km).
BA's descent down most league tables of airline size meant it had to abandon the slogan a decade ago. Ryanair is 
using the same questionable basis for its claim to have become the world's favourite airline.
Airline publicity dogfight hides the real numbers
In the latest annual statistics from the International Air Transport Association, Ryanair does top one table, namely 
for the highest number of international passengers in 2008, at 57.65m. It is just ahead of Air France-KLM at 56.32m 
and Lufthansa (including Swiss) at 54.87m.
Add domestic passengers, however, and the picture changes. Measured by total passenger numbers, Ryanair falls 
to eighth behind Delta Air Lines (including Northwest Airlines), Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, Air 
FranceKLM, Lufthansa/Swiss, United Airlines and China Southern Airlines. BA ranked 17th.
In the past 12 months Ryanair has become the biggest European short-haul carrier measured by passenger 
numbers. It is also one of the world's -fastest-growing airlines.
In June Ryanair increased its passenger numbers by 13 per cent year on year to 5.8m, setting a monthly record. By 
contrast BA's short-haul passenger numbers in June in the UK and the rest of Europe fell 5.8 per cent year on year 
to 1.81m. Its total passenger numbers worldwide fell 4.9 per cent to 2.9m.
But the yardstick of passenger numbers, a Ryanair favourite, is less than perfect. It measures neither how far the 
passenger is carried - and therefore the relative complexity of the operation - nor the revenue generated by that 
passenger.
Ryanair operates only on point-to-point, short-haul routes. BA is a network carrier with a long-haul network 
spanning the globe.
The more relevant and fairer yardsticks for BA are turnover and revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs), which 
represents the number of fare-paying passengers multiplied by the distances they fly.
In the year to the end of March, BA had a turnover of £8.99bn, while Ryanair had a turnover in the same period of 
EUR2.94bn (£2.52bn), making the Irish carrier less than 30 per cent the size of BA.
Both are dwarfed by the real giants of the industry. The top spot varies with exchange rate volatility but has Delta 
Air Lines (including Northwest ) at a pro forma $34.2bn (£21bn) in 2008 vying with the Lufthansa group at 
EUR24.9bn.
On the basis of passenger traffic, measured by RPKs, Delta was the pro forma world leader in 2008 at 285bn 
(including Northwest), followed by American at 212bn and Air France-KLM at 209bn.
On this measurement BA was eighth in the world at 115.7bn and Ryanair was back in 18th place at 62bn.
BA union woe
Cabin crew union members at British Airways yesterday rejected the company's proposals to slash costs, including 
pay freezes, new contracts for cabin crew and 3,700 job cuts, Unite union said.
The next step would be to return to the table for talks mediated by conciliation service Acas tomorrow, the union 
said.
"There was an overwhelming rejection of BA's proposals . . . [which] are quite profound," Unite said.

Eye-catching advertising slogans generate more noise than accurate statistics, writes Kevin Done
Body
Ryanair has a strange obsession with comparing itself to British Airways.
When it suits its purpose the Irish low-cost carrier has for some time been happily adopting the former tagline used 
by rival BA, describing itself as "the world's favourite airline".
Yesterday, it combined use of the advertising slogan with the claim "Ryanair now twice size of British Airways". By 
some measures, the latter is true, by others it very much is not.
Comparing the size of airlines is much like buying an airline ticket: you pays your money and you takes your choice.
"The World's Favourite Airline" slogan was created by Saatchi & Saatchi and first used by BA in 1983, as it was 
beginning to prepare for privatisation. It was always a rather questionable claim. For BA then and for Ryanair today.
BA based the claim on the fact it carried more international passengers around the world than any other airline. 
That conveniently ignored the reality that several airlines, chiefly in the US, were much bigger than BA but derived 
the bulk of their passengers from the domestic US market rather than from international routes.
BA's descent down most league tables of airline size meant it had to abandon use of the slogan a decade ago. But 
it is still easily used to lampoon BA, when it has worse punctuality and is losing more bags than most other airlines 
in Europe. That was the case a year ago, but BA has cleaned up its act in the past 12 months.
Ryanair is using the same questionable basis for its claim to have become "The World's Favourite Airline". In the 
latest annual statistics from Iata, the International Air Transport Association, Ryanair does top one table, namely for 
the highest number of international passengers in the calendar year 2008 at 57.65m. It is just ahead of Air France-
KLM at 56.32m. Add in domestic passengers, however, and the picture changes greatly. Measured by total 
Ryanair 's publicity dogfight hides reality
passenger numbers Ryanair falls to eighth place behind Delta Air Lines (including Northwest Airlines), Southwest 
Airlines, American Airlines, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa/Swiss, United Airlines and China Southern Airlines. BA 
ranks 17th.
In the midst of the global recession Ryanair is keeping the throttle open. It is still adding new aircraft, expanding 
capacity and adding routes. It has the lowest cost base in Europe and is filling its extra seats by offering the lowest 
fares. It has by far the most extensive pan-European presence of any airline.
In June, Ryanair increased its passenger numbers by 13 per cent year-on-year to 5.8m setting a new monthly 
record. By contrast, BA's short-haul passenger numbers fell by 5.8 per cent year-on-year to 1.81m. Its total 
passenger numbers worldwide fell by 4.9 per cent to 2.9m The yardstick of passenger numbers, a Ryanair 
favourite, is less than perfect as a guide to the size of an airline's operations, however. It measures neither how far 
the passenger is carried and therefore the relative complexity of the operation, nor the revenue generated by the 
passenger. Ryanair only operates on point-to-point short-haul routes. BA is a network carrier with a long-haul route 
network spanning the globe from a main hub at London Heathrow.
The more relevant and fairer yardsticks for BA are turnover and revenue passenger kilometres (RPKs), which 
represents the number of paying passengers carried multiplied by the distance flown.
In the year to the end of March, BA had a turnover of £8.99bn ($14.6bn), while Ryanair had a turnover in the same 
period of EUR2.94bn ($4.1bn), making the Irish carrier less than 30 per cent the size of BA.
Both are dwarfed by the real giants of the industry. The top spot varies with exchange rate volatility, but has Delta 
Air Lines (including Northwest Airlines) at a pro-forma $34.2bn in 2008 vying with the Lufthansa group at 
EUR24.9bn in 2008 and Air France KLM at EUR23.97bn in the year to March 2009. Both European carriers have 
significant operations in catering, cargo and engineering (maintenance, repair and overhaul) alongside their 
passenger airlines.
On the basis of passenger traffic, measured by RPKs, Delta was the pro-forma world leader in 2008 at 285bn 
(including Northwest), followed by American at 212bn and Air France-KLM at 209bn. On this measurement, BA was 
eighth in the world at 115.7bn and Ryanair in 18th place at 62bn.
If it is down to investors' assessments a very different third picture emerges of the leaders and laggards.
Based on market capitalisation, Singapore Airlines is streets ahead at $10.5bn, but Ryanair has charged up through 
the field to second place at $6.7bn, as it performs robustly through the recession.
It is the most valuable European airline ahead of Lufthansa at $5.6bn, and by this measure it certainly is "Now 
Twice Size of British Airways", which languishes at $2.4bn.
Beware lies, damned lies and airline statistics.

The Dublin shares market declined this morning in synch with bourses around Europe on worries that economic 
recovery may still be some way off.
By 10:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 37.42 points to 2,655.92.
Although the hysteria surrounding the credit-worthiness (or perceived lack thereof) of the Irish state has died down 
since its February highs, it would be a mistake for anyone to underestimate the scale of the challenge that lies 
ahead to fully convince markets that Ireland will indeed get its fiscal house in order, said Goodbody's economist, 
Dermot O'Leary. He noted that the spread of ten-year Irish Government bond yields over the German equivalent, 
for example, this morning stands at 225bps, by far the largest spread among any euro-area economy. Greece 
comes next in the pecking order with a spread of 160bps. This is despite Greece already having Government debt 
levels of over 90pc of GDP at the end of 2008, relative to c.40pc of GDP in Ireland.
This morning, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.8 percent at 827.58 points, after 
falling as far as 827.00, its lowest level since May 14. The European benchmark index is up more than 28 percent 
from its lifetime low of March 9. However, it has fallen for three straight weeks, with some analysts saying it has 
risen too fast, relative to the tangible evidence of economic recovery. The heavyweight banking sector took most 
points off the index. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Credit Suisse and HSBC were down between 0.9 and 1 
percent. Back home, banks - bellwether stocks for the state of the economy - were weaker with AIB down 5c to 
E1.60, Bank of Ireland declined by 4c to E1.50 while Irish Life and Permanent failed to move at E3.20. Ryanair 
released traffic statistics on Friday afternoon, with a 13pc increase compared to the same time last year in 
passengers in the month of June to 5.84m. This marks a new monthly record and brings the rolling twelve month 
total to a record of more than 60m passengers. The airline this morning bragged that it is now bigger than British 
Airways. Shares in the Irish no-frills airline fell by 6c to E3.18. Aer Lingus failed to take off at E0.50. Independent

from its lifetime low of March 9. However, it has fallen for three straight weeks, with some analysts saying it has 
risen too fast, relative to the tangible evidence of economic recovery. The heavyweight banking sector took most 
points off the index. BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Credit Suisse and HSBC were down between 0.9 and 1 
percent. Back home, banks - bellwether stocks for the state of the economy - were weaker with AIB down 5c to 
E1.60, Bank of Ireland declined by 4c to E1.50 while Irish Life and Permanent failed to move at E3.20. Ryanair 
released traffic statistics on Friday afternoon, with a 13pc increase compared to the same time last year in 
passengers in the month of June to 5.84m. This marks a new monthly record and brings the rolling twelve month 
total to a record of more than 60m passengers. The airline this morning bragged that it is now bigger than British

The Dublin shares market declined this morning in synch with bourses around Europe on worries that economic 
recovery may still be some way off.
By 10:30, the ISEQ had fallen by 37.42 points to 2,655.92.
Although the hysteria surrounding the credit-worthiness (or perceived lack thereof) of the Irish state has died down 
since its February highs, it would be a mistake for anyone to underestimate the scale of the challenge that lies 
ahead to fully convince markets that Ireland will indeed get its fiscal house in order, said Goodbody's economist, 
Dermot O'Leary. He noted that the spread of ten-year Irish Government bond yields over the German equivalent, 
for example, this morning stands at 225bps, by far the largest spread among any euro-area economy. Greece 
comes next in the pecking order with a spread of 160bps. This is despite Greece already having Government debt 
levels of over 90pc of GDP at the end of 2008, relative to c.40pc of GDP in Ireland.

In future some travellers on Ryanair flights could travel for free but would have to stand up or sit at modified bar-
stool type seating, according to the airline boss in a TV interview.
Michael O'Leary told Sky News the low-cost airline was considering ripping out the back few rows of seats on some 
flights.
Passengers would be able to sit on bar stools, similar to the buffet carriage on trains, or stand up for flights lasting 
less than an hour and a half.
"We might take out the last five or six rows and say to passengers 'Do you want to stand up? If you do you can 
travel for free'," Mr O'Leary said. The company has asked Boeing to look at the possibility of converting its planes or 
delivering a new fleet with "vertical seating". A Ryanair spokesman stressed the non-seating plan would have to be 
given the OK by the Irish Aviation Authority. But Mr O'Leary shrugged off suggestions the move was a cost-cut too 
far. "Why is this any different to what happens on trains where you see thousands of people who cannot get a seat 
standing in the aisles, and it happens regularly on the Underground," he said.

It said this morning it carried twice the worldwide traffic of British Airways during June.
The no-frills airline says its passenger total for the month was 5.8 million passengers.
BA, it says, carried just 2.9 million passengers, down 5pc in June. Ryanair also describes itself as "the world's 
favourite airline", a description used by British Airways for itself over many years. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara 
said: "Ryanair continues to grow traffic each month as passengers opt for Ryanair's guaranteed lowest fares and no 
fuel surcharge over BA's high fares and unjustified fuel surcharges. "Ryanair's passenger traffic grew by 13% in 
June to 5.8 million while BA's traffic fell by 5pc to 2.9 million. "Ryanair now carries twice BA's monthly worldwide

Counsel for the Irish government will today oppose an effort by Ryanair to get an EU ban on its right to bid for Aer 
Lingus lifted.
The low cost airline is seeking, in a case that starts today, to have the 2007 ruling by the European Commission 
reversed.
The case, being heard in the European Court, will consider the ruling, which was issued during Ryanair's first 
attempt to take over the former state airline.
A legal team from the state solicitor's office will represent the government at today's hearing. Aer Lingus will be 
represented separately. If the court upholds the original Commission ruling, any further bid by Ryanair for Aer 
Lingus will become next-to-near impossible.
