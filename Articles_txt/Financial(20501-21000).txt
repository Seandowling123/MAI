It will be hard for European regulators to come up with compelling reasons to block Ryanair's latest bid to take over 
rival Aer Lingus, the airline said today.
The European Commission is currently reviewing the airline's E694m offer with a decision expected in January.
The no-frills airline said it is working with up to ten other airlines and charter companies to deal with any competition 
issues that the EU watchdog might have regarding routes.
"I think it's going to be difficult for Brussels this time to come up with reasons to block it," said Ryanair spokesman, 
Stephen McNamara. Mr McNamara stood by claims made by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary in today's Irish 
Indepedent that they would offer E99 transatlantic flights if they took over Aer Lingus. He said they would look at 
revamping business class on Aer Lingus flights to attract more passengers. The airline was unveiling an additional 
daily return flight between Dublin and Brussels Charleroi from November to mark Ireland's upcoming European 
Presidency.

Body
The ISEQ made only very modest gains this morning as Europe's markets await solid news that Spain will formally 
seek aid and as data shows the continued weakness of the Irish labour market.
By 12:30, the index was up 5.05 points to 3,304.67.
European stocks pared early losses and turned flat this morning, as banking stocks rallied on expectations that 
Spain will soon request a bailout, offsetting worries about Chinese economy following grim macro data.
Meanwhile, there was a modes fall in the numbers signing on the Live Register in September but this made no 
difference to the overall weakness of the labour market with unemployment staying at 14.8pc. Ryanair rival, 
EasyJet has issued its Q4 IMS statement, upgrading its profit before tax guidance to £310-320m. It will brief later 
today on its allocated seating and digital strategy. EasyJet had previously guided profits in the £280-300m range, 
assuming cost per seat, ex-fuel, increasing 1-2pc for the second half of the year (year-end is September) and 
revenue per seat broadly in line with Q3 (Q3 was up 2.8pc on a reported basis and 4.7pc on a constant currency 
basis). The upwardly revised guidance is due to improved revenues with revenue per seat guidance now +5-5.5pc 
for the six months to end-September from low-to-mid single digits. The cost performance is broadly in line (+1.5-
2pc). Given the currency movements on reported basis, revenue per seat is likely to be 2-3pc and cost per seat, ex-
fuel, will show a 2-3.5pc reduction. Shares in Ryanair rose 4c to E4.51. Paddy Power's stocks climbed 20c to 
E59.15. Sportingbet, a takeover target of William Hill, has released full-year results to end-July 2012. Core EBITDA 
came in at £46m, in line with consensus expectations of £46.5m. Net debt at the end of July was £63m. Looking at 
the regional split of earnings, approximately 75pc of group EBITDA came from Australia (£34.8m); Europe 
accounted for £11.0m; while emerging markets accounted for £5.3m. Central costs came in at £4m.

Body
British low-cost airline easyJet's profits got an unexpected boost from sun-starved Britons taking last-minute 
holidays to flee the unusually wet weather at home this summer and from Londoners getting away after the 
Olympics.
Europe's second-largest budget airline after Ryanair said on Wednesday it now expects to report a pretax profit of 
between 310 million and 320 million pounds (dollar 516.43 million) for the year to the end of September, having 
previously predicted a result of 280 million to 300 million pounds.
"Following the end of the Olympic games demand from London increased towards the upper end of expectations 
with the late market and beach routes performing particularly well," said Chief Executive Carolyn McCall, adding 
that the carrier was "well placed to continue to succeed" despite a European economic outlook which she called 
"highly uncertain".
EasyJet, the largest carrier at London's Gatwick airport, said a strong rise in summer bookings from Britain to 
Malaga and Alicante in Spain and Faro in Portugal had helped revenue per seat by as much as 5.5 percent in the 
last six months. Annual passenger numbers by 7.1 percent to 58.4 million. Some 40 percent of easyJet's flights are 
to or from Britain, with around a quarter of its 193 plane fleet based at Gatwick. EasyJet said its performance on 
routes within mainland Europe also improved during the year, helped by growth on Swiss services and the addition 
of French regional services. Shares in easyJet, which have risen 50 percent in 2012, were up nearly 4 percent at 
615.5 pence by 0823 GMT, valuing the group at around 2.5 billion pounds. Profits have doubled since McCall took 
over as chief executive in July 2010. "McCall's second full year in charge has delivered another impressive increase 
in profits. That's no mean feat in view of the oil price," said Charles Stanley analyst Douglas McNeill. Prior to 
Wednesday's announcement analysts on average expected the airline to report a full-year pretax profit of 294.4 
million pounds, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S Estimates. EasyJet's strong performance bucks tough

conditions elsewhere in the airline sector European carriers, including Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, have seen 
recent results hit by a toxic mix of high fuel costs, weak consumer confidence and the eurozone crisis. Since the 
start of the year airlines including loss-making Spanair and Hungarian flag-carrier Malev have ceased operations, 
leaving gaps in the market that low-cost competitors have been quick to exploit. EasyJet said strict allocation of 
capital and aircraft across its network, improvements in revenue management and a tight control of costs had 
helped it absorb an additional 230 million pounds in fuel costs this year. At current fuel and exchange rates the 
budget carrier, which has already bought 77 percent of the fuel it needs for next year, expects its 2012/13 fuel bill to 
rise by up to 40 million pounds. The carrier said second half costs per seat were likely to rise by between 1.5 and 2 
percent, excluding fuel. A third of seats in the first quarter of its new fiscal year had already been sold, the airline 
said. ( C) Reuters

Highlight: Ryanair, a provider of passenger transportation services, has announced that passengers who 
experience very rare Ryanair flight delays, of over 90 minutes, will receive free text message updates to advise 
them of the likely duration of the delay and their new departure time.
Body
The service developed in partnership with Sentient, a new addition to Ryanair's existing email/text and website 
passenger communications and will be particularly useful during periods of severe disruption such as bad weather, 
ATC strikes or widespread airspace closures. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "Ryanair delivers Europe's No 1 
customer service and our new text alerts system will ensure we stay No 1. Now passengers who have provided us 
with complete mobile numbers will receive real-time information if they experience a rare flight delay of over 90 
minutes. "The latest SITA study found an estimated 95% of airline passengers carry a mobile phone when they 
travel and our new system will ensure passengers are kept fully informed during periods of mass disruption, such 
as bad weather, air traffic control strikes or airspace closures." Sentient's Derek Corcoran said: "Sentient worked 
closely with Ryanair to design a pan global messaging application to ensure timely and accurate information for 
passengers, delivering real-time flight information via multi-lingual SMS."

Boeing has publicly announced its intention to produce Boeing business jet (BBJ) versions on the 737 MAX.
The manufacturer intends to offer BBJ Max 8 and BBJ Max 9 based on the 737 Max 8 and 9.
The announcement was made at the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) conference in Orlando.
Last month at the ISTAT event in Rome, Ryanair's CFO Howard Millar said he was not convinced whether the 
Max's increased cost will offset fuel savings.
In October this year Alaska Airlines ordered 20 MAX 8s,17 MAX 9s and 13 737-900ERs, bringing the total number 
of MAX orders to 858 airplanes.

Highlight: The low cost carrier has reported a Eu596 million profit for the first half of fiscal 2013.
Body
Dublin-based Ryanair has posted an after tax profit of Eu596 million ($764 million) for the first half of fiscal year 
2013, a 10% year to year increase.
Revenue was Eu3.1 billion, up from Eu2.7 billion for the same period last year.
The carrier's profits occur at a time of distress for many other short-haul European carriers. This summer rival short-
haul airlines Windjet, OLT Express, and bmibaby closed down due to the tough operating market within Europe.
Ryanair stated that the loss of these rivals, the earlier collapse of both Malev and Spanair in 2012 and proposed 
reductions by legacy carriers including KLM, IAG, Lufthansa, SAS, and Air Berlin of their short-haul operations is an 
opportunity for the low-cost carrier. Ryanair states over the next ten years it will target more than an 18% market 
share of the EU short-haul market increasing its traffic by 50% to 120m passengers per annum.
In July, Ryanair reported a profit of Eu99 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, 29% down from the same 
period a year ago.

The clanging of fenders is getting louder. First, Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne accuses Volkswagen of creating a 
"bloodbath" for carmakers in Europe by waging a price war. Now Hans Dieter Poetsch, VW's finance chief, is 
declaring that some rivals risk going out of business without government aid. "Especially carmakers in southern 
Europe that produce small cars," he added pointedly yesterday. Had anyone failed to notice the dire state of 
Europe's auto industry - struggling to sell 13m cars in western Europe this year, compared with 17m in 2007 - they 
have now been alerted.
Even so, the ferocity of these punches is unusual. True, consumer product companies run innumerable ads 
comparing the efficacy of their merchandise with that of rivals. But they tend to be coy about naming competitors 
directly and rarely take vicious slugs at each other's balance sheets. Even warring tech sector executives focus 
their insults on the product. Apple's Steve Jobs once told arch-rival Microsoft it had "no taste". Damming, perhaps, 
but hardly lethal.
But if car companies really want to get ugly, they should look skyward. For decades, bosses in the airline industry 
have swiped at each other's companies with brutal directness. Ryanair's Michael O'Leary once accused the British 
Airways board of having "no spine, no balls and no vision". Richard Branson justified the founding of Virgin Atlantic 
by declaring: "I decided there must be room for another airline when I spent two days trying to get through to 
People Express."
Investors, though, may sense a correlation. Could it be that the more vindictive the mudslinging, the worse the 
industry dynamics? Airline economics were once described by a top US executive as "sheer hell". Much the same 
could be said for those of the European car sector at present. Investors may wish to apply a politeness test.

Ireland will miss out on a new generation of heavyweight plcs unless our enterprise policy encourages domestic 
businesses to achieve bigger scale, Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) Chief Executive, Deirdre Somers, said today.
The statement comes after a spate of top level Irish companies de-listed from the ISE in favour of a listing on the far 
bigger London market.
Speaking at the "Irish Enterprise - Funding for Growth" conference in Dublin, Ms Somers said government policy on 
creating new businesses rightly receives considerable attention but that medium-sized companies needed greater 
support to address the challenges facing them specifically. The conference, organised by the ISE in co-operation 
with Enterprise Ireland, was attended by 300 delegates and 180 high-growth companies.
"Ireland has one of the highest levels of business start-ups in the EU but the vast majority of companies sell at a 
relatively early stage", said Ms Somers. "The Government's enterprise policy should include an ambition to build at 
least 5 to 10 companies to scale with a market capitalisation of over E1 billion in the next five years whether through 
organic growth and/or acquisition". "Encouraging entrepreneurship is not an end in itself. The end must be creating 
companies that have scale and importance on a global stage and which will contribute economically to Ireland for 
decades to come," she said. Ms Somers said it is right to celebrate successful home-grown companies achieving 
lucrative trade sales but that trade sales should not be seen as the best or only option available to the owners of 
such businesses. "At a national policy level, we need to start redefining success by a different metric, a different 
and bigger ambition," she said. "Right now, Ireland has companies that have the business proposition, capability 
and ambition to be the next Ryanair, Kerry Group or Paddy Power. There are many others that can benefit from the 
funding options, flexibilities and exits provided by the stock market."

Capt Baczkowski (Flight International, 4-10 September) states he could handle the loss of all screens. However, the 
crew of AF447 could not handle the loss of speed indicators, as had happened before in other accidents.
The reason is that training of new pilots is still the same as in the old days, with needles pointing at digits, ignoring 
the fact that the brain has to work completely differently in different cockpits.
Analysing my position in space by reading digits is a mathematical, analytical process and it ends with an image of 
my position. Looking at pictures - my position on a screen - requires nothing! It is like watching TV: very relaxing. 
Some people even go to sleep in front of it.
Well-trained older brains remain in conscious mode even when pictures of flight directors show erratic values. They 
are able to analyse consciously their real situation. Thus they are immediately able to switch on their motor system 
in a controlled mode and therefore can control the airplane.Since the introduction of automation and 
computerisation the new-generation brains are no longer in conscious mode, but in consuming mode. What 
accident investigators call "automation complacency" leads very often to loss of awareness.
Capt Awad Thomas Fakoussa
Mossautal, Germany
Refusing to revert to type
I have resisted writing in with my opinion for a while, but I feel I must add my thoughts about Airbus-bashing on this 
page.
Contrary to popular belief, you can see what the other pilot is doing with his flight controls in an Airbus by looking 
across the flightdeck. Even in the circumstances encountered by the AF447 crew, if the pilot not flying had looked 
across he would have seen the full back stick demanded by the pilot flying.
Training brainwave
In the Colgan Air accident, back pressure was being applied by the captain. It is reasonable to assume that the first 
officer could see this yet didn't intervene. As for lack of feedback from the autothrottle: did movement of the thrust 
levers help the Turkish Airlines crew in a Boeing 737 that crashed at Amsterdam? No.
Aircraft design is not the issue. Boeing, Airbus et al have their differences but get the same job done in a different 
way. When pilot error is deemed the cause of an accident, the real issue comes down to the crew in terms of their 
competence, training, level of fatigue and even whether a different crew faced with the same set of circumstances 
would have provided a different outcome.
Think Hudson ditching and BA038 as two examples of crews getting it right, regardless of what they were flying!
Dan Bealey
Crawley, UK
Doors of perception
The answer to Ryanair's entry problem (Flight International, 7-13 August) is simple and cheap. Firstly, do the same 
as EasyJet and use both forward and aft entry doors: it cannot be too expensive, and who cares if the steerage 
class gets wet! They could even be charged for towels or drying the seats. Ryanair would love that!
Secondly, give the self-loading cargo seat numbers and ensure they board in strict number order - none of this "we 
are now boarding those in row 35, and premier, club, freeloader class, and you lot with selective hearing" which 
blocks row 1, causing a jam. They could be fined for jumping the queue. Ryanair would love this too!

Three of the budget carrier's 737-800s were among several aircraft caught up in the weather chaos
Ryanair crews exonerated over Valencia emergency calls as probe reveals effect of storms
Investigators are recommending that Spanish authorities review fuel advice for Madrid-bound flights after three 
Ryanair weather diversions to Valencia each resulted in pilots declaring a fuel emergency. The 26 July diversion of 
the Boeing 737-800s sparked controversy because the budget airline appeared to be singled out for criticism in 
Spain.
Ryanair publicly denounced various Spanish-led claims over the nature of the Valencia event as false, and 
highlighted similar cases involving other carriers which had not attracted the same attention. Investigators found a 
LAN Airbus A340 had also declared an emergency at Valencia.
In a joint probe with Spanish air safety agency AESA, the Irish Aviation Authority says weather forecasts indicated a 
40% chance of thunderstorms in Madrid when the three flights - inbound from Palma, London and Stockholm - were 
scheduled to arrive. All three flights departed for Madrid and diverted to Valencia with fuel "in excess" of 
requirements, the inquiry says.
On approach to Madrid, the Palma flight executed a go-around and was hit by lightning. The crew diverted when 
remaining fuel reached 2,900kg (6,400lb) but vectoring around weather added 40-50nm (75-90km) to the nominal 
150nm route. The aircraft was too high on arrival and more vectors were needed - even after it had been cleared for 
immediate approach after its emergency call.
The London flight discontinued its approach to Madrid after seeing preceding aircraft go around, and diverted, with 
2,900kg of fuel, after weather prevented it following vectors to a holding point. It similarly experienced a prolonged 
flight to Valencia, and the captain indicated to the inquiry that Valencia air traffic control seemed "overwhelmed" 
with the traffic - at one point confusing the Ryanair flight with a LAN aircraft, adding to the workload.
Spanish diversions inquiry advises Madrid fuel rethinkHeadline to come headline to come headline to
The Stockholm flight, after going around, initially asked to hold east of Madrid but this subsequently became 
impossible. It was instead directed west, and diverted when fuel reached 2,600kg, declaring an emergency after 
noting that air traffic control was advising flights of 35min delays.
All the Ryanair crews declared emergencies in accordance with European operational requirements, says the 
inquiry, once calculated usable fuel for landing dipped below final reserve. But it also points out that diverting with 
fuel "close to" the minimum diversion fuel, given the circumstances, was "likely to present challenges" to the crews - 
particularly given that holding points southwest of Madrid increased diversion time to Valencia. The latter's 
controllers, it adds, were "under significant pressure" from the number of diversions to the airport.
Investigators are recommending that AESA reviews delays at Madrid to see whether additional fuel ought to be 
required - particularly given that "extensive" vectoring and holding often occurs when Madrid's southerly runways 
are in use.

Ryanair said it is confident of winning regulatory clearance for its bid for Aer Lingus after the submission of a 
"revolutionary" package of remedies to the European Commission to address competition concerns.
It also warned yesterday that if its EUR1.30-per-share bid for the Irish flag carrier was blocked by Brussels , it would 
sell its stake.
"If the commission turns down this remedies package then I think we would have to seriously consider exiting our 
investment in Aer Lingus, which without question would result in Aer Lingus being broken up," said Michael 
O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, at the company's annual meeting in Dublin.
He said Ryanair had received bids for its 29.9 per cent stake from financial buyers. He would not give further 
details, except that some of the approaches had been made within the past three months.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair's draft remedies package involved getting other airlines to commit to take over 35 routes to 
Europe where the proposed takeover would result in a monopoly situation. He said it went far beyond remedies 
accepted by the commission in previous airline deals.
Talks between Ryanair, Brussels and other airlines would continue until the end of October and Mr O'Leary was 
hopeful of a decision before Christmas.
"I remain confident that our revolutionary remedies package will win approval in Brussels and that we will be able to 
acquire in time and significantly grow Aer Lingus and have two decent-sized Irish airlines running around Europe 
kicking the crap out of the competition," he said.

Body
Ryanair warned today that Aer Lingus would likely be broken up if the European Commission blocks the bid by 
Europe's largest budget carrier to take over its smaller rival.
The commission, which acts as the European Union's anti-monopoly watchdog, is due to rule by January whether 
Ryanair's third attempt to take over Aer Lingus would restrict competition.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair had received approaches by financial institutions to buy its 30 
percent in Aer Lingus and said it may sell it if the commission rejects a package of remedies to address its 
competition concerns.
He declined to give details of the approaches. "If the commission turns down this remedies package, then I think we 
would then have to seriously consider exiting our investment in Aer Lingus, which will without question result in Aer 
Lingus being broken up," O'Leary told journalists on the sidelines of the company's annual shareholders' meeting. 
The remedies package includes commitments by more than one airline to compete on routes where Ryanair and 
Aer Lingus currently have no competitors. The commission will talk to the airlines in question before Ryanair 
submits its final remedies package, O'Leary said. "They have said that they want to take up the packages of the 
routes and flights and traffic that we have laid on the table. None of them can formally commit until they sit down 
and discuss it with the European Commission," he said. The package would see "multiple airlines" starting new 
routes to Irish airports in Cork, Shannon, Dublin and Knock. O'Leary declined to name the airlines, but a source 
familiar with the matter has told Reuters the company was talking to British Airways and Virgin Atlantic about taking 
over some routes. Aer Lingus has said it expected the commission to reject the bid as the number of routes on 
which the two airlines compete was higher than when the Commission rejected an earlier bid. The Irish government 
has said it is interested in selling its 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus.

¦ Aviation watchdogs have cleared Ryanair of breaching safety rules after three emergency landings in Valencia in 
July, but recommended that the airline and the Spanish authorities review their fuel policies. The planes were 
carrying sufficient fuel when they departed from Madrid, but after diversions during thunderstorms made Mayday 
calls as fuel dropped close to the minimum levels. The Irish Aviation Authority yesterday said Ryanair acted 
correctly, but should consider diversion training

Authorities in Spain have cleared Ryanair of accusations that it flew several aiorcraft without enough fuel in their 
tanks, compromising passenger safety.
Today's report into three emergency landings due to low fuel by Ryanair planes at Valencia airport last July has 
found the aircraft involved departed with sufficient fuel for their flight plan.
The flights (from Stockholm, London and Palma to Madrid on July 26th) were diverted to Valencia after 
thunderstorms around Madrid caused delays. The three aircraft declared an emergency when the calculated usable 
fuel for landing at Valencia was less than the final reserve.
"Ryanair welcomes this report which conclusively disproves the recent false claims in the Spanish media that 
Ryanair's aircraft carried less than minimum fuel and/or were in breach of EU regulations," the airline said. . Ryanair 
also welcomed this week's joint statement of the Irish and Spanish Transport Ministries which confirmed that 
"Ryanair's safety standards are on a par with the safest airlines in Europe". The Irish Aviation Authority's (IAA) 
report, released by Ryanair, found the crew followed EU safety guidelines and the aircraft had fuel "in excess of 
flight plan requirements" when they departed for Madrid. The IAA said although the crew diverted to Valencia with 
fuel "in excess of the minimum diversion fuel depicted on the flight plan" the increased holding time south west of 
Madrid ahead of rerouting meant the crew "declared an emergency in accordance with EU-OPS when the 
calculated usable fuel for landing at Valencia was less than final reserve".

German airline group Deutsche Lufthansa AG says it will combine many of its European short-haul flights with its 
Germanwings budget carrier as part of a wider cost-reduction effort.
The company says the new carrier will have about 90 planes and start operating in January, flying some 18 million 
passengers annually.
Lufthansa said in a statement late Wednesday that the new division, whose name has yet to be decided, will take 
over all domestic and European short-haul flights outside the airline's main hubs Frankfurt and Munich.
Lufthansa CEO Christoph Franz said the restructuring will help achieve "significant efficiency gains."
The Cologne-based group, which includes Swiss and Austrian Airlines, is currently implementing an ambitious cost-
cutting program as it struggles to compete with European low-cost carriers such as Easyjet or Ryanair.

The interim results of JD Sports were expected to disappoint when compared with July full-year numbers from rival 
sportswear retailer Sports Direct. And how. Profits before tax fell 85 per cent to £2.9m. Sports Direct, the creation of 
entrepreneur Mike Ashley, produced a profits increase of 24 per cent to £151m.
JD was held back by a £10m loss at Blacks, an outdoor retailer acquired for about £20m. But profits from 
sportswear retailing, where JD targets more affluent customers, were also down. The business, led by executive 
chairman Peter Cowgill, has just pulled out of bidding for JJB Sports, a faltering rival.
JD is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Demand for its premium sportswear is weaker than for the cheap gear 
Sports Direct sells through big, sometimes chaotic stores. The depressed UK economy may be partly responsible. 
But so may the hefty incentives Sports Direct pays staff.
The Ryanair of sportswear would probably convert the best stores and sell the rest if it bought JJB. The fit would be 
more problematic for JD. But the jump into retailing tents and cagoules via Blacks appears equally risky. Its shares 
will stay at a heavy discount - the forward earnings multiple is seven times against Sports Direct at 14.9 times - until 
diversification shows signs of paying off.

Irish authorities have given an assurance to Spain of the Irish Aviation Authority's (IAA) rigorous oversight of 
Ryanair's operations and on their satisfaction with Ryanair's safety standards which are on a par with the safest 
airlines in Europe.
The reassurance came after three Ryanair planes were last week forced to make emergency landings.
Spanish transport official Rafael Catala said Spain had requested immediate talks with European transport

EasyJet is hoping to profit from the government's cost-cutting drive, striking a deal this week with the House of 
Commons' travel agency that will allow MPs and their staff to book journeys on the budget airline as easily as they 
do with the likes of British Airways.
While MPs travelling for work have always been able to buy tickets with low-cost carriers and expense them, this 
contract - which also covers the House of Lords - offers discounts on easyJet fares and greater flexibility to change 
booked journeys.
Andrew Burch at Hillgate Travel, which won the contract to run parliament's travel office in 2009, said easyJet had 
approached Hillgate in search of big corporate clients looking to reduce travel costs. That the House of Commons 
signed on "demonstrates they run their business as a business," he added.
It is not unusual for budget carriers to be left out of the equation when people book flights through a company travel 
agent, since few have contracts with the agents or the organisations. Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, 
criticised Brussels this spring for using a flight-booking system that rules out budget airlines. "This prohibition is a 
blatant subsidy to EU flag carriers and discriminates yet again against Europe's low-fares airlines," he said.
EasyJet has taken a more low-key approach, but is keen to attract business customers, who often book closer to 
the date of travel and then pay higher fares.
The company pointed out yesterday that it already counts many MPs as customers, including 80 it carried for free 
last summer, as they attempted to return quickly from holiday for an emergency session of the House of Commons 
following the widespread rioting.

Big story
The decision by US Federal Reserve chairman **Ben Bernanke**to flush yet more money into the American 
economy surprised markets, which were expecting a much more modest commitment. Bernanke said the Fed 
would buy $40 billion worth of mortgage-backed bonds every month -- indefinitely -- until unemployment started 
coming down and the US economy started recovering.
The move sent stock and commodity prices soaring as investors sought risk assets. Combined with earlier 
commitments by the ECB to backstop the funding of key peripheral countries, the Fed's action buoyed investor 
sentiment, persuading markets that disaster has been averted -- for now.
With US interest rates set to remain at historic lows for another three years, savers don't have much choice but to 
take on some risk and buy, buy, buy -- unless they want to lose ground in a zero-rate environment.
.........................
**Bull market**
The recovery in market sentiment has helped nobody as much as the **NTMA**. Ireland's debt agency raised 
another EUR 500 million in treasury bills last Thursday, repeating a trick they first pulled in July when markets 
warmed to Ireland's prospects following a European Council commitment to consider restructuring Ireland's bank 
debt.
The NTMA has since gone from strength to strength as the agency turned a PR stunt into an opportunistic pre-
funding programme. At this stage, Ireland has raised EUR 14 billion this year, cutting its rollover burden to just EUR 
2.3 billion for next year. It's not full market access, but with ECB backing and the prospect of a debt deal, favourable 
conditions appear to be converging.
Market Week
.........................
**Bear market**
If you want to feel depressed, talk to an economist. Last week, the **Fiscal Advisory Council**poured some cold 
water on the government's belief that it is fully in control of the country's budgetary adjustment. The group of wise 
men -- in their third quarterly report -- said the government should look to take an extra EUR 1.9 billion out of the 
next three budgets. There was already EUR 8.6 billion on the agreed schedule, but the council pointed out that 
growth projections have been consistently over-optimistic and that 3 per cent per annum was a hard target to hit.
The recommendations are not binding, so we can expect them to be ignored. But when the tax hikes and spending 
cuts creep up on you, don't say you weren't warned.
.........................
**Coming up**
**Irish GDP numbers**for the second quarter are out next week. The economy shrank 1.1 per cent quarter-on-
quarter in the three months to July. Another quarter like that means recession. On an annual basis, the economy 
grew, though, so it will be open to argument.
Food company **Origin Enterprises**has annual results on Wednesday, while **Ryanair**holds its annual general 
meeting on Friday.

Regarding your story "Learjet 60XR iced as weak market depresses demand" (Flight International, 7-13 August): 
can we please have a return to plain English? The subject headline is meaningless. What I believe was meant was: 
"Learjet 60XR production stopped".
Likewise, here in Europe, companies sign contracts - not "ink" them. Another meaningless phrase that is creeping 
in.
Although aerospace is a multinational industry, we do not have to ape the cold-blooded murder of the English 
tongue as practised in other countries.

Side issue
In response to a plethora of letters on the AF447 accident, people seem to have overlooked some of the basic 
principles of flight: no matter what aircraft you fly, if it stalls the angle of attack will be extremely high. Tragically, the 
A330 had the ability to display Alpha or angle of attack on the primary flight display, but flying "alpha" is 
predominantly a skill used by military pilots. I'm sure that had the three pilots had an AOA gauge they would have 
seen straight away that even with full power the wings were stalled and the only way to unstall the wings would be 
to "unload", not keep pulling the sidestick back. The arguments about sidestick versus yoke are only valid in the 
sense that with a yoke you tend to know where the neutral point is by both feel and visual reference - something a 
sidestick won't show you. The bottom line, however, is all aircraft should display AOA and pilots be trained how to 
fly with reference to AOA alone.

Doubling up
It would seem that once again Ryanair is displaying a somewhat tenuous grasp of the practicalities of aircraft 
design ("Ryanair proposes wider doors to speed C919 boarding", Flight International, 7-13 August).
Having a double-width door may well get the passengers to the top of the stairs in pairs, but then what? A 
narrowbody is, by definition, narrow, with a single-file aisle. It seems that instead of bunching on the apron at the 
foot of the stairs, the passengers would bunch instead inside the entry door. This might keep some of them out of 
the rain, but would not speed up the boarding process.
A double-width airstair would bring a weight penalty, or alternatively mean having to provide two sets of steps and 
an increased ground-handling charge.
This idea ranks alongside other Ryanair wheezes such as removing the toilets to increase capacity, or even the 
seats, requiring the passengers to stand and hang on to overhead straps.

So Ryanair proposes wider doors to speed C919 boarding (Flight International, 7-13 August). What will be the next

Michael O'Leary says a successful Comac will benefit all carriers
Irish carrier reaffirms interest in 199-seat variant of Chinese narrowbody but is negotiating with Boeing on near-term 
deal
Low-cost carrier Ryanair has reiterated that its discussions with Chinese airframer Comac on the potential 
development of a stretched 199-seat variant of its C919 twinjet are serious and could still yield an order for delivery 
in the 2018-20 timeframe.
Industry observers have been quick to brand Ryanair's flirtation with the Chinese company as little more than a 
means of beating down incumbent aircraft supplier Boeing on price. The final delivery under its current order for 
189-seat ­737­800s is due to take place later this year.
However, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary insists the airline's talks with Comac represent "a genuine, 
serious commitment". He believes that all ­carriers should welcome the emergence of the state-owned airframer as 
a serious player in commercial aviation - "a real, credible third manufacturer" in the mainline narrowbody market - 
as it will serve to drive down prices.
"It's a great deal for airlines all around the world," he says. "If, all of a sudden, we are all buying Chinese-built 
aircraft, then Airbus and Boeing's pricing strategy gets holed below the waterline."
Interest in the C919 was revealed by British Airways parent International Airlines Group at the Farnborough air 
show in July, where it signed a memorandum of understanding to work with Comac on the development of the CFM 
International Leap-1C-powered C919. O'Leary says IAG's move only serves to add "credibility" to the programme.
Ryanair still keen to take stretched C919 from ComacRyanair still keen on stretched C919 Irish carrier reaffirms 
interest in 199-seat variant of Chinese narrowb....
Any order from Ryanair, however, is contingent on Comac agreeing to make a stretched variant of the C919. The 
baseline model is due to enter service in 2016 with up to 168 seats in an all-economy configuration.
Nonetheless, Ryanair is continuing its discussions with Boeing over a potential new near-term order. O'Leary says 
price is the main sticking point, although he has again expressed his concerns over the design of the ­re­engined 
737 Max, citing the weight increase over the current-generation 737-800 as a particular worry.
He adds, however: "We are in ongoing discussions with Boeing and as soon as we can reach an agreement on 
price we'll place an order. It could be the -800 or the Max: whichever they discount the most. We'd like to place an 
order, but only when the price is right."

IT'S ONE of those dilemmas that make you bone-deep thankful to be born in the twenty-first century, austerity 
notwithstanding. Two hundred years ago my ancestors faced problems like: "Will I be transported to a hellish penal 
colony if I steal that pie to feed my children?". One hundred years ago: "Those Germans are looking feisty, should I 
enlist?" Today: "Hmm. Is it better to rent a villa or stay in a hotel when you are going on holiday with small 
children?" An intractable, thorny dilemma. In a villa you have privacy, space and somewhere to sit out and drink 
your own body-weight in rosé while they sleep; in a hotel someone else does the cooking and cleaning, but when 
the kids go to bed, the parents are stuck in the bedroom. It's a conundrum, and the Senior family selflessly 
volunteered for a holiday experiment to attempt to solve it. With one 18 month old, one four-year-old and some 
nerves frayed ragged by a dawn Ryanair flight, we arrived in Puglia at the southern tip of Italy to find out.
Puglia has some incredible things to offer - the food is amazing, the beaches are good, the towns are stunning, but 
the countryside is a bit disappointing. It's flat and agricultural - the Norfolk of southern Italy, but with better food.
If we were underwhelmed by the scenery, however, we were overwhelmed by our hotel. The Masseria Torre 
Coccaro is an old fortified farmhouse, converted into a five star hotel. It is understated and elegant. It takes a huge 
amount of behind-the-scenes work to be this good. Flowers tumble in artfully artless ways wherever you turn, the 
whitewash on the Masseria walls is hurt-your-eyes fresh. The staff are expensively charming, and the food at both 
the formal and informal restaurants is excellent. Breakfasts are a good test of how luxurious hotels are, and this one 
was a peach - Parma ham, artisanal cheeses, freshly squeezed orange juice, home-made yoghurt, platters of 
chilled fresh fruit and a dizzying selection of homebaked cakes, amongst many other delights.
Puglia takes on the family challenge Antonia Senior attempts to solve the eternal riddle: what is better, a fancy 
hotel or a well appointed villa?
But this is also a haven for children. Those expensive staff chuckle when the rampaging kids check their path, smile 
indulgently when a defiant baby chucks risotto on the floor. The pool is made to resemble a beach, so it gets deep 
only very slowly, and just off the pool area there is a kids' play area with sand and a giant trampoline.
In the days we were there, our daughter joined a pack of five or six English kids that ran together from morning to 
late into the night. They spent most of their time being pirates, or so it seemed when the baby refused to be fobbed 
off with a bucket of water and I was forced to look up from my Kindle. In the evenings, not wanting to leave them 
alone in our two stunning rooms, they came to the restaurant with us. Imagine white-clothed tables lit by candles, 
sitting among the flowers and olive trees - and some slightly feral children shouting: "Yo ho mateys away!".
Of the Senior clan, then, the oldest child would definitely vote for hotel. She had the best holiday ever in the whole 
world, apparently - although we were lucky with the ages of the children.
The Masseria Torre Coccaro does have a kids' club based out of its lovely beach club, 3kms down the road, but the 
children seemed happy enough entertaining themselves by the very safe pool. In another of those small touches 
that distinguish a truly lovely hotel from a merely luxurious one, the Masseria has loads of bikes to borrow (and 
even a bike man to check the saddle is tight before you set off). We cycled to the Beach Club through endless 
groves of twisted olive trees, bent like resigned old men with daisyflecked feet.
Much to our eldest's distress, we left the Masseria, travelling further south - almost to the heel of the boot. On the 
drive down we agreed. Nothing could beat the Masseria; dilemma solved. A little voice from the back agreed 
emphatically. And then we arrived at the Villa Specchia.
On the edge of the beautiful medieval hill-town of Specchia, the villa sits in its own walled garden, which is bigger 
than our local park. Mostly on one level, with polished parquet floors and antique furniture, the inside is stunning. 
But the star of the show is the covered loggia, with a view across the grounds to the swimming pool and the 
weeping willows beyond. Oh, and the maid. Did I mention the maid, Cosimina, who made us dinner on our first 
night, breakfast every morning, and cleaned as well? The very welcome presence of Cosimina transformed the villa 
experience.
Without the domestic baggage that comes with self-catering, we were free to concentrate on the important things, 
like creeping upon the frogs in the pond at the bottom of the garden, sending them hopping into the water to 
delighted gurgles from the baby. Like lying under the shade of a willow tree reading, or wandering into town for a 
plate of antipasti and grilled meats from the little restaurant next to the butchers. Even, reluctantly, venturing out 
down the road to the sea, joining the throngs of Italian day-trippers diving from the rocky coast into the sparkling 
Adriatic.
None of this loveliness helped us come to any conclusions. I liked the privacy of the villa: no fear of small talk 
between the pool and the bar. Lara preferred being with the gang at the Hotel. The baby seemed happy in any 
place which had ice cream; which pretty much summed up my husband's attitude to the excellent local wine. So 
home again, none the wiser, but fatter, browner and happier. We'll have to try to crack the conundrum another time. 
It's the dilemma that keeps on giving.

Let the whole country fly RyanEire

It has been so brilliant to have Ryanair's ongoing bid to take over Aer Lingus back in the news throughout the 
summer. This is not just because it is important that we keep banging on about the airline and its publicity-shy boss, 
Michael O'Leary.
It is also because it is a timely reminder of how the pursuit of profit is one of the things that made this nation so 
great. As has been pointed out before, it was the pursuit of profit that drove the Celtic tiger forward and turned 
Ireland into a model for countries all over the world. That pride in our economy during the boom years is the one 
thing they will never ever be able to take away from us.
However, it is also possible that O'Leary doesn't want to take over Aer Lingus just for the sake of making more 
money for Ryanair shareholders. Maybe he really does want to make the former national carrier into a better airline. 
Maybe he really does want to provide the best possible service. Maybe he really will put the passengers first.
And maybe Boeing will start selling pigs with little wings who can fly alongside every RyanAerLingus flight.
It has also been discussed before that Ryanair should be allowed to buy our health service in order to turn it into an 
efficient money-making operation. To be fair to O'Leary, he probably couldn't make it any worse than it already is.
The proposal document for that takeover from 2009 read as follows: "If you are ill or were in an accident over the 
weekend, just turn up at a Ryanhealth hospital on Monday morning. As soon as the doors of the hospital are 
opened, which could be at any time that day, all customers must rush towards the department they need. The 
service will then work on a 'first come, first served' basis.
"Diagnoses will cost just EUR 1 each (plus outrageous government taxes), while all the little extras such as lottery 
tickets, smokeless cigarettes, water, medicine, surgery and beds will be charged separately."
But now, with the country spiralling further into debt as each hour passes, it is perhaps time that we looked more 
seriously at selling various bits and pieces of Ireland Inc to Ryanair. We need the cash and we need it now.
Let the whole country fly RyanEire
**Public transport**
We should sell all of Ireland's taxi plates to Ryanair immediately so it can take over the running of the entire fleet. 
Being honest, the only real difference between flying Ryanair and taking a ride in an Irish taxi is the high fares we 
pay in taxis. The rest of the experience is eerily similar, so it's unlikely we would even notice the change of 
ownership.
O'Leary is himself a former taxi driver, so could drive a lot of the cabs himself.
It might also be time that we sold Iarnród   ireann, the Dart and Bus   ireann to the low-fares airline. Imagine how 
much short-term cash we could make from selling off such an unnecessary part of our national transport 
infrastructure.
As for Ryanair, it would surely be able to turn them into profit-making enterprises simply by packing even more 
people onto trains, buses and Darts.
In fact, if we agreed to throw in ownership of all our roads (and Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar) for a few quid 
more, Ryanair could just force everyone to travel by 'public transport' by making it really expensive to use one of its 
roads.
Also, most trains, Darts and buses already offer a minimal on-board service and only get you to near where you 
really want to go, so it would be a good fit for the Ryanair model.
**Bord Gáis and ESB**
The two energy suppliers have long been touted as possible elements of a fire sale. There is no reason whatsoever 
why a government should own and control things such as gas and electricity, the provision of which barely even 
counts as a basic human right in this glorious age of austerity.
If we sold them both now, we could get rich really quickly -- and then get poor just as quickly by using the cash to 
help pay the huge gambling debts we all ran up during the boom years.
**Museums and parks**
Did you know that a lot of our museums and parks are still free to enter? It is unknown how this bizarre scenario still 
exists in 2012, but it surely represents a huge opportunity for Ireland to make a quick sale of a business which is 
rather useless but which has lots of potential.
An operator like Ryanair could start charging people to enter museums. It could then develop a fair and reasonable 
pricing structure based on the number of pictures you looked at and for how long. It could also open up plenty of 
advertising and sponsorship opportunities.
To be fair to the people of Ireland, Ryanair should keep entry prices to parks very low and only charge for extras, 
such as bringing children or animals in with you, eating your lunch on the grass and enjoying the peace and quiet.
**Coillte**
Let's be honest: which is more important these days, money or trees? Coillte, the national tree association, owns 
huge numbers of trees which pretty much stand around all day doing nothing. Let's sell all our forests and make 
some money.
Ryanair could chop them all down and use them as fuel to fly its planes, on which we could then travel more 
cheaply when emigrating. It's a win-win situation for everyone. And the great thing about trees is that they grow 
back. You can't say the same about money.
**Education system**
Let the whole country fly RyanEire
At the moment, we are educating our young at great cost to the exchequer and yet most of them, if we teach them 
well enough, will emigrate. Let's offload (sorry, sell) all our school and colleges to Ryanair. It could turn an 
expensive and clunky system into a lean, mean educating machine overnight.
Instead of having lots of students being taught lots of subjects, many of which are worse than useless for making 
money, there could just be one big computer screen with a Michael O'Leary avatar banging on about the 
importance of keeping costs down, about how great he is and about how dressing casually is the key to good 
management.
**The public sector**
How much do you think we would get if we sold the entire public sector, including all civil servants, to Ryanair? EUR 
10 million? EUR 1 million? Whatever the airline would be willing to pay, it might just be worth it on several different 
fronts.
For a start, what would Michael O'Leary make of the Croke Park deal? Secondly, if he were to take over the entire 
civil service and in particular all those important and highly paid advisers to our government ministers, could he 
reduce the wage bill at all? While making no difference whatsoever to the service they provide?
In fact, if O'Leary himself took over the role of adviser to the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and all other cabinet ministers, he 
could probably reduce unnecessary government expenditure by millions in one fell swoop.
Or we could go one step further and sell the entire government to Ryanair -- or at least the parts of it that we still 
actually control. O'Leary could change the name of the country to RyanEire and we still probably wouldn't notice 
any difference.
If we've lost our sovereignty anyway, it might be better to have the country in the hands of a shrewd entrepreneur. 
What a choice: Michael O'Leary and Ryanair or a Fine Gael/Labour coalition following Fianna Fáil policy and the 
orders of the EU/ECB/IMF troika?

"How could we do without sugar and rum", asked the 18th century poet William Cowper. The very same question 
must have occurred to Campari , which agreed to buy the spirits business of Jamaican rum maker Lascelles 
DeMercado for as much as $415m. The Italian group is trying to offset stagnant sales at home.
I'll have a veggie burger, fries and a spiritual pilgrimage to go. McDonald's said it would open its first vegetarian 
outlets near two of India's most sacred sites: Armistar, home to the Golden Temple, and Katra, near the shrine of 
Vaishno Devi. Both areas are strictly veggie, as pilgrims believe meat eating arouses inappropriate passions.
"You can do anything, but lay off of my red soled shoes". That was the message from Christian Louboutin, who 
won the right to trademark protection for his distinctive red soles in a US federal appeals court. The victory was the 
latest chapter in a legal battle with rival Yves Saint Laurent , which sells similar shoes.
Ryanair  chief Michael O'Leary said the airline would take part in a bid for Stansted, even though it would probably 
overpay, a concept with which his customers - who are charged EUR60 if they forget to print their boarding passes - 
are more than familiar. He said he would push for a new runway at the airport.

Lufthansa flights cancelled as strike escalates

Lufthansa cabin crew will step up their strike action today, causing the cancellation of two-thirds of its flights and 
threatening the German airline with further costly disruption.
The Independent Flight Attendants' Organisation (UFO)   had urged cabin crew to strike for 24 hours from midnight 
yesterday at Lufthansa bases across Germany. The third day of industrial action comes as neither Lufthansa nor 
the union shows signs of backing down in their dispute over pay and working conditions.
The airline took out newspaper advertisements yesterday warning customers of the "massive impact" on its 
schedule after saying that it would cancel more than 1,000 flights.
Christoph Franz, chief executive, and other board members apologised for the disruption, saying that they viewed 
the strike as "disproportionate".
In a letter he said "[the strike] inflicts a high financial cost on the company and harms the reputation of the 
Lufthansa brand," and urged the union to return to the negotiating table.
The union said in a statement that it regretted the escalation "but the negotiations have come to a point where there 
is no alternative to a strike".
Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline by revenues, plans to eliminate 3,500 posts as it aims to reduce costs by at least 
EUR1.5bn through restructuring.
High fuel costs have added to years of fierce competition from no-frills European rivals such as Ryanair as well as 
premium Middle East carriers.
The strike action follows 13 months of inconclusive talks over pay and comes amid union fears about the 
outsourcing of jobs to low-cost airlines and greater use of temporary staff.
Lufthansa flights cancelled as strike escalates
The first stoppages began last Friday at Frankfurt airport, then spread to Berlin and Munich on Tuesday, forcing 
about 350 cancellations, mainly of short and medium-haul flights.
Today's strike action is set to affect the whole of Lufthansa's network of German airports and extend to long-haul 
destinations such as Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro and Hong Kong.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analysts at HSBC, told clients that the escalation would probably prompt the company "to 
investigate legal options, looking to challenge the proportionality of the response to the scale of the disagreement 
between the parties. Alternatively the escalation could force moves towards an arbitrated solution".
Peter Oppitzhauser at Cheuvreux estimated that the three days of strike action would cost Lufthansa up to 
EUR29m, or about 5 per cent of the EUR533m consensus forecast for its 2012 operating profit. However, he 
added: "Labour costs are basically the only cost lever that Lufthansa is able to pull so I expect the airline will 
continue to hold the line unless costs from the strike rise significantly."
Lufthansa made a EUR20m operating loss in the first half of the year, although the second quarter was profitable.

EasyJet rolls out seating plan to all its fleet
EasyJet rolls out seating plan to all its fleet

EasyJet has decided to expand its summer experiment in allocated seating to the entire fleet from November, after 
determining that assigning passengers places did not add to costs but brought in more revenues than the old 
"speedy boarding" option.
The budget carrier started assigning seats on six routes in April , charging passengers who wanted to choose 
where they sat between £3 and £12. It later expanded the trial, eventually covering about 5 per cent of the carrier's 
network, always with a full roll-out in mind.
The risks of reversing what had become standard practice among low-cost carriers included slowing down 
turnround times, which can hurt margins if an aircraft is, therefore, making fewer flights in a day. But easyJet said 
yesterday that there had been no impact on either those times or, more generally, punctuality.
It also found that the money raised from passengers paying for seats matched or exceeded that raised by the £9-
£16 speedy boarding option, which gives the people with those tickets first access to the aircraft.
Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst with HSBC, saw the move as positive, not just because it could boost the top line 
without hurting margins, but also because "it places more space between the easyJet and Ryanair business 
propositions, which is no bad thing".
He estimated it could appeal to families who want to sit together and business travellers irritated by the queueing 
that often goes hand in hand with open seating. EasyJet has been keen to attract business travellers, who tend to 
book closer to their journey times, when tickets are more expensive.
The aspirations are not entirely uncontroversial: Sir Stelios Haji-Ionnau, easyJet's founder and still its biggest 
shareholder, this winter questioned whether business travellers really paid higher fares.
EasyJet rolls out seating plan to all its fleet
But judging from easyJet's research, the new policy should prove popular, given that passengers cited boarding as 
the least pleasant part of an easyJet journey.
While Ryanair reserves exit and front-row seats - which have extra leg-room - to customers willing to pay more, it 
has said it has no plans to follow easyJet's path on aircraft-wide allocated seating.
However other low-cost airlines such as Spain's Vueling and JetBlue in the US have already adopted that model.
Legacy airlines, meanwhile, are copying some of the budget carriers' practices , with increasing numbers offering 
goods and services such as extra legroom a la carte .
Yesterday, Carolyn McCall, chief executive of easyJet, said: "This is an example of easyJet trying to do all it can to 
make travel easy and affordable for our passengers."

As the businessman Lord Hanson once remarked when asked a thorny question about asset pricing and 
accounting niceties: "If you're trading a horse, it is the value to the buyer and what the seller can get for it." The 
same might be said about UK airports.
Ryanair having publicly signalled that it would be a willing minority investor in Stansted airport - which BAA is being 
forced to sell by regulators - is making a valiant effort to talk down the price. It takes issue with use of the Civil 
Aviation Authority's "regulatory asset base" calculation, which threw up a £1.3bn figure earlier this year for 
Stansted, as a lazy proxy for the airport's value. Quite right, too. The RAB is not meant to be a sale valuation 
measure: rather, it reflects the historical cost of assets used in the business, indexed upwards for inflation. Any 
buyer is going to be every bit as interested in the property's earnings potential. And on that score, Ryanair points to 
the 27 per cent fall in passenger numbers passing through Stansted over the past five years. The decline reflects 
tighter holiday budgets, but also the decision of some carriers, including Ryanair, to grow business elsewhere.
Whether Ryanair will find partners that share its vision of restoring growth through airline-friendly, streamlined 
management of Stansted's facilities is less clear, although some travellers, at least, might wish it well. But 
institutional appetite for airport assets is far from sated and Edinburgh sold for more than £800m in April. That 
equated to an enterprise value of almost 17 times 2011 earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation), according to the seller. Citibank reckons that similar multiples for other recent airport trade sales have 
been in the 12.5-17 times range. Stansted's ebitda last year was £87m. Seller and potential buyers ought to start 
there.

Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, would push for a second runway at Stansted "as soon as possible" if 
the budget carrier were to take a stake in London's third biggest airport .
Mr O'Leary has been talking to a number of groups about joining a bid for the facility, which operator BAA - owned 
by Spanish infrastructure company Ferrovial - is being forced by UK competition authorities to sell .
But he emphasised yesterday that Ryanair was interested in a long-term investment, in contrast to some of the 
private equity groups circling Stansted, which might be more reluctant to build a new runway despite planning 
permission having already been granted.
"Most of the potential bidders just want to make as much money as they can in the short term and then flip it on," he 
said. "We have a different vision . . . of a longer-term strategy of significantly lowering the costs of the airport, 
significantly lowering prices and then really driving traffic growth."
He added: "The more capacity at Stansted, the sooner it can grow."
Any consortium that included Ryanair would need to persuade the Civil Aviation Authority that the airline's holding 
did not represent a significant conflict of interest. For that reason Mr O'Leary said he would keep his stake below 25 
per cent. But some industry experts think he could still run foul of regulators.
Mr O'Leary argued that expansion of Stansted was the best first step in a solution to the capital's airport capacity 
crunch . "The logical way to roll out the capacity is at the London airports . . . but aviation needs a national policy, 
and a national policy needs a government with a bit of backbone." He said the government should approve a 
second runway at Stansted, followed by a third runway at Heathrow, then by a second runway at Gatwick.
Ryanair eyes possibilities for Stansted
Mr O'Leary said he expected the Stansted contest to be decided by the end of the year. Regulators have assessed 
the value of the airport's facilities at £1.3bn, but most analysts expect the company to sell for significantly less than 
that.
Mr O'Leary predicted that it would go for "more than it's worth", but said that would not deter him from taking part in 
a bid.

RYANAIR chief executive Michael O'Leary believes he can make a deal with competition authorities to clear the 
way for his takeover of rival airline Aer Lingus.
O'Leary told reporters yesterday: "We are confident that the remedies package will be enough to satisfy competition 
issues.
"There are 46 cross over routes and we will remedy all of them by getting airlines to come to Dublin and take them 
over," O''Leary added.
A route sale would be a step towards appeasing the European Commission, which last week launched an in-depth 
antitrust review into the takeover bid.

BA expands Dublin-London service

Body
British Airways, one of the airlines central to Ryanair's plan to take over Aer Lingus, has said it is looking to expand 
its services between Dublin and London.
BA recently doubled the number of flights between Dublin and London Heathrow, but the airline's Irish manager, 
Simon Daly, said that it was looking at ways in which it could expand the service if it hit its occupancy targets.
While refusing to be drawn on any potential deal with Ryanair, Daly said that the airline had a base in Heathrow and 
would always look at ways of developing its operations at the London airport.
Daly said the decision to double the number of flights, from four to eight, between Dublin and London each day was 
a sign of confidence in the route.
BA doubled the flights in August after following the acquisition of bmi by BA's parent, International Airlines Group 
(IAG).
Daly said they were expecting 600,000 passengers to travel with the airline between Dublin and London each year.
BA is one of a number of airlines central to Michael O'Leary's plan for Aer Lingus. Ryanair has told the European 
Commission that it is willing to give up key routes to ease competition concerns, and is now lining up other airlines 
to take them over.
Already, Ryanair has targeted BA and Virgin Atlantic, with reports stating that it has also contacted France-KLM, 
easyJet, Etihad and Flybe. BA and Virgin Atlantic are reported to be keen to take some of Aer Lingus's valuable 
Heathrow landing slots.
Such deals are crucial if O'Leary is to convince the commission that the deal would not restrict competition. Last 
week, the commission opened an in-depth phase two review of Ryanair's EUR 1.30-a-share offer for Aer Lingus.
BA expands Dublin-London service
In a statement, the commission said its preliminary investigation into the proposed takeover indicated "potential 
competition concerns", given that Ryanair and Aer Lingus were the main operators out of Dublin Airport.
As a result of the commission's decision, Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus lapses under Takeover Panel rules.
However, the airline said that it intended to make another bid for Aer Lingus if the commission cleared its offer. In a 
briefing note, Merrion Stockbrokers said that "the evidence suggests that approval will be difficult to achieve, but it 
is probably unwise to underestimate Michael O'Leary, especially if he can get some major airlines like BA and 
Virgin to cooperate".

Highlight: Export credit agency (ECA) debt has never been more popular, writes Dickon Harris, but banks are 
changing the way they approach ECA-backed financing.
Body
Faced with liquidity constraints, carriers and lessors have been forced to seek alternative financing structures. 
Export credit agencies (ECAs), as was widely expected, have helped fill this gap.? Last year US Ex-Im underwrote 
a record $11.6 billion-worth of aviation debt for its 2011 fiscal year. Early indicators from Airfinance Journal&s Deals 
Database show that the North American ECA is on course for another bumper year and should surpass its 2011 
record by some margin.
Move to debt capital markets?
This year has seen an explosion of ECA-backed bond issues. To date US Ex-Im has underwritten more than $5 
billion-worth of bond issues since 2009. The vast bulk of these deals were signed in 2010, with just three bond 
deals being done in 2011 & for Ethiad, Ryanair and Air China. According to the Deals Database, US Ex-Im has 
backed 11 bond deals that have closed since January 2012 and has at least three bond issues scheduled to close 
within the next six weeks. Carriers have been attracted to the low interest rates, and investors have considerable 
appetite for what is essentially US government debt.
Coupon rates on the latest series of US Ex-Im bonds have steadily dropped below 2% since April. One of the most 
recent issuances by Atlas Air, arranged by BN Paribas and KGS Alpha, secured a coupon rate of just 1.734%. 
Small wonder then that carriers are tempted by the cheap ECA bond options. Many banks like these deals because 
of the higher fees associated with debt capital market transactions. Other banks, especially European banks without 
US dollar deposits, prefer these deals because it allows them to get low-yielding 12-year ECA debt off their books. 
BNP Paribas, one of the most active ECA arranging banks, has stated it will now only fund ECA bond issues.
Race to prefund?
One of the biggest changes this year has been the advent of the prefunded ECA-backed bond. Latam Airlines was 
the first carrier to have signed two of these deals backed by US Ex-Im. This included a JP Morgan-arranged $299.2 
million 12-year bond on July 11 for Latam&s Chilean operations (Lan). The bond had a coupon rate of 1.9% and 
helped refinance delivered aircraft, as well as prefund two 767s. This was soon followed by a separate $287 million 
bond for the carrier&s Brazilian arm (Tam) that solely prefunds two 777-300ERs arranged by Cr&dit Agricole CIB 
and Goldman Sachs that had a coupon rate of 1.829%. Expect to see prefunded bonds for Ryanair, Latam and 
Ethiopian Airlines in the next few months.
Analysis: Riding the ECA rush?
Other ECAs look likely to follow suit. ?UK Export Finance has been keen to underwrite a prefunded deal for many 
months, and there have been rumours that it might cover a prefunded bond issue for Malaysia Airlines. However, a 
financier close to the deal says the delivery deadline is looming, and with little time to prepare a prefunded bond it is 
more likely that the ECA will guarantee a bond refinancing instead. Bankers state that Coface, the French ECA, is 
also looking to do its own prefunded bond.
Enjoy while it lasts??
ECAs have the capability, even with record levels of demand, to do more of these deals. US Ex-Im scored a 
success in May when the US government increased its eventual portfolio cap from $100 billion to $140 billion. US 
Ex-Im has been active guaranteeing its first non-aviation bond for Pemex, covering a total of $1.2 billion in bond 
issuances for the Mexican oil firm. The move suggests that we may see more non-aviation bonds from the ECA.
There are two things that will slow down the rush of these ECA-backed capital issuances. The first is a sudden drop 
in appetite by investors. Experienced banking hands warn that the capital markets can also close just as suddenly 
as they open. The second issue is whether the increase in pricing for ECA deals when January&s Aircraft Sector 
Understanding kicks in will put off airlines from using this financing avenue. The likelihood is that there will be a 
drop, but with few other options carriers will be forced to carry on down this route.
ECAs deserve full credit for embracing the opportunity of today&s capital markets. The hope for airline treasury 
teams globally will be that the markets will still be favourable in time for their next delivery schedule. ??

Body
One of the most amusing aspects of Ryanair's opportunistic third attempt to buy Aer Lingus is how Michael O'Leary, 
chief executive of the Irish low-cost carrier, appears to have taken a vow of silence. Since unveiling the takeover 
proposal in June, the self-confessed "loudmouth" has been saying next to nothing about the bid.
That remarkable show of self-restraint seems part of a broader effort to woo the European Commission which, as 
antitrust regulator, is the main obstacle to Ryanair's bid succeeding. Mr O'Leary and the commission have a 
notoriously poor relationship - which predates Brussels' decision to block Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus, made in 
2006.
But even if Ryanair's verbal assaults on the commission have halted temporarily, Brussels should not approve its 
latest bid for Aer Lingus - because there remains a risk that a combined carrier could rip off consumers through 
higher fares (technically, Ryanair's EUR694m offer for Aer Lingus' equity lapsed on Wednesday, because the 
commission has embarked on an in-depth investigation, but the low-cost carrier plans to re-bid).
Indeed, the fact that Mr O'Leary is trying to consummate the deal at all suggests that he is focused on the wrong 
priorities.
There is no doubting his achievements at Ryanair. Since 1994, Mr O'Leary has turned a struggling Irish upstart 
airline into Europe's leading low-cost carrier by revenue and created the sector's fifth-largest company by market 
value. In an industry dogged by poor profitability, Ryanair boasted an operating margin of 15.6 per cent in 2011-12 - 
putting it ahead of most other listed airlines.
The industry's often wafer-thin margins are partly a result of there being far too many airlines. Consolidation in the 
US market has brought relief, with the remaining five large airlines having greater pricing power and therefore the 
ability to (moderately) raise fares.
However, this proposed takeover of Aer Lingus would leave Ryanair in far too strong a position in its home market, 
by combining Ireland's two main airlines. In 2007, the commission identified 35 routes from Dublin, Shannon and 
Ryanair's 'loudmouth' tight-lipped on takeover bid
Cork airports where Ryanair and Aer Lingus had overlapping routes, potentially giving the combined entity a 
monopoly or dominant position. Aer Lingus claims the number of overlapping routes has increased since then.
The odds are therefore stacked against this deal succeeding. However, it is not hard to see why Mr O'Leary is 
having another go. The failure of Ryanair's first two bids for Aer Lingus - the second offer, made in 2008, was 
withdrawn after objections by the Irish government - is the obvious blemish on Mr O'Leary's record.
His latest bid also appears opportunistic in its timing. It was launched just four days after the UK Competition 
Commission announced an investigation into Ryanair's 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus - a probe that could 
culminate in the low-cost carrier being forced to sell its shareholding. Ryanair is now arguing that the UK 
investigation should be halted while Brussels evaluates its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus.
A deal has not been formally opposed by the cash-strapped Irish government, which has a 25 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus - but probably because it is committed to selling its shareholding in the airline under the terms of the 
country's bailout.
Mr O'Leary is certainly seizing on the European Commission's approval in March of the takeover of BMI British 
Midland by International Airlines Group (IAG), parent of British Airways. The transaction enabled the largest 
operator at London's Heathrow airport to own the second largest. This ruling was a notable departure from the 
commission's practice of mainly approving mergers between airlines where two carriers had their principal 
operations in different airports (such as in the Air France/KLM transaction). However, lossmaking BMI would likely 
have collapsed had it not been bought by IAG. Aer Lingus, by contrast, is a profitable airline.
So how might Mr O'Leary's priorities be wrong?
Since 2010, the Ryanair story has switched from one of growth, via expansion of its all-Boeing fleet, to handing 
cash to shareholders. Mr O'Leary wants more growth but has been holding out for a cut-price aircraft order - which 
has been proving difficult, partly because Boeing has been slower than Airbus in finalising a new version of its 
narrow-body jet.
He would do well to focus the energy he has devoted to the pursuit of Aer Lingus on finalising an aircraft order.

Airline aiming to raise up to Y663bn
Government selling out all its shares
Body
Japan Airlines has set a tight pricing range for its initial public offering , in an indication of strong demand among 
investors for the state-backed flag-carrier that tumbled into bankruptcy two years ago.
JAL yesterday said it would offer shares at between Y3,500 and Y3,790, raising up to Y663bn ($8.4bn) in what 
should rank as the world's second-largest IPO this year, after Facebook.
The narrow pricing range - about half the typical spread for the biggest Japanese deals, according to Dealogic - 
suggests that underwriters are confident of persuading investors to back the offer.
Under Kazuo Inamori, the founder of electronic company Kyocera, JAL has restructured its route network, 
rationalised its fleet of aircraft, cut staff, sold non-core assets and strengthened its balance sheet. In July, it entered 
the low-cost carrier market through Jetstar Japan, a joint venture with Qantas and two Japanese partners.
With an operating margin of 12.2 per cent in the year to March, it ranks as the most profitable flag-carrier in the 
world, according to Bloomberg data.
"It has been a significant turnround in the business," said Nicholas Cunningham, an analyst at Macquarie Securities 
in Tokyo.
At the top end of its indicative pricing range JAL would surpass All Nippon Airways as Japan's biggest carrier by 
market value, and would rank as the fourth-largest worldwide, behind Latam Airlines Group, Singapore Airlines and 
Air China. At the lower end it would rank fifth, ahead of Ryanair, Delta and Cathay Pacific.
JAL sets narrow IPO price range
Either way, the Japanese government can be confident of making a significant return on the Y350bn it injected into 
JAL in early 2010. All 175m shares are being sold by JAL's parent, the state-owned Enterprise Turnaround Initiative 
Corp.
At the midpoint of the range, the offer values JAL at just over five times forecast earnings in the year to March 2013. 
However, under existing laws JAL will likely pay no corporate tax until 2019, thanks to credits earned against 
writedowns. If investors were to apply a standard corporate tax rate to those earnings, JAL's forward p/e moves to 
about eight times, a slight discount to the global aviation sector.
Japan's equity market has been lacklustre in terms of new issuance, with a total of $1.7bn raised so far this year. 
That compares with $15bn in Shanghai, $5.5bn in Hong Kong and $2.1bn in Singapore.
Underwriters led by Daiwa Securities aim to sell about three-quarters of the shares to Japanese investors. The vast 
majority of those will go to retail investors, according to a person familiar with the plans.
A one-week bookbuilding process begins tomorrow. The final price is due to be set on September 10, with trading 
set to start on September 19.

Body
The European Commission yesterday announced an in-depth investigation into Ryanair's third proposed takeover 
of Aer Lingus, after an initial inquiry concluded the transaction could harm competition.
Acting as antitrust regulator, the commission in 2007 prohibited Ryanair's first bid for Aer Lingus amid competition 
concerns. Lawyers said the low-cost carrier's latest offer would probably struggle to gain approval in Brussels.
"The commission's preliminary investigation into the proposed takeover . . . indicated potential competition 
concerns," said the regulator. "On a large number of European routes, mainly out of Ireland, the two airlines are 
each other's closest competitors and barriers to entry appear to be high."
Dublin-based Ryanair in June made an offer of EUR1.30 per Aer Lingus share, valuing the Irish flag carrier's equity 
at EUR694m. Under takeover rules, the offer lapsed yesterday because of the commission's investigation, which 
will run into the new year.
But Ryanair said it "intends to re-bid for Aer Lingus if the European Commission clears its offer following its [in-
depth investigation]".
Aer Lingus, which opposes the bid , said the number of routes out of Ireland where it overlaps with Ryanair had 
increased from 35 in 2007 to 50 today. It added: "The reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger than 
before."
The Aer Lingus board had previously told investors that Ryanair's offer undervalued the company . Ryanair's 
chances of succeeding hinge mainly on whether it can secure regulatory approval rather than shareholder support.
In 2007, the commission concluded that Ryanair's offer to relinquish take-off and landing slots at Dublin airport was 
an inadequate remedy to ensure competition because rival airlines were unlikely to step in.
EU to probe Ryanair 's tilt at Aer Lingus
Ryanair has approached at least six airlines - Air France-KLM, easyJet, Etihad Airways, Flybe, International Airlines 
Group and Virgin Atlantic - asking them to consider providing services on some of the routes it operates jointly with 
Aer Lingus. However, several of these six airlines have limited or no interest in providing services out of Ireland.
Commission officials said they would consider any remedy proposals from Ryanair, but stressed that the low-cost 
carrier had done little to prove that a merger with Aer Lingus would not hurt competition.
Bruce Kilpatrick, competition lawyer at Addleshaw Goddard, said: "Unless Ryanair can show that market conditions 
have changed in its favour - and it is far from clear that they have - then it is likely to face an uphill struggle."

Body
Michael O'Leary, boss of Ryanair, has built up an airline that operates with commendable efficiency. The same 
cannot be said for his acquisition strategy. The latest round in Ryanair's five-year pursuit of Aer Lingus looks 
increasingly like a waste of time and effort for both bidder and target.
Yesterday, EU competition officials opened an in-depth inquiry into the low-cost carrier's June bid for its Irish rival. 
But their accompanying words made the EUR700m offer's chances of overcoming antitrust obstacles appear ever 
more slender. On a "large number of European routes, mainly out of Ireland", the two carriers are each other's 
closest - and often only - competitors, they noted. Barriers to entry "appear to be high". And since 2007, when 
Brussels first rebuffed the proposed Irish tie-up, the number of routes that both carriers operate has increased, they 
also observed. Aer Lingus puts the figure at about 50.
Of course, it is possible that Mr O'Leary may yet cobble together a clutch of rival carriers willing to take on large 
parts of Aer Lingus's route network. But lobbing in an offer and then scouring for solutions to endemic monopoly 
problems is hardly the best modus operandi - and his efforts do not appear to be making much progress. Those 
who always suspected Ryanair's offer was a ploy to trump a UK inquiry into whether it should have to dispose of its 
29.9 per cent Aer Lingus stake seem increasingly justified.
On purely financial grounds, investors in Ryanair may not care too much: the carrier's Aer Lingus stake, which cost 
EUR407m, has already been written down to about EUR80m. But the bid antics will mean months of legal fees and 
management distraction for both carriers. That might be indulged in boom times. In an age of austerity, it is an 
extravagance that needs to end.

Loss-making Italian airline Meridiana-Air Italy accused low-cost giant Ryanair on Wednesday of "unfair

The Italian airline, borne out of the recent merger of two local carriers, said it will stop the Verona-Bari and Milan

Small airports in Italy gave funds to Ryanair for it to develop international routes, Meridiana-Air Italy said. But 
instead, the Irish carrier is using the money to subsidise flights within Italy, directly competing with local carriers, 
Meridiana-Air Italy said.
"Meridiana-Air Italy will verify the competitive conditions in each single airport. Should it find distortions, it will 
immediately axe the connection," the group said in a statement. Meridiana-Air Italy reported on Wednesday a first-
half net loss of 60.9 million euros, compared with a pro-forma loss of 67.3 million euros a year earlier, when the two 
groups had not yet merged. Ryanair was not immediately available for comment. ( C) Reuters

THE EUROPEAN Commission has put the brakes on Ryanair's latest takeover bid for Aer Lingus by opening an in-
depth competition probe.
The investigation means Ryanair's (EURO)694m (£549.5m) offer for its Irish rival lapses, though the airline said it 
plans to make a new bid for Aer Lingus if it gets clearance from Brussels.
The Commission, which now has until 14 January to investigate the offer, said yesterday it has concerns that on 
Irish routes, the "barriers to entry appear to be high. Many of these routes are currently only served by the two 
airlines".
It added that the overlap between the two firms' operations has increased since 2007, when the European 
authorities blocked a previous bid by Ryanair.
But Ryanair has argued that the aviation industry has changed dramatically since its earlier bids, as shown by 
Europe's green light for IAG's acquisition of BMI earlier this year.
A UK Competition Commission probe into Ryanair's existing 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus is ongoing.

The European Commission decided Wednesday to launch an in-depth investigation into whether Irish airline 
Ryanair's proposed takeover of rival Aer Lingus would hinder competition, a spokesman said.
The Commission must decide by Jan. 14 whether or not to block the proposed deal, said Simon O'Connor, a 
spokesman for the Commission, which is the executive branch of the European Union.
"The Commission's preliminary investigation into the proposed takeover indicated potential competition concerns," 
O'Connor said.
He noted that Ryan Air and Aer Lingus are the main airlines operating out of Dublin, and there are many routes 
between Dublin and other European cities that are served only by those two airlines.
However, he said the Commission's decision to begin a full investigation did not prejudge its conclusions.
Ryanair, the low-cost Irish airline, has made a bid for Aer Lingus valuing the airline at about (EURO)700 million 
($878.36 million). Aer Lingus has written to shareholders urging them to reject the bid.
Ryanair issued a statement Wednesday saying only that its offer lapsed following the Commission's decision, in 
accordance with takeover rules. But it said it intended to re-bid for Aer Lingus if the Commission cleared the way for 
the merger.
Aer Lingus issued a statement supporting the Commission's decision, noting that Ryanair's first attempt to take over 
Aer Lingus was prohibited in 2007 on competition grounds. Ryanair abandoned its second bid in 2008 after too few 
shareholders took up the offer.
"Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's 
only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes," the Aer Lingus statement said. "The number of 
routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007. The 
reasons for prohibition are therefore even stronger than before."
EU probes Ryanair's bid to take over Aer Lingus
In June, Ryanair offered (EURO)1.30 ($1.65) per share for its main Irish rival, its third bid since Aer Lingus' 2006 
flotation. Ryanair is already Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake, the government second 
with 25 percent.
Air Lingus says that even Ryanair's minority shareholding is "contrary to the interests of consumers and the majority 
of our shareholders."
Aer Lingus has struggled in recent years to slash costs sufficiently to compete with Ryanair, which is Europe's 
fastest-growing airline. It has suffered regular battles with labor unions, whereas Ryanair doesn't recognize them. 
But it did post a modest profit last year and has been expanding its own European short-haul network.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary argues that the government must sell Aer Lingus because it needs the 
cash, and would be far better off selling to another Irish company. The other potential suitor, Etihad Airways of the 
United Arab Emirates, this year bought a 3 percent stake in Aer Lingus and has expressed interest in the 
government holding.

Ryanair Holdings (Nasdaq: RYAAY), Europe's largest discount airline, is asking rivals to compete against it in the 
hopes that increased competition might assuage European Union regulators who are deepening their investigation 
of Ryanair's proposed buyout of Aer Lingus Group PLC (LON:AERL).
 Ryanair has asked six other airlines to fly alternative routes connected to Dublin, a market that it dominates along 
with Aer Lingus, to assure regulators that the market will remain competitive, the Financial Times reported. Ryanair 
approached Air France-KLM (Paris: AF), easyJet plc (London: EZJ), Flybe Group Ltd. (London FLYB), International 
Consolidated Airlines Group SA (PINK: ICAGY), Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. and Etihad Airways PJSC to open 
flights.
 But with no firm commitments from Ryanair's competitors to fly those alternative routes, the European Commission 
said Wednesday that it will still intensify its probe of the contemplated deal on anti-trust concerns.
  On a large number of European routes, mainly out of Ireland, the two airlines are each other s closest competitors 
and barriers to entry appear to be high,  the commission said in a statement.  Many of these routes are currently 
only served by the two airlines. The takeover could therefore lead to the elimination of actual and potential 
competition on a large number of these routes. 
 Ryanair, which already owns 29.82 percent of Aer Lingus, offered 694 million euros ($874 million) for the remaining 
part of the company in June, around a 38 percent premium based on Aer Lingus' share price at the time, according 
to the New York Times. The Irish government owns 25 percent of Aer Lingus, but has said it is looking to sell as it 
recovers from the financial crisis.
 The commission will decide whether to block the deal by Jan. 14, 2013. It is also investigating the impact of 
Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. The commission previously rejected Ryanair's first takeover attempt of Aer 
Lingus in June 2007, and another bid was withdrawn in 2009.
 Aer Lingus has opposed the deal, noting that a combined airline would have a monopoly in three major airports 
and 90 percent of flights between London and Dublin.
 "Aer Lingus is a much stronger airline today than it was at the time of the previous Ryanair offers and is Ryanair's 
only significant competitor on the vast majority of Irish air routes," the company said in a statement. "The number of 
routes into and out of Ireland on which Aer Lingus and Ryanair compete has sharply increased since 2007."
 Ryanair carried 75.8 million passengers in the year ending March 2012 and Aer Lingus carried 10.4 million 
passengers in 2011, according to the European Commission.
 Shares of Ryanair fell 26 cents to $30.83 in Wednesday morning trading, while shares of Aer Lingus were flat at 
1.08 euros at London's Wednesday close.

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd. has cancelled 34 weekly flights to/from Morocco because Office National Des Aeroports, or 
ONDA, the Moroccan government's airports authority, has reneged on its agreement with the airline by imposing a 
new monopoly handling company on Ryanair which would have resulted in a massive increase in charges for the 
airline.
Body
ONDA has refused to guarantee Ryanair the continuation of the cost levels of its original agreement. Consequently, 
Ryanair has announced substantial reductions to its flight program to Moroccan airports which will include 
reductions of eight weekly frequencies at Nador, six at Fez, eight at Marrakesh, four at Tangier and the complete 
closure of its operation at Oujda Airport (eight weekly frequencies). The changes will be effective from October 1, 
2012. Ryanair's Deputy CEO, Michael Cawley said: "Ryanair entered into long term agreements with the Moroccan 
Tourism Authority and ONDA, as part of the Moroccan Govt's 5 year plan to grow tourism. 
Ryanair has spectacularly over-delivered on all its undertakings under these agreements, becoming Morocco's 
second largest airline and ensuring the Moroccan Govt achieved its 5 year targets within an earlier timescale. It is 
regrettable that ONDA has now lost sight of the key to the success of our partnership, offering low fares based on 
low costs. Ryanair cannot accept cost increases as it seeks to deliver more growth to Morocco. It is completely 
unacceptable for ONDA to increase the cost of Ryanair's operation in Morocco and unrealistic for them to expect us 
to continue to grow our business in that context." Mr Cawley added: "Consequently I regret to announce that we are 
making these substantial reductions which will result in up to 100,000 less tourists annually and an annual loss in 
tourism expenditure and job losses for the Moroccan economy of E50 million. Ryanair will now allocate this capacity 
elsewhere to the many markets earnestly seeking Ryanair's growth and that are offering long term, sustainable cost 
bases to underpin Ryanair's guaranteed low fares."

(RTTNews) - Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said that it intends to re-bid for Aer Lingus Group 
plc (AERL.L) if the European Commission clears its offer following its Phase II review.
The company said that the making of any such Further Offer will require consent of the Takeover Panel to a 
derogation from the prohibition on making a further offer within twelve months after the date on which the original 
Offer lapsed.
Ryanair noted that following today's decision of the European Commission to refer the acquisition of Aer Lingus to 
Phase II, Ryanair's Offer lapses, with immediate effect, and all acceptances of the Offer to date are void.
In June 2012, Ryanair had said that it plans to make an all-cash offer of 1.30 euros per share for rival Aer Lingus 
Group, valuing that company at about 694 million euros or $879 million. It was the airline's third bid for Aer Lingus 
as part of its efforts to create a single Irish airline group.
Ryanair had first tried to acquire Aer Lingus in late 2006, but that bid was blocked by the European Commission on 
antitrust grounds.

Ryanair is seeking regulatory approval for its proposed take-over of Aer Lingus by asking at least six airlines to 
operate competing services on some of the Irish flag carrier's routes.
Ryanair has approached Air France-KLM, easyJet, Etihad   , Flybe, InternationalAirlines Group and Virgin Atlantic, 
asking them to consider providing competition on routes to and from Dublin where the two Irish carriers are the 
leading or only providers. However, in a sign that Ryanair could find it difficult to secure regulatory approval 
because its proposed Aer Lingus takeover risks a substantial reduction in competition, some of these six airlines 
have expressed limited or no interest in operating services to Ireland.
Ryanair, Europe's leading low-cost carrier, declined to comment, as did the six airlines it has approached.
The European Commission is tomorrow expected to launch an in-depth investigation into what is Ryanair's third 
offer for Aer Lingus, five years after prohibiting its first bid.
Brussels raised concerns in 2007 at how, following a Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus, the combined entity would 
have a monopoly or dominant position on 35 routes out of Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports that went to European 
destinations ranging from Alicante to -Warsaw.
It concluded that Ryanair's offer to relinquish airport take-off and landing slots, to facilitate competition on these 35 
routes, was inadequate because no rival airlines appeared likely to operate alternative services.
Ryanair, which has a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, is seeking to avoid a repetition of the commission's 2007 
objections by demonstrating that other airlines would operate routes where the two Irish carriers have overlapping 
services.
British Airways, the UK subsidiary of IAG, and Virgin Atlantic were interested in using Aer Lingus slots at London's 
Heathrow airport to provide services to Dublin, said people familiar with the situation. But these people said BA and 
Virgin were not interested in running services from Ireland to other Europe destinations.
Ryanair invites rivals to help in takeover fight
Ryanair in June offered EUR1.30 per Aer Lingus share, valuing the carrier's equity at EUR694m.
One top 20 Aer Lingus shareholder said: "We would like to see more money on the table from Ryanair before we 
give the deal our blessing."

It has previosuly been reported that Ryanair had made informal approaches to airlines, including BA and Virgin

competition concerns.
The European Commission is tomorrow expected to launch an in-depth investigation into what is Ryanair's third

three months. Brussels raised concerns in 2007 at how, following a Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus, the combined

Twitter, Facebook, viral videos . . . new ways of spreading the word are becoming more important to luxury brands, 
but the traditional print and poster campaign is still a critical vehicle for conveyinga label's core message for the 
new season. "You don't need to compare classic ad campaigns with social media but instead discover how they 
can work effectively together to create the best brand message," says Emma Hill, creative director at Mulberry.
Michael Kors remarks: "Methods of print advertising are still very important today, but we also share our ad images 
in outdoor settings, as well as on digital, mobile and social media platforms." Since campaigns are seen by more 
people than ever, the pressure is on to make them powerful. But which brands are succeeding?
1. Moncler
Disregarding the advice that you should never work with animals, this Moncler model has bravely posed with a 
couple of polar bears - or at least models in furry costumes. It's cute, but what is it saying? Hang loose in Moncler's 
feather down jackets without getting frostbite? Switch off that ice-cap-melting central heating and reach for a puffer 
jacket? Remo Ruffini, chairman and creative director of Moncler, explains: "The latest campaign supports the non-
profit organisation Green Chimneys, a leader in animal-assisted therapy for kids that also provides care for animals 
and nature." Practical, philanthropic puffers - that's the message.
2. Louis Vuitton
Given Louis Vuitton's core as a luggage company, this vision of luxury travel, shot by Steven Meisel, is as on-brand 
as it gets. An appealing message: buy a Vuitton bag and step back to a pre-Ryanair golden age of travel. Don't tell 
me those models have decanted all the liquids inside their "it" hand luggage into clear plastic bags for security. It 
certainly hasn't been done on the cheap - the train was specially built for the Paris catwalk show in March, then 
replicated in a New York studio - but they can probably afford it. In July, the Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy group 
reported a 28 per cent jump in net income to EUR1.7bn for the first half of 2012.
Power to the picture
3. Alexander McQueen
Shot by David Sims, the McQueen campaign has been designed to showcase the artistry and imagination of the 
label's dresses, its unique selling point. The ads run over a spread with a black-and-white close-up of a dress on 
one side and a full-length in colour on the other. The sharp origami shape on which the model stands, combined 
with her minimal make-up and bleached-out hair, highlight the extravagant and organic fantasy of the dresses. One 
resembles a rose made of pink mille feuille silk, the other a feathery puffball. You would never guess that the 
collection was inspired by mushrooms.
4. Pucci
Given the amount of whimsy and nostalgia around this season, it's good to see a sultry ad from Pucci. For the 
brand's first ever campaign they've summed up the house's DNA (prints, sex, heritage, Italy) with a patterned-silk 
clad Amber Valletta sprawled on a couch and a hint of noir via moody lighting. Subtle? No. Seductive? Yes.
5. Mulberry Fashion is fun. That's the message behind Mulberry's campaigns. The monsters that inspired the 
catwalk show appear in this season's campaign, which depicts the doll-like model Lindsey Wixson in a fairytale 
forest clutching Mulberry's latest arm candy, and surrounded by giant furry creatures. They seem friendly, but for 
how long, since Wixon is wearing a series of shaggy coats that look like monster fur? Emma Hill says the ad "plays 
on the romance and darkness of children's fairytales, with mysterious creatures and the idea of travel, fantasy and 
beauty. The icing on the cake is Tim Walker shooting the campaign; he creates a strong, rich narrative and the right 
mix of charm, romance and darkness." It's playful on the surface, while stirring subconscious fears, memories and 
desires - not least the urge to rush out and buy a new handbag.
6. Lanvin
"It's all about individuals with individuality," Alber Elbaz has said of the new Lanvin fashion campaign, which uses 
"real" people or, as the rest of the "real" world knows them, people who aren't models. It's a smart approach: not 
only are street-style blogs attracting as much interest as the catwalk, but when globalisation threatens uniqueness, 
a sense of character is appealing. Lanvin's image is of a brand that caters to women of different ages and sizes (ie 
not just size zero) and these characters - aged 18 to 81 and found through a street casting in New York - capitalise 
on that. A video of the shoot was released this week, in which the hitherto anonymous models reveal quirky 
elements of their personalities.
7. Michael Kors A fur-trimmed wool coat and chunky jumper worn with sunglasses on a bright LA day? This isn't 
Michael Kors' suggestion on how to regulate your body temperature this autumn, but his manifesto for glamour. 
Kors says of the campaign, shot by Mario Testino, that it "fuses together two of my most cherished themes: jetset 
style and Hollywood glamour. The images draw inspiration from the backlots of golden-age Hollywood.
"The contrast of them [models Karmen Pedaru and Simon Nessman] being both youthful and sophisticated, super-
glamorous and approachable, all at the same time is very Michael Kors," says Kors, whose tight brand image 
helped him launch the biggest-ever initial public offering in US fashion last December. This campaign sticks to the 
script as religiously as an eager-to-please starlet.
8. Miu Miu
Fashion's David Bowie moment continues this season, thanks to the Miu Miu campaign. Cross Bowie with a cord-
wearing university lecturer and a garish suburban sofa, all from the 1970s, and you've got the look. It takes a brave 
soul to wear so much clashing print - although indie actress Chloë Sevigny, who also appeared in a Miu Miu 
campaign in 1996, might plausibly do so - but then this ad broadcasts that Miu Miu is all about determinedly offbeat 
dressing and taking risks. There's not much mise-en-scène, just a shag-pile carpet and a modernist chair, because 
this isn't a lifestyle brand like Armani or Michael Kors. Designer Miuccia Prada is about pure fashion for fashion's 
sake.

Aer Lingus this morning reiterated its call for shareholders in the airline to reject Ryanair's takeover offer.
At the end of last month, Aer Lingus urged shareholders to deny Ryanair the chance of controlling the former flag 
carrier, saying that the E694m offer grossly undervalues Aer Lingus.
Today, Aer Lingus said that its board unanimously recommends that shareholders take no action in relation to the 
offer.
It also urged shareholders not to sign any document sent by Ryanair or its advisers. "Aer Lingus is a strong and 
profitable airline with a proven business model; a strong balance sheet; and an internationally recognised and 
valued brand. The Board's unanimous view is that Ryanair's Offer to acquire control of Aer Lingus for E1.30 per 
share fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus and represents a significant discount to the intrinsic value of the 
business," the Aer Lingus board statement said. It added that the offer of E1.30 per share represents a discount of 
34 per cent. to Aer Lingus' gross cash per share of E1.96 (total E1,049.9 million) and that the gross cash on Aer 
Lingus' balance sheet more than pays for Ryanair's Offer. It added that the offer is a discount of 12 per cent. to Aer 
Lingus' Net Asset Value per share of E1.48 based on the NAV shown in the 30 June 2012 balance sheet and that 
this NAV does not attribute any value to either the airline's attractive slot portfolio or brand. "Aer Lingus delivered a 
E130 million turnaround in operating performance between 2009 and 2011. The Group continues to make strategic, 
operating and financial progress. Such progress is reflected in the 2012 first half results released on 31 July 2012. 
On that date, Aer Lingus stated that, if current trading conditions continue, operating profit, before net exceptional 
items, for 2012 will be at least that achieved in 2011 (E49.1 million)".

Highlight: Aer Lingus called on shareholders to resist budget carrier Ryanair's 700 million euro takeover bid as the 
rival Irish airlines dig in for a corporate battle that looks likely to drag into next year.
Body
Aer Lingus called on shareholders to resist budget carrier Ryanair's 700 million euro takeover bid as the rival Irish 
airlines dig in for a corporate battle that looks likely to drag into next year.
Both airlines said they did not expect EU antitrust regulators to approve the 694 million euro (dollar 849 million) 
takeover bid for the former state carrier in a decision due by Wednesday.
Instead they expect it to move to a longer Phase II process that can last up to 105 working days, which would push 
a resolution into next year.
While Ryanair promised to offer the EU "radical remedies" to address competition concerns, Aer Lingus said the bid 
was doomed to fail. "Ryanair's offer is not in the interests of shareholders, fundamentally undervalues the business 
and is likely once more to be prohibited by the European Commission," Aer Lingus said in a statement to 
shareholders published today. "The board re-affirms its recommendation that shareholders should reject the offer," 
it said. Aer Lingus' shares have gained 14 euro cent to 1.08 since Ryanair announced its bid in June, but remain 22 
cents short of the offer price, implying that many traders are yet to be convinced that the bid will be successful. The 
European Commission, which acts as EU competition watchdog, is among the biggest impediments to a deal which 
was announced in June and is Ryanair's third attempt to take over the former state carrier. The EU executive 
blocked Ryanair's 2007 attempted takeover of Aer Lingus, saying the combined group would monopolise or 
dominate 35 routes, leading to consumers paying more. It said Ryanair had not offered to give up enough airport 
slots to allay its concerns. Ryanair, which already owns 30 percent of Aer Lingus, dropped its second offer in 2009. 
In its statement, Aer Lingus said the commission would likely reject the takeover bid, something it can only do after 
a Phase II probe. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary told journalists in Madrid on Thursday he expected the commission 
to move to Phase II but said he would offer unspecified remedies to allay competition concerns. Analysts expect 
him to try to convince rival airlines to commit to compete on the 44 routes where Ryanair and Aer Lingus currently 
Ryanair /AL battle to last in to 2013 AL Ry Battle
have no third-party competition. Ryanair has already held talks with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic about 
possibly opening routes to compete with a combined Irish airline, according to a source with knowledge of the talks. 
Virgin has spoken to both Ryanair and Aer Lingus recently about airport slots, a second source said. Ryanair, Virgin 
and British Airways all declined to comment. But to allay competition concerns, Ryanair will have to go beyond the 
London hubs of British Airways and Virgin, and show there will be sustainable competition on the 50 routes they 
compete on across Europe. "If they could get British Airways or Virgin on board, that would be one tick in the box, 
but they will need much more than that. The trick is proving competition across the network," said Merrion Capital 
analyst Gerard Moore. Moore said Ryanair has a "fighting chance" of securing approval, but said reversing the 
European Commission's decision to reject an earlier bid would be difficult. "It's tough, but not impossible," he said.

(RTTNews) - Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L) on Friday announced that its Board has re-affirmed recommendation

The Board of Aer Lingus Group wrote to shareholders on 31 July, outlining its reasons for recommending 
shareholders reject Ryanair offer to purchase the whole of the issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Aer 
Lingus not already owned by Ryanair. The company said, since the issuance of the circular, no new information has 
been provided by Ryanair in relation to the Offer, and so the Board re-affirmed its recommendation with respect to 
the Offer.

Air passengers face higher fares, fewer flight choices and crowded aircraft as European carriers trim seating 
capacity growth or cut routes altogether, as they battle to salvage profits and fend off the impact of rising fuel prices.
With jet fuel prices near record highs at the same time as taxes and airport charges rise, airlines are curbing the 
growth of capacity - the number of seats they make available - and the frequency of some flights to lower costs and 
not drive away customers already spooked by rising fares.
According to the Association of European Airlines, capacity among its member airlines eased by 4.6 percent in the 
first half of this year compared with the year-earlier period.
But that decline comes after an increase of almost 23 percent between 2004 and 2011, driven by new aircraft 
ordered by airlines when demand was much stronger than it is now. "We have 10 to 20 percent overcapacity in 
Europe, based on the number of seats offered," Philipp Goedeking, managing director and airlines expert at 
consultancy AlixPartners told Reuters. Deutsche Lufthansa for instance added more than 50 percent capacity 
between 2007, the airline industry's last peak, and 2011, according to Reuters data, boosted by the acquisition of 
carriers including Brussels Airlines and Austrian Airlines. The low-cost segment has been growing even faster, with 
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair adding 72 percent more seats and British peer easyJet growing by 59 percent. 
Expansion has slowed dramatically this year, with Lufthansa adding only 2.3 percent capacity in the half of 2012 
and British Airways owner IAG 2.6 percent. Easyjet added 5.9 percent more seats in the first nine months of its 
fiscal year. Some airlines are now retiring older aircraft sooner than planned, delaying delivery of new planes or 
selling some smaller aircraft to shrink their fleet, but none want to be caught out with too little capacity when 
demand picks up again. Australia's struggling flagship carrier Qantas Airways this week cancelled orders for 35 
Boeing Dreamliner jets as part of a plan to cut costs at its loss-making international business. The airline said it 
Passengers see full flights, less choice Air Future
would eliminate loss-making routes and make cuts in jobs and spending, having posted its first annual loss in 17 
years. Most airlines saw profitability - in terms of revenue per seat offered - drop during the global financial crisis as 
demand for air travel fell faster than they could cut capacity. Since then they have regained ground, but there is 
concern a further deterioration of European economies will lead to a repeat. Spanish carrier Iberia's unit revenue, 
for instance, dropped to 5.05 euro cents in 2009 from 6.07 in 2007. IAG, the group created by the merger of Iberia 
and British Airways, had unit revenue of 6.72 euro cents in the first half of 2012. Lufthansa still plans to grow this 
year but has cut its capacity expansion plans to 0.5 percent from 12 percent. Air France-KLM has also scaled down 
capacity growth, having already shrunk 20 percent before the crisis. Many airlines are focusing on axing some of 
their less- profitable routes, especially short-haul services to secondary cities in Europe, hitting travellers who rely 
on regional airports - such as Britons with second homes on the continent. Nicholas Blair, from Leicester in central 
England, bought a holiday home in the Loire region of western France five years ago, partly because Ryanair had 
regular flights to nearby Nantes from his local airport. However, the Irish carrier stopped services to Nantes late last 
year. "It used to take us four hours door to door flying from East Midlands airport, but now we either have to fly to 
Dublin and change flights or go to Limoges, hire a car and drive, which makes it so much more inconvenient and 
much more expensive. One of the reasons we bought the property was because of the convenient and cheap travel 
to it," said Blair. In Britain, regional airports have also had European services cut by airlines because higher airport 
charges that came into force this year have made it unprofitable for budget carriers to offer short flights to 
neighbouring countries. They have also been hit by the UK's air passenger duty (APD) and the winding down of 
low-cost carrier bmibaby after its parent was bought by IAG. It plans to scrap several Bmi routes - including to 
Amritsar in India and Casablanca in Morocco - after the summer, due to "poor revenue performance". EasyJet 
recently announced plans to close its base at Madrid airport next year due to a combination of overcapacity, leading 
to low revenue per passenger, and rising airport charges. Ryanair routinely justifies route changes with the airport 
charges and taxes it pays, but it has shifted capacity in recent months from Spain and increased it in faster-growing 
Poland. "The major driver is the deals they get from airports, but the economic environment and the nature of the 
destinations (if it is a sun or city destination) also plays a role," said Merrion Capital analyst Gerard Moore. Legacy 
carriers like BA make most of their profit on long-haul flights and need to offer domestic and European flights to 
bring passengers to their hubs to fill long-haul seats. "If 70 to 80 percent of an airline's passengers are transferring 
to other flights, you cannot do without feeder flights," AlixPartners' Goedeking said. European airlines, stung by an 
economic crisis sweeping the continent, are also keen to add services to emerging markets in Asia and fast-
growing nations in eastern Europe to tap into growing passenger numbers that can fill up bigger planes. BA recently 
announced new routes from London Heathrow to South Korean capital Seoul and is competing with easyJet to win 
rights for 14 weekly flights from London Gatwick to Moscow, using slots formerly held by Bmi. Data seems to show 
that airlines' efforts are paying off to some extent. The passenger load factor in Europe widened to 82.5 percent on 
international routes in June from 80.6 percent a year earlier, according to industry body IATA. For domestic flights, 
the figure improved to 81.6 percent from 79.8 percent a year earlier, showing airlines are offering fewer seats that 
end up unused. But those figures do not take into account whether airlines are lowering ticket prices to lure more 
customers onto their planes. Data from industry bodies IATA and ICAO show average fares globally increasing 1.4 
percent between 2005 and 2010, during which time the price of oil - a key factor for airlines costs - rose by more 
than 40 percent. Not everyone admits to viewing such trends in a negative light. "I love price competition," Ryanair 
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on a recent conference call. "It ... means the competition blow their brains out 
even faster than would normally be the case." (C ) Reuters

News analysis
Shareholders weigh up move by Sir Brian Souter, write  Andrew Parker  and David Oakley
Body
Britain will be losing one of its most colourful chief executives with Sir Brian Souter's relinquishment of the top 
management role at Stagecoach.
He has combined entrepreneurial flair with outspoken views while running Stagecoach and he may be missed as 
much for his casual dress as his record in creating one of the world's biggest bus and train operators.
But Sir Brian is not leaving Stagecoach - he plans to move from chief executive to chairman in May next year - and 
this is causing nervousness among some investors who fear that he might disrupt his successor.
In an email to staff yesterday, Sir Brian, 58, said: "Now is the right time for me to take a step back from the day-to-
day management of the business.
"Stagecoach is in excellent shape and it has always been my intention to pass the baton well before retirement."
Sir Brian and his sister Ann Gloag co-founded Stagecoach in 1980 with just two buses. Today, it is the UK's largest 
listed bus and train operator by market capitalisation.
The company has achieved its status by riding the wave of deregulation in the bus and rail industries during the 
1980s and 1990s - and it was not afraid to use aggressive tactics against competitors. For example, Stagecoach 
sometimes ran free buses that arrived just ahead of rivals' services.
But above all, Stagecoach has been entrepreneurial. Sir Brian, who paid his way through university by working as a 
bus conductor, considers one of his most significant achievements to be megabus.com - Stagecoach's no-frills, 
lowcost, long-distance bus service that he likens to Ryanair.
Stagecoach aims to oil wheels of succession
This willingness to take risks with new services and acquisitions has mostly led to a solid financial performance - 
certainly in recent years. In the year to April 30, Stagecoach reported pre-tax profit of £239.8m, up 14.4 per cent 
compared to 2010-11.
The one notable blemish in the Stagecoach story was its disastrous acquisition of Coach USA, a sprawling North 
American bus, coach and taxi operator, in 1999.
The challenge of sorting out the American business prompted Sir Brian to take the role of chief executive in 2002 - 
he had been chairman since 1998.
Sir Brian's successor as chief executive will be Martin Griffiths, currently Stagecoach's finance director, who first 
joined the company in 1998 and like Sir Brian is a chartered accountant.
Mr Griffiths faces several challenges, including the turnround of Stagecoach's London bus business and deciding 
how the company should respond to its joint venture with Virgin Group, called Virgin Rail, losing the West Coast 
train franchise .
But could Mr Griffiths' biggest challenge be dealing with Sir Brian? As well as chairman, Sir Brian is the company's 
largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake.
Some other shareholders in Stagecoach were critical of Sir Brian's move to chairman because of worries it could 
undermine the freedom of Mr Griffiths to draw up new plans.
One top 30 investor said: "My main concern is that Sir Brian will still try and run the company, when he should be 
standing back more. That could hinder the new chief executive."
Other shareholders were more relaxed, however, saying Sir Brian was "highly regarded" and would make a good 
chairman.
Although the UK corporate governance code states that a chief executive should not become chairman of the same 
company, these shareholders highlighted that the guidance was not mandatory.
Groups are supposed to explain their reasons for not complying with the code - as Stagecoach has done.
One top 20 investor said: "We are sure Sir Brian will act in the best interests of the company and the shareholders."
A Stagecoach spokesman declined to say whether Sir Brian would have an executive or non-executive role as 
chairman, or specify how much time he would devote to the new job.
Sir Brian said in his email that he would remain "heavily involved" in Stagecoach as chairman but stressed that Mr 
Griffiths had a "strong personality".
"Martin and I have been a team for around a decade and we will continue to work closely together," he added. "I'm 
confident he will be an excellent chief executive."

Shares in Heineken dropped 1.1 per cent to EUR44.00 yesterday, on the back of disappointing first-half figures . 
The stock had gained 1.5 per cent in the previous session.
Earnings before interest and taxes rose 4.3 per cent year on year to EUR1.16bn buoyed by acquisitions and 
currency gains. But in the key western European market, volumes fell 2.9 per cent.
The results come as the Dutch brewer seeks to conclude a tumultuous bidding war for a further share in Asia 
Pacific Breweries , the maker of Tiger beer.
Ryanair added 1 per cent to EUR4.25 after the company said it might bid for a 25 per cent stake in the UK's 
Stansted airport , where the airline is the biggest customer.
Shares in Adecco , the Swiss staffing group, lost 1.8 per cent to SFr44.06. Andrew Brooke, an analyst at RBC 
Capital Markets, chose the stock as a "top pick" cyclical investment: "We believe it can grow earnings per share in 
relatively muted economies, mix is improving, the balance sheet is strong and cost and capital discipline are second 
to none. The dividend payout ratio of 40-50 per cent and the ongoing EUR400m buyback underlines management's 
commitment to shareholders."
Fresenius , the dialysis company, dragged German markets lower. Shares dropped 2.9 per cent to EUR85.40 after 
rumours emerged that the supervisory board was considering a fresh takeover bid from rival Rhoen-Klinikum.
Spanish names littered the list of losers on the FTSE Eurofirst 300. Repsol   , the oil and gas company, fell 5.3 per 
cent to EUR14.45, ACS lost 5.1 per cent to EUR14.94   and power utility Iberdrola dropped 4 per cent to EUR3.20.
Spain's benchmark Ibex 35 index shed 2.7 per cent to 7,340.7.

Industry experts expect Stansted to be the first of several disposals by BAA in the next few years as the company 
that spent decades running an empire of airports considers the merits of focusing solely on Heathrow, writes Rose 
Jacobs  .
The UK's biggest airport by passenger numbers represents more than 90 per cent of BAA's revenues, so losing 
Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton would not change the group's financial profile significantly.
Meanwhile, "with Gatwick and Stansted both sold, it becomes more difficult to see the economic logic of keeping 
the others", said Colin Smith, head of airports at PwC.
That is not to say the airports lack appeal. Aberdeen is the best-performing regional asset in BAA's portfolio due to 
links to the oil and gas industry. But returns could fall off as North Sea oil declines.
Glasgow could benefit from next year's Commonwealth Games but also faces competition from Edinburgh Airport.
Mr Smith says the smaller airports would attract a different breed of investor from those weighing a Stansted bid. 
London's third-biggest hub is drawing interest from banks in search of inflation-pegged returns, from other airports 
and from its biggest customer, Ryanair, which has expressed interest in a 25 per cent stake.
Smaller, unregulated airports offer greater risk and greater reward. Aberdeen could attract private equity, say 
analysts, while Glasgow and Southampton would be likely to catch the eye of infrastructure funds.
Manish Gupta, partner at Ernst & Young, estimates that the midsized airports could fetch between 12 and 15 times 
earnings. "The question BAA will ask is whether this is the right market to sell in, or whether to wait another few 
years?" he said.
Chris Peaker at KPMG agrees. "They would rather keep these than sell for a price that would undervalue their 
assets," he said.
Group's regional hubs up in the air
BAA might also spin off its regional airports rather than sell them piecemeal, giving current investors a chance to 
remain exposed to the regional market.
The company said it had no plans to downsize. "We haven't voluntarily sold any airports," the group pointed out 
yesterday.

Ryanair is reportedly planning on buying a stake in London's Stansted Airport after competition authorities in the UK 
won a court case forcing the break-up of the BAA airport monopoly.
"BAA has decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court and is now proceeding with the sale of Stansted Airport," the 
London-based, Spanish-owned group said yesterday.
The group added that it is still of the belief that the UK Competition Commission failed to recognise that Stansted 
and Heathrow serve different markets.
Ryanair is keen to take a 25pc equity stake in Stansted by joining one of six or so groups it reckons might bid, said 
chief financial officer Howard Miller.
Ryanair head of communications Stephen McNamara said BAA has been cynically blocking the sale of Stansted 
while profiting from their monopoly. "The BAA's seven failed court appeals were nothing more than a blatant 
attempt to delay the sale while BAA and its Spanish owners, Ferrovial, fattened up its monopoly profits at the 
expense of airlines, passengers and British jobs," said Mr McNamara. "It is now time for Ferrovial to get on with 
selling Stansted. "The sale of Stansted into separate ownership will lead to more competition, lower passenger 
charges, improved passenger services, and the roll-out of additional and much needed traffic growth at competitive 
prices in Stansted," he said. South Korea's Incheon International Airport Corp has been monitoring the Stansted 
situation with a view to making an offer should the asset become available, said Tae-Soo Yuh, its aviation 
marketing director. Manchester Airport's chief executive, Charlie Cornish, said the same day he is continuing to 
seek outside funds for the purchase of a "major asset". He said in 2011 his company, owned by 10 local authorities 
around the English city, would look at Stansted should it become available.

BAA has agreed to sell Stansted airport after three years of battling a Competition Commission order for its 
disposal.
A sale will leave the company that once owned London's three biggest airports with just Heathrow and a handful of 
regional facilities, including Glasgow. The operator, an arm of Ferrovial, the Spanish infrastructure group, had 
hoped to cling on to the capital's third-biggest airport by passenger numbers and had fought numerous appeals.
"We still believe that the ruling fails to recognise that Stansted and Heathrow serve different markets," said BAA 
yesterday, but it had decided not to appeal against last month's Court of Appeal ruling which found otherwise. "[We 
are] now proceeding with the sale of Stansted airport."
Several parties are understood to be interested in bidding, including pension and infrastructure funds, and trade 
buyers such as Manchester Airports Group, which would fund a deal by selling a third of its own equity .
Regulated airports such as Stansted, which analysts say could fetch about £1bn, are a rare prize and appeal to 
investors seeking safe, inflation-pegged returns. The risk in these deals usually lies in the capital structure, since 
the multibillion-pound purchases are often highly leveraged.
Serving 17.5m passengers a year, Stansted is the UK's fourth-biggest airport and the third biggest in the capacity-
constrained south-east of England. However, its numbers are a quarter lower than five years ago, as the recession 
has caused a dip in leisure travel.
Stansted's biggest customer is Ryanair, which runs three out of four flights into and out of it and with whom BAA 
has a tortured relationship. Like its rivals, such as EasyJet, the low-cost carrier has moved routes elsewhere as 
airport charges have risen and argues that BAA "is damaging Stansted and harming consumers".
Fifteen other carriers also use the airport, which handles 205,000 tonnes of cargo a year.

Virgin Atlantic is embarking on a significant change to its business strategy by starting to operate short-haul flights 
in the UK.
Some analysts expressed doubts about Virgin's decision to move beyond its long-haul flights.
From March, Virgin will operate a service between its hub at London's Heathrow airport and Manchester, in what is 
supposed to be the first of several short-haul routes.
Steve Ridgway, Virgin's chief executive, insisted that the airline could operate profitable short-haul routes, even 
though some of Europe's flag carriers are struggling to do so because of competition from low-cost carriers led by 
Ryanair and easyJet.
Virgin will use some of its existing take-off and landing slots at Heathrow and Manchester to provide its first short-
haul service.
It hopes to expand its short-haul routes by securing 12 pairs of Heathrow slots that International Airlines Group, 
parent of British Airways, is required to relinquish after its takeover of BMI British Midland.
"I think we will remain overwhelmingly a long-haul operator," said Mr Ridgway. "We will try to build the best short-
haul network we can."
Virgin hopes that many of the passengers that use its short-haul services will transfer on to its long-distance flights 
at Heathrow.
This so-called hub-and-spoke system, involving large numbers of transfer passengers, is used by flag carriers to try 
to fill their long-haul flights.
Virgin lost important transfer traffic when IAG bought BMI from Lufthansa in April. Before the takeover, Virgin had a 
code-sharing agreement with BMI that provided Sir Richard Branson's airline with significant transfer traffic.

John Strickland, director of JLS Consulting, an aviation consultancy, said: "It is unlikely Virgin can deliver a 
profitable short-haul network given the well-established positions of low-cost carriers."
Virgin is appealing against the European Commission's decision to approve IAG's BMI takeover .

MANCHESTER Airport Group (MAG), which owns Manchester, Bournemouth and East Midlands airports, is 
understood to be the frontrunner to make a £1bn bid for Stansted Airport.
Aviation firm BAA revealed yesterday that it is to sell Stansted Airport after it gave up on a long legal battle.
BAA had been fighting a 2009 Competition Commission ruling that forced it to sell Stansted, which handles 17.5m 
passengers and 133,500 flights each year, because of a lack of competition between London airports.
The firm, which is owned by a consortium led by Spain's Ferrovial, has asked banks including Bank of America 
Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley to pitch ideas for the sale process.
MAG previously said in a statement that it was exploring the opportunity "to add a quality airport to the group". It is 
thought to have enough cash on its balance sheet to buy Stansted Airport.
Meanwhile, it is thought that Global Infrastructure Partners, which previously bought Gatwick and Edinburgh 
airports from BAA, has ruled itself out of the bid.
Qatar's sovereign wealth fund could also be a potential bidder for the Essex-based airport, as it bought up 20 per 
cent of BAA last week, underlining its interest in UK airport assets. Budget airline Ryanair, which accounts for three 
out of four flights from Stansted, has also been approached by several potential buyers wanting to join a consortium 
bid. It is understood that the airline is after a 25 per cent stake.
Ryanair has long been critical of BAA and its stranglehold over Stansted, particularly with the fees that it charges 
airlines to use the airport.
BAA's airport sale lures Ryanair and Manchester
"The charges have doubled since 2007," said Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara. He argued that BAA kept 
aviation fees "artificially high" to make the airport more attractive to a future buyer.
Gatwick Airport yesterday welcomed the sale. Stewart Wingate, chief executive of the Sussex airport, said: "The 
Civil Aviation Authority now needs to remove the unnecessary burden of economic regulation imposed when BAA 
was a monopoly, and which threatens to restrict full competition and investment, which will benefit passengers and 
airlines."

THERE are more than a handful of less than busy investment bankers celebrating the decision yesterday by 
Spanish group Ferrovial that it will sell Stansted Airport. The group is finally doing so after three years of wrangling 
with the competition authorities.
The Spaniards have been trying long and hard to avoid a sale, even threatening last month to appeal against a 
Court of Appeal ruling. But yesterday the owners of BAA snapped and gave up the fight.
It is an unwilling seller, having already been forced to sell both Gatwick and Edinburgh airports in response to a 
Competition Commission (CC) report in 2009 into its ownership of seven airports in total in the UK.
The CC felt this was an uncompetitive arrangement and that the UK's airport industry would benefit from more 
varied ownership.
BAA has long argued that Stansted serves a distinct market from Heathrow and therefore that its ownership of both 
airports could hardly be deemed anti-competitive.
Essentially Stansted, which has been losing passengers from a peak of around 24m a year to under 18m, is served 
mainly by two low-cost airlines, easyJet and Ryanair, whereas Heathrow is a hub served by a variety of airlines, 
including major long-haul carriers.
It seems unlikely that Stansted could ever become a major hub because long-haul operators prefer to be where the 
most passengers are.
Stansted considered a prize asset now it is finally being sold
But new ownership has arguably given Gatwick the freedom to market itself for services in all sectors, including 
long-haul.
For example it has attracted the new Asian-based airlines such as Air China, Korean Air and Vietnam Airlines to 
give passengers flying from Gatwick more destinations to choose from.
BAA sources say there are countless slots up for grabs at under-utilised Stansted - for free - but airlines are 
reluctant to give their slots up at Heathrow under any circumstances.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the competition argument, Stansted is seen as a very saleable asset, with 
analysts estimating it could fetch around £1bn or so.
A number of groups are believed to be interested, including the councilcontrolled Manchester Airports Group, which 
is in discussions with a financial buyer over selling a stake.
Also said to be monitoring the situation are South Korea's Incheon and Ryanair, which has said it might take a 
stake but in reality might support a new owner with some guaranteed contracts for a couple of years or so in return 
for some favours on landing charges.
Manchester Airports Group is probably the early favourite given that it is pursuing two key recommendations: one to 
explore the opportunity to add a quality airport to the group and the other, to bring in new equity investment as part 
of the deal.
SFO GETS A MUCH NEEDED BOOST THE SERIOUS Fraud Office (SFO) will be especially relieved at getting a 
result in the long-delayed trial of Asil Nadir, the tycoon who fled the country to go to northern Cyprus in May 1993. 
Nadir's 17-year exile was a major embarrassment for the SFO, which was powerless to seek his return. There were 
then fears the jury might not understand fully some of the complex accounting issues presented to them by the 
prosecution.
Success may not be enough to fully revive the body, though, says Stephen Parkinson of Kinglsey Napley. Fears the 
SFO might be folded into the National Crime Agency and budget cuts have badly affected morale.

AIRLINES have stepped up pressure on the government to scrap a lucrative tax on plane passengers, by 
commissioning an independent report on the cost of the levy to the UK economy.
Virgin, IAG, easyJet and Ryanair have asked consultancy PwC to produce an objective report on the impact of air 
passenger duty (APD), which is paid by travellers taking off from a British airport. APD costs £13 to £184 per 
passenger.
The Treasury expects to receive £2.9bn in air passenger duty this year, after it rose at double the rate of inflation in 
April.
But carriers claim the tax is driving passengers away from British airports in favour of other European destinations. 
They put aside rivalries to lobby for an end to the levy last year and hope to have stats from PwC by autumn.

RYANAIR is said to have held talks about selling off Aer Lingus' landing slots at Heathrow if its takeover bid is 
successful.
The Irish carrier, whose latest (EURO)694m (£545m) bid for Aer Lingus was rejected last month, has spoken to 
Virgin Atlantic and other carriers about offloading the 23 take-off and landing slots, according to the Sunday Times.
The deal would hand Virgin its longed-for chance to expand at Heathrow, while allowing Ryanair to stay away from 
the close-tocapacity airport and its comparatively pricey airline charges.
Aer Lingus, however, is looking to add more slots at Heathrow, as it pursues its own growth strategy while fending 
off Ryanair's advances. Executives at the firm, which declined to comment yesterday, have insisted that the 
company can thrive without its Irish rival's takeover bid.
Ryanair declined to comment, while Virgin did not return calls.

Boardroom: O'Leary in for the long haul

Section: COMMENT
Length: 1060 words
Body
Anyone who thought that Michael O'Leary was engaged in a bit of kite-flying with his recent bid for Aer Lingus is 
likely soon to have to reconsider. The key reason why people were sceptical about O'Leary's bid was that they 
assumed that following a 2007 European Commission decision to block a previous bid, this one would also be ruled 
out because of its impact on competition.
The only way for O'Leary to avoid this happening is to propose a far-reaching plan to persuade the commission that 
there is a way to protect competition, even if Ryanair and Aer Lingus become part of the one organisation.
This requires a wide-ranging disposal of routes and also slots by the merged entity and the agreement of other 
airlines to fly these routes. It appears that just such a plan is exactly what Ryanair has proposed to the commission, 
even though the airline itself has described reports on this as speculation.
In the world of competition law, what we are talking about are 'remedies' -- proposals put forward to fix a situation 
which otherwise would lead to competition being limited in a particular market. Ryanair submitted its cocktail of 
remedies to the commission a few weeks ago, but a tight lid has been kept on the details. With an initial decision 
due from the commission by the end of the month and other airlines, airports and member states to be consulted 
beforehand, the details will surely leak out shortly. An almighty fuss is likely to follow.
If you look at what the EC said in 2007, then you realise that to have any chance of satisfying it, O'Leary will have to 
do two things. The first is to give up a significant number of routes. This will be controversial in itself, though the 
Ryanair offer documents for Aer Lingus did say that it proposed to reallocate Aer Lingus planes to other routes -- 
presumably on European routes not currently covered by Ryanair itself.
The second relates to the belief of competition experts that following the 2007 ruling, O'Leary would also have to 
show that other airlines are lined up to take on these routes in order to ensure competition is maintained. In other 
words, other airlines will have to say, 'yes, we will fly from Dublin in competition with a merged Ryanair/Aer Lingus'.
Boardroom: O'Leary in for the long haul
We can only speculate who these might be, but there are some straws in the wind. Willie Walsh, the former boss of 
Aer Lingus who heads British Airways' parent IAG announced during the week that British Midland, now owned by 
BA, would increase its flights to Dublin from four rotations a day to eight. Heading into the quieter winter season, 
this is a big move.
Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin, which previously concentrated on long-haul, is also starting to shoulder into 
the short-haul market, including from Heathrow. Both of these would be possible players -- as are other European 
airlines -- in routes which a combined Aer Lingus/Ryanair would ditch.
There are other aspects to this battle. During the week, Etihad, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, 
reiterated its interest in buying a significant stake in Aer Lingus. The other big European airlines would see this as a 
significant trampling on their turf.
Meanwhile, the big US players would fear that Etihad, which is based in Abu Dhabi, would use customs pre-
clearance in Dublin to expand its flights to the US. This is not just about Aer Lingus and Ryanair -- it is about a lot 
more than that.
If, as industry sources believe, O'Leary has put such a fundamental package forward, it means he is up to 
something much more significant than flushing out a potential buyer for his Aer Lingus stake.
In the middle of all this is the Irish government, with its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and its quite reasonable 
concerns about the price and regularity of air access to Ireland. It is going to be some battle and -- with the 
European Commission due to start consulting shortly -- it is about (excuse the obvious pun) to take off.
If the commission clears the bid following the Ryanair plan, or on the basis of some further negotiated concessions, 
then suddenly a key plank of the Aer Lingus defence -- that the offer was not capable of being completed -- 
disappears. Suddenly Aer Lingus shareholders have a viable offer on the table. Then it really would be game on. 
But first we will have to see just how Brussels reacts to Ryanair's remedies.
.........................
**Super Mario's rescue plan must work**
One of the striking things about the euro crisis is that there is an extraordinary variation of possible outcomes. 
Nowhere is this more evident than in the argument about whether Ireland will be able to return to the markets. We 
are certainly in a better position than would have been expected in January, with one significant fundraising from 
private investors giving more room for manoeuvre and bond yields easing significantly.
Looking at the next 18 months, however, it is still possible to chart a course to triumph or to disaster. Both are 
plausible. On the positive scenario, the measures announced by ECB chief Mario Draghi are enacted and start to 
calm things. Ireland gets some kind of a deal on our historic banking debts and, with the risk of a debt restructuring 
removed, money starts to flow back into the Irish market. The economy remains weakish, but muddles through.
However, the nightmare scenario is also conceivable. The Draghi measures might not be delivered, speculation 
could grow about a Greek exit and the resulting turmoil could hit confidence across the financial sector, leading to 
destabilising outflows from the periphery and a further lurch back into recession. Suddenly our market return could 
look like a pipe dream.
As the Olympic athletes were fond of saying, the only option for us is to concentrate on our own performance. There 
is not much influence we can bring to bear on what others do and how the wider euro crisis pans out. We have 
gone a good way to removing the market view that Ireland is particularly at risk; now the main factor restraining 
people from investing in our bond market is not Ireland itself, but fears about what might happen at a wider euro 
level.
That said, our domestic economy remains flat and if this does not improve, it will be seen as another economic -- 
and political -- risk factor.
Boardroom: O'Leary in for the long haul
In the short term, however, the euro level risk is the big thing. We need Mario's cunning plan to work.

Ryanair is targeting key deals with British Airways and Virgin Atlantic as part of its efforts to convince the European 
competition authorities to clear its proposed takeover of Aer Lingus. The airline has told the European Commission 
it is willing to give up key routes to ease competition concerns, and is lining up other airlines to take them over.
It has held informal talks with potential suitors, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic and other European 
carriers. "We always talk to lots of airlines about many different matters, but we do not comment on these 
discussions," said a spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic. "We are always looking for opportunities to grow our 
business."
A spokeswoman for British Airways declined to comment. However, the airline has just extended its British Midland 
service between Dublin and London, and sources said it would look at any routes Ryanair sought to offload.
The terms of the 2007 EU Commission decision, which blocked a previous Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus, mean that 
other airlines will have to be lined up to take on routes vacated by the merged operation. The Ryanair offer 
document said that while Aer Lingus would remain based in Dublin, it believed Aer Lingus should open new bases 
in other EU airports.
The European Commission is due to give a preliminary decision on the takeover by the end of this month. This 
could approve or block the bid, or seek further discussions. Before that, other airline players will be asked for their 
views on Ryanair's plan.

David Lane is managing director of Ecclesiastical Insurance, a specialist provider serving the care, education, faith, 
heritage and charity sectors.
The Ecclesiastical group was established in Britain in 1887 and entered the Irish market in 1980, opening an office 
in Dublin. It opened an office in Belfast six years later and currently has 35 staff in Ireland.
Originally set up to insure Church of Ireland premises, Ecclesiastical sells insurance products to all religions, from 
Roman Catholic churches to synagogues and Hindu temples.
.....
**What are the main responsibilities of your job?**
As managing director, I am responsible for developing and executing a growth strategy for our Irish business and 
leading the team to ensure that we deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders while giving something back to 
the communities in which we operate. I am also part of the Senior Executive with responsibility for identifying and 
delivering priorities across the group.
**What motivates you in your job?**
Ecclesiastical is a slightly different insurance company in that we are owned by a charity. We are a very traditional 
insurance firm, built over the years on a culture of strong ethics and values. My goal is to modernise and grow the 
business while retaining this culture.
**How would you describe your work style?**
My style is open and collaborative with a strong emphasis on performance and delivering on individual and 
collective commitments.
Working Week
**What is the most valuable professional lesson you have learned so far?**
The importance of having a strong team and to embrace change from within and outside your business.
**In Ireland, whose career do you most admire and why?**
I admire Michael O'Leary for the way that he has set out and successfully delivered a relatively simple strategy. It is 
very clear to people what to expect and what they will get with Ryanair and he has developed a significant global 
business from a small local base.
**Based on your experience, what is the most valuable career advice you can offer others?**
I would advise people to re-assess their career every few years and make sure that they are following a path that 
still meets their overall objectives. Too often, people just take the next opportunity and end up with their career 
aspirations being dictated by someone else.
**In terms of doing business in Ireland, what do you think is the biggest challenge we face? What would you like to 
see change?**
There is a lot of new regulation being introduced and companies are facing a major challenge in dealing with it. I 
would like to see accountability and transparency through enforcement of existing regulation rather than a steady 
stream of new requirements.
**What is your ultimate professional goal at this point?**
I would like to see Ecclesiastical Ireland as first choice for our customers and partners in our market segment 
because of who we are, what we stand for and the dynamic way we conduct our business.

Be careful what you wish for. The statement of intent by Etihad Airways that it is interested in snapping up a 
substantial stake in Aer Lingus -- by buying the government's stake, or even that held by Ryanair itself -- has gone 
down well with the former national carrier. This is in marked contrast to its negative disposition when it comes to a 
certain other potential suitor. For staff and management of Aer Lingus, it seems to be a simple case of anyone but 
Ryanair and its chief executive, Michael O'Leary.
Ryanair and Aer Lingus have history. Two failed bids have soured relations, and O'Leary's constant criticism of Aer 
Lingus has done little to endear himself to his rival. However, O'Leary has been rather upfront in his plans for Aer 
Lingus. He wants to cuts costs, take on the unions, create synergies with his own airline and take full advantage of 
Aer Lingus's valuable Heathrow slots. He has put a plan to Brussels to maintain competition after a merger of the 
two airlines -- we have still to see the vital detail of this and there are concerns about the cost and availability of 
airline services to Ireland if Ryanair's bid were to proceed.
While O'Leary has put his offer in plain black and white, Etihad and its chief executive James Hogan have yet to put 
any cash on the table. With the exception of a small number of routes out of Dublin, Etihad's main investment in 
Ireland has been to sponsor the GAA's hurling championship. It has not explained what its interest in Aer Lingus is 
or what strategy it believes the airline should adopt. Does Etihad plan to content itself with a minority stake, or does 
it plan to team up with a European airline to take out Aer Lingus completely?
If Etihad can be part of an offer giving the best deal for the airline and its shareholders (including the Irish state), 
then so be it. Likewise, if another player emerges, then they too should be judged on the basis of their plan. But 
ruling out Michael O'Leary on the grounds that he is Michael O'Leary doesn't make sense.
The government will be concerned about what price it will get for its shares. It must, of course, fight for as high a 
price as possible. However, the much more important consideration is the future service levels and competition 
from Irish airports. The tricky thing for the government here is that it is the EU Commission which has the final say 
on whether the Ryanair bid can proceed. It would be a mistake to assume that the bid will be flatly turned down -- 
Battle looming for the future of Irish aviation
this may happen, but Ryanair would not have put cash on the table unless it believed it had a fair shot at getting 
clearance.
Aer Lingus management has made considerable progress in getting the airline back into shape, but that does not 
guarantee that the status quo can be preserved either. The EU Commission could rule against the deal -- or 
demand concessions that make it unviable -- but if it does not, then the government needs to prepare for a situation 
where it is just one player in a very important bidding battle for the future of Irish aviation.

Michael Wright, the entertainment entrepreneur behind the Wright Venue in Swords, plans to open a new nightclub 
and restaurant in the city centre which he hopes will be up and running by Christmas.
The businessman, who controls a chain of 11 bars, restaurants and nightclubs in Dublin, as well as the Airside 
Quarter retail scheme, also revealed to this newspaper that he intends to lease out five bars in the Gilbert and 
Wright chain to concentrate on new projects.
Turnover at the Wright Group was EUR 22 million last year, while profits were up to EUR 1.06 million from EUR 
673,000 in 2010. Wright expects the group to make a profit of EUR 1.4 million this year.
He is attempting to secure a premises for the new city centre venue, which he will model on the Wright Venue.
"We did something dramatic out in Swords, and now I want to do the same in town," he said. "It's hard to find the 
right location, but we have built up our brand and I hope we can be up and running by Christmas."
The Wright Venue, which extends to 50,000 square feet and can cater for over 2,000 people, opened in the 
summer of 2009 and has defied expectations by continuing to attract a sizeable regular customer base that includes 
business firms and local sports clubs.
"We conceived the project long before the [economic] crash, even though we only opened in 2009," said Wright, a 
scion of the Wrights of Howth fish dynasty. "We've actually grown our turnover and profits at the Wright Venue 
since opening. We broke even the first year of trading, had a profit of EUR 500,000 last year, and this year are 
budgeting to be up 20 per cent on that."
He said there were a number of factors which had contributed to the venue's financial performance. "It's free in 
before 11pm, which is very important, and we've reduced the door charge this year to EUR 10 -- it was EUR 15 
during the previous two years," he said.
The Wright stuff for surviving the recession
"We work hard on marketing and promotions, particularly through the likes of Facebook, and on an average Friday 
or Saturday night we could have 400 to 600 people booked in from companies like Google, Facebook, the Dublin 
Airport Authority or Ryanair for a barbecue or a buffet."
Charity events such as the 'Wright Factor', white-collar boxing and, most recently, Strictly Come Dancing are 
regularly held in the club to build a crowd early in the night.
Wright's other businesses include the five bars in the Gilbert and Wright chain, which he is now planning to lease 
out as franchises to another operator, individually or collectively. He is also working on the opening of a new gym at 
the Airside Quarter, where seven of the nine retail units are now leased, and where McDonald's will open an outlet 
next month.
The other businesses in the scheme, which include TGI Fridays, the Wright-owned Penthouse Casino, Pizza Dog 
and O'Brien's Sandwich Bar, together employ 150 people, while the Wright Group separately employs 320 full-time 
and part-time staff.
Wright said the fact that "you couldn't get a cup of coffee" at the Airside Retail Park, home to Harvey Norman and 
B&Q, was one of the reasons he invested in the area.
"Swords has a population of 60,000 people -- that's bigger than the city of Limerick," he said. "I'm from Swords and I 
have businesses in north Dublin, so I know the area very well. I could see the demand for a late-night venue and 
restaurants that would make up for the fact that the retail park was unserviced."
Wright's 23-year-old son Brook also works in the business.
"He keeps me in touch with what the younger generation want," he said. The Wright Group has almost 80,000 
Facebook friends, which Wright described as akin to "having your own magazine".
The group has a full sales and marketing team, and advertises in local media, but Wright said viral marketing is now 
hugely important to his business. He said changing his focus and management style had been crucial to him 
surviving the recession.
"We have restructured our head office and it's very much accounts-driven now. Everything has to be pre-approved -
- our managers can't spend a cent without authorisation from accounts. Rosters are adjusted on a daily basis 
depending on trade. This business has got so tight, it's like running an airline," he said.
"To make money you have to think like Michael O'Leary, but at the same time you have to be creative and offer a 
value experience to the customers so that they will return. I come up with a lot of the creative ideas myself. I work 
around the clock, and I'm in each of the pubs three to four times a week. That's important, because pubs develop a 
character and that's something that has to be built on and retained."

With Etihad, the expansionist Middle Eastern airline, saying it is interested in acquiring a stake in Aer Lingus, the 
Irish government and Ryanair could be jostling to sell their stakes in the flag-carrier.
Etihad, which has a 3 per cent holding in Aer Lingus , has promised in the past to look at the government's 25 per 
cent stake if and when Dublin decides to sell. A deal is one of the government's priorities under plans to reduce 
national borrowing .
But James Hogan, Etihad chief executive, told Bloomberg News this week that he would also be "very happy" to 
talk to Ryanair about purchasing part of its 30 per cent share.
The low-cost carrier is on its third attempt in six years to buy the whole of Aer Lingus . It is expected in the next two 
weeks to submit to European regulators a package of remedies meant to allay competition concerns surrounding a 
potential deal.
The group is offering Aer Lingus investors EUR1.30 a share, which values the company's equity at EUR694m. 
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, is understood to be open to offers for his company's holding.
People close to Etihad said Mr Hogan had not approached Ryanair about a possible share sale. Rules barring 
foreign companies from owning a majority stake in a European airline would prevent Etihad from taking on the 
whole Ryanair holding, since Irish company law stipulates that an investor with 30 per cent of issued shares must 
make an offer for the whole group. That also means any purchase by Etihad of a -significant portion of -Ryanair's 
stake would preclude it from making an offer for the state's holding.
It would also make finding a different buyer for the government stake difficult, said Geof Collyer, an analyst at 
Deutsche Bank who predicted two months ago that Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus was a gambit to sell its own 
holding.
Etihad set to spur jostling over Aer Lingus; TRAVEL & LEISURE
"Our view was that offering EUR1.30 [a share] was them saying, 'This is what we want for our stake'," he said 
yesterday.
Ryanair declined to comment on what it called speculation and rumour.
Its relationship with Aer Lingus is the subject of an investigation by the UK Competition Commission . The regulator 
is looking at whether Ryanair's stake gives it influence over operations of its main rival for flights in and out of 
Ireland.

It is just possible that Ryanair will sell most of its 30 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to Middle Eastern airlines group 
Etihad. But it does not look likely at present. The need to win by chief executive Michael O'Leary is practically a 
compulsive disorder. It is the reason why Ryanair has grown from a small Irish airline to Europe's biggest low-cost 
carrier. It is also one reason why Ryanair is making its third attempt to take over its lossmaking compatriot, offering 
EUR1.48bn for Aer Lingus.
The main obstacle, as ever, is the competitive stranglehold exerted by a combined business that would control 90 
per cent of Irish passenger capacity that is currently split 50/50. To succeed, Ryanair would need to shed a 
significant slice of Irish business to a big airline prepared to base a small fleet at Dublin, and forswear the 
aggressive pricing that would otherwise hasten the venture's demise.
Meanwhile, if Ryanair's EUR1.30 per share offer for Aer Lingus is fairly priced (as Mr O'Leary claims), it could not 
ask the Abu Dhabi-based group for any more without looking duplicitous. Nor would negotiating the deal be any fun 
for Etihad chief executive Mark Hogan. Seating at Ryanair's Dublin HQ is almost certainly unallocated. And there is 
bound to be a charge for coffee and biscuits.

Ryanair this morning said that reports it would pull a number of Aer Lingus routes if it is allowed to take over the 
rival airline are "rumour and speculation".
It was claimed last night that Ryanair was holding discussions with the European Commission's Competition 
Directorate and was offering to curtail a number of the existing Aer Lingus routes to create more competition.
The report on RTE News suggested that pulling certain routes would allow a number of major European airlines, 
including British Airways and Virgin, to operate from routes vacated in the airport.
The proposal is being put to the EU as a means of addressing concerns that a takeover of Aer Lingus would result 
in Ryanair gaining an excessive market share on Dublin routes. It is understood that contact has already been 
made with several large European airlines. The decision to prohibit Ryanair from taking over Aer Lingus in 2006 
concluded that a takeover could "create a monopoly or a dominant position" on 35 routes operated by both parties. 
The Commission investigated Ryanair's proposed remedies and found them to be "inadequate to remove 
competition concerns".

yesterday.
The Gulf carrier, which already owns three per cent of Aer Lingus, would be "very happy to have that discussion", 
he told Bloomberg, adding that Etihad has also been in talks about snapping up the Irish government's 25 per cent

Aer Lingus last month rejected a takeover bid from Ryanair that valued the firm at (EURO)694m (£544m).
Etihad later said in a statement that it is not currently in talks with Ryanair, but is very keen to strengthen our 
partnership [in Dublin]".

VC10der kiss goodbye
The sun is setting on the illustrious career of the Vickers VC10: the big British quad-jet took its final bow at the 
Royal International Air Tattoo in July, half a century after its air show debut at Farnborough.
The type's last operator, 101 Sqn Royal Air Force, is preparing for the tanker's final rundown ahead of a planned 
March 2013 retirement as the UK's new Airbus A330-based Voyagers begin to enter service.
The VC10 made its first Farnborough appearance in 1962, when development aircraft G-ARTA wowed the air show 
crowds just two months after its first flight. Fifty years later, RAF VC10 C1K XV106 made what is expected to be its 
last RIAT flypast.
The last civil VC10 was retired in 1987, but the RAF has operated the type continuously since 1966 from RAF Brize 
Norton, initially in the transport role and since 1984, as a tanker. Ultimately, the RAF operated 28 of the 54 VC10s 
delivered and 101 Sqn has eight tankers left, a mix of ex-10 Sqn C1Ks and ex-airline Super VC10 K3/K4s.
Teddy bears no picnic in Belarus
On 31 July, the office of Belarus's president released a statement ominously titled "Alexander Lukashenko makes 
personnel decisions". For some charged with the defence of the eastern European country, the news was bad. "For 
improper discharge of official duties in ensuring the national security of [Belarus], the following executives have 
been dismissed. Major-General Igor Rachkovsky is no longer the chairman of the state border committee... Major-
General Dmitry Pakhmelkin is no longer the commander of the air force."
The cause of the cull? Swedish teddy bears.

VC10der kiss goodbye
The sun is setting on the illustrious career of the Vickers VC10: the big British quad-jet took its final bow at the 
Royal International Air Tattoo in July, half a century after its air show debut at Farnborough.
The type's last operator, 101 Sqn Royal Air Force, is preparing for the tanker's final rundown ahead of a planned 
March 2013 retirement as the UK's new Airbus A330-based Voyagers begin to enter service.
The VC10 made its first Farnborough appearance in 1962, when development aircraft G-ARTA wowed the air show 
crowds just two months after its first flight. Fifty years later, RAF VC10 C1K XV106 made what is expected to be its 
last RIAT flypast.
The last civil VC10 was retired in 1987, but the RAF has operated the type continuously since 1966 from RAF Brize 
Norton, initially in the transport role and since 1984, as a tanker. Ultimately, the RAF operated 28 of the 54 VC10s 
delivered and 101 Sqn has eight tankers left, a mix of ex-10 Sqn C1Ks and ex-airline Super VC10 K3/K4s.
Teddy bears no picnic in Belarus
On 31 July, the office of Belarus's president released a statement ominously titled "Alexander Lukashenko makes 
personnel decisions". For some charged with the defence of the eastern European country, the news was bad. "For 
improper discharge of official duties in ensuring the national security of [Belarus], the following executives have 
been dismissed. Major-General Igor Rachkovsky is no longer the chairman of the state border committee... Major-
General Dmitry Pakhmelkin is no longer the commander of the air force."
The cause of the cull? Swedish teddy bears.

RYANAIR failed to halt a competition probe into its minority stake in takeover target Aer Lingus.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal yesterday threw out Ryanair's case, allowing an investigation by the Competition 
Commission to continue.
Ryanair tried to argue that the body did not have the power to investigate its 30 per cent stake.
Aer Lingus welcomed the decision, saying in a statement it "looks forward to assisting the Competition Commission 
in its ongoing investigation".
Ryanair, which offered to take over Aer Lingus in June, plans to appeal yesterday's ruling.

Ryanair today said it is still in talks with China's Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) on the possible

The Irish carrier currently operates only Boeing 737s.
The C919 is due to enter service toward the end of the decade.
"We continue to work with the Chinese, even though it's a long-term thing," Ryanair deputy CEO and CFO Howard

asked whether they could make the aircraft's doorways wider so two people could walk through them 
simultaneously, to help with our turnaround times. They're looking into that." Millar added that Ryanair had been 
approached by several consortia interested in taking over London Stansted Airport (STN). Airport owner BAA has 
been ordered by the UK's competition authorities to sell Stansted, which largely handles low cost carrier traffic. BAA 
last month lost the latest in a series of appeals against the decision, but has said it will now appeal to the UK 
Supreme Court.

Viewers of a certain age might recall a classic episode of The Twilight Zone in which a nervous aircraft passenger 
tries, unsuccessfully, to convince the crew that a supernatural creature is sitting on the wing and deliberately tearing 
off parts.
While the presence of an otherworldly entity has yet to be cited as a probable cause by any investigation authority, 
the tale nevertheless reflects a genuine dilemma: whether and when to speak up if, as a passenger, you suddenly 
suspect your aircraft might be unsafe.
Those on board a Ryanair Boeing 737 who witnessed the jet clip an American Airlines 767 at Barcelona must have 
felt, to an extent, like the unfortunate flyer in the movie, certain that something was amiss but powerless to prevent 
the consequences.
There can hardly be a more clear-cut case for kicking up a fuss than watching your jet slice into another. The most 
interesting psychological aspect of the incident is that the passengers, despite seeing the collision with their own 
eyes and conveying their alarm to the cabin crew, did not protest that the flight be halted but instead chose to sit 
uneasily behind their seat-belts while the aircraft proceeded to take off.
Such behaviour is not unprecedented. The investigation into the British Midland 737 crash at East Midlands 
similarly found that many passengers had seen fire in the left engine, and were "puzzled" when the captain referred 
to trouble with the right engine. None brought the discrepancy to the cabin crew's attention. Cockpit authority 
gradient is an aspect of safety familiar to those in crew resource management circles, but there is a far steeper 
slope between the cockpit and the passenger cabin. Even those with specialist knowledge, such as the engineer 
who attempted to stop a British Airways 777 departing from the wrong point of a St Kitts runway in 2009, would 
probably have to wrestle hard with the natural instinct to avoid looking foolish.
Say what you see Passengers must be unafraid to speak out if they observe potential threats to the aircraft in 
which they fly - and cabin crew have a crucial ro....
Which underlines a crucial, if understated, role of the cabin crew: that of a reliable go-between, particularly in an era 
where armoured doors reinforce the separation of pilots from passengers - a separation imposed, ironically, in the 
interests of flight safety.
Demons on the wing do not have to take the shape of a vengeful gremlin. Whether it is towards an undeployed flap, 
a suspicious leak, or the scratched tip from an otherwise-unseen close encounter, the passenger pointing out the 
window needs to know they will be believed.

Ryanair passengers who witnessed a ground collision that damaged their Boeing 737-800 and an American Airlines 
767-300 failed to prevent the aircraft departing after poor crew communication led the pilots to believe the jets had 
not made contact.
Several passengers on the Ryanair service from Barcelona to Ibiza thought the 737 had struck the 767 as it 
attempted to manoeuvre behind the American aircraft, which was waiting at a holding point for runway 25L.
But although one passenger spoke to a flight attendant, Spanish investigators state that "deficiencies in the 
communications" between cabin crew and the pilots meant that the severity of the incident went unrecognised.
Both aircraft subsequently took off. While the 737 was later found to have a scratched starboard winglet, the 767 
had a gash in its left-hand horizontal stabiliser, and was withdrawn from service for repair.
Spanish investigation authority CIAIAC, citing cabin crew statements, says that as the passenger left their seat to 
speak to the flight attendant, several other passengers "nervously looked out the windows on the right side".
"They were speaking in Spanish, so the cabin crew did not understand very well what they were saying," it adds. 
"Another passenger told them in English that some passengers thought they had hit the other [aircraft]."
But when the message was relayed to the cockpit, only a single call-chime was used - as opposed to three chimes 
for a serious problem - and the captain "did not sense much concern" in the flight attendant's voice.
Both 737 pilots were already aware of the tight clearance and, as the jets converged, had been in the process of 
verifying the separation. Shortly before the cabin call, the captain had stopped the 737 and left her seat to check the 
distance, and reassured the co-pilot that the two aircraft were not touching.
Flights departed in spite of collisionHeadline to come headline to come headline to Passengers on board 
Ryanair 737 witnessed damaging strike on American 767 bu....
"The captain was under the impression that only one passenger had witnessed the contact, and not several as she 
later discovered," says CIAIAC.
"She said that her decision to continue with the flight would probably have been different if she had known that 
several passengers had reported contact."
During the flight one of the passengers - who said he was an engineer - expressed concern at the decision, under 
the circumstances, to proceed with the departure.
"After deplaning in Ibiza, several passengers also voiced their preoccupation over the situation," adds CIAIAC.
Neither of the pilots of the American 767 had been aware of the collision, despite the damage to the stabiliser.
CIAIAC says that while the Ryanair passengers' reports were relayed to the cockpit, the flight attendant "seems to 
have been unaware of the safety implication of the information she was providing", and her manner of expression 
indicated "hesitation" as to whether she ought to have been interrupting the pilots.
"During the flight to Ibiza several passengers expressed their unease over the incident to the cabin crew, but at no 
point did the [flight attendants] contact the pilots to convey the passengers' concerns," it adds.
Ryanair's procedures specifically state that cabin crew must not assume that the pilots are aware of serious 
problems. Investigators have nevertheless recommended that the carrier reassess its training for on-board 
communications.
CIAIAC says the cockpit-voice recorders were overwritten and acceleration information from the flight-data recorder 
could not identify the precise moment of the collision, and investigators could not draw up a detailed analysis of the 
geometry.
But the inquiry points out that the 767 had initially been waiting 50-60ft (15-18m) from the holding point. Its crew 
had been aware, from radio transmissions, that the 737 was experiencing difficulty passing behind, and 
subsequently moved the larger jet about 15ft closer to the holding point - although the collision had already 
occurred by this time.
Neither the captain nor co-pilot were aware of the ground contact

Budget carrier Ryanair's talks with Chinese airframer Comac about a possible aircraft order remain in the early 
stages and any resultant deliveries would be "towards the end of this decade", at the earliest.
Ryanair chief financial officer Howard Millar outlined the status of the talks with Comac as the Irish airline disclosed 
its first-half results.
Millar says the Chinese manufacturer, which is developing the C919 twinjet, is more willing to alter design plans to 
accommodate Ryanair's requirements.
"They are willing to listen to what we want," he says. "[An aircraft] that's manufactured by Boeing or Airbus is a one-
size-fits-all, whereas what we want is a really efficient low-cost aircraft." He cites Ryanair's request for wider 
doorframes to facilitate faster boarding and disembarking as one such modification which Comac is considering.
"If two people can walk through the door, so the door's wider, we could actually get people on and off the aircraft 
quicker," Millar says, emphasising the need for faster turnaround times.
Ryanair agreed last year to work with Comac on the design of the C919, although it has not committed to acquire 
the type. The carrier is nearing the end of deliveries from its big order for Boeing 737-800s and is yet to reach a 
new aircraft deal covering future growth.

EasyJet July Passengers, Load Factor Rise
EasyJet July Passengers, Load Factor Rise

Body
(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline easyJet Plc (EZJ.L) Monday said total number of passengers for the month of July 
increased 8 percent, while its load factor - a capacity utilization measure, edged up from last year.
In July, total passengers, representing the number of earned seats flown, grew to 5.86 million from 5.43 million in 
the previous year. The company noted that earned seats include seats that are flown whether or not the passenger 
turns up because easyJet is a no-refund airline. Earned seats also include seats provided for promotional purposes 
and to staff for business travel.
Load factor in July grew 0.8 percentage points to 92.5 percent.
In June, total passengers climbed 9.7 percent and load factor was 89.9 percent, an increase of 1.6 percentage 
points from last year.
For the rolling 12 months ended July 2012, passenger numbers improved 7.5 percent to 57.8 million, and load 
factor rose 1.6 percentage points to 88.8 percent.
Last month end, easyJet reported a 10.5 percent increase in its third-quarter revenue. For the quarter ended June 
30, seats flown grew by 7.5 percent and passengers carried increased by 10.9 percent. Load factor increased 2.8 
percentage points to 89.1 percent.
Total revenue per seat in the quarter was up 4.7 percent at constant currency, driven by targeted capacity allocation 
into higher yielding markets, the success of the 'europe by easyJet' campaign and the recently launched mobile 
app.
At that time, the company stated that around three quarters of summer seats have now been booked, in line with 
the previous year, revenue per seat at constant currency continues to perform in line with expectations. Fourth-
quarter revenue per seat is anticipated to be broadly in line with the third quarter.
Last week, Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported over 29 percent drop in profit for the first quarter, as 
higher fuel costs more than offset an 11 percent rise in revenues. Its quarterly yield increases were dampened by 
the EU wide recession, austerity measures, and heavily discounted fares at new base launches.
easyJet shares are currently trading at 576.5 pence, up 4 pence or 0.7 percent in London.

Highlight: Australian group to take 35% equity
Deal conditional on airport acquisition
Body
An Australian infrastructure group has positioned itself as a bidder for London's third-biggest airport, Stansted, after 
winning the contest to buy a £1bn stake in Manchester Airports Group.
The deal agreed with Industry Funds Management - which fought off competition from Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong 
billionaire - is conditional on MAG winning any future contest for Stansted, which UK competition authorities have 
ordered its owner BAA to sell.
MAG, which is owned by the 10 councils of Greater Manchester, is keen to add Stansted to its airport portfolio and 
has laid out plans for a part-privatisation that would raise money for a deal. The agreement with IFM, worth about 
£1bn, according to people close to the discussions, would give the Australians 35 per cent of MAG's equity but an 
equal share of voting rights with Manchester City Council.
The other shortlisted bidders were Cheung Kong Infrastructure, which is Mr Li's investment vehicle, and a joint 
venture by UK private equity group 3i and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. People close to the contest said IFM 
offered more money for MAG and promised to put more into a Stansted bid.
The timing of a sale of Stansted remains uncertain because, BAA, a division of Spanish infrastructure group 
Ferrovial, is still fighting a 2009 order to sell the facility. It is seeking a Supreme Court hearing after having its case 
rejected by the UK Court of Appeal last week.
Should a Stansted sale go ahead, analysts expect the airport to fetch about £1bn. It is likely to attract a wide range 
of potential investors, including trade buyers, infrastructure funds and pension funds.
MAG eyes Stansted bid after £1bn stake sale TRAVEL & LEISURE
Ryanair, the airport's dominant carrier, has said it has spoken with potential buyers about taking part in a bid . But 
one person close to the Manchester deal said he would be surprised if the airport group was in talks with the low-
cost carrier.
As well as Manchester airport, MAG owns East Midlands, Bournemouth and Humberside airports - though it 
announced the sale of its 82 per cent stake in Humberside this week.
Under the terms of the IFM deal, Manchester City Council will see its equity stake diluted from 55 per cent to 35 per 
cent. The 45 per cent equity stake held by nine other local councils will be reduced to 30 per cent and they will give 
up their voting rights.
A Stansted bid would not be MAG's first attempt to enter the London market. Three years ago, it made an offer for 
Gatwick but lost out to Global Infrastructure Partners, which also owns London City airport and this year paid BAA 
£807m for Edinburgh airport.

Highlight: Airline group cuts full-year guidance
Plans drawn up for Spain eurozone exit
Body
International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, yesterday cut its financial guidance for 2012, 
saying it expects to make an operating loss this year because of Spain's economic crisis .
The group is preparing to make job cuts at Iberia, its Spanish subsidiary, after IAG reported a pre-tax loss of 
EUR390m in the first half of 2012.
IAG also disclosed that it has set up a eurozone crisis management unit, which is meeting every two weeks to 
consider the implications for the group of a possible Spanish exit from the single European currency.
IAG was previously seeking to break even at the operating level this year, but now expects to make a "small 
operating loss" after restructuring costs. The group's shares closed down more than 5.2 per cent yesterday at 151p.
Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, said a root-and-branch restructuring plan for Iberia should be finalised by 
September. "Inevitably we will not be able to avoid job losses as part of the process," he added.
The restructuring could further exacerbate tense industrial relations at Iberia , where pilots went on strike this year 
in protest at the creation of a low-cost carrier, Iberia Express.
Mr Walsh did not rule out moving Iberia Express's domicile outside Spain after an arbitration ruling in May required 
Iberia to put all pilots on the same pay scale even if working conditions in the two parts of the company were 
different.
He said IAG's preference was for Spain to retain the single currency, because of the risk that the country's exit from 
the eurozone could help to trigger a global recession.
IAG was formed last year from the merger of BA and Iberia. The two subsidiaries are reporting contrasting results.
Iberia 's troubles weigh on IAG TRAVEL & LEISURE
BA recorded a EUR13m operating profit for the six months to June 30, partly thanks to demand for long-haul flights 
over the North Atlantic, while Iberia reported a loss of EUR263m.
Iberia has been buffeted by a combination of recession and strong competition from low-cost carriers led by 
Ryanair.
IAG reported revenue of EUR8.5bn for the six months to June 30, up 9.8 per cent compared with the same period 
last year.
But a 25 per cent increase in fuel costs, coupled with Iberia's weakness, pushed IAG to a pre-tax loss of EUR390m, 
compared with a profit of EUR39m that it reported in the first half of last year.
Net debt rose from EUR1.2bn at December 31 to EUR1.3bn at June 30.
Gerald Khoo, an analyst at Espirito Santo, said that IAG's cut to its full-year guidance was "not a huge 
disappointment", but he added that analysts' estimates could be reduced in response.

Highlight: Both Coface and UK Export Finance are close behind US Ex-Im in providing a pre-funded bond option.
Body
Newly merged carrier Latam closed the first fully 100% pre-funded bond earlier this month. Ryanair has also 
mandated a US Ex-Im backed pre-funded bond to finance seven 737s.
While it has been know that UK Export Finance (ECGD) is also offering the same product, a financier has told 
Airfinance Journal that Coface also has plans to offer pre-funded bonds.
& Who will do it next is anyone&s guess. It could be Coface, or it could be UK Export Finance. The thing is that with 
US Ex-Im it is more straightforward to do & at least for now,& says the financier.
Malaysia Airlines had been rumoured to be in line for a pre-funded UK Export Finance bond. However a banker 
whose bank has been mandated on the deal says that there is not enough time before delivery for that to be an 
option, though a normal bond issuance remains likely.
Aviation finance is steadily moving towards the debt capital markets as banks& ability to raise US dollars has 
diminished due to the sovereign debt crisis.
Air finance veterans will be used to the cyclical nature of funding gap fears, funding gap averted, a proposed move 
to the capital markets & and then business carrying on as normal.
However another banker tells Airfinance Journal: & There is no better time than now to do it. You have all the right 
factors coming together. Some banks can&t raise US dollars like they used to and are less willing to put large 
heaps of cash onto the balance sheet. The capital markets are perfect for staying in the game.&
But another financier says of the bond market: & It can open up & like it has now & but then suddenly close. That 
can happen overnight.&

Highlight: Banks expect to fund more lessors by 2013.
Body
In 2013, lessors may become bank's core clients, rather than airlines.
Banks are already heavily servicing lessors. Lessors own about 30 to 40% of today's global commercial aircraft 
fleet. Some in the industry say this figure could rise to 50% over the next few years prompting a further demand for 
capital by lessors.
Allied to that, banks are becoming more risk averse in who they lend to. Over the past few years banks have 
undergone capital restrictions in the form of Basel III and EBA demands, have been exposed to both the financial 
and the sovereign debt crisis and many banks have struggled to access dollar liquidity.
These competing pressures banks may cause a shift in lending behaviour for aviation banks.
A financier tells Airfinance Journal that his bank is already embarking upon a roadshow campaign with lessors, as 
his group is looking to finance the lessors more next year.
"We're explaining in detail what we can do for them," the financier says.
If lessors can be described as airlines that do not fly, then it is easy to see why banks would prefer to invest in 
them. Simply, inherent risks airlines carry are not there. Plus, any risk is diversified as jets are placed with 
numerous carriers - rather than just relying on one entity for repayment, the lessor has many.
Banks will of course continue to finance airlines, but there may be an increasing move towards funding tier one 
credits only.
Capital market activity
Capital markets are seen as the alternative to the banking market. While Latam, Ryanair and Lion Air to name a few 
have recently closed some good deals, lessor have been able to do this for some time - in both secured and 
unsecured issuances.
Air Lease Corporation launched a successful IPO last year, ILFC regularly taps the capital markets, and AerCap, 
Awas and Aircastle also use the capital markets.
Analysis: The lure of leasing
ILFC priced an unsecured $750 million 10-year bond today. The bond carries a coupon rate of 5.875%.
Another financier tells Airfinance Journal that while most lessors can use the capital market, it is only the top airlines 
that can use the capital markets.
"It's not a solution for the less well-run airlines," he says.
Lessors become less risky
Bank constraints will also have a significant impact on lessors' fortunes. A harsher financing climates may actually 
spell good news for aviation lessors.
Commercial debt tenors may also shorten due to Basel III's capital requirements. Tier two and tier three carriers 
have in the past had access to cheap debt. With Basel III and the NASU, that is likely to change.
If that change occurs, seven to ten-year old aircraft will become easier to place as riskier credits will not be able to 
access the capital to buy new jets. That will be welcome news to lessors with fleets whose average age is 
beginning to creep up towards seven years.
Lessors will inevitably form a greater part of aviation banker's portfolio. Even if one excludes sale leasebacks 
lessors still accounted for 16.3% of all aircraft deliveries from Boeing and Airbus in the last quarter of 2012 - a huge 
proportion of the market. For good or bad it appears that banks will look to lessors more to drum up new business.

Body
IRISH airline Aer Lingus, which is trying to resist a takeover bid by larger rival Ryanair, yesterday posted an 18 per 
cent boost in operating profits in the three months to June and said it would at least match last year's profit 
performance.
The former Irish flag-carrier said yields per passenger were up 5.3 per cent compared to the same period last year 
and revenues were up seven per cent.
"If current trends continue, Aer Lingus' operating profit, before net exceptional items, for 2012 will be at least that 
achieved in 2011," chief executive Christoph Mueller said in a statement. Last year's figure came in at 
(EURO)49.1m (£38.m).
Ryanair, the largest shareholder in Aer Lingus with a 30 per cent holding, is in talks with the European Commission 
to clear a (EURO)694m takeover bid announced last month.
Aer Lingus, in which the Irish government holds a 25 per cent stake, reiterated its call for shareholders to reject 
Ryanair's offer, which it says the Commission will likely block.
The firm told shareholders yesterday that a takeover would not make sense financially, due to the large overlap in 
routes with Ryanair and the (EURO)1.30 per share bid price.
Aer Lingus shares closed up 1.85 per cent at (EURO)1.10 yesterday - below Ryanair's offer price.

Body
Aer Lingus urged shareholders yesterday to reject Ryanair's takeover offer , saying it posed a greater threat to 
competition than a bid by the low-cost carrier blocked by the European Commission in 2007.
The Irish flag carrier said the number of routes out of Ireland, where the two are the only operators, has risen from 
22 in 2007 to 44 in 2012, and concluded that the commission was likely to veto Ryanair's bid.
The statement of objection to Ryanair's third takeover bid for Aer Lingus in six years came as the flag carrier 
reported interim results in which its underlying operating loss narrowed to EUR4.4m in the six months to June 30 
from EUR26.9m in the same period last year.
Aer Lingus said if current trends continue its 2012 operating profit should at least match the EUR49.1m recorded in 
2011. The shares closed up 1.85 per cent at EUR1.10.
Colm Barrington, Aer Lingus' chairman, told shareholders in a letter: "Your board has received legal advice that the 
European Commission is likely once more to prohibit the Ryanair offer as the number of routes into and out of 
Ireland that Ryanair would monopolise has sharply increased."
Ryanair has not spelt out concessions that it might offer to secure the commission's approval but Mr Barrington said 
that Ryanair could be willing to relinquish some of Aer Lingus' take-off and landing slots at London's Heathrow 
airport.
"This could jeopardise both future competition and connectivity from Ireland via Heathrow, as some airlines 
interested in securing valuable Heathrow slots may commit to operate them on routes to Ireland for a limited period 
of time only," he said.
In its offer launched in June, Ryanair offered EUR1.3 per Aer Lingus share, valuing the equity at EUR694m.
Aer Lingus said it was significantly undervalued by the offer, noting that its gross cash position of EUR1.1bn implied 
the carrier was worth EUR1.96 per share.

The carrier reported revenue of EUR626.3m for the first half of 2012, up 10.1 per cent on the same time last year. 
Pre-tax loss rose from EUR13.7m in the first half of 2011 to EUR24.5m in the same period this year. This was 
caused primarily by exceptional costs, including a planned relocation of Airbus A330 maintenance from Shannon to 
Dublin, and EUR4.3m of advisory fees relating to Ryanair's bid.
Gerard Moore, an analyst at Merrion, said the results were slightly better than expected but the exceptionals were 
"disappointing".

The United Arab Emirates' flag carrier said today it was not in talks with Ryanair to discuss buying the Irish airline's 
30% stake in Aer Lingus, according to local news sources.
Etihad has held talks with the Irish government, which is seeking to offload its 25% stake in Aer Lingus.

passenger numbers for its second financial quarter.

Highlight: The carrier's board says Ryanair's offer fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus.
Body
Aer Lingus board has repeated its recommendation to shareholders to reject Ryanair's latest takeover bid. In July, 
the Irish flag carrier published a 30 page circular to its shareholders explaining its reasons for rejecting Ryanair's 
offer.
"Since the issuance of this circular, no new information has been provided by Ryanair in relation to the Offer and 
the Board re-affirms its recommendation that shareholders should reject the Offer," says Aer Lingus in a statement.
Aer Lingus says the offer of Eu1.30 per share represents a discount of 34% to Aer Lingus' gross cash of Eu1.96 per 
share.

Profit taking from a five day rally sent the ISEQ lower today with investors waiting to see whether European 
policymakers would back up pledges to support the euro zone with concrete steps.
The ISEQ was closed 26.34 points lower at 3,169.25.
Expectations for action from the European Central Bank to tackle the debt crisis were triggered by its president 
Mario Draghi who said last week that the bank would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, a message echoed 
by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande. Some investors however were 
sceptical, seeing plenty of scope for market disappointment if the ECB does not announce bold measures to tackle 
the crisis after its meeting on Thursday.
Shares in Aer Lingus rose 2c to E1.10 while Ryanair lost 3c to E3.97 after Aer Lingus management today wrote to 
its shareholders urging them to reject Ryanair's latest bid to take over the former flag-carrier saying that it 
undervalues the airline. The sending of the 30-page document to stake holders comes as Aer Lingus this morning 
reported a pre-tax loss of E24.5 million for the first six months of the year, an increase of 79pc on the same period 
in 2011. It said the loss was exacerbated by a number of exceptional items, including E11.7 million spent on 
restructuring, and E4.3 million on advisory fees as part of the airline's defence of Ryanair's takeover bid. Chief 
executive, Christoph Mueller, said the results show revenue has increased by 10pc compared with a year earlier, 
while operating costs increased by 5.8pc- largely due to a 29.6pc increase in fuel costs and an 8.1pc increase in 
airport charges. CRH's stocks fell 71c to E14.95. Its global peer, HeidlebergCement has reported Q2 EBITDA of 
E698m (+7pc year-on-year, +4pc like-for-like) versus the Davy forecast of E660m and consensus of E680m. The 
result included a E22m gain from the sale of a quarry in Canada which boosted what was in effect an in-line result. 
Group sales rose 11.4pc yoy (+6pc like for like - LFL) to E3.78bn. The group's Q2 EBITDA margin fell 70bps yoy to 
18.5pc from 19.2pc in Q2 2011 (EBITDA margins were down 130bps yoy in Q4 2011 and 210bps in Q1 2012). The

strongest result was in North America where Q2 EBITDA rose 46pc yoy (+36pc LFL). Cement volumes in the region 
increased by 11pc yoy with cement margins +440bps yoy. Aggregates sales increased slightly with the margin 
result artificially boosted by the quarry sales in Canada. Western Europe was weak with EBITDA down 26pc yoy (-
28pc LFL). Cement volumes were down just 2.7pc yoy with Germany still strong but UK and Benelux weak. In 
Eastern Europe, EBITDA fell 11pc yoy (-7pc LFL) as cement volumes rose 2.4pc yoy, driven by Russia.

Aer Lingus management today wrote to its shareholders urging them to reject Ryanair's latest bid to take over the 
former flag-carrier saying that it undervalues the airline.
The sending of the 30-page document to stake holders comes as Aer Lingus this morning reported a pre-tax loss of 
E24.5 million for the first six months of the year, an increase of 79pc on the same period in 2011.
It said the loss was exacerbated by a number of exceptional items, including E11.7 million spent on restructuring, 
and E4.3 million on advisory fees as part of the airline's defence of Ryanair's takeover bid.
Chief executive, Christoph Mueller, said the results show revenue has increased by 10pc compared with a year 
earlier, while operating costs increased by 5.8pc- largely due to a 29.6pc increase in fuel costs and an 8.1pc 
increase in airport charges. Long-haul performance remained strong, with passenger volumes and yield up, and

Aer Lingus management today wrote to its shareholders urging them to reject Ryanair's latest bid to take over the 
former flag-carrier saying that it undervalues the airline.
The sending of the 30-page document to stake holders comes as Aer Lingus this morning reported a pre-tax loss of 
E24.5 million for the first six months of the year, an increase of 79pc on the same period in 2011.
It said the loss was exacerbated by a number of exceptional items, including E11.7 million spent on restructuring, 
and E4.3 million on advisory fees as part of the airline's defence of Ryanair's takeover bid.
Chief executive, Christoph Mueller, said the results show revenue has increased by 10pc compared with a year 
earlier, while operating costs increased by 5.8pc- largely due to a 29.6pc increase in fuel costs and an 8.1pc 
increase in airport charges. Long-haul performance remained strong, with passenger volumes and yield up, and 
retail revenue also rose. Mr Mueller said he will continue to focus on operational and financial performance during 
the summer travel months and believes its operating profit, before net exceptional items, will be at least the E49

Body
(RTTNews) - Aer Lingus Group PLC (AERL.L) reported second quarter pre-tax profit of 11.4 million euros, lower 
than 42.7 million euros in the prior-year quarter. The company said prior-year results were restated.
Total revenue grew 6.7% to 374.8 million euros from the prior-year quarter. Total passenger volumes increased 
1.2% despite broadly flat year-over-year capacity deployment.
Moving ahead, the company expects that, if current trends continue, operating profit, before net exceptional items, 
for 2012 will be at least that achieved in 2011.
Aer Lingus is paying its first dividend of three Euro cents a share on 31 July 2012, amounting to approximately 16.0 
million euros in aggregate terms. Subject to the above conditions, the Board would also expect to pay an annual 
dividend of approximately 3 euro cents per share in each of the next two years.
Separately, Aer Lingus Group said it has today written to shareholders outlining its reasons for recommending 
rejection of Ryanair Holdings plc's (RYAAY, RYA.L) offer to purchase the whole of the issued and to be issued 
ordinary share capital of Aer Lingus not already owned by Ryanair.
Aer Lingus Board unanimously recommends that shareholders reject Ryanair's Offer of 1.30 euros per share. The 
company's board's unanimous view is that Ryanair's Offer to acquire control of Aer Lingus for 1.30 euros per share 
fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus urged shareholders take no action and do not complete any 
Form of Acceptance.

As jittery fliers know well, lack of visibility usually means the ride will be bumpy. This is being so widely cited by 
European airlines as they look ahead to the winter that investors may also want to brace. Yesterday, neither 
Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, nor Air France-KLM, the French-Dutch flag carrier, cared to predict in any 
detail how the difficult economic climate - and prospect of more airline failures - would play out, particularly in terms 
of demand and ticket prices.
There, though, the similarity ended. Ryanair's first quarter after-tax profits were EUR100m, compared with 
EUR140m a year earlier and one-fifth lower than consensus estimates. But the year-on-year fall was driven largely 
by a EUR120m increase in the fuel bill. Investors had been hoping the carrier would push up ticket prices by about 
7 per cent. In fact, the rise was 4 per cent, due partly to some "promotional" pricing as new bases in the likes of 
Spain, Hungary and Poland are developed. Ryanair will again ground more than a quarter of its fleet this winter 
and, with the fuel cost impact declining as the year wears on, is holding to 2012-13 net profit guidance of 
EUR400m-EUR440m. The balance sheet remains commendable.
By contrast, Air France-KLM made a EUR895m after-tax loss in the same quarter (its second) after a EUR370m 
restructuring provision and large "fair value" adjustments to hedging contracts. The EUR66m operating loss was 
better than expected, with stronger-than-anticipated passenger yields and load factors. But a big restructuring has 
yet to be pushed through and net debt is EUR6.2bn, or 130 per cent of shareholders' funds.
For investors, the sector offers some opportunities: European airline shares overall have outperformed this year. 
And on 12 times forward earnings, Ryanair's shares are not pricey. That said, it may not be the smoothest of rides 
ahead.

Ryanair has reported subdued fare rises in its first quarter and said it expected more of the same for the rest of the 
year as the   eurozone crisis and recession continue to weigh on customers' willingness to spend.
The low-cost carrier lifted its average fare by 4 per cent to EUR44 in the three months to the end of June - an 
anaemic increase compared with last year's 16 per cent surge.
The growth was lower than expected and saw Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers miss forecasts for net 
income by 20 per cent. Adjusted profits after tax fell by almost 30 per cent to EUR99m year on year, dragging down 
earnings per share from 9.35 cents to 6.86 cents.
The shares nevertheless rose 2.3 per cent to EUR4, a 20 per cent improvement on the price at the start of the year.
Howard Millar, chief financial officer, said this should be a time for the airline to raise fares, since capacity growth 
has slowed. But he blamed the poor European economy for Ryanair's inability to drive price increases higher.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, said growth in yields was "dampened by the EU-wide recession, austerity 
measures and heavily discounted fares at our new bases". He added that while next winter's trading remained 
opaque, he expected those factors would continue to restrain fare growth.
But the company maintained its full-year guidance for between EUR400m and EUR440m in net profit, assuming 
non-fuel costs are level with last year's and fuel costs moderate, as expected.
The airline's fuel bill was EUR117m higher than last spring, although Mr Millar said the cost should come down later 
in the year.
Ryanair expects to benefit from airline consolidation   , which should reduce the number of flights further, and is 
attempting to take part in the drive by buying Irish rival Aer Lingus. Mr Millar declined to comment on the deal.
Ryanair says fare rises to remain low
He said, however, that Ryanair was still engaged in talks with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China over its 
180- to 200-seat single-aisle aircraft   .
Baggage charges are included in Ryanair's average fare calculations. But ancillary revenues such as commissions 
on hotel and car rental rose at twice the rate of fares in the first quarter, which Mr Millar admitted was unusual 
considering the hesitation with which people spent money on tickets.
Passenger numbers rose 6 per cent but that is expected to fall to 4 per cent for the full year.

RYANAIR yesterday blamed the spiralling cost of jet fuel for a 28 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to (EURO)112.5m 
(£87.9m) for the quarter.
The budget airline said its fuel costs had risen 27 per cent on last year to a whopping (EURO)544m, accounting for 
almost half of all operating expenses.
Even hedging 90 per cent of its fuel costs for the year to March cannot offset the surge in market prices - it has 
hedged at around $1,000 per tonne, or 21 per cent up on last year.
Ryanair said revenues rose 11 per cent to (EURO)1.28bn in the quarter, and it maintained its full-year profit 
forecast of between (EURO)400m and (EURO)440m.
Ancillary sales, such as baggage fees and onboard snacks, rose 15 per cent to (EURO)286m.
However, the rocky economic outlook for Europe looks set to hinder further fares growth this year, the firm warned.
"There is no sign of a Europeanwide economic recovery. There doesn't seem to be any light at the end of the 
tunnel," chief financial officer Howard Millar said.
The firm did not comment on its bid to take over Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier that reports its interim results 
today. Ryanair shares dipped in early trade, but recovered to close up 2.2 per cent at (EURO)4.

European stocks started the week with airlines and banks making the biggest gains.
Crédit Agricole rose 7 per cent to EUR3.58, Intesa Sanpaolo was ahead 6.6 per cent at EUR1.06 and Bankinter 
was up 4.4 per cent at EUR2.53.
Sentiment was lifted by continued speculation that the European Central Bank would take action to ease Spanish 
and Italian borrowing costs. Italy's 10-year yields eased below 6 per cent in an auction yesterday morning.
The Spanish and Italian benchmarks outperformed their peers, with the Ibex up 2.8 per cent to 6,801.8 and the 
FTSE MIB ahead 2.8 per cent to 13,978.04.
Slowing demand for advertising in Europe hit sales at JCDecaux , the company reported. It said the economic 
malaise was spreading from Spain, Italy and Greece to countries in central and northern Europe, including 
Germany.
Sales fell 4.2 per cent in Europe and the world's largest outdoor advertising company expects this trend to continue 
in the third quarter. The stock fell 6.9 per cent to EUR17.00.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was ahead 1.6 per cent to 1,072.97 with all but two sector groups making gains. France's 
CAC 40 gained 1.2 per cent to 3,320.71 and Germany's Dax was up 1.3 per cent at 6,774.06.
Airlines made ground, led by Air France-KLM, which more than halved its second-quarter operating loss from a year 
earlier to EUR66m. The group told unions there was no alternative to restructuring plans. Revenue gained 4.5 per 
cent to EUR6.5bn, with its passenger business improving despite cargo being hit by sluggish demand. The shares 
gained 18.6 per cent to EUR4.62.  Lufthansa was ahead 3.2 per cent to EUR10.41.
Ryanair shares gained 2.4 per cent to EUR4.00, erasing a fall of as much as 5 per cent. However, profits fell 29 per 
cent in the second quarter as slow demand limited its ability to increase fares while higher fuel prices lifted costs.

Syngenta slid 0.8 per cent to SFr335.6 after the world's largest agrochemicals company was downgraded to "sell"

Last week the company gained 1.4 per cent after beating expectations and claims that it would capitalise on the

Irish airline Aer Lingus has reported a 73 percent drop in second quarter pretax profit but predicted that full year 
profit would at least match its performance last year.
For the six months ending June 30, Aer Lingus reported a pretax profit of (EURO)11.4 million ($14 million), down 
from (EURO)42.7 million a year earlier. Revenue was up 6.7 percent to (EURO)375 million.
Operating profit was up nearly 18 percent but pretax profit was diminished by a charge of (EURO)19.8 million for 
exceptional items, including (EURO)4.3 million for fighting a takeover bid by budget airline Ryanair.
Aer Lingus also published a letter to shareholders urging them to reject Ryanair's bid which values the airline at

Aer Lingus has reported a pre-tax loss of E24.5m for the six months to the end of June.
The airline noted that it is typically loss making in the first half of the year.
Revenues for the six month period rose by 10pc to E626.3m from E569.1m, while operating losses fell to E4.4m

Factored into the figures are a number of exceptional items including E4.3m in costs incurred as a result of the

month period, an increase of 3.4pc on the same time last year. Average yields per passenger rose by 6.3pc. The 
airline's operating costs in the first half of the year increased by 5.8pc mainly due to a 29.6pc increase in fuel costs 
and an 8.1pc increase in airport charges. "Aer Lingus has produced a good trading performance in the seasonally

The main Dublin shares index rebounded further towards the 3,200 level today, prompted by renewed hope and 
expectation that the ECB will soon announce bold action to prevent the eurozone debt crisis from engulfing Spain 
and even Italy.
The ISEQ closed up 49.70 points to 3,195.59.
Spanish and Italian yields fell sharply on Friday as speculation continued to grow that official intervention in 
European bond markets is now likely. Spanish ten-year bond yields fell back to 6.8pc, with Italian yields falling back 
below 6.0pc. Equity markets joined in the rally with the Euro Stoxx 50 Pr up 2.2pc, the FTSE 100 1.0pc and the 
S&P500 up 1.9pc. Following ECB president Draghi's comments on Thursday that he was ready to take action to 
preserve the euro, a story in Le Monde on Friday indicated that a new plan for the EFSF to buy Italian and Spanish

Body
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, undershot analyst forecasts with a profit slide of 29 percent in the three 
months to June as it grappled with a toxic mix of austerity, recession and stubbornly high fuel prices.
The Dublin-based airline, famous for its no-frills service, said the weak economic outlook for Europe would continue 
to restrain fare growth for the rest of the year, but maintained its forecast of a profit of between 400 million euros 
(dollar 494.80 million) and 440 million for the year to March.
"Austerity is biting. There is just less money around," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar. "There are no 
particular bright or black spots."
Net profit for three months to June was 99 million euros, compared with a forecast of 123 million by four analysts 
polled by Thomson Reuters. Earnings per share were 6.9 euro cent in the quarter, compared to an average analyst 
forecast of 9 cents.
The airline, which has a lower cost base than many of its competitors, said it had hedged 90 percent of its fuel 
needs for the year to March at approximately dollar 1,000 per tonne, up 21 percent on last year. But it said the fuel 
price savings would be more than offset by a lower euro to dollar exchange rate. Average fares were up 4 percent, 
in line with mid-single digit growth forecast by the airline in May, and were on track for average growth of around 3 
percent in the year to March, Millar said. The airline does not expect to change plans to ground 80 of its 270 planes 
over the winter due to high fuel costs, Millar said. "With oil prices at dollar 100 per barrel it really doesn't makes 
sense to fly these aircraft," Millar said. "The more you fly, the more you lose." Ryanair's share price closed at 3.92 
euros on Friday, up 7.5 percent since the start of the year, compared to a rise of 8.4 percent in the broader Irish 
market. Poor weather in the United Kingdom boosted sales at budget rival easyJet Plc in the three months through 
June, pushing revenues up by 10.5 percent.. But European carriers, including Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, have 
Ryanair profits undershoot by 29pc Ryanair results
seen recent results hit by high fuel costs, weak consumer confidence and the euro zone crisis. Ryanair said it was 
involved in "an extensive process of engagement" with the European Commission in its bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus, 
but it said it would not comment further. ( C) Reuters

Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, undershot analyst forecasts with a profit slide of 29 percent in the three 
months to June as it grappled with a toxic mix of austerity, recession and stubbornly high fuel prices.
The Dublin-based airline, famous for its no-frills service, said the weak economic outlook for Europe would continue 
to restrain fare growth for the rest of the year, but maintained its forecast of a profit of between 400 million euros 
(dollar 494.80 million) and 440 million for the year to March.
"Austerity is biting. There is just less money around," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar. "There are no 
particular bright or black spots."
Net profit for three months to June was 99 million euros, compared with a forecast of 123 million by four analysts 
polled by Thomson Reuters. Earnings per share were 6.9 euro cent in the quarter, compared to an average analyst 
forecast of 9 cents.
The airline, which has a lower cost base than many of its competitors, said it had hedged 90 percent of its fuel 
needs for the year to March at approximately dollar 1,000 per tonne, up 21 percent on last year. But it said the fuel 
price savings would be more than offset by a lower euro to dollar exchange rate. Average fares were up 4 percent, 
in line with mid-single digit growth forecast by the airline in May, and were on track for average growth of around 3 
percent in the year to March, Millar said. The airline does not expect to change plans to ground 80 of its 270 planes 
over the winter due to high fuel costs, Millar said. "With oil prices at dollar 100 per barrel it really doesn't makes 
sense to fly these aircraft," Millar said. "The more you fly, the more you lose." Ryanair's share price closed at 3.92 
euros on Friday, up 7.5 percent since the start of the year, compared to a rise of 8.4 percent in the broader Irish 
market. Poor weather in the United Kingdom boosted sales at budget rival easyJet Plc in the three months through 
June, pushing revenues up by 10.5 percent.. But European carriers, including Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, have 
Ryanair profits undershoot by 29pc Ryanair results
seen recent results hit by high fuel costs, weak consumer confidence and the euro zone crisis. Ryanair said it was 
involved in "an extensive process of engagement" with the European Commission in its bid for Irish rival Aer Lingus, 
but it said it would not comment further. ( C) Reuters

Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, undershot analyst forecasts with a profit slide of 29 percent in the three

The Dublin-based airline, which is waiting to hear whether EU regulators will approve its takeover of Aer Lingus, 
said the weak economic outlook for Europe would continue to restrain fare growth for the rest of the year.
"There is no sign of a European-wide economic recovery. There doesn't seem to be any light at the end of the 
tunnel," Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar told Reuters Insider TV.

by four analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Earnings per share were 6.9 euro cent in the quarter, compared with 
an average analyst forecast of 9 cents. Ryanair's shares were down 2.0 percent on a flat Irish market at 0850 GMT. 
Rival Air France-KLM was up 11 percent after halving its operating loss on improved passenger activity. "The 
bottom line is that recession and austerity are having bigger impacts than the market had expected," said Merrion 
Capital analyst Gerard Moore. The airline, which has a lower cost base than many of its competitors, said it had 
hedged 90 percent of its fuel needs for the year to March at approximately dollar 1,000 per tonne. That is up 21 
percent on last year, but lower than current market prices. The cost of the remaining 10 percent will be lower than 
expected at the start of the year, but this saving will be more than offset by a worse euro to dollar exchange rate, 
the company said in a statement. Average fares were up 4 percent, in line with mid-single digit growth forecast by 
the airline in May, and were on track for average growth of around 3 percent in the year to March, Millar said. The 
airline will go ahead with already announced plans to ground 80 of its 270 planes over the winter due to high fuel

which complements its own lower-cost regional network. Last week, the European Commission, which acts as EU 
competition watchdog, said it would decide by Aug. 29 whether to clear Ryanair's dollar 841 million bid for Aer 
Lingus. Ryanair said it would not comment further. Poor weather in the United Kingdom boosted sales at budget 
rival easyJet Plc in the three months through June, pushing revenues up by 10.5 percent. Ryanair, has roughly half 
as much exposure to the United Kingdom. Most European carriers continue to struggle with high fuel costs, weak 
consumer confidence and the euro zone crisis. (C ) Reuters

(RTTNews) - The UK market is in positive territory in afternoon trading Monday, as hopes remained that policy 
makers will act decisively to resolve the region's debt crisis. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said 
last week that the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.
Italy's borrowing costs for ten-year funds fell below 6 percent at a debt auction as investors look forward to some 
crucial moves from the European Central Bank, which holds its rate-setting session later in the week. The Italian 
Treasury sold a total 5.48 billion euros bonds maturing in 2015, 2017 and 2022, against a maximum target of 5.5 
billion euros.
Meanwhile, Spanish economic output sank further in the second quarter, deepening the recession in the euro 
area's fourth largest economy. The gross domestic product fell 0.4 percent in the second quarter of 2012 after a 0.3 
percent decline each in the first quarter of 2012 and in the fourth quarter of 2011.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti have vowed to defend the euro amid 
escalating tensions in Eurozone, close on the heels of a similar agreement between Merkel and French President 
Francois Hollande.
During a telephone conversation on Sunday, Merkel and Monti agreed that both the countries "will do everything 
possible to protect the euro area," reports said.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is adding 1.00 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is rising 0.91 percent.
The FTSE 100 is rising 0.51 percent.
HSBC is adding around 1 percent after reporting first-half results. Barclays is gaining 2.8 percent and Royal Bank of 
Scotland is advancing about 2 percent.
Evraz is surging 3.9 percent and Weir Group is adding 3.7 percent.
Ryanair is up half a percent after the low-cost airline reported over 29 percent drop in profit for the first quarter, as 
higher fuel costs more than offset an 11 percent rise in revenues. The company said its outlook remains cautious 
for the year, while remaining unchanged.
UK Market Gains
Pearson, which reported results last week, is falling 2.8 percent.
Reckitt Benckiser is falling 0.8 percent. The firm reported a marginal decline in its second-quarter revenue, but said 
it is confident of achieving its full-year 2012 target of 200 basis points above its market growth rate of 1 to 2 percent.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX is adding 0.76 percent and the French CAC 40 is gaining 0.58 percent. 
Switzerland's SMI is rising 0.40 percent.
In economic news, German wholesale trade turnover rebounded in June after declining for the past three months, 
the Federal Statistical Office said. Wholesale sales increased 4 percent year-on-year in June following a 2.8 
percent fall in May.
Across Asia/Pacific, most major markets ended higher. Australia's All Ordinaries climbed 0.77 percent and Hong 
Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.80 percent. However, China's Shanghai 
Composite Index lost 0.9 percent amid worries of growth cooling off.
In the U.S., futures point to a lower open on Wall Street. In the previous session, markets benefited from some 
relatively upbeat U.S. economic data as well as news out of Europe. The Dow jumped 1.5 percent, the Nasdaq 
soared 2.2 percent and the S&P 500 spiked up 1.9 percent.
In the commodity space, crude for September delivery is adding $0.08 to $90.21 per barrel and gold for August 
delivery is rising $0.2 to $1618.2 a troy ounce.

Ryanair Q1 Profit Falls 29% As Fuel Costs Escalate - Update

(RTTNews) - Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYAAY, RYA.L) Monday reported over 29 percent drop in 
profit for the first quarter, as higher fuel costs more than offset an 11 percent rise in revenues. The company said its 
outlook remains cautious for the year, while remaining is unchanged.
The company noted that quarterly yield increases were dampened by the EU wide recession, austerity measures, 
and heavily discounted fares at new base launches.
For the quarter ended June 30, profit attributable to equity holders of parent fell to 98.8 million euros ($121.4 
million) from 139.3 million euros in the prior year.
Pre-tax profit was 112.5 million euros compared to 156.6 million euros last year.
Total operating revenues climbed to 1.28 billion euros from 1.16 billion euros last year, helped by a 6 percent 
increase in traffic and a 4 percent rise in average fares.
Total revenue per passenger for the period rose 5 percent, while load factor slid 1 point to 82 percent.
Unit costs climbed 10 percent mainly due to a 27 percent increase in fuel costs. Fuel amounted to 47 percent of 
total operating costs.
Excluding fuel, unit costs rose by 3 percent, supported by cost control, despite increases in flight crew pay, charges 
at certain airports and the impact stronger Sterling against the Euro.
Rival easyJet Plc. (EZJ.L) last week said in the third quarter ended June 30 that revenue increased by 10.5 percent 
to 1.033 billion pounds.
Ryanair is 90 percent hedged for fiscal 2013 at around $1000 pt, up 21 percent from last year. About 50 percent of 
requirement for the first half of 2014 has been hedged at $940 pt, but these lower fuel prices will be more than 
offset by lower euro to dollar exchange rates.
Ryanair said high oil prices and Europe's recession would drive further consolidation and more airline closures this 
winter, and hopes to gain more growth opportunities from these changes.
Ryanair Q1 Profit Falls 29% As Fuel Costs Escalate - Update
The company expects full-year traffic to grow 4 percent, with 7 percent growth in the first half and 1 percent in the 
second half due to winter capacity cuts. The firm sees smaller fuel cost increases due to higher comparable last 
year and the company's fuel saving measures.
Ryanair said currently it has no visibility of next winter's yields, but expects austerity, EU recession, and lower yields 
at new bases to restrain fare growth.
Until the airline gets some yield visibility for the second half, its guidance for fiscal 2013 remains unchanged, in the 
range of 400 million euros to 440 million euros.
RYA.L is currently falling 3.7 percent in morning trade at 3.76 pence.

  Dutch delivery company TNT Express 's second-quarter results were once expected to be an afterthought, with 
the company awaiting its takeover by UPS in September, writes Matthew Steinglass .
But this month the European Commission competition watchdogs announced the deal would go into a phase two 
review, contending the merger might result in excessive dominance in some markets.
The companies have since pushed the settlement date back to December. Analysts expect the deal will go through, 
but TNT Express might be required to divest operations in some markets first - where exactly, no one knows.
In the meantime, the company's results announcements have suddenly become more interesting, particularly in 
terms of insights from management about what preparations might be needed to ensure the merger goes through.

  When UBS reports its second-quarter earnings the focus will be on the Swiss bank's wealth management 
operations, which Sergio Ermotti, the chief executive, has prioritised, writes James Shotter .
Corporate Diary INTERNATIONAL
Rivals Julius Baer and Credit Suisse both enjoyed a reasonable second quarter in spite of client caution amid 
uncertain macroeconomic conditions, and investors will be keen to see if UBS's private bank has kept pace.
The consensus among analysts is that UBS will report net income of EUR955m on revenues of SFr6.8bn, both 
figures about 6 per cent down on the past year.
Investors will also want to know how its plan to cut SFr2bn in costs by next year is progressing. Following Credit 
Suisse's SNB-inspired capital raising, UBS's capital position will also be under scrutiny. The group is targeting a 
Basel III core tier one ratio of 13 per cent and investors will expect an update on progress.
However, the real question mark is Libor. UBS is likely to be the next bank to settle with regulators, and while that is 
not expected before the autumn, any update is sure to make waves.
  Deutsche Bank revealed this month that profits would be below market expectations in the second quarter but left 
investors and analysts seeking answers to further crucial questions when the bank publishes detailed earnings 
figures, writes James Wilson .
Deutsche's capital situation, plans for cost-cutting including job losses, and possible consequences for the bank 
from global regulators' investigations into manipulation of the Libor interest rate, are all expected to be significant 
issues for investors.
These are the first results published by Deutsche since Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen took over as co-chief 
executives on June 1. Deutsche is likely to be tight-lipped on broader strategic questions, including plans to 
restructure its asset and wealth management businesses, having said it will give more details of the new chiefs' 
strategy in September.
  Jim Smith, who was named chief executive of Thomson Reuters in December, is not getting much of a 
honeymoon, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson .
With its stock roughly where it was when he arrived, investors are impatient for better news, particularly about its 
new Eikon financial data product, but expectations are not high as it announces second-quarter results.
Piper Jaffray expects "continued negative revenue trends" in the markets and risk business, where it estimates a 1 
per cent organic decline amid stiff competition in a tough environment for financial clients.
Legal revenues have also slowed as large US law firms have become more cost-conscious, Bernstein Research 
notes, despite good take-up of Westlaw's new legal research tools.
Mr Smith pleased analysts with the sale of Thomson Reuters' healthcare division, and the bolt-on acquisition of FX 
Alliance, a provider of foreign exchange trading tools. Analysts, however, want details of cost-cutting plans, 
particularly if Eikon's slow take-up delays the end of legacy products.
"A rebound in revenue growth, which we believe is at least a year away, will be required to generate increased 
investor enthusiasm," Piper Jaffray analysts said.

  Weir Group unveils interim results amid hopes from investors that the FTSE 100 engineering company might 
have seen out the worst of a backlash against the stock this year, writes Michael Kavanagh .
The Glasgow-based company held guidance on full-year profits at about £470m at a trading update in May.
But a fall in demand for fracking equipment in the US and concerns over a slowdown in spending by miners has 
weighed on the industrial pump supplier. These concerns have seen the shares slump from their year's high of 
£22.43 in February to below £14 in June.
Since then, upbeat results from leading oil services group Baker Hughes and Schlumberger this month, plus some 
reassurance on demand from mining clients, have prompted a mini-rally in the stock. Weir traded above £16 on 
Friday, up on a 52-week low of £13.52 six weeks ago.
Analysts will look for interim revenues of about £1.3bn and pre-tax profits of about £220m for the six months, as 
earnings are expected to be slightly skewed towards the second half of 2012.

  BAE Systems ' bigger rival Lockheed Martin reported impressive earnings this month, pleasantly surprising 
investors perhaps lulled into a sense of doom and gloom by its chief executive's constant warnings about looming 
US defence cuts, writes Carola Hoyos .
With so much of BAE's business coming from the Pentagon, it makes sense to keep a close eye on whether US 
lawmakers fail to pass a federal budget, thereby automatically triggering a £500bn defence spending cut over the 
next nine years. But BAE has had some much-needed success elsewhere, signing a long-awaited £1.6bn Saudi air 
force training deal, and is busy cutting its cost base by reducing its workforce and consolidating factories.
That should be enough to achieve "modest growth in underlying earnings per share", according to the company's 
most recent guidance.
Meanwhile in the UK, the Ministry of Defence appears gradually to be getting its act together, having balanced its 
budget and given guidance on where it will spend its much shrunk fortunes over the coming decade. That is useful 
for BAE and others in the defence industry, with huge overheads, long lead times and a customer base one can 
count without running out of fingers.
  Several insurers are likely to take a financial hit from the summer of floods, but analysts expect Royal Sun 
Alliance  to be one of the worst affected as it reports half-year results, writes Alistair Gray .
The FTSE 100 company said this month it expected to face at least £50m worth of claims resulting from the recent 
downpours, as well as £35m from earthquakes that struck northern Italy in May.
As a result of the lowered guidance, analysts have pencilled in a fall in pre-tax profits from £376m to £227m on net 
written premiums of £4.4bn (£4.19bn). Yet few expect the losses to be serious enough to force a cut to the interim 
dividend.
The shares yield 8.5 per cent, one of the highest in the FTSE 100 index, and Deutsche Bank is forecasting the 
interim payout will rise 2 per cent.
Meanwhile, investors will look beyond the recent claims for signs of underlying operational improvement under 
Simon Lee, who replaced Andy Haste as chief executive in November.

(RTTNews) - Budget airline Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported a drop in first-quarter profit attributable 
to equity holders of parent to 98.8 million euros or 6.83 euro cents per share, from 139.3 million euros or 9.33 euro 
cents per share a year earlier. The company attributed the 29% decline in profit after tax mainly to a 27% increase 
in fuel costs, offset by a 4% increase in average fare and strong ancillary revenues.
Pre-tax profit amounted to 112.5 million euros, a decrease from 156.6 million euros in the prior-year quarter.
However, total operating revenues on continuing operations went up 11% to 1.28 billion euros from 1.16 billion 
euros last year, as traffic grew 6% and average fares up 4%. Total revenue per passenger for the period rose by 
5%, whilst load factor decreased by 1 point to 82% compared with the year-ago quarter.
The company said its fiscal 2013 guidance remains unchanged in the range of 400 million euros - 440 million euros, 
as previously guided, until it gets some second-half yield visibility.

BAA loses out again on sale of Stansted
BAA loses out again on sale of Stansted

Body
BAA has lost a key legal challenge to overturn an order made by competition regulators forcing it to sell Stansted 
airport.
The Court of Appeal dismissed arguments by the airports operator, owned by the Spanish infrastructure group 
Ferrovial, and upheld a decision by the Competition Appeal Tribunal ordering the sale .
BAA now plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, the UK's highest court but is coming close to exhausting its options 
through the UK legal system.
The court battle stems from a ruling by the Competition Commission in 2009 which found that BAA wielded unfair 
market power by owning three London airports and ordered it to sell Stansted and Gatwick.
BAA has already sold Edinburgh and Gatwick to Global Infrastructure Partners but continued to fight the 
competition regulators on Stansted in litigation which has so far lasted three years.
This week, Nicholas Green QC, acting for BAA, told the Court of Appeal that there were risks if the airports operator 
had limited time to sell the airport "in the midst of the worst financial gale known to the industry for many decades".
In written arguments BAA contended that the "cost" of it being forced to sell assets at a time not of its choosing 
could amount to a "very substantial diminution" in value of the likely proceeds of sale.
It also claimed in the written arguments that the earlier Competition Tribunal "erred in law" by its original 2009 report 
because by 2011, plans for new runways had been scrapped and "any competition dependent on the prospect of 
new runway capacity had to be discounted".
Should the Supreme Court decide not to hear the case, or uphold the Court of Appeal's judgment, analysts expect 
Stansted to fetch at least £1bn, or 12 times last year's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
BAA loses out again on sale of Stansted
Edinburgh Airport, which BAA sold this winter - also prompted by the 2009 market-power decision - went for £807m, 
or 17 times ebitda.
However, Stansted is regulated, meaning that the user fees it charges airlines are held in check and linked to 
inflation, and so it is seen as a less attractive target.
The airport has also seen a steep decline in passenger numbers in recent years and is dominated by Ryanair, the 
low-cost airline which accounts for three-quarters of traffic.
Meanwhile Ferrovial saw profits decline over the first half of the year as growth in its foreign services and 
construction divisions failed fully to offset falling activity in its recession-hit domestic market.
The company, which has weathered the collapse of Spain's construction industry through international 
diversification and asset sales, said first-half net profits declined by 15.2 per cent to EUR265m compared with a 
year ago and including a net capital gain from the sale of Edinburgh airport of EUR100m.
Revenues for the period grew 3.3 per cent to EUR3.66bn. Ebitda rose by 15.2 per cent to EUR440m.

BAA has pledged to fight on in its attempts to keep Stansted Airport, despite losing a Court of Appeal hearing 
yesterday.
Judges yesterday upheld the Competition Commission's 2009 ruling that BAA exerted a dominant hold on airports 
in Scotland and south east England.
BAA, which also owns Heathrow, sold off Edinburgh Airport in April but has mounted several appeals against the 
order to dispose of Stansted.
"We will now consider its judgement carefully and we intend to submit an appeal to the Supreme Court," the firm 
said in a statement.
Ryanair, however, welcomed the ruling, criticising BAA's stance as "a blatant attempt to delay the sale".
Legal experts were sceptical of BAA's chances in further appeals.
"BAA has done well to hang on to Stansted for three years following the CC's original decision. With the benefit of 
hindsight, it might conclude that it would have done better to sell the airport in 2009 than now, given the decline in 
the economic situation in that time," said Rosemary Choueka, Lawrence Graham LLP's head of EU, competition 
and regulation.

Body
The EU Commission has ruled that the Irish air travel tax is unfair and has ordered Ireland to recover the advantage 
from all airlines that had benefited from it.
The main beneficiaries are Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Arann.
In 2009, Ireland introduced an air travel tax for flights departing from Irish airports. The tax was set at E2 for 
destinations at maximum 300 km from Dublin and at E10 for all others.
The Commission found that the lower rate favoured flights within Ireland and to nearby parts of the UK, giving the 
companies concerned an economic advantage over their competitors. In a separate conclusion, the Commission 
found that the financial arrangements between the airport of Tampere Pirkkala (Southern Finland) and Irish no-frills 
airline Ryanair do not constitute state aid in the meaning of EU rules. They are therefore perfectly legal, thus closing 
an investigation that was opened in 2007 following a complaint by a competitor airline. As per an arrangement 
concluded with Ryanair, the airline pays an 'all inclusive' charge differing from the terms offered to other airlines at 
the airport. The Commission's investigation found that this agreement respected market terms as it was concluded 
on terms that a private investor operating under market conditions would have accepted. "The agreements are 
based on an ex ante business plan showing profitability expectations and therefore confer no economic advantage 
to Ryanair. The business results of the airport further confirm these expectations," said the Commission.

Ryanair is cutting three routes to Spain and reducing the number of flights to the country's two main cities in a row 
over airport taxes.
Taxes paid by airlines at Madrid and Barcelona airports will be doubled as the country struggles to reduce its 
spiralling deficit.
Ryanair routes between Manchester and Madrid, East Midlands and Barcelona El Prat and Leeds Bradford and 
Barcelona El Prat, will be scrapped from November.
The no-frills airline will also reduce capacity on 24 routes from Madrid and 22 from Barcelona, including flights 
connecting with Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and Dublin. Chief executive Michael O'Leary said: 'Ryanair objects 
to the Spanish government's decision to double airport taxes at both Madrid and Barcelona airports. Sadly, this will 
lead to severe traffic, tourism and job cuts at both airports this winter. Ryanair's cuts alone will cause a combined 
loss of 2.3m passengers and more than 2,000 jobs at Madrid and Barcelona El Prat airports to other lower-cost 
airports elsewhere in Europe, where Ryanair continues to grow.' Barcelona and Madrid, which are state-owned, will 
lose 492 Ryanair flights per week between them.

One thing is clear: The way airlines make money these days is completely different than it was just five years ago.
 Ancillary revenue grew to $22.6 billion in 2011, a rise of 66 percent in two years. This is according to a new report 
commissioned by leading travel technology partner Amadeus and carried out by IdeaWorksCompany. The survey 
looked at ancillary revenue activity for 108 airlines around the world -- 50 of which disclose ancillary revenue activity 
-- to identify growth patterns.
 "We've seen the industry move swiftly to grasp some clear opportunities for providing ancillary services, such as 
baggage fees, extra legroom and on-board catering," said Holger Taubmann, senior vice president of distribution at 
Amadeus. "The next wave of innovation in ancillary services will come from those airlines that develop new 
products that support their brand positioning and deliver value to the traveler by meeting their individual needs and 
preferences."
 The study found that ancillary revenue, once largely limited to low-fare airlines, is now the lifeblood of many large 
carriers worldwide -- and big companies, according to the researchers, generate big results. The top 10 list of 
ancillary revenue generators is dominated by major brands in the global network.
 United Continental led the pack in terms of total revenue, generating $5.2 billion in ancillary fees. Delta ($2.5bn), 
American ($2.1bn), Qantas ($1.4bn) and Southwest ($1.2bn) rounded out the top five, with European budget 
carriers easyJet and Ryanair close behind. Delta was the only airline in the top 10 to see its ancillary revenue 
decrease year-on-year. Southwest, meanwhile, joined the top 10 list for the first time. Though it does not charge 
fees such as one for checked baggage, it has embraced the sale of convenience-added services.
 Based on percentage of total revenue, budget carriers led the way and, according to the survey, rely on ancillary 
fees as a matter of financial survival. Spirit Airlines generated a whopping 33 percent of its profits from additional 
charges. Budget carriers Jet2.com, Allegiant, easyJet and Ryanair all generated more than a fifth of their profits 
from ancillary fees in 2011. Allegiant and Jet2.com reside in the top 10 largely based on their ability to sell total 
vacation packages.
 Qantas, meanwhile, made the most per passenger with the average traveler spending nearly $51 per trip on 
supplemental charges. The majority of that revenue came from the Qantas Frequent Flyer Program, backed by the 
power of its Australian network of co-branded credit cards.
 Jay Sorensen, president of IdeaWorksCompany, noted a vast change over the five years his company has 
conducted the survey.
 "Our first report into ancillary revenue was issued in 2007, when only 23 airlines worldwide disclosed ancillary 
revenue activity in financial filings, and the result was a modest $2.45 billion," he said. "Four years later, 50 airlines 
Airlines Reap $22.6B In Ancillary Revenues
today disclose ancillary revenue activity of $22.6 billion. It's clear that airlines recognize the importance of ancillary 
revenue and are developing increasingly innovative ways to generate this."
 Unique services include the following: KLM now charges 12 to 15 euros on select flights for preordered meal 
upgrades. Qantas sells RFID-equipped bag tags that allow passengers to bypass lines at the ticket counter. Vueling 
will hold the middle seat empty, board you early and provide a drink and snack for around $73. Air Asia will give you 
its Red Carpet Service of elite-style perks for about $25.
 Sorensen said the survey results describe an evolution that is occurring in how travel is sold to consumers -- an 
evolution fueled by creative add-ons. The gold rush mentality of "grab every buck, quid or kopek while you can," he 
said, has become a relic of the past.

The Dublin stock market started out in positive territory with a two point gain this morning but after that blip it was 
downhill all the way to a 32 point loss at the end of the day to 3,206 in late trading.
The news from around Europe depressed sentiment as the euro currency hit new lows against a number of 
currencies. Spain dominated the headlines firstly with the E100bn bank rescue loan facility approved by European 
finance ministers. This facility was so well heralded that it had no positive impact on sentiment.
Of greater import was the news that Valencia - one of the largest Spanish provinces - has requested a bail-out from 
the Spanish Treasury. Analysts wonder how many other high-spending Spanish provinces need assistance and 
how long will it take for the Spanish Government to seek a real bail-out from the EU and IMF.
As the euro-zone's fourth largest economy, A Spanish bail-out will not be as easy to facilitate as Greece or Ireland.
Most of the leading Irish shares ended the day with losses. Ryanair, which coincidentally is reducing its flights into 
Spain because of higher airport taxes, fell 1c to E4.09. Paddy Power fell E1.06 to E53.67 while Kerry fell 95c to

Body
The board of Aer Lingus has rejected Ryanair's takeover approach as "not credible" given the regulatory hurdles it 
faces.
The Irish flag-carrier told shareholders yesterday that its low-cost rival's EUR1.30 a share offer - which was set out 
in detail on Tuesday - stood a good chance of being blocked by the European Commission, according to legal 
advice received by Aer Lingus's board.
Regulatory approval is seen as the biggest challenge to a deal, since the European Commission rejected an 
attempt six years ago by Ryanair to buy its national rival. Another bid in late 2008 was dropped before reaching 
European regulators.
"The reasons for prohibition are now even stronger than before: the number of routes that Ryanair would 
monopolise has sharply increased," Aer Lingus said yesterday.
The board also urged shareholders to ignore the offer on valuation grounds, pointing out that the EUR694m all-cash 
bid represents a 17 per cent discount to the company's net asset value per share, and that "the gross cash on Aer 
Lingus's balance sheet more than pays for Ryanair's offer".
This "represents a significant discount to the intrinsic value of the business", the company said.
Aer Lingus shares have fallen more than 50 per cent since flotation in 2006. But the company says it has executed 
a turnround in recent years as evidenced by a EUR130m improvement in operating profits since 2009.
Aer Lingus is set to give a more detailed defence document in the next two weeks. Its shares were flat at EUR1.07, 
while Ryanair's dipped slightly.

IRISH flag carrier Aer Lingus yesterday urged shareholders to reject a takeover bid from Ryanair, its larger rival, 
saying the offer is "not credible".
Ryanair already owns 30 per cent of its rival and on Tuesday made an offer that values Aer Lingus at around 
(EURO)694m (£544m).
Aer Lingus said any bid is likely to be blocked by competition regulators.
"Consequently there is significant uncertainty that any offer from Ryanair would be capable of completion," the firm 
said.

Body
Irish airline Aer Lingus predicted competition regulators would continue to block a takeover by Ryanair as it 
repeated its call for shareholders to reject the latest 694 million euro (dollar 849 million) offer from its rival.
Ryanair published its offer document on Tuesday, fleshing out its third bid for Aer Lingus which offers shareholders 
1.30 euros per share in a move aimed at increasing its stake to at least 50 percent from just under 30 percent.
Ryanair needs the approval of the European Commission, which in 2007 blocked an earlier bid on competition 
grounds, and Aer Lingus said the reasons for another rejection on these grounds had increased in the interim.
"Ryanair's 2006 offer was prohibited by the European Commission on competition grounds, and your board 
believes that the reasons for prohibition are now even stronger than before: the number of routes that Ryanair 
would monopolise has sharply increased," Aer Lingus said today.
"Your board has received legal advice that the European Commission is likely once more to prohibit the Ryanair 
Offer, and that this is not therefore a credible Offer which is capable of completion." The former flag carrier, in which 
the state still retains a 25 percent stake, repeated that it believes Ryanair's offer undervalues the company. Ryanair 
said on Tuesday that the offer was open for acceptance until Sept. 13. ( C) Reuters

Highlight: Irish airline Aer Lingus predicted competition regulators would continue to block a takeover by Ryanair 
as it repeated its call for shareholders
Body
Irish airline Aer Lingus predicted competition regulators would continue to block a takeover by Ryanair as it 
repeated its call for shareholders to reject the latest 694 million euro (dollar 849 million) offer from its rival.
Ryanair published its offer document on Tuesday, fleshing out its third bid for Aer Lingus which offers shareholders 
1.30 euros per share in a move aimed at increasing its stake to at least 50 percent from just under 30 percent.
Ryanair needs the approval of the European Commission, which in 2007 blocked an earlier bid on competition 
grounds, and Aer Lingus said the reasons for another rejection on these grounds had increased in the interim.
"Ryanair's 2006 offer was prohibited by the European Commission on competition grounds, and your board 
believes that the reasons for prohibition are now even stronger than before: the number of routes that Ryanair 
would monopolise has sharply increased," Aer Lingus said today.
"Your board has received legal advice that the European Commission is likely once more to prohibit the Ryanair 
Offer, and that this is not therefore a credible Offer which is capable of completion." The former flag carrier, in which 
the state still retains a 25 percent stake, repeated that it believes Ryanair's offer undervalues the company. Ryanair 
said on Tuesday that the offer was open for acceptance until Sept. 13. ( C) Reuters

Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar has said the Government is not ruling out Ryanair's bid for its stake in Aer 
Lingus, but was under no obligation to respond for 60 days. These are the terms of the formal offer which launched 
recently.
"I'm a little bit restricted in what I can say because of the rules of the Irish takeover panel, but the Government is 
considering the offer but we'll have to take into account a number of things," he said.
Mr Varadkar said the Government would consider what was best for the taxpayer in terms of price and what was 
best for the passenger in terms of "competition and connectivity and cargo".
A potential competition ruling also had to be taken into account, he added. "It is something that we're considering. 
We're certainly not ruling out the bid, but we're under no obligation to respond for 60 days, and let's see what else

Body
(RTTNews) - Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L) said its Board's unanimous view is that Ryanair's (RYAAY, RYA.L) 
Offer to acquire control of Aer Lingus for 1.30 euros per share fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's Offer represents a significant discount to the intrinsic value of the business, a discount of 31% to Aer 
Lingus' gross cash per share of 1.87 euros. Ryanair's Offer also represents a discount of 17% to Aer Lingus' Net 
Asset Value per share of 1.56 euros based on the NAV shown in the 31 December 2011 balance sheet.
Aer Lingus noted that its Board believes Ryanair's Offer is not in the interests of shareholders or Aer Lingus and is 
incapable of completion. Accordingly, the Board of Aer Lingus unanimously recommends shareholders should take 
no action in relation to the Offer and should not sign any document sent by Ryanair or its advisers.

Narrowbodies
International Airlines Group, the British Airways and Iberia parent, sprang a major surprise at the show with the 
announcement that it will be co-operating with Chinese airframer Comac on the development of the C919 
­narrowbody aircraft.
The two companies have inked a memorandum of understanding under which Comac will regularly exchange 
information with IAG concerning the aircraft and incorporate its suggestions into the aicraft's development.
A joint working programme has also been proposed to co­­operate in areas such as technological and operational 
requirements, aircraft standardisation, financing and customer and product services.
More importantly, in line with the agreement Comac signed with Ryanair at last year's Paris air show, IAG will now 
consider the CFM International Leap-1C-powered C919 for its "potential sub-fleet". Though IAG's chief executive 
Willie Walsh says it is "still too early" to say how many of the narrowbodies the carrier could order, it is "carefully 
examining" the aircraft.
"Comac is proving to be a new alternative for IAG to secure the right aircraft at the right price," he adds. First flight 
of the C919 is scheduled for 2014 with entry into service following in 2016.

Ryanair this morning made a formal bid offer for that part of Aer Lingus it doesn't already own for E1.30 per share, 
which would put the total offer at E694m.
The no-frills airline currently owns 29.8pc of Aer Lingus and previously said that the chances of clearing antitrust 
hurdles have been boosted by mergers among other European carriers, falling traffic in Dublin that leaves room for 
new entrants and Irish government plans to auction its own 25pc Aer Lingus stake.
"In six years as a public company, Aer Lingus has failed to deliver value," Ryanair chief executive officer Michael 
O'Leary said in a letter accompanying the bid document, adding that the smaller carrier has incurred cumulative 
losses of E91 million during that period.
Aer Lingus traded 1.4pc higher at E1.07 as of 10:52am in Dublin, where both carriers are based, taking the gain this 
year to 69pc. That's still 23 cents below the offer price and values the carrier at E568 million. Ryanair, which built its 
stake in 2006 and 2007 and is making the new bid via wholly-owned subsidiary Coinside Ltd, was little changed at 
E4.14. The company has a market value of E5.96 billion and has advanced 14pc this year.

"In six years as a public company, Aer Lingus has failed to deliver value," Ryanair chief executive officer Michael 
O'Leary said in a letter accompanying the bid document, adding that the smaller carrier has incurred cumulative 
losses of E91 million during that period.
Aer Lingus traded 1.4pc higher at E1.07 as of 10:52am in Dublin, where both carriers are based, taking the gain this 
year to 69pc. That's still 23 cents below the offer price and values the carrier at E568 million. Ryanair, which built its 
stake in 2006 and 2007 and is making the new bid via wholly-owned subsidiary Coinside Ltd, was little changed at 
E4.14. The company has a market value of E5.96 billion and has advanced 14pc this year.

Exporters today warned of "dire consequences" for the economy if Aer Lingus' airfreight service to US is not 
retained.
At meeting with Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar, the Irish Exporters Association (IEA) advised of the strategic 
importance of the Aer Lingus air cargo facility in meeting the requirements of high tech and life sciences exporters 
to efficiently and competitively reach their markets.
The IEA stated that this issue has not been given sufficient consideration in relation to the Government's decision to 
dispose of its shareholder stake in Aer Lingus.
"The Aer Lingus flights to the USA carry approximately 52pc of the value of our exports and 43pc of all imports from 
the USA. At risk is the E18 billion of pharmaceutical and medical technology that is exported by airfreight to the 
USA and E4.5 billion of high tech imports required for a wide range of manufacturing companies in Ireland. The 
daily airfreight connection to the US has been at the heart of Irish export growth for several decades .Let us not 
forget this is our largest export market as well as our main source of Foreign direct investment .The daily airfreight 
link is a strategic trade corridor for Ireland and must be treated as such, said John Whelan, chief executive of the

across their entire fleet and hence if they procured the dominant stake in Aer Lingus are likely to drop air cargo 
handling .This is not a risk that should be taken with any potential buyer of a majority stake in Aer Lingus". In 
conclusion the IEA strongly recommended that the Government do not dispose of it's remaining shareholding in Aer 
Lingus, as this would immediately put Aer Lingus into play as a takeover target, without any influence by the 
Government in ensuring the critical air cargo service link to the US in particular, is retained. Mr Whelan concluded

Aer Lingus petition to halt latest Ryanair bid is rejected

Body
The Competition Commission in Britain has rebuffed a petition from Aer Lingus aimed at halting Ryanair's latest bid 
for the Irish carrier.
Aer Lingus asked the competition watchdog to stop the bid process until it finished its ongoing investigation into 
Ryanair's existing 29 per cent stake in the airline. However, the request was rejected.
*The Sunday Business Post*has also established that Ryanair asked the Competition Commission to halt its 
investigation into the 29 per cent shareholding while the bid process was ongoing.
Michael O'Leary and Ryanair argued that it was now a matter for the European Commission. Again, the 
commission rejected the request, deciding instead to continue its ongoing investigation.
The British authority announced an investigation into the 29 per cent stake last month, following preliminary work by 
the Office of Fair Trading, which raised questions about Ryanair's ability to weaken Aer Lingus as a competitor as a 
result of its voting power. The engagement by both sides with the British competition watchdog comes as Ryanair 
prepares to lodge its formal bid document for Aer Lingus in the coming days. The document has to be lodged early 
this week.
Aer Lingus will then have two weeks to advise shareholders on the bid.
Given that the board has already said that the bid undervalues the company, it is likely that the airline will submit a 
formal defence against the takeover bid.
Shortly after Ryanair lodged the EUR 1.30-a-share bid, Aer Lingus questioned whether the deal was "capable of 
completion", a reference to the regulatory hurdles Ryanair's offer will face from the European Commission.
The commission has indicated that any examination of a new Ryanair bid would start from scratch, with no 
reference to the rejection of Ryanair's first bid for the Irish carrier in late 2006.

Highlight: European airlines
Carriers are facing losses, writes Andrew Parker 
Body
Being the chief executive of a European airline is an apparently thankless job right now.
The immediate outlook is grim - European airlines are expected to report combined net losses of $1.1bn in 2012, 
principally because of the eurozone crisis, says the International Air Transport Association, the industry's main 
representative body. That compares with a combined profit of $500m last year.
"The eurozone crisis is standing in the way of improved profitability," said Tony Tyler, director-general of Iata, last 
month.
But there are some tentative signs that European airlines are heading towards a more profitable future - and that 
earnings could become more sustainable on a long-term basis.
Significant industry consolidation has been progressing for almost a decade. The latest move came in April, when 
International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways, bought BMI British Midland, in order to strengthen its position 
at London's Heathrow airport .
Amid the EU's sovereign debt crisis, consolidation is being accompanied by a spate of airline failures.
Hungary's Malev, and Barcelona-based Spanair have been the most high profile casualties this year.
This reduction in the number of airlines provides the remaining carriers with the opportunity to curb seating capacity 
growth - or even cut it - and therefore potentially raise fares.
Meanwhile, Europe's three leading flag carriers - Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa - are taking steps to reduce 
costs at underperforming short and medium haul operations.
And all of this comes against a backdrop of some relief from high fuel prices.
Consolidation should improve prospects
Since March, European jet fuel has fallen more than 15 per cent in price to about $940 per tonne. Europe 
undoubtedly has too many airlines - 320 in the 27 EU member states - partly because countries cling to the idea of 
having their own flag carrier.
The problem is arguably exacerbated by large aircraft leasing companies renting jets to airlines that cannot afford to 
buy them.
But it is possible to see the emergence of five large airline groups - Air France-KLM, easyJet, IAG, Lufthansa and 
Ryanair.
easyJet and Ryanair are enjoying the economic downturn, as consumers and business people increasing use the 
budget airlines for European travel in an effort to reduce their spending.
The big question for both carriers is how they tap further growth.
For example, Ryanair is seeking to buy more aircraft because its existing deal with Boeing is coming to an end, but 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive, may find it hard to purchase jets at cheap prices because the manufacturers have 
large order backlogs.
Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa are also finally responding to the competitive -challenge from Ryanair and 
easyJet by seeking cost savings at short and medium-haul operations.
They have laid out ambitious plans to cut staff costs, although it is far from certain that they will succeed because of 
resistance from trade unions.
Andrew Lobbenberg, -analyst at HSBC, said: "We expect union opposition, industrial action and cost creep to erode 
the benefits that are ultimately negotiated. But we do expect progress."
Air France-KLM, which is burdened by high operating costs and a large debt load, last month announced plans to 
cut more than 5,000 staff in France, or 10 per cent of the domestic workforce. In a nod to the new Socialist 
government of President François Hollande - and in an effort to avoid conflict with France's strike-prone unions - Air 
France said it would seek voluntary redundancies.
But it warned that compulsory job losses would be unavoidable if no deal was possible with the unions.
IAG, which is also the parent of Spains' Iberia, last year created a new low-cost carrier in Spain called -Iberia 
Express, where pilots are paid less than their counterparts at the main airline.
The move prompted strikes at Iberia, and last month the company announced that it would mount a legal challenge 
to an arbitrator's ruling that the carrier must include all of its pilots in the same overall pay scale, even if working 
conditions in the two parts of the business are different.
The bright spot for Europe's main flag carriers has been their transatlantic long-haul operations, where they are 
benefiting from the quasi-consolidation that stems from them forming joint ventures with US airlines over the past 
decade.
Christoph Franz, chief executive of Lufthansa, said in May: "We do feel that this is bringing more rationality in the 
development of capacity and pricing."
One of Mr Franz's key concerns is the competitive threat posed by the three fast-growing Gulf carriers - Emirates, 
Etihad and Qatar Airways.
There is little sign of the threat diminishing, although it could reduce as the Gulf carriers enter code-sharing 
agreements with European airlines.
Meanwhile, Europe is expecting more consolidation between carriers.
Consolidation should improve prospects
TAP Portugal, the Portuguese flag carrier, is due to be privatised this year, and could attract interest from Lufthansa 
and IAG.
One closely watched move will be Ryanair's third takeover bid for Aer Lingus , the Irish flag carrier, which was 
launched last month.
The two previous bids failed after objections by European competition authorities, and it is likely that the European 
Commission will also have objections to Ryanair's latest offer for Aer Lingus, which -values the carrier's equity at 
EUR694m.
But this time around the Irish government may look more favourably at -Ryanair's bid because, under the terms of 
the country's bailout by the EU and the International -Monetary Fund, it wants to sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus.
The dilemma therefore for the competition authorities is whether - knowing Europe has too many airlines - they 
should block Ryanair's third bid.

Waterford pilot college to seek bankruptcy protection this week
Waterford pilot college to seek bankruptcy protection this week

The Irish pilot-training firm at the centre of a financial row that has left trainee pilots stranded in Florida is poised to 
seek bankruptcy protection from its creditors in the coming days.
Waterford-based Pilot Training College (PTC) is working with its financial advisers this weekend on a rescue plan 
for the business. It is expected the firm make a petition to the High Court in Dublin later this week, or early next 
week, for the appointment of an examiner to the business.
If examinership is sanctioned, the move would provide the company 100 days to get its finances in order, by 
negotiating with creditors. The company is also working this weekend to source alternative training facilities for its 
80 students, 36 of them Irish, in Florida, who have had their courses suspended.
More details have started to emerge about the company this weekend. *The Sunday Business Post has also 
learned that the British Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints against PTC in 2010 over 
"misleading" claims it made to attract prospective trainee pilots to its EUR 100,000 courses.*
The ASA said a Pilot Training College (PTC) advertisement breached codes relating to "substantiation" and 
"truthfulness", saying they should not appear again. The complaints to the ASA centred around an advertorial in an 
aviation magazine that claimed PTC was one of the leading suppliers of commercial pilots to major airlines like 
Emirates, Flybe, Virgin, Qantas and Ryanair.
The ASA ruled this claim was misleading and said that PTC had acknowledged it was inaccurate. The ASA also 
ruled as misleading a claim that training to become an airline pilot would cost less than one year's salary for a 
captain, "which is a level reached by most graduates within five years of graduation".
The standards authority ruling was delivered in October 2010, just months after Enterprise Ireland made an 
investment of over EUR 440,000 in the company. An Enterprise Ireland spokeswoman could not comment on 
whether the state agency was aware of the adjudication against PTC at the time or if it followed up the issue with 
the company.
Waterford pilot college to seek bankruptcy protection this week
Enterprise Ireland has no involvement in the day-to-day running of the business and a preference shareholding 
affords no voting rights in a company.
Meanwhile, financial statements for the year 2010 for PTC's parent company, Shemburn Limited, stated that the 
company was involved in a legal case in the Netherlands with a former contractor. The contractor was claiming 
EUR 133,329 in respect of unpaid leasing charges of two aircraft and EUR 28,056 in respect of unpaid invoices for 
replacement engines.
Shemburn had lodged a counterclaim for EUR 117,562 in damages for breach of contract against the contractor 
and a decision from the court was expected within the year, the accounts stated.
It has also emerged that the US-based portion of PTC has secured a $2 million tax concession as part of a plan to 
construct a pilot training facility of its own adjacent to the lands where it was currently renting a trainee airbase.
A spokesman for Brevard County, the local municipal authority where PTC Florida was based, said that the local 
county's commissioners had recently approved a $2 million incentive package contingent on PTC investing in the 
development and creating more than 200 new jobs.
The company would be entitled to write $200,000 off its annual tax bill every year for the next decade under the 
plan, but it can only access this concession if it proceeds with the development.
Brevard's county manager, Howard Tipton, told The Sunday Business Post that the authority "stands ready to 
honour its tax incentive commitment if these issues can be resolved".

Ryanair will include debit card charges in overall price of tickets (Reuters)
Twelve budget airlines have agreed to include debit card charges previously hidden till the last minute of a 
transaction in their headline prices rather than have them appear at the end of the booking process.
The companies - including Ryanair and easyJet - agreed to absorb debit card surcharges and will make credit card 
surcharges more transparent in the headline figure following an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading after 
complaints from consumer body Which?
Aer Lingus, BMI Baby, Eastern Airways, Flybe, German Wings, Jet2, Lufthansa, Thomas Cook, Thomson and Wizz 
Air have also agreed to the changes.
The government has considered making all airline carriers follow suit.
The £6 administration fee charged by Ryanair - which can sometimes hike by a third the price of a ticket at the low-
cost airline - will be included in the advertised headline rate by 1 August.
Eastern Airways, easyJet, Flybe, German Wings, Lufthansa, Thomas Cook, Thomson (TUI) and Wizz Air have 
already made changes to their pricing structure.
The investigation by the OFT was launched after Which? magazine launched what they described as a 'super-
complaint' against airline companies who incorporate "rip-off" card surcharges in March.
The hidden charges are estimated to cost passengers more than £300m a year.
The UK Treasury had previously planned to crack down on "excessive" credit and debit card surcharges and hopes 
to have the practice stamped out by the end of 2012.
Ryanair and Easyjet Include Debit Card Surcharges in Headline Air Ticket Price
Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith said: "Over 50,000 people supported our campaign to end rip-off 
surcharges so it's good news that debit card surcharges will be displayed in the headline price of flights - as long as 
the airlines don't use this as an excuse to push up their prices.
"It's also important that credit card charges are clearly displayed throughout the booking process and the OFT 
should make sure that all companies are taking these steps, not just airlines.
"We're pleased that the government has said they are sticking to their original timetable to ban excessive card 
surcharges by the end of the year."
Clive Maxwell, the OFT's chief executive, said: "This is a great outcome for the millions of people who buy flights 
online. It is important that the cost presented when they search for a flight is realistic and that they are not surprised 
by extra charges. Otherwise, it is harder for them to shop around for the best deal."
When the investigation was launched Ryanair spokesman Stephen McNamara released a less than dignified 
response:
He said: "Before making super-duper complaints the clueless clowns at Which, Who or What magazine should 
conduct some basic research.
"Ryanair does not levy any credit or debit card payment 'surcharges'. Even our administration fee is avoidable by 
passengers who use our recommended MasterCard Prepaid.
"If it wasn't for dentist waiting rooms or doctors' surgeries it is doubtful whether anyone even reads the useless and 
frequently inaccurate Which, Who or What magazine."
Ticketing agencies for bands and shows are known as one of the more prime offenders for card surcharges. 
Ticketmaster's hidden charges include an "order processing fee" on top of a traditional service charge, which vastly 
increase the overall price from the headline price.

AIRLINES are to ditch hidden debit card fees next month following an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT).
Twelve companies including Ryanair and Thomas Cook have pledged to declare any extra debit card charges in 
the headline price of a ticket, abolishing the practice of imposing surprise fees at the end of online transactions.
And the OFT said the firms will make surcharges for credit cards more transparent, after the watchdog spent more 
than a year investigating consumer complaints about such fees.
"It is important that the cost presented when they search for a flight is realistic and that they are not surprised by 
extra charges," said new OFT chief executive Clive Maxwell.
"We made it clear from the start that we would use all of our enforcement powers, including court action if 
necessary, but are pleased to have reached agreement with the airlines before court proceedings were required."
He added that a number of firms including EasyJet, Flybe and Thomson have already made changes to their online 
booking systems, with others set to follow from 1 August.
Ryanair said yesterday it was "pleased to have resolved this issue with the OFT and even with this inclusion, we'll 
continue to offer the lowest fares to our passengers".
The government has announced plans to bring forward new laws that will ban excessive credit and debit card fees 
across all transactions.

EASYJET carried almost a tenth more passengers in June compared to a year ago, figures out yesterday showed.
The low-cost airline said it took 5.43m passengers last month, up 9.7 per cent on June 2011, while its load factor, a 
measure of how full its flights are, jumped 1.6 percentage points to 89.9 per cent.
In the year to the end of June, EasyJet carried 57.37m passengers on its budget flights around Europe, the Middle 
East and North Africa. This figure is up 7.5 per cent on the previous year.
Meanwhile Irish carrier Aer Lingus reported a two per cent rise in passenger numbers in June, with 918,000 
customers travelling on its flights last month.
The firm, which is entangled in a takeover bid from Ryanair, said long-haul traffic jumped 12.5 per cent on a year 
ago, to 99,000, while short-haul traffic ticked up 0.1 per cent to 819,000.
Aer Lingus' load factor increased by 3.8 percentage points on a year ago to 82.6 per cent.
The company has said an offer from Ryanair that values it at (EURO)694m is not lucrative enough.

The ISEQ slipped in to negative territory today with investors underwhelmed by comments from ECB chief, Mario 
Draghi and amid dashed hopes of impending initiatives from the central bank to drive the eurozone economy 
forward.
The index fell 3.72 points to 3,214.67.
European shares slipped from two-month highs to end slightly lower as a slew of expected positive measures by 
central banks to boost growth prompted investors to book profits, while encouraging data dimmed chances of more 
U.S. stimulus. Disappointing comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi about the economic 
outlook and a lack of hints that more easy money was on the way also weighed, with bond yields in both Spain and 
Italy rising and their share indexes slumping 3.2 percent and 2 percent, respectively.
EasyJet has released (July 5th) its June traffic statistics. IAG released its June traffic numbers yesterday. EasyJet 
saw load factor increase to 89.9pc, up 1.6pp versus June 2011. Passenger numbers increased by 9.7pc to 
5,434,763. IAG meanwhile saw demand (revenue passenger kilometres) rise by 8.9pc versus June 2011, up 5.9pc 
on a like-for-like basis, while capacity (available seat kilometres) was up 5.8pc, +2.6pc on a like-for-like basis. Load 
factor therefore increased by 2.3pt, 2.6pt on a like-for-like basis, to 84pc. Shares in Ryanair rose 6c to E4.08 and 
Aer Lingus stocks gained 4c to E1.08 after it delivered healthy June passenger growth and load factor numbers. On 
July 4th, Dragon Oil announced an initial flow rate o f 2,918 bopd from the third development well drilled from its 
new platform C, offshore Turkmenistan. "This rate exceeds our assumption of an average initial flow rate of 2,500 
bopd from a development well. The first and second wells drilled from platform C flowed at 3,396 and 2,072 bopd 
respectively. Platform C is located in the western flank of the LAM field offshore Turkmenistan. This is a relatively 
undepleted part of the LAM field," according to Davy. Shares in the prospector climbed 3c to E7.16. Betfair 
ISEQ dips, underwhelmed by Draghi ISEQ Dips
announced yesterday that it has reached agreement with the Horseracing industry (British Horseracing Authority 
(BHA), Racecourse Association and the Horseman's Group) in relation to a new five year commercial agreement. 
As part of the agreement Betfair has agreed to pay at least £40m to horseracing over the next five years. To recap, 
Betfair already pays 10.75pc of all its revenues on UK horseracing from UK customers since it moved offshore last 
year. This new agreement should not lead to a significant increase in costs, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers in 
Dublin. Shares in Irish bookies, Paddy Power, climbed 8c to E53.08. Among the smaller caps, shares in Petroceltic 
edged up 1c to E0.10. Petroceltic has been awarded two licences offshore Italy. The B.R 270 and B.R 271 licences 
are in the central Adriatic and cover a cumulative area of 470 sq km. The exploration licences run for six years. 
Petroceltic has 100pc of each, although a 2010 farm-out agreement allows Orca the option to earn a 15pc interest 
in the permits.

European shares rose, reigniting a recent strong rally as investors awaited policy action from the European Central

points to a record low of 0.75 percent, though the market reaction is likely to be muted. "If we get a (25 basis point 
cut) we could get a pretty modest reaction to it if that's what's expected. I think though it helps in terms of the more 
positive newsflow that we're starting to see on Europe - the summit was an upside surprise, expectations were 
pretty low going into that," Robert Parkes, equity strategist at HSBC Securities, said.
EasyJet has released (July 5th) its June traffic statistics. IAG released its June traffic numbers yesterday. EasyJet 
saw load factor increase to 89.9pc, up 1.6pp versus June 2011. Passenger numbers increased by 9.7pc to 
5,434,763. IAG meanwhile saw demand (revenue passenger kilometres) rise by 8.9pc versus June 2011, up 5.9pc 
on a like-for-like basis, while capacity (available seat kilometres) was up 5.8pc, +2.6pc on a like-for-like basis. Load 
factor therefore increased by 2.3pt, 2.6pt on a like-for-like basis, to 84pc. Shares in Ryanair rose 7c to E4.08 and 
Aer Lingus stocks gained 3c to E1.07. On July 4th, Dragon Oil announced an initial flow rate o f 2,918 bopd from 
the third development well drilled from its new platform C, offshore Turkmenistan. "This rate exceeds our 
assumption of an average initial flow rate of 2,500 bopd from a development well. The first and second wells drilled 
from platform C flowed at 3,396 and 2,072 bopd respectively. Platform C is located in the western flank of the LAM 
field offshore Turkmenistan. This is a relatively undepleted part of the LAM field," according to Davy. Shares in the 
prospector climbed 5c to E7.18.

Etihad Airways is not willing to sell its 3 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, raising fresh doubts over Ryanair's takeover 
bid for the Irish flag carrier.
James Hogan, chief executive of the Gulf airline, said yesterday that Etihad was backing Aer Lingus's management 
and its strategy. "We are not selling," he said.
Ryanair launched its third takeover bid in six years for Aer Lingus last month, offering EUR1.30 per share, which 
values the carrier's equity at EUR694m.
Aer Lingus responded by saying that the bid undervalued the company, and told shareholders to take no action 
over the offer.
Etihad announced in May that it had bought a 2.99 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and Mr Hogan confirmed yesterday 
that it was interested in the possibility of purchasing the Irish government's 25 per cent stake in the carrier.
"Our equity investments are strategic and long term," he said. "We have invested due to our view of the Aer Lingus 
business model and the success the management are having implementing that model. We continue to support that 
management team."
Mr Hogan said Etihad had not held discussions with Ryanair, which stated last month that it was prepared to work 
with the Gulf carrier if it bought the government's stake in Aer Lingus.
Instead, Mr Hogan said Etihad and Aer Lingus were in talks about the possibility of a code-sharing agreement. 
Ryanair could not be reached for comment.
Foreign ownership rules almost certainly prevent Etihad from buying a controlling stake in Aer Lingus or another EU 
airline.

Analysts said last month that Ryanair's latest take-over bid for Aer Lingus could be blocked by the European 
Commission, which objected to the first offer made in 2006.
Etihad backing for Aer Lingus raises doubts on Ryanair bid
The Irish government last month expressed concerns about antitrust issues associated with Ryanair's bid, although 
it stressed it did not have a veto. The government is planning to sell its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus under the 
terms of Ireland's bailout agreement with the EU and the International Monetary Fund.
Foreign ownership rules almost certainly prevent Etihad from buying a controlling stake in Aer Lingus or another EU 
airline.
However, Etihad in December agreed to buy a 29 per cent stake in Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest airline.
Through commercial partnerships with the carriers in which it has bought minority stakes, Etihad is seeking to 
secure additional passengers for its long-haul operations. Mr Hogan said Etihad was holding talks with Air France-
KLM about the possibility of a code-sharing agreement.

BRITISH Airlines owner IAG reported a six per cent jump in like-for-like passengers numbers for June yesterday. 
But the firm, which is running an advertising campaign urging Britons to stay in the country during the Olympics, 
repeated its forecast that the Games will dampen premium traffic figures during the summer.
IAG said it carried 5.05m passengers in June, up 11.6 per cent, or 6.1 per cent once it strips out the boost from new 
routes introduced during the year.
Measured in revenue passenger kilometres, traffic rose by an underlying 5.9 per cent.
Group premium traffic grew by 5.3 per cent compared to the previous year, with 9.6 per cent growth in nonpremium 
traffic.
Custom from domestic passengers, which includes Brits and Spanish flyers using sister firm Iberia, rose 25.4 per 
cent on a year ago to 1.16m thanks in part to new routes from Madrid and the acquisition of BMI.
Iberia reported an overall 3.2 per cent rise in revenue passenger kilometres to 4.47bn, while British Airways fared 
even better with a 7.1 per cent like-for-like rise to 11.31bn.
But the group's cargo operations continued to experience weakness, with cargo tonnes carried falling an underlying 
0.6 per cent to 507m kilometres last month. The fall widens to 2.3 per cent in the year to June.
IAG's overall load factor, a measure of how full its flights are, rose an underlying one percentage point to 76.1 per 
cent.

•Budget carrier Ryanair has reported a 6.3 per cent jump in passenger numbers in June compared to a year ago.

Highlight: Online flight search company Skyscanner has taken a considered approach to growth, writes Ian Wylie
Body
Gareth Williams looks every inch the web entrepreneur: black shirt, jeans and enviable tan. Skyscanner's offices 
tick all the dotcom boxes too: prime location, wall-to-wall natural wood and smoked glass, video-game zone and a 
kitchen chock-full of free fruit and drinks.
Except this is Edinburgh's Princes Street, not Silicon Valley. And Skyscanner, the online flight search company Mr 
Williams co-founded just as the last dotcom bubble burst, has climbed to the number-two spot in its sector through 
careful and cautious growth, not boosterish hype. It now has 20m unique visitors a month, who together spend 
more than £2bn a year. "I remember when we boasted that everyone who used our site could fill the Albert Hall," he 
says. "Now the numbers are getting scary."
The business Mr Williams hatched in a London pub with two student friends has travelled a very different and more 
measured route from its main rival, Connecticut-based Kayak . While Skyscanner spent seven years building its 
model before seeking a first round of venture capital funding - £2.5m from Scottish Equity Partners (SEP) - market 
leader Kayak, which was founded three years later, has raised more than $220m, splashing the cash on acquiring 
competitors and paying Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey to narrate its ads on primetime television in the US. It is 
thought to be planning an initial public offering once the Facebook storm quells. But don't mistake Skyscanner's 
more considered approach for shiftlessness. "We don't want to stop at being the most successful flight search 
engine in Edinburgh," says Mr Williams. His goal is to make the business Scotland's first billion-dollar web 
company.
Skyscanner is a vertical search engine - one that provides answers for one specific topic - storing all flight data on 
its own servers. Yet search results are delivered in less than a second.
"The model allows us to present data how we choose," he says, meaning the company can tailor results to 
individual consumers' requirements.
A carefully managed take-off
We might have been discussing online pub jukeboxes, another idea on the table that lager-fuelled evening when 
the three friends - all freelance programmers - cast their votes. But Bonamy Grimes and Barry Smith were won over 
by Mr Williams' passion for the Excel spreadsheet he had created to help find the cheapest fare to French ski 
resorts. The trio agreed that Messrs Smith and Grimes would continue their contract work but share their salaries 
so Mr Williams could develop the site full-time.
"I'd got tired of not putting my all into something," says Mr Williams of his time as a freelance IT contractor. "Budget 
airlines like easyJet, Ryanair, Go and Buzz were starting up, but there was no way of comparing prices or 
discovering new routes that had just opened."
Mr Williams programmed a tool that extracted data from the airlines' programs to collect the routes and prices for 
his spreadsheet.
They had little idea where to find revenues, but Mr Williams recalls 14-hour days spent coding, convinced that if he 
found it useful, others would too. "We've always had faith that as long as we keep building stuff that would make our 
travelling easier, then we will grow our users. We didn't have friends or family investment, so we could really 
concentrate on user benefits, without investors' interests diverting us."
In fact, BMI, rather than a budget airline, became the first airline to agree to pay a referral fee followed by British 
Airways. "That was down to Barry's emerging skills of business development and his persistence in explaining how 
much cheaper it was to get a sale through Skyscanner," says Mr Williams.
Still, it took two years to reach £100 a day in revenue, and another two years to ring up £1,000 a day.
By 2005, all three founders were working on Skyscanner full-time. Mr Williams had moved to Edinburgh with his 
Scottish wife, and persuaded the other two to join him. By 2007, they had 15 employees, but had neither the 
experience nor resources to extend the service beyond flights originating in the UK.
According to Mr Williams, it's easy to attract talent to a city as beautiful, and cosmopolitan as Edinburgh despite its 
relatively remote location. "The biggest challenge, is that we don't have a Twitter next door - a company that is 
showing truly world class growth and global presence. That means the ambition we have for our own growth has to 
be built from the inside out," he says.
The £2.5m cash injection from SEP enabled them to do both. Since then, website traffic and revenues have 
increased tenfold and the team has expanded to 150 people representing 30 nationalities. The site, which turns 
over £30m a year, is in 29 different languages and visitors outside the UK now account for more than 75 per cent of 
traffic.
The company, which turned its first profit in 2009, has opened a fullservice office in Singapore, is about to open a 
smaller one in Beijing and plans another in the Americas next year. The funding enabled Skyscanner to hire senior 
executives with experience of running a fast-growing company, but also forced the three founders to decide on a 
chief executive. "None of us had titles, but one of us had to be CEO," says Mr Williams. "I wanted to be CTO but 
didn't want some idiot telling me what to do. So I became the idiot.
"The investment has brought more formality but we've learnt that we have to formalise certain things in order not to 
lose them."
Skyscanner launched an app last year, and mobile users now represents a third of traffic. The tech team, which 
accounts for half the workforce, is now developing voice-activated search functionality for the app.
Mr Williams is keen to push beyond flight search, giving users prices for rail, car hire, hotels, holiday packages, 
cruises, travel insurance and airport parking.
Meanwhile, Google has launched its own hotel and flight search tools and services and Microsoft's Bing Travel 
wants a slice of the pie as well. "We have to respect them all," admits Mr Williams, "but ultimately it comes down to 
our appetite as a company."
A carefully managed take-off
Skyscanner has not ruled out a stock market listing, but Mr Williams says he is happy to leave that decision to his 
board.
He does, however, still occasionally hanker for his pre-CEO days. "I miss coding, to be honest, but I do love the 
different challenges that arise as we get bigger."
How to reach for the skies 
Gareth Wiliams' tips on getting ahead.
 Share, don't protect. "An idea on its own is not worth a great deal. The concept of joint, equal control and stakes 
in the company was for the long-term benefit of Skyscanner."
 Pace yourselves  "Sometimes I wonder what might have happened had we taken investment earlier, but we 
wanted to build the business at a rate which worked for us."
 Use your bootstraps "Every entrepreneur is different, but I am a fan of bootstrapping a company. The fact that 
web companies can be started and run for £5,000 is a really powerful and democratising thing. You don't need a 
Silicon Valley big-noise start."

Highlight: Low cost carrier mandates banks for novel ECA financing structure.
Body
Ryanair has mandated BNP Paribas and Citi to arrange a $220 million US Ex-Im backed financing to fund the 
delivery of seven 737s.
The deal, which will have a 12-year tenor, will be one of the earliest deals to take advantage of new rules allowing 
US Ex-Im to guarantee pre-funded bonds. Airfinance Journal understands that the deal is expected to price in 
August.
Traditionally ECAs have only guaranteed bonds that refinance banks loans to fund aircraft deliveries as it was 
deemed too difficult to coordinate an exact aircraft delivery with a capital market closing.
Industry sources state that the new pre-funding options gives airlines greater flexibility to choose when they 
approach the capital markets, and lock in a better margin rate.
Aviation bankers have been bullish about using the bond market to offload deals. At present aircraft delivery bonds, 
backed by US Ex-Im deals have been closing at or below a 2.00% coupon rate since February. Bankers state there 
remains plenty of appetite for these types of deals.
"It is government paper so you will always find some investors willing to do it but it is more a question of pricing. 
Right now we have been lucky but it could change. The gap between bond pricing and bank pricing however is 
narrowing and there is little more than 20/ 30bps between the two", states one aviation financier.

Body
Cargolux expects to take delivery of its fifth 747-8 in late August. The aircraft will be financed via a US Ex-Im 
guaranteed loan. Pefco will act as lender.
The first four 747-8 deliveries to Cargolux were also financed under a US Ex-Im guaranteed loan. JP Morgan is 
acting as lender or part lender on the four aircraft. The financing is worth over $600 million.
The carrier became the launch customer for the 747-8F when it ordered the aircraft in 2005, and has 13 747-8Fs on 
order. Nord LB is providing pre-delivery payment (PDP) financing for the first six aircraft.
US Ex-Im bond
Cargolux is also due to take its sixth 747-8 in October. Airfinance Journal understands that Cargolux is considering 
financing this sixth freighter with a US Ex-Im bond because of the attractive pricing the structure offers. Banks are 
being approached to finance the aircraft. Other structures are still being considered by Cargolux.
Recently there has been a spate of US Ex-Im bonds. Ryanair has mandated a pre-funded US Ex-Im bond, one of 
the earliest deals announced for this novel structure.
Emirates Airlines has also closed two US Ex-Im-backed bonds worth a total of $509.578 million to refinance the 
delivery of four 777-300 ERs. The bond has the lowest coupon rate for any aircraft deal at 1.5%.
Lion Air has also issued a US Ex-Im Bank guaranteed $138 million 10-year bond, as have Air China,
Financiers tell Airfinance Journal that the low pricing export credit agency (ECA) guaranteed bonds offer are 
encouraging good credits to consider financing aircraft this way.jbullen@euromoneyplc.com

Highlight: The airline blames fuel cost for the fall.
Body
Low cost carrier Ryanair reported a profit of Eu99 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, 29% down from the 
same period a year ago. The airline's chief executive Michael O'Leary says high fuel cost has caused the Eu40 
million fall. Last year Ryanair reported Eu139 million Q1 profit.
Ryanair says unit costs rose 10% mainly due to a 27% (Eu117 million) increase in fuel costs. Other factors that 
have dampened the Q1 yield increase quoted are the EU recession, austerity measures, and heavily discounted 
fares at the carrier's new base launches in Cyprus, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Provincial UK and Spain.
Revenue increased 11% to Eu1.284 million and traffic grew 6%. The airline is 90% hedged for FY13 at 
approximately $1000 pt, up 21% on last year's price.

Aer Lingus says the offer represents a discount of 31% to Aer Lingus' gross cash per share of Eu1.87 and a 
discount of 17% to the net asset value per share of Eu1.56.
Ryanair made its third offer to the Irish flag carrier about a month ago. The low-cost carrier submitted its bid 
yesterday. The offer is for Eu 1.30 per share in cash, which values Aer Lingus at 694 million euros. Ryanair 
presently has a 30% stake in Aer Lingus. It launched two unsuccessful bids in 2006 and 2008, which the European 
Commission blocked because of its potential effect on UK customers and aviation competition.
In its response to the latest bid, Aer Lingus' board points out that the European commission is likely to once again 
prohibit Ryanair's offer. The board also says the reasons for prohibition are now even stronger than before as the 
number of routes Ryanair would monopolise has sharply increased.

Aer Lingus has published a 30 page circular to its shareholders explaining its reasons for rejecting Ryanair's latest

The paper begins with the call "Reject Ryanair's offer. Do not complete any form of acceptance." The circular 
includes a letter from Aer Lingus chairman Colm Barrington.
Among the reasons for rejecting the offer, Aer Lings says that it is not in the interests of its shareholders. The Irish 
carrier also says it is a strong and profitable business and that Ryanair's offer fundamentally undervalues Aer 
Lingus.

Little about Ryanair should surprise us. This is the airline whose irrepressible chief executive, Michael O'Leary, 
once opined that "the customer is usually wrong". True to form, the statement that accompanied the budget airline's 
June 19 cash offer for rival Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, contained a memorably impudent flourish.
The Irish government, which owns a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, stands to realise EUR174m if the acquisition 
goes ahead on Ryanair's terms at EUR1.30 a share, plus another EUR4m from an Aer Lingus dividend.
"This," Ryanair observed sententiously, "is clearly beneficial in the context of the current recessionary environment 
and will make a valuable contribution towards budget spending in such important areas as health and education." 
Since when, one might ask, have airlines been advising governments how to raise money for social expenditure?
The statement was a naked attempt to exploit the government's sense of financial vulnerability after Ireland's 
multibillion-euro rescue by its European partners and the International Monetary Fund. Mr O'Leary might as well 
have put all pretence aside and told the government: "You're stony broke. I'm in the money. Sell up now.
From a different perspective, the statement's underlying purpose was to throw up a smokescreen to obscure the 
serious competition issues that surround Ryanair's bid. Europe's biggest low-fare carrier amassed a 29.8 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus after the airline's 2006 privatisation.
But that year European Union competition regulators prevented Ryanair from taking full control and now the UK's 
competition commission is investigating the market impact of Ryanair's holding.
It is also misleading to dismiss Aer Lingus, as Ryanair does, as "a small and uncompetitive airline" that is "overly 
dependent on a deteriorating Irish economy".
Such assertions sit oddly next to Ryanair's own acknowledgment that Aer Lingus made a EUR84.4m pre-tax profit 
in 2011. Moreover, Aer Lingus recorded higher revenues, passenger numbers and total yield per passenger last 
year on both long-haul and short-haul flights. At year's end, it had EUR895m in gross cash on its balance sheet.
Ryanair seeks uplift from Europe's airline turbulence
Undeniably, the European airline industry is experiencing severe turbulence. Air France, the French unit of Air 
France-KLM, says it must shed more than 5,000 jobs, or about 10 per cent of its workforce, by the end of next year. 
Malev and Spanair, the Hungarian and Catalan carriers, have gone belly up. More consolidation is necessary and 
probably not far away. But Aer Lingus does not deserve to be caricatured as a zombie airline.
The competition concerns centre on the shared domination exerted by Aer Lingus and Ryanair over the Irish 
market. According to the Dublin airport authority, the two airlines had a combined 73 per cent of traffic there in 2007 
but four years later it had risen to 80 per cent.
This level of market concentration is hardly surprising for a small island nation on the edge of a densely populated 
continent. But they do at least ensure a reasonable degree of competition between Aer Lingus and Ryanair, 
keeping prices down for passengers. Unless the newly combined airline were to give up a substantial number of 
routes to new competitors, a merger would put this in jeopardy.
Here a paradox comes into play. A recession-driven downturn in traffic at Dublin airport is increasing the availability 
of operating slots. But few airlines will be interested in acquiring these slots if recession means there are not 
enough passengers to justify the cost.
This is Mr O'Leary's chance. In his eyes, the dark macroeconomic backdrop is one of two good reasons for reviving 
his pursuit of Aer Lingus. The second is the slow but steady reconfiguration of the European airline sector.
For example, International Airlines Group, which unites British Airways with Spain's Iberia, has acquired BMI from 
Lufthansa, a step that may discourage new entrants from installing themselves at London's Heathrow airport. If 
British Airways can strengthen itself in such a fashion, why should Ryanair be deprived of the same opportunity?
Of course, Europe's regulators may not see matters this way. But Mr O'Leary has nothing to lose by testing the 
waters. At worst, he drives up the Aer Lingus share price and smokes out potential bidders such as Etihad Airways, 
the Abu Dhabi-based carrier. At best, he bags the elephant.

Briefing
hydraulic failure hits jetblue a320
safety US investigators are gathering data on a post-departure hydraulics failure that kept a JetBlue Airbus A320 
(N522JB) in a holding pattern near Las Vegas for nearly four hours on 17 June. On climb-out, the pilots alerted air 
traffic controllers of problems, including issues with the hydraulics system. The pilots later declared an emergency, 
telling controllers they had "lost two hydraulic systems" and would need to stay in a holding pattern close to the 
airport for more than 30min to burn off enough of the 16,800kg (37,000lb) fuel load to land within normal weight 
limits. JetBlue says the pilots declared the emergency "due to the loss of one hydraulic system", adding that 
N552JB landed safely nearly four hours after take-off.
icao seals safety pact with airport group
operations Airport safety has potentially received a boost with the signing of a pact between the ICAO and Airports 
Council International to formalise co-operation between the two. Effectively this is an endorsement of ACI's APEX 
(excellence in airport safety) mutual-help programme, but ICAO's weight lends it greater prominence, putting 
pressure on non-participating airports to sign up. Roberto Kobeh González, president of the ICAO council, said the 
memorandum was not simply a piece of paper, but an "action-oriented" measure.
ryanair bids a third time for aer lingus
airlines Irish budget carrier Ryanair is making a third attempt to acquire flag carrier Aer Lingus, just as its minority 
29.8% share is referred to the UK's competition regulator. Ryanair, which could be forced to sell its shareholding, is 
nevertheless offering E1.30 ($1.63) per share for the entire Aer Lingus share capital, even though the European 
Commission has twice blocked similar takeover bids by the low-fare operator. Chief executive Michael O'Leary 
promises to delineate the two carriers, but adds: "By lowering Aer Lingus's unit costs and fares, growing its 
business at some of Europe's major airports and competing with high-fare incumbents, Ryanair can significantly 
increase Aer Lingus's profitability."

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd., a passenger airline, has announced a Maltese High Court's ruling which confirmed that 
Ryanair's terms and conditions in relation to damaged bag claims comply with the Montreal Convention and again 
dismissed bag damage claims made by the Gasan Mamo insurance company.
Body
Gasan Mamo had made claims against Ryanair for damaged bags, which did not meet the criteria set out in 
Ryanair's terms and conditions, which included the time limits specified under the Montreal Convention. These are 
agreed to by all Ryanair passengers at the time of booking. The insurance company claimed that Ryanair's terms 
and conditions were more onerous than the Montreal Convention and that the Convention limits should prevail. The 
Maltese High Court rejected this appeal and confirmed that Ryanair complied with the Montreal Convention and 
dismissed Gasan Mamo's claims. Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "We welcome the ruling by the Maltese 
Courts which confirms that Ryanair's terms and conditions comply with the Montreal Convention and means that we 
will no longer suffer baseless bag damage claims from Gasan Mamo."

Highlight: Ryanair Ltd., a passenger airline, has announced that a Frankfurt Court ruling has obliged 
screenscrapers, who sell Ryanair flights, to fully disclose their intermediary fees and charges, which must now be 
displayed at the start of the booking process to all consumers.
Body
The Frankfurt Courts ruled that Unister, which sells Ryanair flights (on websites such as www.fluege.de and            
www.ab-in-den-urlaub.de) without Ryanair's permission, must now disclose its E14.93 handling fee (which it 
imposes per person on all Ryanair fares) to all its customers. This ruling will now ensure that consumers who book 
through screenscrapers will be made aware of Unister's E14.93 per passenger fee. Ryanair called on German 
consumer agencies to apply this ruling against all other screenscrapers who often hide these intermediary fees. 
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said: "We welcome this Frankfurt Court ruling which confirms that screenscraping 
websites can no longer hide and must in future disclose their intermediary fees. Ryanair has campaigned against 
these screenscrapers for some time and we hope that this Court victory will bring about transparent pricing among 
screenscrapers in the interests of consumers. We call on German consumer agencies, in particular the 
Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband (VZBV), to now ensure that all other screenscrapers comply with this High 
Court ruling and fully disclose these intermediary fees."

Aer Lingus bid: Third time lucky

It's March 1988 and the fledgling Ryanair has just launched flights from Dublin to Manchester in a direct assault on 
the supremacy of Aer Lingus. The state airline used to be allowed to fly from British airports to other parts of Europe 
in the 1950s, but the British government scuppered that real growth potential in 1972. If Aer Lingus got permission 
once again, the Manchester base could be worth a fortune.
So Aer Lingus wants to swat its new rival. Ryanair comes in charging £78 return with a view to increasing to £98 a 
month later. Aer Lingus had been charging £204. A bloodbath follows. Tony Ryan's plans to make £1 million on the 
Manchester route are in tatters and Ryan has to re-finance the airline because of losses.
Such was the power of Aer Lingus back then that it could put up a fight and prompt a Ryanair re-financing. Fast-
forward to 2006 and Ryanair's first bid to buy Aer Lingus. Ryanair has a 70 to 80 per cent market share of the 
Dublin-Manchester route, while Aer Lingus has 20 to 30 per cent. Ryanair has secured a multi-billion euro business 
by flying from places like Manchester to other countries and destinations. Aer Lingus still only flies into and out of 
Ireland.
The tables have been turned even more dramatically since 2006, as Ryanair's market capitalisation is now ten 
times that of Aer Lingus and it carries nearly ten times the number of passengers.
It is ironic that when Ryanair offered EUR 2.80 per share in a EUR 1.48 billion surprise bid for Aer Lingus in 2006, 
John Sharman, then chairman of Aer Lingus, said it undervalued the airline. Last week, when Ryanair offered EUR 
1.30 per share, Aer Lingus said the same thing.
This is Michael O'Leary's third offer for Aer Lingus and it has prompted all kinds of speculation about why he is 
making the bid right now.
We can only speculate about the motivation for a third attempt at a bid that is still unlikely to go ahead.
Aer Lingus bid: Third time lucky
Ryanair is driven by profit. This has been a huge part of its successful formula. O'Leary will make all kinds of 
promises about all kinds of things but, as he once said: "There is no principle that can't be overturned for 
competitive reasons." He made the remark after doing a U-turn on setting up a new hub in Dublin in 2005 after 
promising he never would.
So, would a bolt-on acquisition of a company one tenth its size make that much difference to Ryanair? Absolutely. 
Ryanair may have over 1,500 flight departures per day to 168 airports, but its Dublin business remains very 
important.
Ryanair does not disclose figures on how much money it makes from Irish flights, but it used to disclose its top ten 
routes. For 2009, the last published figures, six of its top ten routes were from Dublin. The Dublin-London route is 
still the busiest international city pair in Europe with 3.7 million passengers on it last year. It's in the top five city 
pairs in the world.
Figures compiled by airline website Anna Aero last week said that, of the 66 European destinations that Aer Lingus 
served from Dublin this summer, 22 already face direct (same airport) competition from Ryanair, while a further 14 
face indirect (nearby airport) competition from Ryanair services, leaving 30 destinations on which the two airlines do 
not compete (but may compete with other carriers).
Market share figures for both companies show that, in 2007, the combined entity would have had 73 per cent 
market share out of Dublin, but last year, the two airlines' Dublin share hit 80 per cent, with 84 per cent of Cork 
Airport business.
Market share figures also suggest that Aer Lingus has been growing its market share in Dublin of late, while 
Ryanair's has been slipping slightly, from 40 per cent in 2010 to 39 per cent in 2011. Ryanair's price hikes to cover 
rising fuel costs may have had an impact in Dublin.
So buying Aer Lingus is about boosting revenues and profits on what is a very lucrative gateway into and out of 
Ireland.
But Aer Lingus is also about other things for Ryanair. The no-frills airline has talked, somewhat vaguely, about 
looking at long-haul options in the future. But nothing has happened on that front.
The question is whether the true Ryanair model would work on long haul. Acquiring Aer Lingus, with its long-
established North American service, would give Ryanair a toe in the water here. In that sense, it might create a bit 
of a buzz around a new dimension to the Ryanair growth story.
The company has continued to grow enormously in recent years, but its days of exponential growth are ending. It 
has taken decisions such as using cash to pay dividends rather than aggressive growth strategies in the last two 
years.
Perhaps the company, now more successful than ever, is pausing for breath and an Aer Lingus deal would allow it 
to push on in a number of new ways.
One cannot underestimate the power, influence and personality of Ryanair's driving force, its chief executive 
Michael O'Leary. After leading the company into many dogfights with rivals, airport authorities, governments and 
advertising standards agencies, O'Leary may see the buyout of Aer Lingus as a final piece of unfinished business.
Buying the incumbent, even if you have overtaken it in size several times over, would be the icing on the cake. It is 
hard to imagine that O'Leary would allow his feelings about something to overtake the 'profit imperative' that he has 
embodied so successfully, but acquiring the airline may provide big profits and a little sweetener.
Something else O'Leary has talked only vaguely about is retiring. Yet there is no sign of that happening right now. 
He has gone past being motivated by personal financial reward. He has so far cashed in over EUR 200 million-
worth of Ryanair shares. and his remaining stake is worth about another EUR 200 million. O'Leary has received 
around EUR 35 million in the last two years alone from share sales and dividends.
Aer Lingus bid: Third time lucky
Analysts doubt that the competition obstacles to this latest bid can be overcome and remain a little puzzled about it. 
Conspiracy theorists suggest it is just about flushing out a counter offer with a view to exiting an Aer Lingus 
shareholding that has cost Ryanair money.
Time will tell if the move does flush out a buyer. Despite a third attempt, O'Leary may not get to put the final part of 
the Irish aviation jigsaw together.

Turkish Airlines has emerged as a potential suitor for Aer Lingus, following a surprise buyout bid from Ryanair last 
week.
The Turkish carrier is one of a number of international airlines now assessing Aer Lingus, with well-placed sources 
telling The Sunday Business Post that the Turkish national carrier was very interested in the Irish airline.
Turkish Airlines, a major international carrier, can hold only a 49 per cent stake in the airline as it is outside the EU, 
but sources say it could buy the government's 25 per cent stake or, alternatively, team up in a joint venture 
partnership with another airline.
The same applies to Etihad Airways, the United Arab Emirates-based airline which has already expressed an 
interest in buying the state's stake in Aer Lingus.
The move by Ryanair, coupled with the state's commitment to selling its holding next year, has led to intense 
speculation about the future ownership of Aer Lingus.
Turkish Airlines and Etihad view Dublin as a potential hub through which passengers could be routed to the Far 
East and beyond.
A number of international airlines have noted Ryanair's comments that it would be willing to offload its existing 29 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus if another party acquires the government's 25 per cent holding.

Labour backbenchers are uneasy but resigned to the sale of some state assets. However, they are overtly hostile to 
the sale of any of them to Michael O'Leary.
Labour TDs discussed the Ryanair offer to buy the former state airline at the parliamentary party's weekly meeting 
on Wednesday, with the mood overwhelmingly hostile, especially among TDs in constituencies close to the airport, 
where many of the airline's 3,400 employees live.
Most Labour TDs are instinctively hostile to any sale of state assets, and the subject often comes up at the 
parliamentary party meeting, say attendees. But they have a very specific objection to Ryanair, whose refusal to 
recognise trade unions inflames Labour's allies in the trade union movement.
The unions are deeply hostile towards Ryanair and resent the airline's success, which they believe has promoted 
anti-union practices elsewhere.
"I think it's good for the state to have shares in what was the national airline," says Dublin Mid-West TD Joanna 
Tuffy. "You don't want a monopoly either. If there are monopolies, it's better that they are owned by the state."
Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar -- as instinctively pro-privatisation as Labour is against it -- has said that the 25 
per cent is for sale. But several Labour TDs privately expressed the hope that the stake would not be sold.
"I'd be of the opinion that they shouldn't sell the minority stake at all," Tuffy said.
Dublin North Central TD  odhan - Riordáin said: "Nobody would celebrate selling 25 per cent of a state asset, that's 
for sure."
However, one rural TD suggested that real hard-core opposition to selling off the remaining part of the airline was 
mostly confined to the Dublin TDs whose constituencies were close to the airport. "The real issue is jobs," the TD 
said. "If I thought we could create jobs by selling off Aer Lingus, I'd throw it out the door."
Aer Lingus bid: Coalition differs over sale of airline
Fianna Fail senator Darragh O'Brien, who is based in Malahide and was previously a TD for Dublin North, said: "It's 
always one of the top issues in north Dublin -- it always is. We all live near the airport and it's a big part of our lives. 
Everyone is very protective of it."
There's a couple of thousand votes directly linked to the airport and its airlines. That's a lot of votes in an Irish 
election, and they tend to vote as a bloc. Local political sources say that the fortunes of the airport -- and of Aer 
Lingus especially -- often decide seats at election time. Socialist Party TDs Joe Higgins and Clare Daly, whose 
constituencies are near the airport, will particularly target Labour TDs.
Having received a battering on the doorsteps during the Lisbon referendum campaign, many Labour TDs are 
feeling rather tender at the moment. They're hoping that regulatory and competition authorities deal with the 
"problem" of O'Leary's offer before they have to.

Are Google, Amazon and Microsoft 'buying the internet'? And who cares anyway?
Two weeks ago, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) revealed applications for 
1,930 new 'dot something' web addresses. In other words, it is ready to allow loads of new domain extensions, such 
as .love or .car or .baby.
At the moment, most people commonly use .com, .net or their country domain (.ie, .fr, .de and others) when setting 
up a website.
To apply for a domain extension, you had to pay $185,000, which quickly defined the nature of the applicants and 
limited the words that were applied for (no one applied for .drimnagh, for example).
Critics now charge that only big, rich corporations were in a position to apply. As a result, they say, extensions such 
as .news, .book and .app -- which have potential universal application -- will be hoovered up and reserved by one of 
a small number of individual corporations for their own exploitation.
Big deal. Does owning .news mean that you would have a lock on the online news market? Of course not. Amazon 
has applied for 76 domain extensions. Among these are .joy, .fast and .silk. Does that mean that Amazon now has 
a glorious inside track on services that are joyful or fast or silky? The notion is ridiculous and is reminscent of an 
over-eager start-up company's funding pitch in 1999.
Fine, say critics, but what about more market-oriented generic names? Take .cloud, they say: owning that extension 
could cut off this 'vertical' market domain address to competitors with cloud-based services.
But this makes as much sense as saying that he who owns computers.com has cornered the online marketplace for 
selling computers. When is the last time you typed in houses.ie to research a new home or flights.ie to book a 
flight? If .houses or .flights became a reality, would MyHome.ie or Ryanair.com change their internet addresses? It's 
very doubtful.
Reality Bytes: The domain drain
What is a vertical term, anyway? If you want search for property, would the correct extension be .houses, .property, 
.apartments or .homes? What about .semi-detached? Or .penthouse? Or .townhouse?
You can see why those in the internet domain reservation industry would very much like this explosion of new 
domains that companies would feel compelled to register.
But for ordinary companies and people, it would seem to be of marginal relevance.
Besides, who actually uses domains other than .com, .net or country domains (.ie, .fr and so on)? When is the last 
time you saw someone launch a major service with a .net or .biz or .tv domain extension?
Other than Last.fm, Bit.ly and maybe Blip.tv, how many non-'traditional' domain extension websites could you name 
off the top of your head? Five? Even three?
Just because Google applies for .fly (which it has), that doesn't mean that anyone is going to associate Google with 
flights or flight information without massive development on Google's part.
So let Google spend EUR 15 million of its shareholders' money applying for domain extensions such as .dad, .goo 
and .lol. Let Amazon spend over EUR 10 million of its investors' cash on .fire, .spot and .wow.
For 99.99 per cent of the world, it won't make a blind bit of difference to how we use the internet.

Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, has claimed that Aer Lingus has no long-term independent future, 
but if he succeeds in buying the former state airline, he'll be acquiring a company on the turn.
As the Aer Lingus board pointed out in its rejection of Ryanair's EUR 1.30 per share offer last Wednesday, chief 
executive Christoph Mueller has helped to improve the operating performance by EUR 130 million since taking over 
in 2009.
The company's latest trading statement, covering the first quarter of this year, also shows the key numbers moving 
in the right direction. Revenue was up more than 15 per cent year-on-year, while gross cash increased 8.3 per cent 
to more than EUR 1 billion.
But O'Leary would see a lot of room for improvement in Aer Lingus's operating costs, which rose by nearly 6 per 
cent in the three months to the end of March. It wasn't just fuel costs which hit airlines hard as oil prices spiked. 
Staff costs and airport charges also went up.
Perhaps Mueller's plan to get Aer Lingus into sustainable profit will come good eventually, but Ryanair's proposition 
-- cash now -- has to be tempting for shareholders. Its market capitalisation of EUR 570 million is less than the EUR 
700 million deficit in its company pension scheme. Ryanair is ten times bigger. In fact, the disparity in market cap 
between the two airlines is so big that buying Aer Lingus does not need Ryanair shareholder approval because it 
qualifies as an 'insignificant transaction'.
Ryanair also has cash to burn, with EUR 3.5 billion sitting on its balance sheet just waiting to be deployed. The 
airline has thrown off some of that cash in the form of a special dividend and share buybacks totalling EUR 1 billion 
over the last five years. The board has proposed a EUR 0.34 per share special dividend again this year, which will 
return EUR 483 million to shareholders -- more than two-thirds the price offered for Aer Lingus.
For Ryanair shareholders, this is a small deal that could lead to big things if it means challenging the European 
majors. For Aer Lingus shareholders, it is a question of cash-in-hand versus uncertain long-term value.

September 27, 2006: Ryanair starts to acquire a substantial number of shares in Aer Lingus.
**October 4, 2006:**Ryanair's stake in Aer Lingus rises to 16 per cent.
**October 5, 2006:**Ryanair increases its stake in Aer Lingus to 19.6 per cent before launching its first bid to buy 
the airline.
Chief executive Michael O'Leary says: "Without Ryanair, Aer Lingus will continue to be a small regional European 
airline which, because of its size and regional nature, is unlikely to be of interest or relevance to the three major 
European airline groupings."
**November 29, 2006:**Ryanair confirms it has taken its stake in Aer Lingus to 26.2 per cent.
**December 21, 2006:**Ryanair withdraws its bid, but says it intends to pursue another bid in the near future. 
"Ryanair remains committed to acquiring Aer Lingus," O'Leary says.
**June 27, 2007:**the European Commission declares a takeover bid incompatible with EU competition rules.
Ryanair challenges the decision and also brings its shareholding up to 29.8 per cent
"There's always a silver lining to every grey cloud," O'Leary says, referring to the "huge losses" suffered by Aer 
Lingus pilots who bought shares in the airline to prevent the takeover.
**November 19, 2007:**Aer Lingus Group plc files a lawsuit in the European Court of First Instance, hoping to force 
Ryanair to sell its 29.8 per cent holding in Aer Lingus.
"Aer Lingus is likely to be taken over," O'Leary says, "but the most likely candidate to take over Aer Lingus is 
Ryanair, because frankly nobody else has any interest in taking over Aer Lingus."
Aer Lingus bid: timeline
**December 1, 2008:**Ryanair launches a second bid for Aer Lingus, making a EUR 748 million all-cash offer. The 
Aer Lingus board rejects the offer and advises shareholders to take no action. O'Leary says the deal "will form one 
Irish airline group with the financial strength to compete with Europe's three major airline groups -- Air France, 
British Airways and Lufthansa".
**January 30, 2009:**Ryanair withdraws its bid.
"It is doubtful that Ryanair will waste any further management time or resources making another offer for Aer 
Lingus, as its scale and losses will continue to render it increasingly irrelevant in Europe's airline landscape," 
O'Leary says.
**July 6, 2010:**the European Court of Justice rules that Ryanair's takeover bid of Aer Lingus should be blocked.
"This will not prevent Ryanair making a future offer for Aer Lingus, but obviously any such offer will have to take 
account of the court's detailed ruling," O'Leary says.
**October 29, 2010:**consumer regulators in Britain open an investigation into Ryan-air's 29.8 per cent 
shareholding in Aer Lingus.
"We have asked our lawyers to liaise directly with the office to bring this out-of-time and unnecessary query to an 
early conclusion," O'Leary says.
**June 19, 2012:**Ryanair launches its third bid for Aer Lingus at EUR 1.30 a share, which values the airline at 
approximately EUR 694 million.

There is much to admire in Michael O'Leary's terrier-like qualities. But, with his third bid for Aer Lingus in six years , 
is he just banging his head against a brick wall?
There is a poisonous rivalry between the Irish flag carrier and Mr O'Leary's Ryanair. But his first takeover bid in 
2006 was scuppered not by Aer Lingus's unwillingness to be swallowed by its more successful competitor, but by 
Europe's competition authorities. The second was foiled by the Irish government - which owns a quarter of Aer 
Lingus - sniffily dismissing the price offered.
So why does Mr O'Leary think it's worth another try?
He is certainly offering a persuasive price. Ryanair's offer of EUR1.30 per share in cash is nearly 40 per cent higher 
than Aer Lingus' pre-offer share price, and values the airline significantly above its peers. And while Aer Lingus is 
certainly no longer the basket case it used to be - it made a small pre-tax profit last year - its shareholders might 
well be grateful that Ryanair would also take on some particularly nasty pension liabilities.
For Ryanair shareholders, a purchase would be a useful way to deploy the airline's available cash, and there is no 
doubt that Aer Lingus would benefit financially from Mr O'Leary's famous, if not notorious, cost-cutting skills. 
Meanwhile the government could sell its 25 per cent stake - a requirement of the country's bailout.
But it is also possible that Mr O'Leary is playing a more cunning game. The UK Competition Commission is looking 
into whether Ryanair's current 29.9 per cent stake in Aer Lingus is anti-competitive . The bid could, at the very least, 
delay a decision - and thus a possible forced sale of the stake in what are far from ideal market conditions.
Alternatively Mr O'Leary may be trying to flush out an alternative bidder for Aer Lingus, which would allow Ryanair 
to exit gracefully (albeit still probably at a large loss). This seems less likely, in that prospective buyers, such as the 
Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad, which already owns 3 per cent of Aer Lingus, may well be stymied by restrictions 
on foreign ownership.
It's high time for Ireland 's airlines to consolidate
These very restrictions, though, highlight how old-fashioned the rules governing airline takeovers are. Mr O'Leary 
argues that the world has changed since he last bid for Aer Lingus - and he has a point. For never has the need for 
airline consolidation been greater. This month the International Air Transport Association forecast that European 
airlines would report a combined net loss of $1.1bn this year, one of several years of losses in the past decade. 
Even the strongest, such as International Airlines Group, parent of British Airways and Iberia, are only expecting to 
break even. Yet barely any airline has gone under, or merged with a rival.
For Ireland to have two large airlines has always seemed anomalous. This is one brick wall that deserves to be 
knocked down.

Air France has announced plans to cut more than 5,000 jobs , or 10 per cent of its domestic workforce, over the 
next 18 months at the start of what could be a wave of redundancy programmes.
As the most troubled part of the merged group Air France-KLM, the French airline is struggling with staffing costs 30 
per cent higher than those of rivals including fellow "legacy" operators such as Lufthansa, and   Ryanair and 
easyJet, the low-cost carriers.
The redundancy programme is part of Transform 2015, a plan to cut EUR2bn in costs, achieve a 20 per cent 
increase in productivity and get the airline back to break-even in 2014. Air France-KLM, carrying more than 
EUR6bn in net debt, reported an operating loss of EUR597m in the first quarter on revenues of EUR5.7bn.
In a nod to the new Socialist government, which holds a 16 per cent stake in Air France-KLM - and in an effort to 
avoid conflict with France's strike-prone trade unions - the carrier said all the redundancies would be carried out on 
a voluntary basis if it could reach agreement with the unions. But it said compulsory job losses would be 
unavoidable if no deal was done.
The scale of the job cuts may be a taste of things to come in France as the economy has stalled and its industrial 
competitiveness has plunged, especially compared with Germany. Redundancies and plant closures are expected 
in the car, steel, telecoms, banking and other industries.

SHARES in Aer Lingus dipped 3.2 per cent yesterday after the firm's board and the Irish government dismissed 
Ryanair's takeover bid for the former flag carrier.
But Aer Lingus stock closed at (EURO)1.05, above Ryanair's (EURO)1.03 per share offer price, as investors and 
analysts looked at the next steps for the firm.
The Irish government, which has expressed an interest in selling its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, appeared to 
spurn Ryanair's bid yesterday.
"I have always taken the view that Aer Lingus is undervalued," transport minister Leo Varadker told the state 
broadcaster RTE. "The offer being made proves that."
But Aer Lingus' third-largest shareholder, telecoms billionaire Denis O'Brien, said he was buying up more shares, 
telling Bloomberg that Ryanair's bid could be "a ploy" to kick off talks with fellow investor Etihad.
Ryanair, which plans to run Aer Lingus as a separate and competing company if its bid succeeds, is already the 
firm's largest shareholder with a stake of around 30 per cent.
But competition authorities, which helped block two previous bids by Ryanair, have refused to say whether they 
would back the bid.
"Some of the market clearly does not believe Ryanair will be allowed to buy it," said Alan Duff, a trader with NCB 
stockbrokers in Dublin.
Irish minister says Ryanair 's bid for Aer Lingus is too low
"There are a lot of unknowns that haven't been ironed out. People are waiting for more clarification on the anti-trust 
side of the deal."

According to Irish mythology, three sets of plucks on Daghdha's harp produced first tears, then mirth and finally 
sleep. Ryanair's third bid in six years for rival Irish carrier Aer Lingus did not quite have the last effect. But reaction 
to the EUR700m offer was muted: Aer Lingus shares gained 15 per cent, but remained one-fifth below the EUR1.30 
offer price.
That reflects deep scepticism that Ryanair will ever get a merger deal past Europe's competition authorities. 
Brussels rebuffed the proposed tie-up in 2007 because it would mean a near-monopoly on Irish short-haul flights, 
including more than 80 per cent of those via Dublin. Ryanair is right when it says that the world has changed 
markedly since then. But in this case, the two airlines - both profitable - remain dominant in their home market.
Deutsche Bank estimates that, combined, they would control between 80 and 90 per cent of UK-Ireland and 
Europe-Ireland capacity. True, more terminal space removes a barrier to new entrants at Dublin, but this hardly 
guarantees effective competition. A more pertinent question may be whether concessions could be carved out to 
assuage competition worries. But the carriers provide rival services on about 30 Dublin-Europe routes, so these 
would have to be chunky - more perhaps than Ryanair would concede.
More convincing is the theory that the low-cost carrier wants to get out in front of a UK inquiry, begun a few days 
ago , into whether Ryanair should be required to dispose of its 29.9 per cent stake in Aer Lingus and hopes to flush 
out rival interest.
The Irish government, with 25 per cent of Aer Lingus, is also under some pressure to dispose of its stake, given its 
financial problems. The problem is identifying would-be buyers, although Lufthansa, IAG and Etihad might have 
interest in parts. Good Irish legends are long, and this saga could run for a while yet.

SHARES in Aer Lingus soared 15.4 per cent yesterday after Ryanair's latest takeover bid, though the budget carrier 
said after the markets closed that the offer undervalues the firm.
Aer Lingus, which has been subject to three takeover offers from Ryanair since listing in 2006, urged its 
shareholders to take no action for now after the (EURO)1.30 per share approach late on Tuesday.
The former Irish flagship carrier said there is "significant uncertainty" over the likelihood of the bid succeeding, given 
previous and ongoing competition probes.
Ryanair's existing 29.82 per cent stake in Aer Lingus is under investigation by the UK Competition Commission, 
and the firm's previous takeover attempts were stymied by European competition bodies.
And the Irish government, which owns a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, also said yesterday it has concerns about 
the bid, which values the firm at (EURO)694m (£560.3m).
Taoiseach Enda Kenny said his government would not be forced into a fire-sale of its holding, telling the Dail: "The 
government would be concerned obviously in terms of competition, in terms of consumer facilities, in terms of price 
and access to the country."
Ryanair has said it would like Ireland's support, but could run Aer Lingus even if the state won't sell out.
"In our view, the chances of this renewed bid being approved have improved, but not necessarily decisively so," 
said Espirito Santo analysts.

Andrew Parker, Alex Barker and Jamie Smyth on O'Leary's expensive takeover journey
Body
Third time lucky? Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, hopes his third takeover bid in six years for Aer 
Lingus, Ireland's flag carrier, will be successful.
But Ryanair has a mountain to climb with European competition authorities, which rejected its first takeover 
proposal made in 2006. Apart from Ryanair, no company has ever tried to resurrect a transaction previously banned 
by the European Commission.
Some analysts conclude that Ryanair's new offer of EUR1.3 per Aer Lingus share , valuing the airline's equity at 
EUR694m, may be an attempt to flush out other bidders.
But European carriers are struggling with the eurozone crisis, and Gulf airlines with the financial firepower to launch 
a rival offer would almost certainly be unable to do so because of foreign ownership restrictions.
Aer Lingus' board yesterday said that it believed Ryanair's offer undervalued the carrier, and questioned whether 
the proposed transaction could be completed, partly because of the Commission's rejection of the 2006 bid. The 
board advised shareholders to take no action.
Mr O'Leary's takeover quest has proved expensive. Since 2006, Ryanair has spent EUR407.2m to amass a 29.8 
per cent stake in Aer Lingus, but the shareholding's value was written down to EUR79.7m in 2009 as the downturn 
took its toll on results.
Mr O'Leary argues the industry's landscape has changed dramatically since Europe's largest low-cost carrier by 
revenue launched its first takeover bid for Aer Lingus. He emphasises consolidation that leaves Europe with five big 
airline groups: Air France-KLM, easyJet, IAG, Lufthansa and Ryanair.
Ryanair defies Aer Lingus hurdles
Ryanair's fresh takeover proposal, by forming a bigger Irish airline group with substantial investment and 
employment plans, could play well with some in recession-battered Ireland.
Aer Lingus has obvious attractions for Ryanair. Christoph Mueller has made progress with the carrier's turnround 
since he became chief executive in 2009, when it was lossmaking.
Last year, Aer Lingus reported pre-tax profit of EUR84.4m, and at March 31 it had a net cash position of 
EUR445.9m. But while Aer Lingus is profitable, it seems subscale in the context of consolidation.
By combining with Ryanair, Aer Lingus would secure its long-term future, with the budget airline able to apply its 
cost-cutting expertise across the enlarged group.
Mr O'Leary says Ryanair and Aer Lingus would operate as separate brands. Aer Lingus would focus on short-haul 
routes to large European airports that Ryanair does not fly to, such as London's Heathrow. There are risks for 
Ryanair. Some of Aer Lingus' cash may be needed to fix large deficits in two pension schemes of which the carrier's 
current and former employees are members.
An immediate concern will be the attitude of the Irish government as well as competition authorities.
Ryanair's bid might have appeal in Dublin, given that it was priced at a 38.3 per cent premium to Aer Lingus' 
undisturbed share price on June 19.
The government has a 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, which it plans to sell by the terms of the Irish bailout agreed 
with the European Union and International Monetary Fund.
But Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, yesterday expressed concerns about the antitrust issues raised by 
Ryanair's bid - although he stressed that the government did not have a veto.
Ryanair has notoriously poor relations with the Commission, which mainly assesses airline mergers on a route-by-
route basis to see if competition will be diminished.
Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, highlights how Ryanair and Aer Lingus together operate 79 per cent of flight 
departures from Dublin airport.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, says Ryanair's offer may have reduced the risk that it is forced to make a 
distressed sale of its stake in Aer Lingus - the UK Competition Commission could delay its new investigation into 
the shareholding following the bid.
He adds that even if the bid fails, Ryanair may well get a better exit from Aer Lingus if it flushes out an alternative 
bidder.
But it is difficult to see who else would pursue a takeover of Aer Lingus. Air France-KLM, IAG and Lufthansa are not 
seen as likely suitors.
Etihad, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier that announced last month that it had bought a 3 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, 
has held talks about buying the Irish government's shareholding
But foreign ownership rules would probably prevent Etihad from having a controlling stake in Aer Lingus. An 
unstable shareholder structure could emerge at Aer Lingus, led by Ryanair and Etihad, with Mr O'Leary unable to 
realise his renewed ambition.

Rumours over deal activity propelled some of Europe's biggest gaining stocks yesterday.
Telecom Italia led gains across the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index for a second day on speculation that the company 
could spin off one of its units into a separate company. The group's saver shares - which do not carry a vote but 
offer preferred dividend rights - climbed 5.6 per cent to EUR0.63.
Shares have rallied more than 12 per cent since an Italian business daily reported that the telecommunications 
group planned to spin off its wholesale network access business. The group denied the story in Il Sole 24 Ore, 
calling it "groundless".
Shares in Aer Lingus  climbed 15.4 per cent to EUR1.09 after Ryanair made an all-cash offer for the Irish flag 
carrier.
The offer of EUR1.30 a share represents a 38.3 per cent premium to the share price close on Tuesday, and is the 
third time Ryanair has approached Aer Lingus in six years.
The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 per cent to 1,014.30. Shares in Hennes & Mauritz rose 4.8 per cent to

The Irish government is keeping an open mind on Ryanair's surprise new takeover bid for the national airline Aer 
Lingus but won't be "shoved into a fire sale" because of the country's debt difficulties, Prime Minister Enda Kenny 
said Wednesday.
Ryanair offered (EURO)1.30 ($1.65) per share for its main Irish rival Tuesday night, its third bid since Aer Lingus' 
2006 flotation. Aer Lingus shares jumped 15 percent Wednesday to close at (EURO)1.09 on the Irish Stock 
Exchange. Ryanair is Aer Lingus' biggest shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake, the government second with 
25 percent.
European Union competition authorities in 2007 ruled that a Ryanair-Aer Lingus merger would create an airline 
monopoly in Dublin, and Aer Lingus is continuing legal action in Britain against Ryanair in hopes of forcing it to 
dump its stake.
But Kenny, who became Ireland's leader last year after the country was forced to negotiate a (EURO)67.5 billion 
($86 billion) international bailout, notably did not rule out a sale to Ryanair, Ireland's most dynamic and successful 
business with surging cash reserves of (EURO)2.7 billion ($3.4 billion). And he noted that the government's 25 
percent stake no longer represents a blocking interest on any sale. During previous bids, an Aer Lingus employee 
trust also opposed Ryanair, but that trust was broken up in 2010.
"The government will give consideration to this bid. ... We don't have any veto over this," Kenny told opposition 
lawmakers, who appealed to him to rule out any deal with Ryanair.
Ireland is committed under terms of its European Union-International Monetary Fund loan deal to sell potentially 
(EURO)2 billion in state assets, including power plants, to drive its deficits back below EU limits by 2016. Ryanair's 
offer values Aer Lingus at nearly (EURO)694 million, meaning the government would gain (EURO)173.5 million.
Kenny said his government would sell its Aer Lingus holding only if sufficient competition on routes, fares and 
customer service could be safeguarded. "We're not going to get shoved into a fire sale here," he said.
Ireland open to new Ryanair bid for Aer Lingus
Aer Lingus advised its non-Ryanair shareholders Wednesday to take no action if they received an offer in the mail. 
In a statement the airline said Ryanair's offer was too low. It noted that EU regulators rejected Ryanair's first bid in 
2007, while Ryanair abandoned its second bid in 2008 after too few shareholders took up the offer. "Consequently 
there is significant uncertainty that any offer from Ryanair, if made, would be capable of completion," it said.
Aer Lingus has struggled in recent years to slash costs sufficiently to compete with Ryanair, which is Europe's 
fastest-growing airline. It has suffered regular battles with labor unions, whereas Ryanair doesn't recognize them. 
But it did post a modest profit last year and has been expanding its own European short-haul network.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary argues that the government must sell Aer Lingus because it needs the 
cash, and would be far better off selling to another Irish company. The other potential suitor, Etihad Airways of the 
United Arab Emirates, this year bought a 3 percent stake in Aer Lingus and has expressed interest in the 
government holding.
Ryanair already has stressed that, should another airline buy the government's shares, Ryanair would happily 
negotiate a sale of its own holding to the winning airline.
Shane Ross, an independent lawmaker and investment guru, urged the government to rule out selling to Ryanair 
because it would make O'Leary's airline too powerful in Ireland.
"This deal has the potential to convert Ryanair from being an aggressive, lean, mean, independent, challenging 
airline into a mega-gamekeeper in terms of Irish airlines. And I think it would be very dangerous," Ross told a 
parliamentary debate on the issue.
Trade union and tourism leaders likewise called for Aer Lingus to remain independent of Ryanair. Michael Vaughan, 
president of the Irish Hotels Federation, said he feared Ryanair would sell off Aer Lingus' slots at Heathrow, the 
only major London airport that Ryanair doesn't currently use. They are Aer Lingus' most valuable asset because 
airlines covet slots at Heathrow, one of Europe's biggest hubs.
"Ultimately, what we need is more entrants into the Irish aviation space, not consolidation among the two major 
airlines," Vaughan said.
Travel industry analyst Simon Calder said that wasn't necessarily true, because airlines across Europe have been 
merging into fewer, more powerful groups to survive recession and higher oil prices.
Calder said Ireland's argument over whether to keep two airlines "is a problem that most small European countries 
would love to have. Most have either one or no international airlines."
"The basic problem here is market domination," Calder said, noting that there's comparatively less competition 
already on Irish air routes versus their British counterparts. "Other airlines should be able to keep Ryanair honest. 
But the larger a market share that a single airline has, the more it can control fares."

Ryanair has formally bid E1.30 for Aer Lingus.
In a statement to the Irish Stock Exchange, the airline said the offer values Aer Lingus at approximately E694m.
Ryanair already owns 29.82pc of Aer Lingus in a stake acquired over five years ago.
The stake was reviewed by the European Union and has recently been referred by the UK Office of Fair Trade to 
the UK Competition Commission.
Ryanair will make the offer through a wholly owned subsidiary, Coinside Ltd.
The 29.8pc stake was acquired for the most part by Ryanair between late 2006 and early 2007. Ryanair said the 
cash offer represents a premium of 38.3pc over the Aer Lingus closing price. A spokesperson for Aer Lingus said it 
had no comment to make on the Ryanair bid. Ryanair said it believes that the future of the Aer Lingus will be best 
served as part of Ryanair and that Ryanair will be one of five large airline groupings in Europe as the market 
consolidates. The Ryanair statement also notes the context of the offer in that European airlines are consolidating, 
Dublin airport is operating at 50pc capacity, that the Government is selling its 25pc share in Aer Lingus and has 
committed to the Troika to do so. It notes Etihad's 3pc stake and its reported "strong interest" in Aer Lingus. The 
Ryanair statement notes that the Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) no longer controls 15pc of Aer Lingus. 
Ryanair says that its confident that 50pc of Aer Lingus shareholders will accept the offer according to an RTE 
report.

Body
Trade union, IMPACT has today written to Transport Minister Leo Varadkar to urge the Government to refer a 
Ryanair bid for control of Aer Lingus to the Irish and EU regulatory authorities.
The union, which represents over 1,600 staff in Aer Lingus, argues that any takeover would be un-competitive as it 
would create a virtual monopoly in commercial flights between Ireland and the UK, with inevitable ticket price 
increases.
The union also says a Ryanair takeover could jeopardise inward investment, and Ireland's economic recovery, by 
placing doubt over the future use of Aer Lingus's valuable Heathrow slots, which are currently used exclusively for 
Irish-UK traffic.
Ryanair last night launched an all cash bid for Aer Lingus of E1.30 per share, a 38pc premium to Tuesday's close. 
"This is an unexpected move an comes at the same time as the UK Competition Commission starts its investigation 
into Ryanair's existing 29pc holding in Aer Lingus. Given their relative sizes Ryanair does not require shareholder 
approval for this deal. Technically, it does not need the State's 25pc holding either to secure majority control. While 
Ryanair insists that circumstances have changed since its previous bid, the key issue will be whether or not the EC 
will permit such a deal it previously blocked. While many of Ryanair's arguments are logical we would be surprised 
if the EC reversed its previous decision," according to Gerard Moore of Merrion Stockbrokers. "Ryanair states that 
is looking to acquire Aer Lingus and then to operate two competing airlines within one group. It would look to use 
Aer Lingus to compete more aggressively with existing European airlines at large primary airports, which it tends to 
avoid. It would target to reduce unit costs and increase Aer Lingus traffic figures from 9.5m passengers to 14m over 
a five year period. It would also look to expand Aer Lingus' transatlantic operations."

A takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would harm the long-term interests of Irish tourism, the Irish Hotels Federation 
(IHF) said today.
Michael Vaughan, President of the IHF said that the proposed takeover would result in serious competition issues 
around air access into Ireland and called on the Government to ensure a suitable buyer is found for the airline that 
copper fastens competition and ensures Aer Lingus' valuable Heathrow remain available to Ireland in the future.
"Even if Ryanair were to run the two companies separately, there would be serious monopoly concerns around air 
transit into Ireland," says Mr Vaughan. "In terms of the Heathrow slots, these were acquired when Aer Lingus was 
under state ownership and they are of vital strategic importance to the country and our longterm tourism prospects. 
I'd be very worried about their future under a Ryanair acquisition."
"Mindful that there's a strategic position to be adopted in finding a buyer for Aer Lingus, we're urging the 
Government to ensure air access and greater competition, which is extremely important for attracting visitors. 
Ultimately, we what we need is more entrants into the Irish aviation space, not consolidation among the two major 
airlines." "As it stands, Ireland has already become overly reliant on Ryanair and Aer Lingus, which between them 
now account for almost 80 percent of traffic into and out of Dublin. They are also the dominant players across 
Ireland's regional airports. A takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would only exacerbate the situation would not be 
aligned with the interests of the Irish economy." Mr Vaughan also states that a full service airline like Aer Lingus is 
critical for the route to market that Ireland maintains in certain key markets, such as North America. He states, "The 
difficulty we would have is there could be a widespread consolidation of routes out of key markets with reduced 
choice for visitors and over time possibly less air traffic coming in to the country. The other great difficulty is that the 
valuable Heathrow slots may be churned for use by other Ryanair routes out of the UK."

Aer Lingus today issued a statement saying that Ryanair's third bid to buy it out undervalues that airline and would 
likely fail competition requirements.
"The Board, having considered the Offer with its advisers, believes the Offer, even if it is capable of completion, 
undervalues Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus shareholders are accordingly advised to take no action in relation to the Offer," 
it said.
The statement added that the UK Competition Commission (CC) is currently investigating Ryanair's 29.82pc 
holding in Aer Lingus with the result that Ryanair is now under a legal prohibition from undertaking any further 
integration with Aer Lingus without the consent of the CC.
Aer Lingus added that Ryanair may be subject to an order to sell down its shares at the end of the CC investigation. 
"Furthermore the Board notes that Ryanair's unsolicited offer in 2006 was blocked by the European Commission 
and was not capable of completion and that Ryanair's second offer, in 2008, was withdrawn. Consequently there is 
significant uncertainty that any offer from Ryanair, if made, would be capable of completion." "The Aer Lingus 
management team has delivered a significantly improved operational and financial performance since 2009, 
transforming Aer Lingus into a robust, profitable airline which is well positioned to serve the key role of "Connecting 
Ireland to the World". Management's successful strategy of focusing on demand-led network management and the 
introduction of extensive cost saving initiatives has delivered sustained and improved profitability, resulting in a 
turnaround in operating performance of approximately E130 million since 2009. Aer Lingus has a proven business 
model and a strong balance sheet including cash of in excess of E1 billion at 31 March 2012, leaving it well 
positioned for the future," the Aer Lingus statement said.

"Furthermore the Board notes that Ryanair's unsolicited offer in 2006 was blocked by the European Commission 
and was not capable of completion and that Ryanair's second offer, in 2008, was withdrawn. Consequently there is 
significant uncertainty that any offer from Ryanair, if made, would be capable of completion." "The Aer Lingus 
management team has delivered a significantly improved operational and financial performance since 2009, 
transforming Aer Lingus into a robust, profitable airline which is well positioned to serve the key role of "Connecting 
Ireland to the World". Management's successful strategy of focusing on demand-led network management and the 
introduction of extensive cost saving initiatives has delivered sustained and improved profitability, resulting in a 
turnaround in operating performance of approximately E130 million since 2009. Aer Lingus has a proven business 
model and a strong balance sheet including cash of in excess of E1 billion at 31 March 2012, leaving it well 
positioned for the future," the Aer Lingus statement said.

Aer Lingus today issued a statement saying that Ryanair's third bid to buy it out undervalues that airline and would 
likely fail competition requirements.
"The Board, having considered the Offer with its advisers, believes the Offer, even if it is capable of completion, 
undervalues Aer Lingus. Aer Lingus shareholders are accordingly advised to take no action in relation to the Offer," 
it said.
The statement added that the UK Competition Commission (CC) is currently investigating Ryanair's 29.82pc 
holding in Aer Lingus with the result that Ryanair is now under a legal prohibition from undertaking any further 
integration with Aer Lingus without the consent of the CC.

Irish supply chain solutions and development company PCH International will more than double its global 
headcount with a multimillion-euro facility to fulfil new contracts with consumer electronics companies.
The 27,000sq m plant in Shenzhen, China, will employ an additional 1,500 people including expatriate and local 
staff, and will be fully operational by the end of July. The company currently employs 1,200 people. The low-carbon, 
energy-efficient facility will be located in the heart of the Futian Free Trade Zone in the southern Chinese city.
Cork-headquartered PCH has operations in the US and in Shenzhen. The company designs, builds and ships 
consumer electronics devices and accessories on behalf of some of the world's largest brands, including Apple.
"We are seeing a huge increase in demand from our global clients and this new facility will cater to their needs," 
said Liam Casey, founder and chief executive of PCH International. "This facility will offer expanded packaging, 
configuration, postponement and fulfilment services - everything our clients require to finish and perfect their 
products."
Shenzhen, just across the border from Hong Kong, has been experiencing a slowdown of late, but Mr Casey said 
the expansion reflected a growing focus on services in China. "This is contrary to what is being said about 
Shenzhen. The work we're doing is in demand. Premier Wen Jiabao said recently that China had to put its focus on 
services and increase its service offering. The work we do is classic services. "We are adding value to products 
coming off the production line, that's what we do." There has been a labour shortage in southern China in the past 
few years, and providing good working conditions has become essential to help woo talent. "You have to have good 
conditions to get workers," said Mr Casey. PCH is reported to be planning a stock market listing in Hong Kong, but 
the Hong Kong market has been sluggish for months now and it's generally not considered a good year for IPOs. 
The Irish Times XXXX Ryanair has made its third takeover bid for Aer Lingus, saying the long-term future of its rival 
Roundup-Quinn kids can't live on E2K PW; Roundup
"can best be secured within one strong Irish airline group, led by Ryanair". At E1.30 per share, Ryanair's new cash 
offer values Aer Lingus at E694 million, meaning the Government could receive E173.5 million for its 25 per cent 
stake. Ryanair, which already owns a 29.82 per cent stake in Aer Lingus, said it believed "circumstances have 
changed materially" since it made its first unsuccessful bid for Aer Lingus in late 2006. It said there were 
"compelling reasons" why the fresh bid should be accepted by shareholders and approved by EU competition 
authorities. "This offer represents a significant opportunity to combine Aer Lingus with Ryanair, to form one strong 
Irish airline capable of competing with Europe's other major airline groups led by Air France, British Airways and 
Lufthansa," said chief executive Michael O'Leary. Ryanair said it would keep Aer Lingus as a separate airline and 
develop its brand as part of an airline group that, if its bid was successful, would have combined traffic of almost 90 
million passengers a year. A spokesman for Aer Lingus said the company had no comment on the takeover bid. In 
a statement outlining the details of its offer to buy the entire share capital of Aer Lingus, Ryanair says it understands 
the Government plans to sell its stake in early 2013. It argues that if the stake is sold to a foreign-owned company, 
a break-up of Aer Lingus would be "inevitable". Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways recently built up a near 3 per cent 
stake in Aer Lingus, with chief executive James Hogan noting in April that the company was "keen to have a look" 
at the Government's 25 per cent holding. Ryanair's offer, which will be made through its wholly-owned subsidiary 
Coincide Ltd, represents a 38 per cent premium over Aer Lingus's closing price of 94 cents on the Iseq index 
yesterday. It is also 47 per cent higher than Aer Lingus's average closing price over the last six months, according 
to Ryanair. Minister for Transport Leo Varadkar previously indicated that the Government would not dispose of its 
stake for less than E1 per share. Ryanair had earlier ruled out making a third bid for the company, after its first 
E2.80 per share bid and the E1.40 per share bid it made in January 2009 were both rejected by shareholders. The 
Irish Times XXXX A Shannon based company engaged in financing aircraft leasing recorded pretax profits of dollar 
765 million (E606 million) last year, new figures show. The pretax profit of dollar 765 million for the US-owned GE 
Capital Aviation Funding - with no employees - makes the company one of the most profitable public and private 
limited companies in the country. The figures show that pretax profits decreased by 15 per cent from dollar 900 
million to dollar 765 million, with impairment losses totalling dollar 62 million, a factor behind the drop in profits in 
the 12 months to the end of December last. The accounts also reveal that the firm's profits were hit by lower "other 
financial income" last year declining from dollar 165.4 million to dollar 39.9 million. All of the firm's revenues are 
generated in Ireland and according to the directors' report, "both the level of business and year end financial 
position were satisfactory and the directors expect that the present level of activity will be sustained for the 
foreseeable future". The pretax profits recorded make GE Capital Aviation Funding more profitable in 2011 than 
well-known Irish public limited companies such as the Kerry Group, Ryanair and Aer Lingus and private limited 
companies such as Vodafone Ireland. The figures show that GE Capital Aviation Funding paid dollar 379,000 in 
corporation tax on its pretax profit. The accounts show that the company would have been liable to pay dollar 95.6 
million in tax at the 12.5 per cent corporation tax rate. However, the tax bill was reduced through group relief of 
dollar 98.2 million and dollar 3 million in non-taxable items. The principal activity of the company is the provision of 
financing and lending to other related group companies in the aviation industry. The filings show that its GE aviation 
subsidiaries are located in France, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Malaysia, Bermuda, India, Russia, Mexico, 
Brazil and the US. The figures show that the company's revenue income of dollar 816.9 million represents the 
provision of financing and lending services with all income derived from activities in Ireland. The Irish Times XXXX 
THE children of former billionaire Sean Quinn will tell the High Court today that an order limiting their weekly spend 
to E2,000 each means they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and other expenses. The Quinns are expected to 
ask for more time to answer new claims they are involved in a "devious scheme" to squirrel away E400m worth of 
assets. They will also ask for more money to meet their day-to-day living costs The Irish Independent has learned 
the High Court will decide separately next week whether to jail Sean Quinn Snr, his son Sean Quinn Jnr and his 
nephew Peter Darragh Quinn for alleged breaches of court orders not to interfere with the family's international 
property portfolio. Last week, the former Anglo Irish Bank brought an emergency application seeking to freeze the 
assets of Sean Quinn's five children, two of his sons in law and his nephew Peter Darragh Quinn -- the former head 
of the family's International Property Group (IPG). The bank has accused the Quinns of secret moves designed to 
put properties beyond its reach by placing them into companies that will benefit the five Quinn children. As a result, 
Ciara Quinn, Collette Quinn, Sean Quinn Jnr, Brenda Quinn and Aoife Quinn were temporarily banned from 
reducing their personal assets below E50m. The five siblings, as well as their cousin Peter Darragh Quinn, were 
each allowed to withdraw E2,000 a week for living expenses ahead of the return of the case to the High Court 
today. The Irish Independent XXXX SO, what is Ireland's new bank, and can it plug the lending gap for businesses?

First things first. Silicon Valley is a region in California, centred on Stanford University. Since the 1970s it has been 
the global capital of the technology sector, home to massive success stories like Apple, Google and Sun 
Microsystems, as well as thousands of small spin-out ventures all hoping to be the next big thing. The region is 
rightly regarded as one of the world's great business stories -- not just because companies from there have done 
well, but because a huge proportion of the profits that pour back into the Valley every year are recycled back into 
new, often high-risk, technology ventures. It means that, almost uniquely, the region has fostered a culture of taking 
calculated risks and thinking in new ways. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which launched in Ireland yesterday, is the 
region's specialist lender, set up almost 30 years ago to provide banking services to businesses in the Valley. In its 
home market it acts just like any other bank -- taking deposits, making loans, managing company credit cards and 
providing trade financing. The key difference is the niche it has carved out for itself, including lending to firms that in 
many cases have little income and even lower profits -- at least initially. Most banks won't touch such companies, 
no matter how bright a future they might have. The bank will lend where others won't because, as a niche player, 
executives say they understand their clients better, and are plugged into a web of relationships, with entrepreneurs, 
technologists and investors. The Irish Independent

to E2,000 each means they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and other expenses. The Quinns are expected to 
ask for more time to answer new claims they are involved in a "devious scheme" to squirrel away E400m worth of 
assets. They will also ask for more money to meet their day-to-day living costs The Irish Independent has learned 
the High Court will decide separately next week whether to jail Sean Quinn Snr, his son Sean Quinn Jnr and his 
nephew Peter Darragh Quinn for alleged breaches of court orders not to interfere with the family's international 
property portfolio. Last week, the former Anglo Irish Bank brought an emergency application seeking to freeze the 
assets of Sean Quinn's five children, two of his sons in law and his nephew Peter Darragh Quinn -- the former head 
of the family's International Property Group (IPG). The bank has accused the Quinns of secret moves designed to 
put properties beyond its reach by placing them into companies that will benefit the five Quinn children. As a result, 
Ciara Quinn, Collette Quinn, Sean Quinn Jnr, Brenda Quinn and Aoife Quinn were temporarily banned from 
reducing their personal assets below E50m. The five siblings, as well as their cousin Peter Darragh Quinn, were 
each allowed to withdraw E2,000 a week for living expenses ahead of the return of the case to the High Court 
today. The Irish Independent XXXX SO, what is Ireland's new bank, and can it plug the lending gap for businesses?

First things first. Silicon Valley is a region in California, centred on Stanford University. Since the 1970s it has been 
the global capital of the technology sector, home to massive success stories like Apple, Google and Sun 
Microsystems, as well as thousands of small spin-out ventures all hoping to be the next big thing. The region is 
rightly regarded as one of the world's great business stories -- not just because companies from there have done 
well, but because a huge proportion of the profits that pour back into the Valley every year are recycled back into 
new, often high-risk, technology ventures. It means that, almost uniquely, the region has fostered a culture of taking 
calculated risks and thinking in new ways. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which launched in Ireland yesterday, is the 
region's specialist lender, set up almost 30 years ago to provide banking services to businesses in the Valley. In its 
home market it acts just like any other bank -- taking deposits, making loans, managing company credit cards and 
providing trade financing. The key difference is the niche it has carved out for itself, including lending to firms that in 
many cases have little income and even lower profits -- at least initially. Most banks won't touch such companies, 
no matter how bright a future they might have. The bank will lend where others won't because, as a niche player, 
executives say they understand their clients better, and are plugged into a web of relationships, with entrepreneurs, 
technologists and investors. The Irish Independent

The ISEQ slipped lower today despite a 15pc rise in Aer Lingus shares and a near 1pc gain for Ryanair after the 
latter's surprise bid for the former flag carrier.
The index fell 4.71 points to 3,083.58.
Shares in Aer Lingus soared 15c to E1.09 and Ryanair's stocks gained 4c to E4.02. Ryanair on Tuesday night 
launched an all cash bid for Aer Lingus of E1.30 per share, a 38pc premium to Tuesday's close.
Aer Lingus said that the bid is likely to meet the same competition obstacles as the two previous attempts and 
called on shareholders to do nothing while analysts expressed surprise at the Ryanair move. "This is an 
unexpected move an comes at the same time as the UK Competition Commission starts its investigation into 
Ryanair's existing 29pc holding in Aer Lingus. Given their relative sizes Ryanair does not require shareholder 
approval for this deal. Technically, it does not need the State's 25pc holding either to secure majority control. While 
Ryanair insists that circumstances have changed since its previous bid, the key issue will be whether or not the EC 
will permit such a deal it previously blocked. While many of Ryanair's arguments are logical we would be surprised 
if the EC reversed its previous decision," according to Gerard Moore of Merrion Stockbrokers. "Ryanair states that 
is looking to acquire Aer Lingus and then to operate two competing airlines within one group. It would look to use 
Aer Lingus to compete more aggressively with existing European airlines at large primary airports, which it tends to 
avoid. It would target to reduce unit costs and increase Aer Lingus traffic figures from 9.5m passengers to 14m over 
a five year period. It would also look to expand Aer Lingus' transatlantic operations." CRH's shares were up 13c to 
E14.38. The broader slowdown in the US economy has filtered through to the non-residential construction sector

Aer Lingus this morning urged shareholders to take no action on Ryanair's third bid for the airline pending a full 
statement later.
Ryanair last night launched a third bid to take over Irish rival Aer Lingus, offering shareholders a 38 percent 
premium to the market in a deal that would require regulators to drop opposition to a merger.
Europe's largest budget carrier, which already owns just under 30 percent of Aer Lingus, said in a statement after 
markets closed that it would offer 1.30 euros per share in a bid to secure at least 50 percent.
The bid, which values Aer Lingus at 694 million euros, would be subject to the approval of the European 
Commission, which in 2007 blocked an earlier bid by Ryanair for Aer Lingus on competition grounds. The surprise 
bid came after repeated offers by Ryanair to sell its stake in Aer Lingus and days after Britain's competition 
watchdog launched a probe into the control it already wields at its Irish rival. "This offer represents a significant 
opportunity to combine Aer Lingus with Ryanair, to form one strong Irish airline group capable of competing with 
Europe's other major airline groups," Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said in a statement. Aer Lingus, 
which operates out of Europe's largest airports, would complement Ryanair's fleet, which focuses on cheaper 
regional bases, he said. The Irish government, which is selling its own 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus as part of its 
EU/IMF bailout program, declined immediate comment, but has said in the past that it opposes an increase in 
Ryanair's control. O'Leary has long pursued the takeover of Aer Lingus, Ireland's 75-year-old former flag carrier, to 
cap the rise of Ryanair, which started with one 15-seater plane in 1985. In almost two decades in charge, O'Leary's 
low-cost model has come to dominate European aviation. Ryanair carried 77 million passengers last year compared 
with 9.5 million passengers at Aer Lingus. But to complete the deal, Ryanair would have to convince authorities that 
a combined airline controlling 80 percent of traffic between the United Kingdom and Ireland would not stifle 
competition. Britain's Office of Fair Trading last week ruled that Ryanair's ownership of a minority stake threatened

competition. "It is very hard to see how it would be accepted by European competition authorities," said Brian 
Devine, an analyst with NCB Stockbrokers. Ryanair said it believed it could overcome concerns about competition 
in the Irish market that derailed earlier bids, citing consolidation within the industry and increased capacity at Dublin 
airport. "Ryanair believes that any competition concerns ... can be addressed by Ryanair making appropriate 
remedies prior to the completion of this offer and by significant synergies and cost efficiencies resulting from this 
combination," it said in a statement. It said the fact that an employee share trust, which had opposed a merger, has 
been disbanded also increased the chances of securing 50 percent approval. Irish transport minister Leo Varadkar 
said he would make a statement on the offer after consulting with his cabinet colleagues. Aer Lingus' shareholders 
include Etihad Airways, which bought a 3 percent stake in May.

Aer Lingus is already 30 percent owned by Ryanair (Reuters)
Ryanair shares rose and Aer Lingus stock soared after the Europe's biggest budget airline made a third attempt to 
buy the 75-year-old Irish flag carrier, a move regulators have rejected before because of competition fears.
The offer is for  1.30 a share, a 38 percent mark-up on the market price when trading closed before the bid, and 
would see Ryainair increase its current 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus to 50 percent.
"This offer represents a significant opportunity to combine Aer Lingus with Ryanair, to form one strong Irish airline 
group capable of competing with Europe's other major airline groups," Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, 
said in a statement.
Aer Lingus stock rocketed by 24.7 percent in early trading to  1.15 at 08:25am BST. Elsewhere on the London 
Stock Exchange Ryanair shares had risen 1.08 percent on the day to  4.02 at the same time.
Ryanair's latest bid values Aer Lingus, which is a quarter owned by Ireland's government, at  694m. (£559.5m).
Irish lawmakers must sell the taxpayers' stake in Aer Lingus as part of the EU/IMF bailout deal.
If successful, Ryanair's bid would see it control 80 percent of the air traffic between the UK and Ireland, something 
that regulators have said in the past would stifle competition.
The company said it could negate competition fears by "making appropriate remedies prior to the completion of this 
offer and by significant synergies and cost efficiencies resulting from this combination."
In a separate ruling by the British Office for Fair trading in the week before the bid, Ryanair's existing stake in Aer 
Lingus was deemed to be hurting competition.
"We are concerned that Ryanair's shareholding places it in a position to influence the commercial policy and 
strategy of Aer Lingus in a number of different ways that could dampen competition to the disadvantage of UK 
passengers," Amelia Fletcher, OFT chief economist, said in a statement.
Aer Lingus Shares Soar After Latest Ryanair Takeover Bid
Fletcher said she would be referring the situation to the Competition Commission.
EU regulators rejected a full Ryanair/Aer Lingus merger in 2007 because of the dominance it would have in the Irish 
airline market.
In 2010 Ryanair's appeal against the regulators' decision was thrown out.

(RTTNews) - The UK market is in positive territory in afternoon trading Wednesday, as investors are anxiously 
looking for the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting, which is concluding today. The Fed may expand its bond-
buying program Operation Twist, which is scheduled to expire this month. There are also hopes that another round 
of quantitative easing may be announced.
At the G20 summit that concluded on Tuesday, Italy put forth a proposal urging Eurozone economies to allow the 
common rescue funds to buy the debt of troubled economies on the secondary markets. This would help the 
countries avoid a bailout and lower their borrowing costs.
The proposal, presented by Italy's Prime Minister Mario Monti, is backed by France. It is likely to be discussed at a 
meeting between the leaders of core euro area economies in Rome on June 22, reports said.
Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande called for the issuance of euro bills as a short-term measure, the 
newspaper Handelsblatt reported Tuesday, citing a strategy paper.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel denied that there were any discussions at G20 summit on using either the 
European Financial Stability Facility or the European Stability Mechanism to buy Eurozone sovereign debt.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks is losing 0.10 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 50 index, 
which includes some major U.K. companies, is falling 0.11 percent.
The FTSE 100 index is currently adding 0.37 percent.
Miners are seeing notable gains. Rio Tinto is adding over 2 percent after the miner said it would commit $4.2 billion 
to develop its tier one iron ore business to meet increased iron ore demand from Asian markets.
Sage Group is gaining 3.2 percent, reportedly on a positive broker recommendation.
Barclays is adding 1.6 percent and Standard Chartered is advancing 1.7 percent.
Insurer Aviva is gaining 3.2 percent. Hargreaves Lansdown is advancing 2.7 percent and ITV is rising 2.9 percent.
Kesa Electricals is falling 9.5 percent after posting a loss for the year. Petrofac is losing 2.8 percent.
UK Market In Positive Territory
Aer Lingus Group is surging 15.5 percent. Ryanair has said that it plans to make an all-cash offer worth $879 million 
for Aer Lingus. Ryanair shares are up marginally.
Elsewhere in Europe, the German DAX is adding 0.13 percent. The French CAC 40 is losing 0.26 percent and 
Switzerland's SMI is falling 0.49 percent.
In economic news, UK unemployment claims increased unexpectedly in May, the latest figures from the Office for 
National Statistics showed.
The jobless claims or claimant count increased by 8,100 from April to 1.60 million in May. This was forecast to fall 
by 4,000 on a month-on-month basis.
Meanwhile, policymakers of the Bank of England decided to retain the size of quantitative easing unchanged in a 
split vote, the minutes of the meeting showed. Four members of the Monetary Policy Committee sought more 
stimulus, while five members voted to maintain the QE intact at 325 billion pounds.
Across Asia/Pacific, markets ended mostly higher. Australia's All Ordinaries added 0.2 percent, Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng advanced 0.5 percent and Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1.1 percent. However, China's Shanghai Composite 
Index dropped 0.3 percent.
In the U.S., futures point to a mixed open on Wall Street. In the previous session, stocks moved higher as traders 
expressed continued optimism about the likelihood of further stimulus from the Federal Reserve.
In the commodity space, crude for July delivery is losing $0.22 to $83.81 per barrel and August gold is falling $9.3 
to $1613.9 a troy ounce.

European Shares To See Cautious Start Before Fed Decision

(RTTNews) - European stocks are seen opening a tad lower on Wednesday, as investors adopt a cautious 
approach awaiting the outcome of the Federal Reserve meeting which concludes later today.
The Fed may expand its bond-buying program dubbed 'Operation Twist' that is scheduled to end at month end, but 
a third round of quantitative easing seems unlikely. No matter what the Fed does, traders may take some profits off 
the table given investor concerns related to Europe and considerable uncertainty on the global economic outlook.
In recent Congressional testimony, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank remains prepared to take 
action if financial stresses escalate but made no explicit reference to further easing measures.
Asian stocks are trading mostly higher, tracking firm cues from Europe and the U.S. overnight, while the euro eased 
against the dollar. Commodities are mixed, with oil little changed and copper down modestly.
Official data released today showed that Japan posted a much bigger-than-expected merchandise trade deficit of 
about $11.5 billion in May, hit by soaring energy costs and weakening demand from struggling Europe.
The meeting of the Group of Twenty nations in Los Cabos, Mexico, concluded Tuesday with the leaders reinforcing 
their commitment to work collectively to foster growth, create high quality jobs and address the ongoing financial 
market tensions.
International Monetary Fund managing Director Christine Lagarde said "the seeds of a pan-European recovery plan 
were planted" in Los Cabos. Europe's intention to consider concrete steps towards a more integrated financial 
architecture is important and as such "I look forward to discussing this further when I visit Europe this week to 
finalize the IMF's annual review of the euro area," she added.
Alongside the G20 summit, IMF secured additional funds from 37 countries to create a $456 billion firewall to fight 
the impact of the global slowdown.
In domestic corporate news, IT services firm Sopra Group said that its new board of directors voted unanimously to 
separate the roles of chairman and chief executive officer effective 20 August 2012.
Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings Plc said that it plans to make an all-cash offer of 1.30 euros per share for rival Aer 
Lingus Group Plc, valuing it at about 694 million euros or $879 million.
European Shares To See Cautious Start Before Fed Decision
AstraZeneca Plc and Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. revealed an exclusive worldwide license agreement for the global 
development and commercialization of R256, Rigel's investigational drug for the treatment of moderate to severe 
chronic asthma.
Global miner Rio Tinto said it is taking the next steps in its phased investment program by committing $4.2 billion to 
develop its tier one iron ore business.
European stocks ended Tuesday's session sharply higher, as hopes that the Fed may do more to stimulate the 
world's largest economy outweighed concerns about Spain's fiscal and banking problems.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index of eurozone bluechip stocks climbed 2 percent and the Stoxx Europe 50 index, which 
includes some major U.K. companies, added 1.6 percent, while around Europe, Switzerland's SMI, France's CAC 
40, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 and the DAX of Germany finished up between 1.6 percent and 1.8 percent.
U.S. stocks posted solid gains overnight on continued speculation about the likelihood of further Fed stimulus. 
Some encouraging U.S. data concerning permits to build new homes and news that Spain has achieved its target at 
a bond sale auction, albeit at high costs, also supported risk sentiment. The Dow rose 0.8 percent, the tech-heavy 
Nasdaq gained 1.2 percent and the S&P 500 added a percent.

Ryanair take-over bid for Aer Lingus: 'take no action' 12.33: 'Take no action' Aer Lingus told shareholders today 
after a bid from Ryanair to take over the airline: and investors acted swiftly by buying the Aer Lingus shares, 
pushing the price up 19% this morning to just over 1.
The Irish government, which owns 25% of the Irish flag carrier, followed the airline's advice given in a brief 
regulatory statement and said no decision had been made on whether to support the bid.
It is the third bid from Ryanair, which is offering 1.30 a share, having been rebuffed twice before.
According to Reuters, Irish prime minister Enda Kenny said in parliament today:
'Details of the offer have not yet been considered collectively by government the government would be concerned 
obviously in terms of competition, in terms of consumer facilities, in terms of price and access to the country.
'But it is a minority share the government has. We don't have any veto.'

Aer Lingus said a full statement would be issued shortly.

its 'ECTR' auctions to provide six months loans announced last week by a worried Mervyn King £5 billion was

We don't know how many banks applied, nor which ones.
A quick update on the wider markets:
FTSE 100 up 8 points at 5,595 as UK and European markets tread water ahead of Fed announcement which is due 
this evening. Spanish and Italian borrowing costs have fallen back in Spain's case, 10 year government bond yields 
are back below the 7% danger zone, while Italian equivalents are below 6% Amid the economic weakness the oil 
price is again testing multi-month lows at $95 dollars UK unemployment drops by 51,000 10.07: Some mixed 
numbers on the UK labour market. Here are the highlights:
Asforecast by economists the unemployment rate was 8.2% of the economically active population, down 0.2% on 
the quarter There were 2.61 million unemployed people, down 51,000 on the quarter. The employment rate for 
those aged from 16 to 64 was 70.%, up 0.3% on the quarter. There were 29.28 million people in employment aged 
16 and over, up 166,000 on the quarter. Total pay (including bonuses) rose by 1.4% on a year earlier, up 0.5% on 
the three months to March 2012. In May 2012 there were 1.60 million people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. This 
was up 8,100 compared with April and more than economists expected
Mervyn King over-ruled on QE economy boost 09.47: Mervyn King voted in favour of more quantitative easing at 
the Bank of England's policy-setting meeting earlier this month, newly-published minutes have shown.
It was a close call, with four members of the monetary policy committee calling for action, and five against.
The full story here.
'Bid target' ITV tops falling FTSE 09.07: ITV (ITV.L) looks set for a second day of share gains, helped again by bid 
rumours. There has been a flurry of speculation that a private equity firm like KKR or European broadcaster like 
ProSieben may launch a takeover bid for the broadcaster that boasts shows like the X Factor.
Liberum analysts have a 'buy' for ITV shares and this morning outlined a couple of good reasons why the company 
would be a takeover target: it is heavily cash generative and the company's recent £250 million bond buyback 
'lessens the bond buyback complications inherent in any takeover'.
This same bond buy-back, announced on Monday, saw UBS reiterating their 'buy' rating for ITV yesterday.
Goldman Sachs though were less impressed, yesterday downgrading the company from their 'conviction buy list' to 
a mere 'buy' due to uncertainty in the broader environment.
As well as garnering multiple 'buy' recommendations from analysts, ITV is a Citywire Top Stock held by both Derek 
Stuart, manager of the Artemis UK Special Situations Fund, and Nigel Thomas, who runs the AXA Framlington UK

Investors reminded to 'sell' Kesa 08.30: Shares that have gone ex-dividend are dominating the FTSE 100 fallers 
this morning, led by Severn Trent (SVT.L), United Utilities (UU.L) and Experian (EXPN.L) as they trade without their 
payout attractions.
One very real faller though, on the FTSE 250, is Kesa Electricals (KESA.L), the retailer operating across Europe.
Market Blog: investors on tenterhooks for bold Fed action
Although the company's final results to the end of April were in line with expectations with pre-tax profits of 59.0 
million (2011: 102.4 million) comments in Kesa's statement this morning have worried investors.
'The company worryingly refers to continued tough trading in Europe and changes to management in France,' said 
Freddie George of Seymour Pierce, noting that Kesa is a 'pure play' on a European consumer who is not likely to 
spend much amid the eurozone crisis.
George did however welcome the news that Alan Parker, currently chairman of Mothercare, will succeed David 
Newlands as chairman at Kesa. That's not enough for Seymour Pierce though, who still rate the shares a 'sell' with 
a price target of 45p; nor will it do for investors who sold this morning, taking Kesa's shares down 6.3% to 51.7p.
The FTSE 100 has started off lower at 5,575, a drop of 10 points. Markets across the rest of Europe are little

Ryanair has made an audacious third attempt at taking over Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag carrier.
The Irish low-cost carrier unveiled an all-cash offer of EUR1.3 per Aer Lingus share yesterday, valuing the airline's 
equity at EUR694m, or a 38.3 per cent premium to its closing stock price.
Since Aer Lingus's flotation in 2006, Ryanair has mounted two takeover bids for the flag carrier, but both failed after 
objections by the Irish government and the European Commission.
This week, the UK Competition Commission launched a probe into Ryanair's 29.8 per cent stake in Aer -Lingus 
over concerns that the shareholding may be damaging competition.
Ryanair said circumstances had "changed materially" since its first unsuccessful bid for Aer Lingus in 2006, 
highlighting consolidation involving European flag carriers and the Irish government's plan to sell its 25 per cent 
stake.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, said: "This offer represents a 
significant opportunity to combine Aer Lingus with Ryanair to form one strong Irish airline group capable of 
competing with Europe's other leading airline groups led by Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa."
In an attempt to persuade the competition authorities to clear the new bid, Ryanair pitched its offer as "pro-
consumer". It proposed to run its low-cost carrier separately from Aer Lingus, to maintain the two brands.
Aer Lingus declined to comment on Ryanair's new bid.
Gerald Khoo, analyst at Espirito Santo, said the antitrust issues may have moved in Ryanair's favour since 2006. 
"But it is far from clear Ryanair will be able to secure clearance from the authorities."
Ryanair makes third bid for Aer Lingus with EUR700m offer
Two analysts said the Irish government would probably reject Ryanair's new bid after declaring last year it would 
oppose the low-cost carrier buying the state's 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus. The government has held 
discussions about selling its stake to Etihad, the Gulf carrier that in May bought a 3 per cent stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair has been engaged in an acrimonious confrontation with Aer Lingus, demanding payment of a dividend and 
complaining about several issues.
Aer Lingus reported revenue of EUR1.3bn for the year to December 31, up 6 per cent, and pre-tax profit of 
EUR84.4m, compared with EUR27.2m in 2010. It had net cash of EUR445.9m at March 31.

BUDGET airline Ryanair has made a third bid to take over Aer Lingus, claiming its (EURO)694m (£560.6m) cash 
offer is the best chance for its rival to remain in Irish hands.
The offer of (EURO)1.30 per share represents a 46.7 per cent premium over Aer Lingus's six month average.
Ryanair believes there is a better chance of securing a deal with its bitter rival now than six years ago, when it failed 
to clinch the firm amid competition concerns.
The carrier, which already owns 29.82 per cent of Aer Lingus, has made no secret of its wish to buy it.
And chief executive Michael O'Leary reckons yesterday's offer presents no problem to regulators or shareholders. 
He pointed to the recent clearance of BA's takeover of BMI as an example of watchdogs allowing hard-up airlines to 
survive through consolidation.
"This offer is, we believe, the best way for Aer Lingus to continue to be owned, controlled and managed from 
Ireland for the benefit of Irish citizens and visitors," he said.
The firm added that the offer is a chance for the Irish government to get a good price for its 25 per cent holding, 
given recent interest from others including Etihad.

Body
Leading European budget airline Ryanair launched a surprise new takeover bid Tuesday for its Irish rival Aer Lingus 
and called on the cash-strapped Irish government to sell its key stake this time.
Dublin-based Ryanair said it would offer (EURO)1.30 ($1.65) per share, a 38 percent premium over Aer Lingus' 
current share price, in a deal that would value the airline at (EURO)694 million ($880.7 million).
Ryanair launched a hostile takeover of Aer Lingus in 2006 immediately after Ireland floated the state airline on the 
Irish and British stock exchanges. But the government refused to sell its remaining 25 percent stake and European 
Union regulators blocked the bid on competition grounds, saying a merged Ryanair-Aer Lingus operation would 
control more than 80 percent of Ireland's air passenger traffic.
Playing a long game of attrition, Ryanair since has remained Aer Lingus' largest shareholder with a 29.8 percent 
stake and sought, unsuccessfully, to influence boardroom decisions.
Aer Lingus and the government declined to respond Tuesday. Labor unions and opposition politicians appealed to 
the government not to sell to Ryanair, renowned as a ruthless cost-cutter with a relentless pursuit of building market 
share.
But in a statement Ryanair argued that the reasons for the government not to sell had evaporated since the demise 
of the Celtic Tiger economic boom in 2008, followed quickly by Ireland's international bailout in 2010.
As part of its debt-cutting negotiations with EU and International Monetary Fund lenders, the 15-month-old 
government of Prime Minister Enda Kenny has promised to sell state assets. It already has indicated plans to sell 
its Aer Lingus stake if the price and competition effects are right. Unlike their government predecessors, Kenny and 
Finance Minister Michael Noonan haven't ruled out a sale to Ryanair.
"Since the government's stake in Aer Lingus will now be sold," Ryanair said, "the important policy issue is whether it 
will be sold to a successful Irish-based company which will support growing Aer Lingus' traffic, lowering its unit 
Ryanair launches new takeover bid for Aer Lingus
costs and creating new jobs, or whether it will be sold to a non-Irish investor which will, Ryanair believes, lead to the 
inevitable break-up of Aer Lingus."
United Arab Emirates-based Etihad Airways earlier this year bought a 3 percent stake in Aer Lingus and has 
expressed interest in buying the government's stake. Ryanair said if Etihad or any other foreign airline did manage 
this, Ryanair would be willing to sell its stake to the successful bidder. Aer Lingus, meanwhile, is still pursuing a 
lawsuit against Ryanair seeking to force its rival to divest its holding on competition grounds.
But Ryanair said it's confident that, even if the government balked, it cannot stop Ryanair from reaching the 50 
percent share ownership needed to trigger an outright takeover. It noted that an Aer Lingus employee-controlled 
trust owned 15 percent of shares in 2006, but that trust was broken up in 2010, so this time it would be a matter of 
persuading individual shareholders to cash in their chips at a price that the airline's stock hasn't reached in four 
years.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said the new offer "represents a significant opportunity to combine Aer 
Lingus with Ryanair, to form one strong Irish airline group capable of competing with Europe's other major airline 
groups led by Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa." He forecast that a Ryanair-run Aer Lingus would grow its 
traffic from 9.5 million passengers last year to 14 million passengers within five years of acquisition. He reiterated 
Ryanair's promise to maintain Aer Lingus as a separate brand and business.
If successful, Ryanair would take control of an airline that recognizes labor unions, has much higher operating costs 
than Ryanair, and struggles to post profits regularly. Aer Lingus also is a trans-Atlantic operator with several direct 
routes to U.S. cities. And unlike Ryanair, which operates from London's other three major airports, Aer Lingus has 
valuable slots at Heathrow, a major European hub for connecting flights.
Although Ryanair has lost tens of millions on its slumping Aer Lingus investment to date, Ryanair can easily afford 
the new bid. Last month Ryanair reported record profits and said its cash reserves had grown 34 percent over the 
year to (EURO)2.7 billion ($3.4 billion).

Ryanair To Make $879 Mln Bid For Aer Lingus
Ryanair To Make $879 Mln Bid For Aer Lingus

(RTTNews) - Ireland-based Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) said Tuesday that it plans to make an all-cash 
offer of 1.30 euros per share for rival Aer Lingus Group plc (AERL.L), valuing that company at about 694 million 
euros or $879 million. This is the airline's third bid for Aer Lingus as part of its efforts to create a single Irish airline 
group.
The offer represents a 38.3 percent premium over Aer Lingus' closing stock price of 0.94 euros on Tuesday. The 
offer price is in addition to the dividend for each Aer Lingus share of about 0.03 euros declared by Aer Lingus on 
May 4 and payable on July 31.
Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, intends to make the offer through its wholly-owned subsidiary Coinside 
Ltd. The airline already hold a 29.82 percent stake in Aer Lingus, which it largely acquired in late 2006 and early 
2007.
Ryanair had first tried to acquire Aer Lingus in late 2006, but that bid was blocked by the European Commission on 
antitrust grounds. Earlier this month, the UK Competition Commission said it will probe Ryanair's minority 
shareholding in Aer Lingus under the UK's merger control legislation.
Ryanair said it believes its latest offer is the best way for Aer Lingus to continue to be owned, controlled and 
managed from Ireland for the benefit of Irish citizens and visitors. The company also said that "circumstances have 
changed materially" since its first unsuccessful bid for Aer Lingus in 2006.
Ryanair noted that the as the air transport market in Europe consolidates into five large airlines/groups led by Air 
France-KLM (AFLYY.PK), British Airways, Easyjet plc (EZJ.L), Deutsche Lufthansa AG (DLAKF.PK) and Ryanair, 
the long-term future of Aer Lingus can best be secured within one strong Irish airline group, led by Ryanair, under 
which Aer Lingus' fares and unit cost can be reduced and its recent traffic decline can be reversed.
The Irish government continues to hold 25 percent of Aer Lingus after the airline was privatized in 2006. However, 
the government plans to sell the stake as part of its commitment under the European Union/International Monetary 
Fund bailout to sell off a proportion of state-owned companies.
Ryanair noted that Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways recently acquired a 2.99 percent stake in Aer Lingus and is 
reportedly interested in buying the government's stake when it is put up for sale. Ryanair said that in the event 
Etihad acquired the government's stake, it would be willing to work with Etihad to grow Aer Lingus successfully.
Ryanair To Make $879 Mln Bid For Aer Lingus
Further, Ryanair noted that as Dublin Airport now operated at only about 50 percent capacity, greater capacity 
created significant availability throughout the day, thereby removing a barrier to any new entrants to the airport.
RYAAY closed Tuesday's trading at $30.81, up $0.43 or 1.42 percent on 136,444 shares. AERL.L closed Tuesday's 
trading at 0.93 euros, down 0.03 euros or 3.63 percent on 16,249 shares.

Miami consultants work on Dublin cruise strategy

Shipping consultants in Miami have begun work on a cruise tourism strategy for Dublin, and will deliver their report 
to Fáilte Ireland within six weeks.
The state tourism agency wants expert advice on the opportunities for the city to capitalise on the cruise market, as 
part of a four-year plan to double the number of cruise liners docking at Dublin Port annually. Bermello, Ajamil and 
Partners, which is based in Florida and was the master planner for the ambitious, but now abandoned, The World 
archipelago in Dubai, has been appointed to carry out the report.
More than 200 cruise ships visited Ireland last year. Half made a stopover in Dublin, while the remainder docked at 
ports in Cork, Waterford, Galway and Killybegs.
Cruise ship tourists spend around one and half times the amount that average tourists do, and cruise ship tourism 
was estimated to be worth more than EUR 20 million to the economy in 2010. That figure included direct spending 
by passengers and crew who disembarked at Irish ports, as well as port charges.
Fáilte Ireland Visit Dublin director Keith McCormack said that three in five of the cruise ships docking in Dublin were 
Carnival Corporation liners, and that most ships with an Irish stopover were en route from Scandinavia to the US.
"There is a very large market out there, so if the report shows opportunity, we would hope to develop a business 
plan around that," said McCormack. "The North American cruise market would be a growth market, and there's also 
Germany -- a million Germans took a cruise in 2009. We also need to get onto British cruise itineraries more, and 
we need to leverage more European businesses."
Fáilte Ireland -- into which Dublin Tourism was incorporated earlier this year -- is also working on the project, as are 
the Dublin Port Authority and Dublin City Council (DCC) from a planning perspective, according to McCormack.
"The infrastructure [of Dublin Port] is appropriate for the 100 cruise liners that dock there, but an extension of 
moorings up from the P&O ferries terminal there is being examined," he said.
Miami consultants work on Dublin cruise strategy
Fáilte Ireland is working on several other projects designed to attract tourists to the capital, including the recently-
launched Dubline, an ancient walking trail which runs from College Green in the city centre to Kilmainham. It is also 
seeking more partnership opportunities along the lines of a recent link-up with Heineken which will result in the 
provision of a 'Dublin golden pass' to visitors coming here for next year's European rugby cup finals.
An overseas marketing campaign using Aer Lingus and Ryanair as partners will also see eight festivals promoted 
during Dublin festival season in September and October.

Ryanair may be forced to sell its minority stake in Aer Lingus after a decision by the Office of Fair Trading to refer 
the matter to the Competition Commission.
The UK's main antitrust agency said yesterday that Ryanair's 29.8 per cent stake in its rival might provide it with 
material influence over Aer Lingus's commercial policy.
"There is a realistic prospect that its stake has resulted, or will result in, a substantial lessening of competition on a 
number of Ryanair and/or Aer Lingus routes between the UK and Ireland," the OFT said in a statement.
The watchdog began an inquiry in 2010 to determine whether Ryanair's purchase of a 29.8 per cent stake in Aer 
Lingus would lead to a substantial lessening in competition for consumers in the UK.
Ryanair challenged the decision to conduct the inquiry to the Court of Appeal but lost its case last month.
This has enabled the OFT to make the referral to the Competition Commission.
The commission, unlike the OFT, has the power to order companies to divest a minority stake if it finds that these 
enable the owner to influence the behaviour and policies of a target company in a way that harms competition.
In 2010, BSkyB was forced to sell part of a minority stake in ITV following such a finding by the commission.

Further doubt has been cast on the ability of Ryanair to hold on to its Aer Lingus stake after the UK's Office of Fair 
Trading (OFT) decision to refer Ryanair's shareholding for detailed investigation by the Competition Commission 
under the UK's merger control legislation.
Ryanair has had a 29pc share in Aer Lingus for the last five years and has made several unsuccessful attempts to 
grab a majority stake.
Aer Lingus' CEO, Christoph Mueller, said: "Today's decision by the OFT supports our view that Ryanair's 
shareholding in Aer Lingus is contrary to the interests of consumers and the majority of our shareholders. It is 
unacceptable that our principal competitor has been allowed to remain on our share register even though the 
European Commission blocked their hostile takeover almost five years ago. We look forward to cooperating with the 
Competition Commission in its investigation which we are confident will result in Ryanair being ordered to dispose 
of its shareholding."
But Ryanair has also welcomed today's decision. Ryanair said it is confident that the Competition Commission will 
agree with the EU Commission which found in 2007 - over five years ago - that since Ryanair has neither "de facto 
or de jure control" in Aer Lingus, it should not be forced to sell down its 29pc stake. "Ryanair regrets this waste of 
public time and resources, and the UK OFT's continued wild goose chase into a six year old failed merger, when 
neither the Irish Competition authorities, nor the EU Commission, had any objection to Ryanair's 29pc minority 
stake, which has conferred no influence or control upon Ryanair, since Aer Lingus has ignored Ryanair's advice 
and in a number of specific cases, denied Ryanair shareholder rights," a statement said.

Testliner prices declined by E25-30/tonne in June bringing the total decline from recent highs in April to E45-
50/tonne. Last week RISI noted that prices were expected to decline in June by "up to E20/tonne" and clearly the 
pricing environment has turned out more difficult. In addition, OCC prices declined by E10/tonne which leaves 
prices E20/tonne down from the recent peak. It would appear supply discipline is waning, given that testliner

Highlight: Intense local rivalry is putting pressure on Lot, writes Kamil Tchorek
Body
When Poland joined the EU in 2004, it brought the liberty Poles had been waiting for since the fall of communism in 
1989: the freedom to live abroad, and get there affordably.
An estimated 1m Poles emigrated to the UK and Ireland. Many have been commuting back to Poland ever since - 
for everything from good value dental care to better summer weather.
Thousands of others flit back and forth, working a few months aboard, then flying home. Europe's low-fare airlines - 
Ryanair, Budapest-headquartered Wizz Air, and others - have been the biggest beneficiaries of this migration.
The competition has proven to be an enormous challenge to Poland's lossmaking flag carrier, Lot Polish Airlines, 
which last year carried 4.6m passengers and posted a loss of 145.5m zlotys.
At a time when other central European carriers such as Hungary's Malev have gone bankrupt, Lot is fighting for 
survival, and the competition is growing.
The latest battle centres on the lucrative Warsaw market, Poland's largest with 9.3m passengers served in 2011, a 
7 per cent increase over 2010. Lot has long seen rivals such as Lufthansa siphoning well-heeled passengers from 
Warsaw to its own hubs.
Now it is likely to see a stronger challenge at the cheaper end of the market.
Ryanair pulled out of using Warsaw's Chopin airport in 2008 after a dispute over landing fees - Michael O'Leary, the 
airline's flamboyant chief executive, called it a "shocking airport".
Instead, the discount carrier put unpronounceable destinations on the map such as Bydgoszcz, Rzeszów and 
Wroclaw, its first Polish fleet base, tying secondary Polish cities directly to European destinations.
Competitors manage to fly rings round national carrier Airlines
That approach contrasts with Lot's hub-and-spoke system based on Warsaw as its main airport for foreign flights. 
Lot now faces a renewed low-cost challenge, thanks in part to the infrastructure upgrades prompted by the Euro 
2012 football championship.
The tournament provided the impetus for Warsaw's long-awaited low-cost airport at Modlin, a former air force base 
around 40km north-west of the city centre.
Ryanair begins flights from Modlin on July 16, launching eight new routes it hopes will carry about 700,000 
passengers a year. Eleven more routes will be added in the autumn.
Wizz Air has also moved to Modlin, even though the old airport boasts a refurbished terminal and a new rail link 
some 20 minutes from the centre.
"Wizz Air is moving to Warsaw Modlin to get lower landing fees," says Przemyslaw Przybylski, spokesman for 
Warsaw Chopin.
"But that is fine, Warsaw Chopin helped establish Modlin exactly to cater for the low-cost airlines which were 
overcrowding our facilities, and we remain a shareholder in the new airport."
Lot also faces change. The treasury ministry, which owns 68 per cent of the carrier, is hoping to privatise it this 
year.
Plans to sell a 50 per cent stake to fast-growing Turkish Airlines fell through this month, largely over Turkish 
concerns that EU rules would prevent it from taking full control of Lot.
The treasury may end up privatising Lot through the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and there are also hopes that Air 
China may take an interest.
As privatisation nears, Lot has been struggling to improve its bottom line. The carrier's net loss has been declining 
while its passenger numbers have been rising at an annual rate of 9 per cent.
The airline says its load factor (a measure of efficiency) was more than 76 per cent last year, in line with many 
competitors, and Lot predicts an operating profit of 52.5m zlotys for 2012, which would be its first profit since 2007.
In November, Lot will be the first European airline to receive Boeing's new B787 Dreamliner, one of the most fuel-
efficient airliners in the sky.
It will serve Lot's routes between Poland and North America.
This suggests that, with Lot facing competition closer to home, it will steadily build its intercontinental network.
"Lot knows Europe is getting extremely competitive, but it could carve out a niche running long-haul flights," says 
Stephen Furlong, an airline analyst at Davy, an Irish brokerage.
"The arrival of the Dreamliner definitely makes that a possibility."
The rivalry close to home looks to be getting even fiercer.
OLT Express, a new Polish airline, began operating domestic routes in April. Aiming to compete with Lot's internal 
flights and Poland's slow intercity rail services, it has cheap prices and frequent flights.
"This is a big country, people are feeling wealthier all the time, and they are still unsatisfied with the roads and 
railways," says Jaroslaw Frankowski, OLT's managing director.
"Lot didn't believe me when I pitched them the idea two years ago that low-fare domestic flights make total sense in 
Poland. Now they're having to cut fares, and they don't have enough fleet to compete with us."

Highlight: The ISEQ received a welcome lift from the bigger-than-expected bailout deal for Spain's ailing banks, 
which prompted investors to scoop up sold-down shares.
Body
The ISEQ received a welcome lift from the bigger-than-expected bailout deal for Spain's ailing banks, which 
prompted investors to scoop up sold-down shares.
By 12:30, the index was up 34.91 points to 3,083.08.
Over the weekend, the Eurogroup of EU finance ministers announced that Spain will apply for funding from the 
EFSF/ESM to recapitalise its banking sector. The Eurogroup announced that the aid will be sufficient to meet all 
possible capital requirements for Spain's banking sector as well as an additional safety margin. The funding 
package is expected to equal E100bn, but with the final amount contingent on the completed assessment of Spain's 
bank recapitalisation costs. The EU Commission currently expects Spain's government debt GDP ratio to rise to 
87pc in 2013. The potential E100bn of bank recapitalisation costs will add close to 10pc to the debt GDP ratio. 
However, unlike previous bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the new package for Spain will be linked to 
policy conditionality for the financial sector only. There will be no conditions linked to Spain's expenditure and 
taxation plans.
Shares in Aer Lingus were flat at E0.95 while Ryanair's stocks rose 4c to E4.04. World airline profits are expected 
to be dollar 3.0bn, unchanged from the last update in March. A fall in oil prices, stronger-than-expected growth in 
passenger traffic and a bottoming out of the freight market are driving some improvements in the profitability 
outlook. However, this is offset by the continued and deepening European sovereign debt crisis, which has led 
markets to expect a further deterioration and damage to economic growth, the adverse impact of which has been 
built into this forecast. In 2011, industry profits fell to dollar 7.9bn for a 1.3pc net profit margin. This year's projected 
dollar 3.0bn industry profit would yield a net profit margin of just 0.5pc. Saint-Gobain (SGO) announced on Friday 
last the acquisition of Celotex, a privately owned UK manufacturer of rigid board insulation. "The deal clearly is very 
small in the overall context of SGO (circa E90m revenues in a group with over E40bn). What is interesting is that 
ISEQ gets a lift from Spanish bank deal ISEQ Rises
the transaction brings SGO more directly into competition with Kingspan - not just geographically but also on 
product type. SGO's insulation products are mainly stone wool (mineral fibre, main brand is Isover) while 
Kingspan/Celotex would be non-fibrous insulation. Hence SGO is expanding in insulation in a category in which 
Kingspan is a specialist. The other operators of note in the UK rigid insulation sector are Irish-owned Xtratherm and 
Recticel (quoted Belgian business)," said Davy analyst, Flor O'Donoghue. Shares in Kingspan rose 8c to E6.80.

package is expected to equal E100bn, but with the final amount contingent on the completed assessment of Spain's 
bank recapitalisation costs. The EU Commission currently expects Spain's government debt GDP ratio to rise to 
87pc in 2013. The potential E100bn of bank recapitalisation costs will add close to 10pc to the debt GDP ratio. 
However, unlike previous bailouts for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the new package for Spain will be linked to

taxation plans.

markets to expect a further deterioration and damage to economic growth, the adverse impact of which has been 
built into this forecast. In 2011, industry profits fell to dollar 7.9bn for a 1.3pc net profit margin. This year's projected

Iata Warns Airlines of Worsening Eurozone Crisis and Oil Price Rise Risks

The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has warned the aviation industry that Europe's sovereign debt 
crisis will worsen and rising oil prices, coupled with political risk, could threaten to wipe out airlines' profits over the 
coming year.
"The biggest and most immediate risk, however, is the crisis in the eurozone," said Tony Tyler, director general at 
Iata during the Geneva-based group's annual meeting.
"If it evolves into a banking crisis we could face a continent-wide recession dragging the rest of the world and our 
profits down. The industry's profitability is balancing on a knife edge. If the bottom line worsens by even the 
equivalent of just 1 percent of revenue, our $3bn profit very quickly becomes a $3bn loss."
Iata, which regularly issues forecasts for an industry many consider an international business barometer, 
maintained this year's global airline profit forecast at $3bn, which is worth 0.5 percent of industry revenues, but the 
industry group said that despite the stable outlook European airlines could bear the brunt of profit loss.
"The rest of the world is seeing reduced profitability," said Tyler. "For European carriers, the business environment 
is deteriorating rapidly resulting in sizable losses, stemming from the worsening debt crisis in Europe."
While Iata noted that 2012 would be another challenging year and forecast revenues of $631bn, the high price of oil 
will be the reason for the meagre 0.5 percent net margin.
"[The $3bn profit and $631bn revenue] projection comes with some serious downside risks," said Tyler. "The high 
price of oil is among the main reasons for our anaemic global profitability. Oil prices have softened slightly. But we 
still expect an average of $110 per barrel. That will leave us with a fuel bill of $207 billion-almost equal to the GDP 
of the Philippines or the Czech Republic. It will account for a third of our costs. And political risks could easily push 
the price higher."
Turbulent Times Ahead
In 2012, many airlines forecast profit slumps over the next year on fuel price rises.
Iata Warns Airlines of Worsening Eurozone Crisis and Oil Price Rise Risks
Europe's largest low-cost airline Ryanair warned the market of a dramatic profit slump for the next year, despite 
beating analyst expectations with a 25 percent surge in profits for the 12 months leading up to 31 March 2012, only 
last month.
"Recession, austerity, currency concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases ... will make it difficult to repeat 
this year's record results," said chief executive Michael O'Leary. "Any increase in fares will only partially offset 
higher fuel costs."
"There's a poor environment, it's the fourth year of this, and repeating [fare growth of] 16 percent is not going to 
happen," added chief financial officer Howard Millar. 
"Ryanair is not as worried about the fallout of Greece's political crisis as the fact that the eurozone is suffering its 
fourth year of poor economic performance. Greece is very small for us. We would be more concerned about places 
like Spain, its high unemployment and plans to raise taxes."
Ryanair is an example in a long line of airlines that have voiced concerns, issued profit warnings or issued actual 
drops in profits, following the rising cost of fuel. 
IBTimes UK revealed that while many airlines use hedging, the act of entering a range of financial product contracts 
or hedges that look to protect them against certain market price movements, in order to help manage the risk of 
rising fuel costs, this was not enough to mitigate losses.
In a report titled The State of Airline Fuel Hedging & Risk Management, by Mercatus Energy Advisors and Airline 
Economics, which is comprised of data from 24 different airlines, a majority of airlines have only implemented a 
hedging programme for 21 percent and 40 percent of its fuel for 2012, in a bid to mitigate losses from rising oil 
prices.
In the week preceding the report, IBTimes UK revealed that hedging programmes at a number of airlines, including 
Air-France KLM was not enough to guard the groups against soaring oil prices.
While the Mercatus and Airline Economics survey does not have year-on-year comparative data, the article 
in IBTimes UK revealed the changing landscape in aviation hedging practices over the last four years.
Oil Prices To Regain Flight
Oil prices fell to a 16-month low amid a darkening outlook for economies in Europe, the United States and China.
Furthermore, Shell's CEO Peter Voser said at the World Gas Conference on Monday that oil prices in the second 
half of this year will fall as demand reacts to the slowing global economy and international political tensions ease.
Nymex crude oil currently stands at $85.60 per barrel, while Brent is at $100.45 per barrel.
Despite prices trading well below this year's highs of $128 per barrel, analysts and key industry officials predict that 
oil should rise back up over the second half of 2012.
Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said at a conference in Australia last month he wanted Brent oil prices to trade at 
"around $100," but oil prices have largely been in retreat mode, hitting $99.47 Brent Friday.
However, analysts at JP Morgan have predicted Brent oil prices to average $120 per barrel in Q3 2012 and $125 
per barrel in Q4 2012, on more potential geopolitical risk, non-OPEC supply disruptions, refineries returning from 
maintenance and balance tightening materially from here.

Body
IAG, the parent firm of British Airways and Iberia, has been hit by Spain's economic woes in the last month, 
undermining the strength in its long-haul London routes.
IAG said yesterday that its traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometres, rose 6.6 per cent last month versus 
May 2011, while passenger load factor - a measure of how well it fills its planes - was up 0.5 percentage points at 
78.6 per cent.
"Underlying market conditions at our London Heathrow hub continue to be firm, particularly in long haul premium," 
the company said.
"However, commercial performance at our Madrid hub has deteriorated further due to the ongoing effects of the 
Spanish and wider Eurozone macroeconomic conditions and, the after-effects of prolonged industrial action."
IAG said its first and business-class travel - the most profitable part of its passenger business - rose 1.7 per cent, 
while non-premium traffic was up 7.5 per cent. It added that trends in June appeared to be stronger than those in 
May.
Traffic at Iberia, which made an operating loss of (EURO)170m (£137m) in the first three months of the year fell 1.8 
per cent last month, IAG said.
Meanwhile, capacity cuts at Air France-KLM contributed to a 0.2 per cent fall in passenger traffic in May.
The airline also blamed four extra public holidays in France for the slide. Its cargo revenues fell 8.8 per cent on a 
year ago, and are 7.3 per cent lower in the year to date.
Airline traffic growth is knocked off course by Eurozone worries
And budget airline Ryanair said that while passenger numbers rose five per cent to 7.5m last month, thanks to 
expanding routes, its load factor dropped one percentage point to 81 per cent.

Highlight: Ryanair, a low cost airline, has reported a profit after tax, or PAT, of E503 million, or 34.10 cents per 
basic share, for the year ended March 31, 2012, compared to E401 million, or 26.97 cents per basic share, for the 
year ended March 31, 2011. The company has provided guidance for the fiscal year 2013.
Body
Revenue for the year ended March 31, 2012 was E4.32 billion, compared to E3.63 billion for the year ended March 
31, 2011. Passengers travelled for the year ended March 31, 2012 were 75.8 million passengers, compared to 72.1 
million passengers for the year ended March 31, 2011. The company expects traffic in fiscal year 2013 to grow by 
5% to over 79 million passengers. The first half traffic is ecpected to grow by 7% while the second half is expected 
to grow by 3%. Fuel bill is expected to increase by E320 million in fiscal 2013 with most of this increase skewed into 
the first half, and as a result expect to report a first quarter profit fall due to these higher prices. The company 
expects that any increase in fares will only partially offset higher fuel costs, and accordingly guide net profit in fiscal 
2013 subject to final yield outturn will be lower than fiscal 2012 in a range of E400 million to E440 million.

Ryanair  was left behind by a London market rally on worries that falling oil prices might not translate to higher 
earnings.
Budget airlines have outperformed flag carriers this year because they fix a greater proportion of their fuel bills in 
advance, which gave them a competitive advantage, said JPMorgan Cazenove. "Falling fuel prices will likely have 
the opposite effect," it said.
Jet fuel was already trading at close to Ryanair's hedging price for 2013, having fallen 18 per cent in two months, 
the broker said.
Yet Ryanair shares have risen 10.3 per cent over the past 12 months, compared with a 37 per cent drop for British 
Airways owner IAG . At £4.65bn, Ryanair's market valuation is nearly £2bn higher than IAG's.
"Ryanair and easyJet  are highly cyclical airlines, near 100 per cent exposed to Europe, with their biggest cost 
[fuel] outside of their control," said JPMorgan. "Recent earnings performance is impressive [but] we believe 
sentiment has overshot, and become too negative for the legacy carriers."
Ryanair's London-listed shares fell 1.3 per cent to EUR4.00 after JPMorgan downgraded to "underweight". IAG 
rose 1.9 per cent to 144½p and easyJet was up 2.5 per cent to 497p.
The wider market showed its biggest advance in six months, lifting the FTSE 100 by 2.4 per cent, or 123.92 points, 
to 5,384.11.
Banks led the way, with Barclays surging 8.2 per cent to 187.8p. Royal Bank of Scotland , which was trading post 
a ten-for-one share consolidation, rose 6.7 per cent to 213.2p.
A Citigroup upgrade to "buy" led Man Group to rally 7.1 per cent to 80.9p. A 19 per cent prospective dividend yield 
helped offset the risk of further earnings downgrades, it argued.
Ryanair fails to take off in rally amid worries over fuel prices LONDON
Citi set a 90p target on the hedge fund manager based on 4 per cent growth in assets under management this year 
and no performance fee earnings from its flagship AHL fund until 2014. "For us to cut again, we would need to see 
negative returns and flows into 2013," Citi said. "This is unlikely, in our view."
Precious metals miners led the risers as an agreement by G7 leaders to coordinate policy action pushed gold to a 
four-week high.  Randgold Resources rose 7.7 per cent to £59.80, African Barrick Gold  added 14.5 per cent to 
400.2p and Centamin  advanced 11.1 per cent to 72.4p.
RBC was advising clients to buy gold producers, as "the catalysts that triggered the 2011 gold price rallies are still 
in place". Central bank buying, the eurozone crisis and expectations of another round of quantitative easing in the 
US should mean gold would trade higher in the second half, it said.
Petropavlovsk  rose 9.7 per cent to 425.6p after UBS added the Russian gold miner to its "buy" list.
While cost inflation would hurt earnings, the recent weakness in the rouble and a stronger short-term outlook for 
gold presents a sweet spot for the company, UBS said. The broker also noted a "rock bottom" valuation of 5.4 times 
2012 earnings, compared with 11.9 times earnings for the gold sector.
Premier Oil gained 7.4 per cent to 353.2p after announcing an oil discovery at the Carnaby exploration well in the 
North Sea, though volumes were towards the lower end of the guided range. Minority stakeholders in Carnaby, 
Cairn Energy rose 5 per cent to 289.7p and Nautical Petroleum was up 3.2 per cent to 269p.
Among the fallers, Tate & Lyle lost 1.6 per cent to 643p as downgrades followed the ingredients maker's results last 
week. Canaccord Genuity cut its earnings forecasts for the current year by about 7 per cent after a meeting with 
management, with the broker predicting that corn price headwinds and weakness in macroexposed industrial starch 
and US ethanol markets would restrain growth.
InterContinental Hotels  slipped back 0.8 per cent to £14.70 following last week's spike higher, which came after 
activist investor Nelson Peltz declared a stake. InterContinental management was this week on a US roadshow.
Retailers slipped following a rain-disrupted Jubilee weekend, with Dixons Retail down 4.7 per cent to 12.8p and 
Argos owner Home Retail Group off 2.7 per cent to 71.5p.
Supergroup  dropped 5 per cent to 285.9p following its ejection from the FTSE 250 index as part of the latest 
quarterly review.
Among small caps, newspaper publisher Mecom dived 48 per cent to 76p on a warning of weak advertising sales. 
Yell Group rose 5.7 per cent to 1.7p on a Citi upgrade to "hold".

Highlight: Ryanair, an airline company, has confirmed the early cancelation of 82 weekly flights to Rhodes and 
Kos.
Body
Ryanair will now close 11 routes to Kos and 13 routes to Rhodes, one month before the end of the summer season, 
resulting in the loss of over 23,000 tourists and over E18 million in tourism revenues to the local economy, after 
DETAP and the Mayor of Kos reneged on an agreement with Ryanair to promote these flights internationally. 
Ryanair's Stephen McNamara said, "Ryanair originally intended to operate 11 Kos routes and 13 Rhodes routes to 
the end of the summer and these would have delivered over 23,000 passengers during October, providing 
increased tourism spending and sustaining local jobs. "However, DETAP and the Mayor of Kos have reneged on an 
agreement with Ryanair to jointly promote our flights and we have now been forced to cancel flights from 2 October. 
"DETAP and the Mayor of Kos should now explain to Rhodes and Kos residents, why they have now refused to 
partner with the only airline interested in bringing new passengers, new jobs and millions in tourism revenues to the 
region."

Perhaps it was the historic visit of the Olympic Torch to Dublin's Streets or perhaps it was on the back of rallies 
around Europe.
The end result was that the Dublin Stock Market lifted by over 50 points by lunch-time yesterday and the overall 
ISEQ index closed a healthy 73.46 points higher at 3,035.25.
As the London market returned after a four day holiday, Dublin stocks rolled back the sea of red seen on screens 
on Tuesday with some significant gains yesterday.
Leading the rally were CRH which gained 68c to E13.67, Dragon which rose 48c to E6.48 and Ryanair which 
gained 7c to E4.00.
Grafton Group which placed its heavily loss-making Atlantic Homecare division in examinership today gained 1c to 
E2.76 by lunchtime but closed unchanged at E2.75. . There was a positive note on Grafton from Davy 
Stockbrokers.
"While it remains to be seen how this plays out - the examinership process can last for up to 100 days - this is a 
positive announcement from Grafton and another example of its self-help measures," analyst Flor O'Donoghue 
said. "Even if the outcome is just that the Atlantic business closes down for good, we believe Grafton could be 
saving up to E3m per year, such is the extent of the losses of the business. As we are forecasting that Grafton's 
trading profit this year will be under E60m, Atlantic's level of losses are material in a group context, even though the 
business accounts for under 3pc of group revenues," the Davy analyst concluded.

Boeing has expressed doubts that it can provide Ryanair with a 200-seat aircraft by removing the two toilets at the 
rear of the US manufacturer's 737 narrow-body jet, writes Andrew Parker .
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's vocal chief executive, is extremely keen to increase the number of seats on each of the 
airline's Boeing 737-800s from 189 to 195 or more by having only one toilet at the front of the aircraft.
Jim Albaugh, head of Boeing's commercial aircraft division, described Ryanair as a "great customer" but said that 
he did not think the jet certification authorities would allow the manufacturer to stop installing toilets at the back of 
the 737.

Body
How many airlines does Europe need? Certainly not 40, providing 8.5 per cent more seat capacity in 2011 
compared with 2007. One theory says that the region could live with three flag carriers (Lufthansa, International 
Airlines Group and Air France-KLM), a couple of budget airlines (Ryanair and easyJet) and, perhaps, a few niche 
players. But while consolidation talk is plentiful, the actual pace of airline rationalisation remains fairly stately.
There are several reasons. Antitrust policies do not help - at least from an investor if not a passenger perspective. 
Of the four mergers blocked by European regulators over the past eight years, two have involved airlines: Ryanair's 
bid for Aer Lingus , and the proposed combination of Greek carriers Aegean and Olympic .
Meanwhile, big flag carriers, faced with high fuel costs and depressed demand, have worries of their own, limiting 
capacity to absorb smaller fry. True, Lufthansa, in the throes of cost-cutting but with a solid balance sheet, has 
signalled tentative interest in Portugal's TAP. But IAG is still digesting Spain's Iberia and working through the BMI 
purchase. And Air France-KLM, long touted as a potential purchaser for Alitalia, needs to focus on its own 
restructuring. That leaves expansion-minded Middle East carriers, such as Etihad and Emirates. But they are more 
intent on bolstering their own operations than sorting out Europe's woes: Etihad's 29 per cent of Air Berlin, for 
example, provides access to a useful European feeder service.
Plainly, it would be helpful if smaller carriers could combine among themselves - an idea being discussed among 
Balkans airlines but yet to crystallise. Ultimately, though, credit withdrawal pressures may be required to achieve 
rationalisation. Last year, these pushed Malev and Spanair out of the skies. It could be an even tougher winter 
ahead.

Ryanair launches a third takeover bid for Aer Lingus
Ryanair launches a third takeover bid for Aer Lingus

Highlight: Budjet airline Ryanair has made an all cash offer of Eu 1.30 per share for Aer Lingus.
Body
Ryanair has offered 1.30 euros per Aer Lingus share in all cash takeover bid for the Irish flag carrier. The bid values 
Aer Lingus at 694 million euros.
Ryanair already owns 30% of Aer Lingus. This is Ryanair&s third attempt to buy the rest of the shares of its main 
competitor in six years. It launched two unsuccessful bids in 2006 and 2008.
In May 2012 a UK Court permitted the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to investigate Ryanair&s 30% shareholding in 
Aer Lingus. The OFT investigation started in September 2010, but was blocked in July this year under Ryanair&s 
objection that it was &out of time&. Ryanair acquired its stake in 2006 as part of an unsuccessful takeover bid. The 
European Commission blocked the bid in 2007 because of its potential effect on UK customers and aviation 
competition.
"It is unacceptable that our principal competitor has been allowed to remain as a significant shareholder on our 
share register even though the European Commission blocked their hostile takeover almost five years ago", 
Christoph Mueller, chief executive, Aer Lingus, commented at the time.
Aer Lingus has urged stakeholders to take no action and says it will make a statement in due course. Aer Lingus 
shares rose more than 18.22% in early trading since Ryanair's offer.

The UK Supreme Court has refused to grant Ryanair leave to appeal against the recent judgement by the UK Court 
of Appeal that the Office of Fair Trading is "in time" to investigate Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus.
Aer Lingus this morning said that the Supreme Court's decision brings to an end Ryanair's challenge to the validity

"The OFT can now proceed swiftly to complete its investigation into Ryanair's shareholding which is contrary to the 
interests of consumers and the majority of Aer Lingus' shareholders," Aer Lingus said.
The ruling puts added pressure on Ryanair to sell its minority stake in Aer Lingus. The OFT can now proceed swiftly 
to complete its investigation into Ryanair's shareholding which - it is alleged - is contrary to the interests of

Highlight: Aer Lingus says Ryanair's offer "undervalues" the airline.
Body
Aer Lingus' board has responded to Ryanair's latest takeover bid by saying the offer by Ryanair "undervalues" Aer 
Lingus.
Aer Lingus states it has raised its profitability up by Eu 130 million since 2009 and its balance sheet includes cash 
of in excess of Eu1 billion at 31 March 2012, which positions it well for the future.
The board also points out that there was "significant uncertainty" whether the deal would close, and cited the 
European Commission's block of the previous two takeover bids by Ryanair. Ryanair presently has a 30% stake in 
Aer Lingus.
Ryanair has offered 1.30 euros per Aer Lingus share, which values the Irish flag carrier at 694 million euros. Aer 
Lingus shares have increased by 18,22% since yesterday.

Body
The ISEQ's slow but steady recovery continued today with stocks making modest gains though held back by fears 
over Spain's banks putting the brakes on share buying.
The index rose 39.60 points to 3,143.32.
Global equity markets jumped on signs of a new strategy to deal with Europe's debt crisis, but bond prices held on 
to gains on concerns about Spain's banking system. U.S. and European stocks extended gains, with Spanish 
stocks trimming heavy losses, on mounting hopes the European Central Bank will help ailing euro zone banks, 
traders said. Speculation also centred on a meeting of the European Commission on Wednesday when the 
commission will set out its economic strategy for the euro zone and possibly shift its emphasis from austerity to 
growth.
CRH peer, Wolseley has reported that like for like group sales for the third quarter (to April end) have grown by 
3.8pc which compares to 4.5pc in Q1 and 4.7pc in Q2. Operating profit in the quarter was up 10pc to £139m. "While 
this was broadly in line with expectations, it may be a slight disappointment with the strength in the US being offset 
by weakness in Europe," said Goodbody's Robert Eason. "These results show that while the US market is strong it 
is offset by weakening trends in Europe. This dynamic, coupled with a weak outlook for US infrastructure, underpins 
our cautious stance on CRH." Shares in CRH rose 32c to E14.50. Elsewhere, Kerry Group's shares climbed 28c to 
E34.28 and Ryanair gained 6c to E4.21. Paddy Power's stocks climbed 23c to E51.48. The Australian Department 
of Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy has this morning released its interim report into the Review 
of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The review is due before the final report (expected by mid-2012) to allow for 
submissions from interested parties. The report makes a number of recommendations including that in-play betting 
should be permitted in online if authorised by the state regulatory authority and the relevant sports controlling body. 
The report suggests that all in-play betting, except for what it terms microbets (i.e. next point in tennis, very high 
ISEQ rebounds as crisis fix hopes rise ISEQ Up
frequency bets), should be allowed. "Overall, while this morning's report is only an interim one and no decision has 
been made, we view the recommendations as a step in the right direction for the regulated online market in 
Australia. We recently estimated that in-play betting could conservatively increase Paddy Power's group core 
earnings (EBIT) by 3.5pc to 5pc. Any introduction of tournament poker would be a further small positive," said 
analyst, Gavin Kelleher. United Drug is the main supplier to Boots in Ireland, which has a network of around 60 
stores of a total retail population of 1500, so this change will have minimal impact on United Drug from a volume 
perspective. According to reports, Boots plans to cut the price of 10 of its most expensive drugs by an average of 
25pc. Shares in United Drug rose 4c to E2.28.

The ISEQ's slow but steady recovery continued today with stocks making modest gains though held back by fears 
over Spain's banks putting the brakes on share buying.
The index rose 39.60 points to 3,143.32.
Global equity markets jumped on signs of a new strategy to deal with Europe's debt crisis, but bond prices held on 
to gains on concerns about Spain's banking system. U.S. and European stocks extended gains, with Spanish 
stocks trimming heavy losses, on mounting hopes the European Central Bank will help ailing euro zone banks, 
traders said. Speculation also centred on a meeting of the European Commission on Wednesday when the 
commission will set out its economic strategy for the euro zone and possibly shift its emphasis from austerity to 
growth.
CRH peer, Wolseley has reported that like for like group sales for the third quarter (to April end) have grown by 
3.8pc which compares to 4.5pc in Q1 and 4.7pc in Q2. Operating profit in the quarter was up 10pc to £139m. "While 
this was broadly in line with expectations, it may be a slight disappointment with the strength in the US being offset 
by weakness in Europe," said Goodbody's Robert Eason. "These results show that while the US market is strong it 
is offset by weakening trends in Europe. This dynamic, coupled with a weak outlook for US infrastructure, underpins 
our cautious stance on CRH." Shares in CRH rose 32c to E14.50. Elsewhere, Kerry Group's shares climbed 28c to 
E34.28 and Ryanair gained 6c to E4.21. Paddy Power's stocks climbed 23c to E51.48. The Australian Department 
of Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy has this morning released its interim report into the Review 
of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The review is due before the final report (expected by mid-2012) to allow for 
submissions from interested parties. The report makes a number of recommendations including that in-play betting 
should be permitted in online if authorised by the state regulatory authority and the relevant sports controlling body. 
The report suggests that all in-play betting, except for what it terms microbets (i.e. next point in tennis, very high 
ISEQ rebounds as crisis fix hopes rise ISEQ Up
frequency bets), should be allowed. "Overall, while this morning's report is only an interim one and no decision has 
been made, we view the recommendations as a step in the right direction for the regulated online market in 
Australia. We recently estimated that in-play betting could conservatively increase Paddy Power's group core 
earnings (EBIT) by 3.5pc to 5pc. Any introduction of tournament poker would be a further small positive," said 
analyst, Gavin Kelleher. United Drug is the main supplier to Boots in Ireland, which has a network of around 60 
stores of a total retail population of 1500, so this change will have minimal impact on United Drug from a volume 
perspective. According to reports, Boots plans to cut the price of 10 of its most expensive drugs by an average of 
25pc. Shares in United Drug rose 4c to E2.28.

Court of Appeal agrees to hear case
Breakthrough for airports operator
Body
BAA has won the right to appeal against an order to sell Stansted in the first big break for the airport operator for 
two years in its fight against the ruling. BAA, which is owned by the Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial, went to 
the Court of Appeal yesterday seeking a chance to overturn a decision by the Competition Appeal Tribunal in 
February to uphold a 2009 Competition Commission order that BAA sell Stansted, Gatwick and one of its Scottish 
airports.
An investigation by the commission had found that BAA's grip on airports in the south-east and Scotland stymied 
competition, at the expense of airlines and travellers, and decided that separate ownership of London's three and 
Scotland's two big airports was the appropriate remedy.
BAA complied with the disposal order by selling Gatwick in 2009 and Edinburgh last month .
However, it has resisted selling Stansted and has made multiple appeals since 2009 - including through a judicial 
review that year and an application to the Supreme Court in 2010.
In the latest appeal BAA plans to argue that the original ruling has been misinterpreted, and that Heathrow and 
Stansted compete with each other only to a limited extent.
It will also contest the commission's approach to assessing the cost to BAA of a forced sale.
The company said yesterday: "We are pleased that permission to appeal has been granted and look forward to 
presenting our arguments before the Court of Appeal."
The Competition Commission said it looked forward to restating its case.
BAA wins right to fight sell-Stansted order
The Court of Appeal has not yet given a date for a hearing but a ruling is not expected before autumn.
If BAA is forced to sell, analysts predict a price   of at least £1bn, or 11 times Stansted's earnings last year . That 
figure is lower than the multiple Edinburgh commanded, in part because Stansted is a regulated asset, limiting its 
annual returns.
But Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Charles Stanley, pointed out that that was not Stansted's only problem.
"It's a shrinking airport and the same is not true of Edinburgh," he said.
Stansted's declining traffic was one of BAA's reasons for arguing last year that circumstances had changed 
significantly since the 2009 decision and the remedies should be adjusted.
Olivia Peters, an analyst with RBC Capital Management, said the Court of Appeal ruling came "as a bit of a surprise 
since BAA have already appealed and they lost".
She added: "Given Heathrow and Stansted do not compete with each other - they have a completely different 
customer base - it seems a fairer decision."
Ryanair, the low-cost airline that is Stansted's biggest customer, condemned the court's decision.
Ryanair said: "This seventh appeal will further delay the sale of Stansted, proving yet again that the BAA has no 
regard for passengers, competition or tourism as it attempts to retain its stranglehold over London traffic."

The main Dublin shares index continued its rebound this morning as fears over the Greek crisis eased somewhat.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 25.88 points to 3,117.75.
European equities rose, cheered by opinion polls suggesting Greece's pro-bailout parties may be able to form a 
government committed to staying in the euro, but a selloff in Spanish banks underlined the region's remaining 
problems. The weekend polls went some way towards reassuring investors worried about a possible Greek euro 
zone exit in case of a leftist victory in the June 17 election - an event with unpredictable and potentially costly 
contagion risks for the other economies in the currency bloc and beyond.
Chinese imports of OCC (packaging materials) rose by 14.2pc in April compared to the same month last year, 
leaving imports 13.1pc higher for the first four months of the year. OCC prices rose by almost E40/tonne between 
early January and late April this year. This was due to the increase in Chinese demand, combined with stronger 
demand in Europe. This in turn has led to some weakness in recycled containerboard prices in Germany and 
France. Prices have weakened by E10-15/tonne in May in response to weaker Chinese demand and slower growth 
in Europe. The weakness in Chinese demand is being attributed to a lack of shipping capacity between Europe and 
China combined with de-stocking by Chinese traders. Shares in Smurfit Kappa rose 5c to E5.50. Origin has issued 
a trading update for the nine months to April 30th 2012. Agri-services revenues rose 7pc year-to-date on an 
underlying basis; on a reported basis, the increase was 2pc. Total group revenues fell in the period as a result of 
the food segment moving to the associate line. Given the change in the shape of the group over the past couple of 
years, the second half now accounts for over 85pc of annual profits. Positive demand-led growth, backed up by 
higher autumn plantings and excellent growing conditions, led to strong out-turn for its on-farm agronomy services 
business. Poland performed strongly in the quarter despite significant crop losses due to winter kill. Business-to-
business agri inputs performed well in the quarter on the back of a quieter first half. The company notes that

primary producers delayed their purchasing commitments until closer to the application period. The integration of 
Carr's Fertilisers is on track and should be completed by August 2012. Feed volumes were lower year-on-year, 
reflecting the excellent fodder availability. Origin's shares fell 5c to E3.45. In Britain, the BAA is appealing the sale 
of Stansted in the Royal Courts of Justice. "The sale of Stansted would be positive for Ryanair which has two-thirds 
of the traffic there and would be needed by any new operator to stimulate growth. With rising airport charges, traffic 
is down c.30pc from peak," said Davy Research. Shares in Ryanair rose 8c to E4.17.

News analysis
Airport operator wants to appeal against 2009 order to offload asset, writes Rose Jacobs
Body
Airport operators normally have a horror of delays. But more time in the departure lounge is just what BAA hopes to 
win at the Royal Courts of Justice today.
The UK's biggest airport owner is making its case for the right to appeal, for a second time, against a 2009 
Competition Commission ruling that it sell Stansted airport, arguing market conditions have changed since. BAA 
says Stansted would not compete with Heathrow in today's market place, even if it were under a different 
ownership.
If granted, an appeal would be BAA's last chance to hang on to an asset it has fought for years to keep . If rejected, 
London's third-biggest airport could change hands by the end of the summer, at a price analysts put at £900m-
£1.4bn.
The top of that range is set by Edinburgh Airport, which BAA's owner Ferrovial sold for almost 17 times earnings 
this spring in another regulator-ordered sale. That suggests this is not a bad time to sell an airport. But there are 
reasons to believe Stansted may trade for something closer to the multiple Ferrovial achieved when it sold Gatwick 
airport in 2009: 10 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
That is partly because, like Gatwick, Stansted is a regulated asset, meaning the fees it charges airlines and retailers 
are linked to the consumer price index. That hedge against inflation is one reason pension funds are expected to 
look closely at the opportunity. But it limits returns, too.
BAA fights to ground Stansted sale plan
Stansted's biggest customer, Ryanair, could prove a problem. The low-cost carrier constitutes three-quarters of 
traffic and insists it will fly from other bases if landing fees rise - which they would do if an owner wanted to drive 
volume growth through investment.
The trouble is that, with Stansted operating at only half capacity, increasing passenger traffic could prove an 
important part of any investment case, particularly if private equity is involved, seeking higher returns in a shorter 
period of time than other buyers.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair chief executive, has said he was prepared to take a stake in Stansted by joining a 
consortium bidding for the airport , but one banker who has worked on a number of airport deals thinks it would take 
a significant stake to induce him to prioritise Stansted's needs over his airline's.
Another drag on the price might have more to do with bidders than the airport - or rather, with the lack of one 
particular bidder.
Global Infrastructure Partners, the world's biggest infrastructure-focused fund, successfully bid for Edinburgh 
Airport. It also owns London City and Gatwick airports, and people close to the auction say the price was probably 
justified in part by savings GIP thinks it can derive from owning several UK airports.
But it owns too many London airports to go for Stansted. One London-based analyst said GIP was willing to pay 
more for Edinburgh because it was better positioned than rivals to fund the transaction with debt. "The fact that GIP 
aren't bidding will probably mean the multiple will be lower because others wouldn't necessarily have access to the 
sort of debt financing they do," he said.
But Stansted's woes could be overplayed, including the possibility Ryanair would pull many routes if fees rose. A 
lack of London alternatives could stymie that plan, said the analyst.
Nor is uncertainty over aviation policy necessarily a big concern, says Douglas McNeill at Charles Stanley. The 
government might consider expanding Heathrow - which would require an awkward about-face; building a hub in 
the Thames Estuary; or making better use of London's other airports. The latter could inflate future returns for 
Stansted, but ministers do not plan to choose a path until next spring.
Even so, Mr McNeill would not advocate delay. Should BAA be forced to sell, he forecasts a pricetag of at least 
£1bn. "I don't see much reason to think that things will get better," he says. "I think they might even get worse."

Ireland's summer has finally appeared from behind a cloud, but fearing that its appearance might be short-lived, 
thousands of families will head for sunnier climes in the coming months.
More than 22.7 million passengers travelled through Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports last year, according to the 
Dublin Airport Authority (DAA).
If, like them, you intend to take to the skies in the coming weeks, take care when booking your trip. Additional fees 
and charges can turn what initially seemed like a good deal into a financial nightmare.
**Come fly with me**
Caroline Curneen, of the European Consumer Centre in Dublin, said that consumers should look beyond the 
headline price when booking a flight this summer, as added extras could significantly increase the cost of a trip.
"Airlines are extremely clever at 'de-packaging' things, and unbundling their offer," said Ann Fitzgerald, chief 
executive of the National Consumer Agency (NCA).
When you book a flight, taxes and fees will usually account for a significant portion of the cost. However, sometimes 
you may see a 'no taxes' or 'taxes only' offer. This occurs where airlines, on a promotional basis, absorb the cost of 
airline taxes or charge only the taxes and no fare.
Airlines typically apply an administration charge or a handling charge to certain card bookings. For example, Aer 
Lingus and Ryanair both apply a EUR 6 fee.
According to the Aer Lingus website, the EUR 6 charge applies per person, per flight. However, bookings using 
Visa Electron are not subject to the administration fee. Ryanair also levies the EUR 6 charge per person, per flight. 
However, passengers using the Ryanair Cash Passport, a prepaid card, to make a booking can escape the charge.
Your Money: Be vigilant about travel costs
**Bags and more**
Making a family trip, especially with young children, requires a lot of baggage. And stuff requires space, meaning 
more luggage and a bigger bill. "It's not conceivable for everyone to travel with just hand luggage," Curneen said.
Aer Lingus charges between EUR 15 and 20 for a checked bag on a short-haul flight, if booked online. The cost 
rises to between EUR 30 and EUR 40 if you check in the bag when you arrive at the airport.
With Ryanair, it costs between EUR 15 and EUR 50 to check a bag in online. The higher fee applies for a second 
checked bag on certain high season flights. If you wait until you reach the airport to check a bag in, you will be 
charged between EUR 60 and EUR 150.
Be mindful of luggage limits, as excess baggage fees per kilo will further increase the cost of your trip. "Keep within 
the baggage limits, as the penalties for not complying are extortionate and severely jack up the cost of your 
holiday," Curneen said.
On Aer Lingus's short-haul routes, 20kg of baggage is allowed per person. Thereafter, excess baggage is charged 
at EUR 9 per kilo if paid online or EUR 15 per kilo if paid at the airport.
Ryanair charges EUR 20 per kilo of excess baggage. Ryanair allows each passenger one carry-on bag only, with 
strict size limitations.
Passengers are even told to put newspapers and handbags into their carry-on bag before it is measured. If it is too 
big, it must go into the aircraft hold, at an additional charge.
If you are travelling with children, you may find yourself paying even more charges. For example, Ryanair will 
transport one pushchair per infant free of charge, but will charge EUR 10 per item per flight (if booked online) for 
additional infant equipment, such as car booster seats and travel cots. Any child over the age of two pays the full 
adult fare on Ryanair and Aer Lingus, and there is also a EUR 20 charge for children under two, even though they 
do not take up a seat.
Children who reach the age of two while on holiday must pay the full adult fare on the return journey. Similarly, 
travelling with sports equipment, such as golf bags or surf boards, will also inflate the cost of your trip. For example, 
Aer Lingus charge EUR 30 for such items for each leg of your journey, if booked online. If you pay at the airport on 
day of departure, the fee increases to EUR 40.
It's not just baggage fees that can cause holiday costs to shoot up. Boarding fees, seat selection and other charges 
can also make things expensive.
Ryanair charges EUR 10 for seat selection, and up to EUR 6 for priority boarding.
With Aer Lingus, seat selection fees vary from EUR 5 to EUR 25 on short-haul flights, but emergency row seats 
may be occupied without charge if still empty when all the passengers are aboard.
And whatever you do, don't forget to check in online and print your Ryanair boarding cards in advance. A fee of 
EUR 60 per passenger applies for an airport boarding card re-issue. So for a family of four, that's a EUR 240 hard-
earned lesson.
**Travel by sea or rail**
While those taking to the skies face an array of fees and charges, those opting for other modes of transport should 
also be mindful of travel costs. If you are planning a trip by road, rail or sea, check out online prices before booking 
at a ticket office, as the best deals can often be found on the web.
As with airline travel, you could face additional fees on top of the headline price, such as fees for card bookings. For 
example, Irish Ferries charges EUR 6 per car for all bookings made with credit and debit cards, except for Visa 
Your Money: Be vigilant about travel costs
Electron. The fee is levied per booking, not per passenger per leg of the journey, so it works out considerably 
cheaper than airline bookings.
Like airlines, other transport operators will levy charges on travellers transporting bulky items. For example, if you 
are planning a cycling trip, Irish Rail will charge EUR 6 to carry your bike for a single journey, or EUR 12 for a return 
ticket.
**Planning a trip at home**
If the cost of a trip abroad is too much for your family finances this summer, holidaying at home might be a more 
cost-effective option.
Last week, *The Sunday Business Post*took to Twitter to see what you thought about "staycationing". Our tweet 
drew a mixed response, with some of you telling us that Irish prices did keep costs down. Others felt there was 
good value to be had if you were prepared to hunt (see People in Focus below).
The NCA has just launched an online planner to help holidaymakers taking a break in Ireland to budget for their trip. 
Costs such as accommodation, eating out and entry to tourist attractions are considered. Consumers can use the 
budget planner to stick to a holiday budget, and also to work out a daily spending limit.
"If you are planning a holiday at home this year or hoping to get a last minute deal, you may think it is too late to 
budget," said Fitzgerald. "However, budgeting is important both before you go and while you are away."

Air France to slash 'excess' jobs in restructuring move

Air France-KLM yesterday confirmed for the first time it would be cutting staff at Air France as part of a restructuring 
plan intended to restore the group to profit.
Alexandre de Juniac, Air France's chief executive, briefed trade unions on a proposed restructuring that would 
involve splitting the airline's lossmaking short- and medium-haul operations into three new units.
The Air France-KLM group is struggling with high operating costs and a large debt load and last year reported a net 
loss of EUR809m . While the group's challenges are more serious than its main peers, Lufthansa and International 
Airlines Group are also seeking to improve their short-haul operations because of strong competition from low-cost 
carriers led by Ryanair and easyJet.
IAG, parent of British Airways and Iberia, last year created a new low-cost airline in Spain. This year, Lufthansa is 
seeking to reduce duplication between its short-haul point-to-point operations and Germanwings, its low-cost 
carrier.
"It has been confirmed that Air France has excess staff," said Air France, adding that proposals on headcount 
reduction would be made next month after further talks with the unions. It employs 55,000 people.
The restructuring of Air France's short- and medium-haul operations is likely to be contentious, partly because 
François Hollande, France's new president, made preserving jobs a central part of his campaign.
Mr de Juniac said Air France was being placed "on the path to profitable growth . . . in a context of extremely fierce 
international competition".
Air France is seeking to persuade pilots and cabin crew at its short-haul operations to work longer for the same pay 
as part of a EUR2bn cost-savings programme. It aims to improve productivity by 20 per cent by 2015.
Air France to slash 'excess' jobs in restructuring move
Under the restructuring, the first of Air France's short- and medium-haul units will focus on feeding the airline's hub 
at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Air France's long-haul operations are based there.
The second unit will concentrate on regional services and Air France is considering having minority investors in the 
business.
The third unit will be Transavia France, Air France's low-cost carrier that focuses on holiday destinations and its 
operations are due to be expanded.
Pilots and cabin crew at Transavia France work longer hours compared with their Air France colleagues.

STANSTED Airport operated as normal yesterday in spite of industrial action by baggage handlers.
Members of the Unite and GMB unions working for contractor Swissport staged the first of three planned walkouts 
yesterday as part of a dispute over work rotas.
Unite claims that Swissport's measures would mean ramp staff work 14 extra days a year with no additional pay.
Further strikes are planned for over 26-28 May, and 2-6 June, meaning disruption is possible over the diamond 
jubilee bank holidays.
But Swissport said that contingency plans meant passengers did not experience delays yesterday.
The company handles cargo and baggage for a number of airlines at Stansted including Ryanair, Monarch and 
Thomson.
Paul Bouch, Unite regional officer, said: "Swissport has forced our members' backs to the wall. After eight weeks of 
talks the company is still determined to press ahead with its unreasonable roster and holiday allocation changes."
"The revised roster would avoid the necessity of imposing compulsory redundancies," Swissport's spokesman said.
Talks between the unions and Swissport broke down last week.

Aer Lingus welcomes UK court victory over Ryanair

Aer Lingus welcomed a court victory Tuesday that permits British authorities to keep investigating Ryanair over its 
ownership of a 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus, a sore point between Ireland's two major carriers.
Ryanair sought to block the probe into whether its status as the No. 1 shareholder in Aer Lingus represents a threat 
to competition on British-Irish air services. Ryanair lawyers argued that Britain's Office of Fair Trading had no 
jurisdiction to investigate two Dublin-based airlines, and that the probe launched in 2010 came too late.
But the Court of Appeal in London sided with the Office of Fair Trading and Aer Lingus, which wants Ryanair to be 
forced to sell. Ryanair built its stake as part of a hostile 2006 takeover bid that was blocked both by European Union 
regulators and Ireland's government, which retains a 25 percent stake.
Ryanair said it would appeal Tuesday's judgment to the UK Supreme Court.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says he expects eventually to purchase the government's stake to take 
control of Aer Lingus because of Ireland's rapid descent to the brink of bankruptcy, culminating in a 2010 
international bailout. Ireland insists it won't sell its shares because an Aer Lingus-Ryanair merger would stifle 
competition on Ireland's air links to Europe.
Aer Lingus accuses Ryanair of being a disruptive presence inside the company since its surprise takeover bid was 
thwarted. The aggressive no-frills carrier has repeatedly criticized Aer Lingus' handling of costs, labor relations and 
corporate governance but does not have any votes in the boardroom.
Aer Lingus chief executive Christoph Mueller said he hoped the Office of Fair Trading soon would order Ryanair to 
dispose of an investment that runs "contrary to the interests of consumers and the majority of our shareholders."
"It is unacceptable that our principal competitor has been allowed to remain as a significant shareholder on our 
share register even though the European Commission blocked their hostile takeover almost 5 years ago," Mueller 
said. "This intolerable situation cannot be allowed to continue and today's judgment confirms that the OFT has the 
jurisdiction to investigate the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus."

The Court of Appeal in the UK today ruled that the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is "in time" to investigate Ryanair's 
minority shareholding in Aer Lingus under the UK's merger control legislation.
The judgment confirms the validity of the OFT's decision to begin its investigation into Ryanair's minority share

last year.
Aer Lingus' position is that it is unacceptable that its main competitor has been allowed to remain as a significant 
shareholder even though the European Commission blocked their hostile takeover almost five years ago.
Aer Lingus CEO, Christoph Mueller, said: "It is unacceptable that our principal competitor has been allowed to 
remain as a significant shareholder on our share register even though the European Commission blocked their 
hostile takeover almost five years ago. This intolerable situation cannot be allowed to continue and today's 
judgment confirms that the OFT has the jurisdiction to investigate the anti-competitive effects of Ryanair's minority 
shareholding in Aer Lingus. The OFT can now proceed swiftly to complete its investigation into Ryanair's 
shareholding which is contrary to the interests of consumers and the majority of our shareholders." Ryanair today 
said it had instructed its lawyers to immediately file a UK Supreme Court Appeal of today's Court of Appeal rejection 
of Ryanair's claim that the UK OFT is "out of time" to investigate Ryanair's 6 year old 29pc minority stake in Aer 
Lingus.

The ISEQ rose steadily this morning on hopes of a concerted action plan emerging to tackle the eurozone debt 
crisis.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was up 25.09 points to 3,056.18.
World shares gained for a second day as speculation grew that European leaders would agree on fresh action to 
tackle the region's debt crisis at an informal meeting later this week, and on reports China plans measures to boost 
sagging growth.
Greencore reported interim results this morning for the 26 weeks to March 30th 2012. The group delivered revenue 
growth of 49.9pc, boosted by the first-time contribution from Uniq. On an underlying basis, revenues increased by 
9.3pc. This was driven by a strong performance from the convenience foods division (+9.7pc). Group operating 
margins fell to 5.6pc (-50bps), which is as expected given that the acquired Uniq business has a lower margin 
profile. Adjusted EPS grew 19.65pc. Greencore is no longer listed on the ISEQ but Glanbia's shares rose 3c to 
E5.85. The Court of Appeal in the UK today ruled that the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is "in time" to investigate 
Ryanair's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus under the UK's merger control legislation. Shares in Aer Lingus were 
down 1c to E0.98. Ryanair reported 2012 net income this week of E502.6m with yield up 15.6pc and ancillaries up 
5pc per passenger. Unit costs increased by 6pc per passenger excluding fuel with the unit fuel cost up over 23pc, 
giving an operating profit per passenger of E8.2. Ryanair is guiding 2013 net income at E400-440m, down 16pc 
yoy. The airline is 90pc hedged but still envisages a E320m fuel headwind which will only be partially offset by 
yields +3pc. "Our price target is little changed at E5.20 which represents 13x forward earnings plus the capitalised 
dividend of E483m in FY13 and with FCF of E750-950m in the next three years, we see further returns to 
shareholders," said Goodbodys. Shares in Ryanair fell 5c to E3.99.

The ISEQ rose steadily in modest trading volumes today on hopes of a concerted action plan emerging to tackle the

World shares gained for a second day amid speculation of fresh action by European leaders to tackle the region's

positive tone in equity markets.

To describe Europe as having too much airline capacity would be an understatement. The existence of 40 airlines 
flying intra-region, many with market shares of less than 1 per cent, is a luxury the recession-hit area can ill afford. 
So as cost pressures intensify, demand remains constrained and the ability of cash-strapped governments to 
support these carriers ebbs, consolidation looks inevitable.
The challenge for solvent carriers is to take advantage. So far, Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by market 
capitalisation, has moved shrewdly. It seized on Malev's demise by opening a new Budapest base within weeks 
and deploying some of its winter-grounded fleet there. Similar expansion in Spain after Spanair's collapse has 
elevated Barcelona into one of its top four bases. Michael O'Leary, chief executive, predicts more of the same next 
winter. In short, market share gains should make Ryanair's 4-5 per cent annual growth objective amply achievable.
Profits are another matter - and Ryanair shares have fallen 11 per cent over the past week as the focus has shifted 
to the 2012/13 outlook. Yesterday's company predictions were so-so on the cost front: an extra EUR320m on the 
2012/13 fuel bill was much as expected, with flat costs elsewhere. But expectations of a mere 3 per cent increase in 
fares, after a 16 per cent rise in the year to March 2012, did surprise.
True, Ryanair has been cautious before: a year ago, it steered towards after-tax profits in 2011/12 of EUR400m but 
has delivered EUR503m. That may make investors sceptical about 2012/13 guidance of a net EUR400m-EUR440m 
(20 per cent below consensus numbers). Even so, the shares, on a historic multiple of 11.5 times, do not look 
particularly cheap compared, say, with easyJet's 10 times 2012 multiple, even allowing for the former's record and 
solid balance sheet. No need to rush to check in.

BUDGET airline Ryanair yesterday announced record profits of (EURO)503m (£406m) for the year to March 2012, 
an increase of a quarter on a like-for-like basis.
But the Dublin-based firm said that this would be the last year of expectation-beating profit rises and warned that 
returns could drop by as much as 20 per cent during the next fiscal year.
"Recession, austerity, currency concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases will make it difficult to repeat 
this year's record results," said chief executive Michael O'Leary.
"If we were guiding a blue sky scenario with rising fares into next winter, we would be nuts," he said.
Ryanair has focussed on increasing fares - up 16 per cent this year - in order to offset substantial hikes in taxes and 
oil prices.
The tactic has paid off, with revenue up 19 per cent at (EURO)4,325m, helping to negate a (EURO)360m increase 
in fuel costs.
Chief financial officer Howard Millar said that traffic will grow by five per cent to reach 79m in the year to March 
2013 but explained that substantial fare increases are no longer possible.
Asked about the effects of the Greek economic crisis, he commented: "Greece is very small for us. We would be 
more concerned about places like Spain, its high unemployment and plans to raise taxes."
The airline also confirmed it would hand (EURO)483m to shareholders in just its second dividend payout since 
floating in 1997.
Ryanair says fuel prices will drive down profits
Despite aiming to slow its previously rapid expansion Ryanair has recently expanded into Hungary, Spain and 
Scandanavia to take over from defunct local operators.
The additional bases led them to purchase 25 new aircraft and open 330 new routes, taking the total number of 
Ryanair routes to over 1,500. Peter Hyde, an analyst at Liberum Capital, reaffirmed his buy rating: "We expect 
Ryanair to focus on delivering growth in net income per passenger and to benefit from capacity discipline, slowing 
its own growth, closing the fare gap and weak competitors exiting the market."
Shares in the firm were down 2.5 per cent.

Group still eyes big order for aircraft
Body
Ryanair has warned that its profits should fall in 2012-13 because of high fuel prices and the eurozone crisis but 
insisted it still wants to place another large order for aircraft.
Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said yesterday he could justify buying up to 300 new aircraft because 
some European airlines were going bust and the continent's large flag carriers were scaling back short-haul routes.
But if an aircraft order is not finalised by 2014-15, he held out the prospect of Ryanair issuing another special 
dividend.
At its results for 2011-12, Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost carrier by revenue, proposed a second special 
dividend worth EUR483m, after a maiden payment of EUR500m in 2010. Mr O'Leary said: "We are bereft of ideas 
so we just give the money back to the people who own the company."
He went on to insist that Ryanair could still secure a cheap aircraft order even though Airbus and Boeing are 
reporting strong demand from airlines for their new generation of more fuel-efficient narrow-body jets. He said 
Ryanair was also talking to Comac, the Chinese aircraft maker, about a potential order.
Ryanair reported revenue of EUR4.4bn for the year to March 31, up 21 per cent compared with 2010-11.
Net profit rose 50 per cent to EUR560.4m, with the performance flattered by one-off items including the sale of four 
aircraft engines. Basic earnings per share rose from EUR0.25 one year ago to EUR0.38 in 2011-12.
Analysts expressed disappointment with Ryanair's guidance for net profit before exceptionals to be between 
EUR400m and EUR440m in 2012-13, compared with EUR502.6m in 2011-12.
Ryanair warns fuel cost set to hit profits
The airline's shares closed down 0.25 per cent at EUR4.04 but some analysts highlighted Ryanair's practice of 
issuing conservative guidance that is subsequently upgraded.
Ryanair expects its pre-tax profit in 2012-13 to be dented by a EUR320m increase in its fuel bill and it plans to 
repeat what it did last winter, when 80 aircraft were grounded .
Mr O'Leary said earnings would also be reduced by recession in the eurozone. Ryanair's average fares rose 16 per 
cent in 2011-12 but the airline expects a 3 per cent increase in 2012-13.
Andrew Light, analyst at Citi, described Ryanair's outlook as "poor", saying the lower than expected profit guidance 
appeared predicated on "lower fares and eurozone recession".

Ireland's Aer Lingus airline is celebrating a British court victory that permits the UK Office of Fair Trading to keep 
investigating Ryanair over the rival carrier's ownership of a 30 percent stake in Aer Lingus.
Ryanair sought to block the probe into whether its status as the No. 1 shareholder in Aer Lingus represents a threat 
to full-fledged competition on British-Irish air services. Ryanair lawyers argued that the Office of Fair Trading had no 
jurisdiction to investigate two Dublin-based airlines, and that the probe launched in 2010 came too late.
The UK Court of Appeal sided with the Office of Fair Trading and Aer Lingus, which wants Ryanair to be forced to 
sell. Ryanair built its stake as part of a failed 2006 takeover bid. Ireland's government owns 25 percent.

Leading low-cost carriers enjoyed double-digit revenue growth in 2011 as collective passenger numbers rose nearly 
12%. The latest Airline Business low-cost carrier survey showed revenues increased strongly at virtually all of the 
30-plus carriers for which 2011
financial results were available.
Southwest Airlines remained the largest budget operator by revenue and passenger numbers. Its revenues jumped 
nearly 30% to $15.7 billion when accounting for its 2011 acquisition of AirTran. Excluding the merger, its revenues 
were up 6%. Passenger numbers reached 135 million.
Ryanair, using an annual figure based on revenues from its four published quarters, was the second-largest no-frills 
operator by revenues at just less than $6 billion. The budget carrier was also among the most profitable of low-cost 
operators.
It posted net profits of $496 million to March 2011 and has been aiming for net profits of $630 million for its latest 
financial year. Passenger numbers across 75 low-cost carriers in the survey grew 11.6% in 2011.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) confirmed that it had instructed its lawyers to immediately file a 
UK Supreme Court Appeal of today's Court of Appeal rejection of Ryanair's claim that the UK OFT is "out of time" to 
investigate Ryanair's 6 year old 29% minority stake in Aer Lingus plc.
The company reaffirmed that when the EU Commission prohibited Ryanair's takeover offer for Aer Lingus in June 
2007, the Commission confirmed that Ryanair could not be forced to sell its 29% minority stake, since Ryanair did 
not have de facto or de jure control of Aer Lingus.
Ryanair's lawyers would immediately apply to appeal today's ruling to the UK Supreme Court and would seek a 
suspension of any OFT investigation pending an outcome of this Supreme Court appeal.

Budget airline Ryanair reported record profits Monday as its recession-resistant business model continued to attract 
passengers from higher-fare carriers amid Europe's debt crisis.
The Dublin-based airline said its net profit for the fiscal year ending March 31 rose nearly 50 percent to 
(EURO)560.4 million ($715 million), the highest figure ever for the 27-year-old airline.
Ryanair known for its brash boss and its in-your-face advertising style did offer a typically cautious outlook. It 
forecast that passenger numbers in the current fiscal year would rise a further 5 percent to 79 million, chiefly in the 
peak April-September period, but rising fuel costs were likely to weaken profits to an annual net figure of between 
(EURO)400 million and (EURO)440 million.
Ryanair usually beats its targets, but investors dumped the shares, particularly over its warning of higher oil costs 
and weaker profits in the peak months of 2012. Shares fell 5 percent to (EURO)3.81 ($4.87) in early trade on the 
Irish Stock Exchange.
Sales rose 21 percent to (EURO)4.39 billion even though the number of passengers carried rose just 5 percent to 
75.8 million, reflecting ticket prices that were 16 percent higher on average. Fuel costs rose 30 percent to nearly 
(EURO)1.6 billion because of higher oil prices and Ryanair's continuing expansion of its route network and all-
Boeing 737 fleet.
Excluding exceptional items and taxes, Ryanair's operating profit rose 40 percent to (EURO)683.2 million ($873 
million).
Its non-ticket income raised on everything from checked bags to online hotel bookings and on-board lottery tickets 
rose 11 percent to (EURO)886 million and now represents 21 percent of the airline's total sales.
Reflecting the record profits, chief executive Michael O'Leary said the airline planned to pay stockholders an 
exceptional dividend of (EURO)0.34 ($0.43) per share. Ryanair normally pays no dividends but can easily afford 
Ryanair posts record profit, cautious on outlook
one, since its cash pile grew 34 percent over the year to (EURO)2.7 billion, a staggering figure given the wave of 
bankruptcies and losses affecting the industry as a whole.
"The combination of rising oil prices and EU-wide recession has accelerated the rate of change in the competitive 
landscape," O'Leary said, noting the failures of Spanish carrier Spanair in January, Hungary's Malev in February 
and Denmark's Cimber Sterling this month.
"Ryanair has responded tactically to these developments by opening a new base in Budapest, (and) expanding 
bases in Spain, Scandinavia and provincial UK, to maximize capacity and minimize airfares for local consumers 
(and) visitors," he said. "We expect more European failures in 2012 as higher oil prices and recession continue to 
expose failed airline models as well as subscale or peripheral carriers."

European shares hit a fresh five-month low today after losing more than 5 percent last week as investors remained 
jittery about the ability of Greece and Spain to deal with their debt problems and due to concerns about the banking 
sector.
At 0812 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.5 percent at 965.86 points after 
falling to a low of 964.66, the lowest since December. The index fell more than 5 percent last week.
"The fact remains that there is still a question mark over Greece and there are ongoing concerns about a slowdown 
in China. There is a great deal of cash on the sidelines, waiting to be invested. But with the uncertainty, that money 
is likely to stay on the sidelines," Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said.
"Investors are looking to identify stable, strong cash-generative companies which do have geographical 
diversification. It's a kind of bottom-up approach rather than a top-down approach," he said, adding that companies 
such as Vodafone could be a good investment choice.
Vodafone shares were up 0.5 percent. The market ignored a statement by the Group of Eight economies on 
Saturday that their imperative was to promote growth and jobs. They also recognised problems among European 
banks and gave verbal backing for Greece to stay in the euro. Investors are concerned about the risk of a chaotic 
Greek exit from the euro, which would hit the region's banking system and possibly the global economy. European 
travel and leisure shares, down 1.2 percent, were the top decliners, with Ryanair falling more than 5 percent after 
warning that surging fuel costs and a worsening economic outlook meant profit would slip by up to 20 percent in the 
coming year. ( C) Reuters

The ISEQ hardly moved this morning as Ryanair posted record profits for its full year but warned that 2012/13 will 
be different.
By 12:30, the ISEQ was down 0.81 of a point to 3,013.45.
European shares bounced back from five-month lows as investors bought into some stocks and sectors that had 
been particularly badly hit in the previous week's sell-off, although charts signalled that the downtrend could resume 
again.
Shares in Ryanair helped keep the ISEQ in negative territory with stocks down 8c to E3.95 after it warned high fuel 
costs and a worsening economic outlook in Europe meant profit would slip by up to 20 percent in the coming year, 
the first fall in four years. The Dublin-based airline, famous for its no-frills service, posted a record annual profit on 
higher fares for the year to March, but warned its run of growth of at least 25 percent profit every year since 2009 
was likely to come to an end. "Recession, austerity, currency concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases 
... will make it difficult to repeat this year's record results," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary. "If we were guiding 
a blue sky scenario with rising fares into next winter, we would be nuts," he said. The airline confirmed it would pay 
out E483 million to shareholders in just its second dividend payout since floating in 1997. Bwin.party has 
announced that it intends to make a payment of E33m to the Spanish tax authorities (includes E25.6m payment and 
E8m interest/surcharges). The Spanish tax authorities have required that operators with customers in Spain pay 
back taxes under laws that previously did not related to offshore online gambling. Bwin.party and a number of other 
operators have completed a tax self-assessment in relation to the tax authority's request. Shares in Paddy Power 
rose 2c to E49.37. Cranswick saw improved performance in the latter part of the year to end March. For the full year 
earnings per share was up 6pc and revenues up 8pc. The company noted an improved environment in the second 
half, however, as the adverse impact of commodity price increases reversed through a combination of increased

prices and abatement of costs increases, while volume also picked up. Underlying sales were up 10pc, with

Body
Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, warned surging fuel costs and a worsening economic outlook meant profit 
would slip by up to 20 percent in the coming year, the first fall in four years.
The Dublin-based airline, which posted a record annual profit on Monday and has posted profit growth of at least 25 
percent every year since 2009, confirmed it would pay out 483 million euros (dollar 614.5 million) to shareholders in 
just its second dividend payout since floating in 1997.
Net profit reached 503 million euros for the year to March, up 25 percent on the previous year, compared with a 
forecast of 491 million by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
But it warned worsening economic conditions in Europe and stubbornly high fuel costs would cut its profit to 
between 400 million and 440 million euros in 2013, making it the first year since 2009 that profit has fallen.
"Recession, austerity, currency concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases ... will make it difficult to repeat 
this year's record results," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. "Any increase in fares will only 
partially offset higher fuel costs." The airline, which has a lower cost base than many of its competitors, raised fares 
16 percent over the year to help offset a fuel bill that was 30 percent higher. But it warned it would be unable to 
pass on an additional 320 million euro hike in fuel costs expected in the coming year. "There's a poor environment, 
it's the fourth year of this, and repeating (fare growth of) 16 percent is not going to happen," said Chief Financial 
Officer Howard Millar. He added fares would likely rise by closer to 3 percent. "Ryanair is not as worried about the 
fallout of Greece's current political crisis as the fact that the euro zone is suffering its fourth year of poor economic 
performance," Millar said. "Greece is very small for us ... we would be more concerned about places like Spain, its 
high unemployment and plans to raise taxes," he said. Traffic will grow by 5 percent for the second year in a row to 
reach 79 million in the year to March 2013, he said. Ryanair's share price peaked at 4.49 euros at the start of April,

but closed at 4.02 on Friday amid market turmoil sparked by concern about Greece's place in the euro zone. It is up 
6.3 percent since the start of the year, compared with 3.9 percent for Ireland's broader market. British peer EasyJet 
this month said it expected second-half revenue to rise as business travellers help it to overcome higher fares.

profit would slip by up to 20 percent in the coming year, the first fall in four years.
The Dublin-based airline, which posted a record annual profit today and has posted profit growth of at least 25 
percent every year since 2009, confirmed it would pay out 483 million euros to shareholders in just its second 
dividend payout since floating in 1997.
But it warned worsening economic conditions in Europe and stubbornly high fuel costs would cut its profit to 
between 400 million and 440 million euros in 2013, making it the first year since 2009 that profit has fallen.
"Recession, austerity, currency concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases ... will make it difficult to repeat 
this year's record results," Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. "Any increase in fares will only 
partially offset higher fuel costs." The airline, which has a lower cost base than many of its competitors, raised fares 
16 percent over the year to help offset a fuel bill that was 30 percent higher. But it warned it would be unable to 
pass on an additional 320 million euro hike in fuel costs expected in the coming year. "There's a poor environment, 
it's the fourth year of this, and repeating (fare growth of) 16 percent is not going to happen," said Chief Financial 
Officer Howard Millar. He added fares would likely rise by closer to 3 percent. "Ryanair is not as worried about the 
fallout of Greece's current political crisis as the fact that the euro zone is suffering its fourth year of poor economic 
performance," Millar said. "Greece is very small for us ... we would be more concerned about places like Spain, its 
high unemployment and plans to raise taxes," he said. Traffic will grow by 5 percent for the second year in a row to 
reach 79 million in the year to March 2013, he said. Ryanair's share price peaked at 4.49 euros at the start of April, 
but closed at 4.02 on Friday amid market turmoil sparked by concern about Greece's place in the euro zone. It is up 
6.3 percent since the start of the year, compared with 3.9 percent for Ireland's broader market. British peer EasyJet 
this month said it expected second-half revenue to rise as business travellers help it to overcome higher fares.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L) posted full-year pre-tax profit of 633.0 million euros, higher 
than 420.9 million euros last year.
Earnings per share were 37.94 cents versus 25.14 cents in the previous year.
Pre-tax profit, excluding exceptional items, was 567.7 million euros versus 450.6 million euros last year.
Total operating revenues - continuing operations grew to 4.39 billion euros from 3.63 billion euros a year ago.
Announcing these profits Ryanair's, Michael O'Leary, said,
"This 25% profit increase to a new record of ?503m and 5% traffic growth during a year of higher oil prices, and 
deep recession in Europe was a commendable result. Our fuel bill rose over ?360m as oil prices increased 16% 
from $73 to $85pbl. Excluding fuel, adjusted unit costs were flat during the year due to aggressive cost control, 
despite a modest company-wide pay increase, higher Eurocontrol fees and increased airport costs. Ancillary 
revenue outpaced traffic growth, rising by 11% to ?886m or 21% of total revenue."
The company's board believe it is opportune to propose a second special dividend of 0.34 euros per share payable 
in Nov 2012 subject to AGM approval. If paid, the company's 2nd special dividend will mean Ryanair has returned 
1.53 billion euros in dividends and share buybacks to shareholders over the past 5 years.
Looking forward, Ryanair expects traffic in FY13 will grow by 5% to just over 79 million passengers. H1 traffic will 
grow 7% while H2 will grow by 3%.
The company anticipates that fuel bill will rise by 320 million euros in FY13 with most of this increase skewed into 
H1, and as a result it expects to report a Q1 profit fall due to these higher prices.
Ryanair remains concerned about next winter as it has zero yield visibility but expect recession, austerity, currency 
concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases in Hungary, Poland, Provincial UK, and Spain will make it 
difficult to repeat this year's record results. Ryanair expects that any increase in fares will only partially offset higher 
fuel costs, and accordingly it is guiding net profit in FY13 subject to final yield outturn will be lower than FY12 in a 
range of between 400 million euros to 440 million euros.

(RTTNews) - Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYAAY, RYA.L), Europe's largest budget airline, reported Monday a higher 
profit for the year ended March 31, but warned that earnings would decline in the ongoing fiscal year amid a 
challenging Europe and increasing oil prices. The company expects that any increase in ticket prices will only 
partially offset higher fuel costs. The stock is down over 5 percent.
"We remain concerned about next winter as we have zero yield visibility but expect recession, austerity, currency 
concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases in Hungary, Poland, Provincial UK, and Spain will make it 
difficult to repeat this year's record results," the airline said.
Ryanair sees year-over-year decline in net profit for fiscal 2013 in a range of 400 million to 440 million euros, 
subject to final yield outturn. The airline reported adjusted profit attributable to shareholders of 502.6 million euros 
($643 million) in the just concluded year.
Pre-tax profit for the year increased to 633.0 million euros from 420.9 million euros in the prior year. The results 
included an exceptional item of 57.8 million euros relating to a one-off release of ticket sales revenue.
Excluding exceptional items, pre-tax profit advanced to 567.7 million euros from 450.6 million euros.
Operating revenues grew to 4.39 billion euros from 3.63 billion euros a year ago. Excluding items, revenue 
increased 19 percent to 4.33 billion euros as traffic grew 5 percent and average fares improved 16 percent.
Fuel and oil costs climbed 30 percent to 1.59 billion euros. Ryanair expects more European failures in 2012, as 
higher oil prices and recession continue to expose failed airline models as well as subscale or peripheral carriers.
The airline expects that traffic in fiscal 2013 will grow by 5 percent to just over 79 million passengers. Traffic in the 
first half of the year is expected to grow 7 percent while the second-half growth will be 3 percent, the company said.
Ryanair expects profit to drop in the first half of the ongoing year as fuel bill is expected to rise by 320 million euros 
in fiscal 2013 with most of the increase skewed into the first half.
Further, the company announced a special dividend of 0.34 euros per share payable in November. This follows a 
special dividend of the same amount announced in June 2010.
RYA.L is losing 0.23 pence or 5.75 percent and is currently trading at 3.82 pence.

(RTTNews) - The UK market is advancing in afternoon trading on Monday, after G8 leaders said over the weekend 
that they want Greece to stay in the Eurozone. Sentiment was also influenced by some positive remarks about 
growth made by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
Germany raised 2.910 billion euros from the sale of its Treasury discount paper, or Bubills, with 12 months maturity, 
Bundesbank said. The target set for the sale was 3 billion euros. The auction attracted bids totaling 6.170 billion 
euros.
The average yield on the 1-year debt fell to 0.0264 percent from 0.0743 percent in the previous sale on April 23. 
The bid-to-cover ratio, which indicates demand, dropped to 2.1 from 2.3.
Leaders of the G8 nations on Saturday said they support Greece remaining in the Eurozone, while welcoming the 
ongoing discussion in Europe on how to generate growth alongside a firm commitment on fiscal consolidation.
"We agree on the importance of a strong and cohesive Eurozone for global stability and recovery, and we affirm our 
interest in Greece remaining in the Eurozone while respecting its commitments," the leaders said in a statement 
after the conclusion of the Cap David Summit at Maryland in the U.S.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and his French counterpart Pierre Moscovici are meeting in Berlin 
later today.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao reportedly stated that going forward the nation would give bigger priority to policies 
aimed at growth. The statement comes after a string of official data that indicated a slowdown in the world's second 
largest economy.

which includes some major U.K. Companies, is gaining 0.39 percent.

day firmly in negative territory, at their worst closing levels in four months, as traders were reluctant to hold 
positions going into the weekend. The Dow fell 0.6 percent, the Nasdaq plunged 1.2 percent and the S&P 500 slid 
0.7 percent.

Ryanair, Europe's largest low-cost airline, warned the market of a dramatic profit slump for the next year, despite 
beating analyst expectations with a 25 percent surge in profits for the 12 months leading up to 31 March 2012.
Despite profit after tax growing by  50m euros year-on-year, beating analyst forecasts of  419m, Ryanair said in a 
statement that higher fuel costs and worsening economic conditions will erase most of last years profits, as it 
predicts profits could slump by up to 20 percent.
Ryanair shares plunged more than 6.35 percent in early trading Monday to change hands at  3.79, the lowest level 
since late January.
"Recession, austerity, currency concerns and lower fares at new and growing bases ... will make it difficult to repeat 
this year's record results," said Chief Executive Michael O'Leary in a statement. "Any increase in fares will only 
partially offset higher fuel costs."
Revenues increased by 19 percent to  4.33b in 2011 to 2012, as the number of passengers grew 5 percent to 
almost 76m and average fares climbed 16 percent.
However, fuel costs soared 30 percent over the reporting period and the group warned it would be unable to pass 
on an additional  320mn hike in fuel costs expected in the coming year and that the recession in Europe would 
make it "difficult" to repeat the record results. 
"There's a poor environment, it's the fourth year of this, and repeating (fare growth of) 16 percent is not going to 
happen," said Chief Financial Officer Howard Millar in a statement. "Ryanair is not as worried about the fallout 
of Greece's current political crisis as the fact that the euro zone is suffering its fourth year of poor economic 
performance. Greece is very small for us ... we would be more concerned about places like Spain, its high 
unemployment and plans to raise taxes."
Despite the warning, Ryanair announced it would pay out  483m to shareholders in its second-ever dividend payout 
since floating in 1997. 
Ryanair Shares Fall Sharply as High Fuel Costs Hit Profits
Ryanair is the latest in a long line of airlines that have voiced concerns, issued profit warnings or issued actual 
drops in profits, following the rising cost of fuel. 
IBTimes UK revealed that while many airlines use hedging, the act of entering a range of financial product contracts 
or hedges that look to protect them against certain market price movements, in order to help manage the risk of 
rising fuel costs, this was not enough to mitigate losses.
While the fuel hedging programme was not broken down in the latest set of results, Ryanair showed in its third 
quarter earnings statement that it had hedged 90 percent of its fuel on average for the full year of 2012 at $820 per 
metric tonne (pmt) and it will hedge 80 percent of fuel on average at $990/pmt for the full year of 2013.

Budget airline Ryanair has reported record profits as its recession-resistant business model continues to attract 
passengers from higher-fare carriers.
The Dublin-based airline said Monday its full-year net profit for the fiscal year ending March 31 rose nearly 50 
percent to (EURO)560.4 million ($715 million), a record high for the business.
Sales rose 21 percent to (EURO)4.39 billion even though the number of passengers carried rose just 5 percent to 
75.8 million, reflecting higher average ticket prices. Fuel costs rose 30 percent to nearly (EURO)1.6 billion because 
of higher oil prices and Ryanair's continuing expansion of its route network and all-Boeing 737 fleet.
Reflecting the record profits, Ryanair says it plans to pay stockholders an exceptional dividend of (EURO)0.34 
($0.43) per share.
