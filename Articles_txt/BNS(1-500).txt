Estonia: Some 220,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in November
TALLINN, Dec 05, BNS – Some 220,000 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in November, which is 6 
percent more compared with the same month of the previous year.
The increase in the number of passengers was thanks to a tighter flight schedule -- in November there were 91 
more scheduled flights than at the same time last year, while the number of seats on sale exceeded the figure 
recorded at the same time a year ago by 10 percent, the airport said.
Regular flights to 31 different destinations were operated out of Tallinn in November. The most popular direct flight 
destinations were traditionally the larger hubs of Frankfurt, Helsinki and Riga. The airline with the largest market 
share in November was Air Baltic, which carried every fourth passenger passing through Tallinn Airport. Air Baltic is 
flying to altogether 15 destinations from Tallinn during the winter season. With nine destinations, the next largest 
airline was Ryanair, whose flights were used by 14 percent of all passengers. Among the charter flights, the most 
popular destination was Egypt.
A total of 2,922 flight operations, meaning an average of 97 arrivals and departures per day, took place in 
November.
Eero Pargmae, a member of the management board of Tallinn Airport, said that active preparations are already 
underway today to put together the summer flight schedule for next year.
"We have previously announced the arrival of Transavia France in Estonia, which will start flights to Paris in April. In 
addition, Eurowings will also start flying from Tallinn as a new airline in the summer, connecting Tallinn with Prague 
3-4 times a week starting from the end of March. Eurowings is a German low-cost airline that is part of Lufthansa 
Group," Pargmae said.
Estonia : Some 220,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in November
Elsewhere in Estonia, regional airports served a total of 4,912 passengers in November -- 3,467 in Kuressaare and 
1,069 in Kardla. From November, it is once again possible to fly on the Parnu-Ruhnu-Kuressaare route with the 
airline Diamond Sky.

Estonia: Over 284,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in October
TALLINN, Nov 08, BNS - A total of 284,215 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in October, equaling the 
high-season volume recorded in August and the same month last year.
Across the first 10 months of the year the airport served 2,516,276 passengers -- a rise of 7.8 percent on the same 
period in 2022, according to the airport.
Eero Pargmae, a member of the management board of Tallinn Airport, says he is delighted that people are 
continuing to utilize the fall school holidays to travel.
"The summer peak has passed, but the fall school break remains one of the busiest periods for travel, with more 
than 66,000 people of all ages passing through the airport each week," he noted. "October saw a 5 percent rise in 
passenger numbers on regular flights year on year, and those numbers started going up in the week before the 
school holidays. As expected, the most popular destination during the month was Antalya, which more than 17,000 
people flew to."
He added that the extensions to the airport’s long-term A2 car park were completed just before the holidays, 
providing 400 further parking spaces and thereby alleviating the shortfall during peak travel periods.
The winter flight schedule came into effect around the world at the end of October.
"More seats than ever before are on sale for flights out of Tallinn this winter season," Pargmae said. "Travelers 
have a choice of 40 direct routes operated by 17 different airlines, which for winter represents a great range of 
destinations. Tickets are cheaper than they were during the high season, which is an added bonus. The winter 
schedule this year is also more favorable for business travelers, with flights to Vilnius being geared more towards 
them and extra flights operating to major hubs."
Estonia : Over 284,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in October
Flights to 37 different destinations were operated out of Tallinn by 15 airlines in October. Ryanair's connections to 
Dublin and Paphos were restored at the end of the month, while Air Baltic launched direct flights to Tenerife and 
Tampere. In total, 3,402 flight operations took place during the month, with an average of 110 arrivals and 
departures each day.
Elsewhere in Estonia, regional airports served a total of 4,600 passengers in October -- 3,446 in Kuressaare, 1,115 
in Kardla and 39 in Tartu.

Lithuania: president, Seimas board remain at odds over restrictions to Belarusian citizens
VILNIUS, Sept 05, BNS – The Board of the Seimas of Lithuania and President Gitanas Nauseda said after a 
meeting on Tuesday that they continue to take different positions on putting restrictions for Belarusian citizens on a 
par with the existing ones for Russians.
The president maintains that the restrictions should be identical, while the speaker of the Seimas calls for human 
rights to be kept in mind.
"Yes, there are differences of opinion. My opinion is that I agree that the mood of the Belarusian people is different 
from that of the Russian people, that they are perhaps less intoxicated by the mass propaganda that has been 
carried out in Russia, that they are closer to us geopolitically, traditionally, historically," Nauseda told reporters on 
Tuesday after a meeting with the board of the parliament.
"But let's understand one thing – Alexander Lukashenko is very skilled at using his people as objects, as tools. We 
have to remember the guy who was the victim of the plane that was turned back to Minsk. It was really very sad to 
see this whole story and the genesis of this story," he added, referring to the detention of Belarusian activist Raman 
Pratasevich.
Pratasevich was detained by the Minsk regime in 2021 after the Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania was 
forced to divert and land in Minsk following false reports from Belarus officials that there was a threat of an 
explosion. However, no explosives were later found on that plane.
The blogger was then accused by Belarusian law enforcement authorities of helping to coordinate mass protests 
against the authoritarian Lukashenko regime and of a conspiracy to seize power.
Following his arrest, Belarusian state media published videos of Pratasevich’s "confession".
Lithuania : president, Seimas board remain at odds over restrictions to Belarusian citizens
In May, he was sentenced to eight years in prison but was pardoned by Lukashenko the same month.
According to the Lithuanian president, this story "only shows that a dictator breaks a man, a dictator uses him for 
his own black purposes, and he can do the same with other people".
He added that he believes that other measures can be considered, but it is important to realize that the threat from 
Belarus is very real.
At the same time, Seimas Speaker Viktorija Cmilyte-Nielsen stressed that it was important to keep human rights in 
mind when discussing security issues.
"Perhaps there is a slight difference of opinion on the issue of equal treatment of Russian and Belarusian citizens 
[as regards restrictions], and we will probably have a discussion in the Seimas here if there is such an initiative," the 
parliamentary speaker said.
Cmilyte-Nielsen takes the position that the restrictions on Russian and Belarusian citizens should remain different.
Radvile Morkunaite-Mikuleniene, leader of the political group of the conservative Homeland Union-Lithuanian 
Christian Democrats (HU-LCD), said that the group was divided on the issue.
"I am of the opinion that there are indeed differences between Russian and Belarusian societies, and especially in 
the light of the huge demonstrations three years ago and the sanctions that the Belarusian regime subsequently 
imposed on Belarusian citizens, this is certainly not the same," she said.
Morkunaite-Mikuleniene argued that as long as there was no evidence that the security situation was deteriorating, 
there should be no major changes in this regard.
The Law on Restrictive Measures in Response to Military Aggression against Ukraine has imposed temporary 
restrictions for Russians and Belarusians to obtain Lithuanian visas and e-resident status, and bans them from 
bringing Ukrainian hryvnias into Lithuania. The measures are in place from May 2 this year to May 3, 2024.
However, Russian citizens face additional restrictions on entry to Lithuania and acquisition of real estate in the 
country. Lithuania also temporarily refuses to accept their residence permit applications
The parliament finally adopted the law in late April, overriding a veto from the president, who proposed to impose 
the same restrictions on Russian and Belarusian citizens.
Lithuanian politicians have returned to discussing the issue of the same restrictions for Russians and Belarusians 
after Minsk allowed the Wagner mercenary group to relocate to Belarus in the wake of its failed mutiny in Russia.

Riga Airport serves 702,946 passengers in July
RIGA, Aug 8 (LETA) - Riga Airport closed this year's July with a record number of passengers handled in the post-
pandemic period: the company's performance data show that last month 702,946 passengers chose Riga Airport as 
their airport of choice for their journeys, the airport said on Monday.

Since the start of the year, the airport has welcomed 3.7 million passengers, which is 42 percent of the total number 
of passengers handled at airports in the Baltic countries and 33 percent more than in the same period last year.
"The results of the first six months have already shown that we are very close to the levels of 2019 in terms of direct 
passenger traffic and we are leaders among the Baltic capitals in terms of passenger traffic renewal. When 
compared to other airports in Northern Europe, our recovery rate is also comparable to Copenhagen, Oslo and 
Stockholm, where passenger numbers are also around 85 percent of their levels in 2019. We are pleased that Riga 
Airport's leading position and market share in the Baltic States is strengthening, and this tendency has continued in 
July," said Riga Airport's CEO Laila Odina.
As reported, Riga Airport posted EUR 57.924 million in turnover for 2022, an increase of 82.3 percent against a 
year before. The airport generated a EUR 307,682 in profit, recovering from a loss incurred in 2021, according to

planes have now landed, operations are proceeding as usual at both airports," Vasiliauskas told BNS. "We are 
monitoring everything, the information may still be updated, but so far everything is normal."
The public broadcaster LRT's news website was the first to report about the delayed aircraft landings.

Postimees: Time is ripe for sell-off of rapidly growing Nordica
TALLINN, Jul 26, BNS – Climate Minister Kristen Michal's plan to sell the fast-growing  Nordic Aviation Group 
(NAG), or Nordica, would end Estonia's long saga of state aviation, and the deal could be appealing to different 
types of investors, Postimees reported.
The government has invested approximately 90 million euros in two aviation companies over the years, plus a loan 
of eight million euros for NAG during the COVID crisis. With the merger of Transpordi Varahaldus, which owns the 
planes, and NAG, which operates them, including its profitable subsidiary Regional Jet, the deal could recover 
these funds for taxpayers.
NAG was founded in the autumn of 2015, when Taavi Roivas was the prime minister and Michal was the minister of 
economic affairs. If the privatization plan succeeds, it can be said that Michal was the creator of the company, as 
well as the one who disposed of it.
It is easier to assess the strength of Transpordi Varahaldus. They buy aircraft, engines and spare parts and lease 
them to NAG, more specifically its subsidiary Regional Jet. They are consistently profitable. In last year's report, 
they had valued their assets at 85 million euros. They also have a loan of around 20 million euros on their balance 
sheet, taken from LHV.
It is possible that they also have room to assess their assets upwards, because during the COVID period they 
valued their assets downwards. In the end, however, it is a matter of negotiation how much aircraft and engines 
cost. The question is also whether only the equipment is sold, or revenue-generating contracts are part of the deal, 
and whether it's sold separately or together with NAG. In any case, the government stands to get the money put 
into the company back nicely and with some extra.
It's much more difficult to offer a valuation of NAG, or essentially its subsidiary Regional Jet. Last year, they made a 
profit of 1.5 million euros on revenue of 90 million euros. Even more remarkably, they managed to turn a small profit 
Postimees: Time is ripe for sell-off of rapidly growing Nordica
even in 2021, when COVID restrictions were still largely in place. It is claimed that there were only two airlines in 
Europe at the time -- Ryanair and NAG -- that were making a profit.
With NAG, the question is whether the potential buyer believes in the growth of such a business. It is a growth 
company, which has grown the number of its employees from 400 to 700 in a year. There are currently about 70 
vacancies on the NAG website, most of them not in Estonia. If NAG were not growing so fast, they could already be 
earning much higher profits, but at the moment most of the earnings are invested.
They have also publicly stated that they have recently extended and signed contracts for several years to come. 
They have not disclosed with whom and under what conditions, but it is likely that the partner is SAS. This could 
already mean a guaranteed revenue of several tens of millions of euros. If the buyer believes in such a business, 
then NAG can also be sold on good terms, Postimees says.

Estonia: Number of passengers serviced by Tallinn Airport in June unchanged on year
TALLINN, Jul 05, BNS - Tallinn Airport serviced a total of 1,395,508 passengers in the first half of 2023, 16 percent 
more than during the same period last year while the number of passengers in June was 269,911, in the same 
range as last year.
In June, 14 airlines operated flights departing from Tallinn to 32 direct destinations, in addition to charter flights, 
among which Antalya in Turkey continued to be the most popular destination. In addition, charter flights took place 
to the islands of Crete and Corfu in Greece, as well as to Montenegro and Tunisia, the airport reported.
Chairman of the management board of Tallinn Airport Riivo Tuvike said that the peak season for travel has arrived 
and people's desire to explore new places is still high.
"The summer months are the most popular time for travel both in Estonia and elsewhere. Airports are full of 
passengers and all vacationers must be serviced. I believe that compared to last year, the summer will go more 
smoothly for us and hopefully also elsewhere in Europe, but longer queues and more time should be considered in 
larger airports," he said in a press release.
Tuvike added that the summer flight schedule is diverse.
"Air Baltic has opened seasonal lines to Dubrovnik, Split, Rhodes, and Heraklion, and has resumed flight 
connections with Berlin and Oslo. The major European capitals are covered by direct connections, and of course, 
frequent connections with major hubs are what give us connectivity with all those more than 1,000 destinations 
where people want to fly from Estonia," he pointed out.
In total, there were 3,572 flight operations in June, or an average of 119 landings and take-offs per day. Air Baltic 
served the most passengers of all, flying to 16 different destinations. The airline was followed in terms of passenger

numbers by Ryanair, Lufthansa, and Finnair. The most passengers flew on the Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt, Stockholm,

Montenegro flight via Belarus airspace to Vilnius didn't breach sanctions – authorities
VILNIUS, Jun 13, BNS – Air Montenegro's plane did not violate sanctions when it flew over Belarus on its way to 
Vilnius as non-EU air carriers are only advised to avoid Belarusian airspace, Lithuanian aviation authorities said on 
Monday.
Belarus' news website Belsat.eu earlier reported, citing the MotolkoPomogi channel, that Air Montenegro's 4o-AOA 
charter flight from Tivat flew over Belarusian territory, despite the ban, before entering Lithuanian airspace and 
landing in Vilnius at 10 a.m. on Monday.
This was the fifth flight since the new charter route was launched in late May, Belsat.eu reported, noting that no 
planes had crossed Belarusian airspace on this route so far.
Based on preliminary information, the shortening of the route by the pilots was not caused by bad weather 
conditions or other unforeseen circumstances, according to the website.
The Lithuanian Transport Safety Administration (LTSA) told BNS that it was aware of the flight as it had given 
permission to Air Montenegro to operate a series of charter flights from Tivat to Vilnius and back.
"The operation of this flight does not constitute a violation as the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 
safety directive only recommends that non-EU air carriers entering Lithuanian airspace avoid Belarusian airspace. 
They are not prohibited from flying through Belarusian airspace," the LTSA said in a comment to BNS.
"EU air carriers cannot cross the country's airspace," it noted.
However, the authority said it would ask Air Montenegro to follow the recommendation.

Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation), Lithuania's air navigation service provider, also says that Montenegro is not on the 
list of sanctioned countries (which includes Russia and Belarus), that the flight is not subject to any sanctions and 
that the aircraft flew according to its flight plan.
In May 2021, Lithuania banned all flights in and out of the country from flying through Belarusian airspace. The 
move followed the forced landing of Ryanair's Athens-Vilnius flight in Minsk and the arrest of blogger Raman 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
In response, the EU also banned Belarusian carriers from its airspace and airports.

Estonia: 274,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in May
TALLINN, Jun 02, BNS – Tallinn Airport registered 273,996 passengers in May 2023, with an average seat load 
factor of 75 percent, up 4 percent year on year.
The number of passengers in the first five months of the year increased by 22 percent compared with the same 
period in 2022, the airport company Tallinna Lennujaam said in a press release.
In May, Air Baltic served the largest number of passengers, with a market share of 28 percent and a choice of 16 
destinations. The Latvian carrier was followed by Ryanair with a market share of 15 percent and Lufthansa and 
Finnair with 9 percent each. It was possible to fly to 32 destinations on regular direct flights from Tallinn in May. 
Charter flights meanwhile took passengers mainly to Antalya on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, but also to 
Montenegro, Tunisia, Egypt, and the islands of Crete and Corfu in Greece.
Eero Pargmae, member of the management board of AS Tallinna Lennujaam, pointed out that several new routes 
started operation in May.
"Air Baltic opened seasonal routes from Tallinn to Dubrovnik and Split in Croatia and Rhodes and Iraklion in 
Greece. Air Baltic also resumed flights to Berlin and Oslo. In mid-May, Aegean launched direct flights to Athens. 
The higher seat load factor of planes meanwhile shows that there is a strong demand for air tickets from both 
business and leisure travelers," Pargmae said.
A total of 5,526 passengers passed through the regional airports of Estonia in May. The number of passengers was 
highest, 3,617, in Kuressaare, main town of Saaremaa island, whereas the biggest increase was recorded in 
Kardla, in neighboring Hiiumaa, where passengers numbered 1,507. The number of passengers was 233 in Tartu 
and 169 in Parnu, where Nyxair launched the Parnu-Helsinki service on May 25. Two passengers passed through 
the airport of the small Gulf of Riga island of Kihnu in May.

Almost 233,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in April
TALLINN, May 08, BNS – Tallinn Airport served 232,936 passengers in April 2023, 7.2 percent more than during 
the same month last year.
The number of passengers increased by 5 percent on regular flights and by 32 percent on charter flights.
Air Baltic was the carrier with the largest market share in Tallinn in April, carrying 23 percent of all passengers and 
offering 10 destinations. Ryanair's market share was 17 percent, Lufthansa's 12 percent and Finnair's 9 percent, 
the state-owned airport company said.

and 30 weekly flights respectively. The average load factor for scheduled flights was 74 percent in April, compared 
to 66 percent in the same month last year.
Eero Pargmae, board member of the airport company AS Tallinna Lennujaam, said Air Baltic will bring an additional 
aircraft to Tallinn this summer, thereby significantly increasing the capacity for flights out of Tallinn.
"In the first days of May, we opened four new Air Baltic routes: to Split, Rhodes, Dubrovnik and Heraklion. For the 
summer, the Berlin direct route was reopened with four departures a week and the Oslo route with two departures, 
which together with services by Norwegian will provide seven departures a week to Oslo. Flights to the summer 
destinations of Malaga and Nice are now available three days a week already, while the frequency of flights to Paris 
will increase to four departures a week," said Pargmae.
There are three Ryanair destinations in Italy available this summer season: Milan, Rome and Venice, and Wizz Air 
will also be flying to Milan Malpensa Airport. The Greek airline Aegean will start direct flights to Athens on May 16.
Almost 233,000 passengers pass through Tallinn Airport in April
April also saw the start of a very active Turkish holiday season, which made Antalya one of the five destinations 
with the largest number of passengers from Tallinn. During the peak summer season, there will be up to five flights 
per day from Tallinn to Antalya, including scheduled flights by Sunexpress and charter flights. In May, Smartlynx will 
start charter flights from Tallinn to Corfu and Tivat in Montenegro.

Lithuanian formin slams Minsk court's sentence for Pratasevich
VILNIUS, May 03, BNS – Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis has condemned a Minsk court 
decision to sentence Belarusian blogger and activist Raman Pratasevich to eight years in prison.
"We unequivocally condemn it. (...) The story is complicated, and we have been consistent in our assessment that 
he's a victim of repression, regardless of what the regime has been spreading or what he has been forced to say," 
Lithuania's top diplomat told BNS on Wednesday.
Pratasevich was detained by the Minsk regime in 2021 after the Ryanair plane flying from Greece to Lithuania was 
forced to divert and land in Minsk following false reports from Belarus officials that there was a threat of an 
explosion. However, no explosives were later found on that plane.
The blogger was then accused by Belarusian law enforcement authorities of helping to coordinate mass protests 
against the authoritarian Lukashenko regime and of a conspiracy to seize power.
"What has happened is, in fact, sad but not surprising because this is the kind of a regime that treats its citizens like 
this and has done so before," Landsbergis said.
Two other defendants in this case, Sciapan Pucila and Jan Rudzik, who live abroad, were tried in absentia and 
were sentenced to 20 and 19 years in prison respectively.
Pratasevich was flying from Greece to Lithuania with his Russian girlfriend Sofia Sapega. She was later accused of 
incitement to social discord and threatening law enforcement officials. A Belarusian court sentenced her to six years 
in prison in May, 2022.
Lithuanian formin slams Minsk court's sentence for Pratasevich
Following their arrests in 2021, Belarusian state media published videos of Pratasevich and Sapega's 
"confessions". Opposition supporters said they were forced to confess as it was the regime's common tactic to put 
pressure on critics.

Estonian Competition Authority to Ryanair: Tallinn Airport fees are justified
TALLINN, Apr 25, BNS - According to the price analysis of the Estonian Competition Authority, the fees of Tallinn 
Airport are justified, and therefore the complaint of the low-cost airline Ryanair was not satisfied.
Tallinn Airport announced an increase in fees in the summer of 2022. Pursuant to the Aviation Act, Tallinna 
Lennujaam AS is not obliged to coordinate the fee rates with the Competition Authority before implementation, but 
both the airport user and the manager may turn to the Competition Authority with a request to analyze the 
justification of changing the fee rates.
On Oct. 31 of last year, Ryanair submitted a request to check the airport fees established by Tallinn Airport and, in 
addition, a complaint to identify violations by Tallinn Airport.
With Monday's decision, the Competition Authority considered Tallinn Airport's fees justified. In the proceedings, it 
was not established that Tallinn Airport had erred against the law and the methodology for calculating airport 
charges when determining the airport charges. However, the Competition Authority drew attention to the fact that 
Tallinn Airport is Estonia's largest international airport, to which there is no significant alternative. Therefore, Tallinn 
Airport must comply with the requirements of the Competition Act in its operations and it is forbidden to apply 
different conditions in the case of equivalent agreements, thus putting some airlines in an unfavorable competitive 
situation.
According to the Aviation Act, Tallinn Airport publishes the new fee rates in accordance with the Competition 
Authority's decision on its website and may apply them after two weeks from the publication of the new fee rates.
The Estonian Competition Authority exercises supervision in the fields of, competition, natural gas, district heating, 
postal services, public water supply and sewerage and railways. In addition, the authority settles disputes regarding 
airport fees.

Airlines still sell tickets for flights restricted due to NATO summit in Vilnius
VILNIUS, Apr 21, BNS – Although flights at Vilnius Airport will be temporarily suspended during NATO's summit in 
the Lithuanian capital on July 11-12, Ryanair and Wizz Air are still selling tickets for travel during the restriction 
period, the 15min online news site reported on Friday.
Tadas Vasiliauskas, spokesman for Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Lithuania's three 
international airports, told the website that air carriers have already received all the information about the planned 
restrictions and are rescheduling some flights, but some are still selling tickets for the days.
Under EU law, flight restrictions due to the NATO summit in Vilnius are considered as an extraordinary 
circumstance beyond the carrier's control, so airlines are not obliged to compensate passengers for cancellations, 
according to the spokesman.
The Transport Ministry said earlier in April that, in line with NATO's security requirements, all flights would be 
banned within a 30-kilometer radius of Vilnius' Litexpo Exhibition Center from noon on July 11 to 2 p.m. on July 12.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers for March up 35 pct on year
TALLINN, Apr 06, BNS –  A total of 232,951 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in March 2023, which is 35 
percent more than in the same month the year before and the best March result ever.
Also, the number of passengers in March exceeded the 2019 passenger number for the first time, which is a 
significant sign of the recovery of demand, spokespeople for the airport said. According to the latest forecast by 
Airports Council International (ACI) Europe, the number of passengers in Europe as a whole is not expected to 
return to the pre-pandemic level before 2025.
In March, there were regular flights from Tallinn to 33 destinations and the average occupancy of the flights was 72 
percent. At the end of March, regular connections to several summer destinations resumed: Air Baltic started flights 
to Nice on the French Riviera and the Turkish airline Sunexpress started seasonal flights to Antalya on the 
Mediterranean. Air Baltic and Ryanair had the most passengers, both with an equal 21 percent market share. Of 
charter flight destinations, flights continued to Egypt, the Canary Islands and Milan.
"The recovery of the number of passengers at Tallinn Airport is a particularly important achievement for us, 
because, according to the ACI report "Comparison of countries' air traffic with 2019", other airports in the region are 
10 to 28 percent lower than the pre-pandemic passenger numbers as of February," Eero Pargmae, member of the 
management board of Tallinn Airport, said.
The number of passengers at regional airports was 4,991 in March. The most passengers were served in 
Kuressaare, where compared to last year the number of passengers increased by 27 percent and a total of 3,460 
passengers were served, the vast majority of whom used regular flights between Tallinn and Kuressaare.
Altogether 1,026 passengers passed through Kardla airport, which makes it the month of March with the highest 
number of passengers in years. This was helped by the introduction of a larger aircraft on the Kardla-Tallinn route

at the beginning of the year. 263 passengers were served in Ruhnu, 169 passengers in Parnu and 72 passengers

Ryanair closing 7 routes from Tallinn
TALLINN, Mar 31, BNS – Low-cost carrier Ryanair has decided to close seven routes from Tallinn at the end of 
March and to continue to serve eight destinations from the capital of Estonia: London, Milan, Stockholm, Barcelona, 
Vienna, Berlin, Rome, and Venice Treviso.
"The closure of lines by Ryanair will not significantly affect our connectivity to the world, as almost half of our 
passengers fly via the major hubs -- Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt, Stockholm and Warsaw -- and new carriers will come 
to the destinations with stronger demand," Eero Pargmae, member of the management board of Tallinn Airport, 
said in a press release in February.
He said that of the services to be closed by Ryanair, also Air Baltic flies to Paris. Regarding other routes such as 
Billund, Dublin, Malta, Naples, Nuremberg and Paphos, Tallinn Airport will be negotiating with various airlines that 
might be interested in serving these routes.
Tallinn Airport switched to the summer schedule on March 26, offering travelers the choice of 47 direct-flight 
destinations from the Estonian capital this season, with regular flights operating to 33 destinations. Tickets are 
available to purchase on the websites of 14 airlines. There are also 14 charter destinations, tickets for which are 
available from travel agencies.
Summer 2023 will see Air Baltic launch four new routes from Tallinn: the seaside cities of Dubrovnik and Split in 
Croatia and the islands of Crete and Rhodes in Greece. The French city of Nice will also be returning to the flight

100 direct destinations to be available from Riga airport during summer season
RIGA, March 23 (LETA) - The summer flight season, which will begin on Sunday, March 26, will be launched at 
Riga Airport with 11 new destinations, LETA learned from the airport.
Passengers will have an opportunity to travel to 100 direct destinations from Riga, thus significantly expanding the 
range of connections from Riga, including two new destinations – Hanover in Germany and Gdansk in Poland.
“In this summer season, Riga is expected to offer ample travel opportunities for Latvian and Baltic travelers and 
attractive connections for passengers who will choose Riga Airport as a transfer point for their onward flights. 
Thanks to the many tourist destinations, the number of direct passengers at Riga Airport has approached the pre-
pandemic level, whereas the number of transit passengers will increase with new airBaltic routes such as Istanbul, 
Baku, Yerevan and others," said Laila Odina, Chairperson of the Airport Board.
This summer, Latvia's national carrier airBaltic will expand its range of services with ten new routes and increased 
frequencies on existing summer leisure and short break routes. From April 15, airBaltic will fly twice weekly on the 
route Riga–Hanover–Riga – a German city to which Riga has had no direct air connection until now. The new 
schedule will also include twice-weekly flights to Porto and Bilbao from May, and four-times-weekly flights to 
Istanbul from the beginning of April. In May, regular flights will also be launched to Bucharest, Burgas, Belgrade, 
Tivat, Yerevan and Baku.
On March 28, the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will start flights from Riga to the northern Polish city of Gdansk, with 
which there has been no direct air traffic before. Flights on this route are scheduled three times a week.
The Greek airline Aegean will return to the range of airlines in Riga in the upcoming summer season as a regular 
carrier with flights on the Riga–Athens route twice a week, starting from May 19.
100 direct destinations to be available from Riga airport during summer season
Thus, 15 carriers will operate at Riga Airport in the summer season of 2023. It is planned that in the first full week of 
the summer flight schedule, the number of passenger flights will increase by more than 10 percent as compared to 
the end of the winter season and will exceed 1,000 passenger flights per week.
As reported, 5.38 million passengers were served at Riga Airport in 2022, which is 2.3 times as many as a year 
before. Last year, the airport handled 54,818 flights, which is an increase of 40 percent against a year before. The 
number of passenger flights grew by 69 percent year-on-year to 48,427.
Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

Lithuania's BGS to continue fueling Ryanair planes in Vilnius, Palanga
VILNIUS, Mar 16, BNS - Baltic Ground Services (BGS), an international provider of ground handling, aircraft 
fueling, and logistics services, which is part of Lithuania's aviation group Avia Solutions Group, will continue 
providing Ryanair with into-plane fueling at Vilnius and Palanga Airports in Lithuania, ASG said on Thursday.
The Lithuanian group extended its 7-year cooperation and will provide fuel to Ryanair planes in Vilnius and Palanga 
Airport in Lithuania and the Leos Janacek Airport in the Czech Republic for one year from April 1.
Steven Fitzgerald, head of sustainability at Ryanair, says the company is satisfied with its long-standing cooperation 
with BGS.
BGS and Ryanair also extended their cooperation on into-plane fueling at Riga International Airport for another year 
in December.
BGS is a part of ASG which claims to be largest global ACMI (aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance) provider 
with more than 165 aircraft fleet, operating in all continents in the world.
The group earned 1 billion euros in revenue in 2021, up 46 percent from 2020, and its net profit stood at 34 million 
euros, from a loss of 52 million euros a year before.

Passenger numbers at Riga Airport up 62.5% in January-February
RIGA, March 7 (LETA) - Riga International Airport received 799,732 air passengers in the first two months of 2023, 
which is an increase of 62.5 percent against the same period last year, the airport informed, citing preliminary 
figures.
In January-February 2023, the airport handled 8,138 flights, an increase of 13 percent year-on-year, including 7,391 
passenger flights.
In February, Riga Airport received 385,000 passengers, which is 11 percent below the pre-pandemic figure. The 
number of direct passengers in February and the first two months of 2023 nearly reached the pre-pandemic level, 
staying 4 percent short of the respective period in 2019.
Meanwhile, 77,600 passengers used Riga Airport in February as a connecting airport to their further destinations, 
with the number of transit passengers lagging behind the 2019 figure by about one third due to geopolitical reasons.
Almost 198,000 passengers, or just over 50 percent, were carried by the national airline airBaltic in February, 
followed by the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair with 117,000 passengers.
Ireland, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Malta continued to dominate the list of the most popular destinations.
As reported, 5.38 million passengers were served at Riga Airport in 2022, which is 2.3 times as many as a year

Lithuanian-owned Avia Solutions Group moves head office to Ireland
VILNIUS, Mar 01, BNS – Avia Solutions Group (ASG), a global aviation business group controlled by Lithuanian 
businessman Gediminas Ziemelis, has moved its headquarters from Cyprus to Ireland.
ASG CEO Jonas Janukenas says the relocation is linked to the group's expansion plans for which Ireland is a more 
favorable country.
"Ireland is one of the aviation hubs, with many aviation companies headquartered here, so being closer to the 
aviation community will allow us to accelerate the group's expansion plans and maintain our leadership in the 
market," he said in a press release on Wednesday.
Another reason is that the company's financial instruments on the Dublin Stock Exchange have been bought by the 
world's largest institutional investors from the US and Europe.
The relocation makes ASG the second largest aviation company registered in Ireland, after Ryanair. The group has 
a workforce of around 11,000 employees and a fleet of 165 aircraft.

Lufthansa cancels flights to Vilnius due to German airport workers' strike
VILNIUS, Feb 17, BNS – Lufthansa on Friday cancelled flights between Vilnius and Frankfurt as workers at eight 
airports in Germany went on strike for better pay.
The affected flights are those scheduled to arrive in Vilnius at 2:40 p.m. and 11:35 p.m. on Friday and those 
scheduled to depart from the Lithuanian capital at 3:20 p.m. on Friday and before 7 a.m. on Saturday, Lietuvos Oro 
Uostai (Lithuanian Airports) told BNS.
Lufthansa has informed Vilnius Airport that the cancellations are due to technical reasons.
Also, Ireland's Ryanair on Friday cancelled its 7:20 a.m. flight from Bremen to Vilnius and the 11:35 a.m. return 
flight.
The AFP news agency has reported that the strike forced Germany's biggest carrier Lufthansa to cancel more than 
1,300 flights at its busiest hubs, Frankfurt and Munich, alone.
More than 700 planned landings and departures were cancelled at Munich Airport. At Frankfurt Airport, just 12 out 
of the 1,000 scheduled flights remained on the board, according to the agency.

Estonian diaspora in Ireland turns to PM re Ryanair stopping Tallinn-Dublin flights
TALLINN, Feb 09, BNS – In a public letter to Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Estonians living in Ireland note 
that Tallinn Airport's fee increase and Ryanair's subsequent decision to stop flights from Tallinn to Dublin will make 
coming home to visit very difficult, the daily Postimees writes.
In the letter, the diaspora notes that Tallinn Airport's decision and Ryanair's reaction to it mark a very painful 
fundamental life change for Estonians living in Ireland.
"Our appeal is a summary of the community members' week-long discussions, which shows how big the impact of a 
narrowly commercial decision is on Estonianness. The Estonian community in Ireland was formed after 2004. This 
is the largest group of new emigrants, where the traditions of previous generations of emigrants are absent," the 
signatories write.
"We are direct consumers of Estonian culture and therefore open and sensitive to the availability of communication 
opportunities in Estonian. Ryanair is a good example here. When cheap direct flights started in 2010 and ticket 
prices initially fell tenfold, the local social scene also slowly moved to the homeland. Now that there are no direct 
flights, a lot will change for us," they add.
Estonians in Ireland are faced with three concerns when visiting home by way of layover.
"Connecting flights with small children are a real logistical ordeal, unless you fly in business class, sending children 
home for the school holidays with a travel companion is over for now, and impulsive short visits to Estonia are put 
on hold for us as well as for Irish tourists," the Estonians living in Ireland write.
Estonian diaspora in Ireland turns to PM re Ryanair stopping Tallinn -Dublin flights
"All this means that we will no longer travel to Estonia with our family at every free opportunity. We will not bring 
grandparents over from Estonia to look after our children or go there to see our grandchildren. It is easier to 
organize this in Latvia or Italy," the diaspora adds.
According to the signatories, a seemingly small fiscal policy decision made in the administrative area of one ministry 
triggered an avalanche that affects many people's faith and trust in Estonia.
"In the case of similar decisions in the future, it might be worthwhile to carry out a wider impact analysis, to ask 
ministers what we will gain, what we will lose," they add.
Last week, low-cost carrier Ryanair announced that, due to an increase in airport fees, the airline will end flights 
from Tallinn on seven routes, including Dublin, at the end of March and continue flights to only eight destinations. In 
December, the low-cost airline stopped flights from Tallinn to Edinburgh and Liverpool.

Vilnius-Brussels direct flights set to resume in March – minister
VILNIUS, Feb 09, BNS – Brussels Airlines is set to resume its direct service between Vilnius and Brussels, 
temporarily suspended since last fall, in March and will offer more flights than before, Transport Minister Marius 
Skuodis said on Thursday.
"Brussels Airlines is coming back and, as far as I have been informed, there will even be more flights than before, 
because it is abnormal when we have no connections with EU capitals," he told the Lithuanian Social Democratic 
Party's political group in the parliament.
The minister said he did not know why the Belgian airline had suspended the service.
Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, LTOU) said last September that Brussels Airlines was suspending direct 
flights to Vilnius from October 28, but added that the carrier was planning to relaunch the service at the start of its 
next summer season in late March.
Ryanair offers direct flights between Kaunas and Charleroi Airport, more than 50 kilometers from the center of 
Brussels.

Estonian minister: Tallinn Airport's aviation activities should be self-sufficient
TALLINN, Feb 08, BNS - Commenting on the decision of Tallinn Airport to increase airport fees for airlines, 
Estonian Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Riina Sikkut said during parliament question time on 
Wednesday that the estimated loss from aviation-related activities for Tallinn Airport will be five million euros this 
year, while the segment should actually be self-sufficient.
Low-cost carrier Ryanair announced last week that, due to the increase in airport fees, it will end flights from Tallinn 
on seven routes at the end of March and continue flights to only eight destinations. Dara Brady, director of 
marketing and digital at Ryanair, told the daily that the new fees established by Tallinn Airport are excessive and 
make Tallinn uncompetitive compared to European airports.
Taivo Linnamagi, head of the aviation department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, said 
that the fees have not yet increased, and this can be done after the permission of the Competition Authority. The 
planned price increase is an average of three euros per departing passenger
Sikkut said during parliament question time that Ryanair has turned to the Competition Authority over the fee 
increase and the latter should provide its answer at the end of April.
"As to whether there is any way we could do without [the fee hike] -- aviation at Tallinn Airport has increasingly 
started generating a loss over the past couple of years. It can indeed be compensated to some extent by increasing 
parking fees, selling advertising and engaging in commercial activities on the Tallinn Airport premises. The 
estimated loss for the ongoing year already exceeds five million euros, and continuing such an activity is getting 
increasingly complicated. Aviation should be a self-sufficient, not a loss-making operation," the minister said.
Estonian minister: Tallinn Airport's aviation activities should be self-sufficient
Sikkut said that the state is not taking out a dividend from Tallinn Airport in 2023, 2024 or 2025 and instead 
prioritizes supplementary investments in new security gates or airport expansion.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is not interfering in the matter of airport fees, according to 
Sikkut.
"There are several different ways of doing things. Flight destinations, contract conditions or an increase in fee rates 
can also be determined by a decision of the minister. This isn't really how we do things in the Ministry of Economy 
and Communications. The airport has the expectation of the owner to ensure strategic connections and economic 
sustainability. It falls under the competence of the management how to do that, and I trust them. It is their right to 
agree on the rates with airlines and to implement them," she explained.

Riga Airport sees 68.5% rise in serviced passengers in January
RIGA, Feb 8 (LETA) - This past January, Riga International Airport serviced  414,577 passengers, with the number 
of direct passengers reaching 333,000 or just 3.9 percent below the indicator of the pre-pandemic period, the airport 
informed LETA.
In January, 4,355 flights were handled at the airport, of which 3,953 were passenger aircraft. Although, as 
compared to the number of aircraft handled in January 2019, the indicator this January showed a drop of one third, 
the number of seats offered to passengers on direct flights is just 13 percent lower than in 2019, with the airlines 
using larger capacity aircraft for the flights to and from Riga.
Of all the passengers carried in January, 51 percent flew with the national carrier airBaltic, but nearly 32 percent – 
with the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair.
The proportion of direct and transit passengers also remains stable: one fifth of the passengers use Riga Airport as 
a place of transfer.
“The beginning of this year has been successful for Riga Airport despite the fact that the first two months of the year 
usually mark the quietest season for airports. Seat occupancy rates on flights to and from Riga are high, around 70 
percent on average, but on certain flights to warmer destinations these rates approach 100 per ent. Forecasts of the 
carriers in relation to the upcoming months are stable and allow us to look at further recovery,'' says Laila Odina, 
Chairperson of the Board of Riga Airport.
As reported, in 2022, Riga Airport's passenger turnover amounted to 5.38 million passengers, which is an increase 
of almost 2.3 times as compared to 2021 when 2.35 million passengers were served at the airport.
Riga Airport sees 68.5% rise in serviced passengers in January
2022 also saw a 40 percent year-on-year increase in the number of flights to and from the airport, amounting to a 
total of 54,818 flights. Of these, 48,427 were passenger flights: an increase of 69 percent as compared to 28,694 
flights in 2021.
Riga Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltics.

Newspaper: Business model reason behind termination of some Ryanair flights from Tallinn
TALLINN, Feb 07, BNS – Low-cost carrier Ryanair announced last week that, due to the increase in airport fees, it 
will end flights from Tallinn on seven routes at the end of March and continue flights to only eight destinations, while 
in December it stopped flights from Tallinn to Edinburgh and Liverpool, the reason behind the termination of flights 
is the peculiarities of the company's business model, the Estonian daily Postimees writes.
Dara Brady, director of marketing and digital at Ryanair, told the daily that the new fees established by Tallinn 
Airport are excessive and make Tallinn uncompetitive compared to European airports.
According to the airline, it tried to reach an agreement with the airport, but to no avail. Instead, many airports are 
reducing their fees to regain their positions in the post-pandemic market.
"For example, Riga Airport waived the price increase. In Vilnius, where the fees were increased, we reduced the 
number of flights by 30 percent," Brady said.
Aviation expert and former director general of the Civil Aviation Administration Toomas Peterson said that the 
increase in airport fees by almost a third is frustrating.
"The expectations expressed by the minister of economic affairs, who represents the owner, for AS Tallinna 
Lennuajaam is firstly to ensure as many connections as possible from Tallinn and only as a second priority to 
ensure the efficiency of the company's operations," Peterson said.
Everything should be fine with the latter expectation: in the first nine months of last year, the airport made a net 
profit of 8.6 million euros, almost reaching the pre-pandemic level of 2019.
Newspaper: Business model reason behind termination of some Ryanair flights from Tallinn
"This fact should ensure the sustainability of the company and making the necessary investments. At the same 
time, the situation is bad when it comes to ensuring connections," Peterson said.
While last year it was possible to fly directly from Tallinn to 42 destinations, then by January of this year the number 
of regular routes had dropped to 32. The number may decrease even more after the closure of half of Ryanair's 
routes. However, for the summer, the airport predicts that it will be possible to fly from Tallinn with 14 airlines 
offering regular and five charter flight providers.
"This means that, together with charter flights, it will be possible to fly directly from Tallinn to 45 destinations," Riivo 
Tuvike, chairman of the management board of Tallinn Airport, said.
Next year, the number of destinations should increase to nearly 50.
According to Peterson, however, it will be difficult for the airport to stay competitive by raising fees.
"Ryanair, which is reacting very painfully to price increases, and perhaps others will therefore significantly reduce 
flights. Tallinn Airport is significantly smaller than its main competitors, Helsinki Vantaa and Riga, so each airline 
flying here has to be approached individually," he said.
Peterson added that the disappearance of direct connections also means more expensive flights.
"Air Baltic, which is subsidized by the Latvian state, is increasing its share at Tallinn Airport, but this is definitely not 
good for ticket prices," he said.
"We should be able to guarantee daily flights to at least 10 European hubs, which unfortunately requires state 
support. So far, we have invested more than 100 million euros in the bankrupt Estonian Air and Nordica, as a result 
of which, what a surprise, the latter is earning money in other markets," he added.
According to Tuvike, the price increase that started last year had a significant impact on the airport: utility and 
maintenance costs as well as the prices of services and products increased. The salaries of employees were 
increased by an average of 16 percent.
"The fees from aviation must also accompany other price increases," Tuvike said.
Although airlines have different business models, the airport must treat everyone equally.
"In May 2022, we proposed to carriers to increase airport fees, which have remained unchanged since 2009. 
Currently, 71 percent of our revenue comes from non-aviation sources, which has helped us emerge from the 
COVID-19 crisis and do so faster and stronger than many other airports. The new prices also allow us to remain 
competitive with our neighbors," Tuvike said.
According to him, Tallinn Airport is currently one of the cheapest in our region in terms of fees. Vilnius Airport raised 
fees by 28 percent and a price increase is also being considered at Riga Airport.
"More important than airport fees for each airline is the economic result of the route, that is the number of 
passengers on the route. Routes that pay off remain and those routes where the number of passengers is not 
sufficient throughout the year are closed," Tuvike said.
"Of course, airlines fight with airports over fees all over the world, but fees are usually not the reason why routes 
are closed -- especially if the new fees are still competitive," he added.
After the increase in fees in Tallinn, Riga Airport, from where people can fly directly to about 100 destinations, is 
almost a fifth cheaper. Vilnius Airport fees are slightly higher than those in Tallinn.
According to Tuvike, aviation recovered at a brisk pace last year and carriers began aggressively capturing 
markets.
Newspaper: Business model reason behind termination of some Ryanair flights from Tallinn
"The model of low-cost airlines is based on low costs and high occupancy expectations. If these are not achieved, 
then unfortunately, negative business decisions are made very quickly and aggressively," Tuvike said.
"Ryanair's goal is to make a profit of 1.4 billion euros this financial year. Four of the seven routes they are closing -- 
Billund, Naples, Nuremberg and Paris -- would continue to receive new route support, meaning the fees on these 
routes would not have increased," he added.
Ryanair's business model allows it to open and close routes quickly and almost every year the company opens or 
closes a route. This is the case both in Estonia and elsewhere in Europe.
"The previous experience of other airports shows that economically beneficial routes will be restored within a year 
or two. Time will tell whether this will also happen in Tallinn and whether it will happen this year or next year, but it 
is likely," Tuvike said.
Taivo Linnamagi, head of the aviation department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, said 
that the impact of the closure of Ryanair's routes on Tallinn connections is small, as almost half of the passengers 
fly through larger hubs.
According to Linnamagi, Tallinn Airport must be economically sustainable and self-sufficient. Currently, the fees 
have not yet increased, and this can be done after the permission of the Competition Authority.
"The planned price increase is an average of three euros per departing passenger, which should be considered 
within the total price of the plane ticket, meaning the effect of the fee on the price of the plane ticket is rather 
marginal considering its total price," he said.
Linnamagi also said that the state has set clear expectations for the airport.
"The airport's task is to ensure the best possible air connections, especially to strategically important destinations 
such as Helsinki, Stockholm, Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam. In addition, the owner also expects profitable and 
efficient management," he said.
The state has also supported Tallinn Airport every year -- for example, 6.76 million euros have been earmarked for 
covering security costs, 2.3 million euros for organizing the work of smaller airports -- Tartu, Kuressaare and others 
that also belong to Tallinn Airport -- and 500,000 euros for destination marketing. In 2023, the subsidies will be 
bigger by one million euros, meaning the state will cover security costs for 7.76 million euros.

Ryanair, Wizz Air appeal Vilnius Airport's new charges to court  (expands)
VILNIUS, Feb 06, BNS – Ireland's Ryanair and Hungary's Wizz Air have appealed to the court against Vilnius 
Airport's increased charges in place since the start of the year, but Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, LTOU), 
the airport's operator, says that both carriers often contest airport charges in other countries as well.
On January 20, the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court accepted for hearing the carriers' appeal against certain 
decisions by LTOU and the Lithuanian Transport Safety Administration (LTSA).
Ryanair and Wizz Air maintain that the LTOU director's July 22, 2022 order setting the new charges at Vilnius 
Airport and the LTSA director's December 15, 2022 order rejecting their appeal against the new charges are 
unfounded, the court said in a press release on Monday.
Last Friday, the court rejected the carriers' request to suspend the new charges until the court's decision becomes 
final.
LTOU said in a statement on Monday, "As far as we know, initiation of disputes, including in courts, in various 
countries to contest the level of airport charges is quite common for both appellants."
The airport operator believes that the air carriers' appeal is unfounded and hopes that it will be examined and 
rejected as soon as possible.
Ryanair said in late January that it was reducing its summer 2023 schedule at Vilnius Airport by 30 percent, 
scrapping two routes and cutting the number of flights on 11 others.
The move comes in response to Vilnius Airport's "illogical decision to increase its charges by a whopping 28 
percent, which makes flying to/from Vilnius more expensive and less competitive compared to the many other EU 
Ryanair, Wizz Air appeal Vilnius Airport's new charges to court  (expands)
airports that are lowering prices to recover traffic lost during COVID or are freezing charges to stimulate passenger 
growth", the Irish airline said in a press release.
Lithuanian Transport Minister Marius Skuodis said last week that Ryanair's decision to cut routes and flights, citing 
increased charges as the reason, is part of the Irish low-cost airline's usual tactic of pressure.
Aurimas Stikliunas, acting CEO of LTOU, has also told the 15min online news site that he regards Ryanair's move 
as public pressure.
European airports can review their pricing, which is regulated jointly by the European Union, on an annual basis, 
according to Stikliunas.
Wizz Air has made no announcement yet about how it will react to the increase in airport charges. On the contrary, 
the Hungarian airline in late January unveiled plans to expand its operations in Lithuania this year.

Number of flights in Lithuanian airspace up 1.2 pct in 2022
VILNIUS, Feb 02, BNS – Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation), the state-owned air navigation service provider, said on 
Thursday that it handled a total of 166,200 flights in Lithuanian airspace in 2022, a rise of 1.2 percent from 2021.
The total number of flights to Lithuanian airports jumped by 52 percent to 54,800 last year.
However, the number of overflights within Lithuanian airspace dropped by 13 percent to 111,300, accounting for 67 
percent of all flights, down from 78 percent in 2021.
The company attributed the decline to carriers having to bypass Russian airspace and adjust their routes due to 
sanctions.
According to Oro Navigacija CEO Saulius Batavicius, the company recorded a steep fall in overflights after the 
sanctions were imposed on Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in late February.
"Transit traffic, which grew by 80-90 percent in January-February 2022 compared to 2021, suddenly started to fall 
and did not recover for a single month until the end of the year," he said in a press release.
Turkish Airlines operated the largest number of overflights last year, accounting for 17.1 percent of all such flights, 
followed by Finnair with 12.5 percent, Latvia's Air Baltic with 6.1 percent, Russia's Aeroflot with 5.5 percent (in 
airspace over the open sea), and Ireland's Ryanair with 5 percent.
Flight numbers rose by 52 percent to 36,500 at Vilnius Airport, by 53 percent to 10,400 at Kaunas Airport, by 54 
percent to 4,200 Siauliai Airport, and by 92 percent to 3,700 at Palanga Airport.
Number of flights in Lithuanian airspace up 1.2 pct in 2022  
Ryanair operated the largest number of flights to and from Lithuania, at 14,000, or 25.7 percent of all flights, 
followed by Air Baltic with 6,300 (11.5 percent), Wizz Air with 5,100 (9.3 percent), LOT Poland with 3,300 (6.1 
percent), and Sweden's SAS with 2,700 (4.8 percent).

Ryanair to close 7 routes from Tallinn
TALLINN, Feb 01, BNS – Low-cost carrier Ryanair has decided to close seven routes from Tallinn at the end of 
March and to continue to serve eight destinations from the capital of Estonia: London, Milan, Stockholm, Barcelona, 
Vienna, Berlin, Rome, and Venice Treviso.
"The closure of lines by Ryanair will not significantly affect our connectivity to the world, as almost half of our 
passengers fly via the major hubs -- Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt, Stockholm and Warsaw -- and new carriers will come 
to the destinations with stronger demand," Eero Pargmae, member of the management board of Tallinn Airport, 
said in a press release.
Of the services to be closed by Ryanair, also Air Baltic flies to Paris. Regarding other routes such as Billund, Dublin, 
Malta, Naples, Nuremberg and Paphos, Tallinn Airport will be negotiating with various airlines that might be 
interested in serving these routes.
"The aviation market is showing signs of a stabilization of the post-COVID boom. The reasons cited include 
weakening performance of routes, rising costs and a shortage of aircraft, as both Boeing and Airbus are currently 
unable to supply airlines with the promised number of new aircraft," Pargmae added.
In the summer 2023 season, there will be direct flights from Tallinn Airport to nearly 50 destinations, operated by 15 
airlines.

Ryanair's decision to cut flights in Vilnius is usual pressure tactic – minister
VILNIUS, Jan 31, BNS – Ryanair's decision to cut routes and flights from Vilnius Airport, citing increased charges 
as the reason, is part of the Irish low-cost airline's usual tactic of pressure, Lithuanian Transport Minister Marius 
Skuodis said on Tuesday, adding that this creates an opportunity for other carriers to offer more routes.
"It is common practice for this company to exert public pressure," Skuodis told reporters at Vilnius Airport. "It is 
done in Berlin, London and Brussels airports, all over Europe, and it is not something unusual."
"I hope this will be an opportunity for other airlines to increase the number of destinations," the minister said.
"When it comes to national aviation, the aim is not to be too dependent on any single airline, so that we have a 
sufficient number of diverse routes," he added.
Aurimas Stikliunas, acting CEO of Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, LTOU), also told the 15min online news 
site on Monday that he regarded Ryanair's move as public pressure.
European airports can review their pricing, which is regulated jointly by the European Union, on an annual basis, 
according to Stikliunas.
Some European airports raised their charges last year as traveler flows recovered. However, Lithuanian airports 
had not increased their charges for several years to encourage airlines to recover their passenger levels, he said.
Ryanair has said recently that it is reducing its summer 2023 schedule at Vilnius Airport by 30 percent, scrapping 
two routes and cutting the number of flights on 11 others.

Ryanair cuts 2 Vilnius routes, frequency on 11 others
VILNIUS, Jan 30, BNS – Ireland's low-cost carrier Ryanair has said that it is reducing its summer 2023 schedule at 
Vilnius Airport by 30 percent, scrapping two routes and cutting the number of flights on 11 others.
The move comes in response to "Vilnius Airport's illogical decision" to increase its charges by 28 percent from 
January 1, 2023, the airline said in a press release.
The cuts were "caused solely by Vilnius Airport's illogical decision to increase its charges by a whopping 28 
percent, which makes flying to/from Vilnius more expensive and less competitive compared to the many other EU 
airports that are lowering prices to recover traffic lost during COVID or are freezing charges to stimulate passenger 
growth", said Dara Brady, director of marketing, digital and communications at Ryanair.
From late March, the airline will stop operating its routes from Vilnius to Birmingham and Leeds-Bradford, and will 
cut the frequency of flights to Athens, Berlin, Billund, Corfu, Dublin, Frankfurt, Gdansk, London Stansted, Milan, 
Venice and Vienna.
Marius Zelenius, spokesman for Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, LTOU), told BNS that the company 
received Ryanair's official notification of its plans to cut the number and frequency of flights late on Friday evening.
"As far as we know, the two routes mentioned in the announcement, to Birmingham and Leeds-Bradford, had 
already been officially cancelled earlier. They are scheduled to operate until the end of March," Zelenius said.
"We have not received any similar notifications from other airlines," he added.
Zelenius said Vilnius Airport had last revised its charges back in 2018, adding that the latest rise was due to 
increased costs.
Ryanair cuts 2 Vilnius routes, frequency on 11 others
The aviation pricing model at EU airports is regulated by the European Commission and has to be based on costs 
and investments, so the charges are calculated according to certain formulas, according to the spokesman.

Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers for December up 24 pct on year
TALLINN, Jan 05, BNS – A total of 207,555 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in December 2022, which is 
24 percent more than in the same month the year before.
In the full-year, the airport served 2,747,943 passengers.
Riivo Tuvike, CEO of the state-owned airport company AS Tallinna Lennujaam, said the past year will be 
remembered as a year of rapid recovery, which brought people back to airports after several years.
"At the beginning of 2022, we set ourselves a target of 2.5 million passengers, but we exceeded that number 
already in November, and in the full-year, 2.7 million passengers passed through Tallinn Airport, which marks an 
increase by more than half over 2021. In 2022, flight operations numbered  38,044, which is an average of 104 
take-offs and landings per day," Tuvike said in a press release.
Regional airports were also doing well, according to the CEO. In March, Finnair resumed the air service between 
Tartu and Helsinki, which was unfortunately discontinued in October, and international air connections from the 
airport of Parnu were relaunched after several years. In total, 63,946 passengers passed through regional airports 
during the year and 9,987 flight operations were performed. Of regional airports, Kuressaare served the most 
passengers, clocking in a new all-time high of 38,749 passengers for the full-year.
Air Baltic and Ryanair served the biggest numbers of passengers, accounting for 22 percent of passengers each. 
During the year, scheduled flights were operated to a total of 42 destinations, plus regular charter flights to holiday 
destinations. In December, there were regular direct flights to 33 destinations. The biggest proportion of 
passengers, about 40 percent, flew to the major hubs Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt, Stockholm and Warsaw.
According to the CEO, the airport company continued to engage in construction and development activities in order 
to provide passengers with a home-like and digital environment. In June, self-service baggage drop-off was 
Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers for December up 24 pct on year
launched for Air Baltic and SAS passengers, and in September, a new gates area with a self-service shop was 
opened. A new modern and fully automatic baggage sorting system, located away from the eyes of passengers, 
has turned Tallinn into a modern, state-of-the-art airport, he said.
In addition, reducing the carbon footprint remains a key priority for the company, which continued to build solar 
parks and switched to district heating, reducing its carbon footprint by 20 percent.
"We joined the Green Tiger collaboration platform and were one of the founding members of Hydrogen Valley 
Estonia, launched the first airport green forum, started a green mornings initiative involving the airport's community, 
and participated in World Cleanup Day with our partners," Tuvike added.

euros in the same period last year. The group's net profit for the nine months surged by 50.1 percent to 55 million 
euros, and EBITDA came in at 242 million euros.
The group says 80 percent of its revenue is generated in Western Europe, ten percent in Asia and five percent in 
North America, and around 6,500 out of almost 9,500 employees are based in Western Europe and the US.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers up by quarter on year in November
TALLINN, Dec 05, BNS – A total of 206,786 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in November, 26 percent 
more than during the same month last year.
In November, scheduled flights from Tallinn were operated to 33 destinations and the average load factor of flights 
was 68 percent, the state-owned airport company AS Tallinna Lennujaam said. The biggest numbers of passengers 
used the Helsinki, Riga and Frankfurt services. In terms of countries, the highest numbers of passengers traveled to 
or from Germany, on the Frankfurt, Munich, Nuremberg and Berlin direct flights. The choice of direct routes is 
largest between Estonia and Italy, with regular services from Tallinn available to Rome, Milan, Naples, Venice and 
Treviso.
In November, 12 airlines offered regular services from Tallinn and the largest numbers of passengers used Ryanair 
and Air Baltic flights: 22.6 percent and 21.9 percent of passengers, respectively. Two new routes were added to the 
flight schedule -- Ryanair started flights to Treviso, Italy and Wizz Air to Luton Airport, London.
When it comes to charter flights, the Turkey tourist season was coming to an end. As a result, charter flights were 
operated mainly to Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.
Eero Pargmae, board member of AS Tallinna Lennujaam, described the passenger statistics for November as very 
positive.
"The switch to the winter schedule always means a seasonal drop in passenger numbers, but we are very pleased 
with this November. Against a backdrop of high inflation and high heating costs, we are pleased to see that people 
and businesses continue to have resources also for travel. We very much hope that by the end of 2022, 2.7 million 
passengers will have used Tallinn Airport's services," Pargmae said in a press release.

Tsikhanouskaya: No greater sanction for Putin than a free Belarus
TALLINN, Oct 24, BNS – Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said before the Estonian 
parliament on Monday that the biggest sanction for Putin would be a free Belarus and without a free Belarus there 
would be no safe Ukraine and no safe Europe.
"It is an honor for me to speak on behalf of Belarusians, who have been fighting for their freedom, independence 
and European future for more than two years,” Tsikhanouskaya said. She thanked Estonians for their support and 
help, and asked for Estonia’s support in international organizations.
"My country is actually under occupation, held hostage by two bloodthirsty dictators," she added. "Despite the 
unprecedented terror, Belarusians have continued their struggle for more than two years. Many thousands paid with 
their freedom, and some with their lives. With their struggle, Belarusians proved that they deserve to live in a 
democratic country," Tsikhanouskaya said.
She pointed out that today the fate of Belarus was strongly connected with the fate of Ukraine. She noted that after 
the start of the war, one and a half thousand people signed up as volunteers and took part in the counteroffensive 
of the Ukrainian army. The Russians have so far failed to involve the Belarusian military in the war -- this is 
evidence of strong public resistance. According to her, more than 90 percent of Belarusians are against joining the 
war, despite the propaganda.
The leader of the Belarusian opposition encouraged to continue supporting Ukraine, saying that support for Ukraine 
was help for free Belarus. "Nothing will be a greater sanction for Putin than a free Belarus," Tsikhanouskaya said. 
She added that without a free Belarus, there would be no safe Ukraine and no security in Europe. She called on 
continuing sanctions against Russia and Belarus.
Tsikhanouskaya: No greater sanction for Putin than a free Belarus
Tsikhanouskaya underlined that Lukashenko must bear responsibility for the hijacking of the Ryanair plane, the 
artificial migration crisis and crimes against humanity, and an international tribunal should be established against 
Lukashenko and Putin. "We need to unite again to free Europe from tyrants," she added.
Before addressing the members of the Riigikogu, Tsikhanouskaya met with parliament speaker Juri Ratas, who 
assured the leader of the Belarusian democratic opposition of Estonia’s full support for the aspirations of the people 
of Belarus for a free and democratic future.
Tsikhanouskaya also had meetings with chairman of the foreign affairs committee Marko Mihkelson and Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Urmas Reinsalu. On Tuesday, Tsikhanouskaya will meet with President Alar Karis and the Riigikogu 
support group for democracy and citizens’ rights and freedoms in Belarus.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's winter schedule to include 40 direct flights
TALLINN, Oct 11, BNS – Tallinn Airport will be making the transition to its winter schedule at the end of October, 
which will mean a choice of 40 destinations to which it will be possible to fly direct from Tallinn.
They include daily flights to London, with the British capital now being served by three airlines. Winter will also see 
the resumption of regular flights to Cyprus, and the Dublin route is now open year-round, the airport company said.
Traditionally, the winter season brings fewer flights than summer, which means less hectic and more comfortable 
travel for passengers. "Our winter schedule has something for everyone, whether they are interested in taking a city 
break, going on a skiing trip or escaping to warmer climates," Eero Pargmae, a member of the management board 
of Tallinn Airport, said.
The choice of destinations for city breaks includes some of Europe’s biggest drawcards -- Berlin, London, Paris and 
Rome. 2But places like Vienna, Nuremberg and Istanbul are also ripe for exploring," Pargmae said. He added that 
the winter schedule features as many as seven destinations for winter sports lovers. 2Anyone thinking of hitting the 
ski slopes can choose to fly to Salzburg, Milan, Munich, Zurich, Nuremberg, Vienna or Venice Treviso, all of which 
are well connected to some of the best resorts in Europe," he said.
Package tourism also remains popular, with charter flights to Tenerife, Hurghada and Sharm El-Sheikh. "Trips to 
those resorts can be booked through travel agents," Pargmae said, adding that Ryanair will be resuming flights to 
the Cypriot city of Paphos for the winter season.
Although the peak season for travel has passed, Pargmae said that people remain as interested in travelling as 
ever. "The enormous queues we saw in European airports in summer are now largely under control and the quality 
of flight services is recovering rapidly," he said. "We have all drawn conclusions from the lessons we learned this 
summer, and preparations for disruption-free winter and summer 2023 schedules are already being made."

million passengers by the end of 2022," Pargmae said in a press release.
"We're continuously contributing to improving the airport service so that passengers should be comfortable while 
waiting to board their flight and that they should feel at home at the world's coziest airport. In September, we 
opened a new boarding area on ground zero of the passenger terminal where we can service up to 400 passengers 
at once. Next year we're also planning to build an extension in order to better service non-Schengen flights," he 
added.
In September, direct flights were operated on 35 regular routes, with passengers traveling most to major hubs 
Helsinki, Stockholm and Riga. The average passenger load factor on regular flights was 74 percent. 16 percent of 
all passengers used charter flights, mainly to Antalya, but also to Greek islands and Montenegro. The most popular

"I want to remind people that during peak hours and school holidays in particular, security lines may be longer; thus, 
we recommend that everyone get to the airport two hours before their departure," Pargmae noted.

VILNIUS, Sep 15, BNS – Brussels Airlines, the only carrier operating direct flights from Lithuania to Brussels, has 
confirmed that it is discontinuing its service between Vilnius and the Belgian capital from October 28, the 15min 
online news site reported on Thursday.
"Due to low demand between Brussels and Vilnius during the winter season, these flights will not be operated 
during this period," the airline has told the website. "Since demand for such flights was low, the number of affected 
customers was also low."
That will leave Ryanair's flight between Kaunas and Charleroi Airport, more than 50 kilometers from the center of 
Brussels, as the only direct route between Belgium and Lithuania.

Tallinn Airport passenger numbers up 61 pct on year in August
TALLINN, Sep 05, BNS – A total of 286,627 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in August 2022, which is the 
highest number of passengers served by the airport in one month since the fall of 2019 and represents an increase 
of  61 percent over August 2021, the state-owned airport company announced on Monday.
In the first eight months of the year, nearly 1.8 million passengers passed through the airport, three times more than 
during the same period last year.
Tallinn Airport Management Board Member Eero Pargmae said the airport's employees have done their best to 
serve the rapidly growing passenger numbers this summer season.
"The average waiting time to pass security checks has also decreased from month to month, being 14 minutes in 
June, 11 minutes in July and nine minutes in August. Of course, queues were longer at peak times and the waiting 
time for security checks could be up to an hour then," he said.
According to Pargmae, the amount of time needed to go through the security check will be longer at the peak times 
also in the future. The peak times at Tallinn Airport are the early morning, the early afternoon, and the late evening.
The load factor of scheduled flights remained high in August at an average of 80 percent. In August, direct flights to 
Georgia were reopened, with Wizz Air flying to the city of Kutaisi twice a week.
Scheduled flights were operated on 35 routes in August, and passenger numbers were largest  on the routes to the 
most important hubs for Estonian passengers -- Riga, Stockholm and Helsinki. In terms of total passenger numbers, 
these destinations were followed by Antalya, predominantly a destination for charter flights. Charter flights were 
operated to seven destinations, including to resort towns in Montenegro, Greece and Bulgaria.
Tallinn Airport passenger numbers up 61 pct on year in August

passengers, Tartu was in third place with 1,215 and Parnu fourth with 319 passengers.
The increase in the numbers of people traveling to Kuressaare and Kardla has been supported by the popularity of 
domestic tourism. According to the airport company, the Tartu-Helsinki route's load factor will be improved by the 
winter timetable, which will create better opportunities for switching to connecting flights in Helsinki.
At the airport of Parnu, the last seasonal scheduled flights to Helsinki and Stockholm were operated in August.

Riga Airport sees almost three-fold increase in turnover in H1
RIGA, Sep 2, BNS - The turnover of Riga International Airport in the first half of this year was EUR 25.148 million, 
which is 2.7 times more than in the corresponding period of 2021, while the airport's losses decreased several 
times - to EUR 5,535, according to Firmas.lv information.
The management report explains that the turnover in the first half of 2022 exceeded the planned turnover by 25 
percent.
The airport's income from aviation services in the first six months of this year amounted to EUR 16.076 million, 
which is EUR 3.097 million or 24 percent more than planned, while the income from non-aviation services 
amounted to EUR 9.072 million, which is EUR 1.985 million or 28 percent more than planned.
Meanwhile, the airport's losses in the first half of the year was EUR 7.029 million less than projected.
The management report explained that this result was positively influenced by higher turnover in both aviation and 
non-aviation revenue positions. The increase in turnover is basically explained by the direct increase in the number 
of passengers, which was also facilitated by the opening of a base by the Irish airline Ryanair at the airport in 
November 2021.
The management report states that the first half of the year marked the recovery trend of aviation services at the 
airport. Despite the war started by Russia in Ukraine, and the fact that Latvian airspace is closed to aircraft 
connected to Russia and Belarus, as well as there is no air traffic with Ukraine, the total number of passengers 
served and the number of flights have increased compared to 2021. On the other hand, there is a decline in the 
aviation cargo segment, which is related to the suspension of cargo transportation from China in connection with 
the sanctions imposed on cargo carriers and their aircraft - airspace closure.
Riga Airport sees almost three-fold increase in turnover in H1
Riga International Airport received 2.21 million air passengers in the first half of 2022, which is 5.5 times the number 
served over the same period a year ago, according to the airport's operating data.
In the first six months of 2022, Riga Airport also handled 25,000 flights, which is 2.2 times more than in the first six 
months of last year, while the airport's cargo turnover dropped 11.2 percent year-on-year from the same period in 
2021 to 10,970 tons.
In the first half of last year, Riga Airport posted EUR 9.418 million in turnover and EUR 9.405 million in losses.
Riga Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

It’s almost impossible for regime-fleeing Belarusians get humanitarian visas – opposition
VILNIUS, Aug 09, BNS - Belarusians fleeing the Lukashenko regime can only enter Lithuania illegally as they no 
longer have access to humanitarian Lithuanian visas, representatives of the Belarusian opposition say.
"After Lukashenko hijacked the Ryanair plane, it's practically impossible to get an EU visa while being in Belarus," 
Olga Karach, a Belarusian opposition representative and a member of the human rights organization Our House, 
told a press conference in Vilnius on Tuesday.
In her words, almost all EU countries have reduced their representation in Minsk to a minimum following the forced 
landing of the Ryanair passenger plane that was en route from Athens to Vilnius in May, 2020.
"Lithuania does not issue any visas at all," she said. "Belarusians have to flee illegally across the border."
The fall conscription of young men is starting in Belarus, Karach said, adding that young Belarusians might end up 
in prison if they refuse to serve in the army, and it's now difficult to escape the country.
"Today, for example, to get a Polish humanitarian visa, you have to pay speculators 500 US dollars or more just to 
register for an appointment. In some cases, the amount is as high as 1,500 US dollars. Just to register for a visit," 
Karach said.
She says such a situation is also weakening resistance to the Lukashenko regime in the country.
"Underground activities in Belarus could be more active but people realize that if they faced detention, they would 
simply not be able to escape, not be able to get visas and not be able to leave," Karach said.
It’s almost impossible for regime-fleeing Belarusians get humanitarian visas – opposition
Also attending the press conference, Belarusian opposition activist Veranika Tsepkala did not hide her 
disappointment with the work of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's office in Vilnius. She says no tangible results have 
been achieved over the past two years, the opposition's actions are not coordinated, and there's a lack of 
transparency in the financial activities.
"We were surprised that despite the fact that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's office has been operating in Lithuania for 
two years, Lithuania has not recognized Lukashenko as a terrorist. The Forum of Democratic Forces of Belarus has 
sent a letter to put this issue on the parliament's agenda and to discuss it", she said. "We believe that by putting 
pressure on Lukashenko from all sides, we will achieve certain results."
Tsepkala also asked Lithuania to open a criminal case against Lukashenko and to take up the initiative to bring him 
before an international court for crimes against humanity.
Tuesday marks the second anniversary of democratic protests in Belarus.
On August 9, 2020, Belarus held a presidential election. Mass protests erupted in the country following the 
announcement that authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has led the country since 1994, had won 
again.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport services over 282,000 passengers in July
TALLINN, Aug 02, BNS – Altogether 282,559 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in July, 78 percent more 
than during the same month last year.
The figure accounted for 88 percent of the pre-pandemic level, Tallinn Airport said.
Member of the management board of Tallinn Airport Eero Pargmae said that the number of passengers in July was 
very good, but the recovery of the number of passengers to the pre-crisis level is affected by the resolution of 
logistical problems caused by the general understaffing of European airports.
"While the situation in aviation has generally stabilized, flight schedule changes, flight cancellations and delays still 
occur. Therefore, it is important that passengers follow the flight plans and notifications from the airline and contact 
their airline in case of changes to the flight plan," Pargmae said.
Pargmae stressed that, although the average time of going through security at Tallinn Airport was less than 15 
minutes in the last weeks of July, the two-hour rule still applies. "Since the flight occupancy rate is very high in 
summer, it also takes more time to check in passengers for the flight. In order for all operations at the airport to be 
completed on time and to have time to enjoy the start of the trip, we recommend arriving two hours before 
departure. In addition, we recommend flying more with direct flights and, if possible, taking hand luggage that is 
packed correctly," he added.
Pargmae reminded that from July, all passengers who fly with Air Baltic or SAS and have check-in luggage can 
independently check it in and thus get to the flight faster. "Self-service baggage drop-off points are located at 
check-in desks 1-4, and to use them, the passenger must have checked in online. Baggage can be dropped off 
through the self-service system up to 24 hours before departure and the self-service is open between 4 a.m. and 9 
p.m.," he said.

In July, there were flights on 35 regular routes operated by 14 airlines. The largest number of passengers flew to 
major hubs in Riga, Helsinki and Frankfurt. The average occupancy rate of scheduled flights was 82 percent in July. 
Antalya was still the most popular holiday destination.
The largest carriers were Air Baltic with a 25 percent market share and Ryanair with a 22 percent share. 9 percent 
of passengers flew with Lufthansa and 8 percent with Finnair. In July, there were 3,513 flight operations, making an 
average of 113 landings and take-offs per day.
From January to July, a total of 1,486,536 passengers have passed through Tallinn Airport, which is more than in 
the entire year of 2021. A total of 36,080 passengers have passed through regional airports in the seven months.
In July, a total of 7,724 passengers passed through regional airports. Altogether 4,170 passengers passed through 
Kuressaare Airport on Estonia's large western island of Saaremaa, which was 3 percent more than in July last year. 
Kardla Airport on the island of Hiiumaa serviced 1,450 passengers and Tartu Airport in South Estonia 1,190 
passengers.
The airport in the southwestern resort town of Parnu saw 914 passengers in July, 75 percent of whom travelled on 
the Helsinki route.  A seasonal air link with Stockholm was opened in Parnu in June with the route operated twice a 
week by SAS. There were no commercial flights from Parnu and Tartu in July of last year.

Riga Airport receives 2.2 million passengers in H1
RIGA, Jul 6, BNS - Riga International Airport received 2.2 million air passengers in the first half of 2022, which is 
5.4 times the number served over the same period a year ago, according to the airport's operating data.
In the first six months of 2022, Riga Airport also handled 25,481 flights, which is 2.2 times more than in the first six 
months of last year, while the airport's cargo turnover dropped 11 percent year-on-year and 18 percent from the 
same period in 2019 to 11,000 tons.
In June 2022, Riga Airport received nearly 550,000 passengers and handled 5,045 flights. Compared to June 2021, 
the number of passengers was nearly 3.5 times higher but 28 percent below the number reported for June 2019.
Riga Airport CEO Laila Odina indicated that the industry's recovery from the pandemic is still going quite fast. The 
airport's June results were less than a third below the results shown before the pandemic.
"Although the share of transit passengers in Riga has dropped from 30 percent to 17 percent since the ban on 
Russia and Belarus routes, we have managed to compensate this decrease with a vast and convenient range of 
summer destinations, which is already very close to what we were offering before the pandemic," Odina said, 
adding that the airport also made sure it had the necessary staff and that the airport was already employing more 
people than before the pandemic.
In June 2022, Latvia's airBaltic was the leading carrier operating at Riga Airport, as the national airline carried 
279,000 people, or half of all passengers served at the airport. airBaltic also operated 2,713 flights to and from the 
airport, or 53 percent. Ireland's low-costs carrier Ryanair followed with 971 flights, or 20 percent.
Meanwhile, the turnover of air cargo was still affected by the war in Ukraine and international flight restrictions. In 
June, Riga Airport handled 1,449 tons of air cargo.

In 2021, Riga Airport received 2.353 million passengers, which is an increase of 17 percent against 2020 but 70 
percent below the result achieved in 2019.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport services over 281,000 passengers in June
TALLINN, Jul 05, BNS - Over 281,000 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in June, almost three times as 
much as during the same month last year, however, the number only accounted for 87 percent of the pre-pandemic 
level.
The average load factor on flights was nearly 80 percent in June, demonstrating continued very broad-based 
demand, according to the airport.
Member of the management board of Tallinn Airport Eero Pargmae said that the tourism sector and aviation are 
bouncing back as reliable and strong employers, however, the long process of training and restoring competences 
has resulted in a complicated situation in the entire aviation sector.
"Compared with Europe, the situation is quite good in Estonia. We're making a great effort with G4S and our other 
partners to continuously improve staffing," Pargmae said in a press release, adding that the difficult situation in 
Europe is likely to persist until the end of the current summer season.
"The quality of service should improve in October and November due to the arrival of low season from the 
perspective of aviation; the number of passengers will decrease and the opportunity will arise to focus on 
preparations for the next summer. Last winter, when there seemed to be no end to the coronavirus, airports and air 
carriers did not dare to actively start recruiting employees. Uncertainty was further aggravated by war breaking out 
at the end of February. At the same time time, we're now seeing passenger numbers about to bounce back to pre-
coronavirus pandemic levels and the sector must quickly restore the same service provision capability it had before 
the crisis," Pargmae said.
The most popular destination from Tallinn in June was Antalya with close to 25,000 passengers transported to the 
Turkish resort city on regular and chartered flights.  Flights from Tallinn to Antalya depart up to five times per day. 
Flights to major hubs such as Helsinki, Frankfurt and Riga likewise saw large passenger volumes.
Estonia : Tallinn Airport services over 281,000 passengers in June
Broken down by air carriers, Air Baltic and Ryanair saw the largest numbers of customers, having each serviced 
one-fifth of the total number of passengers. Air Baltic services 13 direct routes from Tallinn and Ryanair 15. The 
most popular charter flights were those linking Tallinn with coastal cities in Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria as well as 
with Tivat in Montenegro.
In the past six months, Tallinn Airport has serviced 1.2 million passengers. During the same period in 2021, the 
corresponding number was 283,000.
"We want to remind passengers that it is the high season for air travel and queues may still occur at Tallinn Airport 
during peak hours, thus, we recommend that all passengers arrive at the airport two hours before their flight 
departs," Pargmae said. Considering the difficult situation in European aviation and airports, Tallinn Airport 
recommends that people be prepared for the unexpected, opt for direct flights if possible and definitely obtain travel 
interruption insurance before their trip.
Kuressaare Airport on Estonia's large western island of Saaremaa serviced 3,591 passengers in June and Kardla 
Airport on Hiiumaa island 1,294 passengers, marking increases by 18 percent and 5 percent on year, respectively. 
1,234 passengers traveled through Tartu Airport, most of whom used the regular air link with Helsinki. Parnu Airport 
served 437 passengers who likewise mainly traveled on the Helsinki route. A seasonal air link with Stockholm was 
opened in Parnu in June with the route operated twice a week by SAS. There were no commercial flights from 
Parnu and Tartu last year.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's May passenger numbers highest served in 1 month in last 2.5 yrs
TALLINN, Jun 03, BNS – In May, 271,484 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport, the highest number of 
passengers served in a single month in the last two and a half years and representing 90 percent of the pre-
pandemic level.
In May, there were regular flights on 34 routes. The largest number of passengers used direct connections to the 
hubs in Helsinki, Frankfurt and Riga, as well as to Stockholm and Warsaw. In May, the average load factor for 
scheduled flights was 71 percent. Nearly 13 percent of all passengers used charter flights, mainly to Antalya but 
also to resorts in Greece, Tunisia, Montenegro and Portugal, the airport said in a press release.
Ryanair was the airline with the biggest market share, as it had 15 routes from Tallinn and carried 22 percent of all 
passengers. Air Baltic flew on 13 routes and served 21 percent of passengers. Altogether 29 percent of passengers 
flew with budget airlines.
In May, there were 3,652 flight operations, which is an average of 118 landings and take-offs per day.

"Long queues at airports across Europe caused by the rapid growth in passenger numbers and staff shortages 
have been widely reported in the media in recent weeks. We and our partners alike are working every day to recruit 
new staff and to continue to provide a high quality service. However, to ensure that everyone’s journey starts as 
smoothly and pleasantly as possible, we urge everyone to arrive at the airport at least two hours before departure.

Riga Airport raises turnover 7% in 2021
RIGA, May 27, BNS - Riga International Airport's turnover amounted to EUR 31.769 million last year, an increase of 
6.7 percent from 2020, while the airport's losses decreased 40.7 percent to EUR 9.423 million, according to 
Firmas.lv.
A loss of EUR 9.4 million represents EUR 10 million below the amount planned in the last year's budget, Riga 
Airport's representatives told BNS. The planned loss was reduced mainly due to higher turnover in both aviation 
and non-aviation revenue positions and targeted cost reductions.
The airport's turnover last year was 12 percent higher than projected, but only half of the turnover in 2019, when the 
airport turned over nearly EUR 65 million.
More than half of the revenue, EUR 18.9 million, was generated by aviation services, which is an increase of 8 
percent as compared to the planned budget. This increase under conditions of reduced number of flights and 
passengers was mainly achieved because of a relatively small decrease in the direct passenger segment, which 
provides the airport with significantly higher revenue than service of transit passengers, as well as higher-than-
expected revenue was generated from the growth in cargo flights, opening of the Ryanair base and other factors.
In turn, revenue from non-aviation services amounted to EUR 12.9 million or 20 percent above the budgeted 
amount.
Last year, Riga Airport invested EUR 6.7 million, including in the development of power supply, passenger and 
aircraft handling, aerodrome, and airport territorial infrastructure, which will be particularly important as the aviation 
industry recovers from the impact of the pandemic.
"The year of 2021 showed our ability to adapt to the changing situation by swiftly reviewing and organizing our daily 
work processes, employee and financial resources both in the first half of the year, when the airport was operating 
Riga Airport raises turnover 7% in 2021
in the survival mode, and in the second half of the year, when numbers of passengers rose sharply again after the 
lifting of travel restrictions and the introduction of the EU Digital Travel Certificate," said the airport's CEO Laila 
Odina.
In 2021, the airport continued to finance its economic activities partly with state aid - EUR 35.2 million increase in 
the Airport's share capital and exemption from the dividend payment for the financial year 2019 in the amount of 
EUR 4.5 million. These funds were received in June 2021.
As reported, Riga Airport handled 2.353 million passengers in 2021, which is an increase of 17 percent as 
compared to 2020 but a 70 percent drop from 2019.
Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

Minsk regime continues on path of strengthening dictatorship – Lithuanian parlt speaker
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – The Minsk regime continues on its path of strengthening its dictatorship, Viktorija Cmilyte-
Nielsen, the speaker of the Lithuanian parliament, said on Tuesday.
Her comment comes a year after Ryanair's Vilnius-bound flight from Athens was diverted by the regime to Belarus' 
capital.
Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian blogger, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were detained after the plane landed in 
Minsk. Sapega, a Russian citizen who studied in Vilnius at that time, was sentenced by a Belarusian court in early 
May to six years in prison.
"Belarus [...] has continued all these years on the path of strengthening the dictatorship of [Alexander] Lukashenko," 
Cmilyte-Nielsen told reporters.
According to the speaker, Lithuania is constantly watching the situation in the neighboring country and supporting 
Belarusians "under the dictator's yoke".
Belarus' opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya is to address the Lithuanian parliament later on Tuesday to 
mark the anniversary of the forced landing of the Ryanair flight.
She fled to Lithuania after Belarus' August 2020 presidential election, in which Lukashenko claimed victory but the 
results were not recognized by the West.

No free Belarus, safe Europe without free Ukraine – Tsikhanouskaya in Vilnius
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS - Lithuania's assistance to the Belarusians goes beyond words or statements expressing 
concern, Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya says.
Addressing the Lithuanian parliament on Tuesday, the Belarusian opposition leader also stressed the importance of 
the West's unity in supporting Ukraine and Belarus.
"Let me thank you on behalf of all Belarusians. We feel your support every day and we appreciate it very much, 
even if we sometimes forget to say it. Your support goes beyond formal statements, words of concern. Many 
Belarusian families fleeing repression have found temporary refuge in Lithuania," Tsikhanouskaya said.
Addressing Lithuanian lawmakers, she said she chose Lithuania as a place of refuge when she had to choose 
between prison and her children in 2020 when authoritarian Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko was 
reelected in a vote non-recognized by the West.
"Why did I choose Lithuania? Because Lithuania means security, Lithuania means friends. In a year and a half I 
have lived here, I have never once encountered a negative attitude towards the Belarusians, only support and 
solidarity," the Belarusian opposition leader pointed out.
Without a free Ukraine there will be no free Belarus, and without a free Belarus there will be no safe Ukraine and no 
safe Europe, Tsikhanouskaya stressed.
"It's very important for us for the West to remain united in supporting Ukraine and Belarus. Today, dictators are 
trying to split this unity between the US and the European Union, to drive a wedge between individual EU 
countries", the Belarusian representative said.
No free Belarus , safe Europe without free Ukraine – Tsikhanouskaya in Vilnius
She also thanked the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the country's government for its tough sanction 
policy, adding that she would continue to invite other countries to follow "Lithuania's principled example".
"Belarus is at a historic crossroads. The Belarusians understand they have only two paths: either a European and 
democratic Belarus, or de jure occupation by Russia and years of isolation, regression and lawlessness", 
Tsikhanouskaya said.
Ukraine's victory in the ongoing war started by Russia is necessary for all peoples, including the Belarusians, she 
underlined. "Only together with a free and independent Belarus and a free Ukraine will we be able to have a strong 
and secure Europe", she noted.
Tsikhanouskaya was invited to address the Seimas on Tuesday, a year after the Minsk regime forced a Ryanair 
plane with 126 passengers, en route from Athens to Vilnius, to divert to and land in Minsk where blogger Raman 
Pratasevich and his then girlfriend Sofia Sapega were detained.
Earlier this month, Sapega, a Russian citizen who studied in Vilnius, was sentenced by a Belarusian court to six 
years in prison.
On May 21, the Belarusians mark the Political Prisoner Day, and May 29 also marks two years since the arrest of 
Tsikhanouskaya's husband who was sentenced earlier this year to 18 years in prison.
Tsikhanouskaya fled to Lithuania after August, 2020 presidential election in Belarus and she continues to lead the 
Belarusian opposition from Lithuania.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's April passenger numbers up 5-fold on year
TALLINN, May 10, BNS – In April, 216,841 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport, almost five times more than 
in April last year, and the figure marked a new high of 81 percent compared to pre-crisis passenger volumes for 
April.
Eero Pargmae, member of the management board of Tallinn Airport, said in a press release that the summer flight 
plan and school holidays contributed to the company's performance in April.
"Today, the terminal is again full of people, and during peak hours the numbers of passengers and flight operations 
are already nearing the level of 2019. The number of seats offered by airlines has reached the pre-crisis level and 
the average load factor of flights rose to 65 percent in April," Pargmae said.
Pargmae noted that due to the rapid increase in passenger numbers and shortage of labor, queues may occur at 
the airport at certain times. Therefore, the state-owned airport company is asking all passengers to arrive at the 
airport at least two hours before departure.
In total, 36 scheduled destinations were available in April, plus charter flights to Egypt, Turkey and the Canary 
Islands. Speaking of new routes, Ryanair started regular flights to Nuremberg, Pegasus and SunExpress started 
regular flights to Antalya, and Aegean Airlines resumed seasonal flights to Athens.
Ryanair was the airline with the largest market share in Tallinn in April, carrying 25 percent of all passengers. 
Twenty-three percent of passengers flew with Air Baltic, followed by Finnair with a market share of 9 percent and 
Lufthansa with a market share of 8 percent.
In April, 3,153 flight operations took place at Tallinn Airport, which makes an average of 105 landings and take-offs 
a day.

The number of passengers also increased at regional airports. The airport of Kuressaare, capital of Saaremaa 
island, served more than 3,000 passengers in April, which is 62 percent more than in the same month last year. 
The number of passengers passing through the airport of Kardla, main town of Hiiumaa island, increased by 21 
percent a year ago, hitting almost 900, and 185 passengers passed through the airport of Parnu.
In total 889 passengers passed through Tartu airport, 96 percent of whom used Finnair's Helsinki-Tartu direct flight. 
Compared to last year, the number of passengers decreased somewhat at the airport of the small Gulf of Riga 
island of Ruhnu, which served 304 passengers. There are no scheduled flights to Ruhnu from May to September.

Estonian Air Navigation Services trims quarterly losses
TALLINN, May 05, BNS – The net loss of the state-owned company Estonian Air Navigation Services 
(Lennuliiklusteeninduse AS) for the first three months of this year decreased to 1.1 million euros from 3.5 million 
euros in the same period last year.
Sales revenue for the first quarter meanwhile increased by 45.4 percent year on year to 4.4 million euros. Other 
operating income grew by 8.8 percent to 171,800 euros, according to the interim report for the first quarter.
According to the management, the increase in sales revenue was due to the recovery of international passenger 
traffic. Thanks to increased volumes of passenger traffic, the amount earned by the company in navigation fees was 
bigger by 1.2 million euros or 42 percent than in the same period last year. The terminal navigation fee more than 
doubled compared with last year.
The company's operating costs increased by 8.1 percent to nearly 5.6 million euros. Labor costs increased by 6.2 
percent to 3.2 million euros. Operating profit before depreciation, or EBITDA,  totaled 321,000 euros in the three-
month period, which was 999,000 euros more than in the same period last year.
Assets of the company stood at 34.7 million euros at the end of the first quarter, decreasing by 3.5 million euros or 
9.1 percent compared to the beginning of the year. Equity totaled 17.4 million euros.
The company provided air navigation services to a total of 33,154 flights in the first three months of this year. 
Compared to the final quarter of 2021, the total number of flights served decreased by 13 percent. The number of 
overflights decreased by 4,235, while the number of inbound/departing flights decreased by 727.
The number of domestic flights increased by a modest 15 flights. The number of flights served in January-March 
2022 makes up only about 62 percent of the number of flights handled in the same period in 2019, before the 
coronavirus crisis hit.
Estonian Air Navigation Services trims quarterly losses
Of the airlines, in terms of the number of flights served by Estonian Air Navigation Services, Finnair was the number 
one with 6,868 flights, followed by Air China International with 2,427 overflights, Air Baltic with 1,964 flights, Ryanair 
with 1,450 flights and Deutsche Lufthansa with 1,365 flights.
Of the total overflight traffic, 35.7 percent was to Asia/Oceania, 38.4 percent to Finland, 21.7 percent to the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and 4.2 percent to other destinations. Of the flights to and from Tallinn, 
49.2 percent were to or from Europe, 19.7 percent to or from Finland, 10.2 percent to or from Sweden and the 
remaining 20.9 percent to or from other destinations.
The management said that in contrast to flights in the nearby region, where demand is picking up, its outlook for 
overflight traffic is rather pessimistic due to the sanctions.
"The opening of Asia-bound passenger traffic by Chinese operators is also under question. A new wave of COVID-
19 is spreading in China and very strict restrictions have been imposed again," the management added.
Estonian Air Navigation Services is a company in the area of administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and 
Communications, whose main activity is the management of local and international flights in Estonian airspace. The 
government is the sole owner of the company's shares.
Last year, the company made a loss of 3.5 million euros on revenue of 17.1 million euros.

Ryanair to expand aircraft maintenance base in Kaunas, invest EUR 15 mln (expands)
KAUNAS, Lithuania, Apr 26, BNS – Ireland's budget airline Ryanair is set to expand its aircraft maintenance base at 
Lithuania's Kaunas Airport and invest 15 million euros.
Ryanair's new hangar will double its capacity in Kaunas and will create 200 new jobs for highly skilled aviation 
engineering, mechanical and administrative professionals, the company said on Tuesday.
"We are extending our operations here in terms of maintenance facilities which will see us creating 200 additional 
jobs over the coming year or two," Dara Brady, director of marketing, digital and communications for Ryanair, told a 
press conference.
"Clearly, we've had ongoing commercial decisions over the last while that have led us to this announcement today – 
investing over 15 million in our development of our maintenance facilities is huge for the economy, huge for 
employment here in Lithuania," he said.
According to Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, LOU), FRC LT, Ryanair's Lithuanian subsidiary, is planning 
to build a two-part aircraft maintenance hangar after winning a 40-year lease of a plot of land adjacent to the 
airport's apron.
Construction on the hangar is planned to start in late 2022 and be completed within a year.
The company currently employs 270 people in Lithuania, most of them in Kaunas.
Marius Zelenius, head of communications at LOU, says that Lithuania has the ambition to further develop its aircraft 
maintenance infrastructure.

"We have the ambition. We already are the largest aircraft maintenance center in the Baltic states and I think we 
have a huge potential for growth," he told reporters.
Demand for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services is huge, as the number of air travelers is 
expected to double in the next ten to 15 years, according to Zelenius.
Elijus Civilis, general manager at Invest Lithuania, the government's foreign investment promotion agency, 
described Ryanair's decision to expand their base in Lithuania as "a good indication", saying that the country has 
proved that it is not on the periphery of the aviation industry.

Court orders Ryanair to pay EUR 600,000 to ex-employees in Lithuania
VILNIUS, Apr 14, BNS - Irish low-cost airline Ryanair must pay more than 600,000 euros to its ten former 
employees in Lithuania for unlawful dismissal, a Lithuanian court has ruled.
Kaunas District Court considered a lawsuit filed by the dismissed employees against Ryanair's subsidiaries, 
Ireland's Ryanair Designated Activity Company and Poland's Ryanair Sun.
All the plaintiffs are Lithuanian residents, Vaiva Milkeraitiene, the media and PR assistant to the Kaunas court's 
president, confirmed it to BNS.
The employees were dismissed in June, 2020 on the employer's initiative when their functions became redundant, 
the court statement reads. The claimants argued that they were unlawfully dismissed because they should have 
been transferred to the Polish company under the same conditions following the transfer of the business.
The Irish company maintained there had been no transfer of the business and that the applicants had been 
dismissed because they had committed a serious breach of the work discipline by failing to come to work after their 
transfer to Stansted Airport. The employees claimed tat they had not agreed to the transfer to London.
The court partially upheld the claim, saying that the business transfer had in fact taken place and that the workers 
had been dismissed without their fault, in breach of the Labor Code.
"As the transfer of part of the business was found to have taken place, joint solidarity liability of the defendants (the 
Irish and Polish companies - BNS) is applicable," it said.
The court also pointed out that the employees were required to live within an hour's drive from Kaunas Airport, and 
they settled or lived in Lithuania for many years, had families and young children.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport’s summer schedule offers regular services to 36 destinations
TALLINN, Apr 11, BNS – The end of March saw Tallinn Airport switch to the summer flight schedule, which brings 
with it both more frequent and more direct flights to 36 destinations in total.
Tickets to regular flights can be purchased directly from the websites of 15 airlines. There will also be a range of 
charter flights, which brings the number of destinations to a record 50 in total, the state-owned airport company said 
in press release.
Eero Pargmae, member of the company's management board, said both the airport and the airlines it serves are 
optimistic about the season ahead.
"COVID restrictions were still having a major impact on aviation last year, but the summer 2022 flight schedule is a 
sure sign that the industry is recovering, that people are itching to travel again and that airlines are looking to take 
them to interesting new destinations," he said.
Pargmae said a number of carriers have told the airport company that their Tallinn routes are more successful than 
average, which makes the company even more convinced that they will be serving a lot of passengers this summer.
Pargmae noted that a sense of security was also being restored among the people who travel.
"It’s great to see people flying again, with the old patterns starting to reassert themselves," he remarked. "Whereas 
last year people were planning things just two or three weeks in advance, we’re now seeing that that’s extended out 
to four to eight weeks on average."
Airlines are rapidly reinstating familiar routes and opening new ones ahead of the high season. For example, 
Ryanair is now giving travelers the chance to visit Nuremberg and has started flying again to Dublin; Wizz Air 
Estonia : Tallinn Airport’s summer schedule offers regular services to 36 destinations
launched flights to Venice in March and has recommenced flights to Naples, Rome and Oslo, Torp airport, and 
Aegean Airlines has begun flying once more to Athens. Meanwhile, a total of 13 routes are being offered by Air 
Baltic, including flights to the popular holiday destinations of Malaga and Nice.
Regular flights will be offered this summer to Antalya in Turkey, operated by a new airline, SunExpress. Other 
Turkish resorts will also be served by numerous charter flights, as will the Greek islands and other Mediterranean 
hotspots. Package holidays and direct flights are also available to Montenegro, Portugal, Madeira and Tunisia -- 
destinations which have not featured on the airport’s charter flight schedule every year.
Pargmae reminded passengers that regardless of the improvement in the coronavirus situation and the easing or 
lifting of restrictions in some places, they should check the requirements in their country of destination before 
setting off.
"Restrictions are tending to be lifted just about everywhere, but we strongly recommend reviewing the rules before 
travelling by using the IATA Timatic app on the airport’s website or consulting the Reisi Targalt website," he said, 
adding that passengers should also check which preventive measures their airline still has in place, since some are 
still requiring passengers to wear masks on board.
The summer flight schedule is in effect from March 27 to Oct. 29, 2022.

Riga Airport saw over seven-fold increase in passenger numbers in Q1
RIGA, Apr 5, BNS - In the first quarter of this year, 778,300 passengers were served at Riga International Airport, 
which is 7.2 times more than in the corresponding period of the previous year, according to operative data from the 
airport.
In the first quarter of 2022, the airport handled 10,900 flights, an increase of 2.6 times compared to the first three 
months of 2021, and 6,400 tons of cargo, which is 13 percent more than in the corresponding period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of passengers served in the first quarter of 2022 reached 54 percent of the pre-
pandemic period, but the number of flights served - 60 percent.

Half of all flights operated at Riga Airport in March were operated by the national airline airBaltic, followed by the 
Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair with 25.1 percent of the total number of flights.
Representatives of the airport explain that due to the geopolitical situation, the number of transit passengers at the 
airport has decreased in March. Previously, the share of transit passengers of the total number of passengers 
ranged from 15 percent to 20 percent, but in March it decreased to 10 percent of the total number of passengers.
Due to the sanctions imposed on Russia, cargo turnover handled by the airport also decreased last month - almost 
1,500 tons of cargo were handled at Riga Airport in March, and the number of cargo flights decreased by 38 
percent compared to March last year.
Laila Odiņa, the chairman of the airport's board, points out that the geopolitical situation and the sanctions imposed 
on Russia have affected the flow of transit passengers and cargo at Riga Airport, however, in general, with the start

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers up 5-fold on year in March
TALLINN, Apr 05, BNS – Altogether 172,424 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in March, which is 
approximately five times more than in March of last year, while compared to the pre-crisis period, passenger 
numbers remained at 75 percent.
Eero Pargmae, commercial director of Tallinn Airport, said that March was a very good month for the airport. "In 
March, there was an increase in both the number of scheduled flights and the average seat occupancy, which 
reached 63 percent," Pargmae said in a press release, adding that the impact of the events in Ukraine on the 
number of passengers is not yet visible.
"At the beginning of March, the number of passengers was positively affected by the school holidays, and at the 
end of March, the start of the summer flight schedule. Of course, the issue of Ukraine will be a central topic of 
discussion at all aviation meetings, but the impact of this crisis on intra-European airlines has remained more 
modest than initially expected," Pargmae said.
According to Pargmae, airlines are moderately optimistic when it comes to summer and the airport can still confirm 
that flights to European destinations are taking place along safe flight corridors.
Although the government abolished the obligation to wear a mask on April 3, Pargmae emphasized that wearing a 
mask at the airport is still recommended in situations where keeping a distance is not possible. Also, many airlines 
continue to require a mask to be worn on board the aircraft, so people should still have a mask with them at the 
airport.
In March, it was possible to take regular flights to 35 destinations, while charter flights to Egypt and the Canary 
Islands also took place. At the beginning of the month, Wizz Air opened a flight connection on the Tallinn-Venice 
route.
Estonia : Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers up 5-fold on year in March
The airline with the largest market share in March was Ryanair, which carried 27 percent of all passengers. 21 
percent of passengers flew with Air Baltic, followed by Lufthansa and Finnair with a 10 percent market share each.
There were 2,972 flight operations in March, making an average of 96 landings and take-offs a day.
Altogether 4,128 passengers passed through regional airports in March. In March, 208 passengers passed through 
Tartu airport. On March 28, after a two-year break, Finnair resumed service on the Tartu-Helsinki route.
In the summer, an increase in the number of passengers and flight operations will be seen in Parnu, when flights 
will start on the Parnu-Helsinki and Parnu-Stockholm routes. In March, 125 passengers passed through Parnu 
airport on the Ruhnu route.

Riga Airport to offer more than 100 direct destinations in summer season
RIGA, Mar 24, BNS - During the summer season of 2022 starting on March 27, along with transition to summertime, 
Riga Airport will offer connections to more than 100 direct regular and charter destinations, BNS learned from the 
airport's representative Ilze Salna.
As of March 31, a new airline – the Dutch low-cost airline Transavia Airlines C.V. – will launch its operations at Riga

connections between the Baltic States and one of the busiest transit airports in Europe.
Airlines will also offer new routes to passengers in the summer season. The national airline airBaltic will launch 
flights from Riga to Batumi in Georgia in May, while the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will add two new destinations 
to its range of destinations: Riga – Vaxjo (Sweden) from March 28 and Riga – Newcastle (United Kingdom) from 
April 1.
After a break of more than two years, airBaltic will resume flights to Malta at the end of April, while the Spanish city 
of Girona will return to the Ryanair flight schedule.
The planned total number of flights is steadily increasing as the spring approaches, and especially from next week, 
which will be the first full week of the summer season. Around 940 flights are planned at Riga Airport next week, 
which is a quarter more than this week. At the end of April, the forecast for scheduled and charter passenger flights 
already exceeds 1,000 flights per week.
As reported, Riga Airport handled 2.353 million passengers in 2021, which is an increase of 17 percent as 
compared to 2020 but a 70 percent drop from 2019.

Russian, Belarusian intelligence targeting opposition activists active in Lithuania – SSD
VILNIUS, Mar 09, BNS – Russian and Belarusian intelligence is targeting opposition activists from those countries 
active in Lithuania who are being followed, have their private discussions eavesdropped and fall victims of 
provocations, the State Security Department (SSD) said on Wednesday.
“The ruling regimes of Russia and Belarus mount pressure on non-systemic opposition organizations, which move 
their activities to foreign countries due to strong pressure and persecution from the authorities and law enforcement 
structures,” the department said in a press release.
According to SSD, Russian intelligence services, in particular Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), take active 
steps against opposition organizations and activists both within Russia’s territory and abroad.
Russia projected to step up its intelligence efforts
According to SSD, Lithuania is one of the main destinations for emigrating Russian opposition activists and is 
currently home to several hundred Russian citizens who have been granted asylum as well as persons who “do not 
apply for a special status but are engaged in political or journalistic activities”.
“Russian intelligence services are interested in information about Russian opposition activists residing in Lithuania 
and their organizations, their activities and planned actions, new projects,” the SSD said.
Lithuanian intelligence points out that Russian intelligence services may seek to infiltrate agents into the Russian 
opposition organizations active in Lithuania, to delegate intelligence officers using non-traditional cover to Lithuania, 
to use cyber tools to hack into the IT systems of opposition activists and organizations.
Russian , Belarusian intelligence targeting opposition activists active in Lithuania – SSD
“Attention paid by Russian intelligence services to the opposition activists in Lithuania is likely to increase amid the 
rise in political repression in Russia and an increase in the numbers of political emigrants from Russia.”
Belarusian intelligence activity on the rise
Belarus was rocked by more than six months of protests following the contested presidential election in August, 
2020, which the opposition and Western countries say was rigged and after which Alexander Lukashenko, in power 
since 1994, was declared winner, having secured his sixth presidential term.
Since then, Lithuania has been one of the main hubs of Belarusian political opposition activity. However, Belarusian 
intelligence services have stepped up their activity, too.
“Belarusian intelligence services participate in efforts to contain the political crisis, identify political opposition and its 
supporters, seek to intimidate those people and use the collected intelligence for discrediting those individuals, 
neighboring countries and their intelligence services as well as for propaganda campaigns,” the SSD said.
“Belarusian intelligence services go beyond the collection of intelligence and become ever more aggressive in their 
actions against the opponents of the Belarusian regime in Belarus and abroad. It is highly likely that the diversion of 
a Ryanair plane, en route from Athens to Vilnius, and its forced landing in Minsk were planned and implemented by 
Belarusian intelligence services with the aim to detain Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich who 
resided in Lithuania,” the SSD pointed out.
The SSD also said that Belarusian intelligence services cooperated with Russian intelligence services in their 
activities against political opposition.
“Intelligence and subversive activities of Belarusian intelligence services targeting Belarusian political opposition 
and the diaspora are highly likely to intensify in the near future whereas foreign countries that are home to the most 
active opposition voices will remain targets of propaganda, discrediting and disinformation campaigns,” the 
department stated.
The SSD pointed out that Western intelligence services had uncovered many special operations of Russian 
services in recent years, including attempts to assassinate opponents of the Russian regime or persons disfavored 
by that regime due to other reasons in the United Kingdom, Germany, Bulgaria and other countries.
“Operations planned and implemented by the Russian intelligence show that Russia’s political leadership and 
intelligence services see the risks related to the implementation of these operations and to a potential response as 
acceptable,” the Lithuanian intelligence said.

Preliminary turnover of LGS air traffic controller up 33.7% in 2021
RIGA, Mar 7, BNS - Latvian air traffic controller Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme (LGS) posted EUR 19.223 million in 
preliminary turnover last year, up 33.7 percent from 2020, while the company's loss dropped 2.4 times to EUR 
3.154 million, according to the information published by the company.

before the pandemic in 2019.
Revenue from aeronavigation services last year accounted for 95.2 percent of LGS turnover.
As the EU banned EU carriers to use Belarusian airspace after Belarusian authorities forces Ryanair plane to land 
in Minsk last May, the number of flights in Latvia, Lithuania and Poland increased.
Also, as the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions eased, it left a positive impact on flights.
LGS in 2020 posted EUR 14.208 million, while loss reached EUR 7.638 million.
Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme is a fully state-owned enterprise providing air navigation services to airspace users.

TALLINN, Mar 04, BNS – Altogether 127,503 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in February, which is 
approximately five times more than in February of last year, while compared to the pre-crisis period, passenger 
numbers remained at 65 percent.
Eero Pargmae, commercial director of Tallinn Airport, said that the school holidays, which started at the end of the 
month, had a positive impact on the number of passengers.
"In the airport's view, the number of passengers was very good in February, and the average seat occupancy 
increased compared to January, reaching 57 percent in February," Pargmae said in a press release, emphasizing 
that despite the tense situation in Ukraine, flying is safe and air traffic from Tallinn Airport is taking place as usual.
"We understand people's concerns about flying, but we can confirm that flights to European countries and tourist 
destinations take place on completely safe routes," he said.
In February, it was possible to take regular flights to 32 destinations. Scheduled flights were operated by 12 airlines,

Number of transit flights in Lithuanian airspace falls by half – operator
VILNIUS, Feb 28, BNS – The number of transit flights in Lithuania’s airspace has decreased by approximately 50 
percent since Sunday when Lithuania closed its airspace to Russian airlines and Russia banned flights by the 
European Union’s (EU) air carriers, Lithuania's flight management operator, Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation), said on 
Monday.
“According to our data, the number of transit flights in the Lithuanian airspace fell by approximately half over the first 
24 hours, which was also due to Russia’s counter-sanctions against the airlines of the European Union’s countries,” 
Saulius Batavicius, head of Oro Navigacija, told BNS.
“Russia’s air carriers can only look for ways to organize flights on other routes or flights over neutral waters. We 
monitor the situation continuously and consult our partners, and plans will continue to be coordinated on the 
international level,” he added.
Latvia's Air Baltic operated the largest number of flights in Lithuanian airspace last year, followed by Ireland's 
Ryanair and Russia's Aeroflot in the third place.
Moreover, the majority of aircraft transiting Lithuanian airspace headed to Russian destinations last year.
With Russia continuing military intervention in Ukraine, the European Union (EU), Canada and the United Kingdom 
announced the closure of their airspace to Russian airlines on weekend.
In response, Russia shut down its airspace to various European air carriers whereas Aeroflot on Sunday 
announced the suspension of all its flights to Europe.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport serves 132,546 passengers in January
TALLINN, Feb 07, BNS – Altogether 132,546 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in January, which is 
approximately five times more than in January of last year, while compared to the pre-crisis period, passenger 
numbers remained at 65 percent.
Eero Pargmae, commercial director of Tallinn Airport, said that the beginning of the year has always been a low 
season in terms of travel, but the results of January this year were also slightly lower than forecast.
"The extensive spread of omicron and the consequent new wave led to a drop in demand and, as a result, a 
sparser flight schedule. The seat occupancy on scheduled flights was modest in January, averaging 52 percent," 
Pargmae said.
At the same time, he said that the result for January is very good considering the current situation. "Airlines are also 
to be commended, which, despite the low demand, are not canceling flights lightly, but are still flying to their 
promised capacity and thus helping to maintain the diversity of destinations," Pargmae added.
At the same time, he noted that many European Union countries are currently moving towards easing restrictions, 
which will hopefully have a positive effect on the number of passengers and flight operations.
"We are optimistic about spring and will definitely see a rapid growth in travel in spring and summer. A snowy winter 
is great, but in the meantime we need to recharge our batteries in a warm place and the demand for package travel, 
as well as to the warmer destinations of scheduled flights, is ever increasing," Pargmae said.
In January, it was possible to take regular flights to 33 destinations. People flew the most on direct flights to major 
hubs in Helsinki, Frankfurt, Riga and Stockholm, which were used by a third of all passengers.

Scheduled flights were operated by 12 airlines, the largest of which were Air Baltic with a market share of 22

Canary Islands. A total of 2,582 flights were operated in January, making an average of 83 landings and take-offs a 
day.
Tallinn Airport served a total of 1,300,572 passengers in 2021 and aims to serve 2.5 million passengers by the end 
of 2022.

Minsk new there was no plane bomb – Lithuanian ministry on ICAO probe
VILNIUS, Feb 01, BNS – The International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO), which continues its probe into the 
diversion and forced landing of an Ryanair plane, en route from Athens to Vilnius, in Minsk, has been provided with 
additional information that proves that Belarusian services were aware there was no bomb on the plane, Lithuania's 
Transport Ministry says, citing the additional data provided by Polish law enforcement institutions to the ICAO 
Council on January 31.
"Poland has provided additional information to the ICAO investigation team and it includes the records made by a 
Minsk air controller from the air traffic control tower, proving that Belarusian services knew there was no bomb on 
the plane. This is the testimony of the same Minsk Airport officer the ICAO investigation team could not question 
during its visit to Belarus," the ministry said.
Based on this testimony and video footage, it's clear there were outsiders in the control tower in Minsk Airport, 
besides air navigation officers, and they made orders to airport staff, the ministry added.
The ICAO launched its investigation last year after the Ryanair plane with 126 passengers, en route from Athens to 
Vilnius, was diverted to and forced to land in Minsk. A fighter jet was also scrambled during this incident.
Once the plane landed in the Belarusian capital, Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapiega were detained. The detention caused international uproar.
Ryanair said Belarusian air traffic controllers told the pilots to divert the plane due to a bomb on the plane. 
Subsequent checks found no explosives.
Several countries, including the US, Canada, the UK and the EU imposed sanctions for Belarus in response to this 
incident.

Having assessed the investigation team's report, the ICAO Council concluded that the false plane bomb threat was 
caused intentionally, also paid attention to the fact the provision of false information posing threat to the safety of a 
flying plane is a violation of the Montreal Convention, and also condemned such action.
The ICAO received the incident investigation report on January 17 but later extended the probe, having received 
additional information.

Lithuania to ask to correct ICAO report on Belarus-diverted plane
VILNIUS, Jan 31, BNS – As the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) is on Monday looking into the 
report on the diversion and forced landing of an Ryanair plane, en route from Athens to Vilnius, in Minsk, Lithuania 
will ask for additional time for the correction of this document, Transport Minister Marius Skuodis says.
"From the Lithuanian side, we will ask for additional time to be provided for the report to be corrected as Poland is 
getting ready to provide additional information that has been coordinated by Polish and Lithuanian law enforcement 
agencies. It should be a basis to change the way international law is viewed in the report," Skuodis told reporters on 
Monday morning.
In his words, the information received from Poland is very important and can have impact on the incident's further 
investigation.
"It can significantly change the conclusions. From what I know, that information is significant. Since it is information 
from the investigators, I cannot comment in more detail," the minister said.
In his words, the issue of discrepancy in the facts about the bomb, recorded in the report, will be raised at the 
meeting of the ICAO Council
"Objective facts presented in the report show that the plane started descending way before the reports from 
different airports on the presence of a bomb were received. In other words, decisions were made in Belarus first 
and only afterwards the bomb threats were received," Skuodis said.
Other circumstances related to the evacuation of passengers at Minsk Airports will be considered as well.
The ICAO launched its investigation last year after the Ryanair plane with 126 passengers, en route from Athens to 
Vilnius, was diverted to and forced to land in Minsk. A fighter jet was also scrambled during this incident.

Number of flights in Lithuanian airspace up 31 pct in 2021
VILNIUS, Jan 31, BNS – The number of flights in Lithuania's airspace rose 31 percent to 164,200 last year, 
Lithuania's flight management operator, Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation), said on Monday.
The pandemic cause stagnation in the aviation sector in early 2021 but it started recovering in the second quarter 
when flight numbers started going up fast.
"As countries closed due to quarantine, the start of last year was complicated for all aviation companies. On the 
other hands, we have seen a clear increase in flight numbers since April. June stood out especially as the number 
of transit flights jumped 150 percent from 2020, and the total number of flights went up by 130 percent," Saulius 
Batavicius, head of Oro Navigacija, said in a statement.
Vilnius Airports saw its flight numbers grow 19 percent last year, and Kaunas recorded an 11 percent increase. 
Meanwhile, Palanga saw its flight number drop 19 percent, and the figures inched down more than 4 percent in 
Siauliai.
Latvia's Air Baltic operated the largest number of flights in Lithuanian airspace last year, followed by Ireland's 
Ryanair, Russia's Aeroflot, Finland's Finnair, and Germany's Lufthansa.
Ryanair and Finnair accounted for as much as 70 percent of total growth as their flights numbers rose 27 percent.

Gross violations recorded in ICAO report on Belarus-diverted plane – Landsbergis
VILNIUS, Jan 18, BNS – Gross violations are recorded in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) 
report on the diversion and forced landing of an Ryanair plane, en route from Athens to Vilnius, in Minsk, Lithuanian 
Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis says.
"I have been briefed on the report. My initial assessment is that there are clear and serious violations recorded in 
the report," he told reporters at the parliament on Tuesday. "I do understand there's a lack of who's behind those 
violations and who did that."
As the violations are recorded in the ICAO report, now one can take further legal action to hold those responsible 
accountable, Landsbergis said.
"I cannot fully comment as I have not seen the whole text, but (…) if that assessment is correct, undoubtedly, if 
unlawful action is indentified, then unlawful action should lead to consequences," the foreign minister said.
"Council representatives will formally consider any further actions to be taken by ICAO as a result of the report’s 
findings during a meeting presently scheduled for 31 January," the Montreal-bed organization said. "On that day the 
Council will also review a request from Belarus regarding what the State considers to have been unlawful 
restrictions or sanctions which were placed upon it in the aftermath of the event, by other States and the EU."
The report has been compiled by a special Fact Finding Investigation Team composed of ICAO experts in the fields 
of aviation security, aircraft operations, air navigation, and international air law.
The ICAO launched its investigation last year after the Ryanair plane with 126 passengers, en route from Athens to 
Vilnius, was diverted to and forced to land in Minsk. A fighter jet was also scrambled during this incident.

Riga Airport serves 2.35 million passengers in 2021
RIGA, Jan 10, BNS -  Operational data on Riga Airport performance show that the number of passengers handled 
at Riga Airport in 2021 exceeded 2.35 million, which is an increase of 17 percent as compared to 2020.
In comparison to 2019, the number of passengers dropped by 70 percent.
London, Tallinn, Frankfurt, Kiev and Amsterdam were the most popular destinations from Riga in 2021.
Last year, the national airline airBaltic carried the largest share or 57 percent of passengers at Riga Airport. One-
fifth or 21 percent of passengers were carried to and from Riga by the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair, which 
strengthened its presence at Riga Airport last autumn by significantly expanding the range of destinations and 
launching them with Riga-based aircraft.
Riga is still a popular transit point for travelers – in 2021, 529,400 or 22 percent of passengers used Riga Airport to 
travel to further destinations. In turn, the share of non-scheduled or charter flights at Riga Airport in 2021 accounted 
for 7 percent of all passenger traffic. For comparison, in 2019, their share was 4 percent.
“The introduction of the EU's digitally interoperable Covid-19 or the 'green' certificate last summer made it possible 
to at least partially restore epidemiologically safe travel opportunities and bring them into line across Europe. For 
Riga Airport, this meant a larger number of passengers served – since August, the Airport has served 
approximately half of the number of passengers handled in the respective month in 2019,” said Laila Odina, 
Chairperson of the Board of Riga Airport.
Last year, the air cargo segment experienced stable growth, and it is characterized by several significant events at 
Riga Airport. Cargo traffic to and through Riga Airport was not only increased by existing carriers, but thanks to the 
rapid growth of e-commerce due to the pandemic, a new air cargo connection has been established between Riga 
and Hong Kong, which is operated twice a week by the international shipping company Venipak.
Riga Airport serves 2.35 million passengers in 2021
Last year, an agreement was reached with the national airline airBaltic to establish a new cargo centre, whereas 
DHL completed the establishment of its regional hub at the Airport.
“These facts confirm that the ongoing work to develop and strengthen the Airport's cargo segment – RIX Cargo City 
– is a step in the right direction and customers appreciate the potential of Riga Airport as a regional aviation hub, 
including in the air cargo sector,” said Odina.
The total volume of air cargo handled at Riga Airport last year reached 27,900 tons, which is one-fifth more than in 
2020. The result of 2019 with 27,300 tons of air cargo handled was also exceeded by two percent. Due to the 
restrictions to limit the spread of the pandemic, the volume of cargo carried by passenger aircraft has halved, while 
the volume of cargo carried by cargo flights has increased by 70percent as compared to 2019.
The year 2021 will go down in the history of the Airport with a number of events that are less visible to the general 
public, but which are important for the Airport's work processes, infrastructure development, flight safety and the 
sustainability of the Airport's operations.
In September 2021, a new rapid exit taxi-way was opened at the aerodrome, which allows to shorten the length of 
the aircraft movement on the runway and in the taxiing area. This will reduce the fuel and time consumed during 
ground manoeuvres at the Airport, thus reducing emissions of pollutants such as CO2, hydrocarbons and 
particulate matter.
Riga Airport has also been using the A-CDM procedure as the first and currently the only airport in the Baltics since 
April, which ensures the timely exchange of accurate information between the airport operators, aircraft operators, 
groundhandlers, air traffic controllers and other parties involved from the time of flight planning until the time the 
aircraft lands on the runway. This allows for more accurate scheduling of aircraft take-off and shorter passenger 
waiting times, reducing the resource and fuel consumption costs associated with pre-departure waiting times and 
aircraft preparation for flight. It also helps reduce environmental pollution and noise. This procedure also received 
official Eurocontrol certification in the autumn.
In 2021, Riga Airport served 39,062 aircraft, which is 10 percent more than a year before; however, as compared to 
2019, this indicator dropped by 55 percent. The number of serviced passenger flights – 28,691 passenger flights – 
has decreased by 65 percent as compared to 2019, while the number of cargo flights has increased by 59 percent. 
Last year, there was also an increase in the number of serviced business aviation, technical, military and other 
types of flights. As compared to 2020, the number of these flights has increased by one tenth, but as compared to 
2019 – by almost 90 percent.
“In terms of passenger numbers, the volume of cargo and other performance indicators of the company in 2021, 
Riga Airport has shown better results than in the first year of the pandemic. We have been working with a profit for 
several months last year. However, since the pandemic continues and the global epidemiological situation is 
deteriorating at the beginning of this year due to new variants of the virus, it is very difficult to predict further 
developments. This means that the company must constantly adapt to the situation, quickly reviewing and 
organizing its daily work processes, financial and staff resources, and long-term analysis of recovery forecasts and 
the necessary development of Airport services and infrastructure,” said Odina.
Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic States.

Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers hit 1.3 mln in 2021
TALLINN, Jan 07, BNS – Tallinn Airport served a total of 1,300,572 passengers in 2021, which is 50 percent more 
than in 2020, but 60 percent less than in 2019.
Compared to pre-crisis levels, the number of passengers of regular flights recovered to the level of 37 percent on 
average and the number of charter passengers to 60 percent, Tallinn Airport said in a press release on Friday.
In December, 166,379 passengers passed through the airport, which equals 70 percent of the pre-pandemic level. 
The average load factor for scheduled flights was 56 percent in December.
Riivo Tuvike, chairman of the board of Tallinn Airport, said December was a very good month in terms of passenger 
numbers.
"While winter is traditionally a low season in terms of travel, in the last month of the year we saw  a better-than-
expected number of passengers, helped by the additions made to the flight schedule, which enabled people to fly 
directly to 34 destinations in December," the CEO said.
He said the airport company is making continued efforts to offer a varied and flexible flight schedule with a high 
quality of service. The company is delighted that passengers continue to trust them and have chosen Tallinn Airport 
as the beginning and end point of their journey.
At the end of the year, 12 airlines operated scheduled flights from Tallinn. Ryanair had the largest market share in 
December, carrying 23 percent of all passengers. A total of 36 percent of passengers used the services of low-cost 
airlines. The main destinations for direct flights were Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt and Stockholm. Eighty percent of 
charter passengers headed to Egypt and 20 percent to the Canary Islands.
Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers hit 1.3 mln in 2021
According to the CEO, the year 2021 gave the airport company courage and confidence that aviation is on the road 
to recovery.
"We are going into this year with the goal of serving 2.5 million passengers by the end of the year," he said.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus and the associated restrictions, the aviation sector saw a period of low 
demand in early 2021. Passenger numbers equaled only 14 percent of the pre-pandemic level in the first quarter 
and 22 percent in the second quarter.
The gradual recovery in passenger numbers in the second half of the year was significantly facilitated by the 
introduction of the common EU coronavirus passport, which harmonized and simplified the rules for travel. This 
helped passenger numbers to reach 50 percent of pre-crisis levels in July and 70 percent in December.
In the full-year, Air Baltic carried the largest share of passengers -- 22 percent, while the share of low-cost airlines 
was 24 percent combined. Swiss, a Swiss airline belonging to the Lufthansa group, started flying to Tallinn as a 
new airline, launching a regular service between Zurich and Tallinn in July.
A number of new routes were opened by low-cost carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air, including Rome, Naples, 
Barcelona, Billund and Liverpool. During the year, regular flights were operated to 40 destinations, on top of which 
come regular charter flights.

Airlines temporarily suspend flights from Lithuania to 20 destinations (updates)
VILNIUS, Jan 04, BNS – Airlines are temporarily suspending flights from Lithuania to 20 destinations amid the 
worldwide spread of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, with most of them expected to resume in February.
Aurimas Stikliunas, the head of aviation services at Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, LOU), told BNS that 
most of the suspended flights are to Britain, due to its strict requirements for arrivals.
"Britain and Israel, non-EU countries, apply stricter requirements, especially because of the omicron variant," 
Stikliunas said. "Airlines see that traveler flows to the countries with particularly strict requirements are low, making 
flights commercially unviable."
Many travelers opt not to travel to Britain which requires all new arrivals to take two coronavirus tests, he noted.
Stikliunas said some flights are being suspended for three weeks starting next week, with most of them planned to 
resume in late January or early February.
At Vilnius Airport, the suspended flights include Wizz Air's flights to Yerevan, Billund, Tel Aviv, Birmingham, 
Doncaster, Liverpool, Belfast and Lviv, Air Baltic's flights to Dublin, Ryanair's flights to Billund, Tel Aviv, 
Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Kharkiv, and Norwegian Air Shuttle's flights to Bergen, Stockholm and Bremen, 
according to LOU.
Ryanair is suspending flights from Kaunas to Aalborg, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Helsinki, Gothenburg and 
Stockholm.
Wizz Air and Ryanair are suspending their flights to London from Palanga Airport.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport serves 164,126 passengers in November
TALLINN, Dec 03, BNS – Altogether 164,126 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport and 2,881 flights were 
carried out in November, which is an average of 96 landings and take-offs a day.
Compared to the pre-pandemic level, demand has gradually recovered since March, reaching 68 percent of the 
usual volume in November, Tallinn Airport said. Average seat occupancy on regular flights was 58 percent in 
November.
Eero Pargmae, commercial director of Tallinn Airport, said that November was better than expected in terms of 
passenger numbers. "This winter's flight schedule surprises with its abundance of destinations and has attracted 
people to fly again and discover new places. This is also reflected in the airport's better-than-expected results. 
When visiting the terminal, it is a pleasure to see happy travelers," Pargmae said.
However, he emphasized that responsible travel continues to be important. "Due to the spread of the new virus 
strain, it is important that all arrivals from countries at risk of the omicron strain get PCR tested immediately, either 
at the airport or at another testing point. Today, at-risk countries include Turkey, Egypt and eight countries in the 
South African region. In addition, the border crossing declaration, which can be completed up to three days before 
the return flight, remains mandatory," Pargmae said.
In November, it was possible to take regular flights to 33 destinations. The airline with the largest number of 
passengers served was Ryanair, which carried 25 percent of all passengers. Air Baltic served 19 percent and Wizz 
Air 10 percent of passengers. Charter flights were operated mostly to Egypt and the Canary Islands.
Tallinn Airport is moving towards its goal to serve 1.25 million passengers by the end of 2021.

(w/ADD SECOND) EU adopts 5th package of sanctions against Belarus
(adds comment from Latvian Foreign Ministry)
BRUSSELS, Dec 2, BNS/DPA - EU ministers at a council meeting on Thursday adopted a fifth package of 
sanctions on Belarus, according to diplomatic sources.
The fifth sanctions package has been adopted in response to the hybrid attack launched by the Belarus dictator 
Alexander Lukashenko's regime against the European Union.
The sanctions immediately enter into force after their publication on Thursday evening in the the European Union's 
Official Journal, a legal register for EU regulations.
The retaliatory measures target 17 individuals and 11 entities deemed culpable in the crisis at the EU-Belarusian 
border. They are expected to include Belarusian carrier Belavia and Syrian airline Cham Wings.
The EU has banned state-owned airline Belavia from EU airspace and EU airports after Minsk forced a Ryanair 
flight to land to arrest a Belarus opposition journalist. Now, direct sanctions on the airline would prevent it from 
being able to lease aircraft from Irish, Romanian and Danish companies.
The sanctions also target Belarusian companies Belarusneft and GrodnoAzot, as well as Centrkurort travel agency.
Individuals blacklisted for sanctioning include Anatoly Lapo, head of the Belarusian Border Committee, Foreign 
Ministry Press Secretary Anatoly Glaz and Marat Markov, head of ONT TV channel.
Another package of sanctions - the sixth since the contested August 2020 Belarusian election - is also in 
preparation but will likely only be ready in January or February, one EU diplomat said.
(w/ADD SECOND) EU adopts 5th package of sanctions against Belarus
BNS was told at the Latvian Foreign Ministry that the EU and its like-minded partners demand that the Lukashenko 
regime immediately stop the migration flow to the EU, free nearly 900 political prisoners, end repressions against 
civic society, implement Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) experts' recommendations 
and take meaningful measures to address the concerts expressed as part of the OSCE Vienna mechanism.
The Minsk regime must get involved in the OSCE-sponsored dialogue with representatives of the democratic 
opposition and civic society to agree on holding a new and free presidential election under the supervision of 
international observers, the Foreign Ministry said, adding that if the regime continues its unlawful actions, Latvia will 
support increasing the sanction pressure and the adoption of a sixth package of sanctions on Belarus.
The ministry's representatives underlined that the EU and Latvia will continue to support Belarus' civic society in its 
fight for democracy and human rights. So far, Latvia's support has been aimed at providing direct assistance to the 
people who have suffered from the regime's reprisals and to Belarus' independent media and journalists.

Lithuania's Customs returns another shipment of Belaz parts to Belarus
VILNIUS, Nov 30, BNS – Lithuania's customs officers have returned another shipment of Belaz car parts back to 
Belarus.
The Customs said on Tuesday the shipment was returned because the Belaz plant is under the EU's sanctions.
The 15-ton shipment of HGV parts was meant for Bosnia and Herzegovina, valued at over 214,000 US dollars at 
Lithuania's Medininkai checkpoint.
In September, Lithuania barred another shipment from the Belarusian company from going via its port of Klaipeda. 
The shipment included 18 containers of Belaz parts that had to be delivered to Chile.
Belarusian car producer Belaz was included into the EU's 4th sanction package for Belarus in June after the Minsk 
regime forced a Ryanair lane en route from Athens to Vilnius to divert and land in Minsk for opposition activist 
Raman Pratasevich to be detained.
The EU is now considering its already fifth package of sanctions for the Minsk regime for fueling the migration crisis 
in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland.

EU close to deal on new round of Belarus sanctions - diplomats
BRUSSELS, Nov 10, BNS/REUTERS - The European Union is close to imposing more sanctions on Belarus, 
targeting some 30 individuals and entities including the foreign minister and Belarusian airline Belavia, with 
approval as early as next week, three EU diplomats said.
The new round of sanctions is set to target Belarusian officials that the EU says have organized the migrant arrivals 
in revenge for sanctions on Minsk over human rights abuses.
On Wednesday, the EU's 27 ambassadors are set to formally agree that the swelling numbers of migrants along 
Belarus' border with Poland amount to "hybrid warfare" and can serve as a legal basis for stepping up sanctions.
EU states are also considering broadening economic sanctions on Belarus imposed in July by targeting the local 
reinsurance sector and its main company state-owned BelarusRe, diplomats said.
Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei, who defended Belarus' record at the United Nations General Assembly in 
September, is one senior official set to be sanctioned because his ministry is accused of handing out Belarusian 
visas to non-EU nationals, notably Syrians and Iraqis, diplomats said.
The EU has banned state-owned airline Belavia from EU airspace and EU airports after Minsk forced a Ryanair 
flight to land to arrest a Belarus opposition journalist. Now, direct sanctions on the airline would prevent it from 
being able to lease aircraft from Irish, Romanian and Danish companies.
However, there is debate in the EU over whether the sanctions should only apply to new leases or existing 
contracts.
More sanctions this month would take the total number of people under asset freezes and travel bans in Belarus to 
almost 200 people - including Lukashenko and his sons - as well as more than a dozen institutions and companies.
EU close to deal on new round of Belarus sanctions - diplomats
As reported, several thousand migrants, mainly from Iraq and Syria, have gathered at Belarus' border with Poland 
in hopes to get into the European Union.
The Polish special services representative said that Belarus might have collected about 12,000 migrants.
EU member states trace the roots of the migrant crisis to Belarus's contested presidential election in 2020 in which 
Lukashenko claimed a sixth successive term, triggering mass street protests that were violently quelled by security 
forces.

Riga airport offers flights to more than 80 destination during winter season
RIGA, Oct 29, BNS - With the transition to winter time, the autumn/winter flight schedule will come into force at the 
Riga Airport on November 1, offering passengers 80 destinations, BNS learned from the airport.
In the new season, 13 airlines will operate flights from Riga to more than 80 scheduled and charter destinations. 
Currently, the planned total number of flights from Riga is stable and comparable to the number of flights and 
destinations in September-October, despite the fact that airlines reduce both the number of destinations and flights 
offered during the winter season and plan fewer or cancel both scheduled and charter flights to summer 
destinations.
The national airline airBaltic has planned to resume a number of winter destinations. From December 18, it will be 
possible to take a direct flight once a week to Kittila in northern Finland, which is a popular winter resort. Direct 
flights to Geneva, Salzburg and Verona will also be resumed once a week from December 18.
The largest number of new and resumed destinations from Riga this season will be offered by the Irish low-cost 
airline Ryanair, which will launch flights to 17 destinations using Riga-based aircraft. Four of the routes are new for 
Riga Airport passengers: three times a week flights to Aarhus in Denmark, two flights a week to Krakow in Poland, 
Memmingen in Germany and Palermo in Italy. The first flights to Aarhus and Krakow took place on October 28, with 
the first flight to Memmingen taking place on October 29 and to Palermo on October 30.
After a break of almost ten years, Bristol will also return to the route map of Riga Airport; Ryanair operated the last 
flight from Riga to Bristol almost ten years ago.
On December 20, the Norwegian airline Norwegian will resume flights between Riga and the third largest 
Norwegian city Trondheim twice a week. airBaltic will also continue flights to Trondheim.
International Riga airport is the largest air hub in the Baltic states.

Lithuania analyzes flight recorder of Ryanair plane forced to land in Belarus
VILNIUS, Oct 19, BNS – An analysis of a flight recorder from the Ryanair plane that was forced to land in Belarus is 
being carried out in Lithuania as part of a pre-trial investigation into the incident, Lithuania's chief prosecutor Nida 
Grunskiene said on Tuesday.
"We have the black box, and the analysis is under way. It's been sent to the United States of America," she told 
journalists at the parliament on Tuesday. "We have no suspects, and a legal assistance request has been sent to 
Belarus to provide asked data."
In her words, the pre-trial investigation involves cooperation with Polish officers."We are exchanging information," 
she said.
Lithuanian prosecutors launched the pre-trial investigation after Belarusian officers diverted the Ryanair plane en 
route from Athens to Vilnius on May 23 and forced it to land in Minsk where Belarusian opposition blogger Raman 
Pratasevich and his Russian citizen girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a student of the Vilnius-based European Humanities 
University ,were detained.
Additional sanctions were later imposed for the Minsk regime because of this incident.

Number of flights in Lithuanian airspace soars 1.7 times in September y/y
VILNIUS, Oct 12, BNS – The number of flights in Lithuania's airspace increased 1.7 times in September year-on-
year to 17,500, Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation) said on Tuesday.

Lithuania expects further action after ICAO report on Ryanair flight's diversion to Minsk
VILNIUS, Oct 11, BNS – Lithuanian Transport Minister Marius Skuodis expects the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) to take further action after the findings of its investigation into last May's forced landing of 
Ryanair's Athens-Vilnius flight in Minsk are published in November.
During his visit to Montreal, Skuodis met with ICAO Council President Salvatore Sciacchitano and members of the 
Council, and other representatives of the organization, the Transport Ministry said in a press release on Monday.
"This year, we have repeatedly faced incidents of civil aviation being used for illegal or unprecedented objectives," it 
quoted the minister as saying at the meetings.
"First of all, we are attaching great importance to the ICAO investigation into the forced landing of a Ryanair plane 
in Minsk. We expect timely submission of a final report of the organization’s investigators in November," he said.
"The actions taken by the organization once the findings of the investigation are disclosed are also extremely 
important".
Skuodis "reiterated full national support and involvement" in the investigation.
There are other worrying signs that international civil aviation is often used as a means of organizing illegal 
immigration, the minister said, referring specifically to illegal migration across the Lithuanian-Belarusian border, 
which has also expanded to the neighboring countries of Latvia and Poland.
"There are suspicions of such migration being organized by using the airlines of other countries," he said.
Lithuania expects further action after ICAO report on Ryanair flight's diversion to Minsk
On May 23, Belarus' air traffic controllers instructed Ryanair's pilots to land the aircraft with 126 passengers in 
Minsk because of "a potential security threat on board". A fighter jet was scrambled in the incident.
Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian blogger, and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were detained after the flight landed in 
Minsk.  A check of the plane did not reveal any explosives.
In the wake of the diversion, Lithuania asked the ICAO Council for a thorough and objective investigation of the 
incident under the Chicago Convention.
The ICAO's fact-finding investigation team in charge of the international investigation "visited countries related to 
the incident and gathered information, data and facts to reconstruct the sequence of events of this incident", 
according to the ministry's press release.
In August, the team met with Lithuanian, Polish and Belarusian officials.
"The ICAO FFIT investigators are analyzing the material provided by all institutions and countries and are planning 
to concentrate on inconsistencies detected in the declarations of the countries while providing facts of the incident 
and the sequence of events," it said.
Belarus' actions drew condemnation from many Western countries and international organizations.
In response to the forced landing of the Ryanair flight, the EU banned Belarusian carriers from its airspace and 
airports and later adopted sectoral sanctions against Minsk.
The Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office has launched a pre-trial investigation into the incident. The hijacking of 
the Ryanair aircraft is also being investigated by law enforcement bodies in Poland, where the plane was 
registered.

EU to tighten visa rules for Belarusian officials
BRUSSELS, Sep 29, BNS/REUTERS - The European Union will tighten visa rules for Belarusian state officials in 
response to Minsk's aggressive attempts to destabilize the bloc by weaponizing migration.
“We have an aggressive regime, Lukashenko, that is actually pushing migrants ... to the European border to 
destabilize the European Union,” EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told journalists Wednesday. 
“This is an act of aggression.”
Europe’s migration commissioner made the comments as part of an update on stalled efforts to agree a new EU 
migration system to replace the one that failed amid a 2015-16 spike in Mediterranean immigration.
Stressing that data from EU law enforcement agency Europol shows 90 percent of those arriving irregularly in the 
bloc have used people smugglers along the way, she proposed to EU states that they step up their fight against 
such traffickers.
For Belarus, she said tightening visa procedures for state officials - but not ordinary Belarusians - was needed.
"What we are seeing now is a desperate Lukashenko," the EU commissioner said said. "This is a regime that has 
denied its own people free and fair elections. This is a regime that is putting political opposition in jail."
"This is a regime that has hijacked a passenger flight... and now is... using innocent people in an act of aggression. 
This is not a regime we should cooperate with," Johansson said.
The EU and Belarus enacted a new visa facilitation deal in July last year to ease procedures and reduce costs for 
Belarusians willing to visit the bloc briefly.
EU to tighten visa rules for Belarusian officials
But Minsk has since withdrawn from its linked EU readmission agreement, which establishes cooperation on 
sending away people who stay in the bloc without the formal right to do so.
That came as the EU sanctioned Belarus over a disputed election last August and a crackdown on protests after 
Lukashenko claimed victory and extended his 26-year-long rule.
The bloc then stepped up sanctions, introducing broader economic curbs on Minsk after Belarus forced a Ryanair 
flight to land on its soil last May to arrest a dissident on board.
Migrants from Iraq, Kurdistan, Congo and Cameroon then started appearing on the Belarus border with Lithuania, 
which had no such immigration in the past, and then on its frontiers with Latvia and Poland.
The EU accuses President Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating a sharp rise in migrant arrivals across the 
Belarus border with bloc members Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. The increase happened after the 27-nation union 
slapped sanctions on Minsk over human rights abuses and an election widely deemed rigged.
Lukashenko has blamed the West here for what he said was a looming humanitarian catastrophe this winter at the 
Belarusian-Polish border.

European Commission transport chief: Nordica should also fly from Estonia
TALLINN, Sep 20, BNS - With the Estonian state owning an air carrier, it is elementary that it should operate routes 
from Estonia to various destinations, Henrik Hololei, director-general of the European Commission's Directorate-
General for Transport and Mobility, said, according to the online news portal of public broadcaster ERR.
"How the aviation company belonging to the Estonian state is to continue its operation is a question to its owner. 
With the Estonian state owning an air carrier, it is elementary that it should operate routes from Estonia to various 
destinations. At present, it does not do that. It currently carries out subcontracts, and does so successfully, which 
helps keep the company afloat. Whether or not this will also be the future of the air carrier owned by the state is a 
question for its owners," Hololei said on ETV's morning program "Terevisioon".
Hololei noted that the framework for temporary state aid in aviation will last until the end of the year, after which a 
pre-pandemic normal situation will return.
"Granting state aid in aviation is permitted on market conditions once per 10 years. During the pandemic, the 
opportunities have been different compared with a normal situation. Thus, various air carriers have received 
injections of state aid during the pandemic which they would not ordinarily receive. The extraordinary situation will 
last until the end of this year and then we will return to normality. The current cash injections also must be lawful, 
however, and we are checking them," he said.
The state aid granted during the pandemic has greatly helped many air carriers, which Hololei deems reasonable 
as the pandemic has been particularly difficult for the tourism and transport sector.
"On the other hand, there are aviation companies that have not received even one cent of aid and who are 
performing the most flights today. Ryanair is the best example. They currently have 87 percent of the flights they 
had before the pandemic. Meanwhile, the air carriers that have received large sums of aid, have around 50 
percent," he said.
European Commission transport chief: Nordica should also fly from Estonia
Hololei explained that if a company is flexible and able to quickly adapt to various market conditions, it can also 
survive situations that are as difficult as the coronavirus pandemic.
"We need that the common aviation area be preserved in Europe. It has rendered aviation accessible and 
affordable. For that, we need air carriers. However, competition is what takes us forward, and not some 
administrative techniques. And this competition must be preserved in all situations," he added.
States closing their borders was one of the biggest mistake during the coronavirus pandemic, as a result of which, 
people lost their desire to travel.
"One did not know where they would end up or what the requirements were. Whether or not self-isolation would be 
needed or what documents are required. All of this was a major setback. And it took a year and a half to recover 
from it," Hololei said.
The COVID-19 certificate introduced from July 1 has helped restore European aviation to a significant degree, 
according to Hololei.
"Such steps should have been taken much, much earlier. However, this pandemic was unexpected for all of us and 
at first we didn't know how to react. The most important lesson to be learned from this is that a situation where 
everything is closed must be prevented. A situation where people are in the dark and any and all connectivity has 
been terminated. This should never happen again," he said.

Number of flights in Lithuanian airspace soars 50 pct in August y/y
VILNIUS, Sep 10, BNS – The number of flights in Lithuania's airspace surged by around 50 percent in August year-
on-year, Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation) said on Friday.
Saulius Batavicius, director of the state-owned air navigation service provider, said the growing flight traffic had 
helped the company to return to profit in July and August.
"These were the first months since the end of 2019 when the company was no longer loss-making and made a 
profit," he said in a press release.
Batavicius expects Oro Navigacija to post a profit for September, too, recording its first quarter in the black in a year 
and a half.
In August, the number of overflights across Lithuania increased by 70 percent to 14,300, with most of them being to 
Russia (5,267), Germany (1,316)) and Latvia (994).
Latvia's Air Baltic operated the largest number of flights in Lithuanian airspace (1,627), followed Ireland's Ryanair 
(1,333), Russia's Aeroflot (1,057) and Finnair (962).

Riga Airport plans to hire more than 200 employees by end-2021
RIGA, Sep 7, BNS - As the situation in the aviation industry continues to stabilize, Riga International Airport is 
planning to hire more than 200 employees by the end of the year, as the airport's representatives told BNS.
Riga Airport's CEO Laila Odina said that the number of passengers served at the airport this past August was 
almost half of the monthly passenger turnover before the crisis, while the number of flights planned by airlines in the 
winter season was approaching the 2019 level.
"We will also need employees to implement the company's development plans. The airport continues work on both 
the new passenger terminal project and the development of the cargo service center RIX Cargo City," said Odina.
Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will open a base in Riga this coming fall, expanding its flight network, and from January 
the airport will start providing ground handling servicess for the national airline airBaltic.
"Even if, due to Covid-19, the number of flights in the fall and winter is lower than we are currently planning, the 
airport will need additional staff," said Odina.
Riga Airport is inviting both former and new employees to apply for vacancies at the airport.
The company currently has about 40 different vacancies, and an even larger number of vacancies will be 
announced in the near future.
The airport will hold an open house for potential employees on September 16.
Currently, Riga Airport has more than 1,000 employees in 14 different departments.

Belarusian services conducting Operation Floodgate against Latvia, Lithuania and Poland - journalist
WARSAW, Aug 26, BNS/POLSKIERADIO - A recent influx of Asian migrants trying to enter Poland from Belarus 
bears all the hallmarks of a deliberate political act by strongman Alexander Lukashenko's regime, a London-based 
journalist has claimed.
In an article filled with photographic, video and documentary evidence, Tadeusz Giczan writes that Belarus has 
orchestrated the arrival of thousands of people from countries such as Iraq, Polish Radio reports.
They are then helped to illegally enter the European Union, originally through Lithuania, and now mainly via Poland 
and Latvia.
This is all part of the state-backed Operation Floodgate, a plan conceived a decade ago by the Belarusian security 
service, with the aid of Russia's FSB, according to the Minsk-born, Poland-educated journalist.
He published the article on his own website, waidelotte.org, on Tuesday.
Giczan observed that in late May, when Belarus hijacked a Ryanair flight to detain opposition activist Roman 
Protasevich, Lukashenko issued a warning to the EU.
"We've been stopping drugs and migrants; now you will be catching them yourselves," the Belarusian strongman 
said at the time, according to Giczan.
By then the state-owned Belarusian company Centrkurort had begun to work with Iraqi travel agencies, arranging 
ever more flights, with ever more people, from the Middle East, Giczan said.
Belarusian services conducting Operation Floodgate against Latvia , Lithuania and Poland - journalist
Upon paying USD 600-1,000 per person for a one-week stay in Belarus, Iraqi nationals were granted tourist visas. 
But some of them immediately headed for the EU border, according to the journalist, who works for the Center for 
European Policy Analysis (CEPA).
Moreover, Giczan asserted in his article that there was clear evidence, including from the EU's border management 
agency Frontex, that Belarus officials were turning a blind eye as immigrants attempted to cross into the EU.
In many cases Minsk's border guards escorted them to the border themselves. They even removed barbed wire 
fences to smooth out the way, Giczan reported.
Photographs also show that migrants were transported to the border by buses from the Belarusian ministry of 
defense, according to the waidelotte.org website.
Throughout June and July, all went to Lukashenko's plan, as Iraqis were joined by growing numbers of Africans, 
chiefly from the Congo and Cameroon.
Minsk's state-owned media warned Warsaw and Vilnius they would soon have to deal with a large-scale 
contraband of heroin, too, according to Giczan.
But then, in early August, Lithuania said it would start to turn migrants away, while Brussels pressed Iraq into 
suspending all flight connections with Belarus.
And so thousands of immigrants who had been assisted with a view to entering Lithuania became stranded. They 
are now being directed to Poland and Latvia as a plan B, the article posted at waidelotte.org said.
What's more, Lukashenko has announced he will be bringing in ever more migrants and refugees, including from 
Afghanistan, Giczan claimed.
Meanwhile, migrants from Iraq have begun flying in through Istanbul, along with large groups of people from across 
the Middle East and Africa, according to Giczan.
In conclusion of his report, Giczan said Operation Floodgate would likely continue for as long as the Polish and 
Latvian borders remained permeable.
"Judging from what is currently happening in Poland, it cannot be ruled out that the next attack ... will be directed 
specifically at Poland," the journalist warned.

Aftenposten: Large part of population of Estonia, Latvia living in Russian world
TALLINN, Aug 21, BNS – Russian-speaking people in Estonia and Latvia live in the Russian world, writer and social 
anthropologist Erika Fatland writes in Norway's largest daily Aftenposten.
In an article entitled "Trapped in the Kremlin's long shadows" ("Fanget i Kremls lange skygger"), Fatland says that 
thirty years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin still casts a long shadow over the former Soviet 
republics.
"On August 19, 1991, the Soviet conservative top elite tried to overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. The coup 
attempt failed, but it became the last nail in the coffin of an already shaky empire. Four months later, the Soviet 
Union officially collapsed," Fatland says.
Although 30 years -- a whole generation -- have passed since the collapse of the union, Moscow has not given up 
on seeing lost republics as its legitimate backyard, Fatland writes, explaining the situation to Norwegian readers 
and looking more closely at Georgia and Ukraine, where the Russian Federation has recently used force.
"No one dared to help the Georgians in the 2008 war with Russia. No one -- except Russia -- intervened militarily in 
the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. If the Kremlin decided to take a piece of Kazakhstan, no one would come to 
the aid of the Kazakhs," Fatland writes. "The Baltic states, on the other hand, are in a different situation. In 2004, 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania became members of both the European Union and NATO. Russia's attack on the 
Baltics is therefore very unlikely."
"When the Russians come, I will go in the forest to fight," Fatland quotes a determined young Latvian woman. "The 
weapon is ready to fire. And I am ready to sacrifice my life for the freedom of Latvia."
Aftenposten: Large part of population of Estonia , Latvia living in Russian world
However, according to Fatland, the people are still scared. They live in the shadow of their big brother to the East 
and hear swords -- this time in the form of large military exercises -- rattle on the other side of the border.
Moreover, a large part of the population of Estonia and Latvia is made up of Russians, who are part of the Russian 
world, which Putin has promised to protect. Moscow still treats the lost republics like disobedient runaway children, 
Fatland writes.
In the worst situation are those neighboring countries that do not have big friends or a military alliance behind them. 
Unfortunately, they make up the majority and are completely alone, she adds.
Regarding Belarus, however, Fatland writes that EU sanctions following the national hijacking of a Ryanair aircraft 
have moved Belarus even closer to its giant eastern neighbor, which has long been waiting with open arms.

EU could step up sanctions for Belarus – EP president in Vilnius
VILNIUS, Aug 18, BNS – The European Union's existing sanctions for Belarus are effective but those can be further 
stepped up, European Parliament President David Sassoli says.
"We don’t want to go back in terms of sanctions. We believe that it's an effective way. We spoke with the prime 
minister (Ingrida Simonyte – BNS) and said that they might be stepped up. (…) Every time we touch the wallet, 
there's a reaction, therefore, we see it might be a positive thing," Sassoli told a joint press conference with the 
Lithuanian prime minister in Vilnius on Wednesday.
"We will definitely not renounce the sanctions. What we are demanding is the release of political prisoners, not to 
hear about such aggressive facts like about the Ryanair plane, the kidnap of the young man, Raman (Pratasevich), 
who is being kept under house arrest, but he was humiliated in the eyes of his community (…). It's humiliation and 
we want it to be compensated," the EP president said.
Sassoli also said he was baffled by Russia's April decision to introduce sanction for him and several other 
European officials, banning them from entering the country. He views that as a response to the EU's principled 
position on subjecting Russia to sanctions.
The European Union imposed sectoral sanctions for Belarus, including its trade in potassium fertilizers, in late June. 
Earlier sanctions applied to Belarusian officials linked to a crackdown on and repressions against peaceful 
demonstrators.
In early August, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called on the EU to impose new sanctions for 
Belarus and not to recognize decisions by authoritarian Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko.

MEP Paet: Tallinn Airport rushed to remove photo exhibition on Belarus women
TALLINN, Aug 13, BNS – Member of the European Parliament Urmas Paet on Friday leveled harsh criticism at 
Tallinn Airport for what he described as hasty removal of a photo exhibition about Belarusian women putting up 
resistance to the dictatorship of Alexander Lukashenko.
"I am very unpleasantly surprised by the decision of Tallinn Airport, which belongs to the Estonian state, to take 
down, in an expedited manner, the photo exhibition on Belarusian women opposing Lukashenko's dictatorship," 
Paet told BNS on Friday.
"The Future of Belarus Fueled by Women" is a "Fotografiska for Life" special exhibition that was created in 
cooperation with the Belarusian platform SHKLO, which unites photographers and visual artists in the country, and 
forms part of global actions drawing attention to events in Belarus.
The Fotografiska center of photographic art had a permanent contract with Tallinn Airport on displaying exhibitions 
in the airport's gallery. Several Fotografiska exhibitions have been on display there previously.
The exhibition on Belarusian women was put up on display on June 30 and was due to be up until the end of the 
year. However, it was taken down already on Aug. 9 at the will of Tallinn Airport, which is owned by the Estonian 
state, Paet said.
"Such behavior is unacceptable. Especially in a situation where the struggle of the Belarusian people against the 
dictatorship continues. And where Lithuania, Latvia and Poland are now under direct attack from the Belarusian 
dictatorship, in addition to their own people," the MEP said.
He said that following the recent forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk and the arrest of two opposition figures, 
many European airports expressed solidarity with the detained persons and demanded their release.
MEP Paet: Tallinn Airport rushed to remove photo exhibition on Belarus women
"I have seen photos and statements of support for the people opposing the dictatorship in Belarus at several 
airports," Paet said.
The MEP said that also the owner of Tallinn Airport, the state of Estonia, has repeatedly expressed support for the 
anti-dictatorship forces of Belarus and has joined the measures of the European Union against the Lukashenko 
regime. Estonia is also providing assistance to Lithuania in the hybrid war waged by the Lukashenko regime.
The European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Belarusian women who are 
fighting against dictatorship.
"And against this background, Tallinn Airport, which is owned by the Estonian state, finds that the exhibition 
introducing and supporting Belarusian women who are opposed to dictatorship is no longer suitable for the airport's 
gallery. I do not know from where and from whom such an order, for the exhibition to be taken down in an expedited 
manner, came, but it is incomprehensible and wrong," Paet said.
"It is shocking that the hybrid war against the Baltic states and Poland, initiated by the Lukashenko regime, has 
already been successful in Estonia in such form," he added.
Paet said that the least that Tallinn Airport's managers and the Estonian state, as the owner of the airport, can do is 
to quickly reinstall the exhibition.
"Then maybe there will be a little less shame," he added. "The Estonian state must have the backbone to stand up 
to a dictator and his wishes."
BNS is awaiting a comment from Tallinn Airport.

Lithuanian formin wants new sanctions for Minsk, non-recognition of Lukashenko's decisions
VILNIUS, Aug 09, BNS – Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis has on Monday called on the 
European Union to impose new sanctions for Belarus and not to recognize decision of the country's authoritarian 
President Alexander Lukashenko as one year since his re-election is marked.
"In spite of Lithuania's existing focus on the resolution of the migrant crisis, which is also linked to the Belarusian 
regime, we believe that pressure on the Belarusian regime should not be eased," Landsbergis told a joint press 
conference with Vilnius-based Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.
"Discussions are ongoing regarding both additional sanctions that should be specifically linked to the migrant crisis, 
and also sanctions that should be imposed to put pressure on the regime," he added.
The international community should not recognize Lukashenko's international treaties, for example, agreements 
with Russian on their commonwealth, as well as amendments to the Belarusian Constitutions adopted during 
Lukashenko's rule.
"An illegitimate president cannot enter into legitimate treaties or ensure legitimate constitutional amendments," 
Landsbergis said.
Lithuania and other Western countries consider the presidential election in Belarus on August 9, 2020, when 
Lukashenko was re-elected for a new term, to have been rigged and they do not recognize it.
Tsikhanouskaya, who maintains she won the presidential election, was forced to flee Belarus and now lives in 
Lithuania. She told the joint press conference that the international community should remain consistent and 
promote a values-based foreign policy.
Lithuanian formin wants new sanctions for Minsk, non-recognition of Lukashenko's decisions
The opposition leader believes Western countries should support Lithuania and other countries neighboring 
Belarus.
"I see Belarus is now in the process of revolution, but our neighbors are also suffering because of this," she said. 
"We have to be consistent on the ground and democratic countries should be consistent in their foreign policy."
Mass demonstrations in Belarus followed the re-election of Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994. Force 
and representations against peaceful protesters followed and trials of protesters are still taking place in Belarus, 
with around 600 people deeded political prisoners.
The EU imposed several post-election packages of sanctions for Belarus. The latest economic restrictions were 
imposed in response to the diversion and force landing in Minsk by the Belarusian regime of a Ryanair plane, en 
route from Athens to Vilnius, to detain Belarusian opposition bloger Raman Pratasevich and his Russian citizen 
girlfriend.
Reminiscing of these events, Tsikhanouskaya said: "In one year, the regime has gone from legitimate to terroristic".
She also thanked Lithuania for principles and "dedication to our common democratic values", despite the fact that 
Lithuania's support of Belarusian civil society led to the ongoing migrant crisis.
Landsbergis said he would not change anything that has happened over the past year while helping the people of 
Belarus.
"I am glad that Lithuania then stood up for people who love freedom, who want democracy, who want recognition 
that their dignity is important," the minister said.

Number of flights in Lithuanian airspace jumps 1.8 times in July – operator
VILNIUS, Aug 09, BNS – The number of flights in Lithuania's airspace jumped by 1.8 times in July year-on-year to 
17,600, Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation), the state-owned air navigation service provider, reported on Monday, citing 
growing numbers of vaccinated people and the vacation season behind the increase.
Saulius Batavicius, head of ON, says the situation in the aviation sector look rosy.
"This year, compared to last year, when we had a drop of more than 60 percent in the number of flights, we see that 
we lack 30-40 percent to reach the successful year of 2010. in the Baltic context, Lithuania is leading considerably," 
he was quoted as saying in a statement.
In July, the number of overflights across Lithuania doubled to 13,600, with most of them going to Russia (5,140), 
Germany (1,369) and Latvia (883).
From Lithuania, most flights headed the UK (207), Germany (189) and Latvia (152).
Last month, Latvia's airBaltic operated the largest number of flights in the Lithuanian airspace (1,396), followed by 
Ryanair (1,227), Aeroflot (1,053) and Finnair (741).

Latvian police start criminal procedure over interception of Ryanair aircraft in Minsk
RIGA, Jul 30, BNS - Latvian law enforcement authorities have started a criminal procedure over the interception of 
Ryanair aircraft in Minsk in May this year, State Police spokeswoman Simona Gravite informed BNS.
At the end of May, the State Police opened an in-house probe into the incident but later it was decided to launch a 
criminal investigation.
The criminal procedure has been started based on the chapter of the Criminal Law about criminal offences against 
personal liberty, honor and dignity. Illegal deprivation of liberty, kidnapping and seizure of hostages warrant criminal 
liability under the provisions of this chapter.
Police would not comment whether the investigation also involves international cooperating.
The initial probe was started because there were two Latvian nationals on the plane.
As reported, the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office launched a pre-trial investigation in the incident. The 
Lithuanian authorities interrogated some of the airplane passengers after the plane landed at Vilnius airport.
As reported, on 23 May, the Belarusian authorities ordered a fighter jet to force a Ryanair civilian flight FR 4978 to 
perform an emergency landing at Minsk National Airport so that an independent journalist and opposition activist 
from Belarus, Raman Pratasevich, could be detained.

Lithuanian formin calls sanctions for Belarus over illegal migrants "fairest response"
VILNIUS, Jul 12, BNS –Additional sanctions for Belarus for fueling the migration crisis would be the EU's fairest 
response, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said in Brussels on Monday ahead of a meeting of 
EU foreign ministers.
"We have to send a very clear signal to Lukashenko now and also other dictators that such measures used against 
states will receive response. We urgently need to speak about further sanctions. (…) Sanctions should be very 
clear, swift and, in my opinion, it's the fairest response," Landsbergis said.
In his words, Belarus is waging a hybrid attack on the EU, using illegal migrants "as leverage to force the EU to 
change its position on sanctions, on human rights, on defending the opposition, making it to change its mind".
Lithuania is proposing to the EU to impose new sanctions for Belarus soon after the EU agreed on sectoral 
sanctions for this country after Minsk forced a Ryanair passenger place en route from Athens to Vilnius to divert and 
land in Minsk so that opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega could be detained.
The EU also imposed various other sanctions for Belarus in response to the Lukashenko regime's crackdown on 
the country's opposition following last year's contested presidential election.
As relations with Belarus continue to soar, Lithuania has recently seen a spike in illegal migrants crossing in from 
Belarus.
Speaking about the return of illegal migrants to their countries of origin, Landsbergis said the EU's joint response 
and a common return policy would be "much more effective" and would help Lithuania to cope with the existing 
problems faster.

Landsbergis also thanked the countries that have already provided assistance, and also asked other EU member 
states to join the effort to deal with the crisis.
A total of 1,676 foreigners have been detained near Lithuania's border with Belarus so far this year, up more than 
20 times from last year. Minsk says it's not stopping migrants in its territory because of the existing EU sanctions.

Lithuanian formin to present proposal to EU ministers on new sanctions for Belarus
VILNIUS, Jul 12, BNS – Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis and his counterparts from other EU 
member states will on Monday in Brussels discuss his proposal to impose new sanctions for Belarus.
Landsbergis' proposal comes in response to Minsk's role in the recent migration crisis in Lithuania.
The minister told BNS on the eve of the meting that the EU should deter authoritarian regimes from using people as 
tools for the whole Community's political blackmailing.
On Sunday, Landsbergis discussed his proposal during an informal meeting with the Nordic and Baltic foreign 
ministers.
Lithuania is proposing to the EU to impose new sanctions for Belarus soon after the EU agreed on sectoral 
sanctions for this country after Minsk forced a Ryanair passenger place en route from Athens to Vilnius to divert and 
land in Minsk so that opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega could be detained.

As relations with Belarus continue to soar, Lithuania has recently seen a spike in illegal migrants crossing in from 
Belarus.
The European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs and on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are also 
holding an extraordinary meeting on Monday to discuss the influx of migrants. The meeting will be attended by 
European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson, Fabrice Leggeri, executive director of Frontex, 
Lithuanian Interior Minister Agne Biloraite, and Luc Devigne from the European External Action Service (EEAS).
Lithuanian formin to present proposal to EU ministers on new sanctions for Belarus
"That's a hybrid attack by Lukashenko, assisted by the Kremlin, not only against Lithuania but also against the 
whole of the EU. Like mines or bombs, people from far countries are thrown over the border for attacks against the 
sovereignty of the neighboring country. Swift and adequate steps from the EU are needs as it's not a manifestation 
of natural migration," Lithuanian MEP Rasa Jukneviciene, who initiated the discussion of this issue at the EP, said 
in a statement.
Minsk says it's not stopping migrants in its territory because of the existing EU sanctions.

Air Baltic does not have to pay EUR 16 mln to flyLAL – Lithuanian court (expands)
VILNIUS, Jun 28, BNS – flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines (flyLAL) will not recover more than 16 million euros in damages 
from Latvian air carrier Air Baltic, which the bankrupt Lithuanian air company accused of breaching competition and 
forcing it out of the market.
On June 28, the Court of Appeal of Lithuania repeatedly annulled the January 2016 ruling issued by Vilnius 
Regional Court that awarded FlyLAL 16.121 million euros in damages from Air Baltic.
“The court concluded that there had been no prohibited agreement as the respondents [Air Baltic and Riga Airport] 
had complied with the mandatory obligations set forth in Latvia’s legislation. Hence the court dismissed flyLAL’s 
arguments that Air Baltic had used a predatory pricing strategy, sought to distort competition, squeeze competitors 
out of the market or create barriers to market entry”, the court said in a press release.
The appeal court first annulled the ruling of Vilnius Regional Court in March 2020. However, the Supreme Court of 
Lithuania in February referred the case back to the Court of Appeal for retrial stating that the appeal court had failed 
to duly define the grounds of the lawsuit and determine all relevant factors to identify a potential infringement of the 
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Following the retrial, the Court of Appeal stated that the disputed system of discounts had been established in 
accordance with Latvia’s legislation, which had been imperative and applicable throughout the period of the dispute, 
during which the decision of Latvia’s competition authority, which was adopted in 2006 and said that the discounts 
of Riga Airport distorted the market and benefitted Air Baltic and Ireland’s Ryanair, had no legally binding effect.
Air Baltic does not have to pay EUR 16 mln to flyLAL – Lithuanian court (expands)
“Due to this reason, Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union cannot be applied to Riga 
International Airport and Air Baltic … and precludes an action for damages filed against these entities,” the court 
said.
In addition, the appeal court stated that, despite the established dominance of Air Baltic in respective markets, its 
abuse of dominance had not been proved.
The decision of the appeal court can be challenged in the Supreme Court of Lithuania within a period of three 
months.
The dispute between flyLAL and Air Baltic Corporation and Riga Airport was triggered more than a decade ago by 
an alleged violation of the competition law and damage. flyLAL asked for the compensation of damage caused by 
Air Baltic and Riga Airport's alleged illicit discount agreement at Riga Airport. flyLAL also claimed it had been 
pushed out of the flight market due to Air Baltic's predatory pricing at Vilnius Airport.
After seven years of litigation, Vilnius Regional Court ruled in January 2016 that Air Baltic had to pay 16.121 million 
euros in damages to flyLAL. Riga Airport, which offered discounts to Air Baltic, then avoided responsibility. As 
flyLAL's claims against Riga Airport were heard during closed-door court sittings, it was not disclosed why Riga 
Airport was not obliged to pay any compensation to the Lithuanian company.
The Latvian companies disputed experts' conclusions that the damage sustained by flyLAL due to Riga Airport's 
discounts to Air Baltic in 2004-2008 stood at 43.4 million euros. flyLAL was of an opinion that the Latvian 
companies must pay it 57.87 million euros in damages.
In 2014, the EU Court of Justice allowed sequestrating the assets of Riga Airport and Air Baltic and in July 2018, it 
ruled that the dispute could be heard by both Lithuanian and Latvian courts.

Rinkevics calls on international community to protect media and journalists in Belarus
RIGA, Jun 24, BNS - Today, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity), took part in a side event on 
the media situation in Belarus co-sponsored by several United Nations member states, including Latvia, during the 
47th session of the UN Human Rights Council, BNS was informed by the Foreign Ministry.
In his remarks, the Minister reminded the audience that the UN Member States have a shared responsibility to 
stand up for the rights of media and journalists in Belarus. Rinkevics noted that at this point focus must be placed 
on very practical support for Belarusian journalists and members of the media inside and outside the country. The 
Foreign Minister confirmed that Latvia has already been providing support to Belarusian independent journalists 
and people working with the media and news organizations through rehabilitation services and psychological 
counselling.
The Latvian Foreign Minister underlined that the hijacking of a Ryanair flight and forcing it to land in Minsk on May 
23 is a blatant attack by Lukashenko’s regime on the media and freedom of expression. Rinkevics repeated the call 
on Belarusian authorities to immediately release Raman Pratasevich and other journalists and political prisoners.
The Minister noted that it is important to continue to urge the Belarusian authorities to implement recommendations 
of the OSCE Moscow Mechanism. Rinkevics stressed that, as a UN member state, Belarus has an obligation to 
respect fulfil its international obligations and commitments and protect the rights of its own citizens.

EU ambassadors agree on economic sanctions on Belarus – sources (expands)
VILNIUS, Jun 23, BNS –  EU member states' ambassadors agreed on Wednesday on economic sanctions on 
Belarus' individual sectors, sources familiar with the situation told BNS.
Among other things, the sanctions will ban the transit of some Belarusian fertilizers through the Lithuanian seaport 
of Klaipeda.
It remains to be seen what impact the restrictions will have on Lithuanian companies involved in transit shipments, 
because it is not yet clear what specific fertilizer products will be targeted.
The new package should be finally approved on Thursday after the completion of the written procedure. EU leaders 
are also expected to back the sanctions at their meeting on Thursday.
The port of Klaipeda and the state railway company Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai (Lithuanian Railways) will be affected by 
the sanctions which will target, among others, Belaruskali, one of the world's largest potash fertilizer producers.
The EU is imposing the sectoral sanctions on Belarus in the wake of the forced diversion of a Vilnius-bound Ryanair 
passenger flight to Minsk in late May to detain opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia 
Sapega.

Lithuania won't manage to quickly replace Belarusian cargo, businesses might need help
VILNIUS, Jun 23, BNS – As the European Union is set to ban exports of potassium fertilizers from Belarus via the 
Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, the latter will find it hard to quickly find alternatives, say an economist and a 
representatives of the country's association of stevedoring companies.
Vaidotas Sileika, president of the Association of Lithuanian Stevedoring Companies, who also leads one of the 
largest stevedoring companies, Klaipedos Kontaineriu Terminalas (Klaipeda Container Terminal, or BKT), says that 
the situation after the loss of Belarusian cargo would be difficult since there's hardly any alternative cargo that could 
replace it.
"If in the short term, today, we lost the Belarusian flow, so I think the situation would be fairly complicated," he told 
BNS. "There's no cargo that has no port. In fact, all cargo moving via the Baltic states today, it would be difficult to 
lure it elsewhere as it would be a long period. It depends not only on the input of port companies, but also on rail 
rates and other things."
The EU is gearing up this week to impose sectoral sanctions for Belarus in response to the forced diversion and 
landing by Belarus of a Ryanair passenger plane, en route from Athens to Vilnius, in Minsk to detain a Belarusian 
opposition blogger. The sanction package will cover seven sectors, including the Belarusian trade in potassium 
fertilizers with the EU.
Sileika says that not only his company BKT but also other businesses would feel the impact of the loss of 
Belarusian fertilizers as some 1 million tons of Belarusian fertilizers, transported in containers, are not handled via 
BKT. Moreover, competition for the remaining cargo among port companies would grow.
Lithuania won't manage to quickly replace Belarusian cargo, businesses might need help
Indre Genyte-Pikciene, an economist from INVL Asset Management, also says it's impossible for Klaipeda to 
quickly replace Belarusian cargo.
"Of course, it will not happen in a day, that's a fact," she told BNS.
In her words, both the port of Klaipeda and Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai (Lithuanian Railways), the country's state-owned 
railway company that carries Belarusian cargo, are very much dependent on Belarus, and the existing stable inflow 
of cargo is a certain "comfort zone" the companies did not even want to move in 2014 when the Ukrainian-Russian 
conflict broke out.
Turkey and Ukraine as alternatives?
Algis Latakas, CEO of the port of Klaipeda, hinted earlier that Lithuania might start looking at the Turkish and 
Ukrainian market amid the threat of losing Belarusian cargo.
But Genyte-Pikciene says many questions arise in the existing context as to how cargo from Turkey or Ukraine 
would be carried.
"It will very much depend on sanctions and whether sanctions will include transit. If they do, then a lot of questions 
arise as to how that will be separated from Belarusian goods," the economist said.
Sileika is also skeptical about the possibility to compensate the loss of Belarusian cargo with cargo from Turkey or 
Ukraine.
"In reality, we can hardly expect big flows from these directions to compensate for the lost ones we have now. It will 
take time for us to link certain flows with certain countries and find new clients," he said.

Lithuania's Klaipeda port, LG need to think about diversification – adviser
VILNIUS, Jun 22, BNS – Lithuania's ports of Klaipeda and Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai (Lithuanian Railways), the 
country's state-owned railway company, need to think about diversification as the European Union is set to impose 
sectoral sanctions for Belarus, says Asta Skaisgiryte, an adviser to Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda.
"Our port and railways should potentially think already about greater diversification as, obviously, it cannot be the 
way it used to be. And they should also think about ways to fill in those gaps that will appear when Belarus diverts 
its cargo via Russia," she told the Ziniu Radijas news radio on Tuesday morning.
On Monday, On Monday, EU foreign ministers agreed on sectoral sanctions for the Belarusian economy as the EU 
is beefing up pressure for the Minsk regime in response to the forced diversion and landing of a Ryanair passenger 
plane in late May to detain Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
The sanction package covers seven sectors of the Belarusian economy, including trade in Belarusian fertilizers.
The European Council will discuss the sanctions on Thursday. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda has said he 
will back the EU agreement on these sanctions, whatever it might be.
Several diplomatic sources earlier told BNS exports and transit of fertilizers produced in Belarus via EU countries, 
including Lithuania, would have to be stopped once the EU agreed to impose sectoral sanctions for Belarus.
Belarus is home to one of the world's biggest potassium fertilizer producers, Belaruskali, which exports via the 
Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and uses services of Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai (Lithuanian Railways), the country's state-
owned railway company.

Belaruskali fertilizers are handled by the Klaipeda-based company Biriu kroviniu Terminal (Bulk Cargo Terminal), 
and Belaruskali has a 30 percent stake in this company. These companies would lose tens of millions euros 
annually without Belaruskali fertilizers.

EU formins approve sanctions against Belarusian regime
TALLINN, Jun 22, BNS - The foreign ministers attending a meeting of the European Union's Foreign Affairs Council 
(FAC) decided to impose restrictive measures against 78 Belarusian individuals and eight entities.
The decision was made in response to widespread human rights violations in Belarus and the forced landing of a 
passenger plane en route from Greece to Lithuania at the end of May in Minsk, spokespeople for the Estonian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
"As the state hijacking of a Ryanair plane a month ago and the arrest of an opposition journalist on board have 
shown, the Belarusian regime has become dangerous not only for its own people but also for the citizens of the 
European Union. The coercive measures imposed are specifically directed against the regime of Alexander 
Lukashenko and his associates, who have been committing human rights violations for a long time. At the same 
time, in order to maximize our impact, it is important that our actions regarding Belarus are coordinated with the 
United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and other like-minded countries," Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets 
said.
"We must certainly continue to support Belarusian civil society in their quest for democratic elections, as was also 
discussed at a breakfast with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya before the Council. There are good opportunities for this, 
for example, by offering scholarships to students who are unable to continue their studies in Belarus, providing 
psychological assistance to victims of the regime or supporting independent journalists there," the minister added.
The meeting also addressed the issue of Iraq, which focused on the fragile security situation there and the 
forthcoming elections. "It is important for us to contribute to the Iraqi government's efforts to ensure a stable and 
secure country through reforms. It is important that the European Union finds ways to help Iraq hold free and fair 
elections. We support the deployment of an election observation mission to Iraq if the security situation allows," 
Liimets said.
EU formins approve sanctions against Belarusian regime
The foreign ministers also discussed closer relations with Latin America and the Caribbean and received an 
overview of the activities of EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell towards Lebanon, Ethiopia and Indonesia. The 
meeting also addressed Russia, the Middle East peace process and emphasized the need to move forward with the 
EU-Turkey cooperation agenda.

There's a chance Minsk sanctions will affect Lithuania – formin
VILNIUS, Jun 22, BNS – The European Union's new package of sanctions for Belarus might also affect Lithuania, 
the country's Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis says, adding that work on the details is still ongoing.
On Monday, EU foreign ministers agreed on sectoral sanctions for the Belarusian economy as the EU is beefing up 
pressure for the Minsk regime in response to the forced diversion and landing of a Ryanair passenger plane in late 
May.
"There's a possibility that it will affect Lithuania. (…) But lawyers are expected to prepare explanatory notes 
specifically on transit, on the scope of sanctions. And then with those explanations in mind, heads of state will 
endorse," Landsbergis told the national radio LRT on Tuesday, adding that work is still in progress on certain 
specific details.
The foreign minister did not elaborate on which Belarusian business sectors would be affected by the sanction 
package but added that the affected areas would include potassium fertilizers and oil.
"I wouldn't want to speculate as the list is not finished yet and it should be published on Thursday during the 
European Council. As far as I know, there are seven sectors that are on the sectoral sanction list," Landsbergis 
said.
As the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday the EU cold draft a fifth package of sanctions for 
Belarus, the Lithuanian foreign minister says it sends an important message to the Belarusian regime.
"I believe it’s a very important signal. (…) It also sends a message that (the existing sanction package – BNS) is not 
necessarily final and the European Union can moved further and step it up. So, Lukashenko is still left with certain 
space for the regime to rethink and change its action and release political prisoners, stop its crackdown on the 
opposition and, finally, allow holding a free election," Landsbergis said.
There's a chance Minsk sanctions will affect Lithuania – formin
As more and more illegal migrants, mostly Iraqis, enter Lithuania from Belarus, the minister said Lithuania could 
receive assistance from the European Union.
"I had several occasions to express Lithuania's position. So, first of all, I informed by colleagues about the existing 
situation in Lithuania and said that a day might come when we would need assistance from partners and from EU 
institutions. (…) I was really assured by my colleagues that assistance would be provided," Landsbergis said.
While in Brussels, Landsbergis also asked his Iraqi counterpart Fuad Hussein for assistance in returning illegal 
migrants from this country, crossing into Lithuania from Belarus.
Landsbergis told BNS on Monday the two ministers discussed possibilities for Iraq to delegate a consular official to 
Lithuania to help identify Iraqi citizens who had arrived in Lithuania and later failed to get asylum, and also assist in 
preparation of documents for their return to Iraq.
The Lithuanian minister also asked his Iraqi counterpart to accept a Lithuanian border officer at Baghdad Airport to 
help step up control of Iraqis flying to Minsk.

Fertilizer exports via Lithuania can be suspended if EU imposes sanctions for Belarus
VILNIUS, Jun 21, BNS – If the European Union agrees on sectoral sanctions for Belarus, exports of fertilizers 
produced in this country via EU countries, including Lithuania, should be suspended, diplomatic sources have told 
BNS.
The legislative process in the EU to endorse sanctions is ongoing and is expected to be finished on Thursday, the 
two sources said, adding that the package of sectoral sanctions, now being drafted, has received approval from EU 
foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday. It covers seven economy sectors, including trade in Belarusian fertilizers.
"If that is confirmed, fertilizer transit via the EU and imports into EU countries will stop," one of the diplomatic 
sources told BNS.
Belarus is home to one of the biggest potassium fertilizer producer, Belaruskali. The company exports via the 
Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and used services of Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai (Lithuanian Railways), the country's state-

Belaruskali fertilizers are handled by the Klaipeda-based company Biriu kroviniu Terminal (Bulk Cargo Terminal).

regime of a Ryanair passenger plane, en route from Athens to Vilnius, in late May to detain opposition blogger 
Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis says EU sanctions are aimed at forcing the Lukashenko regime 
to change its policies, and economic pressure on Minsk, also felt by Russia, could ensure that.

"Russia will have to refinance everything that (Belarus) loses," he told journalists upon arrival to the ministerial 
meeting in Brussels on Monday. "This means Putin might call his good friend Lukashenko and ask him not to take 
certain steps, release political prisoners, to change the policy. (...) It could be quite effective."
EU leader will also discuss sectoral sanctions for Belarus on Thursday. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda has 
vowed to back an EU agreement on these sanctions, whatever it might be.

Latvia supports decision of European Union to adopt a package of sanctions against Lukashenko’s regime - 
Rinkevics
RIGA, Jun 21, BNS - On June 21, in Luxembourg, the European Union’s Foreign Affairs Council gathered for a 
meeting at which the EU Foreign Affairs Ministers discussed the developments in Belarus, the EU’s cooperation 
with Latin American countries, as well as the state of affairs in Iraq, BNS learned from the Latvian Foreign Ministry.
The Council also featured an informal exchange with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq, Fuad 
Hussein.
Latvia fully supports the decision of the European Union to adopt a new package of restrictive measures against the 
Lukashenko regime related to the unlawful forced landing of a Ryanair plane and the government’s repression of 
the opposition, noted the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia, Edgars Rinkevics. He also noted that the sanctions 
are not aimed at Belarusian people but instead target the regime of Alexander Lukashenko and his officials. It is 
vital to preserve unity also concerning sector-specific restrictive measures. The broad range of sector-specific 
sanctions is sending a strong signal to Lukashenko and to both Belarusian and EU society, Rinkevics said in his 
remarks to the Council.
Latvia has been actively contributing to the preparation of the restrictive measures and calling on Belarusian 
officials to respect human rights, cease repression of civil society and release all political prisoners.
The EU Foreign Affairs Council was preceded by an informal meeting with the leader of the Belarusian opposition, 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Rinkevics said he was certain that Belarusian society can count on an unwavering 
support from Latvia in the fight for the compliance with democratic freedoms and human right.  Latvia’s support to

date for Belarusian society involves direct assistance to those who have been affected by protests and suffered 
from repression as well as to the media and independent journalists.
The resilience of the Belarusian society and its ability to preserve fighting spirit under the conditions of increasing 
authoritarianism deserves the greatest respect. Therefore, it is essential that Belarusian civilian forces consider 
prospective reforms and work to do, so that they could build a new democratic, lawful and prosperous Belarus after 
Lukashenko leaves.

Sanctions for Belarus' fertilizer sector will be imposed in stages – Lithuanian formin
VILNIUS, Jun 21, BNS – The European Union's sanctions for Belarus' fertilizer sector will be introduced in stages, 
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis says.
"Obviously, the introduction of sanctions will come in stages not to cover the whole sector at once," Landsbergis 
told BNS by phone from Brussels on Monday.
His comment came as the EU is set to finalize a package of sectoral sanctions for Belarus, covering seven sectors 
of its economy, including trade in Belarusian fertilizers.
Belarus is home to one of the world's biggest potassium fertilizer producers, Belaruskali, which exports via the 
Lithuanian port of Klaipeda and uses services of Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai (Lithuanian Railways), the country's state-
owned railway company.
Belaruskali fertilizers are handled by the Klaipeda-based company Biriu kroviniu Terminal (Bulk Cargo Terminal), 
and Belaruskali has a 30 percent stake in this company. These companies would lose tens of millions euros 
annually without Belaruskali fertilizers.
The introduction of sanctions in stages means that Belarus will be banned from exporting some of its products via 
the EU and the list will be gradually expanded, Landsbergis said.
He could not provide any details, stating that there's no final agreement on them yet.
Sectoral sanctions for Belarus were on Monday backed by EU foreign ministers and they are expected to be finally 
endorsed on Thursday. An EU summit will also be held on the same day.

Landsbergis says the sanction package should be "as comprehensive as possible". In his words, such sanctions 
would be aimed to make the Belarusian regime to change its policies.
"The sanction's secondary effect would be that the Belarusian regime's losses would have to be refinanced and 
only Russia can do that. This way the EU and Lithuania, through the introduction of sanctions, would put part of 
them on Russia which can have impact on Belarus," the Lithuanian foreign minister said.
Sectoral sanctions for Belarus would come in response to the forced diversion and landing by the Minsk regime of a 
Ryanair passenger plane, en route from Athens to Vilnius, in late May to detain opposition blogger Raman 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega.

Risk of terrorists, KGN agents entering Lithuania grows with rising migration – SSD chief (media)
VILNIUS, Jun 16, BNS – As the inflow of migrants crossing the Belarusian-Lithuanian border grows, Lithuania's 
intelligence sees a higher risk of terrorists and people recruited by the Lukashenko regime entering Lithuania, 
Darius Jauniskis, director of Lithuania's State Security Department, says.
"I do understand we cannot put stamps on everyone and we in no way consider everyone criminals or spies, but 
that risk grows with an increasing inflow of refugees," he said in an interview with the 15min.lt news website.
Around 400 illegal migrants, mainly Iraq citizens, have tried to enter Lithuania from Belarus so far this year, which is 
five times more than over the whole year of 2020. It is causing more responsibility for Lithuania's intelligence to 
make sure no terrorists, as well as people infiltrated by special services, enter the country.
"As a risk, I see that if a higher number of people arrive in our state, especially if we pay attention to where they 
come from, we view it through another prism, in terms of the threat of terrorism. We very often don’t know who is 
entering our country as it's fairly hard to check facts as those people often don't have documents, they lie about 
their profession and education. In this respect, the SSD, responsible for the terrorism situation, should be very 
much concerned about that, and we are," Jauniskis said.
He also called the forced diversion and landing of a Ryanair passenger plane in Minsk in May "bold and brass", 
adding that Lithuania's intelligence is now working to get more specific information about this incident.
Meanwhile, the West's response to the Ryanair plane incident has pushed Belarus further towards the Russian 
side, which is very beneficial for Russia, Jauniskis said.

"So, we are watching increasingly deeper integration into the common state. I would not be surprised if certain 
processes take place soon and we will see Belarus as just an integral part of Russia. For Lithuania, it means that 
we will have a border with Russia. The imaginary buffer zone would just disappear," the SSD chief said.

Lithuania’s formin welcomes EU decision to sanction human rights abusers in Belarus
VILNIUS, Jun 16, BNS – Lithuania’s Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis has welcomed the European Union’s 
(EU) decision to sanction a long list of human rights abusers in Belarus.
EU ambassadors agreed on Wednesday to impose sanctions on 78 individuals and seven entities responsible for 
repressions and systemic violations of human rights in Belarus.
“We welcome the agreement reached by EU Member States on one of the longest list of specific individuals and 
legal entities that contributed in person to the violations of human rights in Belarus,” Landsbergis said.
He added that the list had been in development since March, when the regime of Alexander Lukashenko unleashed 
new repressions against the media and journalists in Belarus and continued its brutal violations of human rights.
The measures agreed by ambassadors are set to be formally adopted on Monday, June 21, when EU foreign 
ministers meet.
“Obviously, the EU takes ambitious and coherent actions and will not tolerate crimes of the regime,” the Lithuanian 
minister said.
Several individuals and an entity added to the list are linked directly to the incident involving the Ryanair passenger 
jet last month.

Lithuania’s top prosecutor: probe into diversion of Ryanair flight to Belarus underway
VILNIUS, Jun 15, BNS – A probe into the forced grounding of a Ryanair flight by the Belarusian regime, which then 
detained Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend, is underway at a sufficiently intensive 
pace, Lithuanian Prosecutor General Nida Grunskiene has said.
“The pre-trial investigation is underway at a sufficiently intensive pace. We have formed a joint investigation team 
with Polish officials and European Investigation Orders have been sent to several more countries, such as Greece 
and Ireland. Also, we cooperate with Ryanair. It would be good if that cooperation were more goodwill, but we have 
what we have,” she told reporters at the Seimas on Tuesday.
Prosecutors would like the air carrier to provide the requested information “somewhat faster”, the prosecutor 
general explained.
There had not been any suspects named thus far, Grunskiene said.
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were detained in Minsk on May 23 after the Belarusian regime forced a 
Ryanair passenger plane en route from Athens to Vilnius to divert and land in Minsk, sparking outrage in the West 
and calls for tougher sanctions for the Minsk regime.

Greece pledges help for Lithuania to manage flow of migrants from Belarus (further expands)
VILNIUS, Jun 15, BNS – Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, currently in Vilnius, has pledged to help Lithuania 
to manage the inflow of illegal migrants from Belarus.
Greece faced a major migration crisis in the middle of last decade when asylum seekers from the Middle East 
started coming to the country via the Mediterranean Sea en masse.
"We can help in any way Lithuania sees fit," the Greek minister told a joint press conference with Lithuanian Foreign 
Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday. "We have the experience of the bigger neighbor pushing, 
instrumentalizing the migration phenomenon."
Landsbergis said he asked the Greek minister "for advice and technical assistance" since his country "has been 
dealing with the refugee problem much longer".
Greek officers could come to Lithuania to consult border guards and officers from the Interior Ministry, Landsbergis 
said, adding that Greece had a lot of experience in applying EU law when processing asylum seekers' applications 
and could also help on these matters.
"Lithuania has never been a refugee accepting country, a country of initial acceptation. And Greece has," 
Landsbergis said.
“Hybrid instrument”
Lithuania has recently seen a dramatic increase in the inflow of illegal migrants from Belarus, with Lithuanian 
officials saying that the Minsk regime is helping migrants cross the Lithuanian border.
Greece pledges help for Lithuania to manage flow of migrants from Belarus (further expands)
Landsbergis claims the Belarusian regime "is actively organizing the refugee program and is using it against 
Lithuania as one of the hybrid instruments".
"It means that what we see now can be only the beginning, - he said. - If the figures grow, if the situation continues 
to worsen, we will definitely need partners' assistance."
The Greek minister said Athens could send its officers to Lithuanian to share their knowledge and would also help 
to raise the issue at the EU level.
"This is a European challenge," he said.
Some 387 illegal migrants, mainly Iraqi citizens, have been detained while crossing illegally into Lithuania from 
Belarus this year, compared to 81 last year, 46 in 2019 and 104 in 2018, figures from the country's border guards 
show.
“Piracy”
The two ministers also discussed a recent incident when the Belarusian regime diverted a Ryanair flight en route 
from Athens to Vilnius to detain Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend in Minsk.
Passengers on board of that flight included the citizens of Lithuania, Greece and other countries.
Dendias described the forced diversion of the plane by Belarus as “piracy”.
“We are going to address it accordingly,” the Greek minister said slamming the incident as “totally unacceptable”.
“I totally agree with that,” Landsbergis said.
Following this incident, EU leaders banned Belarusian airlines from flying into the block and also urged EU airlines 
to avoid the Belarusian airspace.
EU leaders also asked the Community’s institutions to draw up further "targeted economic sanctions" for Belarus 
and expand the blacklist of subjects linked to the ongoing crackdown against the opposition.

Germany’s KfW refuses to finance projects related to Belarus N-plant – Lithuanian energmin
VILNIUS, Jun 15, BNS – Germany’s KfW Ipex-Bank has refused to finance projects related to the Belarusian 
nuclear power plant in Astravyets and has cancelled a 100-million-euro loan for Belarus, Lithuania’s Energy Minister 
has said in a Facebook post.
According to Dainius Kreivys, this decision made by the German bank is most likely related to the decision to 
withdraw guarantee offers made by the Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN) in May.
“It was the Belarusian opposition and the Belarusian diaspora in Sweden and Germany who did most of the work in 
this case. An extensive journalistic investigation about Swedish companies involved in the Astravyets’ project was 
carried out in Sweden solely thanks to the efforts made by the Belarusian opposition,” the minister wrote on 
Facebook.
EKN considered issuing guarantees totaling two billion Swedish kronor (EUR 197 mln) for projects carried out by a 
Swedish subsidiary of Germany's Siemens in the regions of Minsk and Brest, but decided to withdraw the export 
guarantee offers in May.
The agency then told BNS that this decision had been made due to Belarus’ failure to live up to human rights 
standards.
The projects, which Germany’s KfW IPEX Bank and Landesbank Hessen Thuringen Girozentrale earlier intended to 
finance, are related to the Astravyets nuclear facility and its emergency reserve.
Pressure on Western companies to withdraw from the projects related to the Belarusian nuclear power plant 
increased further in May after the diversion of a Ryanair flight en route to Vilnius by the Minsk regime and the 
following detention of Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich who was onboard.

Lithuanian president to raise regional security issues at NATO summit
VILNIUS, Jun 14, BNS – Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda will on Monday attend a NATO summit in Brussels 
where he will raise regional security issues amid tensions between the West and Russia and Belarus.
NATO leaders will also discuss challenges to collective security and matters related to enhanced response, the 
presidential press service said.
The summit will be attended by US President Joe Biden for the first time.
The summit will be an opportunity "to strengthen the vital transatlantic bond between Europe and North America 
and its irreplaceability, ensuring the security of the entire Euro-Atlantic area", according to the statement.
In order to respond to changes of geopolitical situation, leader also plan to discuss the implementation of 
deterrence and defense and allies’ commitments to collective security.
At the meeting, the leaders will discuss the strengthening of the Alliance’s defense capabilities, the need for 
increased investment in defense and the enhancement of the international community’s relations based on the rule 
of law.
Regarding NATO 2030 initiative, NATO leaders will take ambitious decisions necessary for successful future 
adaptation of the Alliance and discuss the renewal of NATO Strategic Concept.
Tensions between the West and Minsk have been rising since last year when authoritarian Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko, who is ruling Belarus for a third decade already, was declared winner of the presidential 
election and then started cracking down on the opposition and the regime's critic.
Lithuanian president to raise regional security issues at NATO summit
The relations between the West and Minsk soured further after Belarus forced a Ryanair plane en route from 
Athens to Vilnius to divert and land in Minsk so that Belarusian services could detain opposition blogger Raman 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapiega. This incident will also be discussed during the NATO summit.
Allies have deployed international battalions in the Baltic states and Poland since 2017 to deter Russia in response 
to its actions in Ukraine.
Lithuania also wants guarantees from the Alliance on boosting air and marine defense capabilities.

Lithuania's Nauseda wants more NATO guarantees, decisiveness on Russia
VILNIUS, Jun 14, BNS – Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, having arrived in Brussels on Monday to attend a 
NATO summit, says the Alliance needs a specific plan on ways to bolster its regional capabilities in case of a crisis.
He also urged the Alliance to be more decisive in response to Russia's aggressive action.
"I think we need to have to be very clear, united and decisive to the activities of Russia. We should be united in this 
regard," Nauseda told journalists in Brussels.
He vows to underline regional security issues during the upcoming summit and urged NATO to provide more 
guarantees to countries in this region.
NATO needs to beef up its collective defense and deterrence and have plans on sending additional forces to the 
region in case of a crisis, Nauseda said.
"In the current environment, the speed of reaction is critically important. We need to have concrete plans, concrete 
schemes on how to be aware and responsible and resilient to any kind of actions which could be related to direct 
military actions, hybrid actions or cyber security actions," the Lithuanian leader said.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said ahead of the summit in Brussels that the Alliance's relations with 
Russia are now the worst since the end of the Cold War. Tensions between the Kremlin and Western democracies 
increased following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. NATO deployed international battalions to the Baltic states 
and Poland in 2017.
Nauseda also warned that Belarus is causing problems in the region as well.
Lithuania 's Nauseda wants more NATO guarantees, decisiveness on Russia
"You can see what is happening in this country. A non-legitimate regime becomes desperate and is ready to 
threaten even the lives of civil people by hijacking an airplane," the Lithuanian president said, having in mind the 
forced diversion to and landing of a Ryanair plane en route from Athens to Vilnius in Minsk in late May.
"We see efforts of Russia to swallow this country, to set it as a platzdarm for further activities of Russia because 
Belarus is losing the last elements of its independence," he said.
It will be the first NATO summit for US President Joe Biden who is scheduled to meet with Russian President 
Vladimir Putin in Geneva later this week.
Nauseda expects that Biden "will send very clear messages about the decisiveness and unity of NATO and will 
react with very clear messages to what has been happening recently. We cannot go to having closer contact with 
Russia until Russia changes its pattern of behavior," the Lithuanian president said.
He also said Lithuania stand ready to host a NATO summit in 2023.

Austria’s chancellor thanks Lithuania for support for Belarusian opposition
VILNIUS, Jun 11, BNS - Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz thanked Lithuania for support for Belarusian 
opposition and pledged assistance during his meeting with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte who arrived 
on an official two-day visit to Vienna on Friday.
“We focused on European issues and the situation in Belarus. We would like to thank Lithuania for your support for 
the Belarusian opposition and we will try to be as supportive as possible,” the Austrian leader said during a news 
conference after his meeting with Simonyte.
“We demand free and fair presidential election in Belarus as well as the immediate release of a journalist recently 
detained from the Ryanair flight, as well of all other political prisoners. The EU has reacted quickly and we of course 
support further sanctions against the regime if necessary. We hope that it will be possible to get a better situation 
here, but if not, there will be strong reaction by the EU,” Kurz added.
Lithuanian prime minister said during the news conference that the interception of a civil flight showed that “the 
regimes that were already called unpredictable, can be even more unpredictable, and won't stop”.
The EU and other Western countries have been stepping up pressure on Belarus since the presidential election in 
August, 2020 when authoritarian Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner. Western 
countries do not accept the vote's legitimacy.
Tensions rose further after a Ryanair passenger plane en route from Athens to Vilnius was diverted and forced to 
land in Minsk and Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his Russian-citizen girlfriend Sofia Sapega 
were detained at the airport on May 23.
Following this incident, EU leaders asked the Community’s institutions to draw up further "targeted economic 
sanctions" for Belarus and expand the blacklist of subjects linked to the ongoing crackdown against the opposition.

European Parlt calls for more sanctions against Belarus
TALLINN, Jun 11, BNS – The European Parliament strongly condemns the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in 
Minsk and the detention of Belarusian journalist Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega and is calling for more 
sanctions against Belarus.
The Parliament is calling on the EU to punish those involved in forcing a plane to land in Minsk on May 23 and in 
the detention of journalist Raman Pratasevich.
In a resolution adopted on Thursday with 626 votes in favor, 16 against and 36 abstentions, MEPs strongly 
condemn the "Ryanair hijacking" as an act of 'state terrorism', and call for Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega, as 
well as all other political prisoners in Belarus, to be immediately and unconditionally released.
The resolution urges the Council to sanction the Belarusian individuals and entities involved in the forced landing 
and the abductions as soon as possible.
EU member states must also proceed with utmost urgency with the next package of sanctions against those who 
took part in or were complicit in electoral fraud last year and the subsequent human rights violations in Belarus, 
says the text.  Prosecutors, judges and law-enforcement employees who play a role in the repression should be on 
the sanctions list, as should agents working on disinformation, media, propaganda and officials supporting the 
regime, such as Marat Markov, who interviewed Raman Pratasevich on the state channel ONT on June 2.
In addition, MEPs call for swift economic and sectoral measures targeting key Belarusian industries, in particular 
the crude oil and oil-products, potash, steel and wood-processing sectors. Financial support to the regime must be 
strictly denied, any new credit lines to the country’s banks refused, and investments in infrastructure or economic 
undertakings must be halted. European financial institutions must be prevented from acquiring bonds or any other 
financial instrument issued by the Belarusian government and affiliated public institutions.
European Parlt calls for more sanctions against Belarus
The resolution also calls for Belarus to be suspended from international sport bodies and international events, 
including European and world championships, and the Olympic Games in Tokyo. MEPs further urge the Union of 
European Football Associations (UEFA) to remove broadcasting rights for the upcoming EURO 2020 football 
tournament from Belarusian state television TVR and assign them to the independent Belsat TV free of charge.
The text similarly addresses a wide range of other issues to do with EU-Belarus relations.
Ahead of the vote, MEPs also debated the continuous systemic crackdown and human rights violations in Belarus 
with EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell on Tuesday, June 8.

Govt lifts flight ban imposed by Estonia on Belarusian companies
TALLINN, Jun 10, BNS - As the Council of the European Union imposed a flight ban on Belarusian companies, the 
ban imposed by Estonia is no longer necessary and the government lifted it on Thursday.
As the sanctions imposed by the Council of the European Union came into force on Belarus on June 4, the legal 
basis for the imposition of a flight ban on Belarus in Estonia will change and the government will lift the Estonian 
flight ban, government spokespeople said.
This means that under the sanctions imposed by the EU Council, Belarusian airlines are not allowed to land in, take 
off from and fly over EU airspace throughout the EU, including Estonia. Therefore, a separate sanction by the 
Estonian government is no longer necessary.
The government sanction concerning the flight ban was imposed in connection with the forced diversion of a 
Ryanair passenger jet by Belarus to Minsk on May 23. A Belarusian military aircraft, MIG-29, and a bomb threat 
were used to force the passenger plane, which was en route from Athens to Vilnius and was carrying more than 
100 passengers from 17 countries, including EU member states, to land. After the plane had landed in Minsk, the 
Belarus authorities detained Raman Pratasevich, an independent Belarusian journalist and co-creator of the 
Telegram channel NEXTA, who was on board the flight, as well as his companion.
EU heads of state and government strongly condemned the actions of the Belarusian authorities and demanded the 
immediate release of the detainees. In addition to the flight ban, EU leaders agreed at the Council that the EU 
would rapidly prepare and impose additional sanctions on Belarusian officials and companies closely associated 
with the regime, and develop economic sanctions. The flight ban is part of this package.

Lithuania’s president slams “dictators watching action films”, calls to strengthen defense
VILNIUS, Jun 08, BNS – With relations with Eastern neighbors getting sour, Lithuania should resist their pressure, 
pursue regional stability and strengthen defense capabilities, Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda has said on 
Tuesday.
“Beyond Lithuania’s eastern borders there is an unstable space where inherent human rights and the rules of the 
free world are disrespected, where dictators who watch action films step into the role of terrorists and hijack 
passenger planes. Where border and nuclear security becomes a tool of blackmail,” he said while delivering his 
annual State of the Nation Address in the Seimas.
He referred to an incident that occurred in late May when a Ryanair passenger plane en route from Athens to 
Vilnius was diverted and forced to land in Minsk and Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his 
Russian-citizen girlfriend Sofia Sapega were detained at the airport.
This incident further exacerbated tensions in relations between Lithuania and Belarus.
Moreover, Lithuania has recently seen an increase in the flows of illegal migrants entering the country from Belarus 
and suspects that Belarusian officers could be involved in organized transportation of illegal migrants from the 
neighboring country.
According to Nauseda, Lithuania would be much safer if it had more stable democracies in its neighborhood.
In his view, the most important task today is to stop, together with allies, Russia’s expansion and prevent further 
destabilization of the region.
Lithuania ’s president slams “dictators watching action films”, calls to strengthen defense
“We must strive to give our neighbors the opportunity to decide freely and democratically on their lives,” the 
Lithuanian leader said.
“The asylum we offer to the people of Belarus, our support to civil society, the loud voice of Lithuania reminding 
Europe of what is happening at its borders is the least we can and must do for our neighbors,” he added.
Nauseda called to focus on deterrence in the Baltic States, to strengthen NATO’s forward presence and air policing 
mission, and to prepare specific defense plans while the emerging threats could be countered by ensuring the 
active involvement of the United States in the region’s security.
“We must secure continued rotational presence of U.S. forces in Lithuania and their permanent presence as close 
as possible to our borders,” the Lithuanian president said adding that he would speak about this at the NATO 
summit due in Brussels next week.
He also pointed out that Lithuania should also respect its commitment to consistently increase defense funding to 
2.5 percent of GDP by 2030, enhance its military capabilities, participate actively in international missions, and build 
a civil society “from the school bench”.
According to Nauseda, Lithuania should also keep the European Union’s attention on the Eastern Partnership.
“We cannot allow one-off failures or frustrations to obscure the efforts made in Ukraine, Moldova and the South 
Caucasus. Lithuania has an exceptional, I would say, a historic role here,” he said.
The Lithuanian leader on Tuesday delivers his second annual State of the Nation Address in the parliament.
The country's president has a duty to deliver an annual address in the Seimas under the Constitution.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport sees past 9 mos' highest passenger numbers in May
TALLINN, Jun 04, BNS – In May, Tallinn Airport provided services to 54,889 passengers, marking the highest 
number of passengers per month over the past nine months.
Eero Pargmae, commercial director of Tallinn Airport, said that it can be seen that so-called accumulated demand 
has emerged in the holiday travel segment.
"Figuratively speaking, flying is seemingly behind a dam, which moves quickly when the restrictions are eased. Pre-
sales of holiday routes are generally going well for companies, as people actually want to travel again. This is also 
reflected in recent airline decisions, which namely focus on the opening of holiday routes and at significantly shorter 
notice than usual," Pargmae said in a press release.
He added that many European countries have already eased restrictions or are doing so in the near future, which 
will certainly add courage and make travel easier. "Of course, vaccination plays a very important role in the 
recovery of travel, and vaccine passports and other possible solutions that facilitate cross-border movement will 
become important," Pargmae said.
In May, Ryanair's flights to Paphos, Air Baltic's flights to Paris and Munich, Aegean Airlines' flights to Athens and 
Wizzair's flights to Kharkiv were added to the flight schedule. There were also a few flights to Brussels and 
Moscow.
As a new carrier, Nyxair started flying to Helsinki in cooperation with Diamond Sky, the flights will initially take place 
three times a week with a 34-seat Saab340 aircraft. In total, there were regular flights to 24 different destinations in 
May.
In May, charter flights to Antalya, Heraklion and Rhodes began. Almost a quarter of all passengers passing through 
Tallinn Airport used charter flights.

There were 1,881 flights in May, which is an average of 60 landings and take-offs a day. The average load factor on 
scheduled flights was 46 percent.
In the last five months, 185,581 passengers have passed through the airport and 7,301 flights have taken place.

Stoltenberg: NATO is united on Belarus
VILNIUS, Jun 04, BNS – NATO stands united in its condemnation of Belarus' forced diversion of a Vilnius-bound 
flight from Athens to Minsk, Jens Stoltenberg, the Alliance's secretary general, said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg was asked about the Alliance's unity on Belarus following media reports that Turkey had pushed NATO 
allies into softening its statement on the incident.
"NATO is united and NATO allies, all 30 NATO allies, agreed a very strong statement last week, where we strongly 
condemned the forced landing of civilian aircraft on its way from one NATO capital Athens to another NATO capital 
Vilnius," the secretary general told a joint news conference with Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte in 
Brussels.
"This was a very clear and strong political message," he added.
Reuters reported last week that "Turkey pushed NATO allies into watering down an official reaction" to the forced 
landing of the Ryanair flight and the detention of Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his 
girlfriend Sofia Sapiega.
On May 26, NATO released a two-paragraph statement condemning the forcing down of the flight to arrest 
Pratasevich, but “did not include any punitive steps that Baltic allies and Poland had pressed for," the news agency 
said.
It noted that the statement was less strident than Stoltenberg's public remarks.
On Thursday, NATO's secretary general also welcomed decisions by the United States, the United Kingdom and 
the European Union to impose sanctions on members of the Belarussian regime.
Stoltenberg: NATO is united on Belarus
"We have to demonstrate that there are costs and consequences when basic international norms and rules are 
violated," he said.
Simonyte described NATO's statement on Belarus' actions as "strong and timely".
"Most of the international community reacted promptly and strongly, but this is not the end of the story," she told the 
news conference. "We should also maintain our pressure on the Lukashenko regime and also on the Kremlin."
Belarus' regime must release political prisoners and allow free, democratic elections to take place in the country, 
according to the prime minister.
Stoltenberg said that the forced diversion of the passenger plane would be discussed at NATO's summit in mid-
June, too.
Paradoxical security situation 
During their meeting in Brussels, Simonyte and Stoltenberg also discussed security challenges, NATO's presence 
in the region, and Lithuania's contribution to the Alliance.
The prime minister noted that the region is facing new threats and challenges, including hybrid and cyber ones.
"We see the situation as a little bit of a paradox," the prime minister told the news conference.
"On one hand, Lithuania has never been safer than it is now, being member of so many strong international 
organizations, NATO, the EU [and] the OECD, but on the other hand, the situation around us in the region is not 
only unstable, but also deteriorating, and definitely we need to strengthen our emphasis on deterrence and defense 
as much as possible," she said.
Simonyte said that Lithuania is taking steps to beef up its security and defense.
"We are meeting the 2 percent [of GDP defense spending] criteria," the prime minister said at the news conference. 
"The government has an even more ambitious plan for the next 10 years".
"We understand that our security, first and foremost, is our own responsibility. So we need to do as much as we can 
ourselves and do even more together with our partners,” she added.
Speaking about Russia, Stoltenberg noted NATO's dual-track approach to the country, combining deterrence with 
dialog on the future.
"I am looking forward to welcoming president Biden to Brussels. I am confident that when we meet, we will discuss 
a wide range of issues, including NATO relations with Russia," the secretary general said.
"Then I welcome that Biden, after meeting NATO leaders, will travel on and meet with president Putin. It is in line 
with NATO's dual track approach."
"We need deterrence, defense, but also dialog, when it comes to Russia," he added, noting that this would help 
ease tensions between the West and the Kremlin.
The trip to Brussels marked Simonyte's first foreign visit as Lithuania's prime minister.

From burden for Belarusians, Lukashenko is turning into threat for whole region - Rinkevics
RIGA, Jun 4, BNS - Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, who so far has been a big burden for the 
majority of Belarusian people, has also become a threat for the  whole region, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars 
Rinkevics (New Unity) believes.
As BNS was told at the Foreign Ministry, Rinkevics made a working visit to the Danish capital Copenhagen this 
Thursday and Friday to participate in events marking the centenary of diplomatic relations between the Baltic States 
and Denmark. Rinkevics met with Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod and discussed bilateral relations and 
current developments in international relations, the ministry said.
Commenting on recent events in Belarus and the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk, the Latvian minister 
indicated that Lukashenko is now not only a big burden for the majority of Belarusian people but has also become a 
threat for the region as a whole.
Cooperation between Belarus and Russia is increasing as well as Belarus’s dependency on Russia, and one should 
take into account Belarus’s integration with Russia into a single unified state and Russia’s increasingly strong 
backing and advocacy for Belarus. In spite of how Lukashenko has managed to succeed, albeit with Russia’s help, 
in choking off the work and activities of Belarusian civil society, the European Union must continue providing 
support for this civil society, Rinkevics said.
During his meeting with Kofod, the Latvian minister expressed satisfaction at the good and constructive cooperation 
between Latvia and Denmark at various levels and fields. The Minister confirmed his intention to continue a regular 
dialogue between the two countries on bilateral and multilateral issues as well as drawing attention to the excellent 
long-term cooperation with Denmark in defense and culture.
From burden for Belarusians, Lukashenko is turning into threat for whole region - Rinkevics
“This year, on February 7, we celebrated the 100th anniversary since Denmark recognized Latvia de jure. Denmark 
never recognized the Soviet occupation of Latvia; it was one of the countries that helped the Baltic States to be 
heard internationally and offered significant support to Baltic politicians and diplomats in the restoration of Baltic 
independence,” Rinkevics said. He also congratulate his Danish counterpart on the upcoming Constitution Day 
celebrated by Denmark on June 5.
Rinkevics took part in the working lunch of the Danish and Baltic foreign ministersas well as delivered remarks at 
the conference, Together in the Past, Present and Future – 100 Years of Diplomatic Relations between Denmark 
and Latvia, Lithuania & Estonia. The event was opened by Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark.
At the conference, Rinkevics drew the participants’ attention to the fact that, on August 26, along with Estonia and 
Lithuania, Latvia will mark 30 years of renewed diplomatic relations with Denmark. Moral support by the Danish 
society in 1980s and political activity led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at that time, Uffe Elleman-Jensen, 
already before 1991, as well as all the practical help provided by Danish institutions were essential for Latvia in 
becoming a democratic and full-fledged state.
Rinkevics also underlined that Queen Margaret II of Denmark was the first European monarch to visit Latvia after 
the restoration of independence. “The first meeting between eight Nordic-Baltic foreign ministers was held on 
December 20, 1990 in Copenhagen on the occasion of opening of the very first Baltic States Information Centre in a 
Nordic country. Today it is a pleasure to look at our intense dialogue and strong partnership in the Baltic Sea region 
and internationally. We work side by side in the European Union and NATO and other formats to reach our common 
goals of peace and prosperity for our region and people. I would also like to emphasize three directions of future 
cooperation: regional security; renewable energy, digitalisation and strengthening of the NB-8 and its various 
formats,” Rinkevics said.
Denmark’s contribution to Latvia’s security and co-operation in defense has been a key to strengthening regional 
security. Likewise, Denmark’s role in Multinational Division Headquarters North based in Latvia is an excellent 
example of our political and military cooperation. The Riga-based NATO Strategic Communications Centre of 
Excellence has developed world-leading expertise in countering disinformation. Therefore, Denmark’s involvement 
in the Centre gives an excellent example of how to strengthen joint efforts to improve strategic communications 
capabilities within the Alliance and Allied nations, the Latvian minister said.
Rinkevics voiced confidence that renewable energy will become the cornerstone of the energy infrastructure, and 
development of wind energy in the next decade will be of vital importance for the Baltic Sea region.
In concluding his remarks, the Minister emphasized the importance of the NB8 format as a key regional co-
operation format that reflects the shared values and challenges of like-minded countries. “We are like-minded 
partners and share similar views on issues ranging from regional security challenges to wider foreign policy. We 
welcome the new Nordic-Baltic initiatives regarding climate and gender equality that were introduced last year,” he 
said.
Toward the end of his visit, Rinkevics visited the Vestre Cemetery where he laid flowers at the monument to Latvian 
refugees. In the wake of World War II, around 2,000 Latvian refugees found shelter in the displaced persons’ camps 
in Denmark. The monument, installed in 1948, is a reminder of the post-war destinies of Latvian people in Denmark.
On June 3, Rinkevics took part in a dinner hosted by Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary, met with 
members of the Association Denmark-Latvia Association and presented a Certificates of Commendation to the 
Chair of the association, Kirsten Gjaldbæk, diplomats and staff of the Latvian Embassy in Denmark, as well as 
giving interviews to Danish media.
The Association Denmark-Latvia was established in 1992 by a group of Danes with an interest in Latvia. The aim of 
the association is to strengthen and develop relations and cooperation between Danish and Latvian people. It 
provided significant support for Latvia in the 1990s. The association currently has 60 members – comprising both 
Danes and Latvians who together represent Latvia’s diaspora.

Russia's Aeroflot cancels another two flights to Vilnius
VILNIUS, Jun 04, BNS – Russia's Aeroflot has cancelled another two flights from Moscow to Vilnius, scheduled for 
this week and next week, a spokesman for Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Lithuania's 
three international airports, confirmed on Friday.
"Yesterday, we learned that Aeroflot, just like last week, canceled this week's flight and next week's flight for some 
reason known to them," Tadas Vasiliauskas told BNS. "They gave us no further explanation."
"The plane will not come from Moscow, meaning that the flight from Vilnius will not take off either," he added.
This follows the cancelation of Aeroflot's weekly flight to Vilnius last Friday.
Last week, Lithuania banned any flights to or from its airports via Belarusian airspace and closed its airspace to 
Belarusian airlines.
The move came in response to Belarus' forcing down of a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius flight.
In the wake of the incident, EU leaders agreed to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc's airspace and called on EU-
based air carriers to avoid Belarus' airspace.

Discussions on sanctions for Belarus will take time – Lithuanian PM
VILNIUS, Jun 03, BNS – Discussions on sanctions for Belarus will take time but they will definitely take place, says 
Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte, currently in Brussels.
"Discussions on sanctions will take time but they will definitely take place. And we will have an agreement 27 
member states will be able to reach," she told journalists on Thursday.
The EU and other Western countries have been stepping up pressure on Belarus since the presidential election in 
August, 2020 when authoritarian Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared the winner. Western 
countries do not accept the vote's legitimacy.
Tensions rose further after a Ryanair passenger plane en route from Athens to Vilnius was diverted and forced to 
land in Minsk and Belarusian opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his Russian-citizen girlfriend Sofia Spiega 
were detained at the airport.
Following this incident, EU leaders banned Belarusian airlines from flying into the block and also urged EU airlines 
to avoid the Belarusian airspace.
Leaders also asked the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell to draw up further "targeted economic sanctions" for 
Belarus and expand the blacklist of subjects linked to the ongoing crackdown against the opposition. The list now 
includes 88 regime representatives and seven companies.
Speaking of personal sanctions, there's "an issue of how much we lag behind the real life by sanctioning those 
people who are in fact taking part in these horrible things", the Lithuanian prime minister says.

"And when we speak about economic sanctions, so we need to understand that Lukashenko is sitting on bayonets 
and he need to finance those bayonets somehow. The Kremlin regime is helping him with part of funding but the 
other part comes in various ways from the possibilities to be involved in Western markets," Simonyte said.

A week ago, Borrell said a ban for Belarus to exports potassium fertilizers via the Baltic states' pors was among 
possible economic sanctions under discussion.
More attention for Belarusian frontier
On Thursday, Simonyte met with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European 
Commission Ursula von der Leyen.
"We talked more about relations with third countries with Mr. Michel. I am glad that I see a very good Eastern 
Partnership friend," Simonyte said.
She also stressed the importance today more than ever to support the European aspirations of Ukraine, Georgia, 
and Moldova, and to devote more attention to Armenia, Azerbaijan, and civil society of Belarus.
The prime minister also requested greater attention from the European Commission to strengthening border 
controls with Belarus, which is the EU’s eastern border, according to the government's statement.
"We need to seriously step up the protection of our external border for illegal migration not to become a problem not 
only at the southern border where we speak about economic migration, but also here when the state is allegedly 
organizing criminal transportation of migrants," Simonyte said.
Earlier this week, Lithuanian officers says inflows of illegal migrants from the Belarusian side have been growing for 
some time already, adding that local officers might be involved in the process.

Belarus opposition want Biden to present their 'crisis resolution' plan to Putin
VILNIUS, Jun 02, BNS – Belarus' opposition will seek that US President Joe Biden present their "crisis resolution" 
plan during his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin later this month.
Following Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's meeting with US senators in Vilnius on Tuesday, the Belarusian opposition's 
Coordination Council plans to send its proposals for solving the crisis to US leaders, Franak Viacorka, an advisor to 
Belarus' exiled opposition leader, said on Wednesday
"We want President Biden to discuss our position and our proposal on the resolution of the crisis: the key stone of 
our scenario is to conduct free and fair elections," Viacorka told a news conference.
"We emphasize that this is not about geopolitics; we emphasize that before new elections are held, all prisoners 
must be released and violence must end," he added.
Tsikhanouskaya said the US support has never been so strong as now.
"We feel that the US want to help us," she said at the news conference. "So, we'll talk about torture in Belarus, 
about people in prisons, and about 9 million Belarusians being aboard a hijacked plane, which is how we feel now."
The opposition leader said she has recently spoken with Dutch, Estonian and Austrian leaders, US senators, and 
officials from the Polish president's office and the National Security Bureau of Poland.
In June, she is also planning to take part in the EU Foreign Affairs Council's meeting in Luxembourg and the US 
Senate Foreign Affairs Committee's hearings.

"Me and my team, all democratic forces and all Belarusians will continue to do everything we can to make sure that 
these terrible times in our country will come to an end and never happen again," she said.
Belarus' opposition will seek that Alexander Lukashenko's regime be declared as " criminal and terrorist", 
Tsikhanouskaya said.
"We remain in touch with international lawyers who help us prepare documents to launch an international 
investigation of the numerous facts of crimes against humanity committed by the regime," she said.
Tsikhanouskaya said her team welcomes the launch of an international law-enforcement investigation into the 
hijacking of Ryanair's Athens-to-Vilnius flight earlier in May.
The opposition leader said that despite the regime's intensifying crackdown, protests in Belarus will continue, with 
"smart solutions" developed by the ByPol analytical center expected to help coordinate them.
The Russian and US presidents are expected to meet in Geneva on June 16 amid mounting Western pressure on 
Russia and Belarus over respect for human rights and democratic principles.

US sectoral sanctions for Minsk would be more effective – senator in Vilnius (expands)
VILNIUS, Jun 01, BNS – Sectoral sanctions for the Minsk regime would be more effective then restrictions for 
individual persons, says Republican Senator Bonb Portman, currently in Vilnius.
"Sectoral sanctions would be likely more effective," he told a press conference on Tuesday.
Sectoral sanctions should be directed at causing pain for the Lukashenko regime.
"It tends to be products or industry sectors where we would see some impact," he said.
The senator was also accompanied by his democrat counterparts Jeanne Shaheen and Chris Murphy. The US 
politicians met with Lithuanian Foreign Gabrielius Landsbergis and Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya.
The visit comes more than a week after the Minsk regime forced a Ryanair passenger plane en route from Athens 
to Vilnius to divert to and land in Minsk to detain opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia 
Sapega.
The US lawmakers said such action could not be left without a response, adding that the detained duo, as well as 
all other political prisoners in Belarus, must be released.
The politicians also thanked Lithuania for its leadership.
Last Friday, the White House said the United States would impose sanctions for Belarus for its action. The United 
States said it is drafting a list of targeted sanctions for members of the Lukashenko regime in cooperation with the 
European Union.

Meanwhile, Murphy said sanctions should be "strong, impactful and in coordination with allies"
"The US should (...) also send a message to the world that the democratic community, led by the US and the EU 
won't let a brutal dictatorship get away with this kind of persecution of political opponents," he said.
Shaheen said Lukashenko must release all political prisoners and Belarus should hold a democratic election.
"This is the time for you to go, make room for a democratically elected leader, more deserved of your people," the 
senator said, addressing the Belarusian leader.
Also attending the conference, Tsikhanouskaya thanked the US for the sanctions imposed for Belarus so far, 
stressing that need, however, for "further measures against enterprises and persons of the regime".
"The situation is getting worse, repressions against people continue," she said, adding that there are over 450 
political prisoners in Belarus.
On Tuesday, Tadeusz Giczan, editor-in-chief of the Nexta channel, tweeted that the Minsk regime was likely to 
have initially planned to hijack a plane with Tsikhanouskaya onboard as the email account that the email about a 
bomb on the diverted Ryanair plane was sent from was created on May 14 when Tsikhanouskaya was in Greece.
Tsikhanouskaya said on Tuesday she's aware of this information but could not confirm it.
"We don't have evidence," she said.

Lithuania will make every effort to help Belarusian journalists – minister
VILNIUS, Jun 01, BNS – As the Belarusian regime is cracking down on independent Belarusian media, Lithuania 
will make every effort to help journalists from the neighboring county, Lithuanian Culture Minister Simonas Kairys 
says.
He invited Belarusian journalists to meet more than a week after an incident when the Lukashenko regime forced a 
Ryanair plane en route from Athens to Vilnius to land in Minsk to detain dissident Belarusian blogger Raman 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend.
"First of all, my team and I would like to express our support and solidarity. We understand very well that you and 
we are fighting for common values – a free world and a free word. The existing major tensions come from the fact 
that there's a fear of a free word because it is powerful," Kairys said on Tuesday.
"Therefore, Lithuania will make every effort to help Belarusian journalists working in our country. You have the 
same rights and opportunities in our country as Lithuanian journalists do. The Culture Ministry's door is always open 
for you," the minister added.
Belarusian journalists said they feel fairly safe in Lithuania and want to maintain ties with those who stayed in 
Belarus, as well as colleagues who left for other countries, but they also need to stay vigilant, the ministry said.
The journalists also expressed their wish to contribute to the fight against propaganda and disinformation in 
Lithuania, especially in the country's southeastern region where their knowledge of the Belarusian and Russian 
language and professional competence can be beneficial.
Kairys says Lithuania should be ready to receive a large flow of Belarusian journalists and other citizens. The 
Tuesday discussions also touched upon measures that would allow Belarusian media to effectively continue 
working, the ministry said.

Pratasevich's parents vow to turn to court over smear campaign
VILNIUS, Jun 01, BNS – The parents of Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition blogger detained in Minsk, 
are considering turning to court over a smear campaign against their son on Belarusian state television.
Raman's father Dmitry told a remote press conference on Tuesday, held by Lithuanian lawmakers Emanuelis 
Zingeris, Algirdas Sysas and Zygimantas Pavilionis to discuss the situation in Belarus, a wide-scale disinformation 
campaign against his son is being carried out via Belarusian state media channels.
"They are trying to show him as a neo-Nazi, some extremist, terrorist, calling him all sorts of things on state TV 
channels. Naturally, I will not leave that like this and I will turn to court and will seek the truth and for the person who 
said that to prove that. If he fails to prove that, he will face a tough punishment. I am sure of that. We, as parents, 
will not leave that like this," he said.
Raman's mother Natalia said Belarusian journalist Grigory Azaryonok is one of the people spreading disinformation.
"Raman is a smart and talented young man but everything has now been replaced by some nightmare – terrorism. 
What terrorism? Azaryonok is calling him a freak and Nazi on his TV channel. It's unbearable. I am asking the 
whole global community to help my Raman, to help Sofia, his girlfriend, help all young people who are behind bars, 
who are being tortured," the woman said.
Neither the parents, nor the lawyer have so far been able to contact Raman.
His parents also tanked Lithuania and other Western countries for their support and strong reaction, and hope for 
change.

Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega were detained in Minsk on May 23 after the Belarusian regime 
forced a Ryanair passenger plane to divert and land in Minsk, sparking outrage in the West and calls for tougher 
sanctions for the Minsk regime.
Pre-trial investigations into the incident are ongoing in Lithuania, Poland and the United States.

Lithuanian finmin calls on World Bank to suspend operation in Belarus
VILNIUS, Jun 01, BNS – Lithuanian Finance Minister Gintare Skaiste has on Tuesday called on the World Bank to 
review its involvement in Belarus and suspend its operation in the country after Belarus forced a Ryanair passenger 
plane to divert and land in Minsk on May 23.
"In the context of the recent events, I am urging the World Bank to take strong measures against the Belarusian 
regime and not to launch new projects in the country and suspend the ongoing ones. We see risks that further 
implementation of projects can be beneficial for the regime. It is raising reputational risks for the institution itself. 
The international community, including international financial institutions, should send a clear and united response 
to the Belarusian regime," the minister was quoted as saying in a released statement.
On Tuesday, Skaiste discussed the issue with the World Bank's representatives for the Nordic and Baltic states, the 
World Bank's President David Malpass and Lene Lind, the World Bank's incoming executive director for the Nordic 
and Baltic states.
The World Bank Group's organizatons are carrying out 23 projects in Belarus.

Estonian formin meets with Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya
TALLINN, May 31, BNS - Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Eva-Maria Liimets met on Monday with Belarusian 
opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in Estonia and expressed support to the democratic aspirations of the 
Belarusian people and Tsikhanouskaya's activities in consistently raising the issue of the developments in Belarus.
Topics discussed at the meeting included the situation in Belarus and Estonia's activities aimed at keeping the 
focus of international organizations on these developments.
"Severe human rights violations aggravating in Belarus is extremely alarming. Estonia will definitely keep drawing 
the focus on this topic at both bilateral meetings as well as in international relations in order to support the people of 
Belarus in their pursuit of ensuring democracy and human rights," Liimets said.
Liimets and Tsikhanouskaya discussed at length the Belarusian authorities forcing a Ryanair passenger plane to 
land in Minsk in order to arrest an opposition journalist traveling aboard the aircraft. Liimets said that following the 
said incident, Estonia immediately launched consultations with its allies and also raised the issue in the UN Security 
Council on May 26.
"Estonia strongly condemns the forced landing of the Ryanair plane in Minsk, which jeopardized the passengers 
and crew aboard the aircraft, and demands that Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega be released immediately," 
the Estonian foreign minister said.
Liimets and Tsikhanouskaya previously met via a video link before the Day of Solidarity with Belarus in February.

Lithuania's Nauseda on Putin, Lukashenko's meeting: Belarus depends on Russia
VILNIUS, May 31, BNS – Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's 
recent meeting once again proved that Belarus depends on Russia, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda says, 
adding that he expects swift decisions on sectoral sanctions for Belarus.
"This only once again clearly shows how much Belarus depends on Russia and how many ties it has, and even if 
the Belarusian dictator sometime speaks about some kind of independence defense or some independence in one 
or another area, we should not be fooled by this as we need to understand very clearly that this state is dependent 
on Russia in all respects and we should not even have the slightest illusion about that," Nauseda told journalists on 
Monday.
"We need to prevent the Belarusian dictator by all possible civilized means from the action we have recently faced, 
and the best way to do that is to raise the price of such action to the maximum for such action to be expensive and 
painful. There's just no other way to change the behavior model," he added.
Decisions on sectoral sanctions for Belarus can be expected soon, the Lithuanian leader said.
"I would like to express my delight over the swift and determined decision the European Council maid some time 
ago when it responded, practically over the course of 40 hours, to what happened in Belarus. I do believe this 
determination and very clear understanding of the threat has gone through the whole EU institutional hierarchy. 
Therefore, decision can be expected shortly," the Lithuanian leader said.
On May 23, a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian 
airspace and was diverted to Minsk where it landed. Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the

In response to this incident, EU leaders later banned Belarusian airlines from flying into the block and urged EU 
airlines to avoid the Belarusian airspace. The EU is also considering introducing sectoral sanctions to step up 
pressure on Belarus.

EU's Breton: Lithuanian firms can produce COVID-19 vaccines
VILNIUS, May 31, BNS – Lithuanian companies are capable of producing not only COVID-19 vaccine components, 
but also vaccines, European Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said in Vilnius on Monday.
"It's not for me to recommend to the companies their strategy. But [after] visiting the factory, interacting with the 
management, visiting production lines, I'm really impressed with the quality of the key components that are needed 
for mRNA [vaccines]," Breton said after visiting Thermo Fisher Scientific Baltics and other companies that have 
ambitions to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Of course, it's not my decision. But if you are asking me, if I believe that the team which is managing this facility [...] 
have the ability to go further and to manufacture the vaccine. My answer after visiting them this morning would be 
yes," he said.
The commissioner said he had assured Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte that Lithuania would be part of the EU's 
autonomous vaccine supply chain.
In Vilnius, Breton also met with several passengers of Ryanair's Athens-to-Vilnius flight that was forced to land in 
Minsk on May 23 in what the commissioner described as "a hijacking of the European values".
"We are European, but today we all feel Lithuanian. We are part of that. It has been a hijacking of European values. 
And this will not be tolerated," he told the news conference.
Lithuanian biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are already supplying components to vaccine developers 
around the world. Some of them are planning to expand production capacity.
In early May, Economy and Innovation Minister Ausrine Armonaite discussed possibilities to produce COVID-19 
vaccines in Lithuania with Vladas Algirdas Bumelis, board chairman at Northway Biotech.
EU's Breton: Lithuanian firms can produce COVID-19 vaccines
Bumelis said the company could start producing the active substance of vaccines in a year, at the earliest, after 
concluding contracts with vaccine manufacturers.
Northway Biotech could produce the active substance for the AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, according to 
Bumelis.
Currently, Vilnius-based Thermo Fisher Scientific Baltics manufactures components used in the production of 
coronavirus vaccines.

Lithuania gets in global media spotlight due to Minsk incident – govt group
VILNIUS, May 28, BNS – Lithuania has found itself in the limelight of global media over the past four days following 
Sunday's incident when a passenger plane en route to Vilnius was diverted and forced to land in Minsk, Marius 
Gurskas, head of the government's group in charge of the country's image.
"We have made a search using Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew and Japanese characters based on keywords, like 
"Lithuania", "Ryanair" and "Minsk", plus out top leaders. That wide base included over 380,000 sources. Over the 
past four days, we have had over 7,000 cases where these keywords were used and our leaders were cited," 
Gurskas told the national radio LRT.
In his words, in the first quarter, Lithuania was mentioned around 19,000 times in total.
According to the Government Chancellery, Lithuania has been mentioned in around 110 different countries and 
information about the Minsk incident has been produced in 30 languages, with the largest number of references 
recorded in the United States, the UK, Germany, Canada, Australia and Spain.
Last Sunday, a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian 
airspace and was diverted to Minsk where it landed. Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the 
Nexta information channel Raman Pratasevich was detained after the plane landed in Minsk, alongside his girlfriend 
Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen and student of the Vilnius-based European Humanities University.

Lithuanian law enforcement want more effective cooperation with Ryanair
VILNIUS, May 28, BNS – Lithuanian officers expect more effective cooperation with Ryanair as part of the ongoing 
investigation into the recent forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk, Rolandas Kiskis, chief of Lithuania's 
Criminal Police Bureau, says.
"Cooperation is ongoing but, to be honest, we and the prosecution service believe it could be faster and more 
effective," he told a press conference on Friday. "We would like more effective cooperation with colleagues from 
Ryanair."
Later asked about the airline's role in deciding to divert the plane and land in Minsk, Kiskis said that Ryanair is yet 
to produce answers, adding, however, that "that will not happen fast".
"We are waiting for Ryanair's official confirmation and answers, and they are also carrying out their own internal 
investigation, (…) that will not happen fast. The matter is sensitive, therefore, we want to have a 100-percent 
answer on what happened," the officer said.
During the press conference, Kiskis and Gintas Ivanauskas, a deputy prosecutor general, also informed about the 
ongoing process aimed at merging the ongoing investigations in Lithuania and Poland, and also said the FBI had 
also launched its own probe.
Last Sunday, a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian 
airspace and was diverted to Minsk where it landed. Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the 
Nexta information channel Raman Pratasevich was detained after the plane landed in Minsk, alongside his girlfriend 
Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen and student of the Vilnius-based European Humanities University.

VILNIUS, May 28, BNS – Lithuania is ready to host the 2021 UEC European Track Championships which was 
supposed to be held in Minsk, Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte says.
"Lithuania is ready to host the 2021 Elite Track European Championships. Infrastructure, experience, friendly fans 
& financial contribution – this is our pledge to @UEC_cycling & the athletes of 50 #cycling federations. Nobody 
can’t stop the bike (sic)," Simonyte tweeted on Thursday.
Lithuania could host the event in its northern city of Panevezy's Cido Arena.
The 2021 UEC European Track Championships was supposed to be held in Minsk but was cancelled on Thursday 
in response to the forced landing of a passenger plane by the Belarusian regime to detain several opposition 
members.

Belarussian prosecutor general opens criminal case against Stakis and Rinkevics
MINSK, May 28, BNS/INTERFAX - Belarusian Prosecutor General Andrey Shved has opened a criminal case 
against Riga Mayor Martins Stakis (For/Progressives) and Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) 
for replacing a Belarusian state flag with Belarus' historical white-red-white standard in Riga.
After reviewing the information available in mass media and on the Internet "about the grave crime committed 
against Belarus' interests", the prosecutor general opened a criminal case against Stakis and Rinkevics. They are 
accused of deliberate actions aimed at instigating racial strife on grounds of national affiliation, the Belarusian 
Prosecutor General's Office said.
"The criminal actions involved the public removal and replacement of the Belarusian state flag, which had been 
hoisted in the center of Riga due to the Belarusian team participating in the ice hockey world championship, with a 
white-red-white canvas," the Prosecutor General's Office said in a statement.
"This desecration of the state symbol humiliated the national dignity of the Belarusians," the statement says.
The criminal case has been forwarded to the Investigative Committee for a preliminary inquiry.
As reported, responding to the incident in which a Ryanair passenger plane was forced to land in Minsk so that 
Belarusian authorities could arrest opposition journalist Raman Pratasevich, Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars 
Rinkevics and Riga Mayor Martins Stakis replaced Belarus' official flag with the white-red-white standard at the 
Radisson Blu Hotel Latvija where the Belarussian national ice hockey team is accommodated during the ice hockey 
world championship.

Latvian Ambassador to Belarus Einars Semanis was therefore on Monday summoned to the Belarusian Foreign

Responding to Belarus' decision, the Latvian Foreign Ministry summoned Belarus' charge d' affaires to inform that 
Belarusian diplomats are being expelled until relations between the two countries are normalized.

Lithuanian, Polish law enforcement, FBI investigate forced plane landing in Minsk (expands)
VILNIUS, May 28, BNS – Lithuanian and Polish law enforcement, as well as the United States' Federal Bureau of 
Investigation are investigating the recent forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk, Rolandas, Kiskis, head of the 
Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau, says.
"Besides the pre-trial investigation launched in the Republic of Poland, we also have information from US 
colleagues that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has also started its one investigation. We are also in active 
cooperation with colleagues from Ireland and Greece. It is happening everyday, 24/7," Kiskis told journalists on 
Friday.
In his words, all crew members of the Ryanair plane and "around 90 percent of all passengers" jave been 
questioned.
Gintas Ivanauskas, a deputy prosecutor general, says the Ryanair plane is still at Vilnius Airport since not all action 
planned as part of the ongoing investigation has been made. Once it is done, the plane will be able to leave. 
Additional plane inspection is planned over the next several days.
According to Ivanauskas, a joint investigation team is now being formed with Polish prosecutors as the country is 
also carrying out a pre-trial investigation into the incident since the plane is registered in Poland.
Kiskis says the FBI launched its own investigation probably in response to information that American citizens were 
among passengers on the plane.
"Naturally, since they probably have information that their citizens were among the passengers, the country makes 
its own decision on whether to launch an investigation or not," he said.

The Criminal Police Bureau chief said Vilnius Airport received an alleged letter on a bomb placed on the plane but 
that information was later found not to be true.
"They received the letter, but I cannot say when. We are checking and verifying the information," Kiskis said.
In his words, a response from Belarus was also received via the Interpol channel on Thursday. "It is very short and 
says that the plane landed in Minsk and that five passengers were taken off the plane and stayed in Minsk, 
including Raman Pratasevich who is under pre-trial investigation and was detained as part of a pre-trial 
investigation being carried out by Belarusian law enforcement," Kiskis said.
Both Ivanauskas and Kiskis confirmed that a legal assistance request will be sent to Belarus over the upcoming 
days.
Last Sunday, a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian 
airspace and was diverted to Minsk where it landed. Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the

Tsikhanouskaya's office estimates EU, other aid to democratic Belarus at USD 10 b
VILNIUS, May 28, BNS – The European Commission's plan of support to a future democratic Belarus and aid from 
other organizations and countries may amount up to 10 billion US dollars, the office of Belarus' exiled opposition 
leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Friday.
According to Valery Kavaleuski, the head of her cabinet, the plan presented by European Commission President 
Ursula von der Leyen to Tsikhanouskaya and other leaders of Belarus' pro-democracy movement in a letter on 
Friday should be activated "once Belarus embarks on a democratic transition"
"What the European Commission offers is 3 billion euros in support," Kavaleuski told an online news conference. 
"We estimate that with the participation of other interested players – countries and international organizations – this 
support package would increase to 10 billion US dollars."
Von der Leyen said that the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minks to arrest of Belarusian opposition activist 
Raman Pratasevich had given the EU an "impetus to act, he said.
Kavaleuski also noted that at least two jailed opposition activists had died in Belarus and several free media 
channels, including Tut.by, had been closed recently.
Ales Aliakhnovich, Tsikhanouskaya's representative for economics, said that the 3-billion-euro package, a mix of 
grants and soft loans, would be allocated to Belarus "only after free, democratic elections."
He described the package as the EU's promised basic support that would be disbursed in the first two to three 
years of implementation of fundamental reforms, adding that the country could expect more aid from the bloc while 
advancing further on the path to democracy.

A "rather large amount" of money could also come from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the 
International Finance Corporation, which is part of the World Bank Group, as well as from some countries, such as 
the United Kingdom, Norway, Canada and the United States, according to Aliakhnovich.

Estonian president urges stopping 'flow of money' to Lukashenko
Tallinn, May 28, AFP-BNS - Estonia on Friday called for stopping the "flow of money" to Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko, who is facing a global outcry after the arrest of a dissident journalist on a diverted flight.
"The situation in Belarus is urgent because there are journalists who were probably tortured," Estonian President 
Kersti Kaljulaid told reporters.
"There's a certain urgency to take action, it is important to cut the flow of money," she added, a day after Estonia 
banned Belarusian flights from using its airspace.
The European Union has already promised a fresh wave of sanctions against Lukashenko and regime officials and 
urged carriers based in the bloc to divert flights from Belarusian airspace.
The opposition journalist Raman Pratasevich, who was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, was last 
seen looking nervous in a video released by Belarusian authorities on Monday.
His parents said he looked like he had been beaten.
Kaljulaid said of the sanctions that "the Europeans want to act within a legal framework. It's difficult, it takes time, 
but it's not impossible."
She said she hopes the next sanctions against Lukashenko will be stronger and concern his resources.
"I think it's better to attack the resources of authoritarian regimes. They aren't located there but in larger countries, 
notably of course in the United Kingdom," Kaljulaid said.
"If we really want to make a difference, we have to limit the investment possibilities," she added.
Estonian president urges stopping 'flow of money' to Lukashenko
Lukashenko sparked international outrage by dispatching a fighter jet Sunday to intercept a Ryanair flight from 
Athens to Vilnius carrying Pratasevich, 26, and Sapega, 23.
A defiant Lukashenko said he had "acted lawfully to protect our people" from an alleged bomb threat on the plane, 
in a parliament address Wednesday.
Lukashenko is facing some of the strongest international pressure of his nearly 27 years ruling  Belarus. The 66-
year-old has retained his grip on power by hounding opponents, jailing and allegedly torturing dissidents, and 
muzzling independent media.
He and his allies are already under a series of Western sanctions over a crackdown on protests after his disputed 
re-election to a sixth term last August.

Lukashenko won't stop, EU, NATO must swiftly respond – Lithuanian defmin
VILNIUS, May 28, BNS – Lithuanian National Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas has urged allies to remain 
vigilant as Belarus will continue acting aggressively, the National Defense Ministry said on Friday.
The minister said that during an informal meeting of EU defense ministers with NATO Secretary General Jens 
Stoltenberg in Lisbon.
"The situation around us is worsening. Lukashenko won't stop and his goal is clear as he wants to destroy 
democracy and undermine the values we are fighting for. Therefore, our response must be coordinated. NATO and 
the EU must find a way to swiftly respond to such attacks," Anusauskas was quoted as saying in the ministry's 
press release.
Belarus was the main focus of ministers' statements, the ministry noted. Anusauskas called the recent plane 
hijacking as an act of state terrorism, and his Latvian counterpart Artis Pabriks urged the EU "to act as a union with 
values is supposed to act".
Last Sunday, a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian 
airspace and was diverted to Minsk where it landed. Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the 
Nexta information channel Raman Pratasevich was detained after the plane landed in Minsk, alongside his girlfriend

Lithuania expels two staff members of Belarusian embassy in Vilnius
VILNIUS, May 28, BNS - Lithuania has decided to expel two members of Belarus' embassy staff in Vilnius, 
indicating among other things that the measure is a gesture of solidarity with Latvia, the Foreign Ministry said on 
Friday.
A representative of Belarus' embassy was summoned to the ministry on Friday and handed a note declaring the 
two staff members persona non grata for "their activity incompatible with the diplomatic status" and giving them 
seven days to leave Lithuania.
The move is also a gesture of solidarity with Latvia whose embassy staff were ordered to leave Belarus "without 
justification" several days ago, the ministry said in a statement.
The ministry also voiced "its protest to the representative of Belarus over the ongoing repression of civil society and 
independent media in Belarus and demanded an immediate release of Raman Pratasevich, his friend Sofia 
Sapega, other political prisoners and illegally detained persons".
Pratasevich, an opposition activist and blogger, and Sapega, a Russian citizen and student of Vilnius-based 
European Humanities University, were arrested last Sunday after their Vilnius-bound flight from Athens was forced 
to change course just before crossing into Lithuanian airspace and land in Minsk.
In response to the incident, EU leaders have agreed to ban Belarusian airlines from the bloc's airspace and called 
on EU-based air carriers to avoid Belarus' airspace. The EU is considering sectoral sanctions against the country to

ICAO probe results can be expected in a month – Lithuanian minister
VILNIUS, May 28, BNS – As the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) plans to carry out an investigation 
into the recent forced landing of a passenger plane in Belarus, Lithuania's transport minister says the probe's 
conclusions can be expected in around a month.
Marius Skuodis also told the national television LRT that the recent incident created a precedent after which many 
passengers might need to inquire over which country their plane would fly.
There was no unanimous backing for an ICAO investigation but the majority of the organization's member agreed 
that it was necessary.
"The investigation will be carried out by the organization, in cooperation with all members involved, first of all, 
Belarus where the incident took place, and also Poland as that specific Ryanair plane is registered there, and also 
Ireland, because Ryanair is an Irish company, and Lithuania because it flew to Lithuania. We can expect to have 
the results in around a month," Skuodis said.
The Transport Ministry said on Thursday night that the ICAO plans to carry out an investigation into the 
aforementioned incident of May 23 when a Ryanair plane with 126 passengers en route from Athens to Vilnius was 
forced to land in Minsk. During an extraordinary ICAO meeting on Thursday, Skuodis once again called for an in-
depth and independent investigation.
He also asked for the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to be involved in the investigation as the 
incident is related to an EU airline. The EASA has already issued a Safety Information Bulletin telling flight operator 
to avoid the Belarusian airspace unless it was necessary due to unforeseen circumstances.
A number of European airlines, including SAS, airBaltic, Wizz Air, Air France, Lufthansa and Finnair, have already 
decided to avoid the Belarusian airspace.

Belarusian airline companies forbidden from flying over, landing in Estonia
TALLINN, May 28, BNS – The government has decided to prohibit Belarusian airlines or aircraft departing from that 
country from landing on Estonian territory, taking off from Estonia or flying over the country's airspace.
Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that the actions of Belarus pose a threat to international peace and security.
"With the hijacking of a passenger plane flying between Athens and Vilnius and the arrest of a journalist critical of 
the government and his companion, the Belarusian regime has committed an act of state terrorism and must be 
held accountable for its actions," Kallas said according to spokespeople for the government.
Kallas added that the European Union is continuing preparations for the swift imposition of additional sanctions on 
Belarusian officials and companies closely linked to the regime and will set forth economic sanctions.
The government sanction concerning the flight ban is imposed in connection with the forced diversion of a Ryanair 
passenger jet by Belarus to Minsk on May 23. A Belarusian military aircraft, MIG-29, and a bomb threat were used 
to force the passenger plane, which was en route from Athens to Vilnius and was carrying more than 100 
passengers from 17 countries, including EU member states, to land. After the plane had landed in Minsk, the 
Belarus authorities detained Raman Pratasevich, an independent Belarusian journalist and co-creator of the 
Telegram channel NEXTA, who was on board the flight, as well as his companion.
At its special meeting on May 24, the European Council, in addition to calling for the imposition of economic 
sanctions, urged all national airlines to avoid flying over Belarus. Leaders of the member states also called on the 
EU Council to adopt measures necessary to impose an overflight ban on Belarusian air carriers in the EU airspace 
and to prevent flights operated by these airlines from landing at EU airports.

Some of Ryanair's questions to Belarus 'make you gasp' – Lithuanian minister
VILNIUS, May 27, BNS – Some of Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary's questions to Belarus' authorities about Sunday's 
forced landing of the airline's flight in Minsk are "very interesting and even make you gasp", Lithuanian Transport 
Minister Marius Skuodis said on Thursday.
"We keep getting explanations every day. I myself have seen some very interesting questions by Ryanair's CEO 
which really make you gasp," Skuodis told LRT Radio.
"Ryanair is putting a lot of questions to the responsible authorities, [such as] if there was an explosive on the plane, 
why it was instructed to land in Minsk Airport, near the passenger terminal, rather than in a remote location," he 
said.
Ryanair is also asking, among other things, why the flight's passengers were not urgently evacuated, why their 
luggage was only checked by sniffer dogs, rather than by special equipment, and why the crew and passengers 
were not given any answers for six hours, according to the minister.
On Thursday, Skuodis will discuss the Ryanair flight incident with the United Nations International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO).
"There're a lot of specific details here. We'll see what the organization answers. Various actions are possible," the 
minister told the radio station.
"In this case, the most important thing for us is that an international investigation [is conducted] and all answers are 
answered, including about the whereabouts of the five passengers," he said. "We know that two of them have been 
jailed, even though they flew legally between two EU member states."
Some of Ryanair 's questions to Belarus 'make you gasp' – Lithuanian minister
The Ryanair flight, scheduled to arrive in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, was forced to change course just before 
crossing into Lithuanian airspace.
According to the Irish airline, the flight with more than 100 passengers aboard made an emergency landing in Minsk 
after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers of "a potential security threat on board", but "nothing untoward" 
was found.
Five of the passengers who boarded the flight in the Greek capital did not arrive in Vilnius after the aircraft was 
allowed to continue its journey to the Lithuanian capital.
Two of the passengers, Belarusian opposition activist and blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia 
Sapega, a Russian citizen and student of Vilnius-based European Humanities University, were arrested after their 
flight landed in Belarus' capital.

UNSC holds discussion on developments in Belarus at Estonia's initiative
TALLINN, May 27, BNS - The UN Security Council discussed on Wednesday at Estonia's initiative the Belarusian 
authorities being accused of forcing to land a European passenger plane and arresting Belarusian journalist and 
opposition activist Raman Pratasevich.
"We ended the last Security Council informal briefing on Belarus with a hope that grave human rights violations in 
Belarus will end soon. Unfortunately, the situation has not improved, on the contrary -- it has aggravated. The 
regime in Belarus is trampling on human rights of its citizens with growing cruelty. The number of political prisoners 
in Belarus has reached record-high, exceeding 400. The hijacking of a plane is yet another escalation in the 
crackdown of dissenting voices. It constitutes a new and extremely dangerous phase in the Belarusian authorities' 
campaign of repression against its own people. It is a clear example how the grave human rights violations often 
lead to serious international security threats," Estonian Ambassador to the UN Sven Jurgenson said.
Jurgenson said that Estonia strongly condemns the forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk and the detention of 
Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega by Belarusian authorities.
"This act is an attack against international civilian aviation safety, in clear violation with the international law and 
poses a threat to international peace and security," he added. "Today's closed discussion showed that most 
members of the Security Council are deeply concerned about the activities of the Belarusian authorities and 
demand an international investigation."
After the meeting, a joint statement by Estonia, France, Ireland, Norway, the United States, the United Kingdom, 
Germany and Belgium was read out by Jurgenson.

Pratasevich's mother pleads for West's help to free her son, other political prisoners  - BNS SPECIAL
VILNIUS, May 27, BNS – Natalia Pratasevich, the mother of Belarusian opposition journalist Raman Pratasevich, is 
pleading for the West to help free her son and other political prisoners held by Alexander Lukashenko's regime.
"I'm just asking for help, for the media to cover all this correctly so that people, presidents hear about this 
arbitrariness [and] persuade citizen Lukashenko to release my son," she told BNS by phone on Thursday.
The woman also called for refraining from any violence and for the issue to be resolved through diplomatic 
channels.
"I'm not calling for violence, I'm not calling for war," she said. "I'm asking for peace, kindness, honesty and justice. 
I'm asking the West for help in persuading that man to release my son and other political prisoners like him."
Pratasevich said she had no information about her son's health because even his lawyer had not been allowed to 
see him.
"Unfortunately, we know nothing. All we have from the lawyer is that the request has been rejected without giving a 
reason," she said. "No, we aren't in Belarus and we can't see [him], but even those who are there can't either. Not in 
that state. The laws aren't working there."
The woman believes that the regime arrested her son "because he spoke the truth."
"He spoke the truth about the current government, about what's happening in our republic, about how the elections 
took place, [and] about how the people spoke out for democracy [and] freedom of speech," she said. "That's why 
my son suffered; that's why he became Lukashenko's enemy number one."
Pratasevich's mother pleads for West's help to free her son, other political prisoners - BNS SPECIAL
Pratasevich dismissed as "complete nonsense" Lukashenko's claim that her son had been a mercenary who fought 
in eastern Ukraine.
"As we've already said, this is complete nonsense," she said. "Our son is a journalist and he covered the events in 
Ukraine as a journalist. He worked as a professional journalist."
Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen and student of Vilnius-based European 
Humanities University, were arrested on Sunday after their Vilnius-bound flight from Athens was forced to change 
course just before crossing into Lithuanian airspace and land in Minsk.
Ryanair has said the flight with more than 100 passengers aboard made an emergency landing in Minsk after being 
notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers of "a potential security threat on board", but "nothing untoward" was found.
Belarus scrambled a MiG-29 jet fighter and a Mi-24 military helicopter for the operation.
In his address to the parliament on Wednesday, Lukashenko called the couple "an extremist and his accomplice" 
and said that his country had "the sovereign right" to detain its citizen and his girlfriend who has a residence permit 
in Belarus.
Belarus' authorities have released a video of Pratasevich confessing to having organized mass unrest, but his 
parents, Belarus' opposition and the West believe that the "confession " was obtained under duress.

Pratasevich's friend Pucila asks West to step up pressure on Belarusian regime
VILNIUS, May 27, BNS - Sciapan Pucila, a co-founder of the Nexta information channel and a friend of Raman 
Pratasevich, an opposition blogger who was recently detained in Minsk, has asked the West to step up pressure on 
the Belarusian regime by imposing specific sanctions.
He told a press conference from Poland on Thursday, also attended by Pratasevich's parents, he has no doubt 
Pratasevich is being tortured and banned from meeting with anyone, and there are daily reports about the detention 
of and issuance of long prison sentences to new opposition figures, closures of the last free media channels, and 
also people face one-month arrest for wearing white-and-red flags or masks.
"We are asking for the international community's assistance in ensuring our security. But first of all, we are asking 
the world to help Belarus, and that can only be done by stepping up pressure on the regime, i.e., by tightening the 
sanctions which have failed over the past eight months to affect the regime, therefore, it resolved to take such 
action," Pucila said.
In his words, the Belarusian regime must be declared "terrorist" and any "economic, political, diplomatic, transport" 
cooperation with it needs to be terminated, including the airspace restrictions for Belarusian airlines now under 
consideration. Pucila also called for blocking Belarus in the international banking system SWIFT as it would "really 
force the regime to think".
"Only unprecedented international pressure is capable of affecting the regime, capable of stopping the repressions, 
capable of saving innocent lives," he said.

airspace and was diverted to Minsk where it landed. Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the

Last year, Belarus put Pratasevich, 26, and Sciapan Pucila, 22, a co-founder of the Nexta channel, on the list of 
persons engaged in terrorist activity and also declared the channel to be extremist and ordered to block it.

Belavia flight crossed Latvian airspace en route to Tallinn on Thursday
RIGA, May 27, BNS - A Minsk-Tallinn flight of Belarus' Belavia carrier on Thursday crossed Latvian airspace 
despite the Latvian government's decision to ban Belarusian airlines from using Latvian airspace, Latvijas Gaisa 
Satiksme (LGS) air navigation services provider informed BNS.
The Civil Aviation Agency's (CAA) representative Aivis Vincevs told BNS that the CAA on Thursday updated an 
earlier aeronavigation information notification, prohibiting aircraft of Belarus-registered carriers from using Latvian 
airspace for flights also to destinations outside Latvia.
Vincevs said that the notification has been posted on the aeronavigation information website and has already come 
into effect. This means that from now on, aircraft of  Belarus-registered carriers will be prohibited not only to fly to 
Latvian airports but also to use Latvian airspace for transit flights.
Belarus-registered carriers can only use Latvian airspace in emergencies.
On Tuesday evening, the government imposed restrictions on air carriers registered in Belarus on the issuing of 
flight permits and thus enter Latvian airspace and use Latvian airports.
The use of Belarusian airspace and airports by Latvian aircraft has also been restricted. The decision took effect 
immediately.
Such decisions were made at the government meeting in response to the actions of the Belarussian authorities, 
intercepting and forcibly landing a civilian passenger aircraft of the European Union airline Ryanair at Minsk Airport, 
evaluating the information available made available by aviation safety authorities and responding to the initiative of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The government decision also stipulates that Latvian airports will not service aircraft of other countries that use 
Belarusian airspace on their flight route.
This means that the Ministry of Transport will suspend the flight permit for the Belarusian airline Belavia and will not 
issue non-scheduled flight permits to Belarusian carriers. The airBaltic route permit to Minsk has also been 
suspended.
The Civil Aviation Agency (CAA) has carried out a risk assessment of Belarusian airspace and has identified it as 
unsafe for civil aircraft operations.
Latvian carriers are advised not to use Belarusian airspace.

Russia's Aeroflot cancels Friday's flight to Vilnius
VILNIUS, May 27, BNS – As a growing number of European countries are banning Belarusian airlines from entering 
their airspace and Lithuania has banned all flights for and from Belarus, Russian airline Aeroflot has cancelled its 
Friday flight from Moscow to Vilnius, Tadas Vasiliauskas, spokesman for Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), 
the operator of Lithuania's three airports, has confirmed it to BNS.

yet, the airline has not informed us," he said.
The plane was scheduled to land in Vilnius at 6 p.m. The flight from Vilnius to Moscow, scheduled for the same day, 
will not take place as well.
On Monday, the Lithuanian government banned airlines from flying to and from Lithuania via the Belarusian

Vilnius to divert and land in Minsk and detained an opposition blogger onboard that plane.
Later, EU leader agreed to ban Belarusian airlines from entering the block's airpsace and urged EU airlines not to 
fly over Belarus.

Europe must be ready for Belarusian regime's further escalation – Lithuania's Landsbergis
VILNIUS, Mar 26, BNS – Authoritarian Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko is threatening Europe with drugs 
and illegal immigrants, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis  says, adding that it amounts to the 
regime's further escalation.
"Lukashenko is openly threatening to send drugs and illegal immigrants our way. Terrorist is what terrorist does or 
intends to do. That is a further escalation by the regime that Europe needs to be ready for," the minister tweeted on 
Wednesday in response to Lukashenko's Wednesday speech in thre country's parliament.
"We have been putting a stop to drugs and migrants, but now you will have to catch them yourselves," the 
Telegram channel of the Belarusian state television and radio company's TV news agency quoted Lukashenko as 
saying in parliament on Wednesday.
He also stated that "attacks" on his country "have crossed the red lines" amid international outrage over the recent 
forced landing of a Ryanair plane in Minsk and detention of a dissident activist.
Lukashenko says he acted lawfully in the Ryanair plane situation. He also said the claim that a MiG-29 fighter jet 
forced the passenger plane to land was completely untrue.
Last Sunday, a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian 
airspace and was diverted to Minsk where it landed.
The airline said the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers 
of "a potential security threat on board" but "nothing untoward was found".
Belarus also scrambled a fighter jet and a military helicopter.

Lithuania's Freedom Party group holds pro-opposition rally outside Belarusian Embassy
VILNIUS, May 26, BNS – Members of the Freedom Party's political group in the Lithuanian parliament held a rally in 
support of the Belarusian opposition outside the Belarusian Embassy in Vilnius on Tuesday night in response to the 
recent forced landing of a Ryanair passenger plane in Minsk.
The rally was attended by around 50 people.
Participants sang songs and chanted "Long Live Belarus!", "Thank You, Lithuania" and held banners with photos of 
political prisoners and inscriptions "We call for release of Raman Pratasevich and other political prisoners", "Free 
Elections Now!", "Lukashenko – Sick Scum". The majority of the people were of younger age.
"Everything is accumulating. We continue to demand a free and independent election. The demand to release 
political prisoners is also in force. Two new names appeared on their list on Sunday," Marius Matijosaitis, a member 
of the Freedom Party group, said.
Last Sunday, a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian 
airspace and was diverted to Minsk where it landed. Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the 
Nexta information channel Raman Pratasevich was detained after the plane landed in Minsk, alongside his girlfriend 
Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen and student of the Vilnius-based European Humanities University.
The Tuesday protest was also attended by Belarusian Uliyana, 37, who fled Minsk in December.
"Today, it's very difficult for people who openly express their opinion and do not support the incumbent leader to live 
in Belarus. I am now wearing my white-and-red-colored sneakers. If I wore them in Belarus, I would probably get a 
fine of around 1,000 euros. That’s the attitude to you liking the colors of your country's historic flag," the woman 
said.

Nikolay, 38, said he attended the rally to support all Belarusians fighting for freedom, especially Pratasevich.
"They are fighting for us. Freedom for them and all political prisoners. The regime must leave, it cannot be 
otherwise. Lukashenko is weak now. He himself no longer believes he will remain. Although I have never wished 
death for someone, I wish it for him, and other Belarusians also wish him the very worst," the man said.

Lukashenko didn't expect EU leaders to show such unity – Lithuanian president's aide
VILNIUS, May 26, BNS – Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko did not expect such a united and 
decisive response from EU leaders to Sunday's forced diversion of a passenger flight to arrest an opposition 
journalist, a spokesman for President Gitanas Nauseda said on Wednesday.
"Lukashenko didn't say anything new; he only repeated his usual narrative of 'besieged Belarus'," Ridas Jasiulionis 
told BNS.
"What's new is that he clearly didn't expect EU leaders to be so united and take decisions so swiftly in response to 
the forced landing of the passenger plane in Minsk," he said.
"Obviously, the regime feels insecure in the face of a consolidated EU and global response," he added.
Earlier on Wednesday, Lukashenko told the parliament that "attacks" against Belarus had crossed "red lines".
"We were stopping migrants and drugs – now you will catch them and eat them yourselves," he said.
"I acted lawfully to protect our people," Lukashenko said, dismissing the international outcry over Sunday's forced 
landing of Ryanair's Athens-Vilnius flight in Minsk and the arrest of opposition activist and blogger Raman 
Pratasevich.

Lithuania would feel short-term effect from potential Belarusian sanctions – experts (media)
VILNIUS, May 26, BNS – Frozen or cut off economic ties with Belarus would have a much more painful affect on 
this country than on Lithuania as the impact on the latter would be short-lived and would not affect all areas, 
economists say.
"With this action, Belarus would lose very much, compared to any gains. The losses, first of all, would include 
travelling, and there are already sanctions on flights already. The second and the most important things is that if we 
want to put pressure on Belarus, we need to review its export of oil products specifically," Marius Dubnikovas, a 
financial analysts and vice president of the Lithuanian Business Confederation, told the lrt.lt news website.
"This country imports oil very cheaply, refines it and exports to Western Europe. If the latter rejected that, that 
regime would really go bust," he said.
Exports important for Belarus go via Lithuania as other export routes would be too expensive for Belarus. But if 
those are halted, some Lithuanian companies would also suffer as Lithuania import raw materials, including metals 
and wood, from Belarus.
Statistics show that Belarus comes 13th in terms of imports for Lithuania and 11th in terms of export volumes. 
Lithuania transports goods produced and reloaded in Europe to Russia via Belarus.
Last Sunday, a Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian

The meeting is being hold by Portugal which now holds the rotating EU presidency. The meeting will also focus on 
frozen conflicts in the Eastern Partnership region. Ministers will discuss the EU's further involvement in pursuit of 
long-term and sustainable solutions.
"All eyes are on Belarus recently but we cannot not to see Russia's destructive role in the Eastern neighborhood 
and in all frozen conflicts in the region. Although Russia positions itself as a mediator, it is in fact a participant and 
initiator of these conflicts, seeking to maintain its influence in the region at any cost. Therefore, the EU's role in 
Eastern neighborhood countries should be strengthened," Landsbergis said.

Belarus is acting like a sovereign nation in its diplomatic crisis with Latvia - Lukashenko
MINSK, May 26, BNS/BELTA - Belarus, in expelling diplomats and employees of the Latvian Embassy in Minsk, 
acted as a sovereign state should do, said Alexander Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader of Belarus.
"In the situation regarding the Latvian Embassy, which was expelled in its entirety, Belarus acted as a sovereign 
nation-state is entitled to," Lukashenko said in a meeting with members of parliament, Constitutional Commission 
and government.
As reported, Latvian Ambassador to Belarus Einars Semanis on Monday was summoned to the Belarusian Foreign 
Ministry where he was told that he and other diplomats working at the Latvian embassy in Minsk have to leave the 
country, BNS was told at the Foreign Ministry.
Ambassador Semanis was given 24 hours and the other Latvian diplomats 48 hours to leave Belarus. The embassy 
is left with one administrative employee.
Responding to Belarus' decision, the Latvian Foreign Ministry summoned Belarus' charge d' affaires to inform that 
Belarusian diplomats are being expelled until relations between the two countries are normalized.
As BNS reported, Belarus' historical white-red-white flag was on Monday flown alongside the national flags of other 
nations participating in the Ice Hockey World Championship in Riga.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) and Riga Mayor Martins Stakis (For/Progressives) replaced 
Belarus' official flag with the white-red-white standard at the Radisson Blu Hotel Latvija where the Belarussian 
national ice hockey team is accommodated during the tournament.

Stakis said that the gesture was Riga City Council's initiative, backed by Belarus' opposition and intended to 
express support for the people who are suffering under the regime of Belarusian authoritarian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko.
As the Latvian foreign minister told BNS, by replacing Belarus' official flag with the historical white-red-white flag 
Latvia shows that it cannot and will not support the Belarusian authorities' crackdown on opposition activists.
He also noted that the hijacking of the Ryanair flight and capture of Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend was a 
violation of international law and that such operations posed threats to civilian air traffic, passengers and 
Protasevich, who had found refuge in a foreign country from reprisals in Belarus.

Seizure of aircraft by Belarus most likely did not take place without coordinating this with ''big neighbor'' - Pabriks
RIGA, May 26, BNS - The seizure of a civilian aircraft by Belarus most likely did not take place without coordinating 
this with ''big neighbor'', Minister of Defense Artis Pabriks (For Development) told Latvian Television this morning.
The Minister believes that the restrictions on air traffic with Belarus set by the European Council and later also by 
the Cabinet of Ministers are timely and adequate steps, because this plane hijacking incident can even be 
described as state terrorism.
In Pabriks' view, economic sanctions should also follow, precisely against those who took part in the seizure of the 
plane - "similar to those who poisoned citizens of Great Britain".
Pabriks emphasized that after the hijacking of the Ryanair plane by Belarus, the level of threat to Latvia has not 
changed. According to the Minister, the Belarusian government's move was aimed at the country's opposition.
The politician also admitted that such a decision could have been coordinated with the Russian leadership. "Such a 
decision probably was not made without coordination with the big neighbor. So far, there is no evidence of that, but 
I do not think that Lukashenko himself would take such a step," Pabriks said.
As reported, on Tuesday evening, the government imposed restrictions on air carriers registered in Belarus on the 
issuing of flight permits and thus enter Latvian airspace and use Latvian airports, BNS was told by the Ministry of 
Transport.
The use of Belarusian airspace and airports by Latvian aircraft has also been restricted. The decision shall take 
effect immediately.

evaluating the information available made available by aviation safety authorities and responding to the initiative of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The government decision also stipulates that Latvian airports will not service aircraft of other countries that use 
Belarusian airspace on their flight route.
This means that the Ministry of Transport will suspend the flight permit for the Belarusian airline Belavia and will not 
issue non-scheduled flight permits to Belarusian carriers. The airBaltic route permit to Minsk will also be suspended.
The Civil Aviation Agency (CAA) has carried out a risk assessment of Belarusian airspace and has identified it as 
unsafe for civil aircraft operations.
Latvian carriers are advised not to use Belarusian airspace.

Lithuanian PM on Lukashenko's threats: regime is unpredictable
VILNIUS, May 26, BNS – Alexander Lukashenko's regime is unpredictable and one has to be prepared for 
anything, Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said on Wednesday, commenting on the Belarusian 
authoritarian leader's threats to flood Europe with "migrants and drugs".
"This is an unpredictable regime from which you can expect anything, and you have to be prepared for anything," 
Simonyte told a news conference.
"We've been reinforcing the protection of our border for years and intend to do so in the future. We'll continue to use 
all means to protect the citizens, the state and the economy of Lithuania," she said.
Simonyte noted that Lukashenko's address to the parliament was obviously aimed at convincing Belarusians of the 
legitimacy of his actions.
"Commenting on Lukashenko's statements from a common-sense point of view has been more than difficult, almost 
impossible, for a long time now. This is the same regime as that of the Kremlin which will come up with any, even 
the most absurd narrative to justify its actions," the prime minister said.
"Their aim isn't to convince you, me, the European Union or the international community. Their aim is to convince 
their societies, continue to intimidate them and repeat the same narrative that they are surrounded by enemies 
whishing these countries ill," she said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Lukashenko told the parliament that "attacks" against Belarus had crossed "red lines".
"We were stopping migrants and drugs – now you will catch them and eat them yourselves," he said.

"I acted lawfully to protect our people," Lukashenko said, dismissing the international outcry over Sunday's forced 
landing of Ryanair's Athens-Vilnius flight in Minsk and the arrest of opposition activist Raman Pratasevich.

Government introduces restrictions on air traffic with Belarus
RIGA, May 26, BNS - On Tuesday evening, the government imposed restrictions on air carriers registered in 
Belarus on the issuing of flight permits and thus enter Latvian airspace and use Latvian airports, BNS was told by 
the Ministry of Transport.
The use of Belarusian airspace and airports by Latvian aircraft has also been restricted. The decision shall take 
effect immediately.
Such decisions were made at the government meeting in response to the actions of the Belarussian authorities, 
intercepting and forcibly landing a civilian passenger aircraft of the European Union airline Ryanair at Minsk Airport, 
evaluating the information available made available by aviation safety authorities and responding to the initiative of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The government decision also stipulates that Latvian airports will not service aircraft of other countries that use 
Belarusian airspace on their flight route.
This means that the Ministry of Transport will suspend the flight permit for the Belarusian airline Belavia and will not 
issue non-scheduled flight permits to Belarusian carriers. The airBaltic route permit to Minsk will also be suspended.
The Civil Aviation Agency (CAA) has carried out a risk assessment of Belarusian airspace and has identified it as 
unsafe for civil aircraft operations.
Latvian carriers are advised not to use Belarusian airspace.

(w/ADD) - Government introduces restrictions on air traffic with Belarus
The CAA risk assessment covers both flights using Belarusian airspace to other destinations and flights to and from 
Belarusian airports. The CAA assessed not only the incident with the Ryanair aircraft, but also the incident with the 
Lufthansa aircraft, which indicates possible provocations. The risk assessment is also based on the opinions 
provided by international and national partners.
The CAA has concluded that there are various potential aviation security risks that cannot be ruled out at present, 
such as the risk of a collision of civil aircraft with military aircraft, the risk of using weapons against civil aircraft, the 
arrest or detention of Latvian civil aircraft, crews and passengers.
Unjustified in-flight diversions are also possible, as well as in-flight provocations and other currently unpredictable 
risks that could pose a threat to civil aviation safety, the CAA warns.
The CAA risk assessment has been announced to stakeholders and the recommendations will take effect on May 
26. Latvian carriers have not used Belarusian airspace since the afternoon of Sunday, May 23.
The CAA has been ordered by government order to conduct a safety assessment of flights in Belarusian airspace 
by submitting a report to the Ministry of Transport.
"This is an unprecedented case in the history of civil aviation and a violation of the Convention on International Civil 
Aviation. It threatened the safety of passengers, crew and aircraft. I am pleased that the incident was assessed by 
the European Council yesterday, and the recommendations made are in accordancw with the position of the 
Latvian government - our decisions are coordinated and balanced,'' Minister of Transport Talis Linkaits (New 
Conservative Party) said.

Flight intensity in Latvia rises 5% as carriers avoid Belarusian airspace - Civil Aviation Agency
RIGA, May 26, BNS - Flight intensity in Latvia might be increased by an estimated 5 percent as airlines have 
started to avoid Belarusian airspace, Maris Gorodcovs, director of the Civil Aviation Agency (CAA), said in an 
interview with TV3 channel on Wednesday.
"We estimated that the increase might be about 5 percent, but it is likely to be short-term," Gorodcovs said, adding 
that there will be more clarity on how flight intensity has changed once all flights are rescheduled.
Arnis Lapins, a representative of Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme (LGS) air navigation services provider, told BNS earlier 
that "real estimates" on how the situation has affected Latvian airspace might be available sometime at the 
beginning of June.
As reported, on Tuesday evening, the government imposed restrictions on air carriers registered in Belarus on the 
issuing of flight permits and thus enter Latvian airspace and use Latvian airports, BNS was told by the Ministry of

Riga Airport to lose EUR 20,000 worth of monthly revenue from suspension of flights to and from Minsk
RIGA, May 26, BNS - Riga International Airport is expected to lose EUR 20,000 worth of monthly revenue from the 
suspension of flights to and from Minsk, the airport informed BNS.
The airport points out that the lost revenue consists of aviation and ground handling fees, as well as lost revenue 
from cargo handling. The decision has no effect on the number of employees at Riga Airport.
Riga Airport has so far served five flights to and from Minsk per week. Belavia operated three flights per week 
between the two cities, but airBaltic - two flights per week.

airBaltic expects avoiding Belarusian airspace to cost EUR 200,000 per month
RIGA, May 26, BNS - Latvia's airBaltic national carrier expects making detours to avoid flying into Belarusian 
airspace to cost EUR 200,000 per month, BNS was told at the company.
The airline's representatives indicated that the ban on using Belarusian airspace will affect 29 airBaltic flights or 8.1 
percent of all flights scheduled for this week. The proportion will remain roughly the same also in following weeks.
The duration of each affected flight is likely to increase by around 10 minutes, according to current estimates. 
Passengers of the affected flights will be sent emails to inform them about the changes.
airBaltic representatives said that the company would contact all passengers whose flights to Minsk have been 
cancelled by sending them emails. They will be offered to change the date or route of the flight. Alternatively, the 
passengers of the cancelled flights will be able to receive their fare money back.

No changes are currently being planned in relation to passenger traffic by land with Belarus - Linkaits
RIGA, May 26, BNS - After the government made the decision to restrict air traffic with Belarus, no changes are 
currently being planned on relation to passenger traffic by land with Belarus, Minister of Transport Talis Linkaits 
(New Conservative Party) told members of the press on Wednesday.
He reminded that the current Covid-19 restrictions currently prevent regular and non-scheduled passenger traffic by 
land to and from third countries, including Belarus.
At the same time, the Minister emphasized that the state borders are always open to Latvian citizens when 
returning home, allowing that this return "home" can take place both by land and in other possible ways.
Linkaits also explained that when deciding to restrict air traffic with Belarus, the safety of people and carriers was 
the primary consideration, not economic ones.
The Minister noted that the European Commission will assess the impact of the decision on the entire European 
aviation sector, considering the possibility of establishing some compensatory mechanisms to mitigate the 
economic consequences.
As reported, on Tuesday evening, the government imposed restrictions on air carriers registered in Belarus on the

Losses from suspension of air traffic with Belarus will reach thousands, not millions - Linkaits
RIGA, May 26, BNS - Losses that Latvia will incur from the suspension of air traffic with Belarus will reach 
thousands, not millions of euros, Transport Minister Talis Linkaits (New Conservative Party, JKP) said in an 
interview with TV3 channel Wednesday.
"As we took the decision on the restrictions, we asked all the parties concerned to provide information on the losses 
that might be incurred. The losses are not expected to reach millions," said Linkaits, adding that the losses are 
projected to reach thousands of euros.
Linkaits noted that it is also possible that the European Union will provide some compensatory mechanisms.
"In this situation, passengers' safety is paramount and the economic aspect did not play a role in taking the 
decision," the transport minister said.
Linkaits said that for the time being it is difficult to predict how long the air traffic restrictions might last. The Civil 
Aviation Agency will be following the developments and assessing the security of flights, Linkaits said.
The minister noted that before the Covid-19 pandemic, flights between Riga and Minsk were among the most 
popular routes but that during the pandemic there have been very few flights on this route. This season, Latvia's 
airBaltic carrier had planned to operate up to three flights per week on the Riga-Minsk route and Belarus' airline had 
also planned three flights per week.
As reported, on Tuesday evening, the government imposed restrictions on air carriers registered in Belarus on the 
issuing of flight permits and thus enter Latvian airspace and use Latvian airports, BNS was told by the Ministry of

Ministry proposes banning Belarusian air carriers from Lithuania's airspace
VILNIUS, May 26, BNS – Lithuania's Transport Ministry has proposed to the country's government to ban 
Belarusian air carriers from entering Lithuania's airspace. Such a ban would, first of all, apply to Belarusian state 
airline Belavia. The latter announced on Monday it had suspended flights to Lithuania.
If the government approves, the ban will come into force after midnight on May 27.
Belavia is already banned from flying to Latvia, Ukraine, Sweden, the UK, France and the Czech Republic. The 
moves come in response to the forced landing of a Ryanair Athens-Vilnius plane last Sunday in Minsk.
The West have slammed the Belarusian regime's behavior and also started diverting their planes away from 
Belarus. Lithuania was one of the first countries on Tuesday to ban planes from entering or leaving its airports for 
planes flying via the Belarusian airspace.

Lithuania bans Belarus' air carriers from its airspace
VILNIUS, May 26, BNS – The government on Wednesday banned Belarusian air carriers from entering Lithuanian 
airspace as of 3 a.m. on May 27.
The ban primarily affects Belarus' flag carrier Belavia which on Monday suspended flights to Lithuania.
"The European Council said in its conclusions very clearly that Belarusian airlines should be banned from using EU 
airspace," Transport Minister Marius Skuodis told the Cabinet.
The EU Aviation Safety Agency on Tuesday recommended that all EU-based airlines avoid Belarusian airspace.
Lithuania was among the first countries to prohibit any flights to or from its airports via Belarusian airspace as of 
Tuesday.
Belavia has already been banned from flying to Latvia, Ukraine, Sweden, the UK, France and the Czech Republic.
The moves come in response to Sunday's forced landing of Ryanair's Athens-Vilnius flight in Minsk and the arrest 
of opposition activist Raman Pratasevich.

Replacing of Belarusian flag is adequate political response and signal that we do not recognize the regime - Levits
RIGA, May 25, BNS - The replacing of Belarus' official flag at the Ice Hockey World Championship in Riga is an 
adequate political response and a signal that we do not recognize the neighbor country's ruling regime, President 
Egils Levits said in an interview to TV3 channel on Tuesday.
In Levits' view, Belarus' decision to order all Latvian diplomats out of the country was a reaction to Latvia's 
consistent actions, which followed Belarus' "unprecedented violation of international law that threatened 
international air traffic".
Underlining that Latvia, too, was affected by the incident in which Belarus hijacked a passenger plane, because 
there were two Latvian citizens on board the Ryanair flight, Levits indicated that Latvia proposed a number of 
measures to deal with the situation, which the European Council adopted.
"We defend international law and the security of international aviation. I think this is proof that Belarus has now 
made itself an outlaw," the Latvian president said.
The Latvian president said that in his opinion, the replacing of the Belarusian flag in Riga is an adequate political 
response and a sign of the non-recognition of Belarus' ruling regime, while the white-red-white flag used by Belarus' 
political opposition is the country's historical flag.
As reported, on 23 May, the Belarusian authorities ordered a fighter jet to force a Ryanair civilian flight FR 4978 to 
perform an emergency landing at Minsk National Airport so that an independent journalist and opposition activist 
from Belarus, Raman Pratasevich, could be detained.
Replacing of Belarusian flag is adequate political response and signal that we do not recognize the regime - 
Levits
Responding to this incident, Belarus' official flag that was flown alongside the national flags of other countries 
participating in the Ice Hockey World Championship in Riga was replaced with Belarus' historical white-red-white 
flag.
Latvian Ambassador to Belarus Einars Semanis was on Monday summoned to the Belarusian Foreign Ministry 
where he was told that he and other Latvian diplomats are ordered to leave Belarus.
The ambassador was given 24 hours and the other diplomats 48 hours to leave the country. One administrative 
employee was allowed to stay on to look after the embassy building.
In response to the expulsion of its diplomatic staff, the Latvian Foreign Ministry summoned Belarus' charge d' 
affaires to inform that Belarus' diplomats are being expelled from Latvia until relations between the two countries 
are normalized.

(w/CORR) Belarus expels Latvian ambassador and other diplomats, Latvia responds with identical move
(Corrects the name of the Latvian ambassador in lead and paragraph 2)
RIGA, May 25, BNS - Latvian Ambassador to Belarus Einars Semanis on Monday was summoned to the 
Belarusian Foreign Ministry where he was told that he and other diplomats working at the Latvian embassy in Minsk 
have to leave the country, BNS was told at the Foreign Ministry.
Ambassador Semanis was given 24 hours and the other Latvian diplomats 48 hours to leave Belarus. The embassy 
is left with one administrative employee.
Responding to Belarus' decision, the Latvian Foreign Ministry summoned Belarus' charge d' affaires to inform that 
Belarusian diplomats are being expelled until relations between the two countries are normalized.
As BNS reported, Belarus' historical white-red-white flag was on Monday flown alongside the national flags of other 
nations participating in the Ice Hockey World Championship in Riga.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) and Riga Mayor Martins Stakis (For/Progressives) replaced 
Belarus' official flag with the white-red-white standard at the Radisson Blu Hotel Latvija where the Belarussian 
national ice hockey team is accommodated during the tournament.
Stakis said that the gesture was Riga City Council's initiative, backed by Belarus' opposition and intended to 
express support for the people who are suffering under the regime of Belarusian authoritarian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko.
"Riga is demonstrating solidarity with Belarus' people, opposition and refugees. For a free Belarus!" Stakis said at 
the event.
(w/CORR) Belarus expels Latvian ambassador and other diplomats, Latvia responds with identical move
Rinkevics indicated that sanctions and statements are one thing, but this step - replacing the flag - is stronger as a 
symbolic act.
The Latvian foreign minister added that the replacing of Belarus' official flag with the white-red-white one also 
shows Latvia's attitude to the Belarusian authorities' 'act of terror' - the forced landing of a passenger flight to arrest 
an opposition journalist.
Rinkevics also voiced hope that the meeting of EU leaders, which is taking place in Brussels, will result in an 
agreement on member states' joint response to Belarus' actions - the hijacking of a Ryanair plane and capturing 
one of its passengers, opposition activist and journalist Raman Pratasevich.
As the Latvian foreign minister told BNS, by replacing Belarus' official flag with the historical white-red-white flag 
Latvia shows that it cannot and will not support the Belarusian authorities' crackdown on opposition activists.
He also noted that the hijacking of the Ryanair flight and capture of Protasevich and his girlfriend is a violation of 
international law and that such operations pose threats to civilian air traffic, passengers and Protasevich, who had 
found refuge in a foreign country from reprisals in Belarus.
The foreign minister also said that Riga entrusted with hosting the ice hockey championship after the events that 
shook Belarus last year and that the change of flags was a symbolic demonstration that Latvia is with the 
Belarusian people and not with Lukashenko's regime.

Latvian embassy in Minsk stops performing consular functions
RIGA, May 25, BNS - In connection with the expulsion of Latvian diplomats from Belarus, the Latvian Embassy in 
Minsk has indefinitely discontinued the provision of consular services, BNS was told at the Latvian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry said that Latvian nationals who find themselves in an emergency situation in Belarus and require 
consular assistance (for instance, upon losing their identity document) are requested to contact an embassy of any 
EU member state in Minsk, the Latvian Consulate in Vitsebsk, or the Consular Department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs by calling the hotline +371 26337711.
To inquire about the possibilities for receiving consular services (passports/ID, statements etc.), the Foreign 
Ministry advises to contact any diplomatic or consular mission of Latvia, for instance, the Consulate in Vitsebsk, the 
Latvian Embassy in Ukraine, the Latvian Embassy in Poland, etc.
Entry visas to Latvia can only be received at the Latvian Consulate in Vitsebsk by persons whose permanent place 
of residence is registered in the Vitsebsk Region. In addition, the Consulate accepts visa applications from cargo 
and passenger carriers as well as persons who are under the threat of persecution for political reasons in Belarus.
As reported, Latvian Ambassador to Belarus Einars Semanis on Monday was summoned to the Belarusian Foreign 
Ministry where he was told that he and other diplomats working at the Latvian embassy in Minsk have to leave the 
country, BNS was told at the Foreign Ministry.
Ambassador Semanis was given 24 hours and the other Latvian diplomats 48 hours to leave Belarus. The embassy 
is left with one administrative employee.
Responding to Belarus' decision, the Latvian Foreign Ministry summoned Belarus' charge d' affaires to inform that 
Belarusian diplomats are being expelled until relations between the two countries are normalized.

As BNS reported, Belarus' historical white-red-white flag was on Monday flown alongside the national flags of other 
nations participating in the Ice Hockey World Championship in Riga.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) and Riga Mayor Martins Stakis (For/Progressives) replaced 
Belarus' official flag with the white-red-white standard at the Radisson Blu Hotel Latvija where the Belarussian 
national ice hockey team is accommodated during the tournament.
Stakis said that the gesture was Riga City Council's initiative, backed by Belarus' opposition and intended to 
express support for the people who are suffering under the regime of Belarusian authoritarian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko.
As the Latvian foreign minister told BNS, by replacing Belarus' official flag with the historical white-red-white flag 
Latvia shows that it cannot and will not support the Belarusian authorities' crackdown on opposition activists.
He also noted that the hijacking of the Ryanair flight and capture of Protasevich and his girlfriend was a violation of 
international law and that such operations posed threats to civilian air traffic, passengers and Protasevich, who had 
found refuge in a foreign country from reprisals in Belarus.

Lithuanian president on EU leaders' decisions: sending signal swiftly was key
VILNIUS, May 25, BNS – EU leaders acted unusually swiftly and unanimously to condemn the Belarusian regime's 
actions and agree on new targeted economic sanctions, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said after the 
European Council's meeting.
"It was very important for us to send a signal, and send it so swiftly as to leave no doubt to anyone [who thinks] that 
the Council of Europe is debating, philosophizing and making no decisions," Nauseda said in a video emailed by his 
office.
"That is why we ended the discussion earlier than I had expected, and the text was approved quite unanimously 
and swiftly, and circulated very early by Brussels standards," he added.
In the course of discussion, it was agreed to expand the list of sanctions against both individuals and legal entities 
linked to the Minsk regime and to include targeted economic sanctions to be proposed by the European 
Commission, according to the president.
"These targeted economic sanctions emerged for a reason. We are really concerned that broad economic 
measures could adversely affect Belarus' civil society and people fighting against the regime, too," Nauseda said.
"Therefore, measures have to be used in a sensitive way and aimed primarily at those responsible for these 
horrendous acts now being committed by the Belarusian regime," he said.
Lithuania was given the opportunity to start the discussion at the European Council's meeting on Monday, 
according to Nauseda.
Lithuanian president on EU leaders' decisions: sending signal swiftly was key
"I believe that was because of our active stance both last August and in the months that followed, and, of course, 
because we were directly affected by this unprecedented event," he said.
Belarus' forced grounding of Ryanair's Vilnius-bound passenger flight from Athens prompted EU leaders to listen to 
Lithuania's concerns about the Astravyets nuclear power plant, according to the president.
"I also specifically raised the Astravyets issue, because this facility looks even more frightening in the current 
context," he said. "If the regime can ignore the danger to the lives of people aboard a flight, it may care even less 
about potential consequences of an incident at the Astravyets plant."
"My colleagues took this information with understanding and I think that our discussions with the European 
Commission and with our Latvian and Estonian colleagues about not buying electricity from Belarus should move 
much faster and yield more tangible results."
The European Council had "a historic and very diverse discussion", Nauseda said, adding that "perhaps for the first 
time after a long break, we took a very principled and very profound position on the Russian issue."
A united EU position that is resilient to Russia's pressure gives more motivation and hope to the Eastern 
Partnership countries, he noted.
On Monday, EU leaders strongly condemned the forced landing of the Ryanair flight in Minsk and the detention by 
Belarusian authorities of journalist Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, and urged EU-based airlines 
to avoid Belarusian airspace.
They also asked the Council to adopt further targeted economic sanctions against the Minsk regime and called on 
the International Civil Aviation Organization "to urgently investigate this unprecedented and unacceptable incident".
The leaders called "on the Council to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian 
airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines".
They also expressed solidarity with Latvia following Minsk's expulsion of its embassy staff after Belarus' official flag 
was replaced with the white-and-red one used by the opposition at the world ice hockey championship in Riga.

Tsikhanouskaya says she received Borell's pledge on further sanctions for Belarus in July
VILNIUS, May 25, BNS – Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya says she has been assured by 
the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell that the European Union will consider further sanctions against Belarus 
shortly, including the 5th package in July.
"Yesterday I made a call with EU High Representative Josep Borell. He told that the EU is planning to adopt the 4th 
package of sanctions and prepare the 5th package in July," Tsikhanouskaya said in a video statement in Vilnius on 
Tuesday.
She also thanked EU member states for their strong reaction to the recent forced landing of a passenger place by 
the Minsk regime and the detention of opposition blogger Raman Pratasevich and his girlfriend who were on the 
plane.
Tsikhanouskaya paid attention to the fact airlines "one after another" are suspending flights via the Belarusian 
airspace and EU member states say they are closing their airspaces for Belarusian state airline Belavia.
Nevertheless, she said, suspending flights over Belarus only is not enough.
"Let me emphasize: the suspension of flights over Belarus doesn't solve the real problem. The problem is that the 
terrorist regime that rigged the elections last year regularly violates the Constitution and brakes international law. 
Lukashenko's regime is a threat to regional and European security. The only solution to this crisis is to conduct a 
free and fair election and democratic reforms. But now we should stop violence and lawlessness. We ask for 
sanctions against the regime, its cronies and businesses," Tsikhanouskaya said.
Tsikhanouskaya says she received Borell's pledge on further sanctions for Belarus in July
She also pointed out that it’s been two days after Pratasevich and his girlfriend's kidnap and a lawyer is still not 
allowed to see Pratasevich. Tsikhanouskaya has no doubt that the opposition blogger is being tortured, adding that 
he was forced to "confess".
"I think we have already watched the video with imprisoned Raman. He said that he's being treated lawfully but he's 
clearly beaten and under pressure. There's no doubt that he must have been tortured," she said.
Tsikhanouskaya also said she had discussed the situation with the Polish and French foreign ministers and US 
President Joe Biden's national security adviser. She said she asked the Polish and US representatives to 
investigate the plane's hijacking and back the suspension of Belarus' ICAO and Interpol memberships.
In he words, the death of political prisoner Vitold Ashurak, the recent hijacking of the Ryanair plane and the closure 
of popular opposition news website tut.by "is the result of the regime's impunity and lack of proper response to its 
actions:
"Therefore, the response must be comprehensive, including sanctions and the political isolation of the regime. This 
is time to act," she said.
The Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian airspace and 
was diverted to Minsk where it landed on Sunday afternoon.
The airline said the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers 
of "a potential security threat on board" but "nothing untoward was found).
Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the Nexta information channel Raman Pratasevich was 
detained after the plane landed in Minsk, alongside his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen and student of the 
Vilnius-based European Humanities University.
Last year, Belarus put Pratasevich, 26, and Sciapan Pucila, 22, a co-founder of the Nexta channel, on the list of 
persons engaged in terrorist activity and also declared the channel to be extremist and ordered to block it.
The flight returned from Minsk to Vilnius on Sunday evening.
Leaders of NATO, the European Commission and some EU member countries have condemned the incident.

Lithuania asks UN agency to declare Belarusian airspace unsafe
VILNIUS, May 25, BNS – Lithuania has asked the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to declare 
Belarus' airspace unsafe and launch an investigation into the recent forced landing of a passenger plane en route to 
Vilnius in Minsk.
According to Lithuania's Transport Ministry, Lithuania has officially turned to the UN agency over the Sunday 
incident.
"Lithuania is officially asking the ICAO to launch an international investigation into all circumstances of this incident 
and is ready to provide all information for such an investigation. We are also asking to declare the Belarusian 
airspace unsafe," Lithuanian Transport Minister Marius Skuodis was quoted as saying in a statement released by 
the ministry of Tuesday.
It also states that there are serious signs that the Ryanair plane's forced landing violated the Chicago Convention 
and might be considered an unlawful action.
According to Skuodis, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency has expressed its concern over threat to 
commercial flights over Belarus. The agency recommends for all European air carries to exercise caution when 
flying in the Minsk flight information region or above it.
On Monday, the Lithuanian government banned all incoming or outgoing flight operations over the territory of 
Belarus.

Lithuanian parlt calls for ending financial assistance to Belarusian state projects
VILNIUS, May 25, BNS – The Seimas of Lithuania considers the recent forced landing of a passenger plane in 
Minsk to be an act of state terror carried out by Belarus and calls on international financial institutions to end 
assistance for Belarusian state projects, according to a draft resolution being considered by Lithuania lawmakers.
A vote on it is set to be held on later on Tuesday.
Members of the Liberal Movement, part of the ruling block in Lithuania, are today attending a plenary Seimas sitting 
wearing T-shirts with an inscription in the Belarusian language "I/We – Roman Protasevic".
"The Seimas urges international financial institutions, institutions and agencies from EU countries, providing 
financial and export credits and guarantees, to end guarantee and assistance mechanisms for state projects being 
implemented in Belarus and providing direct or indirect benefit for Alexander Lukashenko's regime," the draft 
resolution says.
It also urges the European Union to end sectoral cooperation, technical and financial assistance instruments and 
other cooperation programs with Belarus.
EU member states and institutions are urged to immediately respond to the threat posed by the Belarusian regime 
to international civil aviation and ban EU national airlines flying above Belarus' airspace, ban Belarusian airlines 
from entering the EU territory and include Belarusian state airline Belavia into the EU's fourth sanction package and 
ban it from using the EU airspace.
The International Civil Aviation Organization is being urged to immediately carry out an international investigation 
into this incident and suspend Belarus' ICAO membership during the investigation period.

The draft resolution also calls for swift adoption of the full fourth package of the EU's targeted sanctions by 
additionally including all persons and organizations responsible for the Sunday incident, and also for the start of the 
creation of a fifth package of the EU's targeted sanctions for regime-linked companies exporting to the EU, as well 
as persons who contributed to the Ryanair plane's hijacking.
The Seimas proposed turning to international partners and ask them to take join action within the framework of the 
United Nations, NATO, G7 and other international organizations over the assessment of the threat posed by the 
Belarusian regime and the release of Pratasevich, Sofia Sapega and other people detained and imprisoned by the 
Belarusian regime for political motives.

Providing assistance to Latvians in Belarus will be difficult after diplomats' expulsion - Kalnina-Lukasevica
BRUSSELS, May 25, BNS - Providing assistance to Latvian citizens in Belarus will be difficult after Latvian 
diplomats' expulsion from Belarus, Foreign Ministry Parliamentary Secretary Zanda Kalnina-Lukasevica (New Unity) 
said in an interview to Latvian Television on Tuesday.
The parliamentary secretary said that Belarus has ordered all Latvian diplomats to leave the country, except one 
technical employee who will be looking after the embassy building.
The expulsion means that the consular employees who routinely provide assistance to Latvian citizens in need, are 
also leaving Belarus. Kalnina-Lukasevica said that Latvia is now unable not only to help its citizens in Belarus but 
also issue visas to Belarusian asylum seekers.
Asked if Latvian citizens should be advised against traveling to Belarus, the Foreign Ministry's parliamentary 
secretary said that the situation is escalating. "The possibilities to ensure our citizens' security there are limited, so I 
must say that the situation is not safe and risks exist," Kalnina-Lukasevica said.
As reported, The European Union agreed Monday to impose sanctions against Belarus, including banning its 
airlines from using the airspace and airports of the 27-nation bloc, amid fury over the forced diversion of a 
passenger jet to arrest an opposition journalist.
In what EU leaders have called a brazen “hijacking” of the Ryanair jetliner flying from Greece to Lithuania on 
Sunday, they also demanded the immediate release of the journalist, Raman Pratasevich, a key foe of authoritarian 
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
The EU leaders also urged all EU-based carriers to avoid flying over Belarus, decided to impose sanctions on 
officials linked to Sunday's flight diversion, and urged the International Civil Aviation Organization to start an 
Providing assistance to Latvians in Belarus will be difficult after diplomats' expulsion - Kalnina-Lukasevica
investigation into what they see as an unprecedented move and what some said amounted to state terrorism or 
piracy.
The leaders called on the European Council “to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace by 
Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines.” In addition to 
Pratasevich, they also urged authorities in Minsk to release his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, who was taken off 
the plane with him.
The text was endorsed quickly by leaders determined to oppose a “strong reaction” to the incident because of the 
“serious endangering of aviation safety and passengers on board by Belarussian authorities,” according to an EU 
official with direct knowledge of the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly about the private talks.
The Belarusian Foreign Ministry bristled at what it described as “belligerent” EU statements, insisting Minsk acted 
“in full conformity with international rules.”
It ordered all Latvian diplomats out of the country after the Belarusian flag was replaced Monday with the white-and-
red one used by the opposition at the world ice hockey championship in Riga, Latvia. The event was moved from 
Minsk amid the international outcry over the crackdown.

Estonia recommends that airlines avoid Belarusian airspace
TALLINN, May 25, BNS - The Estonian Transport Administration is sending a recommendation to all airlines to 
avoid Belarusian airspace and make changes to flight schedules accordingly.
The recommendation will come into force on May 25 and is based on Monday's European Council decision calling 
on all European Union airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace on flights, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and 
Communications said.
"Many airlines have already decided not to fly over Belarus. Europe's top executives reached the same position late 
last night [Monday], and Estonia's official recommendation today also goes to all Estonian airlines. For passengers, 
this means longer flight times on some flights, slightly higher fuel consumption for airlines, but we cannot ignore 
recent moves in Belarus," Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Taavi Aas said.
As the forced landing of the Ryanair aircraft may have violated the requirements of aviation conventions and other 
international agreements, the issue will also be addressed in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
this Sunday.
The decision to ban flights between Tallinn and Minsk and to close Estonian airspace to Belarusian air carriers will 
be made jointly with other EU member states in accordance with a decision to be made by the Council of the 
European Union. "Belavia will be able to fly until the expected sanctions plan towards Belarus is reached," Aas 
added.

Belarusians can't travel due to regime, not flight ban – Lithuanian president's aide
VILNIUS, May 25, BNS – Belarusians are prevented from travelling abroad by Alexander Lukashenko's regime, 
rather than by flight restrictions that EU leaders have decided to put in place after Sunday's forced diversion of a 
Ryanair flight to Minsk, President Gitanas Nauseda's chief foreign policy advisor said on Tuesday.
"Travel by Belarusian people is hampered by the regime, not the physical means of travel," Asta Skaisgiryte told the 
Ziniu Radijas radio station.
"The Lukashenko regime prohibits Belarusians from leaving [the country]. There are very strict requirements based 
on which Belarusian citizens can go abroad," the advisor said.
"This is the problem," she added. "People can travel by road if they are allowed to."
The advisor was commenting on publicly voiced concerns that the EU's flight restrictions might affect not only the 
Minsk regime, but also ordinary Belarusian citizens.
On Monday, EU leaders called "on the Council to adopt the necessary measures to ban overflight of EU airspace 
by Belarusian airlines and prevent access to EU airports of flights operated by such airlines".
Air France, Finnair, Lufthansa and other air carriers have decided to reroute flights to avoid Belarusian airspace. 
Lithuania and Ukraine have imposed restrictions on flights via Belarus, and the UK has closed its airports to 
Belavia, Belarus' national airline.
Belavia has cancelled flights to Lithuania until June 26, and flights to France and the United Kingdom until October 
30.

Estonian PM: EU to deliver strong response to Belarus with additional sanctions
TALLINN, May 25, BNS - According to Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, the European Council will deliver 
Belarus a quick and strong response by way of economic sanctions and flight restrictions.
On the first day of European Council meeting, EU heads of state and government strongly condemned the forced 
landing of a Ryanair passenger aircraft in Minsk and the detention by Belarus of journalist and opposition activist 
Raman Pratasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega. EU leaders demand the immediate release of both and their 
freedom of movement.
"The Belarusian regime has committed a national terrorist attack by hijacking a passenger plane flying between the 
capitals of two EU member states," Kallas said. "The way in which Alexander Lukashenko's regime arrested a 
government-critical journalist is unacceptable and will not go unpunished," she added.
The Council decided that the European Union would swiftly prepare and impose additional sanctions on Belarusian 
officials and companies closely associated with the regime, and would develop economic sanctions.
The Council also called on all airlines operating in the European Union to avoid Belarusian airspace and decided to 
start preparations to ban overflights of Belarusian airlines from EU airspace and to prevent them from accessing EU 
airports. "It is in the interests of the security of the citizens of our countries that European Union planes do not fly 
over Belarusian airspace," Kallas said.
In addition, the Council called on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to investigate the specific case 
as soon as possible.
According to Kallas, Estonia plans to initiate a discussion of the case in the UN Security Council as soon as 
possible.
Estonian PM: EU to deliver strong response to Belarus with additional sanctions
On Monday evening, the Council also held a strategic debate on the European Union's relations with Russia and 
reaffirmed its adherence to the five established principles. These principles include the full implementation of the 
Minsk agreements, the strengthening of relations with Eastern Partnership countries, the strengthening of the EU's 
agility, selective cooperation on foreign policy issues and other areas of clear EU interest, and the need to support 
Russian civil society and people-to-people contacts.
"Russia knows that if it wants constructive and better relations with the EU, it must stop aggression against Ukraine 
and Georgia. Crimes committed by Russia on the territory of EU member states are also completely unacceptable 
and cannot be left unanswered. The European Union must be united and firm in its relations with Russia," Kallas 
said.

Latvian police starts in-house probe into interception of Ryanair aircraft in Minsk
RIGA, May 25, BNS - The Latvian State Police has started an in-house probe into interception of Ryanair aircraft in 
Minsk, the police spokeswoman Simona Gravite told BNS.
The probe has been launched because there were two Latvian nationals on the plane.
The Latvian State Security Service (VDD) told BNS that VDD is not yet involved in investigation of the case. At the 
same time, VDD is ready to provide all necessary support.
As reported, the Lithuanian Prosecutor General's Office on Sunday launched a pre-trial investigation in the 
incidence. The Lithuanian authorities interrogated some of the airplane passengers after the plane landed in Vilnius 
airport.
As reported, on 23 May, the Belarusian authorities ordered a fighter jet to force a Ryanair civilian flight FR 4978 to 
perform an emergency landing at Minsk National Airport so that an independent journalist and opposition activist 
from Belarus, Raman Pratasevich, could be detained.

Lithuanian formin urges halt to Western-funded projects at Belarus' N-plant
VILNIUS, May 25, BNS – Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday called for "an immediate 
halt" to projects financed by international institutions and carried out by Western companies at Belarus' Astravyets 
nuclear power plant.
"To our knowledge, certain additional technical works have been launched at the Astravyets nuclear power plant 
and are being performed by Western companies," Landsbergis told LRT Radio. "To our knowledge, those works are 
financed by international financial institutions".
Such projects must be "stopped immediately", he added.
Lithuania included the issue to its position for the European Council's meeting on Monday.
President Gitanas Nauseda said after the meeting that Belarus' forced grounding of Ryanair's Vilnius-bound 
passenger flight from Athens prompted EU leaders to listen to Lithuania's concerns about the Astravyets plant.
Vilnius says Belarus' nuclear power plant in Astravyets, close to the countries' shared border, fails to meet 
international safety and environmental standards, an allegation that Minsk denies.

Five passengers of diverted Ryanair flight didn't arrive in Vilnius – Lithuanian governmen
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Five passengers of Ryanair's Vilnius-bound flight from Athens did not arrive in the 
Lithuanian capital following the plane's forced landing in Minsk, the government said on Monday.
A total of 126 passengers boarded the flight in the Greek capital, but only 121 of them came to Vilnius.
Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and co-founder of the Telegram channel Nexta, and 
his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen who is a student of Vilnius-based European Humanities University, 
were arrested when they disembarked from the plane in Minsk.
Sources have told BNS that another two of the five people who stayed behind in Minsk are Belarusian citizens. The 
authorities have not disclosed yet if they have any link to the incident.
When asked if all passengers had been identified, Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte said at a news conference on 
Monday that she could not answer the question because of an ongoing pre-trial investigation into the incident.
"I can only say that all Lithuanian citizens have safely returned to Lithuania,” she said.
It is not clear yet either if people who were aboard the flight may claim compensation, according to the prime 
minister.
The Ryanair flight, scheduled to arrive in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, was forced to change course just before 
crossing into Lithuanian airspace.
According to the Irish airline, the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air 
traffic controllers of "a potential security threat on board", but "nothing untoward" was found.

Asta Skaisgiryte, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda's chief foreign policy advisor, said on Sunday that Belarus

to Minsk.
The flight returned from Minsk to Vilnius on Sunday evening.
The incident has been condemned by leaders of NATO, the European Commission and some EU member states.

Diverted Ryanair flight lands in Vilnius
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS - Ryanair's Athens-to-Vilnius flight landed in the Lithuanian capital's airport on Sunday 
evening after having been diverted by Belarus' authorities to Minsk in the afternoon.
The flight, scheduled to arrive in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, was instructed to change course just before crossing 
into Lithuanian airspace.
Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Lithuania's international airports, said the plane had been 
grounded due to a conflict between passengers and the crew, but Belarus said the aircraft had had to make an 
emergency landing after a bomb alert.
Belarusian opposition activist and blogger Raman Pratasevich was among the passengers. He was detained after 
the plane landed in Minsk.
Asta Skaisgiryte, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda's chief foreign policy advisor, said that Belarus had used 
two military aircraft – a MiG-29 fighter jet and a Mi-24 helicopter – to divert the civil passenger plane to Minsk.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said 171 passengers had been aboard the flight, including 94 
Lithuanian, 11 Greek and nine French nationals, and a number of citizens of Belarus, Poland, Romania, Germany, 
Latvia, Russia, Georgia and other countries.
Nauseda demanded the release of Pratasevich, the founder of the opposition Telegram channel Nexta, and urged 
the international community to take action.

Levits proposes discussing Belarus hijack of Ryanair plane on UN Security Council
RIGA, May 24, BNS - The hijacking of a passenger plane in Belarus is an issue that has to be discussed on the UN 
Security Council, because Belarus has violated international airspace rules, Latvian President Egils Levits said 
Monday.
As president's spokeswoman Justine Deicmane told BNS, Levits came up with this proposal already on Sunday 
while discussing the incident in Belarus with Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity).
Today, during an online meeting of the Baltic presidents, Estonia's Kersti Kaljulaid informed her Latvian and 
Lithuanian colleagues that Estonia, as a member of the UN Security Council,  plans to initiate a discussion at the 
Security Council on Sunday's events in Belarus at the earliest opportunity.
On Monday, the same topics were to be discussed by EU heads of government at a meeting of the European 
Council in Brussels.
A Ryanair plane that had taken off from Athens for a flight to Vilnius on Sunday was forces by  Belarusian 
authorities to turn back before crossing the Lithuanian border and make an emergency landing in Minsk. After the 
landing, Raman Pratasevich, an opposition activist and journalist who was onboard the flight, was detained. There 
were altogether 171 passengers onboard the flight, over half of them from Lithuania. The passengers also included 
citizens of  Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Spain, France, Georgia, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Belarus 
and Syria.

Closure of Belarus airspace for international flights should be considered - Rinkevics
RIGA, May 24, BNS - The EU should consider closure of Belarus airspace for its flights, said Latvian Foreign 
Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) in an interview with the Latvian public television today.
The politician said that Sunday's incidence in relation to diversions of Ryanair plane to Minsk will be discussed by 
EU leaders.
The minister said that it is necessary to consider a possibility to close the Belarus airspace for EU flights. Also, it 
should be considered how safe it is to fly to Belarus at all. Rinkevics believes that probably even a ban on Belarus 
national airline to fly to the EU should be considered.
The politician said that yesterday all passengers on the plane were endangered, therefore broader sanctions 
against Belarus should be considered.
As reported, the Ryanair flight, scheduled to arrive from Athens in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, changed course just 
before crossing into Lithuanian airspace.
The airline said the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers 
of "a potential security threat on board".
Belarus' opposition say that the flight was forced to land in Minsk to arrest one of its passengers, opposition activist 
and journalist Raman Pratasevich.
According to Lithuania's authorities, 171 passengers were aboard the Ryanair flight, including 94 Lithuanian, 11 
Greek and nine French nationals, and a number of citizens of Belarus, Poland, Romania, Germany, Latvia, Russia, 
Georgia and other countries.

Belarus authorities
RIGA, May 24, BNS - The Latvian parliament foreign committee and chairmen of parliament foreign committees of 
other western countries have issued a joint statement, condemning interception of Ryanair civil plane by Belarus 
authorities, Latvian parliament foreign committee chairman Rihards Kols (National Alliance) said in his Twitter post.
Foreign committee heads of the US, German, Polish, Czech, Latvian, Estonian, Lithuania and Irish parliaments

The statement underscored that interception of the plane was committed by threat of violence, while the aircraft was 
en route from one EU and NATO capital to another.
The committee chairmen call on EU and NATO member states to react to this incidence, for now banning flights to 
and from Belarus and all overflight of Belarus. Also, the parliament representatives demand release of the airplane 
passenger, opposition activist and journalist Raman Pratasevich.
Kols said in his Twitter post that "this cannot and will not go unpunished".
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) said in an interview with the Latvian public television today 
that the EU should consider closure of Belarus airspace for its flights.

Lithuania's SSD calls forced plane landing in Minsk "impertinent"
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – The recent forced landing of a plane, en route from Athens to Vilnius, in Minsk is an 
impertinent attack that posed threat to people's lives and violated the norms of international law, Lithuania's State 
Security Department says.
"The SSD considers the forced landing of a civilian aircraft with Lithuanian citizens and citizens of other countries in 
Minsk to be an impertinent attack that poses threat to people's lives and violated international legal norms," the 
SSD said in a comment sent to BNS.
"The SSD continues to work with other state institutions and international partners to collect all possible and 
trustworthy information about the Belarusian regime's caused very grave incident, is assessing information and 
providing it to decision-makers and is also performing all functions entrusted to the department by law," the 
department said.
The Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian airspace and 
was diverted to Minsk where it landed on Sunday afternoon.
The airline said the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers 
of "a potential security threat on board" but "nothing untoward was found).
Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the Nexta information channel Raman Pratasevich was 
detained after the plane landed in Minsk, alongside his girlfriend Sophia Sapega, a Russian citizen and student of 
the Vilnius-based European Humanities University.
Last year, Belarus put Pratasevich, 26, and Sciapan Pucila, 22, a co-founder of the Nexta channel, on the list of 
persons engaged in terrorist activity and also declared the channel to be extremist and ordered to block it.

Baltic leaders condemn forced plane landing in Minsk
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – The Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian presidents have condemned the forced landing of a 
Ryanair passenger plane in Minsk on Sunday.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda on Monday discussed the Sunday incident during his remote meeting with 
Latvian President Egils Levits and Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid, the Lithuanian presidential office said.
"The Belarusian regime grossly violated international law and risked the lives of more than one hundred people. 
This state-backed terror attack posed threat to the safety of international civil aviation, and we must respond 
accordingly," Nauseda was quoted as saying in a statement.
The Lithuanian president urged his Latvian and Estonian counterparts to jointly seek a common EU and NATO 
response to actions of the Belarusian regime.
The three Baltic leaders agreed to demand that the Belarusian regime respected Raman Pratasevich's rights and 
released him immediately, the statement reads.
According to the Lithuanian president, the airspace above Belarus should be declared unsafe and planes of this 
country should not be allowed to enter the EU airspace. An independent international probe into the unprecedented 
plane hijacking should also be carried out.
The Ryanair flight en route from Athens to Vilnius changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian airspace and 
was diverted to Minsk where it landed on Sunday afternoon.
The airline said the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers 
of "a potential security threat on board" but "nothing untoward was found).

Lithuanian police question several dozen people in forced flight diversion probe (expands)
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS –  Lithuanian law-enforcement officials have questioned several dozen people in their 
investigation into Sunday's forced grounding of a Ryanair flight by Belarus and are now inspecting the aircraft at 
Vilnius Airport.
"The plane is currently being inspected at the airport, which may take until the evening," Rolandas Kiskis, head of 
the Criminal Police Bureau, told reporters on Monday.
"We've already questioned several dozen people who were aboard the flight, including crew members."
Those questioned include the captain of the aircraft who "made the decision [to change course to Minsk] after 
consulting Ryanair's management", according to Kiskis.
A total of 126 passengers were aboard the flight from Athens, but only 121 of them arrived in Vilnius after the forced 
landing to Minsk, he said.
Deputy Prosecutor General Gintas Ivanauskas added that publicly available information about the incident is close 
to what actually happened.
"We can't say that the information circulating in the public fully corresponds to what is being established during the 
investigation, but to a large extent, it does," he told the news conference.
An investigation of this scale is likely to take quite a long time, according to the prosecutor.

Lithuanian citizens strongly advised against travel to Belarus – ministry
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Lithuanian citizens are strongly advised against traveling to Belarus and those who are 
currently in the neighboring country are urged to leave it, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday.
The recommendation came after a Vilnius-bound Ryanair flight from Athens was forcibly diverted to Minsk on 
Sunday.
Belarus’ forced diversion of the flight posed "risks to the security and a threat to the lives of civilians", the ministry 
said in a statement.
Therefore, it "strongly recommends Lithuanian citizens against all travel to the Republic of Belarus and urges all 
Lithuanian citizens in Belarus to leave the country".
According to the Irish airline, the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air 
traffic controllers of "a potential security threat on board", but "nothing untoward" was found.
Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and co-founder of the Telegram channel Nexta, was

Wizz Air, airBaltic shun Belarusian airspace
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Hungarian and Latvian airlines Wizz Air and airBaltic have confirmed they are diverting 
their planes away from Belarus' airspace. The move comes in response to Sunday's incident when a Ryanair 
passenger plane en route from Athens to Vilnius was diverted and forced to land in Minsk.
Alise Briede, dead of corporate communication at airBaltic, says the airline decided to avoid the Belarusian airspace 
for flights from Riga to Odessa and Tbilisi in response to the EU Aviation Safety Agency's recommendation to 
operate cautiously in Minsk and above it.
"Yesterday when mixed information was received about the diverted commercial flight to Minsk, as an immediate 
action, airBaltic decided to avoid entering Belarus' airspace until the situation becomes clearer or a decision is 
issued by the authorities," Briede told BNS, adding that the airline is closely watching the situation.
Andras Rado, corporate communications manager at Wizz Air, also told BNS that the airline's planes flying from 
Kiev to Tallinn were also avoiding the Belarusian airspace, and the company continues to watch the situation.
"I can confirm that today’s KIEV-TLL (the Kiev-Tallinn flight) has been rerouted and we are continuously monitoring 
and evaluating the situation," he said.
The airlines could not say yet whether flights would be further diverted to the airspaces of other countries.
Ryanair's Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted to Minsk and held for several hours there
on Sunday afternoon. The plane was close to the Lithuanian airspace but was forced to divert to the Belarusian 
capital. Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the Nexta information channel, 
was on the plane and was detained after landing in Minsk alongside his female friend and another four persons.

Belarusian Foreign Ministry summons Latvian ambassador
RIGA, May 24, BNS - Latvian Ambassador to Belarus Einars Seimanis on Monday was summoned to the 
Belarussian Foreign Ministry, Janis Bekeris, press secretary of the Latvian Foreign Ministry, informed BNS.
As BNS reported, Belarus' historical white-red-white flag was on Monday flown alongside the national flags of other 
nations participating in the Ice Hockey World Championship in Riga.
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) and Riga Mayor Martins Stakis (For/Progressives) replaced 
Belarus' official flag with the white-red-white standard at the Radisson Blu Hotel Latvija where the Belarussian 
national ice hockey team is accommodated during the tournament.
Stakis said that the gesture was Riga City Council's initiative, backed by Belarus' opposition and intended to 
express support for the people who are suffering under the regime of Belarusian authoritarian leader Alexander 
Lukashenko.
"Riga is demonstrating solidarity with Belarus' people, opposition and refugees. For a free Belarus!" Stakis said at 
the event.
Rinkevics indicated that sanctions and statements are one thing, but this step - replacing the flag - is stronger as a 
symbolic act.
The Latvian foreign minister added that the replacing of Belarus' official flag with the white-red-white one also 
shows Latvia's attitude to the Belarusian authorities' 'act of terror' - the forced landing of a passenger flight to arrest 
an opposition journalist.

Rinkevics also voiced hope that the meeting of EU leaders, which is taking place in Brussels, will result in an 
agreement on member states' joint response to Belarus' actions - the hijacking of a Ryanair plane and capturing 
one of its passengers, opposition activist and journalist Raman Pratasevich.
As the Latvian foreign minister told BNS, by replacing Belarus' official flag with the historical white-red-white flag 
Latvia shows that it cannot and will not support the Belarusian authorities' crackdown on opposition activists.
He also noted that the hijacking of the Ryanair flight and capture of Protasevich and his girlfriend is a violation of 
international law and that such operations pose threats to civilian air traffic, passengers and Protasevich, who had 
found refuge in a foreign country from reprisals in Belarus.
The foreign minister also said that Riga entrusted with hosting the ice hockey championship after the events that 
shook Belarus last year and that the change of flags was a symbolic demonstration that Latvia is with the 
Belarusian people and not with Lukashenko's regime.

Russian consul refuses to help Russian student held in Minsk – Tsikhanouskaya
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Russia's consul has refused to provide assistance to Sofia Sapega, a Russian national 
detained after her Vilnius-bound flight from Athens was forced to land in Minsk on Sunday, Belarus' exiled 
opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Monday.
"It's the second day since Raman Pratasevich was arrested, and we still don’t know where he is or how he is. It's 
highly probable that he's now being tortured by members of the special services," Tsikhanouskaya told a news 
conference in Vilnius.
"His girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, was detained along with him. She's 23; she was aboard the same flight. We know 
from her relatives that she was taken to Okrestina [detention center in Minsk]," she said. "Sofia is a Russian citizen, 
and human rights activists say that the Russian consul has refused to help her."
Tsikhanouskaya added that they did not know yet what charges had been brought against Sofia, who is a student of 
Vilnius-based European Humanities University.
The opposition leader said she was keeping in touch with the parents of Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition 
activist, blogger and co-founder of the Telegram channel Nexta who was arrested in Minsk on Sunday. However, 
neither his parents nor a lawyer hired by them know where he is being held.
"In Belarus, it takes several days for relatives to find out where their family member is," she said.
Sunday's forced landing of the Ryanair flight in Minsk showed that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and 
his regime pose a threat not only to Belarusians, according to Tsikhanouskaya
Russian consul refuses to help Russian student held in Minsk – Tsikhanouskaya
"Now everyone understands that it's not just Belarusians who are under threat; an act of state terrorism has been 
committed. Any passenger on a plane flying over Belarus will be in danger now. The regime has turned our country 
into North Korea in the middle of Europe," she said.
Tsikhanouskaya said she was keeping in touch with EU and US politicians.
"We demand new sanctions, the exclusion of Belarus from the International Civil Aviation Organization and the 
opening of an investigation so that all those responsible are punished," she said.
"We are also asking for the suspension of Belarus' membership in Interpol, because the regime is using its 
membership in for its political purposes."
The Ryanair flight, scheduled to arrive in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, was forced to change course just before 
crossing into Lithuanian airspace.
According to the Irish airline, the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air 
traffic controllers of "a potential security threat on board", but "nothing untoward" was found.
Belarus scrambled a fighter jet and a military helicopter to force the civilian flight to land in its capital.
Last year, Minsk put Pratasevich, 26, and Sciapan Pucila, a 22-year-old co-founder of the Nexta channel, on the list 
of "individuals involved in terrorist activity", and declared the channel "extremist" and ordered it blocked.

Joint decision of whole government needed on Belarus situation - Linkaits
RIGA, May 24, BNS - The decision on Latvia's further steps regarding the situation with Belarus and the hijacking of 
the Ryanair plane should be taken by the whole government, Transport Minister Talis Linkaits (New Conservative 
Party) told BNS, commenting on Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics' (New Unity) calls to ban Latvia-registered 
carriers from using Belarusian airspace and to suspend cooperation with Belarusian airlines.
The Transport Ministry is in the process of drafting a resolution, which will be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers.
BNS was told at the ministry that representatives of the Civil Aviation Agency (CAA) and the Transport Ministry are 
closely following the situation, including other European countries' response, at the same time keeping in touch with 
Latvian carriers, other state authorities and international organizations,  as well as coordinating their actions with 
the Foreign Ministry.
The CAA is obtaining the necessary information and consulting with national and international partners to assess 
the circumstances of the incident in Minsk. Latvian airlines have stopped using Belarusian airspace already since 
Sunday.
As reported, responding to the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger flight in Minsk last Sunday, Latvian Foreign 
Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) on Monday called on Transport Minister Talis Linkaits (New Conservative 
Party) to ban Latvian-registered carriers from using Belarussian airspace.
The foreign minister said that in view of the incident, the airspace over Belarus cannot be considered safe, and "we 
cannot permit our passengers to run such a risk". Rinkevics also called for halting cooperation with Belarusian 
carriers, including, in particular, the national airline Belavia.
On 23 May, the Belarusian authorities ordered a fighter jet to force a Ryanair civilian flight FR 4978 to perform an 
emergency landing at Minsk National Airport so that an independent journalist and opposition activist from Belarus,

Raman Pratasevich, could be detained. Alongside other Western countries, Latvia calls for an immediate release of

airBaltic to avoid Belarus airspace in nearest time
RIGA, May 24, BNS - Latvian national carrier airBaltic in the nearest time will avoid overflight on Belarus due to the 
recent incidence with intercepted Ryanair aircraft, according to the information published by the company.
The airline on Sunday decided to route Riga-Odessa and Riga-Tbilisi flights so that they should not fly over Belarus, 
based on recommendations of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
"Safety and health of our passengers is our main priority. Currently airBaltic continues to closely monitor the 
situation," the airline said.
As reported, the Ryanair flight, scheduled to arrive from Athens in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, changed course just 
before crossing into Lithuanian airspace.
The airline said the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers 
of "a potential security threat on board".
Belarus' opposition say that the flight was forced to land in Minsk to arrest one of its passengers, opposition activist 
and journalist Raman Pratasevich.
According to Lithuania's authorities, 171 passengers were aboard the Ryanair flight, including 94 Lithuanian, 11 
Greek and nine French nationals, and a number of citizens of Belarus, Poland, Romania, Germany, Latvia, Russia, 
Georgia and other countries.
The flight returned from Minsk to Vilnius on Sunday evening.

airBaltic said on Twitter that the carrier will avoid entering Belarusian airspace for the next flights on May 25 from 
Riga to Athens and Heraklion.

Head of Lithuanian association 'baffled' by Ryanair decision to keep flying over Belarus
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Joris Gintilas, head of the Lithuanian National Aviation Association (LAVIA), said on 
Monday that he was "baffled" by Ryanair's decision to allow its flights to continue flying via Belarusian airspace in 
the wake of Sunday's incident.
"I'm baffled. After the latest statement by their CEO that this was an act of state-sponsored aviation piracy, they 
make the decision to continue to operate flights," Gintilas told BNS.
"I'd attribute this to corporate inertia. [The airline continues flights over Belarus] despite the management describing 
the situation quite categorically as unacceptable and a threat to the safety of both passengers and aircraft. Frankly, 
I don't quite understand that," he said.
Hungary's Wizz Air, Latvia's Air Baltic and Lithuanian-owned Avia Solutions Group, which operates charter flights, 
said earlier on Monday that they were rerouting flights to avoid Belarusian airspace.
Flights bypassing Belarus may cost airlines more and take longer, but Gintilas does not think that Ryanair's 
decision is due to rising costs.
"Ryanair is operating few flights via Belarusian airspace," he said. "Other airlines will feel the cost of making a 
detour more than such a giant would. It's definitely not a matter of costs."
An EU-wide decision to restrict flights via Belarusian airspace would deal a severe blow to the neighboring country's 
air navigation service provider, according to Gintilas.
"Restricting Belarus' transit airspace would have a bigger impact than restricting flights to Belarus, because foreign 
airlines operate few flights to Belarus. Only Belavia is operating more of them," he said.

The government has prohibited any flights to or from Lithuanian airports via Belarusian airspace as of midnight on 
Tuesday, meaning that all airlines operating in Lithuania will have to reroute their flights. The ban will not apply to 
overflights via Lithuanian airspace.

Estonian ForMin summons Belarusian ambassador over forced landing, arrest of journalist
TALLINN,  May 24, BNS - The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday summoned the ambassador of 
Belarus, Vyacheslav Kachanov, to protest the forced landing of a civilian flight of Ryanair in Minsk and the arrest of 
Belarusian opposition activist Raman Pratasevich.
The plane carrying nationals of several European states was heading to Vilnius from Athens when, using a bomb 
threat and military force, it was diverted to Minsk and Raman Pratasevich, a member of the Belarusian opposition 
who was onboard the flight, was subsequently arrested, spokespeople for the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
said.
"These steps by the Belarusian regime endangered air traffic and the lives of passengers and flight crew. This kind 
of action is completely unacceptable and an investigation into all circumstances of this event must be carried out 
immediately. The journalist and his companion who were arrested after the plane was forced to land must be 
released immediately, and they must be allowed to leave Belarus if they desire," the ministry said.
Estonia considers this kind of action unacceptable, as it clearly violates international law. The international 
community must respond to this grave violation of international law, and Estonia has started consultations at the UN 
Security Council to raise this incident at the Security Council.
The Estonian ministry also expressed great regret over the death of Belarusian political prisoner Vitold Ashurak.
Ashurak, who died in a penal colony the day before yesterday, was charged with attending a peaceful 
demonstration on Aug. 9 of last year. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also condemned the blocking of Belarus' 
largest news portal Tut.by.

Estonia-Belarus parlt group condemns Minsk's forcing of plane to land
TALLINN, May 24, BNS – The group for interparliamentary ties with Belarus in the Estonian parliament issued a 
statement on Monday in which it condemns the actions of the authorities of Belarus by which a passenger plane 
was forced to land in Minsk and Belarus opposition politician Raman Pratasevich was detained.
"The Riigikogu Estonia-Belarus parliament group condemns yet another action in violation of human rights by the 
Belarus authorities, in the course of which a Ryanair flight bound from Athens to Vilnius without stops en route was 
forced to land in Minsk on May 23, and the subsequent detention of opposition politician Raman Pratasevich at the 
airport. We also condemn the detention of the spouse of Raman Pratasevich in Belarus," the statement reads.
According to the statement, the Estonia-Belarus parliament group clearly considers that the Lukashenko regime has 
once again ignored international law and freedom of the press, and, using extreme measures, continues to silence 
opposition voices. The behavior of the Belarus authorities cannot be tolerated, it said.
"We request the government of the Republic of Estonia to give a clear position and signal at the forthcoming 
European Council on the possible imposition of sanctions against the Belarusian regime. We also call on all free 
and democratic states to state clearly their positions to deplore the actions of the Belarusian authorities and to 
impose possible sanctions to condemn such actions," the statement says.
The statement has been signed by MPs Igor Kravtsenko, Sven Sester, Dmitri Dmitrijev, Maria Jufereva-Skuratovski, 
Mihhail Korb, Siret Kotka, Kalvi Kova, Aadu Must and Paul Puustusmaa.

Foreign minister calls for steering clear of Belarusian airspace and halting cooperation with Belarusian airlines
RIGA, May 24, BNS - Responding to the forced landing of a Ryanair passenger flight in Minsk last Sunday, Latvian 
Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (New Unity) on Monday called on Transport Minister Talis Linkaits (New 
Conservative Party) to ban Latvian-registered carriers from using Belarussian airspace.
The foreign minister said that in view of the incident, the airspace over Belarus cannot be considered safe, and "we 
cannot permit our passengers to run such a risk". Rinkevics also called for halting cooperation with Belarusian 
carriers, including, in particular, the national airline Belavia.
At the same time, European Union (EU) member states will continue coordinating their actions in order to adopt a 
common decision, including possible measures against the Belarusian officials responsible for the incident.
On 23 May, the Belarusian authorities ordered a fighter jet to force a Ryanair civilian flight FR 4978 to perform an 
emergency landing at Minsk National Airport so that an independent journalist and opposition activist from Belarus, 
Raman Pratasevich, could be detained. Alongside other Western countries, Latvia calls for an immediate release of 
the Belarusian activist and to fully guarantee his rights.

Lithuania's Avia Solutions Group reroutes flights to avoid Belarusian airspace
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Avia Solutions Group (ASG), a global aerospace business group controlled by Lithuanian 
businessman Gediminas Ziemelis, has decided to reroute its flights to avoid Belarusian airspace after the 
neighboring country's military aircraft forced a Vilnius-bound Ryanair flight from Athens to land in Minks.
"The main priorities of our air carriers are safe flights and passenger safety, therefore the group companies, 
assessing the situation and in the absence of official explanations, will change flight routes to bypass Belarusian 
airspace," ASG posted on Facebook on Monday.
The group said its companies – the charter airline KlasJet and the ACMI and aircraft leasing operator Avion 
Express – "closely monitor the situation and are waiting for instructions and assessments of the competent civil 
aviation authorities regarding the organization of flights".
Hungary's Wizz Air and Latvia's Air Baltic have also confirmed that they are avoiding Belarusian airspace on 
Monday.
Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the Telegram channel Nexta, was 
arrested after the diverted Ryanair flight landed in Minsk.

Lithuanian president to attend EU summit to discuss new sanctions for Belarus
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda will on Monday attend a special meeting of the 
European Council where the issue of new sanctions for Belarus should be raised.
On the eve of the meeting, European Council President Charles Michel said the issue of sanctions would be put on 
the meeting's agenda after a Ryanair passenger plane en route from Athens to Vilnius was forced to land in Minsk.
In his words, EU leaders will discuss the unprecedented incident during the European Council, adding that the 
incident will not remain without consequences.
Lithuanian leaders and leaders of other EU countries also spoke about "very serious sanctions" for the Lukashenko 
regime on Sunday.
Ryanair's Athens-to-Vilnius flight was diverted to Minsk and held for several hours there
on Sunday afternoon. The plane was close to the Lithuanian airspace but was forced to divert to the Belarusian 
capital.
Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the Nexta information channel, was on the 
plane and was detained after landing in Minsk.
Based on the information available to Lithuania, there were 171 passengers on the plane and they included 94 
Lithuanian citizens, as well as 11 Greek nationals, nine French citizens, and also several citizens of Belarus, 
Poland, Romania, Germany, Latvia, Russia, Georgia etc.
The plane retuned to Vilnius on Sunday night without Pratasevich, his friend and another four people.

Belarus used a fighter jet and a military helicopter to force the plane to land.
The Lithuanian president and the foreign minister called the incident a state terror act and Lithuania's Prosecutor 
general's Officer has launched a pre-trial investigation into a plane highjacking.
Nauseda said on Sunday he would raise the issue of recognizing the Belarusian airspace unsafe for civil aviation, 
and also for planes of Belarusian airline Belavia to lose the right to and at airports in EU and NATO countries.
The European Council's special meeting on Monday had been called to discuss climate change and relations with 
Russia.
Last week, Nauseda took part in a remote preparatory meeting for the special European Council and said that 
Lithuania supported the EU’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 and 
transitioning to a climate neutral economy by 2050.
According to the president, the delivery of these ambitious goals requires fair distribution of efforts within the EU 
and adequate funding.
In terms of the EU's relations with Russia, Lithuania is seeking sectoral and individual sanctions for Russia. But the 
planned comprehensive discussion on relation with Russia could be postponed until the next European Council.
EU leaders also plan to discuss ways to control the coronavirus pandemic, the position on the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict and relations with the United Kingdom.
The European Council meeting will take place in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.

Estonian Association of Journalists demands release of Belarus journalist Pratasevich
TALLINN, May 24, BNS – The Estonian Association of Journalists supports the demand of the European 
Federation of Journalists (EFJ) for the authorities of Belarus to immediately release  journalist Raman Pratasevich, 
who was abducted at Minsk airport on Sunday, along with the other 28 journalists currently in custody in that 
country.
The EFJ earlier on Monday called for an official international mission to meet with the 29 detained journalists and 
launch an international investigation to punish all those involved in the repression of journalists and media in 
Belarus. The political authorities, law enforcement agencies and the judiciary in Belarus must be held accountable, 
it said.
The EFJ and its affiliates, including the Estonian Association of Journalists, are ready to collaborate in this 
investigation.
The Estonian Association of Journalists calls also on politicians, the government and the president of Estonia to 
step up pressure on the authorities of Belarus.
"Estonia has been driving the topic of Belarus at the UN and it should not remain on the background also now, 
when the Belarus authorities have arrested a pro-opposition journalist by employing means of fraud and piracy," 
said the chairperson of the Estonian Association of Journalists, Helle Tiikmaa.
On Sunday, the Belarusian authorities forced a civilian plane to perform an emergency landing in Minsk. The 
Ryanair passenger plane, flying between Greece and Lithuania, was forced to land by a Belarusian military aircraft. 
One of the passengers onboard, Belarusian journalist Raman Pratasevich, was detained by the Belarusian 
authorities and prevented from boarding the plane at the Minsk airport to its original destination.
Estonian Association of Journalists demands release of Belarus journalist Pratasevich
The EFJ denounces this as an act of air piracy and state terrorism, in that a passenger plane flying on an internal 
EU route was forced to land outside the EU by military means and an internal EU passenger was forced to leave 
the aircraft, and demands the immediate release of Raman Pratasevich and the 28 other journalists currently 
detained in Belarus.
EFJ President Mogens Blicher Bjerregard said that every week, the EFJ denounces, together with its Belarusian 
affiliate BAJ, the increasing repression of human rights and press freedom in Belarus.
"In a few days, the number of journalists behind bars has almost doubled. Sunday's act of state terrorism was 
predictable and we regret that the international community did not take our calls for action against dictator 
Lukashenko seriously," Bjerregard said.
EFJ General Secretary Ricardo Gutierrez said the EFJ calls on the European Union, the Council of Europe and the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to take measures against dictator Lukashenko and 
those responsible for the repression of press freedom and human rights.

Belarus' opposition activist urges intl community to list Lukashenko as terrorist
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – One of Belarusian opposition leaders said on Monday that recent events show that 
Belarus is ruled by a "military junta", calling on the international community to list Alexander Lukashenko as an 
international terrorist and his regime as a terrorist organization.
"I believe that the international community [...] must designate Lukashenko and his regime as being terrorist," Pavel 
Latushka, Belarus' former culture minister and a member of the Belarusian opposition's Coordination Council, told 
BNS in an interview.
"That will restrict absolutely all contacts, financial and trade cooperation; this will not allow Russia to continue 
supporting Lukashenko. We need this decision," he said.
Latushka, a former long-time Belarusian diplomat, took the side of protesters against the rigged presidential election 
last year and now lives in Warsaw.
There are many indications that Sunday's interception of Ryanair's flight from Athens to Vilnius and its forced 
landing in Minsk under false pretense of a security threat was an operation orchestrated by the regime, according to 
the opposition activist.
"The pilot, of course, had no choice but to obey, because he was threatened by a military aircraft armed with air-to-
air missiles. The nearest airport was in Vilnius; he could have started landing there, but was forced to obey the 
military plane," he said.
"We received that information yesterday from a foreign civil aviation service, as well as from our own sources at the 
Belarusian Ministry of Defense. Unfortunately, this proves once again that there is a military junta in Belarus and 
that the country is ruled by an international terrorist."
Belarus' opposition activist urges intl community to list Lukashenko as terrorist
The arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and co-founder of the Telegram channel 
Nexta, proves that the regime is moving from threats to a real crackdown on foreign-based opposition activists, 
according to Latushka.
Inside Belarus, 36 people were sentenced to eight to eleven years in prison for political reasons last week alone, he 
said.
The former diplomat said he was grateful to Lithuanian leaders for "their very clear position", adding that "a 
coordinated position of all EU countries is very important, too".
"We hope that in the near future, a real, substantial package of sanctions will be introduced, that a decision will be 
made to close Belarus' airspace pending the completion of the investigation into the incident, and that more urgent 
steps will be taken to designate Lukashenko as an international terrorist," he said.
Based on unconfirmed information, Pratasevich is currently being interrogated in a detention center of Belarus' 
KGB, he said.
Sunday's events and Belarus' worsening economic situation may become a trigger for new protests, but they are 
hampered by the regime's measures and the blocking of independent media, the opposition activist said.
Latushka has in the past served as Belarus' culture minister and its ambassador to Poland and France. The regime 
has put him on the list of "organizations and individuals involved in terrorist activity".
Latushka was among the first high-ranking Belarusian officials to publicly oppose the violent crackdown on protests 
in Minsk in the wake of last August's presidential election. He was fired as director of the Janka Kupala National 
Theater in August.

Estonian president: Belarusian airspace must be closed
TALLINN, May 24, BNS - During a video meeting with Latvian President Egils Levits and Lithuanian President 
Gitanas Nauseda on Monday morning, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid emphasized that the airspace of Belarus 
should be closed after Sunday's incident.
The aim of the meeting was to discuss joint steps to put pressure on Belarus in the aftermath of Sunday's hijacking, 
both in the framework of the European Union and the United Nations. The three heads of state jointly called for the 
release of the hijacked persons, closure of Belarusian airspace, and effective sanctions, spokespeople for the 
Estonian president said.
The working meeting called by the Estonian president was aimed to discuss potential counter moves and 
harmonize positions in reaction to the events that took place in Belarus on Sunday.
"An act of undisguised state terror, the hijacking of an aircraft, is something new even in the arsenal of experienced 
dictators. The rest of the world must stop treating the Belarus regime with kid gloves, and we must use all peaceful 
means that we have to put pressure on that regime. Yesterday's incident, by which the lives of 171 passengers 
were put at risk and which resulted in at least two people being abducted from the plane, must not go unpunished," 
Kaljulaid said after the meeting with her Baltic colleagues.
According to the presidents of the three Baltic countries, the passengers abducted from the flight must be released 
immediately, the airspace of Belarus must be closed for international flights and air links with Belarus terminated, 
and strong and effective sanctions must be imposed at the European Union level on the organizers of the terrorist 
act and on the Belarusian regime.
"Unfortunately, no citizen of the European Union can consider Belarus to be a safe area any longer, either on land 
or in the air. That is why I also consider it reasonable to stop all transit through Belarus. As always, sanctions 
Estonian president: Belarusian airspace must be closed
inevitably have an impact also on the member states of the European Union, our businesses and people, but we 
must not put people's lives at risk. Yesterday showed that this threat is real," the Estonian head of state said.
As a member of the UN Security Council, Estonia plans to initiate a discussion at the Security Council on Sunday's 
events in Belarus at the earliest opportunity.
On Monday, the same topics were to be discussed by EU heads of government at a meeting of the European 
Council in Brussels.
A Ryanair plane that had taken off from Athens for a flight to Vilnius on Sunday was forces by  Belarusian 
authorities to turn back before crossing the Lithuanian border and make an emergency landing in Minsk. After the 
landing, Raman Pratasevich, an opposition activist and journalist who was onboard the flight, was detained. There 
were altogether 171 passengers onboard the flight, over half of them from Lithuania. The passengers also included 
citizens of  Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Spain, France, Georgia, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Belarus 
and Syria.

Parlt committees condemn threats of violence against civilian aircraft flying over Belarus
TALLINN, May 24, BNS – Chairs of foreign affairs committees of the Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Czech, German, 
Polish, US, Irish, and UK parliaments made a joint statement calling for the immediate and unconditional release of 
Roman Protasevich and for putting sanctions on the Lukashenka regime.
"We, the chairs of our respective national parliaments' foreign affairs committees, condemn unequivocally the threat 
of violence used against a civilian aircraft in the skies over Belarus. Using fighter aircraft to intercept a civilian 
Ryanair flight is an act of piracy on a route between two NATO and EU countries. This reckless act put the 
passengers and crew in grave danger. It is a reminder of the illegitimacy of the administration claiming authority in 
Minsk," it is said in the statement.
The chairs of the foreign affairs committees call for an immediate inquiry to be held by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO) into this clear violation of free transit between states and the threats to the aircraft.
"Until ICAO has reported, we call for Belarus to be suspended from the organization and a ban on all overflight of 
Belarus including flights to and from the country. It is clear that the current administration in Minsk has no respect 
for the safety of our citizens and cannot be trusted to defend their rights. This act of state terror and kidnapping is a 
threat to all those who travel in Europe and beyond. It cannot be allowed to stand," the representatives of the 
parliaments of the nine countries said.
"We call on NATO and European Union states to put sanctions on the Lukashenka regime and suspend their ability 
to use Interpol and other international organizations to further attack democracy in Europe. We call for free 
elections to be held under the supervision of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We call for 
the immediate and unconditional release of Roman Protasevich and all other political prisoners," it is said in the 
statement.
Parlt committees condemn threats of violence against civilian aircraft flying over Belarus
"Tyranny has no place in Belarus or in Europe. It threatens not only its own citizens but millions of others around 
the world," the chairs of the foreign affairs committees said.

Lithuanian intermin turns to Interpol over plane's diversion to Minsk
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Lithuanian Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite has on Monday turned to Interpol over 
Sunday's forced diversion of a passenger plane to Minsk.
According to the Interior Ministry, the move is aimed at attracting attention to actions of non-democratic regimes 
when all available measures are used to crack down on political opponents.
In her letter to Interpol's secretary general, the minister stressed the need for an in-depth assessment of inquiries 
made via Interpol to protect people persecuted for political motives.
"We must do everything possible for international legal instruments not to be used for persecution and repressions. 
We are speaking not only about the January 13 events and the safety of the judges involved in this case. People 
are being persecuted in Lithuania's neighborhood, and yesterday's event when a private company plane was forced 
to land at Minsk Airport and a journalist was detained, raises major concern for the safety of people," Bilotaite was 
quoted as saying in a statement.
Over 35,000 people have been detained in Belarus since the non-democratic presidential election in 2020 for taking 
part in peaceful protests, according to information available to the Interior Ministry.
To prevent countries ruled by non-democratic regimes from using Interpol's inquiries for future unlawful persecution 
for political motives, Lithuania is asking the European Commission to carry out an analysis into the existing legal 
regulation and practice in EU member states and is proposing looking for a pan-EU solution of this issue.
Lithuania seeks creation of a common EU system to exchange information on regime-persecuted people for them 
to at least feel safe in the EU.

Ryanair waits for EU, NATO decisions on flights over Belarus
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – Ryanair, whose Vilnius-bound flight was forcibly diverted to Minsk on Sunday, said on 
Monday that it was waiting for decisions by the EU and NATO bodies on flights over Belarusian airspace.

airspace.
"Ryanair condemns the unlawful actions of Belarusian authorities who diverted Ryanair's flight FR4978 to Minsk 
yesterday (23 May), which was an act of aviation piracy," the Irish airline told BNS.
"This is now being dealt with by EU safety and security agencies & NATO. Ryanair is fully cooperating with them 
and we cannot comment further for security reasons," it added.
The flight tracking website Flightradar24 showed that a Ryanair flight from Cyprus to Tallinn was flying over Belarus 
on Monday.
Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian opposition activist, blogger and founder of the Telegram channel Nexta, was 
arrested after the diverted Ryanair flight landed in Minsk.

Estonian PM: Intl investigation must be launched into flight diversion by Belarus
TALLINN, May 24, BNS - Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said that an international investigation must be 
launched into the diversion of a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius and the arrest of journalist Roman Protasevich 
by Belarusian authorities.
Belarusian opposition activist and blogger Roman Protasevich, 26, was onboard the Ryanair FR4978 flight with 170 
other passengers traveling between Greece and Lithuania and was arrested upon landing in Minsk.
"Absolutely inexplicable and shocking reports from Belarus about detaining Roman Protasevich and forcing the 
Ryanair plane to land," the prime minister wrote on social media on Sunday.
"All passengers should be immediately released and a thorough international investigation should follow," she 
added.
Kallas said that this is not just a threat to international civil aviation, but a state-initiated abduction that must have 
consequences. "Tomorrow, we will discuss the incident with the leaders of the European Union at a Council 
meeting," the Prime Minister said on Sunday.

VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – The government has banned flights arriving in or departing from Lithuania from flying over 
Belarusian airspace.
The ban takes effect at 00:00 UTC (3 a.m. Vilnius time) on May 25.
The decision comes a day after Belarus forced a Vilnius-bound Ryanair flight from Athens to land in Minsk.
"Yesterday's incident made it very clear that, unfortunately, even our citizens are unsafe while flying over the 
neighboring country's airspace, and we can't be sure that an aircraft won't be forced to land for one reason or 
another," Transport Minister Marius Skuodis told the Cabinet.
The government instructed Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation), the state-owned air navigation service provider, to 
inform pilots about the ban.

Vilnius-bound plane hijacked by Lukashenko regime – Tsikhanouskaya's advisor
VILNIUS, May 23, BNS – Alexander Lukashenko's regime on Sunday hijacked a Vilnius-bound flight from Athens, 
acting like "Somali pirates" in violation of all international aviation rules, an advisor to Belarus' exiled opposition 
leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said.
"Belarusian journalist Raman Pratasevich flew from Athens to Vilnius on the same flight as Tsikhanouskaya a week 
ago," Franak Viacorka told BNS.
If Tsikhanouskaya had been on the plane, she would have been detained, too, according to the advisor.
"They scrambled a MiG-29 military fighter jet. The Belarusian dispatcher instructed the plane to change course and 
fly to Minsk Airport, purportedly due to a threat of explosives," he said.
"In Minsk, a repeated check of passengers was carried out, the aircraft was inspected, and Pratasevich was 
detained as passengers were disembarking from the plane."
Pratasevich, an editor of the information channel Nexta and many other Belarusian information channels, was 
detained by the criminal police in Minsk, Viacorka said.
Belarus violated all international civil aviation rules and procedures by using a military fighter jet to intercept a 
passenger plane, according to the advisor.
"They hijacked the plane like Somali pirates," he said.
Belarus' media reported that it was Lukashenko's personal decision to ground the Ryanair plane.

Belarus opposition leader in Vilnius: Lukashenko used military aviation to arrest one man
VILNIUS, May 23, BNS – Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's impunity allowed him to use military aircraft 
to arrest one person, Belarus' exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Sunday.
"The time for statements is over," she told reporters in Vilnius. "It's obvious that Belarusians now need decisive 
action and assistance from the international community."
"Political prisoner [Vitold) Ashurok's death in prison, the destruction of TUT.by [news agency] and the hijacking of 
the plane are all the result of the impunity on which the regime bases its internal occupation."
"No one in the world is guaranteed safety while flying over Belarus now. Today Lukashenko personally triggered an 
international scandal by using military aviation against citizens of Belarus and European countries to crack down on 
just one person. No one is protected anymore. Anyone can be in Raman Pratasevich's place."
Tsikhanouskaya was commenting on Belarus' diversion earlier on Sunday of a Vilnius-bound flight from Athens to 
detain Belarusian opposition activist and blogger Raman Pratasevich.
"A week ago, I myself took the same flight from Athens. I met Raman Pratasevich in Greece; he was photographing 
our working visit," the opposition leader said.
"Seven days later, the regime scrambled special services and fighter jets, and organized the hijacking of a 
passenger plane just to take Raman hostage," she added.
According to Tsikhanouskaya, Pratasevich was forced to leave Belarus in 2019 for cooperating with the opposition 
Telegram channel Nexta.

"Raman is one of the people who help Belarusians find out the truth about what's happening. Therefore, Belarus' 
power structures have brought several criminal cases against him, and the KGB has added him to the list of 
individuals involved in terrorist activities," the opposition leader said.
"His life is in danger now," she added.
The Belarusian opposition said they have turned to Ryanair and the International Civil Aviation Organization over 
the incident, asking them to launch an investigation and consider suspending Belarus' ICAO membership.
The Foreign Ministries of Greece and Ireland, and the US administration have been informed about the forced 
grounding of the passenger plane in Minsk.

Lithuania to seek Belarus airspace closure to international flights
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS – The Lithuanian government will seek that Belarus' airspace be closed to international 
flights after the neighboring country's authorities forced a Vilnius-bound flight to land in Minsk in an "act of state 
terrorism".
"Lithuania will demand a clear and uncompromising response from the international community" to Sunday's 
diversion of the Ryanair flight, the government said in a statement.
"The airspace of Belarus is unsafe for everyone. The EU must take effective measures to protect all individuals, 
regardless of their nationality, who are at risk from inadequate actions of the regime," it said.
"Together with international partners, we will work to close the airspace of Belarus to international flights," it said. 
"What happened today is an attack not only on Lithuania; it is a signal for the entire European Union and 
international organizations."
The statement denounced Belarus' actions as an "act of state terrorism directed against the security of citizens of 
the European Union and other countries, civil society of Belarus seeking asylum from the regime’s persecution, as 
well as international civil aviation".
"It is an unprecedented attack against the international community: a civilian plane and its passengers have been 
hijacked by military force, and a Belarusian citizen has been abducted, whose life and health are in danger."
The Ryanair flight, scheduled to arrive in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, changed course just before crossing into 
Lithuanian airspace.
The airline said the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers 
of "a potential security threat on board".

"Nothing untoward was found and authorities cleared the aircraft to depart together with passengers and crew after 
approximately five hours on the ground in Minsk," it said.
Belarus' opposition say that the flight was forced to land in Minsk to arrest one of its passengers, opposition activist 
and journalist Raman Pratasevich.
According to Lithuania's authorities, 171 passengers were aboard the Ryanair flight, including 94 Lithuanian, 11 
Greek and nine French nationals, and a number of citizens of Belarus, Poland, Romania, Germany, Latvia, Russia, 
Georgia and other countries.
The flight returned from Minsk to Vilnius on Sunday evening.
Leaders of NATO, the European Commission and some EU member countries condemned the incident on Sunday.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said that "very serious sanctions" would be discussed at the EU level if 
Minsk failed to release Pratasevich.
"[These] include declaring Belarusian airspace an unsafe area for civil aviation, meaning, among other things, that 
Belavia planes would lose the right to land at EU and NATO airports," he told a news conference on Sunday 
evening.
The president said he would raise these issues at the European Council's meeting on Monday.

EU to discuss serious sanctions unless Minsk releases Pratasevich – Lithuanian president (expands)
VILNIUS, May 23, BNS – "Very serious sanctions" will be discussed at the EU level if Minsk fails to release 
Belarusian opposition activist and blogger Raman Pratasevich who was arrested at Minsk Airport on Sunday, 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said.
Nauseda said other measures could be taken against the Minsk regime, too.
"[These] include declaring Belarusian airspace an unsafe area for civil aviation, meaning, among other things, that 
Belavia planes would lose the right to land at EU and NATO airports," he told a news conference on Sunday 
evening.
The International Civil Aviation Organization must conduct a thorough investigation to "answer the question of how 
an act of state terrorism could have occurred in broad daylight", according to Nauseda.
The president said he would raise these issues at the European Council's meeting.
"Many EU states have now seen the true face of this regime and what threat it is posing not only to Belarusian civil 
society, not only to the opposition, but also to people who have nothing to do with events in Belarus," he said.
Pavel Latushka, Belarus' former culture minister and a member of the Belarusian opposition's Coordination Council, 
says he has information that Belarus' authorities threatened to use weapons to force the Ryanair crew to land in 
Minsk.
Nauseda said he had no such information, but noted that military aircraft had been scrambled.
EU to discuss serious sanctions unless Minsk releases Pratasevich – Lithuanian president (expands)
"The safety of the flight was endangered," the president said. "The aircraft had to change course, even though it 
was almost in Lithuanian airspace at that time. The plane was about to land in our capital, Vilnius."
"The aircraft had to alter its flight plan, an exceptional occurrence that is absolutely incompatible with safe civil 
aviation," he added.
'State-initiated terrorist act' 
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called the forced landing of the flight” a state-initiated terrorist 
act against the international community."
When asked if Minsk had given any official explanation about the situation, Landsbergis said that most of the 
information about what was happening had come from the aircraft’s passengers.
"We kept in touch with the passengers all day," he said. "We thank them for the information they provided and for 
their courage."
The minister said he had asked the Prosecutor General's Office to launch an investigation "into potential aircraft 
hijacking by Belarus' regime".
"The investigation would answer many questions. Today we have only by a part of it," he said.
Landsbergis noted that the Lithuanian authorities' main task on Sunday was to ensure the safe return of the flight's 
passengers to Vilnius.
He said there would be a "strict response" to Belarus' interception of the flight.
Ryanair's Athens-to-Vilnius flight that had been diverted to Minsk and held for several hours there landed in the 
Lithuanian capital's airport on Sunday evening.
The flight, scheduled to arrive in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, changed course just before crossing into Lithuanian 
airspace.
Ryanair said the flight made an emergency landing in Minsk after being notified by Belarus' air traffic controllers of 
"a potential security threat on board".
"Nothing untoward was found and authorities cleared the aircraft to depart together with passengers and crew after 
approximately five hours on the ground in Minsk," it said.
Asta Skaisgiryte, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda's chief foreign policy advisor, said that Belarus had used 
two military aircraft – a MiG-29 fighter jet and a Mi-24 helicopter – to divert the civil passenger plane to Minsk.
Belarus' opposition say that the flight was forced to land in Minsk to arrest one of its passengers, opposition activist 
and journalist Raman Pratasevich.
Lithuanian and Western leaders have demanded his immediate release.

Belarus airspace unsafe even for civilians, Lithuanian parlt speaker says
VILNIUS, May 23, BNS – Sunday's diversion of a passenger plane by Minsk shows that Belarus' airspace is unsafe 
even for civilians, Viktorija Cmilyte-Nielsen, the speaker of the Lithuanian parliament, said.
"In the wake of these actions, it becomes obvious that Belarusian airspace is no longer safe, even for civilians," she 
posted on Facebook,
"Today every effort is being taken to ensure that the passengers of the Vilnius-bound flight from Athens safely 
reach Lithuania. Tomorrow we will have to discuss how to ensure that such situations do not recur."
The Lithuanian parliamentary committees on foreign affairs and on national security and defense are holding an 
extraordinary meeting on Monday over the incident.
Cmilyte-Nielsen described Belarus as an unpredictable state.
"The detention of the journalist by such methods shows that the regime no longer abides by any international norms 
or agreements," said. "Such effrontery could be due to not believing that either the European Union or the rest of 
the democratic world will put any serious pressure on the dictator. That is why a united position is very important 
now."
The Ryanair flight, scheduled to arrive in Vilnius at 1 p.m. on Sunday, was diverted to Minsk just before crossing 
into Lithuanian airspace. Belarus' opposition say that this was done to arrest one of its passengers, opposition 
activist and journalist Raman Pratasevich.
Lithuanian leaders have demanded that all passengers be immediately released and allowed to fly to Vilnius.

Lithuania's Kaunas Airport seeking investor to expand MRO infrastructure
VILNIUS, Apr 28, BNS – Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, LTOU), the operator of Lithuania's three 
international airports, has announced an auction to lease land for expanding Kaunas Airport's aircraft maintenance, 
repair and overhaul (MRO) infrastructure.

Number of flights in Lithuanian airspace down 52 pct in Q1 – operator
VILNIUS, Apr 09, BNS – The number of flights in Lithuania's airspace went down by 52 percent to 23,600 in the first 
quarter or this year, compared to 49,200 during the same period last year, according to the latest figures from Oro 
Navigacija (Air Navigation), the state-owned air navigation service provider.
Its acting CEO Redvita Cetkauskiene says the start of the summer season in late March provides some hope for an 
increase in flight numbers.
"Positive change tendencies in the flight schedule of one of the key airspace users, Lufthansa, are encouraging. 
Similar changes from Finnair“ and airBaltic would further increase the number of transit flights via Lithuania," she 
said.
The number of transit flights via Lithuania dropped by 48 percent to 19,100 in the first quarter, mainly operated by 
Aeroflot (1,400), Rossiya Airlines (901) and Ural Airlines (878).
Four airlines led in the first quarter in terms of the so-called terminal flights, when planes flew in the Lithuanian 
airspace and took off from or landed at one of Lithuania's airports. They included airBaltic (453 flights), LOT (369), 
Wizzair (320) and Ryanair (261).
People most often flew from Lithuania to Riga (165 flights), Minsk (153) and London (138).

Riga Airport reports 91% drop in passenger numbers for Q1
RIGA, Apr 9, BNS - During the first quarter of this year, Riga International Airport received 107,727 passengers, 
which is a 91 percent slump from the same period a year ago, BNS was told at the airport.
In March 2021, Riga Airport received 33,275 passengers, which is 9,000 people more than a month before, but still 
a reduction of 86 percent as compared to March 2020. The airport's representatives noted that in the second half of 
March 2020 the Latvian government suspended almost all international air traffic. Compared to pre-crisis figures, 
passenger numbers plummeted nearly 94 percent from March 2019.
In March 2021, most passengers, or 69 percent, were flown by Latvia's airBaltic carrier. Ireland's low-costs carrier 
Ryanair flew 10 percent and German airline Lufthansa 5 percent of the passengers handled by Riga Airport. 
Transfer passengers made up 13 percent of all air passengers handled by the airport in March.

three months of this year, cargo turnover at the airport rose by 1.5 percent against the same period a year ago and 
fell 13 percent from the first three months of 2019. Reduced passenger traffic was still affecting the airport's cargo 
turnover despite  strong growth in the segment of cargo flights.

Estonia seeking to support European Commission in Ryanair case
TALLINN, Apr 01, BNS – The government at its sitting on Thursday approved Estonia's position on Irish low-cost 
airline Ryanair and the European Commission's Nordica state aid case, according to which the state wishes to 
enter the proceedings and support the Commission.
In August, the European Commission approved state aid to Estonian state-owned airline Nordica in the form of an 
increase in share capital by 22 million euros and a loan of eight million euros. Ryanair, on the other hand, 
challenged the Commission's decision to grant state aid to Nordica, government spokespeople said.
In support of its action, Ryanair has put forward four claims, the most significant of which is that the Commission 
misapplied the European Union state aid rules.
According to government spokespeople, it is important for Estonia that the General Court does not annul the 
Commission's decision to grant state aid. The state, as the owner, decided to support Nordica because it is an 
important company for the state, whose operations and liquidity were severely disrupted economically due to the 
coronavirus.

Ryanair to fly from Vilnius to Denmark's Bilund
VILNIUS, Apr 01, BNS – Irish airline Ryanair will fly from Vilnius to Bilund in Denmark from July.
Flights to Bilund, where the main headquarters of Danish toy maker Lego is situated, will take place three times a 
week, Ryanair said.

temporarily suspended all flights from Vilnius and Palanga and will only fly from Kaunas to Dublin over the next 
couple of months.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary expressed hope in early March passenger flows would teach more than two thirds of 
the usual level in the summer.

Lithuanian airports to invest EUR 10.6 mln in promotion of flights this year
VILNIUS, Mar 24, BNS – Hard hit by the coronavirus crisis, Lithuania’s airports plan to invest 10.6 million euros in 
the promotion of flights this year with the aim to restore somewhat more than 50 percent of usual passenger traffic 
by the end of the year.
“The main criteria for airline companies will be demand and intense competition. Today we see active negotiations 
between airports and air carriers and, as far as the restoration of certain routes is concerned, we see that airlines 
choose to restore flights from the European airports in general and not from one or another airport,” Aurimas 
Stikliunas, head of aviation services at Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, or LOU), the operator of Lithuania’s 
three international airports, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
According to him, new flights might differ from pre-pandemic ones. For instance, it is already known that Austrian 
Airlines will not resume flights from Lithuania this year whereas Wizz Air plans to launch flights on a new route from 
Vilnius to Santorini while Ryanair intends to offer flights to Liverpool.
Lietuvos Oro Uostai reported in January that Lithuania's three international airports last year saw their total 
passenger numbers plunge by 72 percent year-on-year to 1.8 million and flight numbers slump by 52 percent to 
30,000.
The company estimates that passenger traffic will increase to 2.7 million this year, the number of flights will reach 
approximately 30,000 and airlines will offer flights to 82 destinations.
Air carriers have already announced plans to restore flights on additional 17 routes to various European airports in 
April.

Estonia: Direct flights to 27 destinations to be available from Tallinn in summer
TALLINN, Mar 22, BNS – According to available information, direct flights to 27 destinations will be operated by 
airlines from Tallinn in the summer of 2021, Tallinn Airport said in a press release on Monday.
The summer schedule of flights, to which European aviation switches from March 28, will see flights resumed on 
several routes which used to be open round the year earlier but were  suspended in the meantime due to the health 
crisis.
The chief commercial officer (CCO) of Tallinn Airport, Eero Pargmae, said that the summer timetable this year will 
see fewer flights than usual.
"Although the epidemiological situation is not good here and also elsewhere in Europe at the moment and the 
availability of vaccines is lower than expected, we continue to forecast a gradual recovery in the numbers of 
departures and passenger numbers in the summer months,"  Pargmae said in the press release.
According to the CCO, airlines are making adjustments to their flight plans every week and are prepared to respond 
with both increased frequencies as well as the addition of new destinations when the overall situation improves and 
demand recovers.
He said that the first good news came in at the end of February, when Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS), the 
largest airline of Switzerland, announced that it will launch flights between Tallinn and Zurich on June 25.
"We've been expecting the arrival of SWISS in Estonia for a long time, and in today's situation news like this instill 
in us the belief that travel will recover soon," Pargmae said. He added that while Estonians' interest in travel to 
Switzerland and Swiss people's interest in travel to Estonia have been big, air connections have been scarce.
Estonia : Direct flights to 27 destinations to be available from Tallinn in summer
Already at the end of March, services by Wizz Air to Kiev and by Air Baltic to Berlin will be added to the timetable of 
flights.
In April, services by Air Baltic to Stockholm and Malaga, a service by Turkish Airlines to Istanbul, a service by 
Aeroflot to Moscow, a service by Wizz Air to Lviv and a service by Ryanair to Bergamo Milan will be added.
The additions to be seen in May are flights by Air Baltic to Brussels and Paris, a service by Easyjet to London, 
services to Vienna by Wizz Air and Ryanair, services to Oslo by Wizz Air and Norwegian, and services by Wizz Air 
to Kharkiv and Milan Malpensa. Also in May, Aegean will start flying to Athens and Ryanair to Berlin and Dublin.
During the summer season, services by Ryanair to London, by Air Baltic to Vilnius and by  Scandinavian Airlines 
(SAS) to Copenhagen will be added.
In addition to the new flights to be added, it will continue to be possible to fly from Tallinn to  Amsterdam, Helsinki, 
Warsaw, Frankfurt, Riga, Copenhagen, Oslo, Minsk, Stockholm, London Gatwick and the Estonian island capitals 
Kuressaare and Kardla using services available round the year.

VILNIUS, Feb 17, BNS – Ireland's aircraft painting and exterior coatings company MAAS Aviation has opened a 
new paint shop at Kaunas Airport.

VILNIUS, Jan 18, BNS – Ireland's budget carrier is temporarily suspending all flights to and from Vilnius and 
Palanga due to the pandemic and travel restrictions, leaving Kaunas-Dublin as the only route it will operate to and 
from Lithuania in the next few months.
Tadas Vasiliauskas, spokesman for Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Lithuania's three 
international airports, said Ryanair was cutting its flight schedule in all European countries.
"It's currently known that the airline will simply not operate any flights from Vilnius Airport until the end of March due 
to the challenges caused by the pandemic and the existing travel restrictions, but this doesn't mean the closure of 
the base," he told BNS.
The spokesman said he had no confirmed information indicating that the company was planning to close its base at 
Vilnius Airport.
The Dublin-based carrier announced on January 7 that it was making big cuts to its flight schedule in response to 
COVID-19 restrictions.
"Ryanair will significantly cut its flight schedules from Thursday, 21 January, which will result in few, if any, flights 
being operated to/from Ireland or the UK from the end of Jan until such time as these draconian travel restrictions 
are removed:" it said in a statement.

Riga Airport plans to raise passenger numbers to 2.8 million this year
RIGA, Jan 12, BNS - Riga International Airport handled 2.01 air passengers last year, which is a 74 percent slump 
from a year before, but this year the airport plans to received 2.8 passengers, the airport's CEO Laila Odina said on 
Latvian Radio on Tuesday.
"The result achieved before the Covid-19 crisis significantly improved the official statistics for 2020, as Riga Airport 
had served 1.3 million passengers by mid-March, which means that in the remaining months of the year it only 
received 710,000 passengers," Odina said.
She added that in November and December, for instance, the airport handled slightly more than 50,000 passengers 
per month and the same trend continued also in January 2021.
The head of the airport also indicated that Latvia's airBaltic national airline remained the leading carrier at Riga 
Airport last year, followed by two low-costs carriers - Ireland's Ryanair and Hungary's Wizz Air.
Odina admitted that making forecasts for the next couple of years is difficult but said that, based on current 
forecasts, the airport might receive 2.8 million passengers in 2021. "This figure may seen quite unrealistic, 
considering that currently we are handling 50,000 passengers per month, but we hope very much that the changed 
flying rules, effective as of January 15, will stabilize the situation in the following months and that starting in May 
and June, passenger numbers would gradually increase to at least 30-40 percent of the number achieved in 2019," 
Odina said.
She also emphasized that Riga Airport is determined to maintain its status as the largest aviation hub in the Baltics. 
"We believe that we will manage to retain our position in the Baltics also in the future," she said.
As reported, starting January 15, people arriving in Latvia will have to present a negative Covid-19 test, taken in the 
past 72 hours.
Riga Airport plans to raise passenger numbers to 2.8 million this year
According to the Transport Ministry, the regulations will come into force along with similar regulations in Lithuania 
and Estonia.
In 2019, Riga Airport served 7.798 million passengers, which is an increase of 10.5 percent against 2018. Riga

Foreign Ministry not planning repatriation flights from UK as yet
RIGA, Dec 21, BNS - Although passenger transportation between Latvia and the United Kingdom has been 
temporarily suspended over a new Covid-19 variant currently spreading in the UK, people are still allowed to travel 
by other means, which is why repatriation flights from the UK are not being planned at the moment, Foreign Ministry 
press secretary Janis Bekeris told BNS.
He said that the ministry is getting phone calls from stranded Latvian citizens to its round-the-clock helpline and the 
embassy in London but that an instant solution cannot be provided for now. Bekeris said that Latvia is not the only 
country that has banned flights to the UK and that the list of countries halting traffic in one or both directions in 
growing.
"If a person cannot postpone the trip and has assessed all risks, there is the option to contact their carrier and 
inquire about flights to alternative destinations, but we cannot be sure that the situation will not change on other 
routes as well," said Bekeris, adding that fast decisions about the situation with the new Covid-19 strain are being 
taken not only in Latvia but also in other European Union member states.
The ministry's representative underlined that upon arriving in Latvia, all travelers are required to self-isolate for ten 
days, unless they arrive from Iceland or the Vatican.
Bekeris said that the decision to ban passenger traffic with the UK has been taken, considering public health 
interests and specialists' recommendations - if restricting traffic with a country can help protect society from the risk 
of infection, the measure has to be put in place. If the specialists indicate that the situation allows for lifting the ban, 
it will be lifted, Bekeris said.
As reported, taking into consideration reports of a new Covid-19 variant circulating in the United Kingdom, the 
Latvian government on Sunday banned passenger traffic with the UK from Monday, December 21, till January 1, 
State Chancellery spokeswoman Ilze Pavlova informed BNS.
Foreign Ministry not planning repatriation flights from UK as yet
Based on the Transport Ministry's proposal, the government on Sunday decided to temporarily halt international

in Latvia.
There are currently three carriers operating flights from Riga to the UK:  airBaltic, Ryanair and Wizzair. Latvia's 
airBaltic had planned 22 flights or 11 rotations to the UK before the end of this year. The airline had sold 1,004 
tickets to these flights, including about 40 percent to London-Riga flights and the rest to Riga-London flights.
The Transport Ministry indicated that Latvia's decision is similar to decisions taken by other European Union 
member states which have halted flights to and from the UK until the situation with the new virus strain is clarified. 
The other EU countries have already suspended flights to and from the UK or are planning to do so.
Transport Minister Talis Linkaits (New Conservative Party) said that today that fast and targeted action that is 
coordinated with other EU member states is essential to ensure public health interests.
As reported, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday that the government has imposed a strict 
Christmas lockdown in London and southeast England because a new strain of the coronavirus was "out of control".
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday that millions must cancel Christmas plans and stay 
home because the new strain was spreading far more quickly.
The World Health Organization has called on its members in Europe to strengthen measures against coronavirus 
due to the new variant circulating in the United Kingdom.

Irish low-costs carrier Ryanair wins EUR 1.6 million in legal dispute with Riga Airport
RIGA, Nov 27, BNS - Riga Regional Court has upheld a ruling of a first-instance court, which ordered Riga 
International Airport to pay EUR 1.6 million in damages and legal expenses to Irish low-costs carrier Ryanair, BNS 
was told at the court.
The appeals court ruled that the verdict delivered by an international court of arbitration on March 24, 2014 in the 
Irish airline's dispute with Riga Airport has to be upheld and enforced in Latvia.
The ruling of the appeals court cannot be further appealed and has taken effect.
That means that Riga Airport now has to pay Ryanai EUR 802,000 in damages plus legal expenses.
In its ruling, Riga Regional Court said that the verdict of the international court of arbitration did not affect the rights 
of the plaintiff's passengers as they were not parties of the agreement with the court of arbitration.
Under Ryanair's exclusive agreement with the Riga Airport, for a period of ten years the airline was offered more 
favorable conditions than other airlines operating flights to the Riga Airport. The compensation payment has been 
put on hold at the moment as the European Commission is looking into the matter to determine whether the 
advantages offered to Ryanair could be interpreted as unlawful state aid.
The agreement, signed in July 23, 2014, guaranteed special conditions for Ryanair – the airline had to pay the 
airport EUR 4.5 fee per passenger, and aircraft maintenance cost for the airline was reduced from EUR 500 to EUR 
1. The exclusive agreement was in force also in 2012, when the airport introduced a special security fee for 
passengers, which Ryanair refused to pay saying that the new fee violated the airport's agreement with the airline. 
Ryanair turned to the London Court of International Arbitration, which ruled in the airline's favor.
Irish low-costs carrier Ryanair wins EUR 1.6 million in legal dispute with Riga Airport
The airport failed to convince the court that inclusion of the exclusive provisions in the agreement with Ryanair was 
ordered by then Transport Minister Ainars Slesers. It was Slesers who, on behalf of the airport, offered Ryanair the 
exclusive conditions later included in the agreement, as proved by electronic communication between Slesers and 
Ryanair management one year before the signing of the agreement. These e-mails indicate that the airline's 
management was against offering such exclusive conditions to Ryanair, but Slesers intervened, promising Ryanair 
that the state would cover large part of the airport's costs for the airline if the airport's passenger turnover increased 
substantially.
The London court ordered Riga Airport to pay Ryanair EUR 802,000 plus litigation costs, therefore the airport is to 
pay Ryanair more than EUR 1.5 million in total.
The airport eventually decided to turn to the European Commission, asking the Commission's opinion whether 
unlawful state aid was provided to Ryanair from 2004 to 2014. The airport is calculating losses that the state has 
suffered due to the exclusive agreement between Slesers and Ryanair. This is not the first such case investigated 
by the Commission, however. It has looked into 21 similar cases to date, in six of which Ryanair was ordered to pay 
compensation – more than EUR 10 million in total.

Ireland's MAAS Aviation about to open hangar at Kaunas airport, eyes expansion
VILNIUS, Nov 12, BNS – Ireland's MAAS Aviation is set to open its new aircraft painting hangar at Kaunas Airport 
shortly, with plans to expand it in the future.
"The coronavirus pandemic has reduced the number of flights, but we feel strong and want to further strengthen our 
market position," MAAS Aviation CEO Tim Macdougald said in a press release on Thursday.
"We already have 85 percent of orders for next year," he added.
The airport's good geographical location and the hangar's proximity to aircraft service companies – Ryanair, FL 
Technics, DOT, AviaBaltika and OS Technics – have a positive impact on the company's development plans, 
McDougald said.
When completed, the 7,000-square-meter hangar will  be able to accommodate two aircraft simultaneously and will 
create 50-80 jobs. The company is planning to expand it in the future to accommodate more aircraft.
MAAS Aviation has been operating for 37 years. The company's bases in Europe and the United States repaint 300 
aircraft per year on average.

spokeswoman Laura Kulakova told BNS.
In October, the airport served 90,500 passengers, which is by 600,000 passengers or 87.2 percent less from the 
respective period last year.
Most of the passengers or 60.1 percent were carried by Latvian national airline airBaltic, 19.9 percent were carried

Riga Airport sees 69.6% drop in passenger volumes in first nine months
RIGA, Oct 15, BNS - 1.8 million passengers were served at Riga International Airport in the first nine months of this 
year, which is 69.6 percent less than in the corresponding period last year, Laura Kulakova, a representative of 
state-owned joint-stock company Riga International Airport, informed BNS.
In September, 113,600 passengers were served at Riga Airport, which is 77,000 less than in August. Compared to 
September 2019, the number of passengers served has decreased by 85 percent.
Laila Odina, the Chairman of the Board of Riga Airport, pointed out that in September it was possible to go to 51 
destinations from Riga Airport, which is two destinations more than in August, however, most destinations were 
located in a high-risk area, from which passengers have to self-quarantine on arrival, significantly reducing flight 
occupancy.
The average aircraft load factor in September was 31 percent, which is significantly less than in August, when the 
load factor was 57 percent.
The most popular destinations from Riga Airport in September were London, Oslo, Tallinn, Helsinki and Frankfurt, 
but the busiest planes went to Tbilisi, Cyprus and Manchester.
However, even in these difficult conditions, the share of transit passengers at Riga Airport remained high - travelers 
who used Riga Airport as a connecting point to further destinations accounted for 27 percent of the total number of 
passengers.
The majority or 60 percent of passengers served in September were carried by the national airline airBaltic, 18 
percent by the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair and 9 percent by the Hungarian low-cost carrier WizzAir.
Riga Airport sees 69.6% drop in passenger volumes in first nine months
In September, the airport served 3,332 flights, which is almost 60 percent less than in September 2019. During the 
year, the number of flights decreased by 56.3 percent to 28,945 flights. The largest number - 2,368 flights - was 
performed at the airport by regular passenger carriers, 437 were business aviation flights, but 240 flights were 
performed by cargo carriers.
In September, 2,148 tons of cargo were handled at Riga Airport, which is 6 percent more than in September 2019. 
In total, in the first nine months of 2020, more than 16,000 tons of cargo were handled at Riga Airport.
In 2019, Riga Airport served 7.798 million passengers, up 10.5 percent against 2018. In the first half of 2020, the 
airport handled 1.32 million passengers, down 62.9 percent from the respective period in 2019.

Estonian econmin: Flight restrictions may not end yet
TALLINN, Aug 17, BNS - Estonian Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure Taavi Aas said that flight 
restrictions can put passengers and airlines in a difficult position, but with current knowledge, one can be rather 
satisfied that there was enough daring to be the first in Europe to introduce such a restriction, the daily Postimees 
writes.
"The epidemiological situation, which has deteriorated in recent weeks in several countries, needs to be closely 
monitored when opening new connections and the cost-effectiveness of routes needs to be analyzed when opening 
new ones," the minister said, but did not specify when and where direct routes could be opened.
In spring, Aas signed an order according to which airlines may not open routes to countries with a high risk of 
coronavirus from Estonia from May 18. The restriction is valid at least until August 31, before which the government 
will assess the further necessity of the restriction. "Looking at the increasing number of new virus cases abroad in 
recent weeks, I am not too optimistic that we can end the restriction this month," the minister said.
The ministry bases the process of allowing and prohibiting destination countries on the morbidity rate of the other 
countries, which must be 25 or less people per 100,000 inhabitants in the last 14 days in order to open the route. As 
the infection rate rose to over 25 in Denmark, France and Cyprus, Air Baltic flights between Tallinn and 
Copenhagen and Paris will be canceled until Friday and Ryanair's flight to the Cypriot resort town of Paphos was 
canceled on Sunday.
Critical of the flight restrictions is Reform Party MEP Urmas Paet, according to whom banning flights is a pointless 
and harmful activity for Estonia that causes real harm to Estonian people returning home as well as to airlines, 
which are already in a difficult situation. "The fact that the existence of an air connection does not exclude or 
facilitate the spread of the virus makes it especially silly. There are layover opportunities, because such a madness 
of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications to close air connections is not practiced in Finland, 
Germany or almost anywhere else," Paet said. "This means that transfers to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Paris and 
Estonian econmin: Flight restrictions may not end yet
elsewhere are available at other airports. But this is more complicated and expensive for people and also increases 
the number of contacts during the trip," he added.
Aas admitted that a difficult situation has arisen for people and airlines -- it is not possible to plan their activities with 
full confidence for more than a week. At the same time, he added that this year is different due to the pandemic and 
the bigger goal is to protect public health.
"As we have seen, the wider spread of the virus in July was largely due to people traveling abroad. In the light of 
this, I can safely say that, although the restriction may seem inconvenient at times, we do not know what the 
situation would be without the restriction on opening routes. At the same time, no restriction is a magic wand, but 
interacts with other restrictions and responsible behavior by people," Aas said.
The current restriction was developed in cooperation with the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian health authorities, 
and according to the minister, one can be rather satisfied that there was enough daring to be the first in Europe to 
introduce such a restriction. "As can be seen, the United Kingdom caused panic among its citizens by imposing a 
travel restriction only now," Aas said.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's July passenger numbers grow over 3-fold m-o-m
TALLINN, Aug 05, BNS – In July, 75,682 passengers passed through Tallinn Airport, which is approximately 24 
percent of the volume of passengers in July last year; however, the number of passengers more than tripled 
compared to June 2020.
"In the last two months, the number of destinations has increased significantly, offering people the opportunity to fly 
for both holidays and business trips. In July, flights to Warsaw, Milan, Dusseldorf, Edinburgh and Dublin were 
resumed," Riivo Tuvike, CEO of Tallinn Airport, said in a press release.
There were also a few single flights to Malaga and Girona in Spain, as well as to Ukrainian destinations such as 
Kyiv, Kharkiv and Lviv, which are currently suspended again. It was possible to fly to Greece by charter flights.
"Unfortunately, the situation is constantly changing and, depending on the number of infections in the countries of 
destination, the flight plan can change very quickly. That is why we urge passengers to follow the flight schedule in 
real time and contact their airline if necessary," Tuvike said.
The average load factor of flights also improved in July, reaching 53 percent. "The highest passenger volumes and 
higher load factors were mainly on flights to countries with low infection rates. Thus, in July, Vienna became one of 
the most popular destinations, with Air Baltic, Ryanair and Wizzair flying there," Tuvike added.
A total of 2,140 flights took place in July, an average of 69 landings and take-offs a day.
As of the beginning of August, there are regular flights on a total of 20 direct routes. Tallinn Airport urges all 
passengers to familiarize themselves with the restrictions and requirements of the destination country before going 
on a trip. Information can be found on both the Reisi Targalt (Travel Smart) and Re-open EU websites.

the Irish low-cost airline Ryanair and 11 percent by the Hungarian low-cost carrier WizzAir.
The number of passengers who use Riga Airport as a convenient transfer point for further travel is gradually 
increasing - the number of transit and transfer passengers in July accounted for 24 percent of the total number of 
passengers. The most popular destinations from Riga in July were Oslo, London, Helsinki, Frankfurt and Tallinn, 
but the fullest flights were on holiday routes to Greece, Cyprus and the south of France.
In July, 3,278 flights were served at Riga Airport, but in the first seven months of this year, more than 22,000 flights 
were operated to and from the airport - which is by 55.8 percent less than in the corresponding period of the 
previous year.
The airport reminds that international passenger flights to Latvia are allowed from countries where the cumulative 
Covid-19 14-day incidence rate per 100,000 inhabitants is lower than 25, as well as from countries included in the 
European Commission's list of safe countries.
In July, the Polish airline LOT Polish and the Norwegian low-cost airline Norwegian resumed operations at Riga 
Airport, so currently a total of seven airlines operate flights to and from Riga to 49 destinations.

Lithuania's Oro Navigacija sees revenue drop 51 pct, incurs loss of EUR 4.9 mln
VILNIUS, Aug 03, BNS – Lithuania's state-owned flight management company Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation) saw 
its revenue from main activity drop 51 percent to 6.67 million euros in the first half of this year and suffered a loss of 
4.9 million euros after posted a net profit of 1.8 million euros a year ago.
The company says its results were affected by a decrease in flight numbers due to flying restrictions all over the 
world. Lower services rates also had negative impact.
"The border restrictions introduced in March led to a drastic drop in flight numbers," the company's acting CEO 
Marius Beliunas said.
Flight numbers have recently started recovering, he noted, but the situation is not stable yet as a risk remains that 
the virus outbreak will return and any restrictions will have direct impact on airlines.
The number of flights that were provided air navigation services drooped 48.5 percent to 65,000 in tge first half of 
this year. 49,000 planes (74.9 percent of the total number of flights) flew via Lithuania in transit, down 48.7 percent 
from the same period last year, and the number of flights serviced in Lithuania went down by 47.6 percent.
Oro Navigacija's key customers last year included Russia’s Aeroflot, Ireland’s Ryanair and Latvia’s airBaltic.

Lithuania to introduce mandatory isolation for arrivals from France as of Monday (expands)
VILNIUS, Jul 31, BNS – People arriving to Lithuania from France will have to self-isolate for two weeks as of 
Monday, Lithuania's top epidemiologist Loreta Asokliene said on Friday.
A total of 12 countries will be on Lithuania's "blacklist" as of Monday. Only Lithuanians will be able to come from ten 
of those countries, and foreigners will be also allowed to come from two of them, including France and Austria.
Regular flights from Lithuania to France are not carried out by airBaltic, Wizz Air and Ryanair, according to 
Lithuania's airport operator, Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports).
airBaltic flights to Paris and back take place on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Wizz Air flieswto Nice on 
Wednesdays and Sundays, and Ryanair's flights to Paris take place on Tuesdays and Sundays, according to 
information on their official websites.
Foreigners will not be allowed to come from Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Portugal, Romania, the Czech Republic, 
Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Croatia and Malta. The decision on the latter might change as the impact on sick rescued 
migrants on the country's rates is being analyzed, Asokliene said.
Countries are put on Lithuania's "blacklist" if they record 16 coronavirus cases per population of 100,000 over the 
past two weeks.
The rate now stands at 15.7 cases per population of 100,000 in Poland, therefore, this country is likely to be put on 
the list next Friday.

"We hear they are registering a growing number of cases, and we need to monitor the situation but the rate is very 
close to the limit," Asokliene said, adding that Poland could be put on the list earlier, if the number of cases goes up 
fast.
"If something changes significantly, it might be considered," Asokliene said.
In her words, the morbidity rates in Latvia and Estonia are similar and stand at 2.6 cases per population of 100,000. 
It stands at 5.7 cases per population 100,000 in Lithuania.

Number of flights in Lithuanian airspace halves in H1 2020 y/y
VILNIUS, Jul 15, BNS - The total number of flights handled in Lithuanian airspace plunged to 65,000 in the first half 
of 2020, down 48.5 percent from 126,300 in the same period last year, Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation) said on 
Wednesday.
The year got off to a promising start for the aviation sector, but flights were soon grounded by the novel coronavirus 
pandemic, the state-owned air navigation service provider said in a press release.
Commenting on air traffic recovery trends, Oro Navigacija's acting CEO Marius Beliunas said that the situation 
remained quite positive.
Oro Navigacija forecasts that the rate of decline in flight numbers will decelerate to 20-30 percent by the end of the 
year, provided that a second wave of the pandemic does not occur, he said.
Of all flights that took off or landed at Lithuanian airports in the first half, 2,600 were operated by Ireland's Ryanair, 
1,600 by Latvia's Airbaltic, 1,300 by Hungary's Wizzair, 1,100 by Poland's LOT, and 856 by Sweden's SAS.
The most popular destinations were from Vilnius to Riga (1,057 flights served), to Warsaw (747 flights) and to Minsk 
(504 flights).
Air traffic controllers handled 11,000 flights at Vilnius Airport during the first half (down 51.7 percent year-on-year), 
3,000 at Kaunas Airport, just over 1,000 at Palanga Airport and 1,300 at Siauliai Airport.
The total number of transit flights over Lithuania slumped down by 49 percent in the first half from a year ago to

In July, flights can be taken from Tallinn Airport to 26 destinations
TALLINN, Jul 13, BNS – In July, routes will be opened from Tallinn Airport to 12 destinations, including London, 
Milan, Edinburgh, Malaga, Girona, Dusseldorf, Dublin, Oslo and Warsaw, as travel restrictions applied due to the 
coronavirus crisis are being gradually lifted and connections with major European destinations are being restored.
Eero Pargmae, chief commercial officer of Tallinn Airport, described June as a month when many things became 
clearer, as developments in air traffic occurred within days and even hours.
Pargmae said the desire and need of people to travel has not disappeared and airlines have waited for long to 
reopen the routes.
"The good news is that flying is again possible to major hubs as well as the beloved holiday destinations," he said.
First, airlines have reopened routes to business and holiday destinations that are important for Estonians, such as 
Berlin, Warsaw, Paris and Copenhagen, but also to major connecting airports, such as Frankfurt, Helsinki and Riga. 
Routes to Brussels, Istanbul and Moscow are expected to open in August
At the beginning of July, tour operator Novatours started selling charter flights to Greece.
"We believe that holiday flights will be offered in August also to other destinations that are popular among 
Estonians. People are really waiting for charter flights to Turkey, Bulgaria and Spain. However, we can start talking 
about reopening these destinations only if they are safe for passengers," the CCO added.
According to Pargmae, Tallinn Airport hopes to see 30 destinations opened by the end of August, which would be 
quite near the pre-crisis level, when passengers were able to fly with 15 airlines to 36 destinations, 28 of which 
were open round the year.
In July, flights can be taken from Tallinn Airport to 26 destinations
Currently, seven airlines -- Air Baltic, Finnair, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Norwegian, Transaviabaltika and Wizzair -- have 
opened regular routes to Tallinn. In July, most likely also Belavia, LOT, easyJet will do the same, while Turkish 
Airlines, Aeroflot and SAS are expected to resume operation to Tallinn in August.
Pargmae said that airports and airlines have worked hard to ensure that travelling is safe for people.
"For the time being, wearing a mask onboard a plane is obligatory, while wearing a mask at the airport is to a large 
extent voluntary," Pargmae noted. He recommended that passengers get acquainted with safety regulations and 
possible restrictions at the destination, airports and airlines before each flight.
The Estonian Foreign Ministry has recommended to refrain from international travel, except for to countries of 
Europe where the coronavirus infection rate is 16 or fewer cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days and 
upon return from where no self-isolation is required.

Riga Airport sees passenger numbers surge 400% month-on-month
RIGA, Jul 3, BNS - With airlines increasing the number of flights and reopening more and more routes, Riga 
International Airport has seen passenger numbers surge by more than 400 percent over the past month, the 
airport's representative Laura Kulakova informed BNS.
In June 2020, Riga Airport served 55,445 passengers, an increase of 437 percent against May. However, 
compared to June 2019, the number of passengers at the airport was still 92.7 percent lower in June this year.
In the first half of 2020, the number of passengers at the airport fell 62.9 from the same period a year ago to 1.3 
million.
Kulakova said that low-costs carrier Norwegian is restarting regular operations from Riga as of this Friday. The first 
Norwegian flight from Riga is scheduled to the Norway's capital city Oslo. The carrier plans to operate two flights a 
week on the Rig-Oslo route - on Mondays and Fridays.
Starting next week, passengers will be able to fly to more than 40 destinations from Riga as six carriers are 
restarting passenger service from Riga: Latvia's airBaltic national carrier, Germany's Lufthansa, Finland's Finnair, 
Irish low-costs airline Ryanair, Hungarian no-frills carrier Wizz Air and Norwegian.
International passenger flights to Latvia are allowed from countries where the 14-day cumulative number of Covid-
19 cases does not exceed 25 per 100,000 population, as well as countries included in the European Commission's 
list of safe countries.
Before arriving at Riga Airport, passengers are encouraged to get acquainted with the safety measures on the 
airport’s website and carefully read the safety requirements of their chosen airline. For example, the national airline 
airBaltic does not let passengers with a body temperature of over 37.8°C to board their aircraft. The temperature is 
taken before security checks.

The airport also encourages potential travelers to find out in advance of their trip what entry requirements and 
restrictions the destination country has in place.

Lithuania reopens air travel to and from another six countries
VILNIUS, Jun 10, BNS - The Lithuanian government on Wednesday gave the green light for resuming regular 
flights to and from another six countries –  Cyprus, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Spain and Ireland.
The Foreign Minister says Wizz Air, Ryanair and Air Baltic have asked for permission to relaunch certain flights to 
and from Lithuania.
"Cyprus will reopen to unrestricted travel by Lithuanian citizens from June 20.  Wizz Air would fly to Larnaca from 
Vilnius and Ryanair would fly to Paphos from Kaunas," Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius told the Cabinet.
"Greece is also reopening flights to Athens from June 15, and Lithuanian citizens will be able to travel to the islands 
without restrictions from July 1," he said.
The Cabinet also gave the green light for resuming regular flights from European Economic Area countries, 
Switzerland and the United Kingdom, provided that the incidence of COVID-19 in a specific country has not 
exceeded 25 cases per 100,000 people over the last 14 days.
The "safe list" of countries is updated every Monday.
Last week, the government allowed relaunching regular flights from Lithuania to France, Denmark and Finland. That 
followed the reopening of regular air travel to and from Germany, the Netherlands and Norway.

Lithuanian court lifts freeze on EUR 58 million assets of airBaltic, Riga Airport
VILNIUS, May 13, BNS - A Lithuanian court has recently lifted a sequestration order placed more than 11 years ago 
on almost 58 million euros' worth of assets of airBaltic and Riga Airport.
Vilnius Regional Court on May 5 granted the Latvian companies' request to lift the interim measure, Lina 
Nemeikaite, the court's spokeswoman, told BNS.
The Lithuanian Court of Appeal on March 31, 2020 dismissed a lawsuit filed by the bankrupt FlyLAL-Lithuanian 
Airlines against airBaltic.
The sequestration of 57.875 million euros' worth of assets was removed after the appeal court's judgement took 
effect.
The Lithuanian Court of Appeal ordered the assets to be sequestrated back in late 2008.The judgement was 
recognized by Latvian courts, and the EU Court of Justice in 2014 also allowed sequestrating the Latvian 
companies' assets.
In 2015, the Lithuanian Court of Appeal dismissed the Latvian companies' request to lift the sequestration order on 
the grounds that it did not impede their operations and did not violate the principle of proportionality.
The Lithuanian Court of Appeal ruled in late March that FlyLAL would not recover more than 16 million euros in 
damages from airBaltic. FlyLAL accused the Latvian airline and Riga Airport of distorting competition and forcing it 
out of the market.
FlyLAL bankruptcy administrator Aurimas Valaitis told BNS that they would appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court 
of Lithuania, but did not plan to contest the Vilnius Regional Court's judgment of May 5.

More than a decade ago, FlyLAL sued airBaltic and Riga Airport for their alleged agreement on lower prices at the 
Latvian airport. FlyLAL claimed that Air Baltic's "predatory" pricing in Vilnius Airport had ousted it from the flight 
market.
Experts put the damages sustained by FlyLAL due to discrimination at 43.4 million euros, but the Lithuanian 
company insisted on its 57.87-million-euro claim.
Latvia's competition authority ruled back in 2006 that discounts offered by Riga Airport distorted the market and 
favored two companies – airBaltic and Ireland's Ryanair.

New aircraft painting hangar at Kaunas airport to create 400 jobs
VILNIUS, May 05, BNS – MAAS Aviation, a company providing aircraft painting services, has started building a new 
aircraft painting hangar in the territory of Kaunas Airport and will create more than 400 skilled jobs, Karolis 
Matulaitis, the airport’s CEO, has said.
“Basically, the airport has to stand on two legs, one of which is the transportation of passengers and the other – the 
carriage of cargo or technical maintenance operations,” a press release from Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian 
Airports, or LOU), the operator of Lithuania's three international airports, quoted Matulaitis as saying.
The two-part hangar, which should be completed by the end of this year, will be located in the northern part of the 
airport’s territory.
With the construction of the hangar finalized, the MRO capacity at the airport will increase to 11 commercial aircraft 
simultaneously, which are likely to include Airbus A320s and Boeing B737s – the two aircraft models that are used 
for flights to Lithuania the most frequently.
The Kaunas Airport currently serves as a base for Ireland’s no-frill carrier Ryanair as well as MRO providers FL 
Technics, DOT, Aviabaltika and OS Technics.

PM: Lithuania may resume first passenger flights on May 10-15 (expands)
VILNIUS, Apr 28, BNS - The first passenger flights from Lithuania to foreign countries may be resumed on May 10-
15, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said on Tuesday.
Skvernelis did not say which routes might be reopened initially, but noted that air travel to countries that do not 
apply quarantine restrictions or are coronavirus hotspots will not be resumed.
"The government will consider how to renew flights at Vilnius Airport, but certainly not today," the prime minister 
said, adding that "some first steps" toward resuming air travel could be made "around May 10-15".
"Of course, there won't be many routes and there won't be routes from those countries that do not have a 
quarantine regime or have massive outbreaks," he said.
Transport Minister Jaroslav Narkevic named Latvia, Germany and Poland among the first possible destinations.
"The first flights could be to Latvia, Germany, Poland if those countries reopen to (Lithuanian) citizens," he told 
reporters, adding that these countries require arrivals to go into quarantine for two weeks.
According to the minister, the German airline Lufthansa has "semi-officially" informed Lithuania that it is ready to 
resume flights to the country.
"But I know that other companies are selling tickets, too," he said. " Ryanair and Wizzair accept bookings in other 
countries, too, for flights to Lithuania, and when this period occurs will depend on the COVID-19 commission's 
decision".
In an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Lithuania closed its airspace to passenger flights in early April.

Hungary's low-cost airline Wizz Air is also selling tickets for flights from Vilnius to London starting from May 13, and 
for flights to Milan, Oslo, Paris and other destinations from May 17.
Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has told the Financial Times recently that the Irish budget carrier expects to run 
about 40 percent of its flights if air travel is resumed in Europe in July. It plans to increase capacity to 60 percent in 
August and up to 80 percent in September.
He said, however, that the airline would not resume flights if there were some social distancing measures, such as 
having middle seats empty.
BPC Travel has announced that a flight from Vilnius to London is planned for May 2, but passengers must prove 
they have a place of residence or a contract to work in England.

airBaltic doesn't need to pay flyLAL EUR 16 million - Lithuanian court
VILNIUS, Apr 2, BNS - Bankrupt airline flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines will not recover over EUR 16 million in damages 
from Latvian air carrier airBaltic. The Lithuanian company accused airBaltic and Riga Airport of breaching 
competition and forcing it out of the market.
On March 31, the Court of Appeal of Lithuania annulled Vilnius Regional Court's ruling issued in January, 2016, 
which awarded FlyLAL EUR 16.121 million in damages from airBaltic, FlyLAL's bankruptcy administrator Aurimas 
Valaitis told BNS.
"Having heard the appeals from both sides, the appeal institution annulled the ruling of the court of first instance 
and issued a new ruling rejecting FlyLAL's lawsuit. (…) The court concluded there was no damage and it did not 
take experts' conclusions into consideration," Valaitis said.
The appeal court heard the case behind closed doors and the ruling was non-public.
Vilma Budeniene, spokeswoman for the Lithuanian court, told BNS the court satisfied the Latvian companies' 
complaints and rejected FlyLAL's demands.
Valaitis says their side are now considering turning to the Supreme Court of Lithuania. "I think we will definitely do 
that and we will see when we will lodge the appeal and whether the Supreme Court will accept it no later than over 
the three months since the day of the adoption of the Court of Appeal's ruling," Valaitis said.
The dispute between flyLAL and Air Baltic Corporation and Riga Airport was sparked more than a decade ago by 
an alleged violation of the competition law and damage. flyLAL is asking for the compensation of damage caused 
by airBaltic and Riga Airport's alleged illicit discount agreement at Riga Airport. flyLAL claims it was pushed out of 
the flight market due to airBaltic's predatory pricing at Vilnius Airport.

60 non-flying planes find refuge at Lithuanian airports
VILNIUS, Apr 01, BNS – As many countries across the world have closed their borders and suspended flights, air 
companies have started looking for places to leave their planes safely. There are now 60 such planes at Lithuanian 
airports, mainly in Vilnius.
Also, some airlines have chosen Siauliai Airport, northern Lithuania, where passenger planes usually don’t land and 
where there's a military airport nearby.
There are 47 planes belonging to Ryanair, Wizzair, Eurowings, GetJet, Avion Express, Danish Air Transport and 
several other companies at Vilnius and Kaunas Airports, and 13 World Star Aviation and GetJet Airlines planes are 
stationed in Siauliai.
Vilnius Airport has 35 parking lots for various planes, and there 24 such lots in Kaunas and five in Palanga, and 
companies can leave their planes their during quarantine time.
"We are currently experiencing the need for parking spaces, therefore, 29 planes are being kept at the capital's

Not all airlines will resume work after travel restrictions lifted - Gauss
RIGA, Apr 1, BNS - Due to the travel restrictions introduced around the world to help battle the spread of Covid-19, 
there will be some airlines that will not resume their work when these restrictions are lifted, the CEO of Latvian 
airline airBaltic Martin Gauss told BNS.
"I think that airlines which have the state behind them will resume work. Of course, big and profitable companies 
like Ryanair and Wizzair will also continue to fly because they have enough money to survive the crisis," Gauss 
said.
He recalled that 40 years ago in Europe, almost all airlines were state owned and then began to be privatized one 
by one. Now, most likely, countries will re-engage with airlines in various ways and then sell the shares again.
"I think this will significantly change the landscape in the transportation market. At the same time, big players like 
Lufthansa could become much smaller because there will simply be no demand," said the airBaltic chief executive.
He said the president of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently predicted that the total impact of 
the Covid-19 crisis on the airline industry would be EUR 250 billion. In addition, this figure is likely to increase as the 
crisis is now beginning to develop rapidly in the US.
"We look at what other airlines in Europe are doing and what support they are getting. We see that Lufthansa, SAS, 
Finnair, AirFrance, British Airways will get some form of government support. Here at airBaltic we are capable of 
dealing with the crisis ourselves, but as the crisis continues, we will look at what support may become available. It 
may also be support from the European Union. It has not yet been decided. Both the Latvian state and our private 
shareholder have said they want us as to continue to operate as an airline," Gauss stressed.
Not all airlines will resume work after travel restrictions lifted - Gauss
As reported, in an effort to prevent Covid-19 from spreading further in Latvia, a state of emergency came into force 
on March 13, setting a number of tough restrictions. The state of emergency is in force until April 14. The 
emergency measures include a ban on all international passenger transportation by air, sea, roads and railway.
Latvian national airline airBaltic last year posted EUR 508.955 million in turnover, up 23 percent, while the 
company's loss reached EUR 7.7 million.
The airline's primary shareholder is the Latvian state, which holds 80.05 percent of the stock, while Danish 
businessman Lars Thuesen holds around 20 percent through his fully-owned Aircraft Leasing 1.

Ryanair will conduct additional repatriation flights from London and Berlin to Vilnius
RIGA, Mar 24, BNS - Ryanair will conduct repatriation flights from London and Berlin to Vilnius, which will also be 
made available to Latvian nationals, Foreign Ministry press secretary Janis Bekeris posted on Twitter.
He said that these repatriation flights will be conducted today. Once arriving in Vilnius, passengers travelling to 
Latvia will them have to ride in an organized transit convoy to the Latvian border.
As reported, Lithuania's government has decided to allow foreigners to cross the country in transit until Thursday.
"People returning to their country of residence are allowed to cross the Lithuanian territory in transit until 00 hours 
on March 26 without necessary stops in groups of people or vehicles by ensuring mandatory escort of these groups 
from the arrival in Lithuania to their departure via international border crossing points," Interior Minister Rita 
Tamasuniene said.
Lithuania closed its borders to foreigners after the country was placed under quarantine last Monday to slow the 
spread of the new coronavirus. But the country gave foreigners time to return to their countries via Lithuania.
The deadline was in place for three days and was extended to the end of last week, but has now been extended 
until March 26.

ForMin lists options for returning to Estonia
TALLINN, Mar 19, BNS – The Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that several passenger carriage companies 
have reduced the number of trips or cancelled trips altogether and the ministry has thus compiled a list of options 
for returning to Estonia from abroad.
It is worth bearing in mind that measures taken by different countries may become increasingly strict and be 
extended at short notice, with fewer opportunities for mobility, spokespeople for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
According to information currently available to the ministry, options for returning to Estonia are on a special flight of 
Nordica from Malaga, Spain, from Berlin and Edinburgh with Ryanair, from Frankfurt with Lufthansa until March 31, 
from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines from March 19 to 26 as flights will be suspended from March 27 to April 17, from 
Copenhagen with SAS as Estonians can use Copenhagen as a transit city, from London with Ryanair and Easyjet, 
from Malta with Ryanair's regular flights until March 21, according to current information, from Minsk with Belavia on 
the next flights scheduled for March 19, 26 and 28, from Moscow with Aeroflot until March 19 inclusive of said date, 
while the Moscow-Tallinn train will stop running on March 20, from Paphos with Ryanair, from Stockholm with SAS 
and from Weeze with Ryanair.
Passenger ferries are still operating between Helsinki and Tallinn. Tallink Grupp is currently continuing ferry traffic 
between Estonia and Finland on the basis of an altered timetable but is asking that passengers check whether they 
have the right to enter the country when purchasing tickets. Additional information can be found on the websites of 
Tallink, Eckero Line or Viking Line.
Tallink has announced that its vessel will depart from Sassnitz, Germany for Paldiski every other day at 7 p.m. local 
time, the first trip from Germany will take place on Friday, March 20. The journey time between Paldiski and 
Sassnitz is approximately 20 hours. The vessel’s cargo capacity is 100 lorries and 10 passenger vehicles. The ship 
can transport up to 330 passengers per trip. Passengers with vehicles will be allowed to travel on Star, providing 
they have the right to enter the country at the destination port and there is capacity for passengers. Passengers 
ForMin lists options for returning to Estonia
without vehicles will not be allowed on board. Food and medical supplies transport will be prioritized during the 
booking process. Accommodation for everyone travelling with Star will be provided in cabins. Bookings for Star's 
departures can be made via the Estonian call center at booking.cargo@tallink.ee or by phone call to +372 612 
8686.
Finnish airline Finnair will continue flying between Helsinki and Thailand until the end of March. Flights to and from 
Thailand have been cancelled from April 1 until June 30. Transit through Finland from international airports and 
ports is permitted. For example, people will be able to independently travel from Vantaa Airport or the port of Turku 
to Helsinki port in order to get on a ship to Tallinn. No additional documents, aside from having to present a ferry 
ticket, will be demanded.
Qatar, Emirates, Turkish and China Airlines are flying from Vietnam to Europe. Flight schedule information one day 
in advance can be found at http://noibaiairport.vn/HOME/Lichbay.aspx and the hotline of Noibai Airport is 1900 636 
535.
Flights from the United States to larger capitals in Europe include Delta flights from New York's John F. Kennedy 
Airport to London's Heathrow once a day starting from March 16, Delta flights from Detroit to Amsterdam once a 
day, United flights from New York's Newark Airport to Frankfurt, Munich and Brussels, currently taking place once a 
day until the end of March and United flights from Washington, D.C. to Frankfurt, currently once a day until the end 
of March.
In cooperation with Estonian company AlphaGIS, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also created a new map 
application indicating the transit options for returning to Estonia as at 9 a.m. local time on March 19, which can be 
viewed at https://bit.ly/3b0Sv4S
People returning from abroad must remain in isolation at home for a period of 14 days. The purpose of isolation is 
to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
The ministry stressed that all residents of Estonia avoid non-essential trips even if they are allowed. Each 
passenger must also monitor their own health.
When it comes to commuting between Estonia and Finland, it should be borne in mind that Finnish authorities 
specified on Wednesday that people crossing the border for work will not be subject to the 14-day quarantine 
requirement in Finland. A similar decision was also made by the Estonian government leader as the person in 
charge of the emergency situation in Estonia to enable commuting from Estonia if the commuter's place of 
residence, according to the population register, is Estonia but they work in Finland. The order also includes a 
restriction according to which it will be possible to travel between Estonia and Finland once per seven days without 
a quarantine requirement, meaning that returning to Estonia cannot take place more frequently than once a week.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport still connected to 8 European cities
TALLINN, Mar 19, BNS – The Estonian state-owned airport company Tallinn Airport said that six airlines are still 
flying from the Estonian capital to eight destinations in Europe.
The airport said that it is currently possible to fly with Ryanair to Berlin, Dusseldorf, Edinburgh and London, while 
the latter route is also serviced by Easyjet. Lufthansa is flying to Frankfurt and Belavia to Minsk.
Norwegian Airlines will be flying to Oslo until March 23 and Turkist Airlines announced that it will keep the Tallinn-
Istanbul route operational until March 28.
CEO of Tallinn Airport Riivo Tuvike said that these are currently destinations from which people can also fly back to 
Estonia. Airlines have reduced frequencies on these routes, but are still flying at present.
"At the same time, I want to stress to everyone that information changes in a matter of hours. I recommend 
following the flight plan on the airport's website and contacting your travel agent or airline. Most importantly, think 
about whether you need to travel at the moment," Tuvike said in a press release.
"We are currently talking about the temporary closure of routes, the temporary suspension of scheduled flights and 
the postponement of the launch of new routes," he said, adding that representatives of the airport are in contact 
with airlines on a daily basis and are prepared to resume service on the basis of the previous flight schedule at any 
moment.
"The airport will remain open for passengers and freight, medical and private flights. As an airport, we serve as one 
of the important gateways and it is important for us that Estonians can get home and people, who want to leave, to 
the rest of Europe," Tuvike added.
Estonia : Tallinn Airport still connected to 8 European cities
According to the airport, the number of passengers arriving to and departing from Tallinn Airport has declined by an 
average of 19 percent over the last two weeks. The number of passengers started falling already in the last few 
weeks of February. The final impact of the crisis on passenger numbers will be determined in the second half of 
summer, Tuvike added.
The airport has also introduced security measures. The terminal is being cleaned more frequently than before, and 
additional disinfectants have been made available to passengers and staff. Temporary safety glasses have been 
installed on the counters of check-in, lost & found as well information desks to protect passengers and staff.

(Updates paragraph 6)
RIGA, Mar 6, BNS - As of this Saturday, all travelers arriving in Latvia from Italy with symptoms of illness will be 
tested for the coronavirus disease Covid-19, Jurijs Perevoscikovs, director of the infectious diseases risk and 
analysis department at the Center for Disease Prevention and Control, told journalists today.
Until now, special coronavirus prevention measures were only applied to those travelers who returned from Italy's 
northern regions - Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont. From now on, the measures will be applied 
to everyone arriving from any region of Italy.
Likewise, the measures are applied to travelers arriving from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Iran.
The decision to expand the preventive measures to all travelers arriving from Italy has been taken a meeting of the 
State Operative Medical Commission. "Starting tomorrow, all patients returning from anywhere in Italy will be 
checked," Perevoscikovs said.
According to the instructions issued by the Center for Disease Prevention and Control, all persons who have 
returned from the virus stricken regions and start feeling unwell are expected to call the emergency line at 113, but 
refrain from visiting their family practitioners or hospitals in person.
It has also been decided that all patients hospitalized with severe respiratory infections and receiving intensive care 
will also be tested for Covid-19. Additional observation will be ensured if such patients have returned from trips 
outside Latvia or have had close contacts with Covid-19 patients, Perevoscikovs said.
As reported, of the 186 people tested for the coronavirus in Latvia, only one has tested positive so far.

are to be added on several existing routes, which will ensure growth also in the new year provided that the 
economic environment remains favorable.
The passenger terminal of Tallinn Airport has been designed for an annual throughput of 2.6 million passengers 
and is already operating at its limits. The airport's vision for 2035 calls for expanding the passenger terminal to be 
able to serve up to six million passengers a year.
Tuvike said that the need for a bigger terminal can be felt during the high season in the summer months already.
The CEO said that plans for additional pre-flight waiting areas and extensions of luggage handling areas are 
already in the designing stage, designing of the first stage of the extension of the passenger terminal is about to 
start soon and construction is expected to take place from 2020-2022, as a result of which the airport's throughput 
capacity and quality of service are expected to improve significantly.
Passenger numbers grew also in all of the state-owned airport company's regional airports, reaching 67,070 in total. 
The number of passengers at the airport of Tartu increased 8.5 percent on year to 28,322, Kuressaare registered 
an increase of 6.3 percent to 24,614, Kardla an increase of 17.5 percent to 11,684 and Parnu an increase of 9.7

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers up 10 pct on year in September
TALLINN, Oct 03, BNS - A total of 311,000 passengers passed through the airport of Tallinn in September, 10 
percent more than during the same month last year, passenger numbers were largest on routes from Tallinn to 
Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt and Stockholm, the state-owned airport company Tallinn Airport said.
The number of passengers carried exhibited continued growth on routes to Berlin, Stockholm and Riga.
"On routes to both Berlin and Stockholm, there is strong competition between a number of carriers, and low ticket 
prices facilitate travelling to these destinations," Eero Pargmae, commercial director of Tallinn Airport, said in a 
press release.
Pargmae said that while the winter schedule will take effect from the end of October, and Norwegian will stop 
operating flights to Stockholm and EasyJet to Berlin and Milan, intense competition will nonetheless persist on the 
said routes during low season, too.
"Routes to Berlin will be operated by AirBaltic and Ryanair and those to Stockholm by LOT/Nordica, AirBaltic and 
SAS, therefore I believe that passengers have enough opportunities to find a suitable departure and carrier on 
those routes," he said.
Passenger numbers were also boosted by Wizzair launching a direct route to Georgia in September, Tallinn Airport 
said. Altogether 36 direct flights were available from Tallinn during the month. Most popular destinations included 
Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt and Stockholm, flights to which accounted for 40 percent of passengers serviced by the

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's August passenger numbers up 6.4 pct
TALLINN, Sep 05, BNS – A total of more than 325,000 passengers passed through the airport of Tallinn in August, 
6.4 percent more than during the same month last year, the state-owned airport company Tallinn Airport said.
The number of passengers of Tartu airport increased by 722 or by as much as 34 percent year on year to 2,725 
passengers in August.
Eero Pargmae, commercial director of Tallinn Airport, said that the number of passengers grew on almost all routes, 
with the biggest increases registered in the services to Stockholm, London, Berlin and Riga.
These cities, being the destinations with the most congested traffic, also have the highest competition between air 
carriers, where growth is largely stimulated by cheap ticket prices, the CCO said.
"We are witnessing some overheating on these markets; accordingly, it may be estimated that the number of 
airlines servicing these destinations will drop during the winter season," Pargmae said.
"We are especially happy about the results of Tartu airport, where we can feel that demand has caught up with 
supply and the route has been finally included in the travel plans of the people in Tartu," Pargmae added.
The biggest carrier, Airbaltic, carried 23 percent of the total number of passengers served by the airport of Tallinn 
during August, Nordica 14 percent and Ryanair 10 percent. One-fifth of all passengers used the low-cost airline 
segment.
The average seat occupancy was 80 percent in August, compared with 76 percent in August 2018.

"These figures are a good indication of people's interest in travel, which will hopefully continue also during the 
autumn season when the percentage of those going on holiday trips decreases but those going on business trips 
increases," Pargmae said.
Direct flights were operated on 35 regular routes and to 15 charter destinations in total in August, with the key hubs 
such as Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt and Stockholm accounting for a large portion of regular traffic. The most popular 
among charter flights are holiday resorts in Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport serves record number of passengers in July
TALLINN, Aug 02, BNS – Tallinn Airport served 319,000 passengers in July, 2.2 percent more than in the same 
month the year before, marking an all-time record number of passengers served in one month.
Eero Pargmae, chief commercial officer (CCO) of Tallinn Airport, said that the result is to be expected as several 
business routes, like Copenhagen and Milan, were temporarily suspended in July. The average passenger load 
factor on regular flights rose to a record 81 percent.
"Regardless of the relatively warm summer weather in Estonia, passengers' demand for summer holiday trips has 
remained very strong and the average passenger load factor has reached a record high. With the summer, Air 
Baltic has snatched up a lot more of the market share and increased it 7 percent compared with the start of the 
year," Pargmae said in a press release.
The largest carrier, Latvian state airline Air Baltic, served 24 percent, Nordica 15 percent and Ryanair 10 percent of 
passengers in July. Altogether 20 percent of all passengers traveled with low-cost airlines.
In July, there were direct flights on 36 regular routes added to which were 25 charter flight destinations. A large part 
of regular traffic has been distributed between main connecting hubs, like Helsinki, Riga, Frankfurt and Stockholm. 
Regular flights on business routes, which were suspended in July for regular maintenance, will be restored again in 
August. Of the charter flight destinations, the most popular were resorts in Turkey, Bulgaria and Greece.
Summer passenger number records are testing the throughput of the airport's terminal. "In order to avoid delays 
and a stressful start to the journey, each passenger can help along by arriving at the airport with enough time to 
spare to hand off their luggage and go through security," Pargmae said.
The airport of Tartu, second largest city of Estonia, also saw a record number of passengers in July, 2,257 
passengers, which is 429 passengers more than in July 2018.

New passenger terminal planned at Liepaja Airport
RIGA, Jun 25, BNS - There is a plan to build a new passenger terminal at Liepaja Terminal, which might cost an 
estimated EUR 9 million, Gints Ginters, business development manager at the Liepaja Special Economic Zone 
(SEZ), told BNS.
The Liepaja SEZ representative said that the airport’s existing passenger terminal needs reconstruction to enable 
modern and convenient passenger and luggage services to the existing and future flights of Latvia’s airBaltic carrier 
and charter flights.
“The terminal is one of the preconditions for us to continue talks with Ryanair, Wizz Air, Norwegian Air and other 
carriers whose fleets consist of larger aircraft,” said Ginters, adding that the estimates costs of the terminal project 
might be around EUR 9 million.
He also noted that in the future airBaltic plans to only use its new Airbuss A220-300 airliners, which are also too big 
for the existing terminal.
Ginters pointed out that the plan is to construct the terminal as a passive building as the airport prioritizes green 
thinking and sustainable approaches.
Aviasabiedriba Liepaja, established in 1993, has a share capital of EUR 1.016 million, according to information 
available at Firmas.lv. In 2018, the airport’s operator turned over EUR 62,510, up 69.7 percent year-on-year, and 
made a EUR 7,218 profit, recovering from a loss sustained a year ago. Aviasabiedriba Liepaja belongs to the 
Liepaja City Council.

The Irish company will fly to Cologne Bonn Airport on Wednesdays and Saturday, and passengers will be flown to 
Nuremberg on Tuesdays and Saturdays during summer and winter seasons, Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian 
Airports), the airport operator in Lithuania, has announced.
According to Karolis Matulaitis, head of Kainas Airport, the decision to launch the new flights was determined by the 
fact that German giant Hella launched operations in the Kaunas Free Economic Zone last year, and a Continental 
production plant is due to be launched in the fall.
Up until now, only cargo has been flown from Cologne to Kaunas, commissioned by logistics company UPS.
Lufthansa, airBaltic, Ryanair and Wizz Air now fly from Vilnius to six German cities, and Wizz Air flies from Palanga 
to Dortmund.

Kaunas Airport expects to attract some EUR 25 mln in investments
VILNIUS, May 24, BNS - Lithuania's second-biggest international airport in Kaunas plans to expand aircraft 
maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operations, expecting to attract some 25 million euros in investments that 
would create over 400 new highly-skilled, well-paid jobs in the next few years.
"This is about developing aircraft maintenance operations; we are trying to attract developers to build hangars and 
create a MRO base," Marius Gelzinis, CEO at Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Lithuania's 
three international airports, told BNS.
"This in line with our vision of Kaunas being more a technical maintenance and cargo airport," he said.
The project will be carried out in two stages by leasing land to investors for building a total of eight hangars.
Talks are currently underway with potential developers, Gelzinis said, adding that a considerable number of 
companies, mostly those operating in Europe, are interested in investing in Kaunas.
The bases are expected to become operational in 2021 to 2022, according to the CEO.
Several MRO bases currently operate in Lithuania. FL Technics, the MRO subsidiary of Avia Solutions Group, has 
a base in Vilnius and a hangar in Kaunas, and Ireland's budget carrier Ryanair has a MRO base in the second-
biggest city.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport passenger numbers up 11.4 pct on year in April
TALLINN, May 06, BNS – Tallinn Airport served 226,000 passengers in April, 11.4 percent more than during the 
same month last year.
A 21.3 percent increase in charter flights is particularly noticeable among the number of passengers, the state-
owned airport company said. Eero Pargmae, CCO of Tallinn Airport, said that a busier Antalya charter flight 
schedule brought along a surge in the number of charter flights.
"Since mid-April, one to three flights to Antalaya per day took place, this route is serviced by altogether six carriers -
- Onur Air, Pegasus, Freebird, SmartLynx, Tailwind and Turkish Airlines," Pargmae said. New routes to Malaga and 
Minsk will be opened at the end of May and beginning of June.
Altogether 7.2 percent more seats than the year before were added to regular flights in April. Growth took place 
mainly in the low-cost air carrier segment, which also brought along an increase in the average passenger load 
factor. Compared with the same period the year before, there are now additional flights by WizzAir to Kiev and 
London, Ryanair's connections to Edinburgh and Berlin, Norwegian's flights to Stockholm and EasyJet's flights on 
the London and Milan routes. The flights that have been added help compensate for Nordica's changes in the flight 
network.
As the summer season approaches, the rush hours of flight traffic will also become busier. In terms of the number 
of flights, the busiest time was between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. when up to 13 flights per hour took place. "Summer is the 
high season of flying and the flight schedule is denser. We advise passengers to take extra time for arriving at the 
airport in order to ensure that getting on the flight is pleasant and calm," Pargmae said.
At the end of March 2018, Finnair switched to a new flight schedule at Tartu airport and, thus, the number of 
passengers who passed through the airport also increased. The number of passengers rose approximately 20 
percent year over year and 9.4 percent compared with March. "The introduction of updates takes time. The new 
Estonia : Tallinn Airport passenger numbers up 11.4 pct on year in April
schedule supports namely those flying in the direction of Europe as well as business passengers and I am glad to 
acknowledge that this route has been discovered and the number of passengers is increasing," Pargmae said.

Ryanair's Vilnius-Venice flight fails to take off due to crew shortage (media)
VILNIUS, May 02, BNS - Ryanair's Vilnius-Venice flight failed to take off from the Lithuanian capital's airport on 
Thursday morning because of a crew shortage, online news sites reported.
The 7 a.m. flight to Treviso Airport was delayed for eight hours.
Tadas Vasiliauskas, spokesman for Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Vilnius Airport, said 
the delay was due to a crew shortage.

shortages might cause more delays and cancellations during the summer season, according to 15min.lt.

VILNIUS, May 02, BNS - Ryanair's Vilnius-Venice flight failed to take off from the Lithuanian capital's airport on

LOT launching flights from Vilnius to London City
VILNIUS, Apr 30, BNS - LOT Polish Airlines is launching new direct business flights between Vilnius Airport and 
London City Airport on Wednesday.
Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of Vilnius Airport, says the new route is key to improving air 
connectivity to major financial centers and the image of Lithuania. The link is also expected to give a boost of the 
tourism, transport and service sectors.
LOT will operate a twice daily service between Vilnius and London City on weekdays and one daily flight on 
weekends during the summer season.
Lithuanian Transport and Communications Minister Rokas Masiulis has said the business community has been 
asking for the route for several years.
According to the minister, the route will be supported under a special aid mechanism, the first of its kind in Europe. 
It took two years for the government to convince the European Commission to allow Lithuania to apply such a 
mechanism.
The more seats are sold on each flight, the less it will cost the state, Masiulis said.
Economy and Innovation Minister Virginijus Sinkevicius has said that the maximum amount of state aid will not 
exceed 3 million euros annually.
Lietuvos Oro Uostai had sought to attract an airline to fly passengers to London City for several years. Last 
November, the state-owned company said it had awarded a five-contract to operate the service to LOT following a 
tender process.

Currently, flights from Lithuania's three international airports in Vilnius, Kaunas and Palanga are only operated by 
budget carriers -- Hungary's Wizz Air and Ireland's Ryanair.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport schedule to be supplemented with 11 direct destinations in April
TALLINN, Apr 02, BNS - In April, non-stop service to 11 new destinations from Tallinn Airport will be launched, 
while the total number of destinations serviced in the summer months will be 37.
New destinations this year are to include Minsk, Malaga and Kutaisi. In addition to regular flights, charter flights will 
also be serviced to 37 destinations, the state-owned airport company said.
Eero Pargmae, CCO of Tallinn Airport, said that the aviation market this year is in the midst of reorganization 
following a notable growth, thus subsequent growth can be expected to decelerate. 
"That means that several airlines are revising their strategic plans and setting new goals," Pargmae said.
In addition to 37 regular flight destinations, 37 destinations will also be serviced by charter flights with the highest 
number flying to resorts in Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria.
"In addition to Smartlynx, charter fights from Tallinn are also serviced by Finnair, Turkish Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, 
Onurair and several other airlines. Travel agencies have good offers for package trips and the route to Turkish 
resorts exhibits the most frequent charter flight traffic this summer," Pargmae said.
Starting from April 2, Ryanair will start operating flights from Tallinn to Berlin and Barcelona and from April 3 to 
Dublin. Nordica will start flying to Nice from April 13 and to Split from April 14. The carrier will also start servicing 
flights to Odessa and Ohrid in May. Aegan Airlines will start flying to Athens and Belavia to Minsk. 
Starting from June, Air Baltic will start flying to Malaga, Copenhagen and Brussels, Ellinair to Thessaloniki and 
Nordica to Constanta. From August, Wizzair will start flights to Kutaisi and Turkish Airlines will add supplementary

departures on the Istanbul route to reach a total of ten flights per week. More frequent departures will be added by

Estonia: Tallinn Airport passenger numbers up 10 pct on year in March
TALLINN, Apr 02, BNS - Tallinn Airport served 231,000 passengers in March, 10 percent more than during the 
same month last year.
In March, passenger numbers grew most on routes to London, Stockholm and Copenhagen, the state-owned 
airport company said.
Although British Airways ceased operations at the end of March, the positive trend on the London route is expected 
to continue in the summer months, when four carriers continue to service the line.
Flight operators that have increased their market share the most include low-cost carriers Ryanair, Wizzair and 
Norwegian and easyJet, which service altogether 22 percent of all passengers. The respective figure a year ago 
was 15 percent.
The most popular charter flight destinations were Egypt and the Canary Islands. 85.3 percent of regular departures 
were on time, with Wizzair, Finnair and Air Baltic being the most punctual carriers.
In 2018, Tallinn Airport reached a record high, having served over three million passengers within one year.

Ryanair cannot be fined for failure to fly Egyptian out of Lithuania, court rules
VILNIUS, Apr 01, BNS – Lithuania's State Border Guard Service had no right to issue a fine to Irish airline Ryanair 
for its refusal to fly a female Egyptian citizen, who arrived in Lithuania on a forged Greek visa, out of the country, a 
Lithuanian court ruled.
Last month, the Regional Administrative Court of Vilnius cancelled the SBGS's decision made in October to issue a 
fine of 3,000 euros to Ryanair, Sigita Jacineviciene-Baltaduone, spokeswoman for the court, told BNS Lithuania.
"The Law on the Principles of the Activities of Transport does not provide for the possibility to issue a fine for failure 
to bring a foreigner back to the foreign country, and it only provides for the possibility to demand to compensate 
costs related to the foreigner's presence at the border checkpoint and the person's return to the countries listed by 
legal acts. (…) The foreigner involved bought a ticket to leave Lithuania herself. And there was no evidence of other 
costs incurred by the SBGS in this case," she said.
The law only provides for the possibility to issue a fine to a carrier for failure to ensure that passengers have all 
necessary documents to enter Lithuania.
Ryanair says its staff checked the Egyptian passenger's documents but had no means to identify that her visa was 
forged, and the court backed the airline.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport passenger numbers up 14 pct on year in February
TALLINN, Mar 05, BNS – Tallinn Airport served 195,000 passengers in February, 14 percent more than during the 
same month last year.
The most popular direct route in February was Tallinn-Stockholm, which is serviced by four air carriers, including 
Nordica, Air Baltic, SAS and Norwegian Air. Over the 28 days of last month, over 20,000 passenger or 
approximately 40 percent more than the year before flew between the capitals of Estonia and Sweden, the airport 
said.
Eero Pargmae, CCO of Tallinn Airport, said that the kind of increase in the popularity of the Stockholm route can be 
explained by the increase in supply and, consequently, the prices becoming more affordable. "The importance of 
Stockholm as an major hub has increased and will likely increase further as up to nine flights per day fly to Arlanda 
Airport," he said in a press release.
Besides Sweden, the increase in passenger numbers continued on most direct routes, the destinations of which 
number 25. Decline occurred mainly in connection with Nordica's discontinuation of flights to St. Petersburg and 
route network changes in the direction of Munich and Amsterdam.
The largest air carrier in Tallinn was Air Baltic, additional passengers have also been brought in by low-cost carriers 
Ryanair, Wizz Air and Norwegian.
"In January and February, the number of passengers has increased by 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, 
which has been a positive surprise for us and shows the continued growth in demand," Pargmae added.
According to Pargmae, more important than figures is the fact that Nordica's slight retreat has not delivered a 
setback to passenger numbers and through alternative solutions, the airport has actually been able to increase the 
number of seats.
Estonia : Tallinn Airport passenger numbers up 14 pct on year in February
In 2018, Tallinn Airport saw a record number of passengers and the 3 million mark was exceeded on the last day of 
the year, which means an average of 8,200 passengers and 60 flights per day passed through the airport that year.

Court orders flyLAL, Air Baltic dispute to be heard in Lithuania
VILNIUS, Feb 13, BNS - Bankrupt airline flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines' dispute with Latvian air carrier Air Baltic and 
Riga Airport over alleged competition violation and damages must be heard by court in Lithuania as well, the Court 
of Appeal of Lithuania ruled on Tuesday.
It said Lithuanian courts have the jurisdiction to hear the dispute under EU law over the location of the damage 
involved and also under the rule that a dispute related to a subsidiary might be heard by local courts.
The dispute between flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines and Air Baltic and Riga Airport can be heard by both Lithuanian and 
Latvian courts, and the final ruling will have to be issued by the Court of Appeal of Lithuania, taking into 
consideration the circumstances of the damage incurred, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July.
The dispute between flyLAL and Air Baltic Corporation and Riga Airport was sparked more than a decade ago by 
an alleged violation of the competition law and damage. flyLAL is asking for the compensation of damage caused 
by Air Baltic and Riga Airport's alleged illicit discount agreement at Riga Airport. flyLAL claims it was pushed out of 
the flight market due to Air Baltic's predatory pricing at Vilnius Airport.
After seven years of litigation, Vilnius Regional Court ruled in January, 2016 that Air Baltic must pay 16.121 million 
euros in damages to flyLAL. And Riga Airport, which gave Air Baltic discounts, then avoided responsibility.
Since flyLAL's claim against Riga Airport was heard during closed-door court sitting, it is not known why Riga 
Airport is not obliged to pay any compensation to the Lithuanian company.
Latvia's competition watchdog concluded in 2006 that Riga Airport's discount distorted the market and were 
beneficial for two companies – Air Baltic and Ireland's Ryanair.

Latvia's competition watchdog concluded in 2006 that Riga Airport's discount distorted the market and were 
beneficial for two companies – Air Baltic and Ireland's Ryanair.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport passenger numbers continue fast growth also in January
TALLINN, Feb 05, BNS – Tallinn Airport served over 200,000 passengers in January, 17 percent more than during 
the same month last year.
Compared with January 2018, the number of passengers of Air Baltic and Ryanair increased the most. As of 
January, Air Baltic is flying to nine direct destinations from Tallinn, while Ryanair flies to six. Of the direct 
destinations, the most popular were Helsinki, Stockholm and Riga, the state-owned airport company said.
Over the last year, the number of passengers has increased most on the Stockholm route, which saw an average of 
seven flights per day in January. "There is close competition on this route -- while last year, two carriers flew 
between the Swedish capital and Tallinn, then now, the number of airlines on the route is four. This gives 
passengers more flight times and better layover possibilities, but also cheaper ticket prices," Tallinn Airport CCO 
Eero Pargmae said.
The number of charter passengers rose 21 percent on year in January. As is customary for the season, the most 
popular destinations were Egypt, the Canary Islands, Dubai and the ski resorts of the Alps.
Pargmae added that this year's long holidays and school holidays contributed to the significant increase in the 
number of passengers. "All in all, January was a better than expected month in terms of passenger numbers, this 
shows that the economic climate is still positive, people's confidence is good and demand remains strong with the 
support of that," he said.
In 2018, passenger numbers at Tallinn Airport grew by 13.6 percent to an all-time high of 3 million. In January, the 
airport said that it is estimating that the increase in passenger numbers is to decelerate to approximately 5 percent 
this year.

Ryanair to start flying from Tallinn to Berlin Schonefeld in spring
TALLINN, Jan 04, BNS – The Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair is about to launch a new service between Tallinn and 
Berlin Schonefeld in April.
The flights will take place three times a week during the summer flight schedule, the airline said. 
The CCO of Tallinn Airport, Eero Pargmae, said that Germany is an important market for business and holiday 
travelers alike and the airport company welcomes the additional possibility to fly to Berlin.
The latest addition to Ryanair's services to and from Tallinn was the Tallinn-Edinburgh line launched upon the 
introduction of the winter schedule. In winter, Ryanair also flies from Tallinn to Paphos, Malta, Milan, Dusseldorf, 
and London Stansted.

Normal flight frequency to continue on Tallinn-Russia routes during holidays
TALLINN, Dec 07 - Aviation companies do not intend to add departures on routes from Tallinn Airport to Russia 
during the upcoming holidays and turn of the year.
The Russian company Aeroflot currently departs from Tallinn to Moscow three times a day. 
Tallinn Airport spokesperson Margot Holts told BNS on Friday that this is a good frequency, which manages to 
service a large part of the tourists arriving in Estonia. Should the need arise, the carrier can put a larger airplane on 
the route on the days where passenger numbers are up, Holts said.
The national airline of Estonia operating under the Nordica brand departs from Tallinn to St. Petersburg daily during 
the holidays and the turn of the year. Due to cuts in routes announced by the company earlier, the last flight on the 
route will depart on Jan. 13.
Thus, relatively normal frequency of flights towards Russia will continue during the holidays. The Irish low cost 
carrier Ryanair, however, will add some flights on the Tallinn-London route during the period.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's Jan-Nov passenger numbers hit new record in 2018
TALLINN, Dec 05, BNS - The number of passengers that passed through Tallinn Airport in the first 11 months of 
2018 grew 13.3 percent on year to 2.8 million, which means that the record reached last year, when the airport 
serviced 2.6 million passengers, has been beaten.
In November 2018, the number of passengers serviced at Tallinn Airport totaled 227,000, which marks a 12 percent 
increase compared to the same month last year. The number of passengers on international flights amounted to 
224,800 and those on domestic flights to 2,200. Nearly 204,000 passengers passed through the airport on regular 
flights and 23,000 on non-regular flights. The number of flight operations grew by 7.4 percent year over year to 
3,800. Of the flight operations, 3,400 were commercial flights and 400 other flights, the state-owned airport 
company said.
Despite the seasonal decrease in passenger numbers, the growth indicates continued demand both in the charter 
as well as regular flights segment. In November, 27 destinations could be reached from Tallinn Airport, serviced by 
13 aviation companies. Last year, the numbers were 26 and 12, respectively.
Air Baltic and Ryanair were the ones to attract the most additional passengers in November. In yearly comparison, 
however, the largest growth was induced by the Estonian state-owned airline Nordica, which in recent months has 
seen a decline due to planned cuts in flight plans. Based on growth in passenger numbers, Norwegian has taken 
the largest leap, having grown its number of passengers by more that 50 percent since the beginning of the year.
The largest number of seats compared to last year was added on the Tallinn-Stockholm route, on which in addition 
to Nordica and SAS, Norwegian and Air Baltic also started providing their services. Due to additional flights, the 
number of seats also increased on routes to London, Copenhagen, Kiev and Istanbul. This year, routes were also 
opened to Malta, Paphos and Edinburgh.
Estonia : Tallinn Airport's Jan-Nov passenger numbers hit new record in 2018
The number of Nordica's flights and seats has decreased on routes to Vilnius, St. Petersburg, Munich and Brussels. 
In addition to the planned pause in seasonal flights for the winter, Nordica also closed down the route to Goteborg.
In November, the season for charter flights to Turkey was concluded and replaced with warmer destinations in 
Northern Africa. In yearly comparison, the number of charter flights to Egypt increased significantly.
A record number of 2.6 million passengers passed through Tallinn Airport last year, marking a 19 percent increase 
compared to 2016.
The Tallinn Airport Group operates the Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport, Kardla Airport, Kuressaare Airport, Tartu 
Airport, Parnu Airport, Ruhnu Airport and Kihnu Airport. The subsidiary AS Tallinn Airport GH, which provides 
ground handling services to airlines, also belongs to the Tallinn Airport Group.

Lithuanian airports offer 8 new destinations
VILNIUS, Oct 30, BNS - Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports, or LOU), the operator of the country's three 
international airports, has offered eight new flight destinations and additional flights on some routes for the winter 
season launched last weekend. 
Aurimas Stikliunas, head of aviation services at LOU, expects passenger traffic to continue its upward trend in the 
winter season after a very successful summer season that saw 4 million passengers go through the three airports. 
"This year's winter season is exceptional in that we offer both new destinations and new countries. For example, 
there will be a direct link between Vilnius Airport and Jordan's capital of Amman. Also, there will be a new service 
from Vilnius to Lvov," he said in a press release. 
Wizz Air will fly passengers to Lvov, in Ukraine, and Ryanair will offer flights from Vilnius to Kiev and Tel Aviv. Both 
airlines will also operate flights to Amman and Treviso, in Italy. 
Air Baltic will operate larger aircraft to Amsterdam, Munich, Berlin and Paris, and Norwegian Air will add more flights 
to Stockholm.
LOU offers flights to a total of 66 destinations during the winter season, including 55 from Vilnius, 19 from Kaunas 
and five from Palanga.
The three airports handled 5.2 million passengers and 55,000 flights last year.

TALLINN, Oct 29, BNS – The Irish low cost carrier Ryanair on Monday launched a direct route between the

This is the first Tallinn winter 2018 route that the carrier will launch, Ryanair said.

Paphos twice a week and to Malta once a week will also take place during the winter period.

Civil aviation business faces time of painful change, Lithuanian daily warns  (media)
VILNIUS, Oct 25, BNS - The restructuring of Lithuania's leisure operator Small Planet Airlines comes after three 
airlines in Europe have ceased their operations, with some market players and experts warning that the near-term 
period may be particularly hard for some carriers, the business daily Verslo Zinios reported on Thursday. 
According to the paper, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary predicted at the start of the year that some airlines would 
"not survive the winter" due to rising fuel prices. 
Gediminas Ziemelis, a Lithuanian businessman who controls Avia Solutions Group, said in September that at least 
five medium-sized European airlines might go bust within the next 12 months due both to increasing fuel prices and 
to a shortage of pilots. 
Small Planet Airlines announced earlier this week that it had filed for restructuring in Lithuania after launching 
the restructuring of its Polish and German subsidiaries due to financial difficulties. 
The group said in a press release that the Lithuanian company could "survive" without an investor, but it is looking 
for one. 
It underlined that "there is a major difference between restructuring in Polish and German companies, and in 
Lithuania" and that the restructuring process would not affect its flights from Lithuania and foreign bases.

airBaltic CEO doesn't consider Nordica a major competitor
TALLINN, Oct 2, BNS --BNS – The CEO of the Latvian state-owned airline airBaltic, Martin Gauss, does not regard 
the Estonian counterpart Nordic Aviation Group which operates under the Nordica brand as a major competitor for 
airBaltic and views it rather as an extension of Polish carrier LOT, Eesti Paevaleht said.
"Flights by Nordica are not really an argument when we consider whether to open a specific route or not. When it 
comes to flights out of Tallinn, Nordica is someone to be reckoned with, but our number one competitor is Ryanair, 
followed by Wizzair and Norwegian," Gaus said according to remarks published in Estonian.
Gauss described Nordica as not actually an Estonian airline, but an extension of Poland's LOT, which does 
business-wise what LOT wants. Gauss also said that LOT is not a serious competitor to airBaltic, even though they 
are very strong in Poland and globally.
"What matters to us is whether a line makes sense, not whether someone is flying there already. We will not open a 
line when we are not sure that we can make money with it. To my knowledge, five airlines are flying from Tallinn to 
London. The line has been profitable for us from the start. On some lines there's a lot of room for competition, and 
there are lines where it's better to be flying alone," he said.
According to Gauss, airBaltic's market share in Estonia last month was 16 percent compared with Nordica's 20 
percent.
"Every month we raise the number of our passengers in Estonia by at least 10 percent year over year. Since were 
are launching flights to new destinations, growth will continue," he said.
The Latvian airline at present flies to six destinations from Tallinn and is about to add three destinations. In 2019, 
the company will be flying directly to 12 destinations from the capital of Estonia.
airBaltic CEO doesn't consider Nordica a major competitor
"Next year, we will launch flights to Malaga, Brussels and Copenhagen. In addition to adding destinations we will 
add frequencies to existing destinations," Gauss said.
He said that in its previous business plan for 2021, the company expected to fly to 11 destinations from Estonia, as 
it didn't expect Estonian Air to continue flying under a different name.
"Competition is good for customers. Our market share in the Baltic countries taken together is about 36 percent. In 
Latvia it is 56 percent and in Lithuania less than 10 percent. In Lithuania Ryanair and Wizzair are flying too," the 
airBaltic CEO said.
According to the CEO, the Latvian carrier expects its passenger numbers to grow by 20 percent this year and by 
another as much in 2019.

He said that in its previous business plan for 2021, the company expected to fly to 11 destinations from Estonia, as 
it didn't expect Estonian Air to continue flying under a different name.
"Competition is good for customers. Our market share in the Baltic countries taken together is about 36 percent. In 
Latvia it is 56 percent and in Lithuania less than 10 percent. In Lithuania Ryanair and Wizzair are flying too," the Air 
Baltic CEO said.
According to the CEO, the Latvian carrier expects its passenger numbers to grow by 20 percent this year and by 
another as much in 2019.

Lithuania's Air Navigation mulls increasing airspace capacity as flight numbers grow
VILNIUS, Oct 02, BNS – Lithuania's state-run company Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation) is looking into ways to 
increase the country's airspace capacity as the number of flights grows.
"Taking into account the growing number of flights and their potential further increase next year, the company plans 
to reform the airspace structure soon. We are analyzing opportunities to open additional flight management 
sectors," the company's CEO Mindaugas Gustys was quoted as saying in a statement.
An additional flight management sector was already introduced in June, and Lithuania's upper airspace from 10 to 
20 km was split into two sectors, which allowed to double airspace capacity to 90 planes per hour and avoid 
potential plane delays.
Oro Navigacija has serviced 204,200 flights this year, up 10 percent form January-September of 2017, with three 
fourths being transit flight (9.7 percent more).
Five air companies, including Finland's Finnair, Latvia's Air Baltic, Russia's Aeroflot, Germany's Lufthansa and 
Ireland's Ryanair have performed the majority of flights in Lithuania's airspace this year
Over 900 air companies include Lithuania's airspace into their routs.

Ryanair strike will not impact flights to and from Riga
RIGA, Sep 27, BNS - Tomorrow's strike by cabin crew of the Irish low-fare airline Ryanair will not impact flights to 
and from Riga, BNS was informed by Riga International Airport spokeswoman Laura Karnite.
''There are no changes in Ryanair's scheduled flights to and from Riga tomorrow, and so far none are being 
planned,'' she said.
The AFP news agency reports that Ryanair will axe 150 flights scheduled Friday when cabin crews strike across 
Europe, the Irish no-frills airline said Wednesday, lowering its previous estimate of 190.
The Dublin-based carrier said in a statement that it would now cancel six percent of flights amid the walk-outs in 
Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
"The number of flights cancelled this Friday, 28 September, has been reduced to 150 from... 190 as the vast 
majority of our people will work as normal," Ryanair said in the brief statement.
The vast majority of its 2,400 flights on Friday "will be unaffected by these unnecessary strikes and will operate as 
scheduled", it added.
Trade unions have claimed that Friday's 24-hour stoppage will be the biggest strike in the Irish carrier's history.
Ryanair staff have been seeking higher wages and an end to the practice whereby many have been working as 
independent contractors without the benefits of staff employees.
Another key complaint of workers based in countries other than Ireland is the fact that Ryanair has been employing 
them under Irish legislation.
Staff claim this creates huge insecurity for them, blocking their access to state benefits in their country.
Ryanair strike will not impact flights to and from Riga
Last month, Ryanair pilots across Europe staged a coordinated 24-hour strike to push their demands for better pay 
and conditions, plunging tens of thousands of passengers into transport chaos at the peak of the busy summer 
season.
In July, strikes by cockpit and cabin crew disrupted 600 flights in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, 
affecting 100,000 travellers.
This week meanwhile, Ryanair signed deals with cabin crew unions in Italy to provide employment contracts under 
Italian law.

Vilnius-London City Airport flights could be launched in spring – econmin (updates)
VILNIUS, Jul 12, BNS – A direct flight between Vilnius and London City Airport might be launched in the spring, 
Lithuanian Economy Minister Virginijus Sinkevicius says.
"We've been seeking a business flight to London. We've considered Heathrow but they don’t have free times there, 
so London City Airport was chosen. We have lost quite a few investments due a lack of air service between London 
and Vilnius. London is a key route investors mention when they speak about investment challenges in Lithuania," 
the economy minister told BNS Lithuania.
On Wednesday, Economy Minister Virginijus Sinkevicius and Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis, currently 
substituting for Environment Minister Kestutis Navickas, signed an order on the establishment of a flight between 
Vilnius and London City Airport, which is vital for the economic and social development of the country.
According to Sinkevicius, a competition will be launched in September for an air carrier to operate regular 6–12 
flights on this route a week. Flight should take place the whole year and tickets should be sold at market prices.
Currently, only low-cost airlines – Hungary's Wizz Air and Ireland's Ryanair – operate flights from Vilnius to 
London's airports of Luton and Stansted.

CEO: Enlargement of Airbaltic to underpin Nordica's regional operations
TALLINN, May 28, BNS – The Estonian state-owned airline Nordica, which operates under the Nordica brand, finds 
that the decision of Airbaltic to buy up to 60 brand new Bombardier CS300 aircraft may signal the Latvian rival's 
entry into the low-cost market, which would offer Nordica an opportunity to become stronger in the business area of 
regional flights.
The CEO of Nordic Aviation Group, Jaan Tamm, said on Monday that Airbaltic's choice in favor of CS300 and the 
number of aircraft to be bought indicate that the airline is about to move into the large scale passenger haulage 
market where companies such as Norwegian, Ryanair, Wizzair, EasyJet and many others are operating already.
"It definitely isn't going to be easy, but I wish them success," Tamm told BNS.
"If we look at Nordica in this context, this is good news and a good development for us, since our competitor in the 
immediate region is from now on focusing on a market area different from ours, which will give us an opportunity to 
become stronger still in our area of business -- operating regional aircraft. It would be very fine if there was one 
strong low-cost carrier and one strong company offering regional flights in the Baltics," Tamm said.
Tamm added that, as a rule, it is leasing companies that buy planes for airlines.
"Aside from the size of the planned transaction and the number of aircraft, the question what kind of business will 
be conducted with these aircraft interests me more as the manager of an airline company," Tamm said.
"It is quite obvious that such a number of flying craft is more than there is room for in the Baltic region. Too few 
people live here for an investment like this to be put to work and to pay back," he added.
Airbaltic announced on Monday that it is about to place an order for up to 60 brand new Bombardier CS300 aircraft 
for an estimated up to 4.8 billion euros.
CEO: Enlargement of Airbaltic to underpin Nordica 's regional operations
Airbaltic's revenue in 2017 grew 22 percent year over year to 347.7 million euros and its profit tripled to 4.6 million

Lithuania's Air Navigation to transfer EUR 0.5 mln to state coffers
VILNIUS, May 03, BNS - Lithuania's state-owned air navigation service provider Oro Navigacija (Air Navigation) is 
set to transfer 0.5 million euros out of its 2017 net profit of 1.5 million euros to the public coffers, marking the first

Oro Navigacija said that the Transport Ministry, its shareholder, on Monday approved the management board's 
proposal.
"Although the company's operations are strictly regulated by international law and it does not receive any funding 
from the state budget, this year we will for the first time contribute to the state budget," Oro Navigacija CEO

The company's net profit surged by 350 percent in 2017 compared with 2016 to reach 1.509 million euros. Revenue 
increased by 1.8 percent to 29.236 million euros.

Estonia: Tallinn Airport's passenger numbers grow 13.8 pct on year in Q1
TALLINN, Apr 06, BNS – The number of passengers that passed through Tallinn Airport in the first quarter of 2018 
grew 13.8 percent on year to 556,000 passengers.
The number of passengers in March climbed 14 percent to 210,000, the airport said.
Eero Pargmae, CCO of the airport company, said that the number of passengers has increased at a stable rate 
during the entire first quarter across nearly all destinations.
"This indicates that this is a broad-based and sustainable development, not a campaign-based jump in the number 
of passengers," Pargmae said.
Nordica, Airbaltic and SmartLynx have contributed the most to the number of passengers. The number of charter 
passengers is increasing at a noticeable rate and has increased 27 percent compared to the year before. As is 
customary for the winter season, the most popular charter flight destinations were Egypt and the Canary Islands.
Tallinn Airport from the end of March has been operating on a summer flight schedule, which will bring along 
significant flight traffic growth. Ryanair opened new year-round routes to Malta and Cyprus, while the same air 
carrier also restored seasonal routes to Girona, Bremen and Dublin. Airbaltic opened a new flight connection from 
Tallinn to Gatwick Airport in London. The number of destinations that can be directly flown to from Tallinn is 30 as at 
the end of March.
Altogether 2.6 million passengers passed through Tallinn Airport in 2017, marking a new all-time high and an 
increase of 19 percent over the previous year.

Ryanair eyeing Estonia, Latvia due to Lithuania's high prices
VILNIUS, Mar 02, BNS – The plan of the Lithuanian national operator of airports Lietuvos Oro Uostai to raise prices 
may affect Ryanair's plans to establish bases in the country, the Irish low cost carrier announced on Thursday, a 
day after the statement that the carrier is planning to establish a base in Tallinn or Riga.
"In the next two to three years, we will allocated at least five additional aircraft to the Baltics. The market conditions 
of all three countries are similar and I must decide where. What will likely definitely be decisive, is the price. If it 
continues to grow in Lithuania, it will put Lithuania in an unfavorable situation," Ryanair CCO David O'Brien said in 
Vilnius.
He said that increasing fees of Vilnius Airport are making it less competitive in the region. "I think that this is a step 
toward a smaller competitiveness. I will not pretend that the prices in Vilnius, Riga and Tallinn are scandalously high 
compared to Heathrow or Gatwick, but it is important that you maintain your competitiveness," he said.
Ryanair currently has bases at Vilnius and Kaunas airport, where they keep two aircraft each. The carrier also has a 
maintenance center in Kaunas. Ryanair has no aircraft permanently in Riga and Tallinn.
Vilnius Airport from April will increase the fees demanded from airlines, the reason given for that was the increasing 
prices of airspace.
Ryanair on Wednesday announced that it is planning to establish a permanent base in either Tallinn or Riga or in 
both cities in the next two or three years, where ideally would be five aircraft. At present the airline has 87 bases 
across Europe and it operates in 212 airports.

Vilnius airport fees may revise Ryanair plans
VILNIUS, Mar 01, BNS – The decision taken by Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the state-run operator of 
the country's three passenger airports, may revise the plans of Ireland's Ryanair budget airline on development of a 
aircraft base in the country.  "Over the next two or three years, we will be allocating at least five more aircraft into 
the Baltic states. 
The decisions that I have to make is where and there are similar characteristics to markets in all three countries. 
What will probably and almost certainly determine where the aircraft will go is the price. If the trajectory remains 
upwards in Lithuania, that puts Lithuania at a disadvantage," David O'Brien, commercial director at Ryanair, told a 
news conference on Thursday. In his words, the growing Vilnius airport fees make it less competitive in the region.  
"My opinion is that it is a step towards uncompetitiveness. I am not going to pretend that prices in Vilnius, Riga and 
Tallinn are outrageously high compared to Heathrow or Gatwick but it important that you retain your 
competitiveness," said O'Brien. Ryanair currently has airplane bases in Vilnius and Kaunas where it stores two 
aircraft each. The company has no airplanes in Riga or Tallinn. Furthermore, the company operates a maintenance 
and technical service center in Kaunas.  The Vilnius airport is raising fees for airlines starting April, with growing air 
gateway costs indicated as the main reason behind the decision. Vilnius newsroom, verslas@bns.lt, +370 5 205

TALLINN, Feb 28, BNS – The Irish low cost carrier Ryanair is planning to establish a permanent base in Tallinn in 
the next two or three years, Ryanair CCO David O'Brien said at a press conference in Tallinn on Wednesday.
According to O'Brien, ideally there would be five aircraft in Tallinn and the company is also planning to establish a

Brexit.

season -- to Edinburgh, Paphos and Malta. Flights to Edinburgh and Paphos would take place twice a week and to 
Malta once a week. The total number of the airline's destinations out of Tallinn is to increase to six in the winter 
season, including to Milan, Dusseldorf and London.

EU court's opinion: flyLAL-airBaltic dispute can be heard in Lithuania 
VILNIUS, Feb 28, BNS - The advocate general of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) thinks that a dispute 
between the bankrupt flyLAL-Lithuanian Airlines and Latvia's airBaltic and Riga Airport can be heard in Lithuanian 
courts.
The Lithuanian Court of Appeals in January 2017 asked the ECJ for a preliminary ruling on whether the dispute can 
be heard in Lithuania, rather than in Latvia where the  defendants, airBaltic and Riga Airport, are domiciled.
Advocate General Michal Bobek on Wednesday published his opinion, which is yet to be approved by the EU court.
The Lithuanian Court of Appeals put three questions to the ECJ related to the place where the harmful event 
occurred.
In Bobek's opinion, both Lithuania, where airBaltic's branch operated, and Latvia, where the Latvian airline and Riga 
Airport concluded the alleged anti-competitive agreement, can be considered as the place of the event giving rise to 
the damage.
"As regards the alleged anti-competitive agreement between airBaltic and Riga Airport (...),  the place of the event 
giving rise to the harm (that is, the loss of sales by flyLAL), is the place of the conclusion of the agreement. 
Assuming all other conditions are fulfilled, the courts of that place would have jurisdiction (...) to hear an action 
against both those entities for damages caused by that anti-competitive agreement," the advocate general said.
"As regards the alleged predatory pricing by airBaltic (...), the place of the event giving rise to the harm is the place 
where the predatory prices were offered and applied. Assuming all other conditions are fulfilled, the courts of that 
place would have jurisdiction (...) to hear an action against airBaltic for damages caused by that predatory pricing", " 
he said. 
EU court's opinion: flyLAL-airBaltic dispute can be heard in Lithuania
FlyLAL sued airBaltic and Riga Airport for damages due to their alleged agreement on lower prices at the Latvian 
airport. FlyLAL claims that airBaltic's alleged predatory pricing in Vilnius Airport ousted it from the flight market.
Following around seven years of litigation, the Vilnius Regional Court in January 2016 ordered airBaltic to pay 
16.121 million euros in damages to flyLAL.
Latvia's competition authority ruled back in 2006 that discounts offered by Riga Airport distorted the market and 
favored two companies -- airBaltic and Ireland's Ryanair.

Riga airport shows 20% increase of passengers, 90% rise in cargos in January
RIGA, Feb 8, BNS - Riga International Airport closed January 2018 with a 20 percent increase in the number of 
passengers while cargos grew by almost 90 percent compared to January 2017, according to the airport's 
preliminary data.
In January this year, the Riga airport served 443,524 passengers, which is a 20 percent rise compared to the same 
month in 2017, and cargo handling grew 87.3 percent year-on-year to 2,464 tons. The number of flights handled by 
the airport in January 2018 increased 18 percent from January 2017 to 6,037.
"The increase in the passenger numbers was first of all facilitated by the exciting winter destinations from Riga 
Airport, which offer our travelers a wide range of options. They can enjoy winter activities or easily get to a sunny 
resort, or go on a business trip to any of Europe's big air traffic hubs," said Ilona Lice, CEO of Riga International 
Airport.
"The flow of transit and transfer passengers also keeps growing. In January, the number of transit passengers 
travelling through Riga increased by 24.1 percent," she said.
The offer of the airlines operating at Riga Airport for the summer season of 2018 allows forecasting a further 
increase in the passenger numbers. According to Lice, airlines have already announced opening of 13 new 
destinations from Riga Airport this summer, and the total number of destinations will thus reach 96. It will be the 
widest network of routes in the history of Riga Airport.
New destinations in the summer season of 2018 (it will start in March, together with the transition to the summer 
time) will be launched by the national airline airBaltic, which will operate flights to Lisbon, Malaga, Split, Gdansk, 
Bordeaux, Sochi, Kaliningrad and Almaty. The Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will start flights to Girona, Paphos and

Kaunas mayor: Continental's decision to invest in Lithuania sends worldwide message
VILNIUS, Oct 30, BNS – The decision taken by Germany's automotive giant Continental to invest 95 million euros 
in a factory in Lithuania's second-largest city Kaunas sends a message to other investors about how attractive 
Kaunas is, says the city's Mayor Visvaldas Matijosaitis.
"We can go to every global investment fair and tell about the Kaunas region being a growing industrial hub. We can 
send sell-designed presentations to every company interested in Kaunas or Lithuania with argumentation of why 
Kaunas is attractive for investors. But this is nothing, as compared to the message sent by the decision to come to 
Kaunas by a company of the size of Continental. Our team views this as the most significant victory for Kaunas, the 
fastest-growing city in Lithuania," Matijosaitis said in a comment to BNS.
In his words, the day of announcement of Continental's arrival in Kaunas can be viewed as historic. The importance 
of German company's investments also lies in creation of 1,000 jobs for skilled workers, furthermore, the company 
will become one of the biggest tax-payers.
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that the Continental factory will be the biggest foreign direct investment 
project in Lithuania's history, adding that the German company's decision to build a factory in Lithuania would be a 
major step for the automotive industry in Lithuania.
Continental is likely to settle in the Kaunas free economic zone (FEZ) close to the Kaunas airport, which offers 
Ryanair and Wizzair flights to 17 cities in Europe and the Middle East. Kaunas is 100 km from Vilnius, the two cities 
are connected by a highway and a railway line.
Kaunas FEZ already includes or about to accommodate many investors. Earlier in October, another German 
automotive giant Hella started constructing a 30-million-euro factory here, Finland's Fortum and the Lithuanian

British fighter jets accompany airliner from Lithuania after bomb hoax
VILNIUS, Oct 04, BNS – Great Britain's fighter-jets were scrambled on Wednesday to accompany Ryanair 
passenger airliner en route from Kaunas to London following a hoax call received in Lithuania about an explosive 
aboard the plane, Lithuanian police said.
The airliner was directed from Luton to Stansted airport for security reasons.
"A call was received on the emergency number at 6:21 a.m. A male caller said that there was a bomb on the 
airplane flying from Kaunas to Luton at 7 a.m. An investigation was opened and authorities are working to establish 
the caller. As far as I know, the airliner took off behind schedule," Odeta Vaitkeviciene, spokeswoman for the 
Kaunas county police, told BNS.
In her words, the Kaunas airport was notified about the call and take-off was allowed after establishing that the call 
had been a hoax.
Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the company that operates Lithuania's three commercial airports in 
Vilnius, Kaunas and Palanga, said it had received information from the Kaunas police on Wednesday morning 
about an airliner with an explosive aboard about to land in the airport, although no arrivals were scheduled at the 
time. The only people in the Kaunas terminal were the passengers for the 7:30 a.m. Ryanai flight from Kaunas to 
Luton. The police and airport staff along with the Ryanair crew decided to check the airliner.
"As no suspicious items were discovered at the terminal or the airliner, we decided to allow the airplane to conduct 
the flight from Kaunas to the Luton airport in London. The airliner took off safely at 8:06 a.m.," Lietuvos Oro Uostai 
said in a press release.
The police said an investigation was in progress.

Estonian vice minister represents presidency in European Parliament
TALLINN, Oct 04, BNS - Estonia's Deputy Minister for EU Affairs Matti Maasikas on Wednesday participated in 
debates on preparations for the European Council at the European Parliament plenary in Strasbourg, which he 
attended on behalf of the presidency of the Council of the EU.
"Constantly evolving digital solutions change and influence the lives of all and it is best to adapt to changes and use 
the new digital opportunities to improve the well-being of citizens and develop companies," Maasikas said 
according to spokespeople for the Estonian Foreign Ministry.
He said the Tallinn Digital Summit last Friday confirmed government leaders' desire to move forward with digital 
Europe and address the matter more thoroughly at the Council.
Speaking about migration, the deputy minister said that targeted action and negotiations with countries of origin 
have produced good results -- migration flows have decreased significantly. "Close cooperation between the 
member states and third countries and addressing the root causes of migration are the only ways to contain and 
regulate immigration," he said. 
At Tuesday's plenary debate on the state of play of negotiations with the United Kingdom, the Estonian deputy 
minister emphasized that there are three very serious matters, namely citizens' rights, fiscal obligations and the 
Irish border, that have to be resolved to achieve any progress. According to Maasikas, the recent speech by Prime 
Minister Theresa May signalled a desire to move forward with the negotiations, but the results of negotiations can 
only be assessed based on what has been decided at the negotiating table.
Other topics on the agenda were the UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn taking place in November and air 
passenger rights. Airline company Ryanair cancelled thousands of flights in September, which threw passengers' 
travel plans into serious disarray. Maasikas says that an airline company operating in the EU must follow EU law 
and companies that cancel flights must inform their clients of their rights.
Estonian vice minister represents presidency in European Parliament
Maasikas will also represent the presidency in discussions on the fiscal compact and Interpol arrest warrants on 
Wednesday afternoon. The debate on the fiscal compact concerns its incorporation into the EU legal framework. In 
December, the Commission will present legislative proposals on the future of the European monetary union that will 
include proposals for the fiscal compact.
On Oct. 20, the European Council will discuss migration, closer defense cooperation, external relations and digital 
Europe.

Four flights cancelled in Latvia
By the end of October, Irish low-cost airline Ryanair will cancel about 50 flights every day, which is 2 percent of the 
total number of the airline's flights. This decision has affected a small number of Latvian passengers - just four 
flights on the Riga-London route have been affected. "The number of cancelled flights is small, therefore this 
situation has not caused any inconvenience for our airport, and the airline has taken care of the passengers," said

Riga Airport has no information on Ryanair's new cancellation plans
LONDON, Sep 27, BNS/AFP - Irish low-costs carrier Ryanair today announced new flight cancellations that will last 
until March and will affect some 400,000 passengers, but it is not clear if any flights from Riga might be grounded 
as well.
The airline said the cancellations were caused by a shortage of pilots.
Ryanair representatives said that during the winter season its fleet will be reduced by 25 airliners, which is expected 
to affect less than 1 percent of the airline’s clients.
Ryanair will further cut the number of its aircraft by ten in April.
The latest announcement, affecting 34 routes, will deepen the cancellation crisis that has been plaguing Ryanair 
operations since mid-September.
Riga International Airport said it had not information yet as to whether the cancellation plans will also affect 
Ryanair’s routes from Riga.
Ryanair has already cancelled 2,100 flights in six weeks until the end of October.

pilot holiday schedules. The airline has apologized to its passengers and promised to do everything possible to 
agree on alternative flights or refunds.
However, foreign media are reporting that Ryanair is lacking pilots, as its competitor Norwegian Air Shuttle has 
attracted many Ryanair pilots to its airline.

The current market situation makes banks change and look for ways to survive. Changes can be seen among those 
banks who serve local customers, and also those who focus on international customers - the number of banks 
serving local clients is shrinking, while deposits are declining in the sector serving non-residents. Considering 
increase of financial technologies companies in the sector, it is expected that the number of banks will drop further.

Ryanair causes fuss
Ryainair's decision to cancel flights has caused trouble to 400,000 Europeans, also Latvians have to worry about 
their holiday and business plans. There have been situations earlier when an airline has to cancel a number of 
flights, but usually there has been a good reason, such as a volcano eruption in Iceland in 2010, or systematic pilot 
strikes in Lufthansa airline last year, but Ryanair's case excels with no proper reason and irresponsible 
management. This year 140 pilots left job in Ryanair and went to work in Norway, while other pilots have to take 
their annual vacations.

Passenger flow via Lithuanian airports down 14 pct in July y/y, Kaunas sets records
VILNIUS, Aug 10, BNS – Lithuania's international airports of Vilnius, Kaunas and Palanga handled an aggregate of 
407,900 passengers in July, down by 14 percent, from 472,500, year-on-year. The decline was mainly due to 
closure of the Vilnius airport for reconstruction.
"We recorded a decline in passenger numbers in July, however, airports of Lithuania posted a 15-percent growth in 
the first half of the year," Gediminas Almantas, CEO of Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of 
the airports of Vilnius, Kaunas and Palanga, said in a press release.
After the start of runway reconstruction at the Vilnius airport in early July, the Lithuanian capital's airport was closed, 
with the majority of flights moved to Kaunas. Ireland's Ryanair was the only airline not to move any flights to 
Kaunas, while other companies didn't move all of their flights.
In July, Vilnius Airport posted a decline in passenger traffic by a factor of 2.8 to 136,200, while passenger numbers 
at Kaunas Airport soared by a factor of 3.4 to 235,800 and those at Palanga Airport surged by 35 percent to 35,900 
passengers. The number of flights fell by a factor of 2.6 in Vilnius to 1,417, surged by a factor of 3.2 in Kaunas to 
2,334 and rose by 17 percent in Palanga to 582.
Over the seven months of 2017, all three airports handed 2.959 million passengers, a rise by 10 percent year-on-
year, while the number of flights went up by 7 percent to 31,900.

No success yet in talks with British Airways, EasyJet, airBaltic - Lithuanian Airports CEO
VILNIUS, Jul 31, BNS – Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of the airports of Vilnius, Kaunas 
and Palanga, has spent the past few years trying to attract a new carrier to fly to one of London's main airports, said 
CEO Gediminas Almantas, noting that there had been no success.
In his words, the Vilnius administration's recent decision to earmark EUR 2.1 million to the efforts to attract the 
carrier to London may be useful, however, it may violate the rules of state support.
Almantas told BNS that conversations with British Airways, EasyJet, Latvia's AirBaltic and others are constantly 
held, however, none of them agreed to work under the market conditions, saying the flights between Vilnius and 
London would not be full due to low demand.
"Business travels require London City, Heathrow and Gatwick airports. These are specific airports. Heathrow is a 
very expensive airport, which is dominated by British Airways. Gatwick is the easiest to access, EasyJet and other 
airlines that probably view our markets more favorably fly there. London City is more of a niche airport," said the 
CEO of Lietuvos Oro Uostai.
The European Union (EU) bans state support of airports or airlines. Without an additional permit form the European 
Commission (EC), only small support of EUR 200,000 can be earmarked within three years, however, the sum is 
too small.
The Vilnius City Council last week decided to earmark about EUR 2.1 million for marketing of flights to one of 
London's main airports. In Almantas' words, handing the money to the airlines is the biggest problem.
British Airways has refused to comment on its plans of new flights to BNS. The company has already flown from 
London to Vilnius, however, closed the route twice, in 2000 and 2006.

Currently, the flights between London and Vilnius, Kaunas and Palanga are conducted by low-cost airlines, 
Hungary's Wizz Air and Ireland's Ryanair.

airBaltic handles 52.6% of passengers at Riga Airport in H1
RIGA, Jul 31, BNS - Latvia’s national carrier airBaltic flew 52.6 percent of the EUR 2.7 million passengers that 
arrived at or departed from Riga International Airport in the first half of 2017, the airport’s representatives told BNS.
Ryanair emerged as the second largest carrier at Riga Airport in the first six months of this year, having flown 16.7 
percent of the airport’s passengers, and Hungarian low-costs airline WizzAir came third with an 8.5 percent market 
share in Riga.
During the first half of this year, Riga Airport welcomed 2.7 million air passengers, or 46 percent of all passengers 
handled by Baltic airports in said period. The airports of all three Baltic capitals together saw the total number of 
passengers grow 11.7 percent to 5.9 million people.
The turnover of passengers at Riga Airport rose by 8.7 percent against the same period a year ago.
Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states. More than 20 airlines operating at Riga 
Airport offer 60 destinations in the winter season and nearly 90 in the summer season.

Vilnius City Council okays bid to earmark EUR 2.1 mln for marketing of flight to London
VILNIUS, Jul 26, BNS – Vilnius City Council has given a green light to the proposal of the ruling parties to earmark 
about 2.1 million euros within the next three years for marketing of flights to one of London's key airports, hoping to 
attract the biggest UK airline, British Airways.
"If we were to name a single point where we're losing – it is direct flights to London, one of the city's three main 
airports. We have clear data from Invest Lithuania about the investments lost within three years and about at least 
four companies," Remigijus Simasius, the Lithuanian capital's mayor, told journalists on Wednesday.
In his words, 2.1 million euros in municipal investments would pay off abundantly in direct benefits only, if at least 
half of potential investors chose Vilnius. The mayor said that the more remote airports of Stansted and Luton, which 
are the destination airports for flights from Vilnius at the moment, do not suit businessmen, therefore, Vilnius wants 
routes to one of the three main airports, namely, London City, Heathrow or Gatwick.
In Simasius' words, if any company takes interest in the direction, the money necessary for marketing will be 
envisaged in the 2018 budget.
Currently, routes to London from Vilnius, Kaunas and Palanga are covered by low-cost airlines, including Hungary's 
Wizz Air and Ireland's Ryanair. Vilnius-London flights by traditional airlines, for instance, British Airways, is a priority 
direction of Lithuanian airports.

Iceland's Primera Air to launch flights from Riga to Malaga next year
RIGA, Jul 5, BNS - The Icelandic airline Primera Air, which moved its headquarters to Latvia in 2014, plans to 
launch flights from Riga to Costa del Sol, Malaga, in Spain, next year, the airline announced.
"The airline's booming growth and air travel tourism trends in the region have encouraged Primera Air to commence 
flights from Riga to its most popular vacation destination - the city of Malaga in Costa del Sol region in the Southern 
Spain. Flights will be carried out once a week throughout the summer season of 2018 using Boeing 737-800 Next-
Gen aircraft with a capacity of 189 passengers. Tickets will be on sale already this August," Primera Air said.
According to Primera Air VP and Chief Commercial Officer Anastasija Visnakova, Malaga has been our most 
popular destination that we have been flying to since founding the airline in 2004. "During our summer season we 
have as many as 17 flights a week from our hubs in Scandinavia and Iceland, with more than 250,000 passengers 
flown to this destination annually. Initially it was a summer-only route, but during the last years Malaga has become 
a year-round destination," she said.
"The last three years have turned out particularly well - Primera Air's key performance indicators have grown 
significantly, it has purchased 20 new aircraft and expanded its business model from charter operations serving 
local flights to new markets with full standard carrier services and is now getting into the transatlantic flight 
segment," Visnakova said.
"Starting flights from Latvia is a crucial step for us, something we have been looking forward to ever since moving 
our headquarters to Latvia. Our cost base allows us to compete with such carriers as Norwegian, Ryanair, Vueling 
and others. We will be able to provide a very competitive product for both individual travelers and travel agencies in 
Latvia," she stated.
The chairperson of Riga International Airport, Ilona Lice, said that the airport was very pleased about Primera Air's 
decision to commence flights from Riga. "Latvia is the carrier's home country and now Riga will be among Primera 
Iceland 's Primera Air to launch flights from Riga to Malaga next year
Air destinations. Their new route to Malaga has been among the most requested direct routes from Riga by our 
passengers, and now they will be able to get to their sunny vacation spot more conveniently. We hope this is just 
the beginning of a fruitful mutual cooperation and Primera Air's growth in Latvia,” she said.
As reported, Primera Air has signed a contract for the purchase and lease of 20 Boeing 737MAX 9 ER airliners.
Primera Air was founded in 2004 in Iceland and initially operated charter flights for Scandinavian tour operators. In 
2014 Primera Air moved their headquarters from Denmark to Latvia and expanded its operations with direct seat 
sales and a push into the low-cost air travel segment. Primera Air flies to more than 70 destinations using eight 
Boeing Next Generation aircraft. Primera Air is part of Primera Travel Group, which includes the leading travel 
agencies in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland

2 flights interrupted by bomb hoax at Kaunas airport
VILNIUS, Jan 06, BNS – Two flights were interrupted at the Kaunas Airport in Lithuania by an anonymous bomb 
hoax on Tuesday.
After checking the airport's terminal, the authorities called off the Plan Shield at 1:30 p.m. (local time) and listed the 
threat as a hoax, said Lietuvos Oro Uostai (Lithuanian Airports), the operator of the airports of Vilnius, Kaunas and 
Palanga.
The hoax interrupted two scheduled flights – to and from Edinburgh and Luton, London. A Ryanair flight from 
Edinburgh landed at 11:25 a.m. as planned and was parked at the biggest possible distance from the airport. 
Passengers were provided with water.
The airplane was planned to take off at 11:55 a.m., with the flight to proceed shortly.
A Wizzair flight from Luton, which was scheduled to land at 12:30 p.m., was diverted to Vilnius and landed at 12:06 
p.m. The flight to London on the flight has been canceled, consequently, passengers had to discuss ticket change 
or return with the airline.
The anonymous call about an explosive device planted at Kaunas Airport on Tuesday was received at the 
Emergency Response Center at 10:34 a.m., causing evacuation about 250 passengers and terminal employees. 
Mine neutralization specialists of the Aras unit arrived at 12:38 p.m. to scrutinize the terminal.
The police of Lithuania's second-largest city Kaunas opened a probe into the hoax, which carries a sentence of up 
to four years in prison.

Negotiations with Ryanair on opening hub in Riga continue – airport CEO
RIGA, May 25, BNS - Riga International Airport continues negotiations with Irish low-cost airline Ryanair on opening 
a hub in Riga, said the airport’s board chairwoman Ilona Lice in an interview with the Latvian public radio on 
Thursday.
"We continue talks on Ryanair hub," said Lice.
Asked whether the Irish airline wants to negotiate better terms than other airlines, Lice was evasive, just said that 
the new agreement between Riga International Airport and Irish Ryanair on ground handling services was signed 
two years ago, and the historical mistakes have been corrected.
"It is a good commercial agreement on good terms. (...) We will see – negotiations are rather hopeful. We are not a 
low-cost airport any more, however," said Lice.
Fully-owned by the Latvian state, Riga International Airport is the largest air traffic hub in the Baltic states.

Ryanair growth should bring more aircraft repairs bases to Lithuania- transpmin
VILNIUS, Mar 27, BNS – Ireland's low-cost airline Ryanair intends to expand its aircraft repairs and technical 
maintenance base in Kaunas and hire 50 more employees, therefore, Lithuania's Transport and Communications 
Minister Rokas Masiulis expressed hope for other airlines to develop their aircraft maintenance business in 
Lithuania.
"We believe others will come to Lithuania, if we manage to meet the Ryanair expectations," the minister told BNS.
Mick Hickeys, chief of operations at Ryanair, last week discussed the company's development plans at a meeting 
with Masiulis in Kaunas. Ryanair said the planned expansion would allow raising the staff from the current 200 to 
250.
In Masiulis' words, Ryanair's long-term plans include increasing the headcount to about 500. However, to achieve 
this, Lithuania must prove availability of the necessary infrastructure and a sufficient number of engineers.
"We eagerly listened to their expansion plans and will do our best to do everything to make sure they choose 
Kaunas over everyone else. For this purpose, we will consolidate the Civil Aviation Administration to meet their 
expectations. It must be faster at certifying engineers and mechanics working on aircraft. We have also agreed with 
the education and science minister that the ministry should provide all possibilities for aviation mechanics to study 
and acquire the qualifications, as Ryanair alone may need between 300 and 500 of such specialists," Masiulis told 
BNS.
Ryanair has ordered 380 new Boeing airplanes, which should expand the airline's fleet to 600 by 2024. Ryanair 
intends to create a total of 1,000 jobs in its maintenance bases across Europe.

Riga Airport has to consolidate its positions as the leading Baltic airport - Augulis
RIGA, Feb 9, BNS - During a meeting with the Riga International Airport's CEO Ilona Lice today, Transport Minister 
Uldis Augulis (Greens/Farmers) emphasized the importance of consolidating Riga Airport's positions as the leading 
airport in the Baltics.
In turn, Lice informed Augulis about the airport's performance and tasks for 2017, as the Transport Ministry told 
BNS.
"The current growth figures show that the airport has been consistently implementing its business strategy, and the 
strategy has proved successful. Investments in the development of the company have helped attain this - the 
airport's infrastructure has been modernized, passenger terminal expanded, the airport's competitiveness has 
improved and favorable business environment has been created for airlines, including for the development of the 
strategically-important long-haul flights. But we must not stop at this point, active work has to continue for Riga 
Airport to become the key transit hub in aviation, as competition in the aviation industry continues to increase," said 
Augulis.
The Riga Airport at the moment accounts for 45 percent of total passenger turnover in the Baltic countries, 43 
percent of all flights in the Baltics, and 44 percent of air cargo turnover, said Lice. Riga Airport had record 
passenger turnover in 2016, and expects that passenger numbers will continue to rise this year, she added.
In the meantime, the airport's infrastructure development continues. The main infrastructure development project 
implemented in 2016 was the new Northern Terminal, but there also were other important projects carried out last 
year, including reconstruction of the airport's taxiways, fencing, the airport's warehousing complex, and others.
Riga Airport has to consolidate its positions as the leading Baltic airport - Augulis
Substantial investments in the airport's infrastructure development are also planned for this and coming years, said 
Lice. One of the priorities is cargo handling infrastructure upgrades in order to increase cargo turnover.
According to the Transport Ministry, the following infrastructure development projects are planned for this year, 
including with the European Union's co-financing: construction of a helipad, taxiway lighting improvements, surface 
runoff drainage system reconstruction, and reducing CO2 emissions in the airport territory.
Furthermore, the airport will closely cooperate with Eiropas Dzelzcela Linijas company in designing Rail Baltica train 
station at the Riga Airport, said Lice, and work on expansion of the airport's passenger terminals will continue.
Last year, the airport served 5.4 million passengers, which is almost 5 percent more than in 2015. More than 50 
percent of the airport's passengers fly national airline airBaltic, 18.3 percent - Ryanair, and 8.5 percent - WizAir.
