Irish ultra-low-cost carrier Ryanair has been ordered to pay (EURO)10,000 ($10,800) to a schoolboy who suffered a 
"terrifying ordeal" onboard a flight in 2018.
Stefan Kokic, now aged 17 (but aged 11 during the incident), was on a Ryanair flight in 2018 from Dublin Airport 
(DUB) to Croatia's Zadar Airport (ZAD) when the aircraft had to make an emergency landing into Frankfurt-Hahn 
Airport (HHN) after the cabin experienced loss of pressure.
According to the Irish Examiner, Barrister Ciaran Mandal told Judge John O'Connor in the Circuit Civil Court on July 
3, 2023 that Kokic underwent a "terrifying ordeal" because of the incident.
"Stefan was involved in an undoubtedly terrifying ordeal," Mandal said.
The 17-year-old had sued Ryanair through his mother, Nikolina Kokic who said in an affidavit that her son had 
suffered emotional upset as a result of the accident but had dealt well with the experience.
Following the incident, Stefan visited his physician twice, and was diagnosed with a degree of stress secondary to 
the incident as well as headaches.
The claim was brought under the Montreal Convention which states the event that occurred had to be an accident 
and the complainant had to have suffered bodily injury in order to recover damages.
Mandal said the airline had belatedly conceded the event was an accident.
On July 3, 2023, Judge John O'Connor in the Circuit Civil Court ordered Ryanair to issue a (EURO)10,000 
settlement offer on the basis of "outstanding issues".

Qatar Airways Group announced record annual revenue for the fiscal year 2022/23, attributing its financial success 
to the FIFA World Cup hosted in Qatar. The airline reported a 100% increase in passenger revenue, resulting in 
overall revenue of 76.3 billion Qatari riyals ($21 billion).
In the past year, Qatar Airways saw a significant increase in the number of passengers, with 31.7 million 
passengers flying with the carrier, marking a 71% rise compared to the previous year. The FIFA World Cup played 
a substantial role in this increase, with the airline transporting 1.4 million passengers to the tournament as the 
official airline.
Qatar Airways credited its financial achievements to a "successful strategy during an extraordinary year." This 
aligns with the broader global trend of airlines experiencing a resurgence as the travel industry recovers from the 
pandemic. In recent months, various airlines, including Emirates and Ryanair, have reported substantial profits.
Despite facing competition from new rivals like Riyadh Air, which launched in March, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al 
Baker expressed confidence in his airline's ability to compete effectively in the market.
Investors will be closely monitoring Qatar Airways' performance in the coming year, as the airline continues to adapt 
to evolving market dynamics and competition while maintaining its strong position.

Jul 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, JetBlue Airways JBLU[1] management announced that it has commenced operating non-stop 
daily flights to Paris from New York's John F. Kennedy International or JFK Airport. 
Delta Air Lines DAL[2] was also in the news, courtesy of its deal with El Al Israel Airlines in an attempt to boost 
connectivity between the United States and Israel. European carrier, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[3] grabbed 
headlines by virtue of its stellar traffic numbers for the month of June despite multiple flight cancellations. Recap of 
the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. DAL's agreement with El Al Israel Airlines involves reciprocal codeshare 
and frequent flyer benefits, allowing passengers to earn and redeem miles on both carriers. Initially, customers will 
be able to check in for their entire journey and have their boarding passes issued and bags checked through to their 
destination. We believe that the decision to ink a deal with El Al is a prudent move by Delta's management. By 
expanding its network and improving connectivity, this Atlanta-based carrier can attract more customers and 
generate additional revenues. The ability to earn and redeem miles on both carriers will also appeal to frequent 
flyers, potentially increasing customer loyalty[4]. Delta currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[5]. 
Delta was also in the news recently courtesy of its bullish guidance for the second quarter of 2023, owing to the 
highly impressive air travel demand scenario. That news was covered in detail in the previous week[6]'s writeup. 
2. The launch of flights to Paris marks JetBlue's expansion into continental Europe, filling a gap in its network and 
meeting the demands of its customer base. With daily flights connecting New York to Paris, the success of its 
London service and upcoming routes to Amsterdam, JetBlue is disrupting the dominance of high-fare legacy 
carriers in the transatlantic market. The airline's decision to expand its presence in the transatlantic market is a 
prudent one given the upbeat air travel demand scenario. The routes should generate significant traffic, in turn 
boosting[7] JetBlue's top line. 
3. Despite having to cancel over 900 flights in June due to air traffic control strikes, Ryanair carried the maximum 
passengers ever in a month. The low-cost carrier transported 17.4 million passengers, compared with 15.9 million 
in June 2022. Load factor (% of seats filled with passengers) was an impressive 95% for the month.

4. According to a Reuters report[8], JetBlue Airways' management has decided not to appeal against the federal 
judge's ruling in May to terminate the alliance with American Airlines AAL[9] in the Northeast as it was anti-
competitive. JetBlue's management, however, strongly disagrees with the court ruling. Despite that, JBLU will not 
appeal against the decision to save its impending $3.8 billion buyout of Spirit Airlines SAVE[10]. Performance The 
following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six 
months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index gaining 2.1% to $79.14. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
appreciated 41.3%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Delta is scheduled to kickstart the second-quarter earnings 
season for airlines on Jul 13. Investors will keenly await DAL's performance amid this bullish air-travel demand 
scenario.

Jul 06, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Werner Enterprises, Inc. WERN[1] is benefiting from its shareholder-friendly initiatives. The company's efforts to 
boost its shareholder value via dividend payouts and share repurchases are commendable. 
WERN has a consistent record of paying out dividends since 1987. The latest dividend hike was in May 2023, when 
it raised the quarterly dividend by 7.7% to 14 cents per share (56 cents annually). 
WERN has been consistently making efforts to reward its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, 
which are encouraging. In May 2022, WERN announced an 8.3% hike in the dividend to 13 cents per share 
(annualized 52 cents). 
In first-quarter 2023, Werner paid out $8.22 million in dividends but did not repurchase any shares. As of Mar 31, 
2023, WERN had 2.3 million shares remaining under its share repurchase authorization. In 2022, Werner paid out 
$32.2 million in dividends and repurchased shares worth $110.40 million. In 2021, Werner paid out $29.08 million in 
dividends and repurchased shares worth $104.44 million. 
We believe that such shareholder-friendly initiatives boost investors' confidence and positively impact the stock's 
bottom line. So far this past year, shares of Werner have gained 8% compared with the 21.3% rise of the industry[2] 
it belongs to. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
On the flip side, rising operating expenses pose a threat to Werner's bottom line. The company's total operating 
expenses rose 14.4% to $779.3 million in the March-end quarter. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair currently carries 
a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Copa Holdings CPA[4] 
and CSX Corporation CSX[5]. Copa Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and CSX carries a Zacks Rank 
#2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Copa Holdings has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.42% for the current year. CPA delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 14.60%, on average. 
Werner (WERN) Rides on Dividends & Buybacks Despite Expenses
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CPA's current-year earnings has improved 25.5% over the past 90 days. 
Shares of CPA have soared 32.5% over the past six months. 
CSX has an expected earnings growth rate of 2.09% for the current year. CSX delivered a trailing four-quarter 
earnings surprise of 7.76%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSX's current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the past 90 days. Shares 
of CSX have risen 6.6% over the past six months.

Passengers were forced into action aboard a Ryanair flight from Croatia to London when a man stormed the plane's 
exit door and tried to get out shortly before takeoff.
In a video posted to the popular social media platform TikTok, the passenger can be seen heading for the exit while 
shouting "open the door."
That's when several other passengers stepped in, tackling the man to the ground before he was ultimately taken 
into custody by local police.
The flight was returning from Zadar on Friday following the Hideout music festival on the island of Pag.
"This flight from Zadar to London Stansted returned to stand after an individual passenger became disruptive while 
preparing for take-off. The passenger was removed from the aircraft by local police before this flight continued 
safely to London Stansted," a Ryanair spokesperson told The Independent.
"This is now a matter for local police. We sincerely apologize to affected passengers for any inconvenience caused 
as a result of this passenger's disruptive behavior."
The man is currently in custody on suspicion of assaulting an officer.

AROUND 160,000 Ryanair passengers saw flights cancelled as a result of air traffic control strikes in France last 
month, the carrier said yesterday.
Controllers across the country have been protesting the hike in the pension age from 62 to 64.
Due to French law, international overflights cannot use the country's airspace - forcing airlines to cancel scheduled 
journeys rather than attempt to go around the country.
The former BA boss and now the head of the global airlines body IATA, Willie Walsh, has called for a change in the 
law to allow business as usual during strikes.
Controllers have been engaged in industrial action for more than 60 days this year.
Ryanair carried 17.4m passengers in June, operating 96,250 flights, with the former up some 9 per cent year on 
year.

Peel Hunt analysts have rated budget carrier Ryanair as a 'buy'. The Ireland-based airline landed a record number 
of flights in June - over 96,000 - and reported a nine per cent increase in passenger volumes from the previous 
year. More pesky strikes led to the cancellation of over 900 flights but analysts said the "strength of demand" for the

Jul 05, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair HoldingsRYAAY[1] benefits from improved traffic growth, which implies increased passenger volume. 
Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic from the 
pandemic lows. Ryanair has raised its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 185 million (prior view: 168 million). Ryanair's 
fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$1,908.7 million and improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair recently reported highly impressive traffic numbers for June 2023, driven by upbeat air-travel 
demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in June was 17.4 million. This compared favorably 
with the May 2023 figure of 17 million and 15.9 million in June 2022. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor 
(percentage of seats filled by passengers) was high at 95% in June 2023. The reading was similar a year ago. 
RYAAY operated more than 96,250 flights in June 2023. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in air-travel demand are encouraging. RYAAY's 
total fleet included 537 aircraft as of Mar 31, 2023. 
Due to buoyant air-travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 48.5% so far this year compared with 37.1% 
growth of the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
On the flip side, more than 900 flights (almost 160,000 guests) were canceled due to air traffic controllers strikes in 
June 2023. 
Rising fuel prices pose a threat to Ryanair's bottom line. The airline's fuel costs increased 113% in fiscal 2023. 
Apart from higher fuel prices, the ramp-up in the airline's operations is pushing up total costs. Operating costs were 
up 75% in fiscal 2023. Zacks Rank & Key Picks Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation[3] sector are Copa Holdings CPA[4] 
and CSX Corporation CSX[5]. Copa Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while CSX carries a Zacks 
Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[6]. 
Copa Holdings has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.42% for the current year. CPA delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 14.60%, on average.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) achieved a record month for traffic in June, logging 17.4mln passengers with a 
load factor of 95%.
This represents a 9% year-on-year increase against the 15.9mln passengers logged in June 2022.
It was also the second record-setting month in a row, following May's 17mln total passenger count.
On a rolling 12-month basis, Ryanair has carried 173.4mln passengers to their destinations with a 94% load factor, 
compared to 134.5mln passengers with an 86% load factor this time last year.
Will July see another record? - Source: investor.ryanair.com
Ryanair operated over 96,250 flights in June 2023 with over 900 cancellations impacting around 160,000 
passengers, which the Irish carrier said was mainly due to air traffic control strikes in France.
Per French law, international flights are prohibited from crossing French airspace during an ATC strike, even though 
domestic flights must keep running.
Other European budget carriers have also enjoyed an impressive post-Covid resurgence.
Hungarian rival Wizz Air carried 5.3mln passengers in June, marking a 22.5% year-on-year increase.
WizzAir's load factor underperformed against Ryanair at 92.2%

(ANSA) - JUL 4 - Benedetto Mineo, the head of Italy's price-monitoring watchdog, on Tuesday asked air lines 
running services on domestic routes for "precise explanations on the dynamics of prices" particularly in relation to 
"routes that have seen an anomalous variation" in prices, according to a statement from the business and Made in 
Italy ministry. The request comes after national statistics agency Istat registered a 40% annual increase in average 
ticket prices in May. 
The explanations "must be provided within 10 days", ahead of the meeting of the new price alert commission on 
July 20. The ministry is probing the trend in ticket prices on some routes connecting the cities of Rome and Milan 
with Venice, Palermo, Catania and Cagliari in particular. On Tuesday Mineo met with Ita Airways, Ryanair, Malta 
Air, Aeroitalia, Easyjet, Neos and Wizz Air. On Saturday Consumer association Codacons, which recently got the 
Antitrust authority to open a probe into the price of flights between the mainland and Sicily, said it welcomed news 
of the meeting. "The government is right to summon the airlines to verify what is happening with flight prices," said 
Codacons President Carlo Rienzi. "We have been saying for months that the air-sector prices are out of control. 
"We consider the price trends in the air-transport sector to be absolutely unjustified and they are a huge damage to 
citizens, especially in the period of the summer departures," he added.

and by 2.4% from 17.0 million in May. Load factor was 95%, unchanged from June 2022 but up slightly from 94% in 
May.
Ryanair noted that 900 flights were cancelled last month due to air traffic controller strikes, affecting about 160,000 
passengers.
On a rolling 12-month basis to June, Ryanair said it carried 173.4 million passengers with a 94% load factor, up 
from 134.5 million with a 86% load factor the year before.

Wizz Air said it took delivery last month of its latest A321neo aircraft from Airbus SE. It said that it plans to have its 
entire fleet at London Luton Airport made up of A321neo planes by 2025, as part of its effort to reduce carbon 
emissions.
Wizz Air shares were up 0.3% at 2,782.00 pence in London early Tuesday. Ryanair shares were up 1.2% at 
EUR17.50 in Frankfurt.

July 4th, 2023 ( The Week UK  — Delivered by  Newstex )
There has been a surge in holiday bookings from the UK to Europe and the US this summer, but prices are on the 
rise.
SEE MORE Travel bucket list: 60 best holiday ideas and destinations
SEE MORE Best suitcases and smart luggage for travel in 2023
Flight prices in Europe 'soared' at nearly 'six times the rate of inflation', said the Daily Mirror , while holiday operator 
TUI declared that the 'era of ultra-cheap flights' is 'over', The Times  reported.
There isn't much holiday makers can do about the ticket fee, but they can save on the extras by booking well in 
advance to obtain the cheapest seats and minimising on luggage.
Packing light is really the key, especially since some carriers are charging extra for overhead hand luggage. Here 
we pick out some of the best packing hacks that could make a huge difference to your airfare - and allow you to 
take just what you need while you are away.
Watch the weights
Different airlines can have very different policies when it comes to hand luggage, which is important to know if you 
are planning to move around, or if you've booked different carriers to and from your destination. For example, 
Vueling permits hand luggage to be 10kg while ITA Airways only allows passengers to carry 8kg onboard.
Bag sizes also vary. Ryanair's baggage policy cites that a carry-on included in the ticket price must be no heavier 
than 10kg and no larger than 40cm x 20cm x 25cm, while easyJet's 'free' cabin bag can have a maximum size of 
45cm x 36cm x 20cm (including any handles and wheels) with a maximum weight of 15kg.
Fold like a pro
How to pack efficiently and save on airfares
Strange as it may sound, 'pack hacks' are almost as popular as ASMR videos on social media, with many dedicated 
to maximising on suitcase space. Guildford-based Sophie Liard, aka @thefoldinglady , has an incredible 4.4 million 
followers and 50.1 million likes on TikTok. One of her latest 'pack with me' videos , has more than 63,000 views. 
Lennia McCarter, aka @LenniaMC  the 'folding queen', is fashion's answer to an origami expert. Her puffer jacket 
folding tutorial has more than 200,000 likes on TikTok .
For those who know their capsule wardrobe there's @makelifesimpler  on Instagram whose most popular video 
demonstrates how to fold three jumpers, two pairs of jeans and various underwear pieces into a puffer jacket, to 
form a neat parcel.
Essential accessories
Packing cubes are the secret to a 'shrinkable' wardrobe. Pack Hacker , which specialises in 'one bag urban travel', 
has dozens of reviews of meshy marvels that keep clothes neatly compressed and organised. Popular brands 
include Muji, Patagonia and Carl Friedrik, which has a set made from recycled materials (75 for four). Packing 
cubes fit inside suitcases like 'pieces of a puzzle', said The Telegraph , and save space while travelling.
Compact style-setting
Fashion's late 'king of pleats', Issey Miyake, pioneered chic, crease-free clothes with his enduringly range of 
accordion effect fabrics that bounce back into shape even when crumpled. His 'Pleats Please' range for women and 
'Homme Pliss' range are available from matchesfashion.com , although similar fabrics can regularly be found on 
rails in high street stores. Most stretch wear also lends itself well to scrunching. French brand Marcia  makes sexy 
stretch shirts, cut-out dresses and tops out of ECONYL, a recycled nylon fabric that is super lightweight and soft 
against the skin.
Nike 's Forward hoodie (124.95) is made of an ultra lightweight material that's needle-punched as opposed to spun, 
knitted, cut and sewn. This means it's more sustainably made than the brand's traditional knit fleeces with raw 
pockets and seams to boot, which also saves on manufacturing processes and valuable packing space.
For warmth, Uniqlo 's ultra light down zip-up gilets (40) can be easily flattened and rolled. While Rains ' Liner W 
Vest (105) has a cooler, boxier cut, and comes with a two-year warranty. Le Monde Beryl , a London-based label 
that makes dainty and lightweight Venetian style mules and slippers, is the go-to for peripatetic fashion editors. Elle 
Dcor  journalist Sean Santiago said they are an essential part of his moveable 'micro closet'.
Longchamp
Lightweight luggage
With so many weight and size restrictions, carry-ons  are big business. British brand Aerolite , for example, makes 
cabin bags for individual airlines. For a short stay, Longchamp 's foldable and chic Le Pliage Original S travel bag is 
the perfect size to match easyJet's aforementioned carry-on dimensions.
Australian brand July has recently launched in the UK and is well known for its streamlined cases, all expertly 
designed to be as lightweight and spacious as possible. July's Carry On Light is the lightest double-wheel suitcase 
in the world, at just 1.8kg with 32 litres of space. Italso comes in an expandable version  - at just 2.2kg, you can 
unzip it to expand the suitcase from 35litres to 40 litres - the perfect carry-on for minimalistic travellers in need of 
extra space.

Jul 04, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Airline stocks have been flying high, primarily owing to the uptick in passenger volumes. Air travel demand has 
bounced back very strongly from the pandemic lows and is particularly strong on the leisure front. What is more 
encouraging is that international demand is also bouncing back nicely. 
The decline in expenses on fuel represents another tailwind for the industry. Notably, oil price declined roughly 12% 
in the first six months of 2023. This bodes well for the bottom-line growth of industry participants. This is because 
fuel expenses are a significant input cost for the aviation space. 
Driven by these positives, the Zacks Airline [1]industry surged 36% in the first six months of 2023 despite economic 
uncertainties, way ahead of the S&P 500's 16.9% rise in the same time period. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
We expect industry participants to continue their good performance in the second half of the year. Given the 
positivity surrounding the industry, we believe that betting on airline stocks like Copa Holdings CPA[2], Allegiant 
Travel Company ALGT[3] and Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] is a prudent move. Airlines Likely to Continue Flying 
High in 2H: Here's Why Multiple flight cancellations and delays due to unfavorable weather conditions have not 
been able to dampen the demand for travel. Per data provided by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), 
nearly 2.9 million[5] people moved through checkpoints across the United States on Jun 30, which is higher than 
the corresponding 2019 (pre-coronavirus) levels. TSA expects passenger volumes to hit a record in the 
Independence Day holiday period, with 17.7 million people likely to be screened in the Jun 29-Jul 5 time frame. 
With passenger volumes anticipated to remain high throughout the year, air travel is expected to soar over the 
Labor Day holiday period later this year as well. It is also anticipated to be high during winter, thereby keeping 
airlines in good shape. 
This optimism regarding air travel is not limited to the United States only. In June, the International Air Transport 
Association or IATA doubled [6]its current-year profitability (net) forecast for the industry to $9.8 billion from $4.7 
billion. Passenger revenues are the biggest driver of this rosy projection. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 are 
now anticipated to be $546 billion compared with the previous estimate of $522 billion. The revised revenue 
forecast indicates a 27% increase from the 2022 actuals. 
3 Airline Stocks That Appear to be Solid Bets for 2H23
The anticipated decline in oil price is corroborated by the fact that average jet fuel cost is expected to be $98.5 per 
barrel in 2023 per IATA, much lower than the earlier forecast of $111.9 per barrel. 
Given the encouraging projections, we have picked three airline stocks, which investors can bet on. These stocks 
carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) presently and have a VGM Score[7] of A. Moreover, the companies 
have witnessed favorable earnings estimate revisions for the current year. Our research shows that stocks with a 
VGM Score of A, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors. 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[8]. Price Performance: 1H23 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Our Choices Copa Holdings, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1, is 
benefiting from an improvement in air travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, passenger revenues increased 28.5% 
from first-quarter 2019 levels due to higher yields. 
Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus 
Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 25.1% upward over the past 60 days. 
Allegiant is seeing a steady recovery in leisure air travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, this Las Vegas, NV-based 
company's operating revenues grew 29.9% on a year-over-year basis. Passenger revenues, accounting for 93.7% 
of the top line, increased 31.3% on a year-over-year basis. 
Allegiant's fleet modernization efforts are encouraging. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALGT's current-year 
earnings has been revised 41% upward in the past 60 days. ALGT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. 
Ryanair Holdings is based in Ireland. Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months 
owing to the rebound in air traffic from COVID-19 lows. The latest upbeat traffic result came in June when the low-
cost carrier transported 17.4 million passengers, compared with 15.9 million in Jun 2022. Load factor (% of seats 
filled with passengers) was an impressive 95% for the month. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in travel demand are also very encouraging. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for RYAAY's current-year earnings has been revised 7.4% upward in the past 60 days. 
RYAAY currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

 While "the trend is your friend" when it comes to short-term investing or trading, timing entries into the trend is a 
key determinant of success. And increasing the odds of success by making sure the sustainability of a trend isn't 
easy. 
The trend often reverses before exiting the trade, leading to a short-term capital loss for investors. So, for a 
profitable trade, one should confirm factors such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. 
that could keep the momentum in the stock alive. 
Our "Recent Price Strength" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful 
in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental 
strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper 
portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness. 
There are several stocks that passed through the screen and Ryanair (RYAAY) is one of them. Here are the key 
reasons why this stock is a solid choice for "trend" investing. 
A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the 
potential upside in a stock. RYAAY is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 18.1% over this period. 
However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal 
that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A 
price increase of 4% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this airline. 
Moreover, RYAAY is currently trading at 98.6% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge 
of a breakout. 
Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of 
more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the 
key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements. 
The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into 
five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive 
externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 
1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here  > > > >[1] 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Is a Great Choice for 'Trend' Investors, Here's Why
Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 
(Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price 
performance. 
So, the price trend in RYAAY may not reverse anytime soon. 
In addition to RYAAY, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our "Recent Price Strength" 
screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria. 
This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing 
style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens[2] that are strategically created to beat the market. 
However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable 
results in the past. You could easily do that with the help of the Zacks Research Wizard. In addition to allowing you 
to backtest the effectiveness of your strategy, the program comes loaded with some of our most successful stock-

European Commission positive SAS aid package will stand
European Commission positive SAS aid package will stand

Jul 04, 2023( AirInsight: http://airinsight.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 TheEuropean Commission[1] (EC) has launched an in-depth investigation into the recapitalization of Scandinavian 
airlineSAS[2] during the Covid crisis in 2020. Brussels has no other option but to review the SEK 11 billion state aid 
package after the European Court of Justice annulled the original approval in May. However, the commission is 
positive that the aid package conforms with EU regulations. 
After the first Covid wave in early 2020, SAS immediately launched a restructuring to reduce costs by laying off 
4.000 staff, outsourcing some ground operations, and renegotiating contracts. This would eventually lead to theSAS 
FORWARD[3] transformation plan in February 2022, which SAS hopes to successfully complete after exiting 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection[4]later this year. 
But in 2020, the Swedish and Danish governments as stakeholders of SAS offered SEK 11 billion ($1.0 billion) as 
part of the recapitalization plan[5]. This included SEK 2.0 billion in equity participation through new shares, a rights 
issue of SEK 3.0 billion through the subscription and underwriting of new shares, and SEK 6.0 billion in state hybrid 
notes. The Danish government would participate with SEK 3.5 billion and the Swedish government with SEK 2.5 
billion. 
The two countries notified the European Commission of the package on August 11, 2020. Within a week, on August 
17, the EC approved the state aid under the terms and conditions of the Covid Temporary Framework Plan (TFEU). 
Complaint from Ryanair 
In a complaint submitted to the European General Court of Justice in Luxemburg, Ryanair stated that the aid to both 
SAS and Lufthansa Group was illegal and discriminatory. As reported[6], the Court largely agreed with Ryanair on 
May 10, which means it annulled the approval for the June and August 2020 state aid packages to Lufthansa and 
SAS. 
In the case of Lufthansa, the General Court considered that the EC had based its approval on incomplete and 
wrong considerations. In the SAS ruling, it said that the recapitalization measure granted to SAS did not meet one 
of the conditions set out in the Covid Temporary Framework.  
'In particular, it ruled that the Commission failed to require the inclusion of a step-up mechanism (or an alternative 
mechanism with the same effect as a step-up mechanism) to ensure that Denmark and Sweden would receive a 
European Commission positive SAS aid package will stand
sufficient remuneration for their investment and that SAS would have incentives to buy back the shares acquired by 
Denmark and Sweden as soon as possible,' the Commission said today in a media statement. 
Vestager is confident 
The EC will now have to review its decisions on Lufthansa and SAS, which is expected to take months to reach a 
final decision. While this includes an in-depth investigation, the Commission is confident that the recapitalization aid 
has been justified after all. In the press statement, Executive Vice President for Competition, Margrethe Verstager, 
says: 
'Today's opening decision confirms, on a preliminary basis, that the recapitalization measure is largely in line with 
the conditions set out in the COVID Temporary Framework. The opening addresses the General Court's judgment 
on the absence of a step-up mechanism. If this aspect satisfactorily is addressed, the concerns as expressed by the 
General Court would be resolved. On process, it should be possible to conclude the analysis by the end of the 
year.' 
The Commission notes that the opening of the investigation gives Denmark and Sweden and third parties the 
opportunity to submit comments. 'It does not prejudge in any way the outcome of the investigation.' 
In response to the decision of the Commission, SAS says that it 'welcomes the EU Commission's decision to open 
a formal investigation following the General Court's ruling on 10 May 2023. It is important to reach a robust solution 
to the issue identified by the General Court as quickly as possible.SAS will continue to assist the states of Sweden 
and Denmark as well as the EU Commission in this process.' 
Equity procedure 
Meanwhile, SAS is currently in an advanced stage of its equity solicitation procedure[7] that was launched in May. 
The airline wants to secure some SEK 9.0 billion in fresh equity to restructure debts. SAS said last month that it has 
seen 'substantial interest from potential financial and strategic investors to participate in the process.'  
With final bids now expected four weeks later until September 18, SAS said it hopes to complete the Chapter 11 
procedure a little later now by year-end.

Airport, with a stellar developing trend experienced between the first and second quarters
"It's very exciting and quite extraordinary", commented David Surley - senior director responsible for air traffic 
development and marketing at Aarhus Airport, "we anticipated year-on-year growth to evolve this summer, but the 
peak summer travel period is only now commencing and we have already broken all previous records on monthly, 
quarterly and half-year passenger numbers to-date in 2023. Our teams are working hard to delight guests in our 
fantastic new terminal, we have been recruiting, training, refining and scaling-up for the busiest period in the 
airport's history with stronger-than-ever customer demand".
The first six months of the year have flown by at high altitude, firmly setting a national benchmark again as 
Denmark's fastest growing international airport, not only growing explosively, but similarly clearing all previous 
records off the table. To-date, for the first half of 2023 the airport secured a +47% year-on year total traffic growth 
while within that, international traffic climbed by an extraordinary +63%, representing an +18.5% increase compared 
to 2019. In the month of June alone, the passenger numbers for travelers to/from international destinations 
recorded an increase of +61% compared to 2022 and +43% versus June 2019. The combined monthly total 
increased +43% year-on-year versus 2022 and +15% versus 2019.
"The number of both leisure and business travelers using the airport is increasing strongly and this is fully in line 
with our ambition to accelerate overall connectivity in and out of the Greater Aarhus metropolitan area, reflective of 
Aarhus being mainland Denmark's largest growth pole and greatly in need of better and better worldwide reach. 
Delivering capacity for this combined demand is our purpose", says Lotta Sandsgaard, CEO of Aarhus Airport, "as 
gateway to the Nordic region's fifth largest population catchment of over 1.4 million and growing in the Greater 
Aarhus metropolitan area."
Among recent developments Aarhus Airport has welcomed new routes with Ryanair to Faro and Palma de 
Mallorca. Sunclass Airlines (in-house carrier of tour operator Spies) also started Mallorca and opens Las Palmas 
Gran Canaria from the autumn, operated by BRA - Braathens International Airways, while the Swedish airline itself 
began its own service to Visby on Gotland island today - the first such service from Denmark. Added capacity on 
well-established markets like London and Gdansk has also arrived this summer due and Naples will be a new 
Aarhus Airport Sets Impressive First-Half Performance at Mid-Point of 2023
seasonal destination this autumn. SAS is set to expand service to its Oslo hub next month and vacation spots 
including Sharm el Sheikh, Hurghada and Cyprus also see greater seat capacity ahead.
"The summer's sunshine routes are busy from the word 'go', there is a visible vacation get-away vibe in the terminal 
and rumours of slower than normal demand for the Mediterranean at other Danish airports are simply not the case 
here in Aarhus", added the airport's David Surley. "By contrast, here we have seen a stellar increase in sunshine 
travel depsite the pleasant May and June weather. We can also see a very sharp turn-around in historic leakage 
and strong take-up of our newly opened routes. An absolute u-turn in customer behaviour is happening, we can see 
where many have driven on average around 4-hours to reach other airports in the past, even to Germany, instead 
they are now enjoying just a short trip to the airport and easy flights direct from their doorstep".
Traffic growth both to as well as from Aarhus forms part of the rocket-like upward curve for half-year passenger 
numbers. A fast-developing trend on international flight services has seen the quarterly passenger volume rise from 
a state of level post-pandemic traffic recovery and status quo versus 2019 in quarter one, to a situation of explosive 
monthly traffic growth during quarter two, now standing at +59% trend year-on-year for the 2nd quarter and +39% 
versus pre-pandemic Q2 2019.
"Aarhus Airport is the gateway for Denmark's second city and our excellent mid-year traffic figures reflect the high 
convenience and take-up rate of being located amid a major metropolitan area on-the-rise. The city of Aarhus is 
increasingly developing its position as a strong destination, for business tourism too, recently ranked well within the 
top 100 of the world's most popular conference locations", says the airport's CEO.
David Surley further echoed this, adding, "the city remains in high growth, the region-wide economy is buoyant and 
a sharp development in related hotel capacity is on the way. We've even opened our own in-terminal hotel in recent 
months and looking ahead with stakeholders, we anticipate increasing demand from all angles - from shipping and 
cruise lines, to conferences, academic and group travel as well, with almost all market opportunities back in growth. 
Points both closer-to-home and further afield are targeted for service - to south and central Europe, also Türkiye, 
North America and more distant hubs, where Aarhus is the largest metropolitan market by far in Nordic Europe yet 
to be connected.
Aarhus Airport and VisitAarhus will welcome delegates of Routes Europe to Aarhus in April 2024 when the city 
hosts the international airline network community for the European event's very first time in Denmark.

Orix Aviation has found a new customer for aircraft retrieved from the Norwegian Flyr insolvency.
Airfinance Journal has been told that the Japanese bank-backed firm is transitioning an additional, 2011-vintage 
Boeing 737-800 to Air Europa from Spain.
Last month AFJ broke the news that Orix Aviation had placed its first aircraft, a 737-800, with new customer Air 
Europa Express. That unit came off lease with Ryanair.
Just like the previous delivery, Airfinance Journal Fleet Tracker data indicates that the next 737 in line for Air 
Europa is also managed by Orix on behalf of Japanese operating lease investors.
In April, AFJ reported that Air Europa Express had accepted another 2013-vintage 737-800 from Aergo Capital.
Mainline Air Europa now has 18 737-800s in service. All of them are leased from lessors including Chishima, Aer 
Dragon, Goal, Apollo, JP Lease and SMBC Aviation Capital, Fleet Tracker shows. In addition, the airline has 23 787 
widebodies.
Its Air Europa Express subsidiary now has five 737-800s, with the aforementioned new Orix delivery its sixth.
Earlier this month, Orix confirmed the placement of a fourth 737-800 with Transavia France.
Orix Aviation's managed portfolio decreased by 11 units to 141 in the year ended 31 March, and its owned fleet 
shrank by six aircraft to 51 units.
Its average remaining lease term is 7.3 years with an average aircraft age of 6.1 years.
The Air Europa group recently performed its final ATR turboprop service, following more than a decade of ATR 
operations.
The final flight was an ATR72 service between Alicante and Madrid.
Going forward, Air Europa's operations will be streamlined around the 737 and 787 families.

Asset finance and tax practitioner Caroline Devlin has retired from her role at Arthur Cox after more than 26 years 
of service.
She joined the law firm in 1997 and was a partner and co-chair of the Arthur Cox aviation group as well as a partner

Devlin said in a note that she is moving to providing advisory consulting services.

Ryanair will continue its strategy of using cash resources to fund its growth and repay debt, according to chief 
financial officer Neil Sorahan.
"We will pay back next month's (EURO)750 million bond using internal cash, like the (EURO)850 million bond 
repayment in March," he said.
Ryanair has another (EURO)850 million bond for repayment in September 2025 and (EURO)1.2 billion in May 
2026.
"If we see cheap pricing in the bond market, we will issue a bond," Sorahan commented, adding that the carrier 
would also consider Japanese operating lease with call option (Jolco) financing along with bank debt and sale and 
leaseback structures to finance its deliveries.
"But with raising interest rates the cheaper form of financing now is using our internal cash," he said, adding that 
Ryanair plans to use cash over the next two years.
In fiscal year 2024, Ryanair will reach peak capital expenditure (capex) with Max 8200 deliveries along with 
deposits for its Max 10 order. The carrier has allocated (EURO)2.8 billion of cash to fund capex. In fiscal year 2025, 
capex will be (EURO)1.5 billion.
Cash generation is fundamental to Ryanair's capex strategy, and chief executive officer Michael O'Leary said the 
carrier's priority has also been restoring staff pay cuts made in the Covid period.

Brazilian cargo operator Modern Logistics is set to take delivery of its first Boeing 737-800 converted freighter, 
expanding and upgrading its current fleet of three previous-generation 737 freighters.
Modern Logistics' first -800 freighter is undergoing final conversion works in Guangzhou.
Airfinance Journal's Fleet Tracker data shows that the aircraft belongs to BBAM's managed portfolio, with Incline 
Aviation as beneficial owner.
BBAM has about 30 Airbus and Boeing freighter units, although there are more in its conversion pipeline. BBAM 
also manages close to 100 737NG aircraft, leaving it well-equipped to place aircraft into conversion at relatively 
short notice.
The maiden 737-800 converted freighter for Modern Logistics was manufactured in 2004 and is equipped with 
CFM56-7B26 engines. Its last operator was Ryanair, from which Incline purchased the aircraft in 2022, Fleet 
Tracker shows.
Modern Logistics' three current freighters - two 737-300Fs and a 737-400F - are on lease from World Star Aviation, 
Automatic Leasing and KV Aviation, the data shows.
One of the 737-300Fs is already stored, the other has its lease expiring this month, Fleet Tracker shows.
In 2022, BBAM closed the Incline Aviation II fund, with total capital commitments of approximately $1.5 billion.
A diverse group of institutional investors committed to Incline Aviation II, including some of the world's largest public 
and private employee pension plans and sovereign wealth funds.
Incline Aviation II followed on from Incline Aviation I, a first-of-its-kind multi-strategy fund, closed in 2017 with total 
capital commitments of $931 million.
BBAM has more than 450 aircraft and $21 billion of assets under management. Its headquarters are in San

Irish carrier Ryanair will use cash flow to pay down maturing debt as it falls due over the next three years, while at 
the same time funding its aircraft capital expenditure (capex).
"Once we are confident that we can fully fund these large commitments, the Board will then consider restarting 
modest returns to shareholders, who supported Ryanair during the Covid pandemic," said the carrier. "We are 
conscious that our shareholders invested just over (EURO)400m during our Sept. 2020 share placing (during the 
depth of the Covid crisis), and this was key to Ryanair subsequently issuing an (EURO)850m bond which helped us 
to survive the devastating impact of the Covid pandemic on travel."
Ryanair's balance sheet stood at over (EURO)4.8 billion gross cash at 30 June. Net cash increased to (EURO)980 
million. The carrier said it is on track to repay its second 2023 bond of (EURO)750 million due next month and 
(EURO)2.8 billion of fiscal year 2024 capex from internal cash resources.
Ryanair took 21 Boeing 737 Max 8200s in the first quarter, to 30 June, and used internal resources to fund the 
associated (EURO)1 billion capex. It expects to take delivery of 49 Max 8200s by 31 March 2024, the end of its 
2024 fiscal year. By then its Max fleet will include 173 aircraft.
Total fleet stood at 558 aircraft, of which 119 were Max aircraft, at 30 June, and all of the group's 737 fleet is 
unencumbered. At the end of July the carrier plans a 124 Max fleet.
Ryanair said it originally expected 51 aircraft deliveries on or before 30 April, but the last of these deliveries was 
delayed into July. "We hope that our winter 2023/spring 2024 deliveries will be less impacted, but already there are 
indications from Boeing that some deliveries may be delayed from April 2024 to June 2024."
It added: "The large backlog of OEM aircraft deliveries is likely to constrain capacity growth in Europe for at least 
the next four years, which will enable Ryanair to further extend our market share gains as we take delivery of 
almost 100 Gamechangers [Max 8200s]over the next three summers."
In May it signed an order with Boeing to purchase 300 Boeing Max 10 aircraft (150 firm and 150 options) which, 
subject to shareholder approval, will be delivered between 2027 and 2033.
Ryanair prioritises debt repayment
For the April-June quarter, scheduled revenues increased 57% to (EURO)2.47 billion on the back ofan 11% 
increase in traffic. Total first-quarter revenue rose 40% to (EURO)3.65 billion while total operating costs increased 
23% to (EURO)2.94 billion, leaving an operating profit of (EURO)720 million. Net profit was (EURO)663 million.

Boeing's commercial airplanes division posted a 41% increase in second quarter 2023 revenue to $8.8 billion, 
driven by higher Boeing 787 deliveries.
The company handed over 20 787 widebodies to customers in the second quarter. Deliveries of the 787 only 
resumed in August 2022 following long-term production issues.
Overall the US manufacturer delivered 136 aircraft during the second quarter, a 12% year-on-year increase, with 
plans to increase 737 production to 38 aircraft per month from 31.
Nonetheless, Boeing said its commercial operating loss widened to $383 million from a $219 million loss in the 
same quarter of 2022, due to one-off costs and research and development expenses.
The company said it is still on track to reach 50 737 Max monthly production by 2025/2026.
On the widebody side, production for the 787 has increased to four units per month, with plans to ramp to five per 
month in late 2023 and 10 per month by around 2025.
Boeing also saw an increase in backlog, with 460 net orders booked in the second quarter, including 220 for Air 
India and 39 for Riyadh Air. It also secured a commitment from Ryanair for up to 300 737 Max 10s.
At the end of the quarter, Boeing's backlog included over 4,800 aircraft valued at $363 billion, compared with $329 
billion at the end of December 2022.
"We had a solid second quarter with improved deliveries and strong free cash flow generation. We are well

Heathrow Airport has named the current Copenhagen Airport boss, Thomas Woldbye, as chief executive John 
Holland-Kaye's replacement when he steps down.
Woldbye spent 12 years as the boss of the Danish airport, and brings with him a "wealth of experience and a 
proven track record as a CEO of a major airport," Heathrow said in a statement.
Heathrow added that Woldbye forged strong links with the Danish Government, who are part owners of 
Copenhagen Airport and fostered partnerships with airlines to drive investment and development, including 
significant recent expansions in terminal capacity at the airport.
Prior to joining Copenhagen Airport in 2011, he spent 27 years at Møller-Mærsk, a global shipping and ferry 
company.
"I have personally experienced how the excellent team at Heathrow has successfully improved both the 
infrastructure and the service to passengers over the past years to create a strong platform for further success," 
said Woldbye.
"Heathrow is an important engine for the British economy and inextricably linked to the success of London and the 
wider UK," he added.
John Strickland, director at airline consultant JLS Consulting, notes he brings a great deal of experience in "dealing 
with low-cost carriers" such as Ryanair.

"These relationships are challenging in terms of cost negotiations & could be valuable at Heathrow which faces 
difficult relationships with its airline customers on the same topic," Strickland said.

Consumer group Which? has lashed out at the government for allowing UK airlines to allegedly breach consumer 
laws for over twenty years.
No airlines have faced fines in the UK over the past 20 years, Which? argued, despite hundreds of thousands of 
customers taking to courts to battle for refunds on cancelled flights.
Lashing out at the government, Which? urged that UK regulator the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) be granted 
powers to impose fines on airlines failing to issue adequate refunds.
British Airways, easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) have all faced penalties in other countries over 
failures to repay customers, while similar cases in the UK go unchecked, Which? pointed out.
"If your flight is cancelled you are entitled to a refund or prompt rerouting to your destination," the group said.
However, some 14,000 passengers complained of being unable to access refunds in just six weeks as the 
pandemic hit in 2020, resulting in "no enforcement action".
"We passed this evidence to the CAA, but it only requested a commitment from airlines that they would begin to 
refund passengers," the group continued.
"Not only were airlines breaking the rules [...] there appeared to be no consequences for doing so."
British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair all denied breaking any laws, with the former apologising for customer service 
issues during the pandemic.
Government urged to tackle airlines' unchecked 'unfair practices'
The CAA agreed that the government should grant it "stronger" enforcement powers meanwhile, adding: "This 
would allow us to take faster action when appropriate."
Shares in British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) fell on the news, alongside 
those in easyJet and Ryanair.

Ryanair’s
big problem
Ryanair’s agreement to take the Boeing 737 Max 10 will present the airline with an operational vulnerability as it 
adapts to the larger aircraft type.
While group chief financial officer Neil Sorahan, during a briefing on the deal, deadpanned that the airline will be 
putting in “very comfortable first-class seats for all of our customers”, chief executive Michael O’Leary considered 
the practicality of maintaining 25min turnaround times with a 228-seat jet.
“We’ll be [having] special training programmes for our customers for the next 10 years on how to move faster, travel 
with fewer bags,” he said. “We have no doubt we’ll do 25-minute turnarounds when it’s raining. But when it’s sunny 
and we’re getting them on and off the back of the aircraft, this is going to be a challenge.”
O’Leary says the airline will be working closely with its customers to “incentivise” them, but he’s obviously just 
joking. Maybe. Perhaps.
Wellington reboot
Experts have restored a Second World War Vickers Wellington to its original glory after more than 10 years of work.
The bomber – one of only two remaining – is now on public display at the Royal Air Force Museum Midlands’ new 
Bomber Command exhibition.
The Wellington, with its Barnes Wallis-designed geodetic fuselage, was a night bomber in the early years of the 
conflict, and by 1942 had become the most numerous type in Bomber Command before four-engined bombers 
such as the Halifax and Lancaster began to replace them.
Vickers built the museum’s example in 1944 and it served with the No 1 Air Navigation Training School from 1949 
to 1953. Although it was not operational during the war, the museum says the example represents the bomber’s 
contribution to the war effort.
No Headline In Original
It had been on display at the RAF Museum’s site in London until 2010, before moving to the Conservation Centre in 
the Midlands for treatment on corrosion to its structure and replacement of its fragile, Irish linen skin.
The bomber is one of only two examples remaining

What the blazes?
Sometimes a news headline does not deliver the story expected, and so it was when we read: “Car completely 
destroyed in fire on A380”.
Was this a bit of massive aviation safety news that had somehow evaded industry journalists worldwide – but been 
picked up by the… er… Teignmouth Post?
Perhaps the source should have provided a clue.
The A380 is the A road that connects Torbay and Exeter. A conflagration in an abandoned Volvo – no injuries 
reported – was no doubt interesting news in a corner of south Devon, but probably did not account for the story 
becoming one of the most-viewed articles that day on a certain UK news aggregation site.
Just for lavs
Kudos to someone at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for their choice of phrasing when they 
were drawing up a recent airworthiness directive on Airbus A350 lavatories.
The 17 May directive refers to discovery of corrosion on floor fittings, and instructs operators to conduct repetitive 
inspection on the affected parts.
EASA warns that the condition could lead to “lavatory module detachment”, with possible injury to cabin crew or 
passengers.
But it also cautions that the sudden departure of the toilet from its foundations could result in “reduced evacuation 
capacity”.
A quick final plug for the Guild of Aviation Artists’ Aviation Paintings of the Year exhibition. If you missed the show 
at the Imperial War Museum, Duxford over the weekend of 23-25 June, there is a chance to view the works at

Lódz in a decade: 40 flights a week on 7 routes.
"Malaga is the second Spanish destination at our airport. Our passengers love Spain and want to relax there all 
year. The proof of this is the planes to Alicante are full. From October, it will be possible to go to Malaga twice a 
week, while to Alicante the frequency will increase, and will be three times a week. We hope passengers will love 
Malaga as much as Alicante. It's not all. From winter season, Ryanair will back the connection from Lodz to 
Nottingham that many people are waiting for." - said Anna Midera, CEO and President of the Board of Lodz Airport
"The launch of a destination like Malaga is another proof of our very good cooperation with Ryanair. Malaga is not 
available at many airports in Poland, so we are glad that we can offer this destination to our inhabitants from Lódz 
and Lódz region. We are also happy that from October 30th, Ryanair will fly again between Lódz and 
Nottingham/East Midlands. The third good news is for passengers traveling to London. From October 27th, Ryanair 
is increasing the flights' frequency to London Stansted. Planes will fly to STN 7 days a week. We have never had 
such a frequency of this connection before. In total, Ryanair will offer 40 flights a week on 7 routes, it will be the 
largest network of Ryanair from LCJ since decade" - added Robert Makowski, Commercial Director of Lodz Airport.

Sudden take-off European airports body calls for regulators to probe rising cost of air travel
Sudden take-off European airports body calls for regulators to probe rising 
cost of air travel

A senior European airport executive has called on regulators to scrutinise the cost of airfares after a surge in ticket 
prices this year.
Olivier Jankovec, director-general of airport trade body ACI Europe, said ticket prices had risen 30 per cent year on 
year in Europe and regulators should "monitor the level of airfares, and check whether there is no abuse of pricing 
power".
Ticket prices have shot up despite the weak economic backdrop thanks to a combination of huge demand since the 
end of pandemic restrictions and a shortage of aircraft.
Jankovec said he was not asking for airfares to be capped, but that it was "legitimate" to question why many major 
airports had their landing fees capped while airlines were free to charge whatever they wanted.
Regulators such as the Civil Aviation Authority in the UK oversee consumer protection, including passenger rights 
during disruption. The CAA has intervened over problems such as last summer's travel chaos.
But while national regulators can cap landing fees that airports charge, they have no role in setting airfares. One 
executive at a European regulator said it would be "challenging" to control ticket prices.
Sudden take-off European airports body calls for regulators to probe rising cost of air travel
Jankovec said airlines "continue to cry and whine" about airport landing charges, which are passed on to 
passengers through airfares, while "exerting massive pricing power" by raising ticket prices.
In response, trade group Airlines for Europe, which represents carriers including easyJet, Ryanair and British
Airways, said competition among airlines had helped drive down airfares and "delivered affordable air travel for 
millions of European consumers".
"Ultimately, airports - especially larger ones - still function as natural monopolies, necessitating firm regulatory 
oversight to keep them in check," it said.
Airlines and airports have regularly clashed as the industry has recovered from the pandemic.
London's Heathrow has been the site of the biggest disagreements, with airlines including BA and Virgin Atlantic 
leading a successful push to stop the airport raising its fees by 90 per cent following the pandemic.
ACI Europe said Europe's airports posted a combined net profit of (EURO)6.4bn in 2022, the industry's first since 
2019. But it said this had partly been achieved by companies "significantly" cutting capital investment.
The industry body said the number of cities connected by air travel in Europe had fallen 16 per cent since 2019 as 
airlines have prioritised the busiest and most lucrative routes.

 The European Commission may not file an appeal against a court's veto of its earlier approval for a 6 billion-euro 
state bailout package for Germany's Lufthansa (LHA.F) amid limited options, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing 
people familiar with the matter.
The Luxembourg-based General Court repealed the antitrust regulator's clearance of the state bailout in May 
following a challenge launched by Irish airline Ryanair (RYA.IR). Europe's second-highest court also criticized the 
commission for the lack of incentives that would accelerate Lufthansa's repayment of the aid.
The sources noted that any potential appeal will be limited to points of law, adding that the German air carrier has 
already repaid the aid in full. 
Lufthansa rose 1% on Wednesday's close.

France's civil air authority said Thursday it had ordered airlines to cancel flights to and from three airports because 
of a strike by air traffic controllers.
The airports include Beauvais - the main French hub for Irish carrier Ryanair and other budget airlines - as well as 
Brest, in the far west of the country, and Carcassonne, in the south.
The DGAC air authority had asked Wednesday for half the Beauvais flights to be cancelled, but Thursday called for 
a complete grounding of planes "given the widespread support for the strike seen at air traffic controller unions in 
Beauvais, Brest and Carcassonne".
The strike, over working conditions, follows sporadic stoppages by air traffic controllers seen between March and 
May in protest against the government's reform of the French pensions system.
Thursday's strike did not affect the main French airports, the DGAC said, or carriers flying over France.
Beauvais, some 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Paris, is France's 10th busiest airport with 4.6 million passengers 
in 2022.

 Shares of Ryanair Holdings plc (RYAAY) scaled a 52-week high of $110.17 in the trading session on Jun 28, 2023, 
before closing a tad lower at $109.48. 
The company's shares have gained 46.5% year to date, significantly higher than 33.7% growth of the industry[1] it 
belongs to. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Let's find out the factors supporting the uptick. 
Passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air traffic from the 
pandemic lows. Ryanair has raised its traffic view for fiscal 2023 to 185 million (prior view: 168 million). Ryanair's 
fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
$1,908.7 million and improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
Meanwhile, Ryanair recently reported highly impressive traffic numbers for May, driven by upbeat air-travel 
demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in May was 17 million. This compared favorably with 
the April 2023 figure of 16 million and 15.4 million in May 2022. Owing to upbeat traffic, the load factor (percentage 
of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 94% in May compared with 92% a year ago. The company operated 
more than 94,400 flights in May. 
Ryanair's measures to expand its fleet to cater to the improvement in air-travel demand are encouraging. RYAAY's 
total fleet included 537 aircraft as of Mar 31, 2023. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Ryanair currently carries a 
Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation[2] sector are Copa Holdings CPA[3] 
and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[4]. Each of these companies presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 
You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here[5]. 
Copa Holdings has an expected earnings growth rate of 75.42% for the current year. CPA delivered a trailing four-
quarter earnings surprise of 14.60%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CPA's current-year earnings has improved 25.5% over the past 90 days. 
Shares of CPA have soared 28.6% over the past six months. 
Ryanair ( RYAAY ) Hits 52-Week High: What's Driving the Stock?
Allegiant has an expected earnings growth rate of more than 100% for the current year. ALGT delivered a trailing 
four-quarter earnings surprise of 79.78%, on average. 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ALGT's current-year earnings has improved 46.5% over the past 90 days.

Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), the cloud computing subsidiary of Amazon, has announced its significant 
investment in the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI). With a $100 million commitment, the new 
AWS Generative AI Innovation Center aims to support customers and partners globally in their quest to harness the 
potential of generative AI. This move, with its direct engagement approach, could open up fresh opportunities for 
small business owners to innovate and leverage AI technology.
Generative AI, a type of machine learning (ML) that can create new data instances like images, sound, and text, 
can prove transformative across industries. The AWS Generative AI Innovation Center seeks to leverage this 
capability, assisting businesses in envisioning, designing, and launching new generative AI products, services, and 
processes. This initiative builds on AWS's longstanding commitment to AI technology development, and its goal to 
bring this technology to customers and partners worldwide.
'Customers around the globe are hungry for guidance about how to get started quickly and securely with generative 
AI,' said Matt Garman, senior vice president of Sales, Marketing, and Global Services at AWS. The new center is in 
line with the AWS objective of helping every organization leverage AI, providing flexible and cost-effective 
generative AI services alongside a team of AI experts.
The team at the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center will work closely with customers to develop bespoke 
solutions harnessing the power of generative AI. For small businesses, this could mean opportunities to reinvent 
their offerings and operations. From accelerating research and development to personalizing customer experience, 
generative AI's potential is vast and versatile.
Customers will also benefit from no-cost workshops, engagements, and training offered by AWS, helping them 
identify use cases that create the greatest value for their businesses. From model selection to proofs of concept, 
the AWS team will guide businesses in navigating technical or business challenges and planning for large-scale 
solution launches.
AWS Launches $100M Generative AI Innovation Center
The center will also provide access to various generative AI services, including Amazon CodeWhisperer and 
Amazon Bedrock, which use foundational models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon Titan. 
Furthermore, AWS will offer high-performance infrastructure and tools like AWS Inferentia-powered Amazon EC2 
Inf1 Instances, AWS Trainium-powered Amazon EC2 Trn1 Instances, Amazon EC2 P5 instances powered by 
NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon SageMaker Jumpstart.
Several companies, including Highspot, Lonely Planet, Ryanair, and Twilio, have already begun engaging with the 
Innovation Center to explore developing generative AI solutions.
Highspot's Vice President of Science, Kurt Berglund, acknowledges the transformative potential of generative AI 
and how the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center is assisting them in confronting complex challenges at scale. 
Similarly, Twilio sees AWS as a valuable technology partner in predictive AI and is excited about future 
collaboration around generative AI.
For small businesses, the establishment of the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center signifies an accessible 
avenue for AI adoption. By leveraging AWS's investment and expertise in AI, small businesses could revolutionize 
their offerings, streamline operations, and offer more value to their customers. The initiative underscores the 
increasing relevance of AI for businesses of all sizes and the need for small business owners to consider this as 
part of their strategic planning.

algorithms are used to create new content, such as audio, code, images, texts, simulations, and videos. 
Amazon[1] said Highspot, Twilio, Ryanair and Lonely Planet will be among the first users of the innovation center. 
With the new center, the company expects to sell more cloud services amidst an increasing competition in the cloud 
infrastructure market.  
A recent analysis from Synergy Research Group comparing the biggest cloud services providers shows[4] that 
enterprise spending on cloud solutions reached $63 billion worldwide in the first quarter of 2023, up 20% from the 
same quarter last year. 
Microsoft and Google[2] had the strongest year-over-year growth rates, gaining 23% and 10% in worldwide market 
share, respectively. Amazon[1], the leader in cloud infrastructure, kept its 32% market share in Q1.

'We will bring our internal AWS experts free-of-charge to a whole bunch of AWS customers, focusing on folks with 
significant AWS presence, and go help them turbocharge their efforts to get real with generative AI, get beyond the 
talk,' AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said at Bloomberg's Tech Summit.  
As part of its strategy to stand up against big tech competitors, Amazon[1] recently debuted Bedrock[5], an AI 
solution that allows customers to build out their own ChatGPT-like models. The company also announced the 
upcoming Titan, which includes two new foundational models developed by Amazon[1] Machine Learning. 
On LinkedIn, recent opening positions for AI engineers show Amazon[1] is also preparing to implement a new 
'search' functionality[6] powered by AI for its online web store, with a ChatGPT-like interface.

Every order placed with Boeing at the Paris Air Show
Every order placed with Boeing at the Paris Air Show

Highlight: As the Paris Air Show comes to a close, Boeing will be celebrating a successful week as it moves 
forward with a healthy set of orders from airlines around the world.
Body
Following an obvious dip during the pandemic, the aviation industry has seen a relatively healthy recovery recently 
which has been reflected in Boeing's order book with over 1,000 aircraft orders and commitments placed with the 
company in the last year.  Subsequently, the aircraft manufacturer has built on its already strong start to the year, 
including a record order from Ryanair, with firm orders at the international show for 286 jets and commitments or 
options for over 70 more.  Air India  The largest order of the week came from one of the biggest airlines in Asia, Air 
India, which ordered up to 290 aircraft across a variety of Boeing models.  The Tata Group company's order 
included 190 737 MAXs, 20 787 Dreamliners and 10 777X jets as well as options for another 50 737 MAXs and 20 
787 Dreamliners.  First announced in February, the order was finalised at the Paris Air Show and is Boeing's largest 
order in South Asia, a region which is expected to triple its fleet in the next two decades.  The investment from Air 
India forms part of the airline's Vihaan.AI transformation plan looking to build its presence both internationally and in 
the domestic market, where it currently sits behind rival Indigo, which also placed a historic order with Airbus this 
week.  Avolon  Credit: Boeing Another relatively large order for Boeing came not from an airline but from leasing 
company Avolon, which ordered 40 of the 737 MAX jets, specifically the 737-8.  CEO Andy Cronin said the order 
showed Avolon's confidence in future customer demand for the model, with its delivery pipeline now stretching 
through to 2023, thanks to the reduction in fuel use and emissions offered by the 737 MAXs when compared to 
similar models.  Cronin said: "The transitioning of the global fleet to more fuel-efficient new-technology aircraft is a 
priority for our industry and we are looking to play a leading role by supporting airlines in achieving their 
sustainability objectives."  Air Algérie  While Boeing will be happy with the two larger purchases by Air India and 
Avolon, the manufacturer was also able to pick up several smaller orders, including one from Air Algérie for eight of 
the 737 MAX jets. 
Alongside confirming that order, Air Algérie also signed a memorandum of understanding for two 737-800 Boeing 
Converted Freighters as the airline looks to meet growing demand in the region.  Air Algérie general manager 
Yacine Benslimane said that the order of the 737 MAX, specifically from the 737-9 family, was part of the airline's 
Every order placed with Boeing at the Paris Air Show
wider fleet extension strategy.  China Airlines  Taiwan-based China Airlines was responsible for another of the 
smaller Boeing orders at the Paris Air Show as it finalised a purchase of eight 787-9 Dreamliners.  The order 
continues a recently developed demand for the model by the airline after it placed its first order for 16 of the jets last 
year.  However, the company has also decided to slightly expand its options as it has converted six of its 787-9s on 
order to 787-10s, the largest of the 787 family.  Luxair  Credit: Boeing Despite only placing a relatively small order 
for four Boeing 737-7s, part of the 737 MAX family, Luxembourg airline Luxair will still be making history as the 
European launch customer for the model.  The commitment comes only shortly after the airline placed an order for 
four 737-8s, as it looks to "secure a long-term future" for the company, according to CEO Gilles Feith.  Feith further 
said: "This type of aircraft is a perfect match for Luxair and will meet the requirements of the market. Seating 160 
passengers, the 737-7 will offer flexibility across the Luxair destination network while significantly reducing fuel 
consumption."  Luxair will also be leasing two 737-8s ahead of taking delivery of the first in its own order.  Akasa 
Air  Although not as large as Air India, Akasa Air was another Indian airline to work on expanding its fleet at the 
Paris Air Show with an order for four 737 MAXs, in the 737-8 range.  The order is an expansion of the airline's 
existing backlog, which will now consist of 23 737-8s and 53 737-8-200s.  Air Lease Corporation  Credit: Boeing 
The smallest order of the week for Boeing came from another leasing company in Air Lease Corporation, 
purchasing two 787 Dreamliners to add to its fleet.  The company has been a long-standing customer of the 787 
family since placing its first order of the 787-9 in 2010.  Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal 
said: "ALC is a key strategic leasing partner to Boeing and we are delighted that it continues to see the value 
proposition of the 787 family for its customers."

European consumer organizations, BEUC, according to a Thursday release.
BEUC and its 23 member organizations launched a complaint to the European Commission as well as the network 
of consumer protection authorities against "greenwashing" by the airlines, saying it violates EU rules against unfair 
commercial practices.
The complaint named a total of 17 airlines including Air France-KLM Group (AF.PA) units AirFrance and KLM, 
Finnair (FIA1S.HE), Lufthansa (LHA.F), Ryanair (RYA.IR), SAS (SAS.ST, SAS-DKK.CO, SASNO.OL), Wizz Air

It's a first step.
Or is it a ploy?
Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, has a bit of a reputation for rowdiness. For some reason, that is especially true on 
flights back and forth from Spain, particularly in the resort area of Ibiza.
No more.
Ryanair has banned alcohol purchases by passengers in duty-free shops (read: cheap and plentiful) on flights to 
and from Spain to help curb excess drinking. But some critics think it's just a ploy to get passengers to buy more 
alcohol on board the flight. In addition to the rowdiness, Ryanair also has a reputation of making a fortune on 
ancillary fees. CEO Michael O'Leary someday hoped he could run the entire airline without selling tickets and just 
making money on ancillary fees. He also once entertained the idea of coin-operated bathrooms.
It's also unknown whether limiting passengers' personal alcohol is just a trial run.
Most aviation authorities ban alcohol that is not served by a flight attendant, but the rules are often flouted.
In an emailed statement to passengers, Ryanair said:
"In order to prioritize the comfort and safety of all passengers, Ryanair will implement the following restrictions on 
your upcoming flight to Spain. Customers will not be allowed to carry alcohol on board and all cabin baggage will be 
searched at the boarding gates. Any alcohol purchased in airport shops or elsewhere must be packed carefully in a 
suitable item of cabin baggage, which will be tagged at the gate and then placed in the aircraft hold free of charge if 
you have purchased priority boarding or have a small piece of hand luggage. If the bag is unsuitable for placing in 
the hold (e.g. plastic bag) then customers will be required to dispose of the alcohol in the bins provided."
The ban is for flights from the United Kingdom to such itineraries in Spain as Alicante, Barcelona, Ibiza, Malaga, 
Palma and Tenerife South.

Umbrella European consumer protection organization BEUC and 23 of its members filed a complaint with the 
European Commission on Thursday against 17 European airlines, saying they misled the public about their 
environmental policies.
Lufthansa, Air France and Ryanair are among the airlines targeted by a so-called cease-and-desist complaint. The 
consumer groups claim the airlines breached EU rules on unfair commercial practices.
The 23 member organizations come from 19 EU countries, the BEUC wrote in a press release. The German 
consumer group VZBV is part of the action, which complains about so-called "greenwashing" practices, in which 
companies present policies as environmentally friendly when they are not.
"We are calling for a Europe-wide investigation into the issue and for the concerned airlines - and the entire sector - 
to stop making claims that give consumers the impression that flying is sustainable," the statement said.
"This is simply untrue as flying is not sustainable and is not bound to become so in the near future."
BEUC said its members had found numerous examples of misleading practices. For example, claims that CO2 
emissions can be "offset," "neutralized" or "compensated" are factually incorrect. The benefits of offsetting 
measures are highly uncertain, while the damage caused by CO2 emissions from air travel is certain.
The claim that air travel can be "sustainable", "responsible" or "green" is also misleading.
"None of the strategies employed by the aviation sector are currently capable of preventing greenhouse gas 
emissions."
Lufthansa said it had taken note of BEUC's announcement but had not yet received any complaints.
European consumers file 'greenwashing' complaint against airlines
"Irrespective of this, we naturally deal with every complaint we receive and examine it carefully," the airline said 
when queried for a response.
The group is striving for a neutral CO2 balance by 2050. By 2030, net CO2 emissions are to be halved compared to 
2019 through reduction and compensation measures.

European airlines have been hit by a consumer complaint filed with the EU's executive arm accusing the 17 
companies of greenwashing, the practice of making misleading climate-related claims.
The European Consumer Organisation, or BEUC, said Thursday the claims made by the airlines breach EU rules 
on unfair commercial practices.
The BEUC called for a Europe-wide investigation and for airlines to "stop making claims that give consumers the 
impression that flying is sustainable".
"We urge authorities to take the matter into their hands and crack down on this greenwashing practice seriously 
misleading consumers," BEUC deputy director general Ursula Pachl said in a statement.
"Airlines must stop giving consumers the false impression that they are choosing a sustainable transport mode," 
Pachl said.
Greenwashing is when companies use deceptive claims to convince the public that its products or operations are 
environmentally friendly.
The complaint targets Air Baltic, Air Dolomiti, Air France, Austrian, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Finnair, KLM, 
Lufthansa, Norwegian, Ryanair, SAS, SWISS, TAP, Volotea, Vueling and Wizz Air.
The BEUC said airlines are misleading consumers by charging them more to contribute to the development of 
sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are "not market-ready" and will only represent a minor share of a plane's 
fuel mix once they finally become widely available.
The group also denounced claims that paying extra credits can "offset" or "compensate" for a flight's CO2 
emissions.
European airlines hit by 'greenwashing' complaint
An Air France-KLM spokesman said the Franco-Dutch group was "paying increased attention to the precision of 
these messages" and that it was the world's biggest buyer of sustainable aviation fuels last year.
Germany's Lufthansa said it plans to slash its net emissions by half by 2030 compared to 2019 levels and has a 
"constant dialogue" with customers.

Southend Airport sale process kicks off, but analysts expect lengthy timescale
Southend Airport sale process kicks off, but analysts expect lengthy

Southend Aiport has been put up for sale by owner Esken Ltd (LSE:ESKN, OTC:ESKNF) as the aviation-come-
renewables company's financial woes grow.
Despite recovering demand for aviation and a recent deal for easyJet PLC to operate from Southend, Esken 
confirmed the airport was up for sale in Wednesday's full-year results.
"The case for the airport remains well founded, as demonstrated by the increase in routes served by easyJet," 
Esken executive chairman David Shearer said.
Esken reported a rise in net debt by 17.3% to £290mln over the year, as total group revenue also grew by almost 
15% to £120mln.
Liberum analysts expect the sale will be a lengthy process though, with Esken potentially putting off valuing the 
airport to allow the sector more time to recover.
"As airline capacity levels return to pre-pandemic levels we anticipate that London airport capacity constraints will 
once again become binding, leaving Southend Airport as the sole source of incremental airport capacity in the south 
east," Liberum noted.
easyJet restarted flights from Southend in late March, amid a new multi-year deal which sees it fly to the likes of 
Amsterdam, Majora and Malaga from the site.
Southend Airport sale process kicks off, but analysts expect lengthy timescale
Rivals Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) and Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) have dismissed speculation that 
they could set up routes from the Essex airport anytime soon meanwhile, leaving easyJet the airfield's sole current 
commercial operator.
Some 2.04mln passengers passed through Southend Airport in 2019, according to Statista data, which marked the 
last full year before the Covid-19 pandemic grounded the industry.
Commercial flights then restarted from the airport in May 2022, with neither Wizz nor Ryanair ruling out eventual 
flights from the airport as demand recovers and more hubs around London are required.

Darren Gill, a 33-year-old individual, caused a disturbance during a Ryanair flight from Manchester Airport (MAN) to 
Santander Airport (SDR) in Spain. The flight, which was originally scheduled to depart at 13:00 local time, faced a 
seven-hour delay, providing Gill with an opportunity to indulge in alcohol at the airport bars.
As a result of excessive drinking, Gill boarded the aircraft intoxicated and proceeded to engage in abusive behavior 
towards his partner, who was seated at the back of the plane. Cabin crew members sought the assistance of police 
officers when Gill failed to cooperate and continued to disregard flight safety announcements and briefings.
Upon boarding the plane, the officers noted Gill's evident intoxication - he exhibited slurred speech and was 
unsteady on his feet. Despite the intervention, Gill confronted the police officers, and his behavior led to further 
confrontations.
Following the incident, Gill faced legal consequences and was brought to Manchester Magistrates Court, where he 
confessed to being drunk on an aircraft. As a result, he received a fine of £459 ($585), along with a £184 ($235) 
victim surcharge and £85 ($108) in costs.
The altercation took place on July 26, 2022. The Manchester Evening News also reported that Gill had a history of 
67 previous offenses, including a public order matter back in 2004.

Newstex)  
 Environmental concerns are one of several factors driving up airfares. DW explores what's behind the price 
hikes.The days of cheap air fares are over in Europe. In most places, a return to pre-pandemic flight pricing seems 
to be nowhere in sight. This is confirmed, for example, by figures from the German Federal Statistical Office, which 
reported that the average price of an international flight in April 2023 was 33.4% higher than a year prior. 
"Just as we are all currently experiencing huge cost increases, driven particularly by high fuel and energy prices, 
costs are going up for airlines, airports, maintenance companies and service providers," says aviation expert Cord 
Schellenberg. In addition, demand for air travel in Europe has been very high since travel became more affordable. 
But flight capacities are not as high as they were in 2019. "So high demand is meeting tight supply." 
According to figures from the German Aviation Association (BDL), air traffic in Germany last year was 70% of what 
it was in 2019. "This means that the recovery in Germany is slower than in other European countries where in 2022, 
flight offers were at 84% of what they were in 2019," the BDL said in its latest industry report. 
Pricey summer flights  
The online price comparison website Idealo recently reported that summer flight fares were up 20% from last year. 
"At the moment, passengers are willing to pay the higher prices," says Schellenberg. "It remains to be seen whether 
this is due to the catch-up effect — that people can finally travel again after the pandemic — or a general change in 
attitude. Air travel may simply cost more because it used to be too cheap." 
Yet Christoph Brützel, a professor of air traffic management at the International University of Applied Sciences in 
Bad Honnef, Germany, expects prices to drop, at least in the short term. "Next year, they will likely fall again," he 
suspects. Brützel says price drops will result from airlines starting to increase their capacity. 
No more super cheap fares 
Nevertheless, there is much to suggest there will be no return to the sometimes extremely low plane fares of the 
past. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, for example, recently admitted that the days of €10 ($10.80) bargain tickets 
are over. The airline's average ticket prices will rise €40 to €50 ($43-$57) over the next few years, he told the BBC. 
The main reason, he said, is high jet fuel prices. This is confirmed by Harald Zeiss, a professor at Harz University of 
Applied Sciences in Wernigerode, Germany, whose research focuses on sustainability in tourism. "Fossil fuels will 
become very expensive," he says. "If you rely on kerosene, you will have no choice but to pass on the rising costs 
to customers," he told DW. 
Why the era of low-cost flights in Europe may be over
This is especially true as the aviation industry comes under increasing pressure to answer for the environmental 
damage it causes. "The environmental costs of flying should be reflected much more strongly in airfares," says 
Werner Reh, a spokesman for the transport working group at the environmental protection association BUND. "One 
ton of CO2 causes climate damage amounting to €180 ($195)," he says. The simplest way to price this in, he says, 
is with a kerosene tax. An economy flight from Germany to the Dominican Republic would be about €180 ($195) 
more expensive, he calculates. However, Reh says implementing such a tax at the international level would be 
"extremely difficult." 
Sustainable fuels drive up costs 
The increasing use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is more likely to drive up costs for airlines in the coming 
years. The EU's "Fit for 55" measures, for example, which aim to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 
2030, stipulates that moresustainable aviation fuels are used, including mixed fuels. For airlines, this means fuel 
cost increases of up to 16% per ton compared to pure fossil kerosene, according to a recently presented study by 
auditing firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers Germany. "Those who want to fly more sustainably in the future will have to 
pay more for it," says Jan Wille, co-author of the study. 
Meanwhile, the economic research institute SEO Amsterdam Economics has calculated that the "Fit for 55" 
package will increase the price of a return flight within Europe over a distance of 3,000 kilometers by €45 ($49) by 
2030 and by €65 ($71) by 2035. Meanwhile, in another study, researchers found that eliminating greenhouse gas 
emissions from European aviation by 2050, as targeted, will cost a total of €820 billion ($897 billion). One 
consequence of this, researchers say, will be higher ticket prices.

Boeing Takes Early Action to Pre-Wire 737 MAX Aircraft for Upcoming EU Aviation Safety Changes
Boeing Takes Early Action to Pre-Wire 737 MAX Aircraft for Upcoming EU 
Aviation Safety Changes

Boeing has proactively started pre-wiring its 737 MAX aircraft to rework the Angle of Attack (AoA) system, well 
ahead of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) mandate. According to Bob Michael, the 737 
Customer Leader, all currently built airplanes have been equipped with the required wiring in preparation for 
anticipated changes since the summer of 2022. This move comes as part of the aircraft's compliance with EASA's 
regulations, which demand adjustments to the AoA system.
In response to EASA's directives, Boeing has been diligently working on a Service Bulletin (SB) to provide 
necessary information for airlines operating the 737 MAX. The changes to the AoA system were initially set forth by 
EASA when they lifted the grounding of the aircraft in January 2021. Among other requirements, Boeing had to 
incorporate the MAX Display System (MDS) with the "AOA DISAGREE" functionality and modify the stabilizer trim 
control wiring.
Since June 2022, Boeing has successfully built 355 aircraft for 37 different airlines worldwide. In the European 
Union, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has produced 53 aircraft for seven airlines, with 46 of them 
being assigned to the Ryanair group, five of which are registered under Malta Air.
EASA's post Return to Service (RTS) mandates include integrity enhancements to the AoA system, specifically 
developed and certified for the 737 MAX-10, as well as updates to the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and a non-
critical Systems Safety Analysis (SSA) verification. EASA expressed confidence in the combined efforts, stating that 
they provide the necessary elements to ensure the safe operation of the 737 MAX.
Looking ahead, EASA and Boeing have agreed on two critical post-grounding changes: improving the AoA system's 
integrity, which will be integrated into the 737 MAX-10 and retrofitted across the entire fleet, and conducting further 
evaluation of the Crew Alerting System (CAS).
In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will mandate modern flight crew alerting systems for 
737 MAXs through the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act (ACSAA). While the Omnibus 
Appropriations Bill permits Boeing to proceed with the 737 MAX-7 and MAX-10 certification without a deadline, it 
also requires all 737 MAXs to be retrofitted with modernized versions of the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting 
System (EICAS) one year after the 737 MAX-10 is certified.
Boeing Takes Early Action to Pre-Wire 737 MAX Aircraft for Upcoming EU Aviation Safety Changes
Boeing is optimistic about the certification timeline for the 737 MAX-7 and MAX-10, with expectations for approval in 
2023 and 2024, respectively.

Rolls-Royce chief eyes narrowbody market amid Paris Air Show dealings
Rolls-Royce chief eyes narrowbody market amid Paris Air Show dealings

Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) shares were boosted on Tuesday as deals flew at the Paris Air Show and 
boss Tufan Erginibilgic hinted toward a return to the narrow-body jet market.
Rolls-Royce is developing a new "scalable" engine, known as the Ultrafan, which Erginibilgic confirmed could be 
used on smaller aircraft, though this is not expected to be rolled out before 2030.
"I believe this positions us well to participate in narrow-body if and when it comes," he told reporters at the event on 
Tuesday.
"The demonstrator is working really well," he added, "we did it intentionally so that we can actually scale down all 
the way to narrow-body".
Eginibilgic also hinted Rolls-Royce could enter a partnership to get back into the market, with the firm having 
previously worked alongside Pratt & Whitney from 1983 to 2011 on Airbus A320 engines.
Rolls-Royce is a key player in the wide-body commercial airline market, offering engines to power the likes of 
Boeing 777s, 787s and Airbus A330s and A380s.
However, the FTSE 100-listed manufacturer does not offer engines for narrow-body jets used by short-haul carriers 
like Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and easyJet PLC, with previous chief executive Warren East simply blaming 
a lack of opportunity.
Rolls-Royce chief eyes narrowbody market amid Paris Air Show dealings
Already-established partnerships between the likes of General Electric (NYSE:GE) and French firm Safran have 
also made it difficult for Rolls-Royce to enter the market, JP Morgan said.
The narrow-body market has boomed in recent years, especially so since the pandemic, with Airbus Group 
(EPA:AIR) penning a record order for 500 A320 variants at the air show on Monday.
As the short-haul sector has neared recovery from the effects of Covid-19, long-haul carriers have trailed behind, 
marking a blow for Rolls-Royce which is paid based on engine flying times.
Despite a flurry of orders for narrow-body jets being signed at the Paris air show on Monday and Tuesday, Rolls-
Royce has also penned several of its own deals.
The manufacturer will continue to provide engine support for Tunisair and Egyptair-operated Airbus A330s under 
deals signed on Monday.
A host of orders between The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) and airlines could also benefit Rolls-Royce, with the 
787 Dreamliners being sold able to be powered by the company's Trent 1000 engines.
Rolls-Royce shares climbed 2% to 156.8p.

Highlight: The aviation giant's CMO report has forecast passenger traffic to continue outpacing global economic 
growth.
Body
International air traffic will recover to pre-pandemic levels and $8trn worth of new commercial jets will be ordered in 
the next 20 years, according to Boeing's latest Commercial Market Outlook (CMO) report. Released ahead of this 
week's Paris Air Show, the CMO also found that the global commercial fleet will double to over 48,500 jets by 2042, 
with airlines replacing half of the existing fleet with new, fuel-efficient models.  According to senior vice-president of 
commercial sales and marketing Brad McMullen, airlines will be matching the demands of the industry through 
actions such as simplifying their fleets to improve efficiency.  "Looking to the future of air travel, our 2023 CMO 
reflects a further evolution of passenger traffic tied to the global growth of the middle class, investments in 
sustainability, continued growth for low-cost carriers and air cargo demand to serve evolving supply chains and 
express cargo delivery," said McMullen. The growth of the global fleet will largely be driven by single-aisle 
aeroplanes as they will account for 75% of all new deliveries according to the company's research, with widebody 
jets making up a further 20%.  Alongside global growth, Boeing's report also looked at regional trends to discover 
that the Asia-Pacific market will continue to grow and eventually account for 40% of the global demand for aircraft, 
with China making up half of that percentage.  The demand from China matches a projected rise in air travel for the 
country as intra-China traffic is expected to finally overtake intra-North American traffic as the most valuable sector 
of the industry by 2042.  Chinese airlines are expected to follow a similar growth, above the global average, 
accounting for 18% of global passenger traffic by the end of the forecast period, up from 15%.  The strong growth 
forecast reflects Boeing's own recent circumstances which have seen a steady flow of orders from airlines around 
the world, including a Ryanair order for at least 150 737 Max 10 jets and an Avolon order for 40 of the same model.  
Alongside looking at commercial operations, the CMO report also includes data on the air cargo and freighter sector 
which has seen strong post-pandemic growth thanks to a geographic diversification of supply chains.  The report 
said: "The focus is evolving from a pre-pandemic emphasis on efficiency and cost to a more nuanced approach that 
balances these factors with the need for reliability and resiliency."

Jun 16, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 The Zacks Airline[1] industry has been benefiting from buoyant air travel demand, following the easing of COVID-
19 travel restrictions and the reopening of the global economy. The industry is witnessing a solid recovery in 
demand for domestic as well as international flights. People are again booking flights, thereby leading to higher 
passenger revenues, which contribute to the bulk of most airlines' top lines. 
Driven by the buoyant scenario with respect to air traffic, Copa Holdings CPA[2], Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes 
GOL[3], Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[4] and Azul AZUL[5] reported impressive traffic numbers for the month of May. 
While CPA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), GOL, RYAAY and AZUL carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) 
each. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.[6] 
Let's take an in-depth look at these companies' May traffic reports.

reports of the above carriers highlight the positivity surrounding the industry. We believe that the current summer 
season is likely to see a further surge in passenger revenues, in turn, aiding airlines' top lines. Per Airlines for 
America, U.S. airlines areanticipated[8]to carry 257 million passengers from Jun 1 to Aug 31, 2023. The projection 
marks an all-time high. 
Owing to the uptick in passenger volumes coupled with the decline in fuel costs the International Air Transport 
Association or IATA doubled[9] its current-year forecast for net profits. Despite economic uncertainties. Passenger 
revenues are the biggest driver of the rosy projection for 2023. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 are now 
anticipated to be $546 billion compared with the previous estimate of $522 billion. The revised revenue forecast 
indicates a 27% increase from the 2022 actuals.

Ryanair's Chief Pilot was dismissed following an internal investigation at the airline.
The airline's Chief People Officer (CPO) Darrell Hughes shared an internal note to employees on June 14, 2023, 
saying that the internal investigation found the chief pilot had a "pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable 
behaviour towards a number of female junior pilots," according to a report by the Irish business news portal The 
Currency.
The Irish outlet reported that Ryanair began investigating the manner three weeks ago after one of its employees 
sent a note to the organization. Furthermore, the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) was reportedly aware of 
the situation and is currently actively talking with its union members within the airline.
Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the Chief Pilot was dismissed with immediate effect on June 13, 2023, with the 
airline letting go of the employee since he worked with Ryanair since 2020.
"We do not comment on queries relating to individual employees," said a Ryanair spokesperson in a statement to 
aerotime.aero.

Airbus and Boeing Experience Mixed Fortunes in May 2023 Aircraft Orders and Deliveries

In May 2023, both Airbus and Boeing had noteworthy developments in their aircraft orders and deliveries, each 
claiming a successful month.
Airbus' Delivery Recovery: During the month, Airbus demonstrated signs of recovery in its supply chain by 
delivering a total of 63 aircraft, the highest number achieved so far in 2023.
The Airbus A320neo family, particularly the A320neo and A321neo models, dominated deliveries with 19 and 32 
aircraft, respectively. Additionally, three Airbus A220s were delivered to airBaltic, Air France, and Breeze Airways, 
along with three A330-900neos, including ITA Airways' first wide-body of this type, leased via Aircraft Lease 
Corporation (ALC).
Furthermore, Airbus handed over one A330 MRTT tanker to the United Arab Emirates Air Force (UAEAF). The 
manufacturer also successfully delivered three A350-900 and two Airbus A350-1000s, including one A350-1000 to 
Qatar Airways. Notably, the A350 orders were reinstated after Airbus and Qatar Airways resolved their dispute 
regarding the early degradation of the aircraft's paint surface through an out-of-court settlement in February 2023.
However, Airbus received only 17 new orders during the month. These orders included 16 A320neo aircraft, nine of 
which were from an undisclosed customer, and one A330-900neo from another undisclosed customer. While year-
to-date net orders stand at 144 aircraft after cancellations, the record-breaking number of deliveries in May signals 
a potential improvement in Airbus' supply chain. The company expects the situation to further improve in the 
second half of the year, with a backloaded delivery schedule of 720 aircraft expected for 2023. As of May 2023, 
Airbus has delivered a total of 244 aircraft year-to-date.
Boeing Remains Commercially Competitive: Despite facing manufacturing challenges that temporarily slowed 
deliveries in 2023, including issues with the 737 MAX, 767, and 787 models, Boeing managed to maintain 
competitiveness in terms of year-to-date deliveries, trailing slightly behind Airbus.
In May 2023, Boeing delivered a total of 50 aircraft, with 35 of them being the 737 MAX. Notable customers 
receiving these deliveries were Southwest Airlines, Ryanair, and United Airlines, each taking six, 11, and six 
aircraft, respectively. Additionally, the South Korean military received the P8 Poseidon, a narrow-body aircraft 
based on the 737 NG.
Airbus and Boeing Experience Mixed Fortunes in May 2023 Aircraft Orders and Deliveries
On the wide-body aircraft front, airlines received eight 787s, three 767Fs, and three 777Fs. Boeing also delivered 
two 787-9s to lessors, specifically AerCap and ALC. These two aircraft are likely HL8389, registered with South 
Korea's Air Premia, and ET-AYD, currently flying with Ethiopian Airlines.
In terms of orders, Boeing secured significant deals in May 2023, including a substantial 59-aircraft order for the 
737 MAX from an unidentified customer. Additionally, another unidentified customer purchased eight Boeing 787-
9s, and Papua New Guinea's Air Niugini committed to acquiring two Boeing 787s.
Overall, Boeing has booked orders for 223 aircraft year-to-date, compared to Airbus' 144 orders as of May 2023. 
Despite challenges, Boeing's commercial success remains strong.

Ryanair sacking Chief pilot dismissed after female staff report 'unacceptable behaviour'

Ryanair has dismissed the chief pilot of its main Irish-registered operations after an investigation uncovered a 
"pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour" towards junior female pilots at the company.
A senior company insider said a note had been emailed to employees of Ryanair DAC, which operates the carrier's 
Irish-registered aircraft, informing them that its chief pilot had been dismissed on Tuesday evening.
The note, reviewed by the Financial Times, was signed by Ryanair's chief people officer Darrell Hughes and did not 
name the person dismissed.
Ryanair DAC's chief pilot for the past three years has been Aidan Murray. Murray could not immediately be reached 
for comment.
"The decision follows an investigation over recent days which identified a pattern of repeated inappropriate and 
unacceptable behaviour towards a number of junior female pilots, in breach of our harassment policy," the note 
read. "We are determined to ensure all of our people come to work in a safe and secure environment."
It asked recipients to respect the privacy of the "brave women who came forward to assist us in this investigation". 
An airline's chief pilot flies relatively rarely and oversees the application of new safety rules, promotions and other 
organisational issues.

The Ryanair insider, who has direct knowledge of the investigation, said it had been prompted by an anonymous 
tip-off and that the company had discovered the chief pilot sent inappropriately sexualised text messages to seven 
junior female pilots aged between 21 and 32. Some had been asked to send him explicit pictures of themselves, 
while several had their rosters altered so that they would fly with him.
About 40 per cent of Ryanair's operations - including all the operations of aircraft based in Ireland, the UK, Spain 
and Portugal - use aircraft belonging to Ryanair DAC.
There have been no arrests or allegations of criminal wrongdoing in the case.
Ryanair said it did not comment on queries relating to individual employees. The insider said the company had 
checked with the women concerned whether they had received similar approaches from other senior male staff and 
none had reported any such issues.
The chief pilot has seven days following Tuesday's dismissal to mount an appeal.
The Irish Aviation Authority said it did not comment on correspondence with "regulated entities".

"pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour" towards junior female pilots at the company.
A senior company insider said a note had been emailed to employees of Ryanair DAC, which operates the carrier's 
Irish-registered aircraft, informing them that its chief pilot had been dismissed on Tuesday evening.
The note, reviewed by the Financial Times, was signed by Ryanair's chief people officer Darrell Hughes and did not 
name the person dismissed.
Ryanair DAC's chief pilot for the past three years has been Aidan Murray. Murray could not immediately be reached 
for comment.
"The decision follows an investigation over recent days which identified a pattern of repeated inappropriate and 
unacceptable behaviour towards a number of junior female pilots, in breach of our harassment policy," the note 
read. "We are determined to ensure all of our people come to work in a safe and secure environment."
It asked recipients to respect the privacy of the "brave women who came forward to assist us in this investigation". 
An airline's chief pilot flies relatively rarely and oversees the application of new safety rules, promotions and other 
organisational issues.
Ryanair sacking Chief pilot dismissed after female staff report 'unacceptable behaviour'
The Ryanair insider, who has direct knowledge of the investigation, said it had been prompted by an anonymous 
tip-off and that the company had discovered the chief pilot sent inappropriately sexualised text messages to seven 
junior female pilots aged between 21 and 32. Some had been asked to send him explicit pictures of themselves, 
while several had their rosters altered so that they would fly with him.
About 40 per cent of Ryanair's operations - including all the operations of aircraft based in Ireland, the UK, Spain 
and Portugal - use aircraft belonging to Ryanair DAC.
There have been no arrests or allegations of criminal wrongdoing in the case.
Ryanair said it did not comment on queries relating to individual employees. The insider said the company had 
checked with the women concerned whether they had received similar approaches from other senior male staff and 
none had reported any such issues.
The chief pilot has seven days following Tuesday's dismissal to mount an appeal.
The Irish Aviation Authority said it did not comment on correspondence with "regulated entities".

Causeway Capital Management, the Los Angeles-based firm founded by
Sarah Ketterer  ( Trades , Portfolio ) and Harry Hartford in 2001, seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by 
investing in mispriced equities in both developed as well as emerging markets.
Implementing quantitative and value-oriented methods, the guru and her team look for potential investment 
opportunities among mid- and large-cap companies. Each stock also receives a risk score based on the additional 
volatility or risk it adds to the portfolio. The investment team then enters positions in the stocks with the highest 
expected risk-adjusted return that also have a lower price-earnings ratio and higher dividend yield than the market.
As of the end of the first quarter, the industrial sector had the largest representation in Ketterer's $4.17 billion 13F 
equity portfolio with a weight of 36.33%.
Further, the industrials space may offer good value opportunities currently as the sector has gained 10.83% year to 
date.
According to GuruFocus portfolio data , Ketterer's industrials holdings as of the three months ended March 31 were 
Ryanair Holdings PLC (
RYAAY ,  Financial ), Canadian National Railway Co. (  CNI  ,  Financial ), RELX PLC (  RELX  ,  Financial ) and 
Carrier Global Corp. (  CARR  ,  Financial ).
Investors should be aware 13F filings do not give a complete picture of a firm's holdings as the reports only include 
its positions in U.S. stocks and American depository receipts, but they can still provide valuable information.

Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) has its eye on the slots that IAG International Airlines Group is likely to be 
compelled to dispose of if the group's planned acquisition of Air Europa (UX, Palma de Mallorca) is to be approved 
by the European Commission, the business newspaper Cinco Dias reported on June 12.
The budget carrier is closely following the integration process involving Air Europa and IAG's Iberia (IB, Madrid 
Barajas), its communications manager for Spain and Portugal, Elena Cabrera, told the daily - as much for the 
assets it will have to let go of as for the combination of two competitors.
"It seems to us to be an operation that makes perfect sense. In Europe there are too many companies, and 
mergers fall within the logic of the market. We are following the process because we are interested in the possible 
release of slots at different airports," she said.
"Slots would fit us both in the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, and here in Madrid, but in reality we are 
open to any opportunity that arises because we are in a growth phase in Spain," she added.
The Irish airline will fight for "an objective distribution" if the possibility arises that the Spanish flag carrier tries to get 
the deal cleared by proposing which parts of the business and to which companies it carries out its concessions. In 
the first attempt to buy Air Europa, in early 2020, Iberia proposed that Volotea (V7, Asturias) take over select slots 
and routes to and from Spain in the short-haul market and World2Fly (Spain) (2W, Palma de Mallorca) in the long 
haul. This did not impress the antitrust regulator in Brussels, however.
Cabrera explained that Ryanair would try to ensure Iberia is not "the one that decides who delivers the production, 
because the normal thing is that someone is chosen who does not represent real competition."

demand. Driven by high passenger volumes, revenue passenger miles (a measure of traffic) rose in double digits in

To match the demand swell, CPA is increasing its capacity to meet the rising demand. In May, available seat miles 
(a measure of capacity) increased 15.3% year over year. Revenue passenger miles increased 15.8%. With traffic 
growth outpacing capacity expansion, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) improved to 86.1%

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has expressed interest in purchasing Spanish airport slots owned by 
International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG).
Ahead of the British Airways owner's plan to buy out the remaining 80% of Spanish carrier Air Europa, IAG may 
have to give up slots at several Spanish airports to get the deal approved, according to reports.
"We are interested in the possible liberation of slots in different airports," Ryanair communication manager Elena 
Cabrera told local newspaper Cinco Dias on Monday.
"We are following the process," she confirmed, adding the Irish airline was eyeing slots in Madrid, as well as the 
Canary and Balearic Islands.
IAG agreed to buy the remaining 80% of Air Europa shares which it does not own in February for (EURO)400mln 
(£344mln), but is waiting on anti-trust clearance by the European Commission.
"The truth is that we are open to any opportunity as we are in growth phase in Spain," Cabrera added.
Ryanair shares were trading 0.2% higher on Tuesday at (EURO)16.92.

It's A sense of freedom you don't get with other holidays." Jay from The Inbetweeners might have been prone to 
wishful thinking ("the first rule of Caravan Club is that everyone gets some") or even outright lies ("the Camber 
Sands meeting is always like a massive orgy"), but he clearly enjoyed a traditional British getaway.
Me? I still felt scarred by memories of a week in Wales, huddled with my parents in a cold caravan while the rain 
drummed endlessly on the roof. It was, well, a sense of freezing you don't get with other holidays. Thankfully, this 
time would be different.
This time, we were headed to New Forest and the forecast was wall-to-wall sunshine. And this time, instead of a 
flimsy fibreglass box, we had a Volkswagen Grand California. With central heating, a bathroom, kitchen facilities 
and dimmable ambient lighting, this fully-kitted camper is like a hip studio apartment on wheels. "You kids don't 
know you're born," I may have muttered, as the Pitts piled aboard.
In two-tone red and white, the Grand California 600 channels the spirit of the classic VW Microbus. Or maybe it just 
looks like an ice cream van, I can't decide. The cabin sleeps four, with one double bed at the back and another in 
the hightop roof above the driver and front passenger. It's beautifully built, with loads of clever storage and a huge 
800-litre 'garage' for your luggage. You could pack the kitchen sink, if it didn't already have one.
Volkswagen doesn't quote a 0-62mph time for the Grand California, but be assured that nothing happens in a hurry. 
Its gruff 177hp 2.0-litre diesel engine sounds pretty 'light commercial', too. Nonetheless, a high driving position, tight

turning circle and big mirrors, plus an array of sensors and cameras, all make for comfortable, stress-free progress. 
You can't say that about a Ryanair flight to the Med.
The New Forest is teeming with Volkswagen campers: mostly recent T4 and T5 models, many of them customised 
with airbrushed paint and alloy wheels. Our flagship T6 Grand California turns plenty of heads and, sure enough, 
I'm soon approached by a fellow dad ("Oooh, van friend!") who asks for a guided tour.
Nosey neighbours aside, getting settled in the Grand California couldn't be easier. You simply park up, plug in and 
un- pack the custom-fit table and chairs. Oh, and light the barbecue. On a balmy summer evening, it really does feel 
idyllic.
Everyone gets a solid night's sleep, too. The mattresses are only 80mm thick, but the springs underneath add some 
extra squidge. The upper bed is really for children only, but our two (aged nine and 12) had no complaints. And 
while tentdwellers were roused at dawn by bright sunshine and stifling humidity, we managed a quiet, climate-
controlled lie-in.
Some downsides of being a "bus w**ker" become apparent the next day, starting with a cramped shower, then 
emptying the toilet waste: not a task I'd recommend after breakfast. We then realise that driving anywhere means 
clearing the kitchen, folding away the top bunk and stashing everything in the cupboards again. It's certainly not as 
spontaneous as simply unhitching a caravan and jumping in your car.
At nearly three metres, the Grand California also proves too tall for many beachside car parks along this stretch of 
the south coast. However, once I do find a spot, it quickly redeems itself with a fridge/freezer full of cold beers for 
the grown-ups and rocket lollies for the kids. By the time we return to the campsite, sunburned and full of sand, I'm 
being nagged to buy one.
Even at £80,666, the big VW is cheaper than a beach hut near Bournemouth. Nonetheless, there's no denying it's a 
major investment, particularly when the regular California camper costs from £20,000 less. Many purpose-built 
motorhomes also look better value, but none offer the same quality or campsite kudos. Maybe Jay got it right this 
time. Camber Sands next summer?. Tim Pitt writes for www.motoringresearch.com

Notes: 
At current rates, Boeing might not deliver much more than it did last year. The Paris show is undoubtedly going to 
produce some juicy orders. Same for Airbus and Embraer[1]. Among 2023 YTD deliveries, 48% have gone to three 
customers: Southwest, United, and Ryanair (in that order) Over 55% of Boeing's YTD deliveries are in North 
America.

Spanish OTAs lose Ryanair ruling appeal

A Spanish court has rejected an appeal by the country's travel agency association (Asociación Corporativa de 
Agencias de Viajes Especializadas - ACAVE) against Ryanair (FR, Dublin International) in connection with criminal 
charges Spanish travel agents laid against the budget carrier in 2021 for tarnishing their reputation.
The Barcelona Appeal Court affirmed a court of first instance decision in April that rejected the ACAVE lawsuit 
against Ryanair.
According to a statement issued by the airline, the appeal court found that Ryanair's statements on online travel 
agents' (OTA) "damaging practices are true and supported by extensive documentary evidence". "Specifically, the 
courts found that it is standard practice for OTAs to overcharge customers by applying 'service charges and that 
some OTAs frustrate Ryanair's direct communications with customers and block refund payments by not providing 
Ryanair with the customer's correct details," the airline said.
In its 2021 lawsuit, ACAVE said Ryanair accused its members of obstructing Ryanair's refunds to customers or 
providing false information to clients on reservation payments. Ryanair said OTAs have no commercial agreements 
with Ryanair and are not authorised to sell its flights. It accused agents of selling its tickets through "screen 
scraping". This consists of an agent buying an online airline ticket on behalf of a client and charging a service fee.
Meanwhile, Reuters reports that Ryanair's parent, Ryanair Holdings, and Chief Executive Michael O'Leary reached 
a cash settlement of USD5 million with a pension fund on June 7 in the US District Court in Manhattan following 
mediation. In 2018, the Alabama-based City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension 
System led a class action suit against Ryanair and O'Leary, claiming they had made false and misleading 
statements to shareholders regarding employment issues at the airline - allegations that were strenuously denied. 
After Ryanair recognised pilot unions in December 2017 to avert a strike, unionisation increased costs, resulting in 
lower profits at Ryanair, wiping out "millions" in shareholder value, they claimed. Cited, amongst others, was

Amadeus invests into SAF with minority Caphenia stake
Amadeus invests into SAF with minority Caphenia stake

Highlight: Travel technology company Amadeus has made its first investment outside of the software world with its 
acquisition of a minority stake in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) company Caphenia.
Body
The German organisation is developing a way of producing synthesis gas - a feedstock of SAF, using a mixture of 
biogas, CO2, water and electricity.  Amadeus head of ventures Suzanna Chiu said: "The transaction represents a 
step forward in our sustainability strategy, taking the perspective from a different part of the value chain in the 
industry.  "As the industry moves toward its goal of reaching net zero by 2050, we are taking concrete steps to 
accelerate the process."  Whilst Caphenia has secured patent protection for its Power-and-Biogas-to-Liquid 
process, the company has yet to start production but has plans to begin next year.  Caphenia's plans have forecast 
that the company will be producing 10 million litres of SAF by 2027, 100 million litres by 2030 and over one billion 
by 2035.  Caphenia chief executive Dr Mark Misselhorn highlighted SAF as a "practical long-term alternative" to 
current fuels due to the up to 92% reduction in CO2 emissions that it brings.  Misselhorn said: "Our process is 
affordable - using one-sixth of the electricity needed for alternative SAF production methods - and scalable.  "We 
have the ambition to offer large-scale production by 2028, aiming to fill the gap between anticipated SAF demand 
and current supply."  Amadeus isn't the only company to be investing in SAF recently with major players including 
Qantas, Boeing and Ryanair also putting significant funding into the research and use of SAF technology.  
However, whilst SAF has been declared a crucial part of the aviation industry's sustainability and decarbonisation 
drive, some in the industry have dampened the hopes that it may one day replace traditional fuels with Boeing CEO 
Dave Calhoun saying it will never be as affordable.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) is interested in buying International Consolidated Airlines Group's (IAG.L) slots in certain airports 
in the event that antitrust regulators require their sale to clear the latter's pending Air Europa takeover, Spanish 
newspaper Cinco Dias reported Monday.
The Irish budget airline's Spanish communications manager Elena Cabrera said Ryanair is eyeing IAG's slots in the 
Canary and Balearic Islands, as well as in Madrid, though she added that the company is "open to any 
opportunities." The possible transaction is in line with the Dublin-listed air carrier's growth strategy in Spain.
IAG's acquisition of the remaining 80% stake in Spain's Air Europa for 400 million euros is still pending the 
European Commission's approval.
Ryanair and IAG gained 1% in recent trade.

Low-cost European carrier Wizz Air expects to return to profit this year as the post-pandemic rebound in travel 
gathers pace and the group puts a series of setbacks behind it.
The airline's expectations of making a profit in the year to March 2024 contrast with the previous financial year, 
when it faced several problems, including a decision to abandon fuel hedges that backfired when the war in Ukraine 
sent prices up sharply.
The fuel price exposure was a substantial contributor to the carrier's net loss for the year to March 31 of 
(EURO)535mn.
With comprehensive currency and fuel hedges now in place, the Budapestbased group said yesterday that it 
expected to report a net profit for the current financial year of between (EURO)350mn and (EURO)450mn.
Wizz Air has expanded aggressively since it was founded almost 20 years ago, making it a competitor to Ryanair in 
Europe's low-cost market.
Referring to the lack of hedging, chief executive József Váradi said its fuel costs in the first half of its last financial 
year had been "totally down to the market" and that the market "was not paying a favour to us".
He attributed the expected turnround from the (EURO)535mn loss to profits of (EURO)350mn to (EURO)450mn to 
three factors.
Wizz Air expects return to profit this year Airlines
Váradi said that of the roughly (EURO)1bn improvement, he expected cost efficiencies to generate (EURO)400mn, 
a further (EURO)200mn to come from better use of the airline's fleet and crew and about (EURO)400mn from 
having fuel and currency hedges in place.
The company is targeting expansion to Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates and other parts of Asia, as 
well as growth in western Europe.
Wizz Air shares have soared almost 50 per cent this year, cutting some of the steep decline that began in early 
2021, as investors anticipate further improvements in the carrier's performance.
For the 12 months to March 2023, Wizz Air's revenues more than doubled to (EURO)3.9bn as passenger demand 
recovered from the pandemic. Yesterday, the company said it expected to increase its available seat capacity by 
about 30 per cent in the current financial year.
"I think that we're clearly seeing very strong demand for our services and products," Váradi said.

Jun 09, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, European carrier Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] and Latin Americas' Gol Linhas' GOL[2] reported 
May traffic. The numbers were aided by an upbeat scenario with respect to air travel demand. Also, owing to the 
buoyant air travel demand scenario, International Air Transport Association or IATA doubled [3]its 2023 net profit 
projection for airlines across the globe. 
American Airlines AAL[4] was another news-maker courtesy of management's decision to introduce an additional 
bag fee on transpacific flights. JetBlue Airways JBLU[5] made an expansion-related update in the past week. Recap 
of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. In May, 17 million passengers availed Ryanair flights. This compared 
favorably with the April figure of 16 million and the May 2022 figure of 15.4 million. Owing to upbeat traffic, load 
factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 94% in May compared with 92% a year ago. 
RYAAY, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), operated more than 94,400[6] flights in May.You can seethe 
complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]. 
AAL was also in the news recently, courtesy of management's decision to lift the second-quarter 2023 earnings per 
share forecast.That update was covered in detail in our previous week's write-up[8]. 
2. In May, consolidated revenue passenger kilometers (a measure of air traffic) and available seat kilometers (a 
measure of capacity) increased 13.1% and 14.9%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Load factor was 76.1%. 
The number of flight departures at GOL in May registered a 20.7% year-over-year increase. 
Domestic departures, accounting for more than 95% of total departures during the month, grew 19.3% on a year-
over-year basis. On the domestic front, the number of seats increased 19.5% in May. International departures 
surged 66.9% in May on a year-over-year basis. The consolidated passenger on board metric rose 20.1% year over 
year. 
3. Owing to the buoyant air travel demand scenario, IATA now expects the industry to generate a net profit of $9.8 
billion in 2023 compared with $4.7 billion estimated in December last year. The top line in 2023 is now anticipated 
to be $803 billion compared with the previous estimate of $779 billion. The revised revenue forecast indicates a 
9.7% increase from the 2022 actuals. In the event of the revenue forecast coming true, 2023 would be the first year 
Airline Stock Roundup: IATA's Bullish Forecast for 2023 Profit, GOL, RYAAY in Focus
since 2019 (pre-pandemic) when total revenues for airlines across the globe would exceed $800 billion. Notably, 
revenues were $838 billion in 2019. 
Passenger revenues are the biggest driver of the rosy projection for 2023. Per IATA, passenger revenues in 2023 
are now anticipated to be $546 billion compared with the previous estimate of $522 billion. The revised revenue 
forecast indicates[9] a 27% increase from the 2022 actuals. 
4. American Airlines has decided to charge $75 for the first checked bag for passengers who booked the cheapest 
tickets (Basic Economy) on several long-distance flights, including those flying to Israel, Australia and India, among 
others. Passengers will be charged $100 for the second bag, $200 for the third bag and so on. This change has 
come into effect from Jun 7. 
5 JetBlue has decided to serve two more destinations, Belize and St. Kitts, as part of the attempt to expand its 
network in the Caribbean. JetBlue will offer nonstop flights (thrice a week: Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays) from 
New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Robert Llewellyn Bradshaw International Airport in St. 
Kitts from Nov 2. Non-stop flights from JFK to Belize City will take to the skies (on Mondays, Wednesdays, and 
Saturdays) from Dec 6. Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players 
over the past week and during the last six months.

The table above shows that all airline stocks traded in the green over the past week, resulting in the NYSE ARCA 
Airline Index gaining 4.2% to $69.37. Over the course of the past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has 
appreciated 17.4%. What's Next in the Airline Space? Stay tuned for the usual news updates in the space.

Wizz Air over 'turbulent times,' acquisitions maybe next - analysts

Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) is finally on course to overcome a "turbulent" few years following the pandemic, 
brokers hailed following the company's full-year results release.
Wizz Air forecast a net profit of between (EURO)350mln and (EURO)450mln in 2024, having delivered an expected 
reported loss of (EURO)535.1mln in the 12 months to March.
Analysts were widely convinced by Wizz's optimism too, largely agreeing that the FTSE 250-listed airline's risky 
move of bolstering the size of its fleet looked set to pay off.
"Wizz Air is one of the most ambitious airlines operating today," AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould said.
"There is a lingering feeling that Wizz Air is still aiming for the stars [...] that means acquisitions could be on the 
agenda".
Though Airbus Group (EPA:AIR)'s ability to deliver Wizz's 42 new A321neo jets will have an effect, stronger 
passenger figures amid recovering post-pandemic demand mean the airline is "well on the way" to profitability, 
Third Bridge analyst Olly Anibaba noted.
Ongoing cost pressures and whether Wizz manages to cope with the ramped-up capacity being offered are other 
issues the budget airline could face, according to analysts.
"It [is] vital that Wizz Air gets bums on seats to ensure its load factor doesn't suffer," City Index's Joshua Warner 
commented.
Wizz Air over 'turbulent times,' acquisitions maybe next - analysts
Wizz's growth plan of "aggressively" expanding while rivals including easyJet PLC and Ryanair Holdings PLC 
(LSE:RYA) focus on recovering from the effects of the pandemic as quickly as possible will likely convince 
investors, Mould added.
"So, it might have enough support to raise a significant amount of money to turbocharge that growth through a 
corporate deal," he continued, hinting to future acquisitions.
Wizz Air shares were trading 0.7% higher on Thursday at 2,797p.

Ryanair Reaches $5 Million Settlement in Shareholder Dispute Over Pilot Unions

Ryanair has reached a $5 million settlement with its shareholders who alleged that they were deceived by the 
carrier's comments about its willingness to recognize unions.
The settlement was agreed between both parties, putting the United States (US) Class Action lawsuit, launched by 
the City of Birmingham Pension Fund in 2018, to rest.
Following mediation between Ryanair and the pension fund, the airline said it has agreed to pay the latter $5 
million, after a US District Court judge "dismissed many of the claims made by the plaintiff, considerably narrowing 
the grounds for action" in 2020.
"The total settlement amount is $5m, which is considerably less than the legal costs that would have been incurred 
had this action gone all the way to trial," read a statement by the airline, attributed to a spokesperson and issued on 
June 7, 2023.
"Ryanair contends there was no lawful basis for this claim, but that the settlement is in the interest of all 
shareholders due to the very modest settlement amount. The final settlement agreement will be subject to approval 
by the Court," the statement added.
Michael O'Leary, chief executive officer (CEO) of Ryanair, famously said that "hell would freeze over" before the 
carrier would have unions. Three months later, in December 2017, Ryanair recognized unions at the airline, 
averting a strike.
The unions still began industrial action in the summer of 2018, with several one-day strikes occurring in July 2018, 
which were organized by the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA). A month later, IALPA was joined by pilots in 
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden, resulting in 400 canceled flights over a period of 24 hours.
In December 2022, the United Kingdom (UK) Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) reached a settlement with Ryanair, 
allowing passengers to claim compensation for the flight disruptions. Previously, the airline tried to argue that the 
strike was an extraordinary circumstance which, under the European Commission's (EC) regulations, would have 
allowed Ryanair not to compensate passengers.

(Alliance News) - Ryanair Holdings PLC said on Thursday that the US class action lawsuit launched in November 
2018 by the City of Birmingham pension fund in Alabama has been settled. 
The Dublin-based budget airline has reached a USD5.0 million settlement of a lawsuit that accused them of 
defrauding shareholders by downplaying its willingness to recognise labour unions. 
The case was launched by the City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System: an 
Alabama pension fund. 
Shareholders accused Ryanair and Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary of inflating the company's stock price 
by attempting to mislead them into believing they would not welcome unions. 
The lawsuit cited CEO O'Leary's claim that hell would "freeze over" before Ryan accepted unions.
Shareholders also mentioned the company's claim that it had enough pilots when it actually had a pilot shortage. 
The company offered to recognise pilot unions to avert a strike in December 2017. 
After recent mediation between the parties, the lawsuit was settled.
This settlement followed the US District Court dismissal of several claims made by the plaintiff in 2020. This 
dismissal narrowed grounds for action.
Ryanair says that the finalised settlement agreement is subject to approval by the court. 
The company states that there was no lawful basis for this claim, but that the settlement is in the interest of all 
shareholders due to the modest settlement amount. 
Shares in Ryanair Holdings were up 1.0% at EUR16.92 in Dublin on Thursday.

Airlines, takeaway firms and hospitality groups can take some crumbs of comfort from Barclaycard's latest monthly 
spending data, according to analysis from US bank Jefferies.
On the surface the numbers reflect the effect of higher inflation, overall spending in May was up by 3.6% year-on-
year, down from 4.23% in the month previously and the lowest rate of increase since October last year.
Spending classified as 'essential' rose by 4.9% fuelled by an 8.9% rise in the use of credit cards for buying 
groceries, which again was higher than spending classified as non-essential.
Jefferies though points out that times might be tough but Brits love of takeaways, foreign travel and going out is a 
hard habit to break.
Non-essential spending rose by in 3.0% in May but was much stronger in the "Travel' categories, with 'Travel' 
'Travel Agents' and 'Airlines', up +13.6%, +9.9%, and +34.4% respectively versus a year earlier.
Compared to the period prior to the pandemic, (Apr'23 vs Apr'19), the numbers are even larger.
Takeaways and Fast Food (+103%) have seen the strongest non-essential growth followed by Digital Content & 
Subscription (+65%); Bars, Pubs & Clubs (+58%) and travel +13%, travel agents+14%, and airlines +14%.
Good news for Sky, one of the main reasons for the growth in digital content spending is the success of its series 
Succession.
Air travel and streaming dominate credit card spending but groceries climbing fast
Airlines, meanwhile, have been reporting a surge in passenger numbers for some time.
WizzAir will be the latest to update when it reports annual results tomorrow.
Shares in British Airways owner IAG were 157p today, up 27% over six months, while over the same period

French anti-pension reform protesters stormed the headquarters of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games on Tuesday as 
trade unions made a last-gasp attempt to pressure lawmakers into reversing President Emmanuel Macron's raising 
of the retirement age.
BFM television broadcast images of several dozen hardleft CGT trade union militants briefly occupying the building 
in Aubervilliers, northern Paris, as marches got under way in towns and cities across France.
"There was no violence and no damage," a Games spokesperson told Reuters.
Trade unions have fought Macron's move to make the French work longer since mid-January, with rolling strikes 
and protests that have at times descended into violence on the fringes.
Macron says it was necessary to lift the legal retirement age by two years to 64 to plug a widening pension deficit. 
However, trade unions say the money can be found elsewhere, such as by taxing the wealthy more.
The new pension law is already on the statute books and after months of rare unity among the biggest trade unions, 
there are now divisions over where to focus energies.
"This will be the last protest of this kind over the pension matter," Lauren Berger, head of the reform-minded CFDT 
trade union, said ahead of the protest in Paris.
Sophie Binet, leader of the CGT, said her union would battle on. Even so, she acknowledged that turnout was set to 
fall on previous rounds.
"There's a lot of anger but also fatigue," Binet said, adding that strikers had felt the pinch on their wallets.
'BALANCE OF POWER'
French Pension Plan Protesters Briefly Storm Summer Olympics HQ
Between 400,000 and 600,000 people were expected to join the protests, authorities said, which would be down 
from more than a million who took part at the height of the pension protests earlier this year.
Some protesters have threatened to disrupt next summer's Olympics if Macron does not back down. Banners 
reading "No retirement, No Olympics" were visible in Paris.
Some 11,000 police were deployed, including 4,000 in Paris, on Tuesday. Fuel deliveries were blocked from leaving 
TotalEnergies' Donges site, near Nantes in western France where riot police clashed with black-clad protesters.
Disruption to rail travel was light. The civil aviation authority asked airlines to cancel a third of flights out of Paris-
Orly, the capital's number two airport, and a walk out by some air traffic control staff forced some overflight 
cancellations.
"Again today we've had to cancel some 400 flights ... because of French ATC strikes. The majority of these flights 
are overflights and not going to France," Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary tweeted.
Macron and his government have been on a blitz in past weeks to shift the narrative. The French leader has 
unveiled electric vehicle battery investments, tax credits for green industry and tax cuts for the middle classes.
Berger said the CFDT's aim was now to turn anger into a "show of strength" in talks with the government on issues 
such as improving work conditions to purchasing power.
On Thursday, an opposition-sponsored motion aimed at cancelling the minimum pension age increase will be 
reviewed by parliament.
It is expected to be rejected by the lower house's speaker, a member of Macron's party, because under the 
constitution, lawmakers cannot pass legislation that weighs on public finances without measures to offset those 
costs.
But unions hope a big protest turnout could pressure lawmakers into holding a vote and set the stage for further 
challenges.
"We need to prepare for what's to come (after the summer)," said 60-year-old sewer works engineer Jean-Luc 
Carbonari. "We need to reverse the political balance of power."

So is it up, up and away for the aviation industry? It certainly looks that way, at least for some carriers. You can't 
help but note the confidence dripping off market updates from low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Easyjet, who right 
now sit in the sweet spot of a costconscious economy combined with a still-evident post-pandemic desire to get 
away on a regular basis.
The more interesting question for other players in the market is whether the business travel market ever reaches 
the heights it did prepandemic. Signs are that it may not; yesterday, American Airlines' chief commercial officer 
Vasu Raja told the
Wall Street Journal it was 'rethinking' its sweetheart deals with corporations. A report from Deloitte Insights said 
there was a "limited upside" for businesses relying on business travel. What might that mean for carriers? Well, 
there will certainly be a short-term shift to leisure routes. But if long-haul profitability, often driven by tired, slightly 
grumpy and paid-onexpenses business travellers doesn't come back, there may still be some turbulence ahead. AS

RYANAIR has hit out at EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for "ignoring" over 1m passengers who 
called for the protection of overflights during ongoing strikes action.
The budget airline said it is "utterly unacceptable" that von der Leyen is "ignoring these more than 1.1m 
passengers.
It comes as French ATC operators stage fresh walk outs today and tomorrow in an ongoing dispute over pension 
reforms.
The carrier asked the commission to protect all overflights during the strikes, require a 72-hour notice of employee 
participation and a 21-day notice period for industrial action.
France currently protects a number of domestic and short-haul flights through minimum service rules, while some 
other European countries instead protect overflights during strikes. Ryanair argue "this is unfair."
Ryanair's statement said that there had been 58 days of ATC strike action over the past five months in France, and 
that this was over 11 times higher than 2022.
The airline officially submitted its petition to von der Leyen last week.
A spokesperson from the EU commission said: "the Commission has taken note of the petition launched by Ryanair 
to protect overflights in the event of strikes."

Airlines are set to significantly close the gap to pre-pandemic passenger figures this year, with global net sector 
profits now forecast to hit US$9.8bn, up from US$4.7bn originally.
According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global passenger numbers should hit 4.35bn in 
2023, just 4% off the 4.54bn recorded in the year before Covid-19 hit.
As a result, operating profits of US$22.4bn could dwarf the trade body's December estimate of US$3.2bn, the group 
unveiled at an annual meeting, translating to a margin of 1.2% - the first positive reading since 2019.
China's easing of Covid restrictions and subsiding fuel prices are key reasons for the dramatic uptick in full-year 
forecasts, IATA director general Willie Walsh explained.
"Airline financial performance in 2023 is beating expectations," he added, "economic uncertainties have not 
dampened the desire to travel".
British Airways owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (LSE:IAG) is among those anticipating a jump 
in earnings for the year, updating in early May that profit should exceed previous guidance of up to (EURO)2.3bn.
Value carrier easyJet PLC forecast an £80mln-plus pre-tax profit for the year in interim results meanwhile, having 
hinted in January that the figure could even outdo market expectations of £126mln.
Rival Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) has already posted a (EURO)1.43bn after-tax profit for 2023, anticipating 
as early as May that the coming 12 months should bring a "modest year-on-year profit increase".
Airlines hone in on pre-pandemic trading as profit forecasts jump
Outside of the UK, Etihad and Emirates have both posted record-breaking profits in the past year, with the former 
scoring US$296mln in the first half and latter reporting US$2.9bn for 2023.
"The return to net profitability [...] is a major achievement," Walsh continued.
"First, it was achieved at a time of significant economic uncertainties. And second, it follows the deepest losses in 
aviation's history," which sat at $183.3bn between 2020 and 2022.
Wizz Air Holdings PLC (AIM:WIZZ) will be the latest London-listed airline to report earnings on Thursday, 8 June, 
having already tipped investors that 2023 will bring a net loss.
However, setting sights on a profitable 2024, Wizz has already anticipated a return to pre-pandemic passenger 
figures this summer, supported by a 22% yearly growth in May.

Jun 05, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported highly impressive traffic numbers for the month of May driven by upbeat air-
travel demand. The number of passengers ferried on RYAAY flights in May was 17 million. This compared favorably 
with the April figure of 16 million and 15.4 million in May 2022. 
Owing to upbeat traffic, load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) was as high as 94% in May compared 
with 92% a year ago. RYAAY operated more than 94,400 flights in May 2023. On the flip side, more than 300 flights 
were cancelled due to Air traffic controllers strikes in May. 
Owing to buoyant air-travel demand, shares of Ryanair have gained 23.6% over the past year against 4% decline of 
the Zacks Airline [2]industry. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
Ryanair expects to cut some flights in July and August due to delivery delays from Boeing. Zacks Rank & Key Picks 
Ryanair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks 
here.[3] 
Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry are Copa Holdings, S.A. CPA[4] 
and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT[5]. 
Copa Holdings, which presently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is aided by improved air-travel demand. We 
are encouraged by the company's initiatives to modernize its fleet. CPA's focus on its cargo segment is also 
impressive. 
For second-quarter and full-year 2023, CPA's earnings are expected to register 765.6% and 75.4% growth, 
respectively, on a year-over-year basis. 
Allegiant, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1, also benefits from buoyant air-travel demand. With air-travel demand 
rising in the United States, operating revenues improved 8.5% year over year in 2022. 
Management expects revenues to remain strong in 2023 as well. In first-quarter 2023, operating revenues 
increased 29.9% on a year-over-year basis. For second-quarter and full-year 2023, ALGT's earnings are estimated 
to rise 364.5% and 192%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.

 Teesside Airport's 2023 summer season is now flying high after the launch of its final route the Greek island of 
Corfu. The packed flight took off on Saturday 3 June, marking the start of the full slate of holiday flights. 
Passengers have been jetting off to holiday hotspots thanks to airline Ryanair, which runs year-round flights to 
Alicante, alongside Faro in Portugal and Majorca, with Corfu their last destination to take off. 
TUI, one of the UK's biggest holiday companies, has also expanded its offering from Teesside this year, with twice-
weekly flights to Majorca thanks to the popularity of the route last year. It is also offering a service to Antalya, 
Turkey, ahead of introducing flights to the country's popular Dalaman destination in 2024. 
Balkan Holidays is also operating its service to Bourgas, Bulgaria, and holidaymakers are going further afield easier 
than ever with KLM's three-times daily service to Amsterdam Schiphol, serving 200 onward global destinations. 
Teesside was named the UK's second most punctual airport in 2022, with delays of just 11 minutes and nearly half 
of all flights taking off early. This was despite seeing the highest passenger numbers since 2011, with more than 
173,000 people passing through the terminal. 
Passengers have recently taken to social media praising the airport for being 'stress free', the 'excellent customer 
service', a 'great start to the holiday' with one commenter even branding it 'the most pleasurable airport I have ever 
experienced'. 
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: 'With the 2023 season now entirely up and running, we're continuing to 
welcome our all-important holidaymakers through the terminal to give them the best possible start to their summer 
breaks. Corfu was very popular last year and passengers are just as excited this summer. 
'We had the best holiday period for years in 2022 and I'm sure, thanks to extra flights to Majorca and thanks to 
scrapping the 100ml liquid limit in security, we'll have just as great a year now. 
'We're not resting on our laurels, though, and we're continuing our talks with established airline partners and 
potential new ones to secure even more routes local people are crying out for. This is all the while ensuring the 
airport goes from strength to strength by working to welcome new businesses on-site, help expand existing firms 
and boost our new cargo facility.'

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) carried 17.0mln passengers in May, a 10% rise from the 154mln it transported a 
year ago.
The Irish carrier reported a 2 percentage point increase in its load factor to 94% from 92%.
The firm said it operated over 94,400 flights in May 2023 but lost over 300 flights due to strike action hitting 
around 54,000 guests.
On a rolling 12-month basis, passenger numbers are 39% higher at 171.9mln with the load factor 10 percentage 
points higher at 94%.
Last week, Ryanair predictedits passenger numbers will almost double in ten years as it swung strongly into profit in 
the financial year just ended.
Revenues at the Irish carrier jumped 124% to (EURO)10.8bn as fares rose compared to a 75% hike in costs, a gap 
that helped after-tax profits to recover to (EURO)1.43bn from Covid-dominated losses of (EURO)355mln the year 
before.

 Hungary's Ryanair (RYA.IR) on Thursday noted the Metropolitan Court of Budapest's annulment of a "politically 
motivated" 763,000-euro fine from August 2022. 
The penalty was imposed by the Hungarian CPA after the budget airline passed the government's excess profit tax 
to passengers. 
"We welcome this ruling by the Hungarian Courts, which properly reflects EU law, which guarantees airlines the 
freedom to set prices and pass on retrospective taxes, even in cases such as this where there was no lawful basis 
for the Hungarian Govt's bogus "excess profits" tax of (EURO)10 per departing passenger, at a time when all EU 
airlines were losing money due to Covid," Chief Legal Officer Juliusz Komorek said in a statement. 
Shares were up 1% in afternoon trading.

(ANSA) - MAY 31 - German carrier Lufthansa's entry into ITA Airways is "part of an inevitable consolidation 
process" and "anyone could manage ITA better than Italian governments", Ryanair CEI Michael O'Leary said on 
Wednesday. Italian governments have "for years proven to be extraordinarily incompetent," the Irish businessman 
told reporters in Brussels. 
Last Friday Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr announced an agreement with the Italian economy ministry to buy a 
41% stake in ITA Airways worth 325 million euros. The acquisition will take the form of a capital increase into the 
company which replaced loss-making former flag-carrier Alitalia in 2021, with the State taking full ownership. Spohr 
said the transaction would be completed by the end of this year. "The future CEO of ITA Airways and one member 
of the board (out of five in total) will be nominated by Lufthansa," he told conference call with analysts. Spohr added 
that ITA had "no relations or problems linked to the old Alitalia" as it has been "completely restructured and 
configured to be a competitive airline from a cost point of view". Lufthansa also said Thursday that it will have an 
option to buy all the rest of ITA's shares at a later date and that the Italian government has committed to a capital 
increase of 250 million euros into ITA as part of the agreement.

 Ryanair (RYA.IR) is poised to enjoy strong cash generation in the next decade, reflecting the airline's long-term 
fleet strategy and passenger growth targets, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a May 26 note.
The analysts consider the budget airline's passenger growth targets for the next two to three years "achievable," 
even without much demand boost, as competitive pressures on its network ease and the broad consolidation in the 
European short-haul sector helps pricing. The air carrier recently ordered 300 Max 10 jets, with delivery set to begin 
in 2027, which will allow unit cost savings on both a fuel and non-fuel cost basis.
Ryanair's average annual capital expenditure is expected at 2.4 billion euros for 2027 to 2034, corresponding to 2.2 
billion euros in average free cash flow. For the near term, the investment bank believes that the group is "well-
prepared" for a potential demand softness in the winter, with net income growth of 9% year over year anticipated in 
2024.
Morgan Stanley raised the stock's price target to 23 euros from 20 euros and named it its top pick.

The emptiest aircraft on which I ever flew was an All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to London in June 2020, 
amid the pandemic. It was a Boeing 777-300 with about 250 passenger seats, of which four were filled: in airline 
lingo, it had a load factor of less than two per cent.
We crossed continents like a ghost flight, the attendants devotedly sticking to their usual in-flight routines and 
walking by the empty rows of seats to confirm that nothing was amiss. Flight ANA-211 was a fragile link between 
Japan and the UK in the days when many passenger flights stopped: I booked at the last minute and the tickets 
were memorably cheap.
Flights are now much fuller, and fares higher. When I returned to Japan earlier this year, direct fares had doubled in 
price and I connected in Hong Kong to economise. The same is true of shorthaul flights as people book up eagerly 
for summer holidays: Ryanair, now Europe's biggest airline, this week reported strong bookings, and easyJet has 
done the same.
With stronger demand and higher jet fuel costs have come stiffer prices. Ryanair carried 16mn passengers in April - 
more than the same month in 2019 - and its aircraft were 94 per cent full. Its fares have risen by 10 per cent on pre- 
Covid levels and the carrier's famous (EURO)9.99 fares (before paying for bags and better seats) are a fading 
memory.
The price of flying will keep rising, even on Ryanair John Gapper All Consuming
Airlines are notoriously cyclical and prone to losing money: the industry collectively lost $138bn in the annus 
horribilis of 2020, when I took the ghost flight to London. Even in good times, margins are tight. Prices have fallen in 
real terms for decades because they keep on buying new aircraft (Ryanair has ordered up to 300 737-Max 10s from 
Boeing) and trying to fill them.
Despite this, I believe the industry's warnings that we will have to pay more to fly. "We are in an entirely different 
world where air fares are rising," one executive told the FT this week. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, 
may keep squeezing rivals with his motto that "lowest cost wins" but it will not feel like that for the customer.
With restrictions lifted, people want to fly again: "Short-haul flying has roared back to life because of pent-up 
demand," says Frankie O'Connell, reader in air transport at the University of Surrey. They must contend with fewer, 
stronger carriers: Ryanair's flights were about 80 per cent full a decade ago, but seats are now scarcer.
Not only can such airlines charge more; they will soon have to. The industry faces a vast technological challenge in 
meeting its self-imposed target of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It is impossible to do so on the 
current flight path, given that aviation accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global emissions, and moving to another 
one will be extremely expensive.
Ryanair exemplifies the traditional approach: keep on growing but try to curb the environmental impact by replacing 
old aircraft with modern twinengined jets that burn less fuel. It promised this week that people switching to its flights 
from other airlines could cut their emissions by up to 50 per cent because of what it dubs its "gamechanger" fleet of 
newer 737s.
Well, up to a point. It is true that such aircraft help by reducing emissions per passenger, but it is slow going. The 
last of Ryanair's new Boeings is due to be delivered in 2033, only 17 years before the net zero target, and efficiency 
can only partly mitigate growth. Some 10bn passenger journeys are expected in 2050, five times the volume of 
2021.
There is little chance of turning to electric or hydrogen-powered aviation soon: Airbus intends to fly a zero-
emissions hydrogen plane by 2035 but it would take (EURO)300bn of investment to build the infrastructure in 
Europe alone, one study found this week. Even then, taxes on jet fuel would be needed to make hydrogen flight 
competitive.
The best medium-term bet is sustainable aviation fuel, made from waste oils, fats and non-food crops. The industry 
is counting on SAF for two-thirds of the contribution to achieving its net zero target. But it will be hard and costly to 
produce enough: Dave Calhoun, Boeing chief executive, warns that biofuels will "never achieve the price of jet fuel".
There is an iron logic to all this: flying is going to be expensive. I regret it, in many ways. Aviation is marvellous for 
taking holidays in interesting places and exploring the world, despite crowded airports and cramped seats. But 
flyers have not borne the full environmental price, even with carbon offsets, so something has to give.
Prices can be powerful, as the growth in flying encouraged by low cost carriers shows. The French government has 
decreed a ban on domestic flights of less than two and half hours between cities well connected by trains. France is 
an outlier but higher fares could have a similar impact elsewhere in squeezing short-haul flight, where there is a 
decent alternative.
For my part, I am going to Amsterdam next week by train. The Dutch government has been blocked by a court from 
curbing flights to Schiphol airport, and it would have been cheaper to fly. One day, it may not be.

can only partly mitigate growth. Some 10bn passenger journeys are expected in 2050, five times the volume of 
2021.
There is little chance of turning to electric or hydrogen-powered aviation soon: Airbus intends to fly a zero-
emissions hydrogen plane by 2035 but it would take (EURO)300bn of investment to build the infrastructure in 
Europe alone, one study found this week. Even then, taxes on jet fuel would be needed to make hydrogen flight 
competitive.
The best medium-term bet is sustainable aviation fuel, made from waste oils, fats and non-food crops. The industry 
is counting on SAF for two-thirds of the contribution to achieving its net zero target. But it will be hard and costly to 
produce enough: Dave Calhoun, Boeing chief executive, warns that biofuels will "never achieve the price of jet fuel".
There is an iron logic to all this: flying is going to be expensive. I regret it, in many ways. Aviation is marvellous for 
taking holidays in interesting places and exploring the world, despite crowded airports and cramped seats. But 
flyers have not borne the full environmental price, even with carbon offsets, so something has to give.
Prices can be powerful, as the growth in flying encouraged by low cost carriers shows. The French government has 
decreed a ban on domestic flights of less than two and half hours between cities well connected by trains. France is 
an outlier but higher fares could have a similar impact elsewhere in squeezing short-haul flight, where there is a 
decent alternative.
For my part, I am going to Amsterdam next week by train. The Dutch government has been blocked by a court from 
curbing flights to Schiphol airport, and it would have been cheaper to fly. One day, it may not be.

The emptiest aircraft on which I ever flew was an All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to London in June 2020, 
amid the pandemic. It was a Boeing 777-300 with about 250 passenger seats, of which four were filled: in airline 
lingo, it had a load factor of less than two per cent.
We crossed continents like a ghost flight, the attendants devotedly sticking to their usual in-flight routines and 
walking by the empty rows of seats to confirm that nothing was amiss. Flight ANA-211 was a fragile link between 
Japan and the UK in the days when many passenger flights stopped: I booked at the last minute and the tickets 
were memorably cheap.
Flights are now much fuller, and fares higher. When I returned to Japan earlier this year, direct fares had doubled in 
price and I connected in Hong Kong to economise. The same is true of shorthaul flights as people book up eagerly 
for summer holidays: Ryanair, now Europe's biggest airline, this week reported strong bookings, and easyJet has 
done the same.
With stronger demand and higher jet fuel costs have come stiffer prices. Ryanair carried 16mn passengers in April - 
more than the same month in 2019 - and its aircraft were 94 per cent full. Its fares have risen by 10 per cent on pre- 
Covid levels and the carrier's famous (EURO)9.99 fares (before paying for bags and better seats) are a fading 
memory.
The price of flying will keep rising, even on Ryanair Top reads at www.FT.com/opinion John Gapper All

Airlines are notoriously cyclical and prone to losing money: the industry collectively lost $138bn in the annus 
horribilis of 2020, when I took the ghost flight to London. Even in good times, margins are tight. Prices have fallen in 
real terms for decades because they keep on buying new aircraft (Ryanair has ordered up to 300 737-Max 10s from 
Boeing) and trying to fill them.
Despite this, I believe the industry's warnings that we will have to pay more to fly. "We are in an entirely different 
world where air fares are rising," one executive told the FT this week. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, 
may keep squeezing rivals with his motto that "lowest cost wins" but it will not feel like that for the customer.
With restrictions lifted, people want to fly again: "Short-haul flying has roared back to life because of pent-up 
demand," says Frankie O'Connell, reader in air transport at the University of Surrey. They must contend with fewer, 
stronger carriers: Ryanair's flights were about 80 per cent full a decade ago, but seats are now scarcer.
Not only can such airlines charge more; they will soon have to. The industry faces a vast technological challenge in 
meeting its self-imposed target of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It is impossible to do so on the 
current flight path, given that aviation accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global emissions, and moving to another 
one will be extremely expensive.
Ryanair exemplifies the traditional approach: keep on growing but try to curb the environmental impact by replacing 
old aircraft with modern twinengined jets that burn less fuel. It promised this week that people switching to its flights 
from other airlines could cut their emissions by up to 50 per cent because of what it dubs its "gamechanger" fleet of 
newer 737s.
Well, up to a point. It is true that such aircraft help by reducing emissions per passenger, but it is slow going. The 
last of Ryanair's new Boeings is due to be delivered in 2033, only 17 years before the net zero target, and efficiency 
can only partly mitigate growth. Some 10bn passenger journeys are expected in 2050, five times the volume of 
2021.
There is little chance of turning to electric or hydrogen-powered aviation soon: Airbus intends to fly a zero-
emissions hydrogen plane by 2035 but it would take (EURO)300bn of investment to build the infrastructure in 
Europe alone, one study found this week. Even then, taxes on jet fuel would be needed to make hydrogen flight

easyJet (London Luton) has announced that it will launch a seasonal, summer-only base at Alicante airport in 
spring 2024.
The low-cost carrier said easyJet Europe (EC, Vienna) would deploy three A320-200s to the southern Spanish 
airport. It will allow it to increase the capacity offered during the Summer 2024 season by around 16% compared to 
the current capacity, provided by aircraft based elsewhere.
easyJet has been serving Alicante since 1999 without having a base at the airport. The ch-aviation capacities 
module shows it currently has an 11.7% market share by scheduled weekly departure capacity out of the airport 
(operated mainly by easyJet UK), trailing behind Ryanair but ahead of base carriers Vueling Airlines and Jet2 
(United Kingdom).
The airline did not disclose its network plans related to the base launch.
Alicante will be easyJet Europe's fourth base in Spain, following Barcelona El Prat, Malaga, and Palma de Mallorca. 
Only the Barcelona base is year-round.

May 26, 2023( Zacks Investment Research: http://www.zacks.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  
 In the past week, Ryanair Holdings RYAAY[1] reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 2023. Revenues also beat the consensus mark and increased year over year, owing to upbeat traffic 
volumes. 
American Airlines AAL[2] was also in the news, courtesy of its agreement in principle with its pilot union, Allied 
Pilots Association. Meanwhile, AAL's Northeast Alliance with JetBlue Airways JBLU[3] ran into rough weather 
following a court ruling to end the partnership. Delta Air Lines DAL[4] also grabbed headlines courtesy of its 
decision to appoint a new chief operating officer. Recap of the Past Week's Most Important Stories 1. Ryanair 
reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 (ended Mar 31, 2023) loss of 73 cents per share (excluding a penny from non-
recurring items), narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 99 cents. In the year-ago reported 
quarter, RYAAY had incurred a loss of 98 cents per share. Revenues of $1,981.5 million beat the Zacks Consensus 
Estimate of $1,908.7 million. Revenues improved year over year, driven by upbeat passenger volumes. 
On the back of the buoyant traffic scenario, RYAAY's profit after tax was €1.42 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 
against a net loss of €355 million incurred a year ago. Ryanair expects[5] traffic for fiscal 2024 to be 185 million. 
Currently, Ryanair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can seethe complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
Buy) stocks here[6]. 
2. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents 15,000 plus pilots at AAL, reached an agreement in principle with 
the company. If the collective bargaining agreement materializes, American Airlines pilots would be eligible for a 
21% pay raise this year. Further details will be available shortly. 
3. American Airlines and JetBlue received a major setback when a federal judge ordered the companies to 
terminate their alliance in the Northeast as it was anti-competitive. The verdict is in line with the Justice 
Department's opinion. The Justice Department's antitrust suit, filed more than a year ago, accused the alliance of 
stifling competition. The judge ordered the companies to end the alliance within 30 days of the ruling. Both carriers 
are likely to challenge the decision. In fact, AAL's management said that the ruling will not impact its earnings 
performance. 
4. Delta announced that it will get a new chief operating officer from Jun 12. This Atlanta-based carrier appointed 
Mike Spanos for the new role. Spanos has more than two decades of work experience and has been associated 
with many big companies. Most recently, he was with Six Flags Entertainment SIX[7] as its president and CEO. 
Airline Stock Roundup: RYAAY 's Q4 Loss, AAL's Labor Deal & More
Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and 
during the last six months. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research 
The table above shows that stocks exhibited a mixed trend with respect to price over the past week. However, the 
gains were muted in nature. As a result, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gained marginally over the past week. Over 
the course of past six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index has appreciated 3.9%. What's Next in the Airline 
Space? Investors will be looking forward to further updates on the alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue.

Ryanair Holdings PLC (LSE:RYA) and easyJet PLC have both been graced with share price target upgrades from 
Deutsche Bank analysts, predicting the low-cost duo will remain key players in the sector's recovery.
Deutsche raised Ryanair's share price target from (EURO)20 to (EURO)22.50, up 12.5% on Wednesday's close, 
alongside anticipating a 4% 25p jump to 635p for easyJet stock.
easyJet's interim results of an 80% jump in revenue and falling headline losses were met with optimism by 
Deutsche, which commented: "We stay ahead of consensus, with ample room to go higher."
Analysts also raised full-year pre-tax profit forecasts for easyJet by 17%, now predicting the figure to come in 
around £436mln, thanks to lower fuel costs and higher earnings from holiday packages.
On Ryanair, Deutsche judged: "The 2023 results didn't disappoint, with fourth quarter fares revenues, in particular, 
coming in ahead of our expectations."
Full-year revenues jumped 124% to (EURO)10.8bn at the Irish airline, while post-tax profit recovered to 
(EURO)1.43bn after a loss last year.
Deutsche also echoed previous remarks that Ryanair would "remain a structural winner in European aviation".
Both airlines saw 'buy' ratings reiterated by the bank.

Ryanair has celebrated the EU General Court's ruling on discriminatory State aid, which favoured Italian airlines 
over other EU airlines during the pandemic. 
Ryanair appealed the EU Commission's approval of these subsidies to the EU General Court in 2021, stating that 
the schemes purposefully ignored airlines that "contribute to the economy and connectivity of the European Union".
During the Covid pandemic, more than (EURO)40bn in State subsidies were gifted to EU flag carriers. In 2020, the 
Italian government, with the EU Commission's approval, gave (EURO)130 million to some airlines holding an Italian 
licence.
The judgement also follows on from the EU General Court's annulments of a (EURO)6bn aid package to Lufthansa 
and (EURO)1bn to SAS.
On this backing from the EU Court, a Ryanair spokesperson said: "The judgment confirms that the Commission 
must act as a guardian of the level playing field in air transport and cannot sign off discriminatory State aid under 
political pressure by national governments. The Court's intervention is a triumph for fair competition and consumers 
across the EU."

Germany 's Lufthansa to take over 40% stake in Italy 's ITA Airways
Germany's Lufthansa to take over 40% stake in Italy's ITA Airways
dpa international (Englischer Dienst)

Dateline: Rome (dpa) - 
Body
German airline Lufthansa has agreed to take over a minority stake in the Italian airline ITA Airways, both airlines 
announced at the signing of the contract in Rome on Thursday.
ITA was formed in 2020 after a restructuring of the failed Alitalia, which the government in Rome took over in March 
of the same year when various takeover bids failed.
After months of negotiations this year with the Italian state, Lufthansa acquired an initial 40% of ITA's shares.
Earlier media reports said the German airline plans to pay between (EURO)320 million and (EURO)330 million 
($343.36 million-$354.09 million) for the stake.
Both parties have now confirmed the agreement in principle, but have not yet confirmed specific figures.
Once ITA Airways begins to make profit again, the reports said Lufthansa may then invest a further (EURO)500 
million to acquire 50% to 55% of its shares, which would be a majority stake.
The Italian state would thus remain a shareholder for the time being, in contrast to Lufthansa's initial plans.
The deal is subject to competition law reviews at both a national and European level.
While Italia Trasporto Aereo (ITA) took over the flight operations of its insolvent predecessor Alitalia in October 
2021, it is not its legal successor.
ITA has, however, secured take-off and landing rights as well as the Alitalia brand. The legendary name could 
possibly soon be reactivated under the new corporate umbrella.
Germany 's Lufthansa to take over 40% stake in Italy 's ITA Airways
Lufthansa strategy chief Jörg Eberhart, who already headed the regional subsidiary Air Dolomiti operating in 
northern Italy, is being discussed as the new head of ITA.
Last year ITA made a loss of (EURO)486 million ($521 million) on a turnover of just under (EURO)1.6 billion. At the 
end of March, the company cited the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, increased fuel costs due to the 
Ukraine war and the poor euro-dollar exchange rate as the reasons for the figures in the red.
The target for 2027 is now 94 aircraft and a turnover of (EURO)4.1 billion.
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr spoke of a win-win situation for Italy, ITA and his company. He wants to 
bring the lean Alitalia successor with its young fleet into the profit zone via higher load factors, cheaper purchasing 
and better flight coordination.
Lufthansa has wanted to gain a foothold in its second most important foreign market for many years. An attempt 
launched in 2009 under the name Lufthansa Italia came to an end in 2011.
At present, the Lufthansa Group only attracts transfer passengers from rich northern Italy to the Munich hub with 
flights operated by Air Dolomiti. Now, with ITA, Lufthansa is acquiring market share in an environment dominated by 
non-domestic low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Easyjet.
Deutsche Lufthansa AG has already taken over the former state-owned airlines of neighbouring Switzerland, 
Austria and Belgium and has continued to operate them as independent brands.
The Belgian Sabena successor Brussels Airlines had been taken over by Lufthansa in two stages, initially also 
starting with a minority stake.
Another possible takeover target is TAP of Portugal.

Ryanair settles for higher price to secure 737 Max 10 slots
Production slot scarcity has helped push Ryanair into reaching a deal with Boeing for 737 Max 10s but group chief 
executive Michael O’Leary admits the airline had to settle for a higher price than it sought.
The airline is taking up to 300 Max 10s, with deliveries set to begin in 2027, it announced on 9 May. About half of 
these aircraft will replace older 737s in its fleet, while the rest will be used for expansion.
Boeing has been “tight for slots”, O’Leary notes, with the deal having resulted from a “meeting of minds”.
“[Its] orderbook is filling up rapidly,” he says. “If we hadn’t moved quickly, we might have been looking at later 
deliveries, 2028-29.”
The airline had resumed talks with Boeing on a Max 10 order, having previously discontinued negotiations in 2021, 
citing differences over the price.
O’Leary admits Ryanair “paid more per seat this time round than last time”, but adds: “We are still incredibly happy 
with the deal we have done.”
He suggests that a delivery gap of around 18 months between the last of its 197-seat 737 Max 8-200s and the first 
of its ­228‑seat Max 10s will benefit the airline.
“It suits us to take a break for a year,” O’Leary says, arguing that the pause from a “tumultuous” decade of growth in 
summer 2026 will present an opportunity to improve operational reliability.
He adds that it will also reduce capital expenditure and enable the carrier to generate “significant cashflow” which 
will support the funding of the Max 10 deliveries.
European competition
No Headline In Original
O’Leary says the step up to a 228-seat aircraft is a “big challenge” – not least to maintain 25min turnaround times – 
but points out that the airline is having to compete in Europe with 230-seat Airbus jets, such as those operated by 
budget carrier Wizz Air.
O’Leary says that this would have been “difficult” if the carrier had stuck to the high-density 197-seat Max 8-200s, 
but the Max 10 will enable it to “meet and beat Airbus competition”. He adds that the 15% higher seat‑count 
provides “huge ancillary opportunities”.
Ryanair has “no interest” in using the Max 10s on transatlantic routes, O’Leary says. He insists the long-haul, low-
cost operational model “fundamentally doesn’t work” and the carrier will instead focus on longer-range services 
beyond Europe, such as flights to the Middle East.
But he states that the “biggest prize” is to return to Ukraine, claiming that Ryanair – which has been hiring large 
numbers of Ukrainian pilots and cabin crew – intends to be the first airline to restore services to the country once 
the conflict is over.
“We will go back within two weeks of it being declared safe by European authorities,” says O’Leary, adding that the 
airline wants to set up operations in three or four Ukrainian airports.
The Max deal – yet to be finalised – comprises 150 firm and 150 optioned jets, which will be delivered over the 
course of 2027-2033.
Ryanair values the agreement at more than $40 billion at catalogue prices. Shareholders will vote on the order at a 
14 September meeting.
The airline had 523 aircraft at the end of 2022, including 84 of the 737 Max 8-200.

Court annuls EU approval of $140 million of COVID-19 aid for Italian airlines
Court annuls EU approval of $140 million of COVID-19 aid for Italian airlines

BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union court ruled Wednesday that the European Commission was wrong to 
approve millions of euros (dollars) in aid to help Italian airlines cope with the impact of COVID-19 restrictions.
The EU general court said the European Commission — the bloc's executive arm — failed to provide “a statement 
of reasons for its finding that the measure at issue was not contrary to EU law provisions other than those 
governing state aid.”
The 27 EU member countries must seek approval from the bloc’s executive branch when granting financial support 
to companies. Many countries across Europe did so in 2020 to help keep their airlines afloat during the pandemic.
In October 2020, Italian authorities informed the European Commission of their plans to provide 130 million euros 
($140 million) to airlines holding an Italian license under certain conditions, and the commission did not raise 
objections.
To benefit from the aid, airlines were required to pay their Italy-based employees — as well as employees of third-
party companies involved in their activities — a remuneration at least equal to the minimum set by the national 
collective agreement applicable to the air transport sector. Air Dolomiti, Neos and Blue Panorama, now known as 
Luke Air, fulfilled the requirements.
The case was brought by low-cost airline Ryanair, which also was struggling to survive at the time.
It was the second judicial win in a month for the Irish carrier after the court annulled decisions by the commission 
approving massive bailouts designed to help Lufthansa and SAS.
It was not immediately clear what impact the ruling, which can be appealed, might have, and if the airlines would 
have to pay the money back. The European Commission said it “will carefully study the judgment and reflect on 
possible next steps.”
The commission is the EU’s anti-trust watchdog. As pandemic restrictions in 2020 brought travel to a halt and 
threatened the existence of airlines, the commission eased its policies, approving billions of euros in support for 
national flag-carriers.
Court annuls EU approval of $140 million of COVID-19 aid for Italian airlines
Under a fast-track system set up during what the commission described as “an unprecedented crisis,” Brussels 
approved around 3 trillion euros in state support across all sectors in the 27 member nations. Ryanair believes that 
40 billion euros was granted to Europe’s airline sector alone.

Ryanair has won its legal challenge against Italian state aid given to airlines during the COVID pandemic.
On May 24, 2023, the European Court of Justice decided to annul the European Commission's clearing of the 
Italian state aid.
Ryanair argued that the Italian government granted a (EURO)130 million ($160M) aid package only to airlines 
holding an operating license issued by Italy.
"The General Court annuls the Commission's decision to approve an aid measure consisting in subsidies paid by 
Italy to Italian airlines in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic," a statement from the Court of Justice read.
According to the Irish Times, when the Commision was told of the Italian government's subsidy program in October 
2020, no objections were raised.
Ryanair launched legal action, believing that the aid violated principles of European law.
Ryanair said governments, including Italy, "rushed through discriminatory subsidy schemes limited to their own 
former flag carriers".
The low-cost carrier argued that "Ryanair is Italy's largest airline yet was excluded by the Italian government from 
these schemes".
Ryanair has launched a number of legal challenges over EU subsidies granted during the COVID pandemic.
The judgment follows on from the EU General Court's recent annulments of the European Commission's clearances 
of aid packages to Lufthansa and to SAS.
"One of the EU's greatest achievements is the creation of a single market for air transport. The European 
Commission's approval of the aid scheme limited to airlines with an operating license issued by the Italian State 
went against the fundamental principles of EU law," a Ryanair spokesperson said.

They added: "The judgment confirms that the Commission must act as a guardian of the level playing field in air 
transport and cannot sign-off discriminatory State aid under political pressure by national governments. The Court's 
intervention is a triumph for fair competition and consumers across the EU."

Airlines are so high up the pyramid of capitalism they no longer compete on price

IN November last year, an inverted pyramid of conspiracy theories went viral. Those at the bottom, at the tip of the 
upside down triangle, - those most grounded in reality - include "Big Tobacco lied about lung cancer" and "NSA 
mass surveillance". The top, labelled the "antisemitic point of no return", stretches from reptilian overlords, 
Holocaust denial, Illuminati and Nazis on the moon.
It's a useful illustration of how extremism works, and builds, one layer creating the building blocks for the next. You 
could use a similar model for a less pernicious C word - capitalism. Right at the very top of a capitalist pyramid 
would be airlines. Since the pandemic, the cost of flying has soared, and the quality has plummeted.
The world's first low-cost airline was Pacific Southwest Airlines, which started flights between Dallas, Houston and 
San Tanio in the US. It turned a profit for 47 consecutive financial years from 1973. The first year it made a loss 
was in the first year of the pandemic.
Since then, Virgin Air, Ryanair, Wizz Air, and almost countless others have been spawned from Southwest.
The quality of airlines like Wizz or Vueling is now so unreliable, so liable to be delayed or cancelled, that Easy jet, 
once fondly nicknamed "sleazy jet" for its cheap flights at ungodly hours from periphery airports, has almost been 
elevated to the likes of British Airways, which, itself, is long past its prime.
And yet, the costs keep going up. The airlines blame the pandemic, they blame the cost of fuel, they blame the 
airports, the striking staff.
Airlines are so high up the pyramid of capitalism they no longer compete on price
Last week, in the same breath that they posted record profits of £1.26bn, Ryanair warned about a higher fuel bill 
and delays on new Boeing planes.
Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, said the cost of flights would rise by 15 per cent over the summer.
Airlines aren't so much as milking it as making their own-brand cool-aid and make us drink it (for a cost, of course). 
Where a carry-on bag was once a given, anything bigger than a handbag can now add £70 onto the cost of a flight 
to Europe.
Families, refusing to shell out to sit next to one another, frequently cause a mini-upheaval as they ask air hostesses 
to move everyone around to seat them together once they board.
This "unpackaging" model was once actually quite convenient. It meant those to whom large-carry on baggage or 
aisle seats was important, could pay to include it, without meaning the cost of all of this was bundled into the one 
set cost of a flight, allowing them to charge cheap prices for the basic rate. In other words, it enabled flexibility and 
consumer choice, all the things capitalism is known for achieving through competitive markets.
But the airlines have, in unison it seems, decided to treat this not as a useful model, but a kind of endless cash cow. 
The undercutting which was once the bread-and-butter of low-cost airlines has given way. I have little doubt there 
are rooms in the hallways of all the HQs of airlines where people semi-regularly pile in to figure out what they can 
charge extra for next.
Enter Qantas, the national carrier of Australia, and one of the most upmarket airlines, on par with British Airways or 
some of the better Asian carriers.
Qantas has said it expects to post a record underlying profit of up to AU$2.48bn, almost a billion dollars higher than 
its previous record in 2018.
Last week, the airline also announced a new feature: neighbour free flying. Instead of staring, fingers crossed, at 
the empty seat next to you, you can simply pay for it - like everything else on a plane. Between two days to an hour 
beforehand, customers can pay AU$65 (£35) to choose a seat without a neighbour. If the airline ends up filling the 
seat, they will issue a refund.
On one level, it's ingenious. Where Qantas can't fill the seats, they can still make some cash.
On the other hand, it's a signal of just how far up the capitalism pyramid we have climbed.
Monopolies have long been blamed for high costs to consumers or unfair terms. The airline industry is rife with 
competition, especially in Europe. And yet, no one seems to be competing on price anymore. The big names seem 
to have tacitly accepted they no longer need to fight for customers where they can charge for extras. The creep of 
prices will continue until, eventually, we find ourselves being charged to have a tray table. God only knows all we 
want is to be able to pay for a plane which arrives at all, let alone on time.

 Roman Protasevich (pictured) was pardoned by the Belarusian government news agency BelTA on Monday (22 
May). He was arrested in 2021, after his Ryanair flight was forced to land at Minsk. 
 Protasevich told reporters: "I literally signed all relevant documents that state that I've been pardoned," BelTA 
reported. "This is great news."
 Protasevich was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, for crimes including inciting terrorism and mass 
disturbances. He also slandered Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko.
 He was a journalist for the news outlet Nexta. Nexta reported extensively on the mass protests that took place 
against Lukashenko after the presidential election in 2020, which the opposition and Western governments deemed 
to be rigged.
 All significant opposition figures were jailed or forced into exile during the clampdown that took place around the 
time of elections.
 Stsiapan Rudik, the former editor of Nexta and Stsiapan putsila, its founder, were both sentenced to jail in absentia 
in the same court for 20 and 19 years respectively. Belarus declared Nexta a "terrorist organization" last year.
 The arrest of Protasevich in May 2021 caused international outrage, and led to sanctions by the European Union 
against Lukashenko.
 Protasevich, after his arrest, was shown on television tearing up as he confessed to being involved in anti-
government demonstrations and plotting the overthrow of Lukashenko. The exiled Belarusian opposition claimed 
that the confessions were false, and had been forced.

Ryanair Secures EU Court's Favorable Ruling in Italian Airline State Aid Challenge
Ryanair Secures EU Court's Favorable Ruling in Italian Airline State Aid 
Challenge

 The European Union Court of Justice repealed the European Commission's approval of Italy's state aid to local 
airlines affected by the COVID-19 pandemic following a challenge brought by Ryanair (RYA.IR).
The verdict resulted from the commission's failure to issue a statement of reasons proving that the proposed state 
measure will not violate the European Union's law provisions outside government aid regulations, according to a 
Wednesday release. In October 2020, Italy told the commission that it awarded 130 million euros in subsidies to 
certain airlines with an Italian license amid air travel disruptions due to COVID-19-related restrictions. 
The court also noted that the commission authorized the state aid based on its compatibility with the internal 
market, without launching a formal inquiry as provided by EU laws.
On May 10, the Irish budget airline received a favorable ruling in another action for annulment involving the German 
government's 6 billion-euro financial aid to Lufthansa (LHA.F).
Ryanair lost about 1% in recent trade, while Lufthansa fell nearly 2%.

A European Union court has annulled the approval for state aid granted to Italian airlines worth (EURO)130 million 
($140 million) during the Covid-19 pandemic in a ruling on Wednesday.
The EU General Court cancelled the European Commission's approval after finding that the basis for compatibility 
with EU law had not been sufficiently justified, according to a statement.
Budget airline Ryanair filed the complaint against the state support from Italy. It follows a similar court decision 
taken against German state aid awarded to German airline company Lufthansa.
The (EURO)130 million in funds was intended to compensate the airlines for damages suffered as a result of Covid-
19-related travel restrictions.
According to the EU General Court, the commission should have either explained why the competition authority had 
no issue with the state aid or started an investigation.
State support is usually closely regulated, however restrictions were loosened during the pandemic. The 
commission is the bloc's top authority on competition matters and approves state subsidies.
The ruling may be appealed at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the bloc's highest court.

Ryanair had its target price raised by analysts at Liberum which note pricing strength in tickets could be sustained 
for "some time."
Liberum held its buy recommendation while increasing the target price to (EURO)20.5 from (EURO)19.
The budget airline was upbeat on the long-term prospects of the company, remaining hopeful that the 
demand/supply balance will remain in favour of the carriers.
Capacity is likely to remain constrained because of subdued production levels at Airbus and Boeing for a prolonged 
period, Liberum said. 
German airline Lufthansa also talked about enforced capacity restraints, which means strength in the pricing 
environment could be sustained for some time.
With that being said, Ryanair was less upbeat in the short term, suggesting competitors were "excessively 
optimistic" about unit revenue for this summer.
Liberum notes this could be down to several reasons, including "Ryanair's faster capacity growth giving it a unit 
revenue headwind."
Ryanair is also sensitive to the last-minute market, with a disproportionate amount of revenue coming from 
passengers booking just before their trip.
Ryanair 's target price hiked by broker following strong results
Yesterday, the Irish carrier said revenues jumped 124% to (EURO)10.8bn as fares rose compared to a 75% hike in 
costs.
After-tax profits to recover to (EURO)1.43bn from Covid-dominated losses of (EURO)355mln the year before.
