THOMAS Cook has set a deadline of 7 May for expressions of interest in its airline business, with Indigo Partners 
and Lufthansa among the likely bidders, sources said.
The heavily-indebted British travel group put its profitable airline business up for sale in February after profit 
warnings in 2018 left it needing to raise cash.
Thomas Cook's airlines business consists of Germany's Condor, as well as British, Scandinavian and Spanish 
operations.
A source familiar with the discussions said that Indigo and Germany's Lufthansa appeared most interested in the 
business.
British Airways owner IAG should not be ruled out and Easyjet has engaged in talks but is seen as less interested, 
the source added.
It is not clear whether Ireland's Ryanair would bid.

Ryanair is "in advanced negotiations" to sell 10 of its oldest Boeing 737-800s for more than (EURO)170 million 
($184 million) within the current fiscal year (FY), following a predicted fall in profit for FY2019.
For the year ended 31 March 2019, Europe's largest low-cost carrier reported a (EURO)1.2 billion operating profit, 
29% lower than FY2018 - or 39% if one includes the result of its recently acquired Laudamotion subsidiary.
The airline also has delayed delivery of its first five 737 Max 200 aircraft to the winter 2019 season, having 
previously intended to take its initial aircraft in the first half of the year.
As a result, the Irish carrier says that any meaningful cost impact from the aircraft's better economics won't be felt 
until the 2021 fiscal year. It has 135 Max 200s on firm order and 75 options.
Since the FY2019 date, Ryanair has closed a five-year, (EURO)750 million unsecured debt facility, which will partly 
fund capital expenditure of (EURO)2 billion this year, up from (EURO)1.5 billion in 2018/19.    At 31 March 2019 the 
airline had a fleet of 474 aircraft. It put 29 additional 737s onto its balance sheet in 2018/19, which helped to push 
up depreciation by 13% to (EURO)635 million in FY2019.
More owned aircraft meant a 20% reduction in leasing costs, but operating profit also had to contend with 28% 
higher staff costs and 23% higher fuel costs. Overall non-fuel unit cost growth was 5%.
The current financial year will fully consolidate Laudamotion's results and Ryanair is forecasting net income of 
(EURO)750 million to (EURO)950 million, which compares with (EURO)885 million for FY2019.
The airline has applied IFRS 16 lease accounting from 1 April, and guides that the standard will push up liabilities 
by about (EURO)140 million.
At 31 March 2019 Ryanair had net debt of (EURO)450 million and cash and cash equivalents of (EURO)1.68 billion.

Two years on from Alitalia's filing for administration, the fate of the Italian flag carrier still hangs in the balance.
The drawn-out privatisation process that has been running since May 2017 has offered more clarity on who is not 
interested in investing than on who is.
By October 2017, the Italian government had, it said, received seven expressions of interest. Ryanair – after 
showing early interest in the stricken Italian carrier – had already ruled itself out, but both EasyJet and Lufthansa 
were participating in the process. Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines would later emerge as interested parties. 
Wizz Air was also named as another tentative candidate.
By late 2018, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane had become a linchpin of the process and by February 2019 the state-
owned railway company had opened talks with Cerberus Capital Management, Delta and EasyJet, with a view to 
creating a consortium that would run the SkyTeam carrier.
In parallel, the participation of Air France-KLM and Lufthansa appeared to wane. In February, there were reports 
that the Franco-Dutch airline group was pulling out of the process. Lufthansa was similarly said to have pulled back, 
possibly after the Italian government balked at the level of cuts at, and involvement in, a restructured Alitalia that the 
Star Alliance group was demanding.
Neither airline group formally renounced their interest in the flag carrier, and they hinted that they would continue to 
monitor the situation.
Talks between Ferrovie and its potential consortium partners continued but were hit in March by the announcement 
that EasyJet was formally leaving the process.
ANALYSIS: Alitalia's two years in administrative limbo; Two years on from Alitalia's filing for administration, the 
fate of the Italian flag carrier still hangs....
The prospects for the Italian airline appear to have narrowed just as the stakes are rising. The deadline for firm bids 
formally ended on 30 April, and media reports suggest that Ferrovie has requested an extension, which is currently 
being considered by the Italian government.
Reuters has reported that the railway group and Delta are ready to contribute to a bid worth around 1 billion ($1.1 
billion), but this would still leave a shortfall of around 400 million. The Italian government, it has been mooted, could 
take a share in the carrier by swapping debt for shares.
While efforts to build a rescue package for the Italian carrier continue, another issue that remains unresolved is the 
900 million loan provided by the Italian government to the carrier shortly after it entered administration.
The European Commission opened an investigation into the loan in April 2018 to decide whether it constituted 
illegal state aid. Its ultimate decision could have major repercussions for the airline's very survival.
HOLDING STEADY
Fleet, seats and passenger data suggests that Alitalia has remained in a state of semi-stasis over the past two 
years, and by virtue of this has lost some ground to competitors.
Cirium schedules data shows that the airline's seat capacity has grown slightly over the period. In May 2017, total 
seat capacity stood at 28.8 million; it is now 29.6 million.
Since 2017, Alitalia has shed routes from Milan to Buenos Aires. Routes from Milan and Rome to Abu Dhabi, the 
home of Alitalia's former shareholder, Etihad, have also been scrapped.
For the most part, however, Alitalia's long-haul network is largely unchanged. In the transatlantic market, the carrier 
has continued to offer services to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Toronto from Rome, while from 
Milan Malpensa it has continued to serve New York. This month, the SkyTeam carrier started services to 
Washington.
Services to Seoul and Tokyo have continued unabated. Flights to Beijing have been suspended, but Delhi has been 
restored as an Alitalia destination after a nine-year gap.
Flights to Buenos Aires Rio de Janeiro, Santiago and Sao Paulo from Rome have continued, while a route from 
Milan Malpensa to Buenos Aires has been suspended.
In 2018, Alitalia resumed services to South Africa after a 16-year absence, with the start of services to 
Johannesburg.
While the long-haul network remains roughly intact, Alitalia has been forced to grapple with new competitors on 
some trunk routes. Luckily for the Italian carrier, these rivals have experienced their own problems.
Alitalia is now challenged at Rome by budget carrier Norwegian, which is offering flights to Fort Lauderdale, Los 
Angeles and New York.
From Milan Malpensa, Air Italy – bolstered by minority shareholder Qatar Airways – has ambitions to take a greater 
share of Italy's long-haul business. This summer the carrier is operating from Malpensa to Los Angeles, New York 
and San Francisco.
However, the competition Alitalia faces has remained relatively unchanged, with the Italian flag carrier mainly facing 
the likes of American Airlines, Delta and United Airlines. Cirium data shows that Alitalia is the second-largest airline 
operating between the USA and Italy, after American.
Cirium's Fleets Analyzer shows that the Alitalia fleet is declining in size, from 101 aircraft in 2017 to a projected 83 
by the end of this year.
ANALYSIS: Alitalia's two years in administrative limbo; Two years on from Alitalia's filing for administration, the 
fate of the Italian flag carrier still hangs....
The number of 777s has been reduced from 11 in 2017 to six this year, while the number of A321s in service with 
the carrier has fallen from 12 to seven.
ENAC data shows that last year Alitalia was Italy's second-largest carrier by absolute passenger numbers. The 
airline carried just under 21.8 million passengers in 2018, while Italy's largest airline – Ryanair – carried just under 
37.8 million.
Alitalia's passenger numbers actually grew by 1% in 2018. This is an improvement on the previous year, when the 
SkyTeam carrier lost 5.8%, representing approximately 1.5 million passengers.
It remains the third-largest international operator in Italy, after Ryanair and EasyJet.
The airline is still Italy's largest domestic airline, having carried almost 12.2 million such passengers in 2018, but it 
was only just ahead of Ryanair, which carried 11.1 million. This is little different from the domestic market positions 
in 2017.
The flag carrier is the largest airline operating at Cagliari, Milan Linate, Reggio Calabria, Rome Fiumicino and 
Trieste. Comparing this to 2017, Alitalia lost its position as the largest airline operating at Alghero, Genoa and 
Pantelleria.
ALLIANCES
Perhaps the biggest blow from a commercial point of view over the two years since the airline went into 
administration has been Alitalia's forced exit from the joint ventures it was previously in with Air France, Delta Air 
Lines and KLM.
The airline exited its European joint venture with Air France-KLM in 2017 and has since 2018 been excluded – at 
least until the result of its restructuring becomes clear – from the partners' transatlantic tie-up since 2018, 
supplanted by Virgin Atlantic.
While the Italian carrier can still leverage on the benefits of its membership of the SkyTeam alliance, it is likely that 
the loss of revenues from the tie-up with Delta and Air France-KLM will be keenly felt, given that the transatlantic 
market is a critically important one.
The continued presence of Delta in talks to buy a stake in Alitalia might give the Italian airline's management some 
optimism that the relationship can be resurrected once the sale process is complete.
RESTRUCTURE
Assuming that Ferrovie is able to pull together a consortium that successfully takes over Alitalia, what are the 
prospects for it to become profitable? Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend by Cirium, is gloomy about the Italian 
carrier's prospects of a successful restructure.
"After two decades of one form or another of the same kind of problems, it's inevitably difficult to be optimistic that 
this time it's going to be different," he says.
"The first problem is that the European market, on both the demand and supply side, has moved on dramatically 
over the last 20 years – in particular with the rise of the two big EU low-cost operators to become the biggest in 
Europe and with EasyJet and Ryanair taking a significant chunk out of what was once Alitalia's core international 
and domestic markets (and indeed expanding these significantly). It is difficult for Alitalia to claim to customers or 
politicians it has something special to offer in terms of service or product that the other airlines are not offering," 
Morris argues.
He adds that as "nothing substantial" has come from talks with Air France, KLM and Lufthansa to date, a marketing 
and business relationship with a big European alliance player appears "essential" to ensure the effective survival of

a smaller national airline. Examples of this dynamic he sees in the survival of carriers such as Aer Lingus, Austrian 
Airlines, Brussels Airlines and Swiss.
Italy remains one of the biggest European national markets for both business and leisure travel, providing the 
potential for Alitalia to be "financially viable", says Morris. "The question is whether a revamped Alitalia business 
model is able to be financially viable on the kinds of routes, services and prices that this market will support."
Ultimately, Morris believes, one of the biggest challenges may be that making the cuts needed at Alitalia could also 
reduce the opportunity for the Italian airline to garner economies of scale required for successful growth. It "will be 
going in the opposite direction from the low-cost competitors who can cut their fares further and still make profits", 
he warns.

Two aircraft have been involved in a minor ramp collision at the UK’s regional East Midlands airport.
The airport’s operator says that one of the aircraft was taxiing when it “made contact” with a stationary aircraft on 30 
April.
It states that the incident occurred on the central passenger apron.
Images on social media purporting to show the scene of the event indicate that Boeing 737s operated by Ryanair 
and Jet2 were involved.
“There were no passengers on either aircraft and no one was injured,” the operator adds. “Flights are continuing as 
scheduled.”
The extent of any damage to the aircraft is yet to be confirmed.
Meteorological data for East Midlands shows the airport was advising of reduced visibility owing to mist and fog 
during the morning.

       FRANKFURT (dpa-AFX) - The foundation stone for a major extension to Frankfurt Airport in the form of a third 
terminal was laid on Monday in the face of protest from local residents fearing an increase in noise and emissions.  
As the official ceremony was held with 700 invited guests, opponents of the terminal held a vigil at the airport's 
Terminal 1.  The first phase, to be completed in 2021, will take some of the load off the current two terminals, which 
handled 70 million passengers last year. 
By 2023, the new terminal is intended to handle 21 million passengers.  When complete, up to 25 million 
passengers a year will pass through it.  Fraport, the company that operates Germany's main hub, is planning to 
invest some 4 billion euros (4.5 billion dollars) in the project - one of the largest private infrastructure undertakings 
in Europe.  While the company has not identified potential clients, speculation was that the new gates available 
from 2021 would be well suited to the needs of budget carriers, such as Dublin-based Ryanair.  Speaking for the 
protestors opposed to the new terminal, Thomas Scheffler said the foundation stone was a gravestone for the 
region. The protestors are calling for a halt to the project and an extension of the overnight period during which no 
flights are allowed.  They are also demanding a cut in the number of flight movements to 380,000 a year. Last year 
the airport saw more than 512,000 flight movements and is aiming at capacity for more than 700,000.   Copyright

Ryanair aims to double routes and passengers to Jordan
Ryanair aims to double routes and passengers to Jordan

Ryanair aims to double the number of routes and passengers it flies to Jordan next year following rapid growth 
since launching flights to the country last year, the head of Europe's biggest budget airline told Reuters.
The Irish airline, which began flying to Jordan in February 2018, currently operates 14 routes to the capital Amman 
and the Red Sea port city of Aqaba, and will add four new routes for the winter season in Europe.
After talks with Jordanian officials, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he expected to reach around 1 million 
passengers in 2020 from the roughly 500,000 expected this year.
"We could double the number of routes to 40 routes connecting other cities in Germany, Poland, Italy, Greece and 
others to Jordan," O'Leary said in an interview in Amman, urging the government to waive a $56 visa at the airport 
to help boost passenger numbers.
O'Leary said Ryanair in total expected to carry almost 150 million passengers this year, the vast majority on routes 
in the European Union, although it also flies to some non-EU countries, including Israel and Morocco.
Jordan has courted Ryanair, which flew 300,000 passengers in the first year of its launch, a key factor behind the 
13 percent rise in tourism receipts last year to a record $5.2 billion.
The recovery in tourism has been a major economic boost to the cash-strapped country that has been forced to 
adopt IMF-guided austerity measures, sparking major protests last year.
Jordan's open skies agreement with the EU in 2010 that abolished all restrictions gave the country an edge over 
other Middle Eastern countries that have sought to protect their national carriers.
Ryanair aims to double routes and passengers to Jordan
"Jordan is Ryanair's by far fastest (growing) winter sun destination. It's growing faster than Morocco, Canary 
Islands, Southern Italy and Greece. You have an enormous potential here for inbound tourism," O'Leary said.
Morocco is Ryanair's biggest market in the Middle East, with 2.5 million passengers annually, followed by Israel 
which gets 1.3 million to Tel Aviv airport alone.
In European tourists' minds, Jordan and Israel are less of a security concern than other destinations in the Middle 
East, such as Tunisia and Egypt, O'Leary said.
"Jordan is very much ahead of Middle Eastern destinations ... In European minds there are no security or safety 
issues visiting Jordan and Israel," he said. (Reuters)

At the beginning of 2018, Vienna International airport could count itself among a select group of European hubs that 
had remained largely unaffected by the low-cost carriers' onward march.
While it is true that EasyJet, Eurowings and Vueling all operated services to the Austrian capital, each had a 
relatively small presence at the gateway compared with the dominant carrier there: Austrian Airlines. EasyJet had 
chosen to register its mainland European business in Austria as a response to Brexit, but the UK carrier bases no 
aircraft at Vienna.
Those seeking cheaper alternatives would have needed to drive the short distance to Slovakian capital Bratislava, 
or perhaps further to Budapest, where Ryanair and Wizz Air held sway.
But within the space of 12 months, various unexpected events have made the Austrian capital's airport a key 
battleground for the biggest European low-cost carriers.
In January 2018, Wizz disclosed plans to add Austria to its network later that year, with the establishment of a base 
at – and 17 routes from – Vienna. Two months later, the airline outlined further increases in the number of based 
aircraft and routes.
Also in January 2018, it looked as though IAG would pick up Austrian regional carrier Niki – at the time Vienna's 
third-biggest carrier, after Austrian and its sibling Eurowings – from the sale of Air Berlin's former assets.
That deal collapsed in dramatic fashion later that month, after a legal technicality led to insolvency proceedings for 
the regional carrier being scrapped in Germany and reopened in Austria.
ANALYSIS: Low-cost carriers vie for dominance at Vienna At the beginning of 2018, Vienna International 
airport could count itself among a select group of Europe....
The airline's founder Niki Lauda ultimately emerged as the victor in that new sale process and retook possession of 
his former carrier, renaming it Laudamotion. If that were not surprising enough, Ryanair went on to secure a 25% 
stake, using it to finally break into the Vienna market. The Irish carrier has since taken 100% ownership of the now-
rebranded Lauda.
Perhaps stung by its failure to acquire Niki, IAG announced it would be ratcheting up its offering at Vienna. Later in 
2018, the airline group created a new Austrian-registered airline, Anisec Luftfahrt, under the parentage of IAG 
subsidiary Vueling. Anisec Luftfahrt became an Austrian branch of Level and started offering leisure focused short-
haul services from the city.
A 'CRAZY' 18 MONTHS
The influx of new low-cost services in Vienna during the summer of 2018 led Wizz chief executive Jozsef Varadi to 
characterise the market as being "a bit of a bloodbath" in an interview with FlightGlobal earlier this year.
And, speaking during a panel debate at the Routes Europe conference in Hannover earlier this month, Vienna 
airport's vice-president of aviation marketing and business development Belina Neumann described the past year-
and-a-half as a "really, really crazy period" for the gateway.
"Things happened very fast. One day you think Lufthansa are going to acquire Niki, the other day you think it's IAG 
group, then you go to bed and, boom, Niki Lauda is back in business. You think you must be dreaming," she said.
Neumann tells FlightGlobal that the immediate result of all this growth was that the number of "Lufthansa monopoly 
routes" decreased. Some trunk routes to destinations such as to Paris, London and Barcelona are now being 
operated by three, four or even five carriers.
The airport calculates that during this summer only two of Lauda's 19 routes from Vienna are monopoly routes. 
Wizz is offering 31 destinations this summer, of which 12 are free of competition.
Neumann also points to data provided by RDC showing that yields on major trunk routes have diminished as 
competition has increased.
Such a situation is unlikely to continue, she argues, warning that airlines are likely to discontinue services in light of 
the intense competition.
One thing that she describes as "absolutely new" is the way in which carriers have marketed and promoted new 
services.
An example she gives is Level offering 0.01 discount fares, taxes included, from Vienna. She says the carrier is 
understood to have sold 35,000 seats in two hours through that promotion.
Wizz, meanwhile, offered winners of a competition the opportunity to fly for free from Vienna to a mystery 
destination.
Such moves have contributed to an across the board surge in passenger numbers at the Viennese gateway, rising 
11% to more than 27 million. Lauda added some 600,000 passengers, EasyJet more than 500,000 and Wizz more 
than 400,000. Austrian grew the most, adding a million passengers during this period, says Neumann.
But while low-cost carriers are growing at a fast rate, Austrian Airlines and the wider Lufthansa Group still remain by 
far the largest player in the market.
Austrian accounted for 47.5% market share, ferrying 12.9 million passengers to and from Vienna in 2018, airport 
data shows. The wider group accounted for 16.9 million passengers, or 63% of the total.
ANALYSIS: Low-cost carriers vie for dominance at Vienna At the beginning of 2018, Vienna International 
airport could count itself among a select group of Europe....
EasyJet and Vueling grew their traffic at the gateway by more than 60%, while Eurowings grew its numbers by 
10%.
It is also interesting to note that, with the exception of Emirates – which saw passenger numbers fall 3.3% – all 
other major carriers operating at Vienna grew their traffic in 2018, suggesting that the budget carriers are 
stimulating new demand rather than just taking share from the incumbents.
Neumann says the airport expects LCCs to account for 25-30% of total passenger traffic this year.
Cirium schedules data shows that by far the biggest destination for carriers operating from Vienna is to Germany, 
representing 19% of the total. This is followed by Italy, Spain and the Canary islands, each with 6.7%, and the UK 
with 5%.
Beyond the low-cost growth, Neumann says Vienna experienced strong growth in the long-haul market. In 2018, 
Thai Airways transported 100,000 passengers to and from Vienna for the first time.
A new Tokyo service operated by ANA will be added this year, and China Southern arrives at the gateway in June.
INCUMBENTS' REACTION
Speaking on the same panel debate at Routes Europe as Neumann, Austrian Airlines' senior director of network 
management Alexandra Goldschmidt said that the Lufthansa Group carrier's initial reaction to the low-cost influx 
was to increase frequencies and aircraft gauges in its core markets.
This was something it had already put in motion following the exit of Air Berlin and Niki, Goldschmidt says, as 
Austrian foresaw untapped demand amid "too little capacity".
She says that today the airline is more present on routes to the German market, for example, as a result.
"[It is] very important to be present on the trunk routes – on the big routes – where there is high demand," she says. 
"You need to be out there with a really good schedule, which does not mean five times a week at different times, [it 
means] at least two or three times a day, maybe even more if there is huge demand."
Goldschmidt says Austrian works closely with its stablemate Eurowings to co-ordinate their schedules and feeder 
options as efficiently as possible. Another key advantage is that the two airlines have strong brand awareness in the 
Vienna market – something both are trying to increase.
"They [the public] can see the offer of the whole group versus a low-cost point-to-point carrier which might not be 
there on a sustainable basis," she adds.
For his part, Heiko Reitz, vice president of network management and airport relations at Eurowings, sees definite 
advantages to "joining forces" with Austrian and exchanging ideas, but the two carriers need to maintain their 
independence.
"There is an overlap definitely, but there is also separate business models that we pursue," he says.
One of EasyJet's first reactions to the new environment was to pull out of its new Milan Malpensa route from Vienna 
during the year.
Bence Szabo, head of network at EasyJet, told Routes delegates in Hannover that the UK budget carrier had 
initially viewed the "Austrian-only" route to Malpensa as looking like a "very healthy" opportunity.
"We launched it and then everything went off in Vienna and suddenly you had Wizz, Level and Eurowings, plus 
Laudamotion, on the route," he recalls. "We just went: 'Wow, what happened there? From a monopoly to five 
airlines?' So we pulled out."
ANALYSIS: Low-cost carriers vie for dominance at Vienna At the beginning of 2018, Vienna International 
airport could count itself among a select group of Europe....
Szabo hints that EasyJet was preoccupied elsewhere in Europe last year as it sought to digest the former Air Berlin 
assets acquired at Berlin Tegel and continued to participate in the privatisation of Alitalia until early in 2019.
WHO WILL WIN?
All the indications suggest that the vicious competition at Vienna is likely to continue unabated for some time. 
EasyJet and Wizz are powerful competitors, while the other low-cost protagonists are backed by large parent 
groups with huge resources to devote to the struggle.
Neumann suggests that the chances of an airline pulling out of the market completely are remote. But who will 
come out on top?
"They are in different situations because Lauda with Ryanair as an owner has the advantage of the market power of 
Ryanair and booking machines at Ryanair – they just switch on and they sell," she says.
Lauda has "more or less" entered markets which its predecessor Nikl specialised in – leisure routes and city 
shuttles.
"For Level, I think it was a little bit more tricky with their background. It's an Austrian company, it has a brand which 
is actually known for long haul, the booking is happening via the Vueling brand, so that is a bit more tricky," 
Neumann adds.
Wizz has done a "great job" in differentiating itself from the competition by developing a "balanced" network that 
draws on the carrier's strength in eastern Europe, while also including western European destinations.
While Vienna's catchment is largely made up of Austrians, Neumann says Wizz is well known among Czechs, 
Slovakians and Hungarians, bestowing a clear advantage.
As regards EasyJet, she believes the carrier needs to "figure out now what they are going to do in Vienna. I think at 
the moment they are kind of observing what everyone is doing and trying to work out what would be the best 
position for them."
Ultimately the struggle will be about who can come out as number two at the airport after Austrian, she says.
NEW RUNWAY
While the high-profile moves by low-cost carriers at Vienna have grabbed the headlines, a crucial legal ruling earlier 
this year was just significant, if not more so, for the airport.
In March, Austria's federal administrative court threw out a legal challenge – based on environmental and noise-
pollution grounds – against the building of a third runway at Vienna.
The ruling brought to an end years of litigation around the planned runway, which has proven controversial with 
environmental groups and local residents.
Neumann says that, following the ruling, Vienna is now hoping to have the new runway completed by 2030 at a cost 
of 1.5 billion ($1.7 billion).
She says the gateway now has to "do its homework" and produce detailed financial studies and other assessment 
reports in order to deliver the new runway.
While Vienna is not particularly slot-constrained at present, with some capacity available even during the peak 
morning periods, a new runway is necessary "if you commit to growth", she says.
As carriers decide to base ever more aircraft at Vienna, the need to develop more infrastructure is growing.
ANALYSIS: Low-cost carriers vie for dominance at Vienna At the beginning of 2018, Vienna International 
airport could count itself among a select group of Europe....
The airport plans to spend a further 2.5 billion on upgrades, excluding the third runway, up to 2028. Those include 
renovation of Terminal 2 and Pier East, and the development of "airport city" real-estate projects such as a recently-
opened office block and health centre.
It's clear that Vienna intends to sustain its momentum in growing traffic and its airline customer base.

Lufthansa loses (EURO)336m in first quarter; Airlines ; Carrier blames cost

Lufthansa has added to worries about the European aviation sector with a profit warning, two weeks after low-cost 
carrier easyJet spooked the market.
In a statement on Monday, the group said rising fuel costs would send it to a worse than expected first-quarter loss, 
prompting its shares to drop 4.4 per cent in early trading yesterday. They recovered to trade flat by mid-morning. 
Lufthansa will report a loss of (EURO)336m in adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the first three months of 
2019, a swing from a profit of (EURO)52m in the same period a year earlier. Median consensus predicted a loss of 
(EURO)186m.
The group blamed a (EURO)202m rise in fuel costs, as well as overcapacity in the highly competitive European 
airline market, which is driving fares down.
It said unit revenues at its legacy airlines - Lufthansa, Swiss and Austrian - and its low-cost Eurowings carrier "were 
down significantly".
However, the company added it "still expects to report an adjusted ebit margin between 6.5 per cent and 8 per 
cent". Airlines have been warning that too many seats are coming on to the market. Europe's overall seat count 
grew 4.8 per cent in the first quarter, according to estimates from Barclays, as airlines tried to deal with demand, but 
this represented a cut from previous plans.
Lufthansa loses (EURO)336m in first quarter Airlines ; Carrier blames cost of fuel and overcapacity in European 
market
Lufthansa will shrink its seats by 1.5 per cent in April, Barclays predicted.
Jet fuel is back up at $84 a barrel, having been as low as $50 two years ago. It spent most of 2018 between $80 
and $90 per barrel and came close to $100 in early October. Towards the end of 2018, Platts, the information 
provider, estimated the high fuel price would cost airlines an additional $50bn that year. Jarrod Castle, UBS analyst, 
said it was clear the winter "was going to be peak supply", but added: "The concern now is less supply and more 
what the demand environment looks like in Europe." He pointed to weakening purchasing managers' indices in the 
eurozone.
Lufthansa's statement followed a similar one this month from easyJet, which said it expected a £275m pre-tax loss 
in its first half-year to March 31. It posted a first-half loss of £212m in 2017, the most recent directly comparable 
period.
EasyJet said it expected costs during the period to have grown 19 per cent because of a high fuel bill and 
investment in spare aircraft, crew and other measures to maintain its schedule in case of summer disruption.
It also blamed "macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions surrounding Brexit" for weaker 
consumer demand.
Ryanair in February said that, unlike competitors, it did not think summer fares would rise this year as it reaffirmed 
its own profit warnings. Mark Manduca, analyst at Citi, pointed to division between network carriers such as 
Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, which were more optimistic about Q2 and Q3 fares, and low-cost carriers, which 
were pessimistic.
Lufthansa will publish its first-quarter results on April 30.

EU Court Dismisses Lufthansa Action On Subsidy For German Airport
EU Court Dismisses Lufthansa Action On Subsidy For German Airport

 An EU court on Friday dismissed a legal action by German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG that contested subsidies 
to Frankfurt-Hahn Airport and contracts it entered into with Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair Holdings PLC.
Lufthansa, which does not use the airport, had failed to show that its business had been negatively affected enough 
to justify its complaint, the EU's General Court ruled.
At issue are subsidies worth millions of euros paid out in previous years. Lufthansa - Europe's largest airline if all its 
subsidiaries are included - alleged unfair competition.
It challenged a 2014 decision by the European Commission to approve the subsidies, on the basis that they were 
not in breach of EU competition rules.
Hahn lies some 120 kilometres from Frankfurt, where Lufthansa has its main hub.
The 2014 decision allowed payments to Hahn airport by Fraport, which operated both Hahn and Frankfurt Airport at 
the time, as well as two German states.
Of the three, only one of the German states - Hesse - still holds a minority share in Hahn. In 2017, China's HNA 
took over 82.5% of the airport.
The commission decided in 2014 that the support for Hahn airport was either not state subsidies or was compliant 
with EU subsidy rules.
Lufthansa said it would consider whether to challenge the decision before the European Court of Justice, the bloc's 
top tribunal.

EU court dismisses Lufthansa action on subsidy for German airport
EU court dismisses Lufthansa action on subsidy for German airport

       LUXEMBOURG (dpa-AFX) - An EU court on Friday dismissed a legal action by German airline Lufthansa that 
contested subsidies to Frankfurt-Hahn Airport and contracts it entered into with Dublin-based budget carrier 
Ryanair.  Lufthansa, which does not use the airport, had failed to show that its business had been negatively 
affected enough to justify its complaint, the European Union's General Court ruled. 
 At issue are subsidies worth millions of euros paid out in previous years. Lufthansa - Europe's largest airline if all 
its subsidiaries are included - alleged unfair competition.  It challenged a 2014 decision by the European 
Commission to approve the subsidies, on the basis that they were not in breach of EU competition rules.  Hahn lies 
some 120 kilometres from Frankfurt, where Lufthansa has its main hub.  The 2014 decision allowed payments to 
Hahn airport by Fraport, which operated both Hahn and Frankfurt Airport at the time, as well as two German states.   
Of the three, only one of the German states - Hesse - still holds a minority share in Hahn. In 2017, China's HNA 
took over 82.5 per cent of the airport.  The commission decided in 2014 that the support for Hahn airport was either 
not state subsidies or was compliant with EU subsidy rules.  Lufthansa said it would consider whether to challenge 
the decision before the European Court of Justice, the bloc's top tribunal.   Copyright dpa

Reckitt Benckiser was the FTSE 100's sharpest faller as Indivior, the drug company that it spun out in 2014, 
crashed by more than 70 per cent.
Indivior said it had been indicted by the US Department of Justice on charges of boosting sales by illicit marketing 
practices since 2010, with the prosecutor seeking damages in excess of $3bn.
The news was a potentially fatal blow for Indivior and would be paralysing for Reckitt, which may pause plans to 
spin off its home care brands until its liabilities were known, said analysts.
Security group G4S jumped after Canadian peer Garda World confirmed it was weighing up a bid for all or part of 
the security services group.
Stagecoach hit its lowest in a decade after the Department for Transport threw the company off all three bid 
shortlists for UK rail franchises, citing its pension liabilities.
Ryanair slipped after Goodbody took the airline off its "buy" list.
Results next month were unlikely to be upbeat given weakening summer season demand, rising fuel prices and

CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: easyJet Posts Warning, Wizz Air Soars
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: easyJet Posts Warning, Wizz Air 
Soars

 Airlines were in the spotlight this week after easyJet guided for a "significantly" widened interim loss and Wizz Air 
said its annual profit will land at the upper end of guidance. 
easyJet started off the week on Monday saying that macroeconomic and Brexit uncertainty would lead to a softer 
second half and a significantly widened interim loss.
For the six months to March-end, easyJet expects to report a headline pretax loss of around GBP275 million due to 
higher costs, fuel and foreign exchange charges. This compares to a headline loss of GBP18 million a year ago.
First-half revenue however is expected to rise 7.3% to GBP2.34 billion.
Looking ahead, the budget airline warned that the second half outlook is now even "more cautious" due to 
macroeconomic uncertainty leading to softness in both the UK and Europe.
Brexit uncertainty did not seem to affect smaller peer Wizz Air however, which on Tuesday reported further traffic 
growth in March and said annual profit would come in towards the top of its guidance.
The central and eastern Europe-focused airline said net profit for the year ended March 31 is expected to come in 
towards the upper half of the EUR270 million and EUR300 million guidance range. A year ago, Wizz Air's net profit 
amounted to EUR275 million.
This was after fourth quarter trading in line with expectations and "robust" demand across the company's key 
geographical territories, Wizz Air explained. 
In March, Wizz Air passenger numbers rose 9.9% to 2.7 million. On a rolling 12 months basis, passenger numbers 
increased 17% to 34.6 million.
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: easyJet Posts Warning, Wizz Air Soars
Meanwhile, another airline heavyweight, Ryanair Holdings, said March passenger numbers rose 9.0% to 10.9 
million. On a rolling annual basis, Ryanair's traffic was also up 9.0% to 142.1 million. 
Elsewhere, trouble continued across the retail sector with data released Friday suggesting that Mother's Day and 
warm spring weather failed to provide respite for the struggling UK high street in March.
A mere 4.8% rise in sales failed to counterbalance last March's dire 10% fall, the BDO's High Street Sales Tracker 
showed.
The latest figures closed a "disastrous" first quarter for the high street, BDO said.
Meanwhile, UK shop prices continued to rise in March, the British Retail Consortium-Nielsen Shop Price Index 
showed on Wednesday, with annual shop price inflation accelerating to 0.9% from 0.7% in February, marking the 
highest inflation rate since 2013.
Some retailers have continued to take advantage of the tough trading climate by hunting for cut-price deals.
FTSE 250 retailer JD Sports Fashion on Thursday bought Oasis singer Liam Gallagher's clothing brand Pretty 
Green out of administration for an undisclosed sum. 
JD Sports will keep the flagship store in Manchester open, but will shut down 11 other stores and 33 concessions, 
putting 97 jobs at risk.
Additionally, last month JD agreed to acquire shoe retailer Footasylum for GBP90.1 million.
Also looking to snap up businesses, Sports Direct International offered to acquire home shopping retailer Findel for 
GBP139.2 million. 
Findel however urged its shareholders to reject Sports Direct proposed takeover as it believes the offer 
"undervalues" the business.
On Monday, Findel received a letter from its second largest shareholder, Schroders Investment Management, 
supporting the company in its rejection of the offer.
Sports Direct's pursuit of taking over struggling department store chain operator Debenhams also continued with 
Sports Direct saying Monday that it has been contacted by a number of Debenhams' shareholders expressing 
support for the sports retailer's board requisition action. 
Sports Direct said Debenhams shareholders expressed concern regarding the protection of their own interests amid 
a refinancing of Debenhams and stated their support for the appointment of Sports Direct's boss Mike Ashley to 
Debenhams board as chief executive.
In March, Sports Direct called for a general meeting of Debenhams to propose Ashley's appointment to the board to 
carry out an executive role. Furthermore, Sports Direct is looking to oust all Debenhams directors bar one.
In a separate attempt to take control of Debenhams, Sports Direct has made a GBP61.4 million bid for the 
department store chain.
Women fashion retailer Bonmarche on Tuesday also found itself as the object of a takeover offer by Spectre 
Holdings Ltd, owned by Edinburgh Woollen Mill billionaire owner Philip Day.
The offer is priced at 11.445 pence per share and values the company at GBP5.7 million, a 34% discount to 
Bonmarche's GBP8.7 million market value Monday's close. 
Meanwhile, on Tuesday Superdry's co-founder and former chief executive Julian Dunkerton narrowly won a 
shareholder vote marking his return to the company's board. 
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: easyJet Posts Warning, Wizz Air Soars
Superdry's shareholders voted in favour of two special resolutions proposed by the retailer's co-founders, which 
resulted in Dunkerton's reappointment and the appointment of Boohoo group's Peter Williams as director.
As a result of the votes, Superdry's Chair Peter Bamford, Chief Executive Euan Sutherland and Chief Financial 
Officer Ed Barker have stepped down with immediate effect, while Non-Executive Directors Dennis Millard, Minnow 
Powell, Sarah Wood and John Smith will leave their roles on July 1.
Finally, the Food retail sector saw Asda kicking out J Sainsbury taking the spot of the second biggest UK 
supermarket by market share, according to figures released by Kantar on Tuesday. 
Asda, in the 12 weeks to March 24, saw sales up by a miniscule 0.1% but reached market share of 15.4%. Over the 
same period, Sainsbury's sales dropped 1.8%, with market share down to 15.3%. 
Wm Morrison Supermarkets was the only other grocer seeing a decline in sales, dipping 0.1%, with its market share 
at 10.3%. Tesco saw sales up 0.5%, but its market share shed 0.2 percentage point to 27.4%. 
Overall, UK supermarkets saw sales up 1.4% year-on-year, the slowest rate in a year due to the later timing of 
Easter and Mother's Day.
A strong performance from its Food division helped Co-operative Group increasing annual pretax profit by 27% to 
GBP93 million. Revenue rose 14% to GBP10.2 billion the company said Friday. 
On Wednesday next week, UK biggest supermarket Tesco is out with its annual results. The grocer is expected to 
show a 22% surge in pretax profit to GBP1.6 billion.
On the same day, another retail heavyweight ASOS will publish its interim results with analysts forecasting a drop in 
profit to GBP3.5 million from GBP27.3 million a year ago.

WHILE the majority of the country will only care about the Grand National tomorrow from a racing perspective, 
punters will be just as interested in the undercard.
The second biggest race of the day is the Ryanair Stayers Hurdle (3.40pm), where Apple's Jade will try to bounce 
back from a disappointing performance in last month's Champion Hurdle.
That was the second year in a row she has disappointed at Prestbury Park, although there was an excuse as she 
scoped dirty after the race.
Prior to that effort she had been absolutely brilliant this season and she is sure to attract plenty of support.
The question you have to ask yourself is whether you're willing to forgive that run just three and a half weeks ago.
At a general 7/4 I'm not and I would rather back Harry Fry's IF THE CAP FITS each-way at 6/1 with Betfair.
Aintree has been the plan for this horse all season, in either this race or the 2m4f Aintree Hurdle yesterday.
In all his runs this season, the son of Milan has shaped like a real stayer and Fry has decided to apply a pair of 
cheekpieces for the first time.
Last time at Fontwell, he raced very lazily and actually did remarkably well to finish as close to Vision Des Flos as 
he did.
The cap will fit perfectly for Fry in Stayers Hurdle BillEsdaile previews the remainder of tomorrow's Aintree 
action ; RACING TRADER
The combination of the step up in trip and headgear may well work the oracle and he is one of very few unexposed 
horses in this field.
Sam Spinner returned to form at Cheltenham, but he has to follow that up here, while Roksana was a fortunate 
winner of the Mares' Hurdle.
The card gets underway with the Gaskells Handicap Hurdle (1.45pm), a hugely competitive 3m½f handicap hurdle.
We won't know the final declara-tions until later this morning, but Gordon Elliott could have a powerful hand with the 
likes of Sire Du Berlais, Dallas Des Pictons and Defi Bleu all entered.
However, we saw at Cheltenham in a number of the handicaps that the cream often rises to the top which draws 
me to the chances of AUX PTIT SOINS.
Dan Skelton's nine-year-old absolutely bolted up in a handicap hurdle at Cheltenham on New Year's Day, a 
performance which saw him sent off just 9/2 for the Cleeve Hurdle.
He disappointed in that, but a mistake two out didn't help and he will appreciate the drop back to handicap 
company.
The Skelton yard continues to fire on all cylinders and 14/1 with Betfair looks a more than fair each-way price.
Lalor has won at this meeting for the last two years, so he has to be greatly respected in the Doom Bar Maghull 
Novices' Chase (3.00pm).
The problem is he ran so badly in the Arkle that it requires a massive leap of faith to back him here at a best price 
4/1 with Coral.
Us And Them stayed on to take second in that race, but I could see one or two having too much speed for him.
I'm hoping one is CLONDAW CASTLE as he travelled brilliantly coming down the hill in the Arkle only to find the 
stamina-sapping climb back up it a bridge too far.
I loved the way he jumped that day and it has to be significant that Tom George is willing to forego a handicap mark 
of 144 for the second time and go for another Grade One.
George's horses are in great form and he tends to do well at this meeting, so Clondaw Castle is the selection at 4/1 
with Ladbrokes. Tim Vaughan won the Betway Handicap Chase (4.20pm) in 2012 with Saint Are and he can repeat 
the trick with DEBECE tomorrow.
The Welsh handler has never hidden his admiration for this horse who was third to The World's End in the Grade 
One Sefton Novices' Hurdle at this meeting two years ago.
He has won two of his three starts over fences and you get the feeling this has been the plan. Take the 9/1 with 
Ladbrokes.
@BillEsdaile POINTERS TOMORROW Aux Ptit Soins e/w 1.45pm Aintree Clondaw Castle 3.00pm Aintree If The 
Cap Fits e/w 3.40pm Aintree Debece e/w 4.20pm Aintree If The Cap Fits should relish the step up in trip in the

RYANAIR's traffic grew nine per cent year-on-year last month as passenger numbers hit 10.9m in March.
Traffic is nine per cent up overall so far this year, with the rolling annual total at 132.1m, up from 130.3m in the year 
to March 2018.
However, growth slowed in comparison to February, when passenger numbers increased by 13 per cent, leading 
shares to dip.
The budget airline swung to a loss in the third quarter of its financial year, blaming the poor performance on weaker 
ticket prices.
Last month, chief executive Michael O'Leary announced he will step back from the day-to-day running of the budget 
airline, giving the company a chance to "reboot".

 Stock prices in London are seen opening higher on Tuesday following a strong close in the US overnight and gains 
in Asian equity markets, as investors reacted positively to US and Chinese manufacturing data released on 
Monday.
In company news, the spat between Provident Financial and Non-Standard Finance took another twist, BHP is 
lowering its iron ore guidance, Ryanair and Wizz Air issued upbeat trading statements, and womenswear retailer 
Bonmarche received a discounted takeover offer.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open up 15.02 points at 7,332.40. The blue-chip index closed up 38.19 
points, or 0.5%, at 7,317.38 on Monday.
Provident Financial said Chief Financial Officer Simon Thomas is to take up to three months leave starting on 
Friday to have a heart operation. Thomas is expected to return to work full time no later than June. The subprime 
lender said Tony Skrzypecki is to be interim CFO.
Provident Financial has been embroiled in a hostile takeover battle with John van Kuffeler's Non-Standard Finance, 
with the two companies trading barbs over the past few months. Van Kuffeler was CEO of Provident between 1991 
to 2013.
Non-Standard Finance said it has received bid acceptances from over 50% of Provident shareholders, but added 
that 90% of acceptances is required for success. 
In response, Provident reiterated its rejection of the Non-Standard Finance offer and said it continues to explore 
alternatives to maximise shareholder value.
Ryanair Holdings reported an increase in traffic for the month of March, with passenger numbers up 9% to 10.9 
million. On a rolling annual basis Ryanair's traffic was up 9% to 142.1 million. 
LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Edinburgh Woolen Mills' Day Bids For Bonmarche
Smaller budget airline Wizz Air Holdings said it expects its annual profit to come in towards the top of its guidance, 
while also reporting traffic growth in March. 
Wizz Air Holdings said trading in the fourth quarter of its financial year ended on Sunday is in line with expectations. 
The central and eastern Europe-focused airline expects to deliver a net annual profit for the year in the upper half of 
its guidance range of between EUR270 million and EUR300 million. 
HSBC took a downbeat view of the airline sector, downgrading its ratings on easyJet, Ryanair and Wizz Air to Hold 
from Buy. 
Irish building materials firm CRH said it completed the fourth phase of its share buyback programme, returning a 
further EUR200 million of cash to shareholders. The company added that this brings total cash returned to 
shareholders under our share buyback programme to approximately EUR1 billion over the last 12 months.
CRH added that further share buybacks are "under active consideration".
Construction firm Galliford Try said it signed an agreement with Homes England to build more than 850 homes 
across the UK.
The housebuilder said the partnership will deliver housing across key sites in Redcar, Cheshire, Staffordshire and 
Dorset. The homes will be constructed as part of Homes England's initiative to build new housing at pace. 
Construction work will begin on the projects immediately with the first planning applications due to be submitted 
later in April and the first homes expected to be completed in spring 2020.
Miner BHP Group will be reviewing its 2019 production guidance following disruption caused by Cyclone Veronica 
in Australia.
The storm has not caused any major damage at Port Hedland in Western Australia, BHP said, but flooding has 
hampered the movement of trains. As a result, Port Hedland, part of BHP's iron ore arm, is operating at a reduced 
rate and will continue to do so until later in April.
BHP said an early estimate of the impact will see 2019 production fall by around 6 million to 8 million tonnes, and it 
is also reviewing unit cost guidance. A further update will be provided after further work is carried out, it said.
Spectre Holdings, a Dubai-registered company 100% owned by Edinburgh Woolen Mill owner Philip Day, has made 
a mandatory cash offer for clothing retailer Bonmarche after taking a 52.4% stake. The offer values Bonmarche at 
GBP5.7 million, against its GBP8.7 million current market value. Spectre pointed to a significant decline in 
Bonmarche's profitability and said it could offer advice and support.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index ended flat. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 0.7%, while the Hang Seng 
index in Hong Kong is up 0.2%.
In the US on Monday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite 
both up 1.3%, while the S&P 500 ended 1.2% higher.
"Rebounding US manufacturing helped US shares advance at the start of the new quarter. The S&P 500 surged to 
its highest level since October while stocks across Asia also rallied on Tuesday, setting European indices up for a 
positive start," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler.

The world’s largest flightcrew instruction company, CAE, says the training industry is theoretically capable of 
churning out licensed pilots in sufficient numbers to meet unprecedented future airline demands. But, it says, 
attracting suitable candidates in sufficient numbers is going to be a challenge, and a lack of affordable finance for 
training is a large part of the problem.
CAE’s global head of standards, David Owens, observes that many of today’s potential pilots “are not applying for 
the reasons we did”. By that he means today’s applicants for pilot training are more likely to be hard-nosed and 
practical about the skills they will invest in, and will investigate what return they can expect from the investment.
Ryanair calculates that the outlay for a three-year university degree is less than one-third of the cost of pilot training. 
Meanwhile university courses are propped up by grants, government-backed low-interest loans and tax 
concessions, but this does not always extend to investors in a pilot qualification.
The Europe-based Air Training Policy Group (ATPG) says the ability to find suitable finance is “the largest 
discriminator in pilot career choice”, and points out that this factor limits the pool of talent that the industry can 
recruit from.
CAE Civil Aviation Training Solutions was invited to present on future pilot supply at the 5th Airports Council 
International (ACI)-World Bank annual aviation symposium in London from 12-14 March. The airports trade body 
says it wants “a data-driven understanding of potential demand and various scenarios [to give] aviation 
stakeholders insights for effective decision-making”.
demand PUSH
XxMoney matters Xxx Changing career attitudes and dramatic growth in the world airline fleet point to a severe 
shortage of flightcrew - but the cost of earning ....
Global airport passenger traffic, says ACI, is “poised to double in less than 20 years and over the long term it is 
projected to grow at an annualised rate of 4.1%, reaching 20.9 billion by 2040”. Passenger number increases may 
not be precisely reflected in fleet growth as the average aircraft unit grows slightly larger. But regardless, a drive to 
make more efficient use of a growing fleet will increase the number of crews needed; if aircraft spend more time in 
the air and less on the ground, pilots’ flight time limitations become a pressing concern.
However, ACI continues: “With a shift away from liberalised economic policies, how can we quantify the downside 
risks to air transport demand amid sanctioned trade wars and ongoing geopolitical tensions? On the other hand, 
based on ‘business as usual’ traffic projections, what are the supply-side considerations, capacity constraints and 
bottlenecks that we face?”
Perhaps it is the latter question that CAE was invited to answer.
Before the conference, ACI director general Angela Gittens said the intention was to “detail the risks and 
opportunities for global lenders and investors in the airport industry”, adding: “Participants can expect valuable 
analyses of global and regional economic forces that airport executives and investors need to understand.”
For the commercial air transport industry to work, it needs infrastructure, aircraft, finance and skilled personnel. The 
infrastructure may be capacity constrained, but it is there. The manufacturers are churning out the necessary 
aircraft. The finance is readily there for the infrastructure and aircraft, but the missing piece of the jigsaw is skilled 
personnel.
The supply of the latter, and finance to enable it, is not guaranteed, so it could bring down all the rest. The 
manufacturers know there is no point building aircraft when there are insufficient pilots to crew them. Talk of single-
pilot cockpits for commercial passenger aircraft was a livelier topic three years ago than it is now, so a technological 
solution to the pilot shortage appears many years away. A struggling commercial air transport industry will 
profoundly affect the global economy. That is why ACI and the World Bank talk to each other.
GATHERING PACE
It was Owens, on behalf of CAE, who addressed the ACI-World Bank symposium. His presentation was headed: 
“Developing better pilots, faster”. That headline may be what the audience hoped to hear, but in September last 
year at the Royal Aeronautical Society’s International Flight Crew Training Conference, there was general 
agreement that training quality could be improved – but not delivered in a shorter time than at present.
Outside the corporate environment Owens admits: “We can’t short-cut experience.” But CAE’s plan to accelerate 
pilot progress through training depends heavily on attracting and selecting the right material so as not to lose 
instructor time on remedial training for struggling stragglers. There does not seem to be any co-ordinated industry 
plan for attracting more interest in industry careers, however.
Meanwhile, the airline pilot training industry worldwide faces a perfect storm of competing demands. The rapidly 
growing world fleet and massive order backlogs at aircraft manufacturers are driving an unprecedented global 
demand for fully trained crews.
CAE says that in 2018 there were 305,000 active airline pilots and 55,000 business aviation pilots. Between now 
and 2028, the number of those that will need to be replaced because of retirement is respectively 110,000 and 
40,000. CAE calculates that one-third of active pilots are aged over 50. But in addition, fleet growth will add the 
need for 160,000 more airline pilots and 10,000 extra business aviation pilots.
By 2028, the numbers of active pilots, therefore, will be 465,000 airline pilots and 65,000 business pilots – adding 
up to a grand total of more than half a million active professional pilots.
At the same time, air training organisations (ATO) are under pressure – or even under compulsion in the case of the 
European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) – to implement new training paradigms. These new ways of 
XxMoney matters Xxx Changing career attitudes and dramatic growth in the world airline fleet point to a severe 
shortage of flightcrew - but the cost of earning ....
delivering training include competency-based training and assessment (CBTA) at the ab initio level and evidence-
based training for airline recurrent training.
Under today’s performance-based regulation system, ATO and airline training departments now have the 
responsibility to design the instruction programmes they will use to produce the defined competencies in the 
students, and they must have these programmes approved by their national aviation authorities (NAA). At the same 
time, widespread underinvestment in NAA means many authorities are unable to provide the guidance and 
oversight needed at a time of change combined with high demand. Owens concedes that the oversight required for 
CBTA is “more sophisticated” than it was for the old syllabus-based courses.
Instructors need time to prepare for the different kind of instructional approach they need to adopt to deliver CBTA 
and to change recurrent training from an adversarial testing process to sessions aimed at fostering learning and 
improvement in crews. Instructors now need to be facilitators in the learning process, rather than pushing trainees 
towards a test pass. As EASA has observed regarding recurrent training: “When training is combined with the 
checking programme, too little time is available for training.”
A dearth of instructors, especially good ones, has always been something of a problem, but according to 
projections, it will grow worse. A higher demand for pilots will push up airline pay, so unless instructor pay keeps 
pace, there will be an exodus to the airlines. And if quality is to be maintained and improved, instructors need to be 
retained.
The ATPG is putting pressure on EASA to simplify instructor categorisation to make the best use of existing airline 
talent and experience. The group provides just one example of how the existing system makes poor use of 
experience: if an airline captain/instructor with 30 or more years of experience and a type rating instructor simulator 
qualification loses his medical certificate but is capable of continuing to do his simulator teaching, the present 
system downgrades him to a synthetic flight instructor, explains the ATPG. He is still allowed to teach students in a 
simulator, but unable to train new instructors, meaning his 30 years of experience are no longer fully utilised.
QUALITY CONCERNS
Gerda Pardatscher, senior expert flight crew licensing (FCL) in EASA’s aircrew and medical standards 
implementation section, says that, as demand begins to exceed supply, those licensed pilots who have previously 
been turned down for airline jobs will be back on the market, perhaps with a realistic prospect of being hired. 
Ryanair’s experience of recruiting from the pool of licensed pilots was that 40% did not meet its own basic entry 
requirements, and after further losses among those who made it as far as a simulator check, the overall pass rate 
was 35%.
Quality is a real issue, because recent years have shown that something is missing from training in the way it has 
traditionally been delivered – especially on today’s digital flightdecks. EASA’s flightcrew training oversight chief, 
Georges Rebender, says that, for EASA, the penny finally dropped after the 2009 loss of Air France flight 447 – an 
Airbus A330 – over the South Atlantic. But there had already been two decades before that in which loss of control 
in flight emerged as the big threat at a time when most other risks were decreasing.
EASA’s “new paradigm” for flight training, which is due to be in place across the EU and EASA-contracting states 
by 31 January 2022, came out of an agency training needs analysis driven by data from the airline industry, starting 
in 2013. One of the input sources was the ATPG, a consultative body of airline training chiefs and EASA FCL 
specialists.
They all agreed that there seemed to be a problem among many new pilots – and even among some who had 
accumulated some airline experience: they could assimilate enough aviation knowledge to pass exams, but did not 
understand it well enough to apply it to the operating environment. According to Andy O’Shea, Ryanair head of 
training and chairman of the ATPG, one of the principal factors enabling unsuitable candidates to get through the 
system on minimum standards, and still end up with a licence, is failure to undergo a pre-course aptitude 
assessment.
XxMoney matters Xxx Changing career attitudes and dramatic growth in the world airline fleet point to a severe 
shortage of flightcrew - but the cost of earning ....
The ATPG has set out the requirements for a sustainable system that has a chance of providing sufficient high-
quality pilots for the industry’s future needs. The first step is to attract high-ability candidates by making a pilot 
career path – not just a job – visible and attractive to young people early in education.
When they have applied, the next step is to put them through an independent pre-training assessment process. 
Those who pass the assessment are to be organised access to affordable finance because they are highly likely to 
pass. When they have completed the course successfully – and fully assessed pilots have a greater than 90% 
chance of doing so – they are employed immediately by an airline.
Pre-assessment is the key to a sustainable supply system, because if the training cost is borne by a student who 
has no guarantee of graduating, let alone of a job, finance for the course becomes difficult or impossible. Indeed the 
ATPG directs a hint strongly at the European Commission, suggesting that if it were to enable affordable financing 
for pilot students, it would also advance its social equity and mobility objectives.
collaboration required
If industry and government were more mutually supportive in the generation of aviation skills, the worries about 
future supply of pilot and other skills would not be so acute. For example, the UK government’s green paper entitled 
“Aviation 2050: The Future of UK Aviation” does not even mention training and the provision of skills.
Meanwhile, the Aviation Skills Partnership (ASP), a private initiative begun nearly six years ago in the UK to pull 
together the components of an unco-ordinated aviation skills supply system, has just been acquired by 
Cheltenham-based specialist engineering training services group Pennant International. ASP itself covers all 
aviation skills paths to employment, from pilots and cabin crew to engineering and airport services.
It helps to present aviation, both civil and military, as a prospective career to young people at school and direct 
them to organisations that can channel their enthusiasm and guide them into training.
This effort has included starting the first pilot degree course available in the country, persuading the government to 
treat the acquisition of aviation skills as a tax-deductible, student-loan-attracting form of training, and providing 
training academies in association with local councils and the military.
In most countries, an effective system of co-ordination across the airline industry and working with governments, 
NAA and the education system to generate interest in the acquisition of aviation skills does not exist. So if the pilot 
shortage becomes acute, the industry mainly has itself to blame.

GAINS in miners and banks propelled London's main bourse higher yesterday, as sentiment picked up after 
surprisingly upbeat data from China and progress in USChina trade talks, while Easyjet's bleak forecast triggered 
an airline stocks sell-off.
The FTSE 100 ended 0.5 per cent higher after rallying as much as one per cent with gains capped due to investors 
shunning defensive stocks, and the midcaps added 0.6 per www.cent.UK markets joined a global rally sparked by 
data showing Chinese factory activity grew for the first time in four months in March.
Also driving sentiment was a survey that showed UK manufacturing growth at an unexpected 13-month high last 
month as the country stockpiles for Brexit.
Miners jumped 2.5 per cent to a 10-month high as base metals prices rose, including nickel after data suggested 
stimulus measures in China, the world's biggest nickel consumer, were boosting the economy.
Trade progress and reassurance about the Chinese economy also helped Asia-exposed stocks such as HSBC and 
Stanchart.
All but two sectors in the FTSE 100 were in positive territory, with Easyjet's weak trading update the biggest 
negative.
WPP, the world's biggest advertising group, added three per cent on its best day in a month after a Deutsche Bank 
rating upgrade.
Easyjet, by contrast, suffered a 10 per cent slump on its worst day in nearly three years after it flagged soft ticket 
pricing, partly due to Brexit uncertainties. Easyjet's cautious tone brought down shares in British Airways-owner 
IAG, Wizz Air and the London-listed shares of Ryanair by between 2 and 4.3 per cent.

Defensive stocks, which are deemed safer at times of uncertainty, underperformed. British American Tobacco and 
Imperial Brands were among the worst fallers, while United Utilities, SSE and National Grid also weakened.

EasyJet warned of worsening first-half losses amid higher costs and Brexit uncertainty, prompting a near 10 per 
cent share price plunge.
The company said yesterday it expected its pre-tax loss in the six months to March 31 to deepen to £275m from 
£212m in the same period a year earlier.
The trading update comes as Europe's low-cost carriers are buffeted by higher fuel costs, declining seat prices as 
capacity expands and economic jitters across the region.
Shares in easyJet were down 9.7 per cent to £10.09 yesterday, dragging down rivals such as Ryanair, which 
dropped 4.7 per cent, and British Airways owner IAG, which fell 1.6 per cent.
The airline said it had become "more cautious" on the next six months, with revenue per seat expected to be only 
"slightly up" as a year-on-year rise in demand for the crucial July-September period is offset by weakness in the 
preceding quarter.
The update suggests easyJet will struggle to achieve the full-year pre-tax profit of £580m it was indicating as 
recently as January.
EasyJet hit by rising costs and Brexit jitters; Airlines
Johan Lundgren, chief executive, said the company was seeing "softness" in both the UK and Europe for the six 
months to the end of September because "macroeconomic uncertainty and many unanswered questions 
surrounding Brexit" were "driving weaker customer demand".
He said this was the case in "all our core European markets" as economic prospects had declined in the UK, Italy 
and France, adding that while the UK domestic market was "doing OK", international flights to and from the country 
were suffering. He said he hoped clarity on Brexit would lead hesitant consumers to book flights.
EasyJet said it expected revenue per seat in its first half to have declined by 7.4 per cent, in line with its January 
guidance. Overall, first-half revenue was expected to have grown about 7.3 per cent to £2.34bn, thanks to higher 
passenger numbers.
The company said that it expected costs during the period to have risen 19 per cent because of a high fuel bill and 
investment in spare aircraft, crew and other measures to maintain its schedule in case of summer disruption. See

Ryanair pilots in Portugal vote for pay agreement

Irish-based carrier Ryanair said on Tuesday its pilots based in Portugal have voted for a labour agreement for the 
next four years, taking another step to head off any risk of another round of damaging strikes ahead of its peak 
summer season.
The agreement governing pay and conditions was negotiated between Ryanair and the Portuguese pilot union 
SPAC to cover all of the airline's directly employed pilots in Portugal, the carrier said.
Ryanair has been struggling with labour relations since it bowed to pressure to recognise unions for the first time 
almost a year ago.
The airline had said in October that it had reached an agreement with its Portuguese pilots on seniority and home 
base issues, looking at the time to end a damaging series of strikes that had hurt its business.
It had said that the Portuguese deal - covering issues such as leave allocation and promotion - would allow talks 
with Portugal's SPAC union on a full collective labour agreement.
Separately, Ryanair said on Tuesday that passenger traffic grew 9% to 10.9 million in March. (Reuters)

EasyJet Sounds Note of Caution for Second Half After Saying First-Half Headline Loss in Line With Guidance
EasyJet Sounds Note of Caution for Second Half After Saying First-Half 
Headline Loss in Line With Guidance

 British budget airline easyJet (EZJ.L) forecast early Monday that it sees "softness in both the UK and Europe" in 
the fiscal second half, after saying the company expects to report a headline loss before tax in the first six months 
of the financial year, albeit in line with expectations.
Even though total sales during the six months that ended March 31 are expected to grow by about 7.3% to 2.34 
billion pounds ($3.05) with seat capacity up by 14.5%, the carrier noted that revenue per seat at constant currency 
is set to decline by 7.4%, according to a trading statement. That result is also in line with its guidance of a mid-to-
high single-digit drop in turnover for the first half.
The carrier said it expected "positive" underlying revenue to be offset by Easter moving into the second half as well 
as the dilutive impact of flying at Berlin Tegel and the prior year, strong-comparator impacts from the collapse of a 
British rival Monarch and tens of thousands of flight cancellations at Ryanair.
easyJet further pointed out that total headline cost in the first half is also expected to surge by about 18.8% due to 
increased capacity, higher fuel unit costs and a modest increase in cost per seat excluding fuel. It, however, noted 
that headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency is expected to increase by 1.4%, in line with 
expectations.
"Whilst easyJet will deliver H1 [first half] results in line with expectations, macroeconomic uncertainty and many 
unanswered questions surrounding Brexit are together driving weaker customer demand in the market such that we 
are seeing increasing softness in ticket yields in the UK and across Europe," the statement added. "Given this 
uncertainty, our outlook for H2 [second half] is now more cautious."
The carrier added that the European Union Parliament has passed its air connectivity legislation and together with 
the UK's confirmation that it will reciprocate, the implication is that "whatever happens, we'll be flying as usual."

The world's largest flightcrew instruction company, CAE, believes the training industry is theoretically capable of 
churning out licensed pilots in sufficient numbers to meet unprecedented future airline demands. But, it warns, 
attracting suitable candidates in sufficient numbers is going to be a challenge, and a lack of affordable finance for 
training is a large part of the problem.
CAE's global head of standards David Owens observes that many of today's potential pilots "are not applying for 
the reasons we did". By this he means that today's applicants for pilot training are more likely to be hard-nosed and 
practical about the skills they will invest in, and will investigate what return they can expect from the investment.
Ryanair calculates that the outlay for a three-year university degree is less than one-third of the cost of pilot training. 
Meanwhile university courses are propped up by grants, government-backed low-interest loans and tax 
concessions, but this does not always extend to investors in a pilot qualification.
The Europe-based Air Training Policy Group (ATPG) says the ability to find suitable finance is "the largest 
discriminator in pilot career choice", and points out that this factor limits the pool of talent that the industry can 
recruit from.
CAE Civil Aviation Training Solutions was invited to present on future pilot supply at the 5th Airports Council 
International-World Bank annual aviation symposium in London from 12-14 March. Airports trade body ACI says it 
wants "a data-driven understanding of potential demand and various scenarios [to give] aviation stakeholders 
insights for effective decision-making".

Global airport passenger traffic, says ACI, is "poised to double in less than 20 years... and over the long term it is 
projected to grow at an annualised rate of 4.1%, reaching 20.9 billion by 2040". Passenger-number increases may 
not be precisely reflected in fleet growth as the average aircraft unit gets slightly larger. But regardless, a drive to 
make more efficient use of a growing fleet will increase the number of crews needed; if aircraft spend more time in 
the air and less on the ground, flight-time limitations mean more crews will be needed.
However, ACI continues: "With a shift away from liberalised economic policies, how can we quantify the downside 
risks to air transport demand amid sanctioned trade wars and ongoing geopolitical tensions? On the other hand, 
based on 'business as usual' traffic projections, what are the supply-side considerations, capacity constraints and 
bottlenecks that we face?"

Perhaps it is the latter question that CAE was invited to answer.
Before the conference, ACI director general Angela Gittens said the intention was to "detail the risks and 
opportunities for global lenders and investors in the airport industry", adding: "Participants can expect valuable 
analyses of global and regional economic forces that airport executives and investors need to understand."
For the commercial air transport industry to work, it needs infrastructure, aircraft, finance and skilled personnel. The 
infrastructure may, in parts, be capacity-constrained, but it is there. The manufacturers are churning out the 
necessary aircraft. The finance is readily there for the infrastructure and aircraft, but the missing piece of the jigsaw 
is skilled personnel.
The supply of the latter, and finance to enable it, is not guaranteed, so it could bring down all the rest. The 
manufacturers know there is no point building aircraft when there are insufficient pilots to crew them. Talk of single-
pilot cockpits for commercial passenger aircraft was a livelier topic three years ago than it is now, so a technological 
solution to the pilot shortage appears many years away. A struggling commercial air transport industry will 
profoundly affect the global economy. That is why the ACI and the World Bank talk to each other.
GATHERING PACE
It was Owens, on behalf of CAE, who addressed the ACI-World Bank symposium. His presentation was headed: 
"Developing better pilots, faster". That headline may be what the audience hoped to hear, but in September last 
year at the Royal Aeronautical Society's International Flight Crew Training Conference there was general 
agreement that training quality could be improved, but not delivered in a shorter time than at present.
Outside the corporate environment Owens admits: "We can't short-cut experience." But CAE's plan to accelerate 
pilot progress through training depends heavily on attracting and selecting the right material so as not to lose 
instructor time on remedial training for struggling stragglers. There does not seem to be any co-ordinated industry 
plan for attracting more interest in industry careers, however.
Meanwhile, the airline pilot training industry worldwide faces a perfect storm of competing demands. The rapidly 
growing world fleet and massive order backlogs at aircraft manufacturers are driving an unprecedented global 
demand for fully trained crews.
CAE says that in 2018 there were 305,000 active airline pilots and 55,000 business aviation pilots. Between now 
and 2028, the number of those that will need to be replaced because of retirement is respectively 110,000 and 
40,000. CAE calculates that one-third of active pilots are aged over 50. But in addition, fleet growth will add the 
need for 160,000 more airline pilots and 10,000 extra business aviation pilots. By 2028, the numbers of active 
pilots, therefore, will be 465,000 airline pilots and 65,000 business pilots, making a grand total of more than half a 
million active professional pilots.

At the same time, air training organisations (ATOs) are under pressure – or even under compulsion in the case of 
the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) – to implement new training paradigms. These new ways of 
delivering training include competency-based training and assessment (CBTA) at the ab initio training level, and 
evidence-based training (EBT) for airline recurrent training.
Under today's performance-based regulation (PBR) system, ATOs and airline training departments now have the 
responsibility to design the instruction programmes they will use to produce the defined competencies in the 
students, and they must have these programmes approved by their national aviation authorities (NAAs). At the 
same time, widespread underinvestment in NAAs means many authorities are unable to provide the guidance and 
oversight needed at a time of change combined with high demand. Owens concedes that the oversight required for 
CBTA is "more sophisticated" than it was for the old syllabus-based courses.
Instructors need time to prepare for the different kind of instructional approach they need to adopt to deliver CBTA 
and to change recurrent training from an adversarial testing process to sessions aimed at fostering learning and 
improvement in crews. Instructors now need to be facilitators in the learning process, rather than pushing trainees 
towards a test pass. As EASA has observed regarding recurrent training: "When training is combined with the 
checking programme, too little time is available for training."
A dearth of instructors, especially good ones, has always been something of a problem, but according to 
projections, it will grow worse. A higher demand for pilots will push up airline pay, so unless instructor pay keeps 
pace, there will be an exodus to the airlines. And if quality is to be maintained and improved, instructors need to be 
retained.
The ATPG is putting pressure on EASA to simplify instructor categorisation to make the best use of existing airline 
talent and experience. The group provides just one example of how the existing system makes poor use of 
experience: if an airline captain/instructor with 30 or more years of experience and a type rating instructor (TRI) 
simulator qualification loses his medical certificate but is capable of continuing to do his simulator teaching, the 
present system downgrades him to a Synthetic Flight Instructor (SFI), explains the ATPG. He is still allowed to 
teach students in a simulator, but unable to train new instructors, meaning his 30 years of experience are no longer 
fully utilised.
QUALITY CONCERNS
Gerda Pardatscher, senior expert Flight Crew Licensing (FCL) in EASA’s aircrew and medical standards 
implementation section, says that, as demand begins to exceed supply, those licensed pilots who have previously 
been turned down for airline jobs will be back on the market, perhaps with a realistic prospect of being hired. 
Ryanair's experience of recruiting from the pool of licensed pilots was that 40% did not meet its own basic entry 
requirements, and after further losses among those who made it as far as a simulator check, the overall pass rate 
was 35%.

Quality is a real issue, because recent years have proved that something is missing from training in the way it has 
traditionally been delivered – especially on today's digital flightdecks. EASA’s flightcrew training oversight chief, 
Georges Rebender, says that, for EASA, the penny finally dropped after the 2009 loss of Air France flight 447 – an 
Airbus A330 – over the South Atlantic. But there had already been two decades before that in which loss of control 
in flight (LOC-I) emerged as the big threat at a time when most other risks were decreasing.
EASA's "new paradigm" for flight training, which is due to be in place across the EU and EASA-contracting states 
by 31 January 2022, came out of an agency training needs analysis driven by data from the airline industry, starting 
in 2013. One of the input sources was the ATPG, a consultative body of airline training chiefs and EASA FCL 
specialists.

They all agreed that there seemed to be a problem among many new pilots – and even among some who had 
accumulated some airline experience: they could assimilate enough aviation knowledge to pass exams, but did not 
understand it well enough to apply it to the operating environment. According to Andy O’Shea, Ryanair head of 
training and chairman of the ATPG, one of the principal factors enabling unsuitable candidates to get through the 
system on minimum standards, and still end up with a licence, is failure to undergo a pre-course aptitude 
assessment.
The ATPG has set out the requirements for a sustainable system that has a chance of providing sufficient high-
quality pilots for the industry's future needs. The first step is to attract high-ability candidates by making a pilot 
career path – not just a job – visible and attractive to young people early in education.
When they have applied, the next step is to put them through an independent pre-training assessment process. 
Those who pass the assessment are be organised access to affordable finance because they are highly likely to 
pass. When they have completed the course successfully – and fully assessed pilots have a greater than 90% 
chance of doing so – they are employed immediately by an airline.
Pre-assessment is the key to a sustainable supply system, because if the training cost is borne by a student who 
has no guarantee of graduating, let alone of a job, finance for the course becomes difficult or impossible. Indeed the 
ATPG directs a hint strongly at the European Commission, suggesting that if it were to enable affordable financing 
for pilot students, it would advance its social equity and mobility objectives.

If industry and government were more mutually supportive in the generation of aviation skills, the worries about 
future pilot and other skills supplies would not be so acute. For example the UK government's green paper entitled 
Aviation 2050: The Future of UK Aviation does not even mention training and the provision of skills.
Meanwhile the Aviation Skills Partnership, a private initiative begun nearly six years ago in the UK to pull together 
the components of an uncoordinated aviation skills supply system, has just been acquired by Cheltenham-based 
specialist engineering training services group Pennant International Group. ASP itself covers all aviation skills paths 
to employment, from pilots and cabin crew to engineering and airport services. It helps to present aviation, both civil 
and military, as a prospective career to young people at school and direct them to organisations that can channel 
their enthusiasm and guide them into training. This effort has included starting the first pilot degree course available 
in the country, persuading the government to treat the acquisition of aviation skills as a tax-deductible, student-loan-
attracting form of training, and providing training academies in association with local councils and the military.
In most countries, an effective system of co-ordination across the airline industry, working with governments, NAAs 
and the education system to generate interest in the acquisition of aviation skills does not exist. So if the pilot 
shortage becomes acute, the industry mainly has itself to blame.

Highlight: UK stock market follows Asia higher after strong factory output data from China and pound recovers as 
traders bet on soft Brexit but Easyjet falters after cautious trading statement.
Body
The UK stock market followed Asia higher after strong factory output data from China and progress in its trade talks 
with the US cheered investors.
On currency markets the pound jumped 0.6% against the dollar to $1.311 as traders bet that that today's votes in 
Parliament on various Brexit options would likely lead to a soft Brexit. 
On Friday sterling dropped below $1.30 after the House of Commons rejected the prime minister's withdrawal deal 
for a third time, leaving Theresa May in office but at the mercy of different factions in the Conservative party.
Brexit uncertainty battered EasyJet (EZJ) with shares in the budget airline dropping nearly 7% as it warned of 
higher fuel costs and a fall in travellers in the coming months.
Overall, the market was positive with the FTSE 100 advancing 43 points, or 0.6%, to 7,323 as manufacturing data 
from China indicated the government’s stimulus package was boosting the economy, countering recent slowdown 
fears.
Miners led gains on the UK’s main market thanks to a rise in the price of base metals, including nickel, of which 
China is the biggest consumer. Rio Tinto (RIO) rose 2.8% to £45.87, BHP Group (BHP) 3% to £19.05 and 
Glencore (GLEN) climbed 3.2% to 328p.
Progress in US-China trade talks, meanwhile, lifted Asia-exposed financials bank HSBC (HBSA) and Prudential 
(PRU) up 1.4% to 632.2p and 1.7% to £15.64 respectively.
‘The speed of expansion is still fairly low – the PMI index for manufacturing stood at 50.8 and 50 is the cut off point 
for expansion – but with China being the key market for several European indices a stronger manufacturing number 
means a return to higher exports,’ said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.
EasyJet shares tumbled 8% to £10.27 after its first half trading statement.
Strong China data lifts FTSE, pound leaps on Brexit hopes
‘Fuel can be forward-bought but ultimately management are still at the mercy of oil price movements,’ said AJ Bell 
investment director Russ Mould. ‘The weather is another unpredictable factor and it is now clear that Brexit 
uncertainty has been added to the list.’
‘As such, it seems highly likely that EasyJet won’t be the only airline to moan about weaker prices, and indeed the 
tour operators are certainly not in comfortable territory as they face the same headwinds.’
British Airways owner IAG (IAG) slipped 1.7% to 503p and Dublin-listed Ryanair (RYA) shed 3.8% to €11.3 in 
response.
WPP (WPP) was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, as shares in the advertising group rose 3.9% to 842p, following 
a ratings upgrade from Deutsche Bank.
Royal Mail (RMG) rallied 2% to 243p after broker Berenberg upped its rating to 'hold' from 'sel'.
An early rally in mid-cap stocks faded with the FTSE 250 up 16 points to 19,133. The FTSE Small Cap did better, 
hanging on to a 0.6% or 31 point gain to 5,497.
Debenhams (DEB) slid 1.8% to 2.6p as Sports Direct (SPD) said its shareholders expressed support for 
appointing the sportswear retailer’s boss Mike Ashley as the chain’s chief executive.

THE COLLAPSE of Iceland's budget carrier Wow Air will come as little surprise to aviation wonks. It follows the 
demise of UK staple Monarch, Primera Air, Air Berlin, FlyBmi and Germania - which last month filed for bankruptcy. 
Other carriers such as Alitalia, Norwegian and Flybe limp on in various states of distress. Flybe is proceeding with 
its sale to Virgin-led consortium Connect Airways, which values the airline at just over £2m, while Norwegian 
chairman Bjorn Kise this week said he would stand down as the airline grapples with lost share value. The tale of 
the airline industry's woes comes down to a capacity problem: too many seats on offer sold for next to nothing. At 
the same time, fuel costs have recovered substantially in the past three years, making the industry's razor-thin 
margins even more elusive. What's more, airlines are operating at a time when the global economy appears to be 
slowing, thanks to trade tensions, Brexit and a sluggish Eurozone. But it is not just budget airlines struggling. 
Legacy carriers are feeling it too, overstretching themselves by investing in their premium offer but offering no-frills 
for economy class flyers to make sure jets are full. Low-cost carriers will need to learn how to distinguish 
themselves from budget heavyweights Ryanair and Easyjet, or they could be next.

BERLIN (AP) - A German labor union says it has reached a deal on pay and conditions for about 1,100 Ryanair 
cabin crew.
The ver.di union said Wednesday that the deal will see Ryanair employees and contractors based in Germany 
receive 600 euros ($676) more in basic pay each month and separate increases of up to 250 euros.
The union says the budget airline has also agreed to give employees a minimum number of flight hours and apply 
German labor laws that ensure sick pay and packages for staff who are let go.
Christine Behle, a member of the union's board, said the deal will "stop the extremely precarious working 
conditions" at Ryanair.
The airline declined to comment on the agreement. Negotiations having workers' representatives in the company 
are still ongoing.

Agreement has been reached with Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair on a pay deal for 1,100 cabin crew 
stationed in Germany, services union Verdi announced in Berlin on Wednesday.
Cabin crew are to receive an additional 600 euros (680 dollars) a month in basic pay, additional supplements of up 
to 250 euros and social arrangements on being transferred, the union said.
There was no immediate comment from Ryanair, which has traditionally been hostile to unionization among its staff.
German labour law was being implemented on behalf of the Germany-based staff for the first time, Verdi executive 
member Christine Behle said. She noted there was as yet no agreement on setting up a works council of the kind 
usual in larger German companies.
In December, Ryanair and Germany's Cockpit pilots' union (VC) agreed on the major points of a settlement in their 
pay dispute, averting strike action ahead of the Christmas holiday season.
The more than 400 Ryanair pilots stationed in Germany had previously gone on strike, stopping work three times 
over the course of 2018.

Mar 26, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair 
passengers on a flight from Stansted Airport, London, to Fuerteventura, Spain, broke into loud applause, Monday, 
after a drunk,unruly woman and her partner were removed from the plane by security personnel. The flight, which 
departed from London at 6:20 a.m. local time (2:20 a.m. EDT), was relatively uneventful till 20 minutes of being up 
in the air. At that point, one of the passengers asked a woman sitting in front to calm down. 
The woman, who was reportedly drunk, started to argue with thepassenger. When things got heated, a flight 
attendant approached the scene and asked the passenger sitting next to the woman to relocate, considering the 
person's safety. Rahma Salmin, 22, who was present on the flight at the time and witnessed the entire incident, told 
Mail Online[1] that as the plane started to descend, the woman started screaming and her partner started making 
nonsensical comments. 'There was a drunk couple on our flight from Stansted Airport to Fuerteventura,' Salmin 
said. 'I was sleeping and woke up to the woman screaming. She was drunk and not listening to the air hostess so 
another passenger nearby asked her to calm down and this escalated to an argument. I was sitting six rows back. 
The noise from her went on for a really long time and one point the person with her turned to the passenger trying 
to calm the situation down and said, 'Let's take it outside.' The passenger said, 'What do you mean? We're in the 
air. How is that possible?'' [embedded content] As the plane prepared for landing, the woman continued her 
aggressive streak, even trying to start a physical fight with a passenger. Spanish civil guards entered the plane 
once it landed at the airport and tried to escort the drunk woman and her partner out of the cabin. A video of the 
incident showed the woman refusing to leave the aircraft. As a result, the guards grabbed her arms and forcibly 
removed her from the plane. "I don't need an ambulance,"the woman was heard yelling at the guards. As the 
woman was being taken out, the rest of the passengers cheered, whistled, and clapped loudly. 'She was such a 
headache,' Salmin said. 'It was a bit funny at first but then I was worried she might get physical. They have a very 
serious word with her partner but I don't know what happened to him after that. We saw the woman sitting outside 
in the airport crying.' A Ryanair spokesperson issued the following statement about the incident: 'The crew of this 
flight from London Stansted to Fuerteventura requested police assistance upon arrival after a passenger became 
disruptive in-flight. The aircraft landed normally and police removed and detained the individual. We will not tolerate 
unruly or disruptive behavior at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our 
number one priority. This is now a matter for local police.' As a result of the woman's behavior, the flight was 
delayed by 20 minutes. In this representational photo, a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 aircraft lands at Barcelona's 'El 
Prat' airport, Sept. 28, 2018. Photo: Pau Barrena/AFP/Getty Images [ 1]: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-

Airline boss Willie Walsh once invoked "magic" when asked how IAG would comply with EU ownership rules.
The EU's transport commissioner - an expert on New Age ideas - seems unimpressed. Violeta Bulc, who studied as 
a shaman, has accused airline groups like IAG of gambling that the UK will not crash out of the EU without a deal.
Her beef is that she has not yet seen their plans for meeting ownership rules. Airlines operating within the EU need 
to show that at least half their shares are held by EU nationals. Such protectionist rules are common across the 
world - though at least the UK has opted not to introduce restrictions of its own after a no-deal Brexit.
The airlines will have six months' grace to reach the EU's ownership threshold. EasyJet is already in touching 
distance, it said yesterday. Ryanair needs a bigger shift. Without the Brits, the share of EU shareholders will fall 
from 55 per cent to 45 per cent. But Ryanair thinks it needs just four months to reach the target. One inducement to 
get Brits to sell would be stripping them of their voting rights.
IAG has greater need of magical thinking. In February, it capped non-EU share ownership at its existing level of 
47.5 per cent. But with a big chunk of shares owned by UK investors, that would rise to as much as 64 per cent 
after Brexit. While IAG has the power to force non-EU shareholders to sell, it thinks it can avoid that. But it has not 
explained how. A statement that it would consider UK shareholders as EU investors after Brexit was dissed as 
"totally absurd" by a Brussels official.
Shareholders, like passengers, should have no illusions about the disruption from a disorderly Brexit. In February, 
IAG's shares fell 7 per cent in two days after the cap on non-EU ownership prompted its removal from MSCI's 
Airlines/Brexit: charm defensive
global equity indices. IAG may well pull a rabbit out of its hat. But it cannot divert attention from the central problem 
for much longer.

 easyJet PLC on Friday said it continues to "stand ready" to activate its no-deal Brexit contingency plan which will 
see the suspension of some shareholders' rights. 
The FTSE 100 budget airline said that in the case of a disorderly exit of the UK from the European Union, it will 
suspend the voting rights of a "small number of shares". This will be done to shares held by non-EU shareholders, 
including UK nationals, on a last-in-first-out basis. 
For the period of suspension, the affected shareholders will not be permitted to attend, speak or vote at meeting of 
the company. 
The plan is needed to ensure easyJet's compliance with EU ownership and control requirements, to allow the airline 
to continue flying across the bloc. 
Currently, easyJet's EU ownership, excluding the UK, stands at 49.9%, below the 50% plus 1 share which will be 
required after Brexit to comply with EU rules. 
Earlier in March, airline peer Ryanair Holdings PLC implemented a similar plan among its resolutions to protect the 
company in the case of a no-deal Brexit. 
Ryanair decided that all shares held by non-EU shareholders, including UK ones after Brexit, will be treated as 
"restricted shares", meaning that they will have no entitlement to attend, speak or vote at any company meeting. 
Furthermore, Ryanair added that the prohibition on non-EU nationals to acquire shares, announced in 2002, 
continues to apply.

Most of the focus in the aftermath of the Ethiopian air crash this month has been on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 
illfated 737 Max aircraft.
But a different company - Norwegian Air Shuttle, the low-cost airline - has been harder hit by stock markets since 
the crash.
Its shares fell close to 10 per cent on Wednesday on the back of a brutal analyst downgrade from HSBC, bringing 
its total losses since the Ethiopian crash to more than 16 per cent. Boeing is down 10 per cent in the same period.
Norwegian itself had 18 of the 737 Max aircraft, out of a fleet of about 160, and is demanding compensation from 
Boeing for their grounding. But for analysts and investors, the fallout from the crash has raised renewed questions 
about Norwegian's stretched finances and its ability to survive.
Preben Rasch-Olsen, analyst at Carnegie, the Swedish bank, said: "Norwegian is probably one of the most 
financially geared airlines in the world. Things like this hurt a lot."
The carrier has had a difficult year amid intense doubts about its vulnerability after a long period of growth. It faced 
problems last year with the Dreamliner, another Boeing aircraft, and one of its 737s was stranded in Iran for more

as carrier faces profitability problems
than a month this year because of problems with US sanctions. A potential bid from the owner of British Airways 
never materialised, and the shares are down 70 per cent from their highs last year.
The grounding of the 737 Max could have been even worse for Norwegian: it closed a months-long NKr3bn 
($353m) rights issue to shore up its balance sheet only last Friday.
But analysts say that Norwegian is suffering from more than just bad luck.
"I would argue that the company has no reserves for anything to go wrong - and that's not a good position for 
airlines, as something always goes wrong. Their business model is broken and they're not doing enough to fix it," 
said Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein.
The outlook from many is bleak. Norwegian's shares traded as high as NKr171 last May but closed on Wednesday 
at NKr50.7 as Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, cut his price target to just NKr20. He forecast a deeper than 
expected loss of NKr3bn this year and another deficit of NKr1.1bn in 2020, reversing a forecast of a small profit.
"The losses they are going to incur from the Max problems will see them eat through that equity injection very 
quickly. The profitability of the business is going to be very weak," he added.
The airline, the largest low-cost carrier in Europe after Ryanair and easyJet, made a strategy change this year, 
promising an end to rapid growth in which it started myriad transatlantic services. Instead, Norwegian promised a 
focus on profitability through cutting costs and selling off aircraft.
Mr Lobbenberg said that the groundings paradoxically could be a "strategic opportunity" as it could raise the price of 
the older planes Norwegian is trying to sell, as well as cutting its capital expenditure as its pending orders for 92 
further 737 Maxes are delayed.
There are doubts over how successful Norwegian's strategy will be. Mr Lobbenberg said economies of scale were 
likely to reverse, leading to higher costs, even if weaker routes were cut.
Mr Rasch-Olsen said: "It's not a quick fix that Norwegian is trying to do. Lowering costs to hopefully resume 
profitability. They have a lot to prove before you can be more certain that what they're doing is paying off."
As part of its efforts to save NKr2bn, Norwegian said it would close its base at Palma in Mallorca, affecting about 
100 pilots and cabin crew. But instead of laying off the staff, which would have proved expensive, Norwegian now 
wants to suspend their contracts and in effect put them on unpaid leave for up to a year, according to a letter sent 
by the company to workers in Palma.
Norwegian made specific reference to the 737 Max groundings, saying "it had narrowed our options even further" 
while it also stressed the "seriousness of the situation" regarding its finances.
One Norwegian pilot said it was like "a siege" with the airline trying to "starve them out". The pilot added the 
company was "going for the easy option without consideration of the human cost and inevitable impact of creating 
an atmosphere of low morale".
Norwegian said the suspension was a "perfectly standard measure" designed to protect "the many and not the few"

Most of the focus in the aftermath of the Ethiopian air crash this month has been on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 
illfated 737 Max aircraft.
But a different company - Norwegian Air Shuttle, the low-cost airline - has been harder hit by stock markets since 
the crash.
Its shares fell close to 10 per cent on Wednesday on the back of a brutal analyst downgrade from HSBC, bringing 
its total losses since the Ethiopian crash to more than 16 per cent. Boeing is down 10 per cent in the same period.
Norwegian itself had 18 of the 737 Max aircraft, out of a fleet of about 160, and is demanding compensation from 
Boeing for their grounding. But for analysts and investors, the fallout from the crash has raised renewed questions 
about Norwegian's stretched finances and its ability to survive.
Preben Rasch-Olsen, analyst at Carnegie, the Swedish bank, said: "Norwegian is probably one of the most 
financially geared airlines in the world. Things like this hurt a lot."
The carrier has had a difficult year amid intense doubts about its vulnerability after a long period of growth. It faced 
problems last year with the Dreamliner, another Boeing aircraft, and one of its 737s was stranded in Iran for more

than a month this year because of problems with US sanctions. A potential bid from the owner of British Airways 
never materialised, and the shares are down 70 per cent from their highs last year.
The grounding of the 737 Max could have been even worse for Norwegian: it closed a months-long NKr3bn 
($353m) rights issue to shore up its balance sheet only last Friday.
But analysts say that Norwegian is suffering from more than just bad luck.
"I would argue that the company has no reserves for anything to go wrong - and that's not a good position for 
airlines, as something always goes wrong. Their business model is broken and they're not doing enough to fix it," 
said Daniel Roeska, analyst at Bernstein.
The outlook from many is bleak. Norwegian's shares traded as high as NKr171 last May but closed on Wednesday 
at NKr50.7 as Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC, cut his price target to just NKr20. He forecast a deeper than 
expected loss of NKr3bn this year and another deficit of NKr1.1bn in 2020, reversing a forecast of a small profit.
"The losses they are going to incur from the Max problems will see them eat through that equity injection very 
quickly. The profitability of the business is going to be very weak," he added.
The airline, the largest low-cost carrier in Europe after Ryanair and easyJet, made a strategy change this year, 
promising an end to rapid growth in which it started myriad transatlantic services. Instead, Norwegian promised a 
focus on profitability through cutting costs and selling off aircraft.
Mr Lobbenberg said that the groundings paradoxically could be a "strategic opportunity" as it could raise the price of 
the older planes Norwegian is trying to sell, as well as cutting its capital expenditure as its pending orders for 92 
further 737 Maxes are delayed.
There are doubts over how successful Norwegian's strategy will be. Mr Lobbenberg said economies of scale were 
likely to reverse, leading to higher costs, even if weaker routes were cut.
Mr Rasch-Olsen said: "It's not a quick fix that Norwegian is trying to do. Lowering costs to hopefully resume 
profitability. They have a lot to prove before you can be more certain that what they're doing is paying off."
As part of its efforts to save NKr2bn, Norwegian said it would close its base at Palma in Mallorca, affecting about 
100 pilots and cabin crew. But instead of laying off the staff, which would have proved expensive, Norwegian now 
wants to suspend their contracts and in effect put them on unpaid leave for up to a year, according to a letter sent 
by the company to workers in Palma.
Norwegian made specific reference to the 737 Max groundings, saying "it had narrowed our options even further" 
while it also stressed the "seriousness of the situation" regarding its finances.
One Norwegian pilot said it was like "a siege" with the airline trying to "starve them out". The pilot added the 
company was "going for the easy option without consideration of the human cost and inevitable impact of creating 
an atmosphere of low morale".
Norwegian said the suspension was a "perfectly standard measure" designed to protect "the many and not the few" 
among its 2,400 workers in Spain.
It added that analysts such as Mr Lobbenberg did not "have the entire picture" as the company was "well positioned 
to continue to attract new customers, not least in the long-haul market" after the rights issue.

No-deal Brexit share trade ruling sparks accusations of EU 'land grab' Equities
No-deal Brexit share trade ruling sparks accusations of EU 'land grab';

European fund managers have called on regulators to reconsider plans that would prevent them from trading some 
of the UK's biggest stocks in London in the event of a no-deal Brexit, amid accusations that the EU is mounting a 
"land grab" of UK share trading.
Investors were surprised by a ruling late on Tuesday from the European Securities and Markets Authority, the pan-
European administrator, which detailed some 6,200 stocks that EU-registered investors would have to trade in the 
EU if the UK leaves the bloc without a deal.
The list included 14 stocks whose home listing is in London and which trade overwhelmingly on the city's main 
exchange, such as Vodafone, Rio Tinto and BP. All 6,200 stocks are either EUbased or have a second, highly 
active listing in London, such as Ryanair.
Esma's ruling drew a sharp response from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which warned it could lead to 
"disruption".
Executives also said the ruling could clash with requirements for brokers and asset managers to secure the best 
prices for their transactions. London-listed shares often see much higher volumes of trading than equivalents in 
Europe, meaning that big trades can be carried out more efficiently.
No-deal Brexit share trade ruling sparks accusations of EU 'land grab' Equities
"I think it's politically led - this is a land grab at a time of real uncertainty," said Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of 
Aquis Exchange, a UK trading venue that last year set up another venue in Paris in preparation for Britain's exit 
from the EU. "It's good news for Aquis but it's very bad news for investors. Splitting up liquidity is poor for the 
endinvestor."
EU-based fund managers had hoped that regulators would recognise UK exchanges as having "equivalent" 
standards, thus easing fears that an abrupt departure from the bloc next week could create market instability.
Vincent Dessard, senior regulatory adviser at the European Fund and Asset Management Association, a trade body 
based in Brussels, said Esma's rulings were "insufficient".
"We believe this will lead to a fire-sale of securities, which will impact upon the revenues and savings of EU 
citizens. We urge the European Commission to ... grant equivalence to all UK recognised trading venues and for all 
types of financial instruments."
Brokers and asset managers face further complications if the UK applies the same share trading obligation in a 
nodeal Brexit, as it has said it plans to do. In that scenario, a UK broker would not be able to trade Deutsche Bank 
in Germany, for example.
One executive predicted that banks would have to move trading desks into Europe and investors may turn to 
derivatives such as equity swaps, which are outside the scope of the rules.
Others may simply stop trading. "We don't see how it's possible to comply with this other than ceasing to trade the 
[names] affected," said Jiri Krol, deputy chief executive of the London-based Alternative Investment Management 
Association.
Some observers were bemused at how Esma had arrived at its list of stocks that would be affected.
Many companies on the list were unaware they had been included. Nick Burchett, head of UK equities at Cavendish 
Asset Management, said markets simply wanted a smooth and transparent way of trading stocks across Europe.

European fund managers have called on regulators to reconsider plans that would prevent them from trading some 
of the UK's biggest stocks in London in the event of a no-deal Brexit, amid accusations that the EU is mounting a 
"land grab" of UK share trading.
Investors were surprised by a ruling late on Tuesday from the European Securities and Markets Authority, the pan-
European administrator, which detailed some 6,200 stocks that EU-registered investors would have to trade in the 
EU if the UK leaves the bloc without a deal.
The list included 14 stocks whose home listing is in London and which trade overwhelmingly on the city's main 
exchange, such as Vodafone, Rio Tinto and BP. All 6,200 stocks are either EUbased or have a second, highly 
active listing in London, such as Ryanair.
Esma's ruling drew a sharp response from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, which warned it could lead to 
"disruption".
Executives also said the ruling could clash with requirements for brokers and asset managers to secure the best 
prices for their transactions. London-listed shares often see much higher volumes of trading than equivalents in 
Europe, meaning that big trades can be carried out more efficiently.
No-deal Brexit share trade ruling sparks accusations of EU 'land grab'; Equities
"I think it's politically led - this is a land grab at a time of real uncertainty," said Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of 
Aquis Exchange, a UK trading venue that last year set up another venue in Paris in preparation for Britain's exit 
from the EU. "It's good news for Aquis but it's very bad news for investors. Splitting up liquidity is poor for the 
endinvestor."
EU-based fund managers had hoped that regulators would recognise UK exchanges as having "equivalent" 
standards, thus easing fears that an abrupt departure from the bloc next week could create market instability.
Vincent Dessard, senior regulatory adviser at the European Fund and Asset Management Association, a trade body 
based in Brussels, said Esma's rulings were "insufficient".
"We believe this will lead to a fire-sale of securities, which will impact upon the revenues and savings of EU 
citizens. We urge the European Commission to ... grant equivalence to all UK recognised trading venues and for all 
types of financial instruments."
Brokers and asset managers face further complications if the UK applies the same share trading obligation in a 
nodeal Brexit, as it has said it plans to do. In that scenario, a UK broker would not be able to trade Deutsche Bank 
in Germany, for example.
One executive predicted that banks would have to move trading desks into Europe and investors may turn to 
derivatives such as equity swaps, which are outside the scope of the rules.
Others may simply stop trading. "We don't see how it's possible to comply with this other than ceasing to trade the 
[names] affected," said Jiri Krol, deputy chief executive of the London-based Alternative Investment Management 
Association.
Some observers were bemused at how Esma had arrived at its list of stocks that would be affected.

Will Ryanair gain from turbulent O'Leary moving aside?

EARLIER this month, the chief of budget airline Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, announced he would be stepping back 
from the dayto-day running of the airline. O'Leary identified his reputation as a negative distraction to the airline's 
business and that the move would be a chance to "reboot" the company's public perception after "disappointing" 
profit announcements.
O'Leary was cited as a main cause of the employee dissatisfaction that led to the infamous pilot strikes last year. 
This, alongside O'Leary's headline-making quotes such as, "We don't want to hear your sob stories. What part of 
'no refund' don't you understand?" have made him a divisive character in the industry.
But will moving away from O'Leary be beneficial to 'the UK's least-liked short-haul airline'? YouGov data suggests 
that when it comes to brand perception customers do respond to the actions of management; whether that is 
positively or negatively.
During 2018, 250 flights were cancelled due to strikes over pay and employment issues. Ryanair then refused to 
pay compensation to customers. During this time Ryanair's Buzz Score (a net measure of whether consumers have 
heard anything positive or negative about the brand in the last fortnight) sank almost 10 points from -28.3 to -37.9. 
This fall was also reflected in Impression scores (whether someone has a positive or negative impression of a 
brand) which fell 5 points (-42.2 to -48.4) and Consideration scores (whether someone would consider purchasing 
from the brand in future) which fell 4 points (+21.6 to +17.5) showing customers reacted to management decisions.
Since O'Leary's announcement on 8 March, all of Ryanair's metrics have risen; Buzz scores lifted 8 points (-25.8 to 
-17.3) suggesting a positive public perception. Ryanair's Impression scores also lifted 17 points (-46.3 to -29), and 
Consideration 11 points (+15.5 to +26.6).
Will Ryanair gain from turbulent O'Leary moving aside?
It may seem surprising that brand equity scores respond to news about a company's management, but we have 
often observed that in our numbers.
The effect may be small but it is marked in cases such as Ryanair where the management have deliberately made 
themselves part of the story. The new leadership should make its lead brand assets - low prices and a good safety 
record - the big story, and stay anonymous themselves.

Job swaps
Two Irishmen, a Dutchman, a German and a Swede walk on to a stage. The scene is the headline chief executives 
panel session at the recent Airlines For Europe (A4E) summit in Brussels, and the bosses of EasyJet, British 
Airways parent International Airlines Group, KLM, Lufthansa, and Ryanair are asked by moderator Richard Quest 
which of their competitors they would like to run for a week, and why.
Lufty’s Carsen Spohr is first to respond, and plays it relatively safe: “I would take Willie [Walsh]’s job because I am 
jealous of his home market in London,” he replies in reference to IAG’s British Airways, playing it relatively safe.”
Walsh, however, decides to go in harder, picking on a subject that is the subject of frequent industry rumours: “I 
would take KLM and spend that week convincing them that they should be part of IAG,” he says.
KLM’s Pieter Elbers refuses to take up the bait, and instead has a dig at his low-cost rivals: “I would take Ryanair 
and I would show customers that they could really have an enjoyable journey if they pay a few pounds more.”
This prompts Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary to rethink his answer: “I’ve changed my mind in the last few seconds. I 
was originally going to say Carsten so I could [experience] what it feels like to own Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland,” he says. “But I’ve changed [to KLM], so that I can encourage the Dutch government to buy more of Air 
France,” a reference to his earlier comments that state ownership of any airline is bad business, and benefits the 
Irish low-cost carrier.
And what of EasyJet’s chief executive, Johan Lundgren? “I’d take all of them,” he says, to more laughs from the 
audience, before adding: “I noticed that nobody wanted to take us. I take that as a massive compliment.”
Avro-lling back the years
British Airways may be taking inspiration from its past with its recent one-off BOAC and BEA liveries. Is it also going 
back in time when it comes to its fleet? Its London City-based CityFlyer operation, created in the mid-noughties 
Headline to come headline to come headline to
when it sold BA Connect (“Bacon”) to Flybe, is leasing a BAE Systems Avro RJ85 and BAe 146 for summer – types 
it has not flown since replacing them with Embraer E-Jets a decade ago.
Paint what you do
Meanwhile, the flag-carrier’s retro colour schemes sent us scurrying to our archives, and to a time when this column 
really wielded influence.
In 1958, with Britain emerging from the gloomy post-war era, Uncle Roger bemoaned BEA’s lack of imagination 
when it came to painting its newest aircraft. “I have often wondered how many more seats BEA would have sold 
had the Corporation styles its Viscounts, inside and out, more imaginatively,” he wrote. “I suppose BEA consider 
American-style paint-schemes to be flashy and vulgar [but]I am afraid that BEA’s future new aircraft look like being 
as plain as ever. The Comet 3B at Farnborough appeared almost wan, as if someone had said at the last moment: 
‘I suppose we ought to put some markings on it.’”
In 1959, Flight reported that BEA’s Comet 4Bs and Vanguards “are to be painted in the boldest colour scheme yet 
adopted by a British airline”, noting rather triumphantly that it had made a “plea for brighter colour schemes” a year 
earlier.
Union flak
What are we to make of EASA’s recent subtle name change to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency? With 
the UK’s status within the regulator uncertain after Brexit, are the Cologne-ialists making a point ahead of the 
country’s departure date?
Eating Italian
Air France-KLM boss Ben Smith says his airline group is observing the sale of Alitalia “very closely”. In fact, the 
Franco-Dutch combine, Delta, and EasyJet are tracking the flag-carrier’s faltering progress in much the same way 
that a vulture, lion and hyena follow an elderly, sick antelope wondering whether all that effort will be worth it for 
lunch, and whether it might actually leave them with a terrible tummy-ache.

 easyJet PLC on Monday said it withdrew from the process of forming a consortium for the potential acquisition of 
Italian flag carrier Alitalia Societa Aerea Italiana Spa. 
The budget airline said it took this decision following discussions with Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane and US's 
Delta Air Lines, the other two potential members of the consortium.
Ferrovie dello Stato is a state-owned company that manages the Italian rail network, while Delta is an Atlanta, 
Georgia-based airline. 
"easyJet remains committed to Italy, as a key market for the company, where it currently carries 18.5 million 
passengers every year and employs 1400 pilots and crew, all on local contracts," the budget airline said. 
Back in February, easyJet confirmed talks for the potential acquisition of the beleaguered Italian airline.
At the end of October, easyJet submitted a proposal expressing interest in Alitalia after the Italian government was 
forced to rescue the company in 2017.
Alitalia went into government-controlled administration in 2017 and was kept afloat by Italian state loans worth 
EUR900 million. The Italian government was supposed to recoup the money by December 15, 2018 and wrap up 
bankruptcy procedures; however it decided to extend the loan to June 30, 2019.
Back in June 2018, both easyJet and fellow budget operator Ryanair Holdings PLC expresses interest in acquiring 
Alitalia, with the latter backing out following chaos caused by strikes and flights cancellations.
easyJet already flies to many destinations in Italy, including Rome, Milan and Naples.
easyjet shares were trading down 0.8% at 1,249.00 pence each.

Mar 18, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Two men were 
detained on a Ryanair flight from Glasgow, Scotland, to Tenerife, Spain, after they broke into a fight and left blood 
across the cabin Saturday. Another passenger was left with a bloody nose as a result of the brawl. Footage of the 
fight was shared on Twitter and it shows two men hitting each other as a flight attendant tries to separate them 
while several other passengers scream.In the video, shot by Ben Wardrop, two men can be seen tackling each 
other halfway down the aisle. 
One of them is wearing a cap and a hoodie, while the other one is a younger man in a black top. Another passenger 
can be heard saying, 'Boys stop this. Why are you just sat watching?' The men can be seen fighting for a few more 
moments, before they are pulled off of each other. As the man in the cap is taken towards the front of the plane, 
another man can be seen being escorted by the cabin crew with blood dripping down his face. Several passengers 
said he was trying to break up the fight when he got struck by one of the men. According to Wardrop[1], the fight 
began after a drunk man commented on a woman going to the toilet barefoot. The woman's boyfriend stepped in to 
diffuse the situation, eventually leading to a fight between him and the drunk man. 'Once the plane landed and more 
alcohol was consumed the man and the woman's boyfriend started arguing, both being very drunk they started to 
fight, and the man in the video with lots of blood was trying to get the man to calm down and he got hit on the nose. 
One of the cabin crew, which was a young woman aged about 24, was caught in the middle of it all and was very 
scare, but done a good job on defusing the men fighting,' he said. He further said the staff on the aircraft 'handled 
the situation very well[2].' In a photo shared on Twitter by another user, blood can be seen on the door of an 
overhead luggage compartment. Police from Tenerife were called to the airport after the incident and both men 
were detained.'The crew of this flight from Glasgow Prestwich to Tenerife requested police assistance upon arrival 
after two passengers became disruptive in-flight. The aircraft landed normally and police removed and detained two 
individuals. We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behavior at any time and the safety and comfort of our 
customers, crew and aircraft is out number one priority. This is now a matter for local police,' a Ryanair 
spokesperson said in a statement to local media.[3] Two passengers on a Ryanair flight from Glasgow, Scotland, to 
Tenerife, Spain, were detained after they got into a fight, leaving one person with a bloody nose. This image shows

Amy, the PR whizz I'm thrilled to be working with you! It's a great opportunity for our agency.
Twitter Q&As are a terrific way to get brand engagement, a younger audience and raise your personal profile.
Profits? It's tricky to determine the return on investment on Twitter engagement. I see it as magic rather than 
money. As well as metrics, inflection points, RTs! Change your mindset - that's why you hired Spasm PR, to bring 
your brand up to date. Don't think cash flow. Think, profile. Think, reputation. Think viral!
Good point, you didn't get to be Europe's number one herpes drugmaker without thinking about such things - 
#herpes! No, we won't get that hashtag trending. Promise! Trust me.
It won't be like #AskJPM. They are reviled bankers on huge bonuses, you are completely different - a pharma 
company! You help people! Let's get #Drugeze trending!
No, nothing like Ryanair either! Unless you start making sexist comments. You won't, will you? Phew!
So, we have put out the promotional tweet: "What does it take to lead a pharma company? Tweet your questions to 
Stewart, Drug-eze's CEO, 1/4/19 @drugeze #AskDrugeze" Yes, an entire week of focus groups and workshopping.
Ready? Let's go!
'Don't think cashflow. Think profile. Think viral!'; Work Tribes
Wow, generating a lot of traffic. "Is it true that at night you hook yourself up to an intravenous drip that pumps the 
tears of children through your veins.
#AskDrugeze" "What sparked your interest in herpes? #AskDrugeze" Here's a good one. "How do I become a 
pharma bro like you and Martin Shkreli?" No? OK.
"Did you sleep like a feverish baby when you raised your antimalarial drug price by 3000%?" You've gone viral! Can 
I also recommend Spasm PR's crisis management services? Sol, the management guru Hello and thank you for 
downloading the latest episode of The Digest with Sol Santos. I'm Sol. Hi. And remember: "No gut, no glory"!
You may be one of the 1,203 satisfied clients who have restructured their org chart along Colonarchic™ principles, 
from stomach to large intestine. Or you may be a reader of my bestseller Burp! or my latest Straight through the 
Gut: Digestive Secrets of the World's Greatest Leaders.
If so, welcome - and if not, double welcome - to the latest phase in my "Regular Movements" movement. Drumroll! 
I'm going to take these ideas, pivot, reverse back up the digestive tract, and create an entire community around 
mindful mastication!
Did you know, studies show workers who chew their food 32 times are 47 per cent more productive than their 
colleagues? That works out at $47bn of innovation potential simply gobbled down half-eaten and ultimately flushed 
away every year in North America alone.
But - newsflash! - the chomping times they are achanging. State of the art trituration tech can empower millennials 
to change the culture of food intake for the benefit of individuals, companies and society as a whole.
But if we're going to build this compassionate world, one munch at a time, I need your help. Subscribe direct at the 
end of this podcast for bitesized updates, book a 32-Chew-And-You™ session for your team with me or one of my 
growing network of certified wellbeing coaches, or just buy branded apparel, including our new purposeled dribble-
bib, to support the cause online at www.MasticationNation.com.
More about those opportunities later. First, I'm happy to welcome Professor Joelle Sawbubble from Al Dunlap 
Business School, who's going to talk about her latest work, linking swifter swallowing to kinder corporate 
governance.
Joelle, hi!

Amy, the PR whizz I'm thrilled to be working with you! It's a great opportunity for our agency.
Twitter Q&As are a terrific way to get brand engagement, a younger audience and raise your personal profile.
Profits? It's tricky to determine the return on investment on Twitter engagement. I see it as magic rather than 
money. As well as metrics, inflection points, RTs! Change your mindset - that's why you hired Spasm PR, to bring 
your brand up to date. Don't think cash flow. Think, profile. Think, reputation. Think viral!
Good point, you didn't get to be Europe's number one herpes drugmaker without thinking about such things - 
#herpes! No, we won't get that hashtag trending. Promise! Trust me.
It won't be like #AskJPM. They are reviled bankers on huge bonuses, you are completely different - a pharma 
company! You help people! Let's get #Drugeze trending!
No, nothing like Ryanair either! Unless you start making sexist comments. You won't, will you? Phew!
So, we have put out the promotional tweet: "What does it take to lead a pharma company? Tweet your questions to 
Stewart, Drug-eze's CEO, 1/4/19 @drugeze #AskDrugeze" Yes, an entire week of focus groups and workshopping.
Ready? Let's go!
'Don't think cashflow. Think profile. Think viral!' Work Tribes
Wow, generating a lot of traffic. "Is it true that at night you hook yourself up to an intravenous drip that pumps the 
tears of children through your veins.
#AskDrugeze" "What sparked your interest in herpes? #AskDrugeze" Here's a good one. "How do I become a 
pharma bro like you and Martin Shkreli?" No? OK.
"Did you sleep like a feverish baby when you raised your antimalarial drug price by 3000%?" You've gone viral! Can 
I also recommend Spasm PR's crisis management services? Sol, the management guru Hello and thank you for 
downloading the latest episode of The Digest with Sol Santos. I'm Sol. Hi. And remember: "No gut, no glory"!
You may be one of the 1,203 satisfied clients who have restructured their org chart along Colonarchic™ principles, 
from stomach to large intestine. Or you may be a reader of my bestseller Burp! or my latest Straight through the 
Gut: Digestive Secrets of the World's Greatest Leaders.
If so, welcome - and if not, double welcome - to the latest phase in my "Regular Movements" movement. Drumroll! 
I'm going to take these ideas, pivot, reverse back up the digestive tract, and create an entire community around 
mindful mastication!
Did you know, studies show workers who chew their food 32 times are 47 per cent more productive than their 
colleagues? That works out at $47bn of innovation potential simply gobbled down half-eaten and ultimately flushed 
away every year in North America alone.
But - newsflash! - the chomping times they are achanging. State of the art trituration tech can empower millennials 
to change the culture of food intake for the benefit of individuals, companies and society as a whole.
But if we're going to build this compassionate world, one munch at a time, I need your help. Subscribe direct at the 
end of this podcast for bitesized updates, book a 32-Chew-And-You™ session for your team with me or one of my 
growing network of certified wellbeing coaches, or just buy branded apparel, including our new purposeled dribble-
bib, to support the cause online at www.MasticationNation.com.
More about those opportunities later. First, I'm happy to welcome Professor Joelle Sawbubble from Al Dunlap 
Business School, who's going to talk about her latest work, linking swifter swallowing to kinder corporate 
governance.
Joelle, hi!

ROD PUTS A PENNY OR OR TWO ON THE GEE-GEES Rod Stewart was getting into the spirit of things at the 
Festival yesterday, strolling into the course clad in tan tweed and cords.
He and wife Penny Lancaster are Cheltenham regulars and will celebrate their 12th wedding anniversary later this 
year.
Also on the radar for Rod is his upcoming tour, which includes another racecourse visit with a concert at York 
Racecourse in June.
The 74-year-old rocker, not shy of a flutter, may want to keep a few quid back for his closing shows in Las Vegas in 
September.
ANDY THEY'RE TOFF!TV personality Georgia Toffolo is a huge racing fan but insists she has no plans get on a 
horse, despite being asked repeatedly.
'Toff', 24, grew up in Devon, used to ride as a youngster and counts some top jockeys as friends.
But, while taking a tour of The Orchard, Festival presenting partners Magners' new activation at the racecourse, she 
revealed why she isn't tempted yet by any offers to get in the saddle.
She said: "I used to ride when I was little and I keep getting asked if I'll take part in a charity race. I just don't think 
I'd be very good so I'm going to stick to watching from the sidelines I think!" WORTH BACKING AN OUT-CIDER IN 
GOLD CUP Gold Cup sponsors Magners will encourage racing fans to look at the silver lining by offering the 
opportunity to swap a 'losing ticket' for a case of its Original Irish Cider.
CHELTENHAM DIARY
Racegoers need only prove they took a punt on the last placed horse by uploading a picture of their slip to a 
dedicated page on the Magn-ers website.
Dou-ble Shuffle and Yala Enki are currently the biggest-priced horses for today's feature race.
THURSDAY IS THE NEW LADIES' DAY Wednesday is the official Ladies' Day at the Cheltenham Festival, but a 
hattrick of female winners yesterday really put the girls in the limelight. Bryony Frost (pictured) drove Frodon to 
victory in the Ryanair to become the first female jockey to ride a Grade One winner over fences at the Festival, 
before Stayers' Hurdle-winning trainer Emma Lavelle and jockey Lizzie Kelly both ended up in the winners' 
enclosure.
Maybe Shattered Love, the only mare contesting today's Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup, will continue the trend.

Ryanair is to resurrect the ‘Buzz’ airline brand later this year, using it for its newly-established Polish operation 
Ryanair Sun.
The airline says it will rebrand Ryanair Sun, which was set up last year, with the new identity being introduced from 
autumn.
Ryanair
Ryanair Sun flies under a Polish air operator’s certificate and uses a fleet of 17 Boeing 737-800s.
The Buzz brand was acquired by Ryanair when it took over KLM UK budget airline operating under this name in 
April 2003.
It was originally incorporated into a new Ryanair subsidiary, Buzz Stansted, which operated services using a fleet of 
737s and British Aerospace 146s.
Ryanair has since established a new UK operation, Ryanair UK, with its own air operator’s certificate, as part of its 
efforts to prepare for the country’s departure from the European Union.
The Buzz brand name is to be revived with the Polish operation and Buzz will become one of the four carriers within 
Ryanair Holdings – alongside Ryanair itself, Laudamotion, and Ryanair UK.
Ryanair Sun chief executive Michal Kaczmarzyk says the fleet will have a “new and unique branding” when Buzz is 
launched.
“Our goal is to offer services at the highest level to both customers and tour operators,” he adds.
Ryanair resurrects Buzz brand for Polish airline operation Ryanair is to resurrect the 'Buzz' airline brand later 
this year, using it for its newly-established ....
Buzz will operate scheduled and charter flights and Ryanair aims to expand its fleet to 25 aircraft by summer this 
year.

Highlight: CorporaciÃ³n AmÃ©rica Airports has reported preliminary year-over-year passenger traffic growth of 
5.5% in February 2019.
Body
Passenger Traffic OverviewTotal passenger traffic in February 2019 increased 5.5% YoY, primarily reflecting 
growth of 7.9% in Argentina, 2.8% in Brazil and 8.2% in Ecuador.In Argentina, total passenger traffic increased 
7.9% YoY, mainly driven by 17.2% growth in domestic passengers, benefiting from the launch of several new 
routes and addition to new airlines during 2018, together with a mix-shift to domestic from international travel by 
local passengers. This was partially offset by a decline of 5.4% in international passengers, reflecting continued 
challenging macro conditions. After a full year of operations, El Palomar Airport, our facility servicing low-cost flights 
located in Greater Buenos Aires, ranked 7th in terms of passenger traffic across our network. 
Also driven by low-cost Airlines Norwegian and Flybondi, our Mendoza, C&oacute;rdoba and Iguaz&uacute; 
airports posted increases in domestic traffic of 39.7%, 23.9% and 27.2%, respectively in February.In Italy, 
passenger traffic rose 5.2%, driven by an increase of 5.2% in Pisa Airport mainly related to the addition of 
frequencies by Ryanair and flights by Pobeda to Moscow. In Florence Airport, passenger traffic increased 5.3%, 
due to easier comps as last year traffic was impacted by Air France pilots’ strike, together with the good 
performance of TAP’s connection to Lisbon and the additional flights to Madrid by Iberia.In Brazil, passenger traffic 
at Brasilia airport increased 3.5%, mainly due to an increase of 2.1% in domestic traffic, offset by a decline in 
international traffic mainly as a result of the change in methodology in traffic count by ANAC. Based on the prior 
methodology, international traffic would have increased 32.5% YoY at this airport. Domestic traffic growth remained 
impacted by a reduction in less profitable routes and frequencies by LATAM Airlines, and a decline of approximately 
20% in seat supply at Avianca Brasil. By contrast, Gol continues with its plan to expand operations at Brasilia 
Airport, with new domestic flights to be launched during the first half of the year. International traffic at Brasilia 
Airport declined 10.2% impacted by the new methodology in traffic count applied since June 2018 as discussed 
above. This more than offset traffic growth resulting from the continued good performance of routes to Miami and 
CorporaciÃ³n AmÃ©rica Airports announces preliminary year-over-year passenger traffic growth of 5.5% in 
February 2019
Orlando opened by Gol Airlines in November and the addition of a new direct flight to Buenos Aires during 
December.In Ecuador, passenger traffic increased 8.2%, with international passenger traffic at Guayaquil Airport up 
11.8%, mainly attributed to the continued good performance of the Spirit Airlines flight to Fort Lauderdale introduced 
in March 2018 and the increase in frequencies by COPA Airlines.Cargo Volume and Aircraft MovementsCargo 
volume increased 11.8% in February 2019 mainly as a result a 98.5% increase in Brazil, mainly related to an 
increase in exports, offset by a decline of 7.9% in Argentina, related to the continued challenging macroeconomic 
conditions.Aircraft movements increased 2.5% in February 2019, mainly as a result of increases of 4.5% in 
Argentina and 24.0% in Ecuador, partially offset by a 6.4% decline in Brazil.

TIGER Roll, last year's Grand National winner, made the title of the most versatile horse in training very much his 
own when producing a sumptuous display to win a second Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase.
The hugely popular jumper even brought a tear to the eye of his usually no-nonsense owner, the Ryanair boss 
Michael O'Leary, as he ran out the easiest winner of the Cheltenham Festival so far in a 22-length romp.
It was such a dominant performance that Tiger Roll was cut to 6-1 with Coral and Betway for next month's Grand 
National for which he is now likely to go off one of the hottest ever favourites when he bids to become the first horse 
since Red Rum in 1973 and 1974 to claim victory in successive runnings of the race.
Tiger Roll had already entered Cheltenham folklore having won at three Festivals, capturing the 2014 Triumph 
Hurdle, the four mile National Hunt Chase in 2017 and last year's Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase.
Having warmed up for Cheltenham with a surprise victory in a Grade Two Hurdle at Navan, he came into the race, 
a challenge featuring 32 obstacles including a series of banks, ditches and 'the cheese wedges', rated one of the 
'bankers' of the week.
Yet his trainer Gordon Elliott, who enjoyed eight winners at last year's Festival to finish top trainer, had begun this 
year's meeting with 17 successive losers, among them four favourites including Apple's Jade in the Champion 
Hurdle.

yesterday's Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase
Under Keith Donoghue, Tiger Roll was never in danger of joining the list of stable failures. He sat in fourth place for 
much of the way behind the long time leader Kingswell Theatre, taking closer order with eight to jump.
He jumped to the front at the third last and from there it was plain sailing. Donoghue never had to get too serious 
with the nine-year-old who strode right away from the field to leave Josie's Orders, winner of the race in 2016, to 
win the battle for second place with French challenger Urgent De Gregaine by three quarters of a length.
Donoghue was coaxed out of retirement to partner Tiger Roll last year but lost the ride in the Grand National to 
Davy Russell because he couldn't do the weight.
He said: "Tiger Roll is a legend in my eyes. He was my first Cheltenham Festival winner last year and is the horse 
that got my name out there.
"He is some horse and that was some performance on heavy ground. He tanked the whole way and the further we 
went the better he was getting. It was easy. He has the heart of a lion.
"What Tiger Roll has done is serious, winning at four different Festivals in three different races, plus a Grand 
National and Munster National. Today was arguably his best performance. What a trainer Gordon is to bring him 
back here every year because he's had his problems.
"If it wasn't for Gordon, I wouldn't be in this situation and if it wasn't for Gordon, Tiger Roll wouldn't be such a good 
horse either. He is a master of a trainer.
"This is a dream come true. Last year was unreal but this year I can appreciate it more. I think he can win back-to-
back Nationals, but we'll leave that to Davy Russell. I hope he does it for him."
Elliott said: "It's unbelievable.
Tiger Roll is something else. He got us out of trouble because we were having a rough week.
"Tiger Roll is a legend. The way he did that, the way he did it in the Boyne Hurdle, he is class."

Low-cost airline easyJet is stockpiling spare parts for its aircraft in continental Europe in case a no-deal Brexit 
severs its supply chains.
Johan Lundgren, chief executive, said easyJet had also been transferring three aircraft a week to its new Austrian 
subsidiary, which now had a fleet of 130. He said the airline was "stockpiling" spare parts for the Austrian fleet, "so 
as part of our Brexit preparations we're making sure we're not reliant on spare parts ... only in the UK".
He said easyJet had "pre-purchased a number of spare parts" and allocated them to the right facilities.
The transfers represent a significant portion of easyJet's fleet, which numbered 315 aircraft last year. Of the airline's 
4,000 pilots, 1,400 now have Austrian registration, along with 3,000 cabin crew. Mr Lundgren said Brexit 
preparations had cost easyJet £10m as well as lost time.
Fellow low-cost carrier Ryanair already has "ample spare parts" around the UK and continental Europe, said 
Michael O'Leary, chief executive. But he conceded a no-deal Brexit would create problems "in terms of moving 
spare engines and wheels" across the continent's land borders, because "you can't fly some of these bigger parts 
around".
An interruption to supply chains would "certainly be inconvenient and would hit passengers", he said, and these 
problems would not arise if the UK parliament avoided a no-deal Brexit.
EasyJet hoards spare parts in Brexit planning Airlines
Ryanair confirmed on Monday that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, UK investors would not be able to buy its 
shares because of rules requiring EU airlines to be more than 50 per cent EU-owned to retain flying rights around 
the bloc.
Mr O'Leary said a no-deal Brexit would reduce the EU ownership share from 55 per cent to 45 per cent - and that 
UK investors would be likely to be blocked from buying new shares until later this year. "Given the normal flow of 
share sales we think it takes about four months for the 45 per cent EU shareholding to move back up above the 50 
per cent EU shareholding," he said.
Ryanair would restore voting rights once EU investors reached 55 per cent, which Mr O'Leary estimated would be a 
further four months. He also said that the airline would embark on a share buyback in the event of no-deal.

THE FTSE 100 kicked off a week of key Brexit votes in parliament on a positive note, with financial stocks 
shrugging off fears of a potentially disruptive no-deal divorce while mining companies found their support from 
higher zinc prices.
The main index added 0.4 per cent, shaving off some earlier gains as sterling strengthened, and the FTSE 250 was 
0.2 per cent higher.
After trading initially in the red, the pound gained ground as investors awaited parliamentary votes on Prime 
Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal that could decide on what terms -- if at all - Britain leaves the European Union in 
less than three weeks.
Challenger banks Onesavings and Charter Court Financial Services both surged about 11 per cent, topping the 
mid-cap index.
The rise marked Onesavings' biggest one-day gain since August 2016 and Charter Court Financial enjoyed its best-
ever day.
An index of financial stocks recorded their best day in a week, rebounding after two sessions of heavy losses on 
Deutschebank and Com-merzbank merger talks.
Even more support came from mining companies, which rose as falling inventories and China's stimulus pledge 
helped metal prices climb, and oil majors that rose after Saudi Arabia stood by OPEC-led supply cuts.
London-listed shares of Ryanair were down 2.1 per cent. The low-cost carrier said its board had passed resolutions 
to protect its EU airline licenses after Brexit. But traders cited concerns about possible disruptions from Brexit even 
despite the contingency plans.
Stocks rise at start of crunch week for Brexit LONDON REPORT
Shipping services provider Clarkson slumped 12.5 per cent on its worst day in a year given lower earnings and a 
cautious outlook for financial segment.
Cairn Energy tumbled 11 per cent to its biggest one-day decline in four years after saying it expected a delay in the 
timetable for an award in relation to its proceedings against India. Builder Kier Group dropped 12 per cent on the 
small cap index after forecasting higher debt for 2018.

 The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday released a global notice informing airline companies of its 
confidence in the "continued airworthiness" of Boeing's (BA) 737 Max fleet a day after an Ethiopian Airlines plane 
crashed six minutes after take-off in Adis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board.
The incident is being likened to the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max jet which killed all 189 passengers in October of last 
year. The Ethiopian air crash compelled airline companies around the world to ground their 737 Max fleets. Shares 
of Boeing were 5% lower on Monday in the wake of the tragedy.
The agency said that it had just begun its investigation and that there was no conclusive evidence to link the 
Ethiopian plane crash with the incident in Indonesia. 
Despite the agency's assurances, several airline companies have ordered the suspension of 737 Max flights, 
among them Grupo Aeromexico SAB and Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, Bloomberg News reported.
Reuters quoted an Irish newspaper saying that Ryanair (RYAAY) would take no action on 737 MAX orders.

SHARES in Boeing lost as much as 12 per cent of their value during trading on Wall Street yesterday, as some 
airlines grounded planes following a fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash involving the firm's 737 Max Eight passenger jet 
on Sunday.
China's airline regulator called for all Boeing 787 Max Eight domestic flights to be suspended, while Ethiopian 
Airlines and Cayman Airways both grounded the model. The plane crashed shortly after taking off from Addis 
Ababa on Sunday, killing all 149 passengers and eight crew members.
However, in a vote of confidence for the aircraft firm, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the Irish 
Independent newspaper his firm was not planning to make any changes to its upcoming delivery from Boeing.
Ryanair has ordered 135 of the 737 Max 200 planes, a modified version of the Max Eight, and has options on 75 
more.
The fatal crash followed a similar incident in October last year, when a Lion Air flight using the same model crashed 
shortly after taking off from Jakarta, killing 189 people.
Shares in Boeing closed the session down more than five per cent down, wiping over $12.4bn (£9.4bn) off its total 
market capitalisation.

The "combination should prove materially value enhancing for both sets of shareholders," said Investec, while Peel

Cairn Energy retreated after the arbitration panel judging its $1.4bn tax dispute with the Indian government said it 
was unable to give guidance on the expected timing for a decision. Cairn said to expect the judgment by late 2019.
Ryanair weakened after setting out contingency rules for hard Brexit that would see EU shareholders restricted.
Construction group Kier slid after warning that its net debt position at the 2018 year-end was too low by around 
£50m because of an accounting error. The news "further dents management's credibility following December's 
surprise rights issue, and is a backward step in rebuilding confidence in the group's balance sheet position," said

Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary would like a woman to take over as head of the group’s mainline 
operation, although his preference for an internal candidate appears to limit his options.
Explaining at the A4E Summit in Brussels on 6 March that he expected the new chief executive to be in place by 
year-end, O’Leary expressed a desire to “break from the past”. At the same time, however, he suggests that a 
current Ryanair employee is the most likely appointee.
“If I had a choice, I’d have a female, just because that would be a very significant break with the past in Ryanair,” he 
says, adding that he thinks “it’s likely to be an internal candidate, because they understand the business”.
Of the nine “senior executives” listed on Ryanair’s website, just one is a woman: chief risk officer Carol Sharkey.
“I would want somebody who has the opposite of my limited skillset,” says O’Leary. “So, somebody female, 
empathetic, caring, kind. As opposed to a rapacious bastard like me for the last 30 years. I think it would be very 
good for the company.”
He clarifies that the process to identify the new mainline chief executive will not be started until Ryanair has 
released its full-year results.
“The plan is, we’ll advertise internally and externally, do the full-year results in May, we’ll run the ads at that stage, 
we’ll recruit some time in September and October and look to have them in place by the end of the year,” he says.
O’Leary suggests that an external candidate is unlikely to take up the role unless an “exceptional” person applies.
As part of a restructuring at Ryanair, O’Leary is stepping up to a group chief executive role.

The Lufthansa-owned carrier says that from April it will step up flights to Hamburg, Berlin and Dusseldorf from the 
Austrian capital. In May, Austrian will boost frequencies to Paris and Copenhagen.
Chief commercial officer Andreas Otto says the airline is seeking to offer "a low fare and reliability" to customers, as 
opposed to the "low fare and programmed trouble" offered by rivals. He cites "the frequent changes in the flight 
schedule on the part of new competitors".
In reference the airline's promised "sharp drop in airfares", Otto states: "Customers will be pleased, our competitors 
probably less so.".
Ryanair-owned Laudamotion, IAG budget arm Level and Wizz Air all began operating services from Vienna last 
year and have disclosed plans to grow their operations there this year. Austrian's sister airline Eurowings also flies 
from the airport.
Cirium schedules data shows that on the Vienna-Paris route Austrian will be joined by Air France, Level, Transavia 
France, Laudamotion and Vueling this summer. Austrian, Eurowings and Level all serve Hamburg from Vienna. 
Austrian competes with EasyJet to Berlin and Eurowings to Dusseldorf, while Laudamotion and Level are rivals on 
the Copenhagen route.
Austrian says its passengers numbers grew 7% in January 2019, when an additional 60,000 people flew with it. The 
carrier's passenger numbers grew by 1 million last year.

Wizz blames record flight delays on air traffic control Airlines

The chief executive of Hungarian carrier Wizz Air has said Europe's air traffic control system is "bleeding from every 
wound" after it had the worst delays to flights on record last year.
Jozsef Varadi called the system's failures "ridiculous" and "outrageous" and blamed air traffic controller strikes in 
France, staff shortages in Germany and a lack of co-operation between national authorities across Europe as 
delays reached a total of 19.1m minutes last year, double that of 2017.
"If you look at the disruption issues behind last summer," he said, "basically it's been very much driven by ATC [air 
traffic control] dysfunctioning."
Mr Varadi said he was "not expecting a significant improvement" this summer, but added that Wizz was improving 
its resilience by putting more slack into its system, such as spare planes.
At trade body Airlines for Europe's conference in Brussels last week, chief executives from major groups such as 
IAG, which owns British Airways, and Ryanair also criticised the ATC system. Willie Walsh, IAG's chief executive, 
called the system "archaic" and said: "European air traffic control is inefficient and starved of proper resources and 
staffing."
Another source of disruption for European carriers is the UK's exit from the EU. Wizz Air has already been forcing 
new non-EU investors to sell shares so it can maintain its European flying rights, a prelude to potentially largescale 
disenfranchisements by European carriers after Brexit.
Wizz blames record flight delays on air traffic control Airlines
EU regulations stipulate that airlines must have a majority of shareholders based in the bloc in order for the airline 
to fly freely around its member states.
Mr Varadi said Wizz had issued two notices to shareholders "forcing sales of shares" to keep the level of non-EU 
investors below 50 per cent. Wizz issued these restriction notices in September 2016 and April 2018 - the second is 
still in place - and Mr Varadi confirmed it would consider disenfranchisements after a no-deal Brexit, when UK 
shareholders will no longer count as EU investors.
He called it a "fairly well-automated mechanism" which "sounds bigger as a concept than it is in actual reality", but 
conceded that it put downward pressure on the share price by constraining demand. Mr Varadi also said the 
London-listed carrier was looking at using a trust structure to maintain its EU flying rights.
A no-deal Brexit will pose problems for airline groups which have a large proportion of UK and non-EU investors, 
including Ryanair, easyJet and IAG. In a trading update in January, easyJet said it had increased its European 
shareholdings (excluding the UK) from 47 per cent in the last update to 49 per cent, while Ryanair has said it will 
use disenfranchisement to reach the target. US private equity group Indigo Partners owns 21 per cent of Wizz.

Anger over executive pay grabs headlines but climate-related voting and the push for board diversity will be most 
important to investors when the 2019 season of annual meetings begins in the next few weeks.
In the UK, the new corporate governance code will put some executives' length of service and pension 
arrangements under even stronger scrutiny - and fund managers are ready to flex their muscles.
"Even in cases where you don't win, [a protest vote] can still be an interesting temperature gauge," says George 
Dallas, policy director at the International Corporate Governance Network.
FTfm takes a look at the hot-button issues this year.
Executive pay "Executive remuneration always comes up," says Leon Kamhi, head of responsibility at Hermes 
Investment Management. "Consultations [with investors] have become much better over time but three or four 
[cases] pop their heads up every year."
Company annual reports for 2018 are trickling out, so the full picture on pay - and which executives' packages will 
anger investors most - is still forming.

Ryanair's decision to give chief executive Michael O'Leary a bonus of up to (EURO)99m via a share option deal has 
already raised eyebrows.
Royal London Asset Management, a shareholder in the budget airline, decried the potential award as "wholly 
inappropriate" and "ludicrous".
Meanwhile, shareholders at SSP, the travel food retailer, revolted against the £6.2m pay package of chief executive 
Kate Swann. A third of those who voted at the group's AGM last month came out against the remuneration report.
The Investment Association maintains a public register of listed UK companies subject to protest votes and 
publishes a "repeat offenders" list of companies that appear in two consecutive years.
The remuneration report or payrelated issues were cited in 16 out of 33 companies on the list in both 2017 and 
2018.
"A lot of management teams still haven't got it," says one head of stewardship at a large UK asset manager.
Board tenure In January the UK introduced a new rule as part of an overhaul of the corporate governance code that 
requires chairs to step down after serving on the board for nine years. From next year, UK public companies must 
comply with the code or explain why they have not.
Directors who have served well over this limit include Tim Martin, founder of JD Wetherspoon, who has been 
chairman of the pub chain for 36 years, and Michael Dobson, chairman at Schroders, who joined its board as a 
non-executive in 2001.
Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Minerva, the stewardship consultancy, does not expect to see many protest votes 
on the issue this year. "You normally see a couple of years' lag because it takes time to work its way through the 
system," she says. There may still be some dissent: "Fund managers make their own decisions."
There is already disquiet. Investors holding nearly a fifth of shares voted against the re-election of Mark Williamson, 
chairman of Imperial Brands and on the board for 12 years, at the group's recent AGM. The tobacco group is 
hunting for a successor.
Mike Turner, chairman of Babcock, announced in January that he would step down from the FTSE 250 defence 
group, citing the code and the views of two top-20 shareholders who told him the company would have more 
credibility if he resigned. He has chaired the board for a decade.
Mr Kamhi, however, indicates that Hermes, which manages £34bn of assets, is open-minded on board service.
"What we're looking for is a board that functions well, which has the right skills but is not a club. There's an idea that 
if you've been there too long you've gone native," he says.
He says it would not be a dealbreaker if there were one or two longer-serving directors on a board. "They've seen 
the history, they know what's in the cupboards. We don't want it religiously enforced."
Mr Martin recently told the Financial Times he believed the nine-year rule was "deeply flawed".
Board diversity After years of slow progress on gender diversity at board level, some investors are planning to call 
out the laggards this season.
The Church Investors Group (CIG), a Christian coalition that controls assets of £21bn, has signalled a tougher 
stance at investee companies.
The CIG will vote against the chair of the nominations committee of companies on major indices in Europe, the US, 
Australia and New Zealand unless they have at least one female director.
Five hot-button topics to watch for ANALYSIS AGM SEASON ; GOVERNANCE Pay, diversity and climate will 
vie for attention, says Jennifer Thompson
This is an extension of its targeting British companies on the issue, where the CIG expects at least a third of board 
members to be women.
"We've been increasing our expectations of boards on gender diversity," says Edward Mason, head of responsible 
investment at the Church Commissioners.
Last year it flagged the issue and voted against director elections at more than 136 companies and Mr Mason says 
it will take "a really tough line" on FTSE 100 companies where less than a quarter of directors are women.
Board diversity was one of the priorities for 2019 AGMs in a survey of governance specialists conducted by 
researchers from EY, the professional services firm.
Over half of more than 60 institutional investors said "board diversity, primarily inclusive of gender, race and 
ethnicity, should be a top board focus in 2019".
Climate change "We're seeing climate change feature heavily in this year's season," says Mr Mason.
BP has already side-stepped shareholder anger by agreeing to disclose how its spending and strategy align with 
the Paris climate agreement. It took action ahead of a motion co-filed by ShareAction, the responsible investment 
group, Hermes EOS, Aviva Investors, M&G Investments and Legal & General Investment Management.
Its position contrasts with that of ExxonMobil, which has called on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to 
try to block an investor proposal calling for it to set targets for greenhouse gas emissions.
The US oil group says it is already cutting emissions and that the proposal, led by the pension fund for New York 
state and backed by Calpers and the Church of England, is an attempt to "micromanage the company".
Ms Wilson says the outcomes highlight how European companies are "better attuned" to having conversations with 
shareholders. "One's a British company, one's a US company," she says. "There is a stark contrast in how dialogue 
and engagement operates between the two markets."
Executive pensions Investors are paying more attention to lavish pension deals that further exacerbate the 
difference in income between executives and workers. In part this reflects increasing scrutiny of remuneration but 
the revamped UK corporate governance code includes a stipulation that executives' pension contribution rates 
should be "aligned with those available to the workforce". "There's [more] sensitivity to unequal pay standards 
within companies," says Mr Dallas.
The Investment Association recently wrote to remuneration chairs at FTSE 350 companies. "The pension 
contributions for current executive directors should be reduced over time to equal the rate received by the majority 
of the workforce," said Andrew Ninian, IA director of corporate governance. "Shareholders expect that no 
compensation will be awarded for this change."
"What investors want to see and what we want to see ... is that pensions are in line with the wider workforce," says 
Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at Hermes EOS, which advises on £389bn of assets. "If [executive pensions 
are] materially out of line and it's a new package, that could well be something we'd vote against."

Five hot-button topics to watch for ANALYSIS AGM SEASON ; GOVERNANCE Pay, diversity and climate will 
vie for attention, says Jennifer Thompson
Ryanair's decision to give chief executive Michael O'Leary a bonus of up to (EURO)99m via a share option deal has 
already raised eyebrows.
Royal London Asset Management, a shareholder in the budget airline, decried the potential award as "wholly 
inappropriate" and "ludicrous".
Meanwhile, shareholders at SSP, the travel food retailer, revolted against the £6.2m pay package of chief executive 
Kate Swann. A third of those who voted at the group's AGM last month came out against the remuneration report.
The Investment Association maintains a public register of listed UK companies subject to protest votes and 
publishes a "repeat offenders" list of companies that appear in two consecutive years.
The remuneration report or payrelated issues were cited in 16 out of 33 companies on the list in both 2017 and 
2018.
"A lot of management teams still haven't got it," says one head of stewardship at a large UK asset manager.
Board tenure In January the UK introduced a new rule as part of an overhaul of the corporate governance code that 
requires chairs to step down after serving on the board for nine years. From next year, UK public companies must 
comply with the code or explain why they have not.
Directors who have served well over this limit include Tim Martin, founder of JD Wetherspoon, who has been 
chairman of the pub chain for 36 years, and Michael Dobson, chairman at Schroders, who joined its board as a 
non-executive in 2001.
Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Minerva, the stewardship consultancy, does not expect to see many protest votes 
on the issue this year. "You normally see a couple of years' lag because it takes time to work its way through the 
system," she says. There may still be some dissent: "Fund managers make their own decisions."
There is already disquiet. Investors holding nearly a fifth of shares voted against the re-election of Mark Williamson, 
chairman of Imperial Brands and on the board for 12 years, at the group's recent AGM. The tobacco group is 
hunting for a successor.
Mike Turner, chairman of Babcock, announced in January that he would step down from the FTSE 250 defence 
group, citing the code and the views of two top-20 shareholders who told him the company would have more 
credibility if he resigned. He has chaired the board for a decade.
Mr Kamhi, however, indicates that Hermes, which manages £34bn of assets, is open-minded on board service.
"What we're looking for is a board that functions well, which has the right skills but is not a club. There's an idea that 
if you've been there too long you've gone native," he says.
He says it would not be a dealbreaker if there were one or two longer-serving directors on a board. "They've seen 
the history, they know what's in the cupboards. We don't want it religiously enforced."
Mr Martin recently told the Financial Times he believed the nine-year rule was "deeply flawed".
Board diversity After years of slow progress on gender diversity at board level, some investors are planning to call 
out the laggards this season.
The Church Investors Group (CIG), a Christian coalition that controls assets of £21bn, has signalled a tougher 
stance at investee companies.
The CIG will vote against the chair of the nominations committee of companies on major indices in Europe, the US, 
Australia and New Zealand unless they have at least one female director.
Five hot-button topics to watch for ANALYSIS AGM SEASON ; GOVERNANCE Pay, diversity and climate will 
vie for attention, says Jennifer Thompson
This is an extension of its targeting British companies on the issue, where the CIG expects at least a third of board 
members to be women.
"We've been increasing our expectations of boards on gender diversity," says Edward Mason, head of responsible 
investment at the Church Commissioners.
Last year it flagged the issue and voted against director elections at more than 136 companies and Mr Mason says 
it will take "a really tough line" on FTSE 100 companies where less than a quarter of directors are women.
Board diversity was one of the priorities for 2019 AGMs in a survey of governance specialists conducted by 
researchers from EY, the professional services firm.
Over half of more than 60 institutional investors said "board diversity, primarily inclusive of gender, race and 
ethnicity, should be a top board focus in 2019".
Climate change "We're seeing climate change feature heavily in this year's season," says Mr Mason.
BP has already side-stepped shareholder anger by agreeing to disclose how its spending and strategy align with 
the Paris climate agreement. It took action ahead of a motion co-filed by ShareAction, the responsible investment 
group, Hermes EOS, Aviva Investors, M&G Investments and Legal & General Investment Management.
Its position contrasts with that of ExxonMobil, which has called on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to 
try to block an investor proposal calling for it to set targets for greenhouse gas emissions.
The US oil group says it is already cutting emissions and that the proposal, led by the pension fund for New York 
state and backed by Calpers and the Church of England, is an attempt to "micromanage the company".
Ms Wilson says the outcomes highlight how European companies are "better attuned" to having conversations with 
shareholders. "One's a British company, one's a US company," she says. "There is a stark contrast in how dialogue 
and engagement operates between the two markets."
Executive pensions Investors are paying more attention to lavish pension deals that further exacerbate the 
difference in income between executives and workers. In part this reflects increasing scrutiny of remuneration but 
the revamped UK corporate governance code includes a stipulation that executives' pension contribution rates 
should be "aligned with those available to the workforce". "There's [more] sensitivity to unequal pay standards 
within companies," says Mr Dallas.
The Investment Association recently wrote to remuneration chairs at FTSE 350 companies. "The pension 
contributions for current executive directors should be reduced over time to equal the rate received by the majority 
of the workforce," said Andrew Ninian, IA director of corporate governance. "Shareholders expect that no 
compensation will be awarded for this change."
"What investors want to see and what we want to see ... is that pensions are in line with the wider workforce," says 
Bruce Duguid, head of stewardship at Hermes EOS, which advises on £389bn of assets. "If [executive pensions 
are] materially out of line and it's a new package, that could well be something we'd vote against."

 Ryanair (RYAAY) said pre-market Monday that the board has passed a resolution to restrict the voting rights of 
British shareholders if the UK exits the European Union without an agreement on future relations.
The move to restrict British shareholders' rights is to ensure the budget carrier remains majority EU-owned and to 
protect its European operating licenses after the UK leaves the EU, the company said in a statement.
Non-EU shareholders, including those from the UK after March 29, will also be barred from voting or taking part at 
any Ryanair general meeting, the Irish-based low-fare airline company added.

RYANAIR boss Michael O'Leary can afford to shop at Harrods rather than Primark, but it is one of his bargain-
basement equine purchases who is likely to grab the headlines at this week's Cheltenham Festival.
Tiger Roll is no oil-painting. In fact, O'Leary once described him as "a little rat of a thing".
However, his brother Eddie, who is entrusted with the cheque book at the thoroughbred sales, saw enough of this 
pocket-sized gelding as a threeyear-old to purchase him for the powerful Gigginstown House Stud.
Have a look at Tiger Roll yourself in the paddock before he defends his crown in the Glenfarclas Cross Country 
Chase on Wednesday.
You would never have guessed that this little fella would make those supposedly formidable fences at Aintree last 
year resemble dandy brushes as he sailed over Becher's Brook and The Chair en route to a glorious Grand 
National victory.
They might put a statue up at Cheltenham one day, and possibly Aintree, too.
Winning three races at the Festival is one thing, but when they are all so completely different, it beggars' belief.
Triumph Hurdle maybe, four-mile National Hunt Chase no way and then the unique Glenfarclas Cross Country as a 
stepping-stone to success in the greatest steeplechase on the globe at Aintree. Bring on the men in white coats.
TIGER IS ON AN UNSTOPPABLE ROLL Geoff Lester on Tiger Roll ahead of his tilt at a fourth Cheltenham 
Festival success
Like another Aintree hero, the legendary Red Rum, Tiger Roll was bred to be a Flat horse.
He was sired by Derby winner Authorized and bought by Godolphin for 70,000gns at the Tattersalls Yearling Sales.
The Tiger never ran for the boys in blue and 12 months later was bought by West Country jumps trainer Nigel 
Hawke, himself an Aintree hero, having ridden Seagram to victory in the National in 1991.
Hawke struck lucky at the first time of asking when Tiger Roll won a small race at Market Rasen on his debut.
However, the trainer immediately cashed in his chips and made a quick killing, sending him back to the sales, 
where O'Leary bought him for £80,000.
"I bought him thinking he might have a squeak in a race like the Fred Winter," said O'Leary reflecting on arguably 
his best-ever purchase."But when he finished second to Guitar Pete on his first run for us at Leopardstown, we 
rerouted him for the Grade One Triumph Hurdle at the Festival, and the rest is history!
"He only stands at 15.2 hands, but he's been amazing, simply fantastic and he has endless stamina."
Hopes that winning the Triumph might be a prelude to beating the big boys in the Champion Hurdle proved short-
lived, as Tiger Roll's limitations as a timber-topper were exposed by Hurricane Fly and company in the Irish 
equivalent.
"He was falling between two stools at the hurdling game," said O'Leary taking up the story.
"So, we felt we had nothing to lose by trying him over fences, despite his lack of size."
Tiger Roll might not be built for chasing, but he has shown he is nimble at the larger obstacles, and, though he can 
sometimes be too brave for his own good, he seems to have that sixth sense in that he knows at which fences he 
can take liberties and which he can't.
Having won his first two races at Ballinrobe and Kilbeggan, Tiger Roll convinced trainer Gordon Elliott that he 
"might be half-decent", and when they stepped him up in distance he bolted up at Limerick. Therefore, what 
seemed to some a crazy plan for a Triumph Hurdle winner was duly hatched, with the longest race at the Festival 
earmarked as his spring target.
Yet, despite arriving at Cheltenham without having seen a racecourse in five months, Tiger Roll survived a few hairy 
moments over the 25 fences and gave amateur Lisa O'Neill a moment she will never forget when scoring at 16/1. 
Where shall we go next pondered Elliott and the O'Learys, and it was decided to try Tiger Roll on the Cross Country 
course at Cheltenham, a unique race with its twists and turns, taking in banks, ditches, rails and even a cheese-
wedge.
The Tiger looked somewhat mystified when he tried it out at the December meeting, but he got around safely and 
when he went back for the Glenfarclassponsored marathon at the Festival he was far more streetwise and duly 
dotted up.
However, when the O'Learys revealed in the Cheltenham winner's enclosure that the National was the aim, the 
press corps thought they had misheard the comment.
We ought to have known better. Apart from having his jockey knocked over in a melee at the second last at Galway 
one day, Tiger Roll had never been on the floor in 30 races, so even a first ever trip to Liverpool was not going to 
send him scurrying for the worry-beads.
Davy Russell still becomes emotional when he reflects on that Aintree glory. "I wouldn't have been surprised if he 
had fallen at the first fence as he can be shockingly brave, but at the start he was so focused that I knew we were in 
business. What a day!" Dismissed as a 25/1 no-hoper when he returned from his winter break in a hurdle race at 
TIGER IS ON AN UNSTOPPABLE ROLL Geoff Lester on Tiger Roll ahead of his tilt at a fourth Cheltenham 
Festival success
Navan last month, Tiger Roll never broke sweat, clocking up a 10th career success and taking his earnings to just 
shy of £1 million.
He is back chasing more of Glenfarclas' money this week and is odds-on this time. Even the bookmakers have 
learned to respect one of the most popular jump horses in training.

Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said his combative reputation had been a negative distraction for the 
airline and was part of the reason he was stepping back from the day-to-day running of the airline.
Mr O'Leary said: "I think one of the negatives of Ryanair is its association with me. I'm an easy person to target ... 
Too much of the negativity that attracts itself to Ryanair attaches itself because of something stupid I said 25 years 
ago."
Mr O'Leary has courted controversy throughout his career.
He once claimed "hell will freeze over" before he would recognise trade unions. He has drawn criticism over a 
potential (EURO)99m bonus, and has had to defend the airline's chairman, David Bonderman, who has been in 
post for more than 20 years, against an investor revolt.
In a new role as head of Ryanair Holdings, Mr O'Leary will oversee the chiefs of the main Ryanair carrier, as well as 
Laudamotion (based in Austria), Ryanair Sun (Poland) and Ryanair UK, the entity formed to surmount obstacles 
thrown up by Brexit.
O'Leary confesses he is a Ryanair 'negative'; Airlines ; Chief says need now is to 'shut up and deliver' as he 
prepares for move upstairs
He will be responsible for decisions including M&A opportunities, costs, and buying aircraft. But he will no longer be 
at the forefront of Ryanair's day-to-day affairs. He said the move was a chance to "reboot" the company's reputation 
as it introduced improvements from a customer charter.
"What we need to do for the next year, certainly through 2019, is shut up and deliver," he said. "In the past, we 
might have spent too much time talking about it and not enough time delivering it."
In the three months to December 2018, Ryanair made a "disappointing" (EURO)22m pre-tax loss, a swing from a 
(EURO)113m profit the year before. Revenue for the quarter rose 9 per cent to (EURO)1.53bn, and it reaffirmed 
January's warning that full-year profit would be in the range of (EURO)1bn-(EURO)1.1bn.
Mr O'Leary said Ryanair was keen to raise the number of female pilots it employed, currently 4 per cent, which led 
to a gender pay gap of 72 per cent last year, worst in the sector. He wanted to double the number of female pilots in 
the next three years, but the gender pay measurement, as devised by the government, was "not a meaningful 
figure. It's entirely bogus ... This entirely arbitrary, meaningless number". What was critical, he said was "that you 
have equal pay. We pay our male cabin crew exactly what we pay our female cabin crew. We pay our female pilots 
exactly what we pay our male pilots."
Ryanair is looking at establishing an apprenticeship scheme for female pilots in the next 12-18 months, Mr O'Leary 
said, adding that 10 per cent of new pilots were female.

Two of Europe's biggest airline groups would like to see more women taking up engineering and pilot roles, but cite 
a lack of female applicants that is making progress tough.
"We are still finding that when we advertise for jobs we are getting 70%, 80% male applicants," said IAG chief 
executive Willie Walsh during a panel discussion at the A4E Aviation Summit in Brussels on 6 March. "It should be 
50:50. And I can't understand why it wouldn't be 50:50, other than we are just not yet convincing young women that 
aviation holds opportunities for them."
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary says his airline likewise finds that applicants for pilot roles tend to be 
overwhelmingly male. "We do recruitment days for pilot cadets – it's 90% male and 10% female," he says. "You do 
a recruitment day for cabin crew, it's the other way around: it's 80-20 female-male. We need to encourage more 
women to consider [airline] pilot as a career."
He argues: "There’s nothing wrong with the gender balance in aviation. In fact, it’s heavily skewed towards females, 
but they are generally on the cabin-crew side."
At the same event, Boeing's senior vice-president of commercial sales and marketing Ihssane Mounir suggested 
that the airframer had found some success in improving the gender balance in engineering roles by educating girls 
about careers in aviation from a young age.
"It had to be a deliberate plan to do it," Mounir says. "You had to go work at the lower levels, the high-school levels, 
before high-school levels, and get young ladies very interested in the engineering world and making sure that they 
feel comfortable doing it.

"I've got two young daughters and at the weekends I take them to the factory and show them around," he adds. 
"They too can do this."
Walsh agrees that the "fascinating challenge" of attracting more women into the industry can only be addressed by 
convincing young girls to consider a career in aviation.
"We're out there in the schools – and you've got to get into the schools because we've got to get them at an early 
age get them thinking about aviation, get them thinking about engineering, get them thinking about flying as 
opportunities for them.
"This is a job that everybody needs to participate in," Walsh adds. "We have a responsibility to talk about the 
opportunities and make sure that what has been historically seen as a male-dominated industry addresses that."
He cites the example of the pilot gender mix at Aer Lingus. The carrier recruited its first female pilot in 1977, Walsh 
recalls, and about one in 10 such positions today are filled by women.
"It has taken over 40 years to get from zero to 10%," he says. "It is unacceptable, but there is no simple, easy 
solution."
The pay and conditions afforded to pilots should, in O'Leary's view, make the role "a great career for someone with 
a family".
He notes: "You do five [days] on, four off... You are limited to 900 hours a year – 18-and-a-half hours a week – and 
you get paid 200 grand a year. We need to communicate that message more actively to women."
O'Leary – whose airline has been mired in negotiations with pilot unions across Europe in recent months – 
concludes: "If we had more female pilots, you'd have a generally more sensible pilot body anyway, because women 
tend to be more intelligent and more sensible than men at the best of times."

THE UK government has said it will match the EU's offer to protect flying rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit, 
allowing planes to take off unhindered after 29 March.
The Department for Transport (DFT) said yesterday it had "adopted this approach to provide reassurance and 
minimise disruption - providing a cushion during which future air services arrangements can be negotiated". The 
deal comes after the EU announced last December that flights from the UK into and over the EU would be allowed 
for 12 months to enable "basic connectivity" if the UK leaves the bloc without a deal.
As well as the 12-month guarantee, the EU proposed that regulation be extended by about nine months to ensure 
that certain aviation licences remain valid.
"The UK believes restrictions on ownership and control in aviation are outdated, and do not reflect the reality of the 
global capital markets," the DFT said.
The government said the proposals were a no-deal contingency measure and would only come into force if it failed 
to reach a negotiated withdrawal from the EU.
The announcement was welcomed by airlines, who said it gave passengers and cargo operators "certainty and 
confidence".
Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents airlines including Easyjet, Ryanair and British 
Airways, said: "We welcome that the UK has confirmed its plans to allow flights to continue in a no-deal scenario, 
as the EU has also done.
Flying rights to be protected in no-deal Brexit
"This gives passengers and cargo operators the certainty and confidence that they can continue to fly as normal 
after the UK has left the EU."

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary would like a woman to take over as head of the group's mainline operation, 
although his preference for an internal candidate appears to limit his options in this regard.
Explaining at the A4E Summit in Brussels on 6 March that he expected the new chief executive to be in place by 
year-end, O'Leary expressed a desire to "break from the past". At the same time, however, he suggests that a 
current Ryanair employee is the most likely appointee.
"If I had a choice, I'd have a female, just because that would be a very significant break with the past in Ryanair," he 
says, adding that he thinks "it's likely to be an internal candidate, because they understand the business".
Of the nine "senior executives" listed on Ryanair's website, just one is a woman: chief risk officer Carol Sharkey.
"I would want somebody who has the opposite of my limited skillset," says O'Leary. "So, somebody female, 
empathetic, caring, kind. As opposed to a rapacious bastard like me for the last 30 years. I think it would be very 
good for the company."
He clarifies that the process to identify the new mainline chief executive will not begin until Ryanair has released its 
full-year results.
"The plan is, we'll advertise internally and externally, do the full-year results in May, we'll run the ads at that stage, 
we'll recruit sometime in September and October and have them in place by the end of the year," he says.
O'Leary suggests that an external candidate is unlikely to take up the role unless an "exceptional" person applies.
E O'Leary would like woman to lead Ryanair mainline Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary would like a 
woman to take over as head of the group's mainline oper....
As part of a restructuring at Ryanair, O'Leary is stepping up to a group chief executive role. Eventually, the heads of 
Ryanair mainline, Laudamotion and to-be-renamed Ryanair Sun will report to him. There are also tentative plans for 
a Ryanair UK unit, depending on the outcome of Brexit negotiations.

Many a true word is spoken in jest, they say.
That phrase was perhaps pertinent during the closing chief executive panel at the A4E Summit on 6 March.
"Imagine you could take over the airline of one of your co-panellists for one week. Which one and why?" asked 
moderator Richard Quest, to laughter from an expectant audience.
Big shoes to fill?
Ed Telling Photography
Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr was first to respond.
"I would take Willie's job because I am jealous of his home market in London," he replies in reference to IAG's 
British Airways, playing it relatively safe.
IAG chief Willie Walsh did not chose such a safe answer, however, instead picking a topic that his often been the 
subject of industry rumours.
"I would take KLM and spend that week convincing them that they should be part of IAG," he says.
But Walsh won't be doing a job swap with KLM chief executive Pieter Elbers. Instead, the latter says he fancies the 
idea of running a low-cost competitor.
"I would take Ryanair and I would show customers that they could really have an enjoyable journey if they pay a 
few pounds more," he states.
O'Leary joins KLM ? Europe's airline chiefs pick fantasy job-swaps "Imagine you could take over the airline of 
one of your co-panellists for one week. Which one....
This prompts Ryanair chief Michael O’Leary to rethink his answer.
"I’ve changed my mind in the last few seconds. I was originally going to say Carsten so I could [experience] what it 
feels like to own Germany, Austria and Switzerland," O’Leary says.
"[But] I’ve changed [to KLM], so that I can encourage the Dutch government to buy more of Air France," he 
continues, in reference to earlier comments that state investment in an airline is bad for the respective business and 
therefore benefits Ryanair.
And what of EasyJet’s chief executive, Johan Lundgren?
"I’d take all of them," he says, to more laughs from the audience.
"I noticed that nobody wanted to take [EasyJet]," he then observes, adding that he had decided to take that as "a 
massive compliment".

 Ryanair (RYAAY) is in early talks with Airbus for a future order of about 100 A321 aircraft for its recently acquired 
Laudamotion subsidiary, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing CEO Michael O'Leary.
"With Airbus we are talking about the possibility of A321s for Laudamotion but that is at the very initial stages," said 
O'Leary at the sidelines of a conference in Brussels. An order of at least 100 aircraft would be worth over $6.5 
billion.
The airline is also interested in the Boeing (BA) 737 Max 10 for its all-Boeing main fleet "at the right price," but not 
at this time, O'Leary told Reuters in an interview. The main fleet will remain exclusively Boeing, the CEO said.

Ryanair has breached Italian labour laws by evading social security and bonus payments for its airport staff, 
according to Italy's labour inspection agency.
"Serious violations" were documented during the course of 2014 at more than a dozen Italian airports served by the 
low-cost Irish airline, the agency said in a statement.
Ryanair was accused of having made "illicit recourse" to about 600 third-party workers to save on insurance, 
pension and bonus payments it would have had to pay to in-house staff.
The illegal conduct took place at airports in Bari, Bergamo, Pisa, Rome, Brindisi, Cagliari, Catania, Lamezia Terme, 
Milan Malpensa, Palermo, Pescara, Alghero and Trapani, according to the agency.
The airline was asked to pay 9.2 million euros (10.4 million dollars) in unpaid labour charges and fines, and 
investigators said they are now probing Ryanair's labour practices in the years following 2014.

BUDGET airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air reported boosted traffic year-on-year in February, but both carriers saw 
passenger numbers drop compared to the previous month.
A total of 9.3m customers flew with Ryanair in February, an increase of 13 per cent from 8.6m the previous year.
However, passenger numbers fell from 10.3m the previous month.
Wizz Air had 2.54m customers last month, up from 2.33m in February 2018, but saw a decline in passengers from 
2.56m in January this year.
Ryanair reported a load factor of 96 per cent, up one per cent on the previous year, while Wizz Air said its load 
factor was 94.2 per cent, up from 91.2 per cent.
City Index senior market analyst Fiona Cincotta said "the outlook seems to be improving", after several months of 
negative news for European airlines, which included budget airlines Cobalt and Primera Air falling into 
administration and Slovenian national carrier Adria Airways teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
"Overcapacity, higher oil prices, strikes and political events like Brexit have all left their mark but the issues, apart 
from Brexit, are slowly being resolved," she said.
Cincotta added that the numbers provided yesterday by budget carriers Ryanair and Wizz Air "indicate a new trend, 
with both companies showing double digit annual increases in passenger figures".
Last month, Ryanair announced it had suffered a (EURO)20m (£17.2m) loss in the third quarter of the financial year 
due to weaker ticket prices, while Wizz Air reported an 88 per cent drop in pre-tax profits at the end of 2018.

Shares in both Ryanair and Wizz Air ended fairly flat yesterday, rising 0.63 and 0.95 per cent respectively.

 Stock prices in London are seen opening higher on Monday, tracking strong gains in Asia, amid optimism that a 
trade deal between the US and China is within sight. 
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index will open 26.37 points higher at 7,133.10. The blue chip index closed 2.00 
points, or 0.5%, at 7,106.73 Friday. 
Sentiment was given a boost after the Wall Street Journal over the weekend reported that the US and China are 
close to reaching a trade deal that could lift US tariffs on imports from China. The newspaper said China is offering 
to lower tariffs on US products in categories ranging from farms to chemicals and autos.
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 1.0% in response. In China, the Shanghai Composite is up 1.1%, while 
the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong is up 0.7%.
"After months of trade tensions, the world's two largest economies are reportedly nearing a trade deal which would 
remove US tariffs on Chinese imports," said London Capital Group's Jasper Lawler.
"Markets are a sea of green as the new week kicks off. Trade deal optimism sent Asian markets sharply higher, 
whilst European and US futures are pointing to a strong start out of the blocks on the opening bell."
In the US on Friday, Wall Street ended higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.4%, S&P 500 up 0.7% 
and Nasdaq Composite up 0.8%.
The pound was quoted at USD1.3232 early Monday, marginally higher from USD1.3222 at the London equities 
close Friday. 
In political news, UK Prime Minister Theresa May was given a Brexit boost as key Tories signalled swinging behind 
her stance in exchange for movement on the Northern Irish backstop.
LONDON MARKET EARLY CALL: Higher Call On Hopes Of US -China Trade Deal
Chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench Tories Graham Brady expressed optimism that a 
breakthrough on the backstop was close.
The hardline European Research Group of Tory MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg also indicated a more conciliatory 
tone on the issue.
The ERG has drawn up "three tests" the government must pass to win backing, according to the Sunday Times.
A light economic events calendar on Monday has eurozone producer prices at 1000 GMT.
On Thursday this week, the European Central Bank will announce its latest interest rate decision. The central bank 
is widely expected to keep monetary policy unchanged. 
On Friday, there is the US jobs report for February due. 
The UK corporate calendar on Monday has full-year results from valve actuators manufacturer Rotork, speciality 
chemicals company Synthomer, engineer Senior and geotechnical contractor Keller Group. Also due are February 
traffic statistics from Ryanair.

Europe's biggest budget airline is taking precautions in case of a no-deal Brexit by shifting some of its spare parts 
from a British central storage unit to other EU locations.
Ryanair's director of maintenance and engineering told dpa that Britain's unregulated departure from the European 
Union could make moving parts around difficult because of customs restrictions, for example.
"We're concerned that it could take longer to get spare parts to airports where we need them quickly from the 
central storage in Stansted," Karsten Muehlenfeld said, referring to a London airport.
Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary is an outspoken critic of Brexit, though he says his Irish airline, which is registered in 
the EU and not in Britain, will not be as badly affected as some British-based airlines.

Airline mergers and acquisitions(M&A) and ownership changes arecommon in aviation. These transactions can 
differ greatly between continents andcultures but they also share a number ofcharacteristics.
In Europe, Ryanair is moving to a groupstructure “not dissimilar to that of IAG” as itassigns respective chief 
executive officers(CEOs) to its Ryanair DAC, Ryanair Sun andRyanair UK subsidiaries.
Andrew Herdman, director-general of theAssociation of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA),tells Airfinance Journal that 
Europeanairlines such as IAG and Lufthansa are ableto bring other airlines into their groupsrather than just 
subsidiaries, as is the casein AirAsia and Lion Air groups. He adds thatEuropean carrier ownership structures 
helptheir members invest within groups, but it isquite difficult to have such groups in Asia.
In February, All Nippon Airways (ANA)confirmed it will invest $95 million for a9.5% minority stake in Philippine 
Airlines(PAL), to expand the group’s internationalnetwork and strengthen its partnerships with foreign carriers.
“If you talk about one airline investing inanother airline of a different country, theforeign airline can only have a 
minoritystake, and it cannot have control. This is tocomply with the requirements of bilateral government air 
services agreements. Sothe appetite for buying small stakes inother airlines is not that great, becausewhen you 
have a small stake, you don’thave much influence,” says Herdman, who notes history indicates that purchasinga 
small shareholding from other foreignairlines often does not work out.
Most shakers and movers in the industrythink ownership control regulations shouldbe abandoned. However, this 
wouldoften require changes to air servicesagreements, according to Herdman, as these agreements between 
countriesoften specify that airlines must be majority owned and controlled by nationals of thecountry the airline is 
registered in. “Overall,cross-border M&A activity is quite limited,” he says.
In the interim, there are many formsof cooperation indigenous to theaviation industry. Two airlines that haveno 
ownership overlap at all can signcooperation agreements.
“Airlines have a practice of competingagainst and cooperating with each otherat the same time. They form alliances 
formarket cooperation, feed passengersto each other, conclude various types ofcommercial agreements with each 
other.So historically, there is a lot of cooperationamongst airlines even without investmentin one another,” says 
Herdman.
Asia- Pacific airlines still face M&A challenges
As director-general of AAPA, Herdmanis committed to expanding the role of theassociation as the leading trade 
organisationfor airlines in the Asia-Pacific region.
In Japan, Japan Airlines and ANA stilldominate the market. “The penetration oflow-cost carriers [LCC] in Japan is 
still ratherlow,” he says, adding that the Japanesemarket is a mature and high-income market with high service 
expectations.
“Globally, LCCs constitute about 25%of the total seat capacity, and probablyabout 15% of the revenue. That 
meansfull-service network carriers still generatean overwhelming 85% of the revenuesglobally. We see some long-
haul LLCs.But it’s tough to capture that market fromfull-service carriers, which are already very cost competitive,” 
he adds.Herdmanstresses that most of the revenue is still infull-service, medium- and long-haul carriers,rather than 
LCCs.
Having held the director-general positionin AAPA since November 2004, Herdmanaddresses a wide range of both 
regionaland global policy issues affecting theindustry. He expects that profit margins atAsian airlines in 2018 will be 
similar to 2017levels.
 “Last year, the oil price kept rising for thefirst three quarters and it was very difficultto pass on the high fuel cost to 
passengersin the form of higher average fares. In thefourth quarter, the oil price fell sharply, and that provided 
some relief but we haven’tseen all the results coming through fromthe airlines. The cargo business had avery 
strong 2017, and 2018 still saw somegrowth. But the monthly growth rate hasmoderated somewhat,” says 
Herdman.
According to a Wall Street Journal report,Chinese and US negotiators are focusingon producing a broad outline of a 
tradeagreement ahead of a possible summit inthe coming weeks, indicating there are still substantial gaps between 
what Beijing iswilling to offer and what the US is willing toaccept.
“Until recently I would have said thecustomer sentiment is not too affected,”says Herdman, “but I think 
consumerconfidence is beginning to be affectedin China. In some Asian markets that isalso starting to show, 
affected by theuncertainty of the global economy and theuncertainties arising from trade disputes. That is a concern 
for 2019.

       BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - The European Union needs to better protect aviation workers from exploitation, the 
European Commission said Friday.  The bloc's executive released a report outlining proposals to strengthen labour 
conditions for pilots and cabin crew, including tighter regulation of non-contractual labour and undeclared work, 
which typically do not grant benefits or protections. 
 Among the proposals was convening a group of labour and aviation experts that will advise the commission and 
member states on how to better implement labour laws.  The report comes at a time of rising labour unrest in the 
industry, most notably seen in a series of strikes by Ryanair pilots and cabin crew since mid-2018.  'Increased 
competition, automation and digitalization [have] also had an impact on the workforce, notably through the 
development of atypical forms of employment,' the commission said in a press release.   'This has led to legal 
uncertainty and the risk of disrupting the level playing field among airlines,' it added.  Two million workers in the EU 
are directly employed in the aviation industry, while it supports 9.4 million jobs in total and contributes 110 billion 
euros (125.4 billion dollars) to the bloc's economy, the commission release noted.  Meanwhile, the number of daily 
flights has jumped from under 10,000 in 1992 to around 25,000 in 2017.    The German pilots association 
Vereinigung Cockpit welcomed the commission announcement as a 'long-awaited wake-up call.'   Copyright dpa

Drunk Passenger Tried To Smoke Cigarettes Inside Plane Toilet Repeatedly
Drunk Passenger Tried To Smoke Cigarettes Inside Plane Toilet Repeatedly

Mar 01, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Polish woman 
who was flying to Bristol, England, to look for a new job, was arrested after she got drunk on a Ryanair flight and 
repeatedly tried to smoke cigarettes in the plane's washroom.  Edyta Skubala, 40, was not given any jail time for 
her actions, but was ordered to do 180 hours of community serviceand pay the court total costs of 250 pounds 
($330), which included prosecution costs and a surcharge, Thursday. She had earlier pleaded guilty tobeing drunk 
in an aircraft during an incident that took place in December, Bristol Live reported.[1] The crew members on the 
Ryanair flight were alerted to her actions when another passenger started screaming. 
When flight attendants went over to investigate the matter, they discovered Skubala smoking in the bathroom. She 
was forced to extinguish the cigarette after the attendants told her that she was forbidden from smoking inside the 
plane. However, after 10 minutes, more screaming was heard. Again the attendants traced the source of the 
screaming back to Skubala trying to sneak in a quick smoke inside the washroom - the second time also taking 
swigs from some duty-free liquor that she had bought before boarding the plane. When she was asked for her 
boarding pass, she reportedly screamed at them in Polish to 'f--k off.' Following her unruly behavior, the flight 
attendants made sure that she was only allowed to use the washroom with the doors open, lest she tried to smoke 
again. However, she somehow managed to attempt it two more times. 'There were a further two incidents when the 
defendant tried to smoke thereafter,' prosecutor Clare Fear said. 'So a total of four occasions when the defendant 
tried to light cigarettes whilst on flights.'Katie Wildish, a probation officer, said that Skubala regretted behaving the 
way she did. 'She's absolutely mortified by her behavior. She'd been to the funeral in Poland of her aunt who had 
been her primary carer as a child. She admits she was very emotionally distressed at the time.' Wildish added that 
the charges against her have been very hard on both Skubala and her partner, who lives in Doncaster. Her sole 
intention of flying to Bristol was to try and get a job in Avonmouth. And with Skubala temporarily not allowed to 
work, the couple could barely afford to come to Bristol for court hearings. 'Ordinarily she drinks cider,' Wildish 
explained before the court. 'By drinking the vodka her partner had purchased, she wasn't used to its strength [and] 
became drunk very quickly. Ever since she's been in the UK she's worked but since the offence she hasn't been 
able to work because the police have her passport." Skubala's lawyer, Rupert Russell, echoed Wildish's 
sentiments. 'She had not intended to cause danger or alarm on the flight. She was simply too drunk to listen to 
instructions or recognize the danger she was causing,' he said. This representational image shows a 'low-cost' 
airline Ryanair plane flying over Nantes, western France, Sept. 15, 2005. Photo: Frank Perry/AFP/Getty Images 
Before passing the judgment, the presiding judge condemned Skubala's behavior and explained why she was not 
being sentenced to prison. 'You were extremely drunk, you were causing a disturbance with people around you and 
smoking. There were three further persistent occasions when you tried to smoke on the plane ignoring instructions

that you must not. And you were abusive and intimidating and I have no doubt people were fearful of your behavior,' 
the judge said. 'You are someone with no previous convictions, you present a very low risk of ever re-offending and 
you have been severely affected by these proceedings because you've been unable to work without having your 
passport. You have gone to big efforts to make sure you are at court on time for each of the hearings there have 
been 
and 
you've 
shown 
genuine 
and 
deep 
remorse,' 
the 
judge 
added.

Profits soar as British Airways owner flies high

BRITISH Airways owner International Airlines Group (IAG) said yesterday profit soared 9.5 per cent last year.
Shares lifted two per cent as the group reported that pre-tax profit for the year to the end of December was 
(EURO)3.2bn, up from (EURO)2.95bn in 2017. They closed 0.2pc lower.
Revenue was up 6.7 per cent from (EURO)22.8bn in 2017 to (EURO)24.4bn last year despite challenges such as 
increasing fuel prices, air traffic control disruption and foreign exchange costs. Passenger revenue rose 6.2 per cent 
across the group.
However, the business warned that in 2019 it would be hit by fuel prices and exchange ratings and that profit this 
year would be flat. The company proposed a special dividend of (EURO)700m and an ordinary dividend of 
(EURO)615m.
IAG has managed to weather the problems facing many airlines currently, which saw budget carriers Wizz Air and 
Ryanair slash profits earlier this year.
In a separate statement, IAG said it planned to order 18 Boeing 777-9s and had options for 24 more for British 
Airways.
Chief executive Willie Walsh said: "In 2018, we're reporting an operating profit of (EURO)3.2bn before exceptional 
items, up 9.5 per cent compared to last year. Yet again, we've improved our operating profit this year and our 
adjusted earnings per share grew by 15.1 per cent.
Profits soar as British Airways owner flies high
"This was a very good performance despite three significant challenges: fuel prices increasing 30 per cent, 
considerable air traffic control disruption and an adverse foreign exchange impact of (EURO)129m," he said.

Ryanair plans share reclassification after hard Brexit

If Britain leaves the European Union (EU) without a deal, non-EU shareholders of Ryanair will lose their voting and 
attendance rights at general meetings of the low-cost carrier, its board has resolved.
Accordingly, in the event of no-deal, all ordinary and depository shares held by such parties will be reclassified as 
restricted shares in order for the company to satisfy the EU's ownership and control requirements.
Non-EU investors, including those from the UK, will also not be permitted to acquire Ryanair ordinary shares after a 
no-deal Brexit.
Roughly 55% of Ryanair stock is EU-owned, while British shareholders control about 20%.
"These resolutions will remain in place until the Board determines that the ownership and control of the Company is 
no longer such that there is any risk to the airline licences held by the Company's subsidiaries pursuant to EU 
Regulation 1008/2008," stated Ryanair.

Two pilots in the cockpit and passengers feel safe. Two state investors in the holding company and shareholders 
feel queasy. The Dutch government's lunge for the joystick at Air France-KLM knocked a tenth of the value off its 
newly acquired 13 per cent yesterday. Brace for more frights.
Economic nationalism is on the rise across Europe. Assertive politicians promoting national - or continental - 
champions could boost the share prices of some companies. But Dutch stakebuilding in Air France-KLM is 
defensive, aimed at protecting the Netherlands' interests.
Conceivably, Dutch politicians will protect other shareholders from unhelpful interventions by Paris. More likely, 
corporate strategy discussions will descend into spats over the merits of Schiphol airport versus Charles de Gaulle 
airport. Worse, there could be a three-way tussle for control. Strategic partners Delta Air and China Eastern each 
have 9 per cent stakes - and a shared interest in boosting transcontinental volumes, not jobs at European hubs.
Air France-KLM badly needs to avoid distractions. It was formed in 2004 when EU expansion and economic 
integration were in the air. But chief executive Benjamin Smith, who took the controls in September last year, faces 
a host of legacy issues, including dire labour relations. In a 2015 dispute, an Air France manager was forced to flee 
half-naked over a fence to escape angry workers outside its Charles de Gaulle headquarters.
Mr Smith's predecessor quit last May after losing a staff vote on a pay offer already rejected by Air France unions.
So far Mr Smith has kept his shirt.
Air France - KLM : Airplane 2 Twitter : @FTLex
But Air France-KLM's operating margins at 5 per cent last year compared with 10 per cent at Germany's Lufthansa 
and 14 per cent at IAG, which owns British Airways and Spain's Iberia. Dutch disgruntlement is justified: operating 
margins were just 1.7 per cent at Air France, but almost 10 per cent at KLM.
Air France-KLM's shares had risen by a quarter in a week as the Dutch government built its stake, before 
nosediving once it was revealed. That left its enterprise value at 4 times forward ebitdar, a cash earnings measure 
that adjusts for differences in leasing costs. Lufthansa is on 4.4 and Ryanair on almost 8, Bernstein says.
Too many hands yanking on the controls, and it will stall further.

No-deal Brexit could result in five-hour queues at Spanish airports
No-deal Brexit could result in five-hour queues at Spanish airports

Highlight: British consumer group Which? has warned that British tourists may have to wait for five hours or more 
in queues at Spanish airports in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Body
The airports in Alicante, Tenerife, Lanzarote, and Malaga are likely to be most affected by extra border checks if the 
UK leaves the European Union without a deal.Which? claimed that Alicante Airport in southern Spain will require 
the resources to manage an additional 201 hours of immigration checks on British passport holders per 
day.According to estimates by the European Tourism Association, these checks will add 90 seconds for each UK 
passport holder.This means it would take a single passport lane nearly five hours to process 189 travellers on a 
single Ryanair flight, if all of the passengers were UK passport holders.Alicante Airport is expected to face serious 
problems as 43% of its arrivals are from the UK. 
Nearly 2.9 million British passengers travel through the airport each year.The Government of Spain has not 
announced its plan to deal with the additional immigration requirements.However, Portugal is planning to open 
special lanes at Faro Airport in the Algarve and Funchal, the capital of Madeira, to provide fast-track access for 
British passport holders.Which? travel editor Rory Boland was quoted by The Guardian as saying: “Airports can be 
chaotic at the best of times but if additional checks at passport control are implemented in the event of a no-deal, it 
seems that very long queues are going to be an unwanted side effect.“Until there is a deal or these airports 
announce simpler arrangements, you should consider what you may need if you have to fly to them, as it is very 
likely that you’ll be in a queue for several hours. Make sure you have food, water, and essentials for kids like 
nappies to hand,” Boland added.

Flybmi collapse signals wider difficulties in the regional airline industry
Flybmi collapse signals wider difficulties in the regional airline industry

Highlight: Flybmi, the East Midlands airline, went into administration on 16 February after hitting financial troubles 
and, in a sign of the difficulties ahead, only smaller airlines have shown an interest in picking up the routes left 
behind.
Body
Flybmi posted a loss of Â£4.1 million in 2017. Accounts for the year ending 2018 were not filed. The airline 
operated 29,000 flights last year with 522,000 passengers but was unable to reverse a lengthy series of financial 
losses.A Flybmi spokesperson said that despite investment around Â£40 million in the company in the last six 
years, it was with a "heavy heart" that the airline would cancel its flights and go into administration.As competition 
becomes fiercer within the industry, Flybmi is just the latest example of an airline in trouble. Many others have faced 
administration in the past decade and the future is uncertain for those airlines still operating.Primera Air, Monarch, 
Cobalt Air and Air Berlin are just a few examples of airline companies to have entered administration in recent 
times.Brexit uncertainty, rising fuel prices and carbon costs have been highlighted as the causes behind the crash 
of Flybmi.Smaller airlines are assisting as big names keep awayHaving had the opportunity to adopt the routes 
used by Flybmi, only the smaller regional airlines have stepped in to do so, which suggests the larger airlines are 
cautious about taking on any additional commitments.Easy Jet declared that they are continuously looking at 
growth opportunities but are uninterested in Flybmi. 
To date, no major airlines have become involved.Although small regional airlines can struggle to compete against 
the big players, in localised areas these carriers can prosper.Loganair, a Scottish regional airline has responded by 
picking up the pieces, claiming five key routes that were originally operated by Flybmi. These involve flights from 
Aberdeen to Bristol, Oslo and Esbjerg (Denmark), as well as flights from Newcastle airport to Stavanger (Norway) 
and Bruges (Belgium). Another regional airline that has co-operated is Danish Air Transport (DAT) claiming the 
routes from Esbjerg to Aberdeen.That the likes of Loganair have moved in, and big carriers have not, reveals the 
strain under which the likes of EasyJet are under at present.Harsh realities of the airline industry suggest troubles 
will continueThe underlying problems the industry is facing involve rising jet fuel prices, fierce competition amongst 
other airlines and the associated risks that come with each decision.As an example, since February 2018 jet fuel 
prices have increased by 5.1%, according to the International Air Transport Association.Flybe struggled last year, 
Flybmi collapse signals wider difficulties in the regional airline industry
however, the company was saved by a combination of support from Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyprus 
Capital partners in a group named Connect Airways.Most recently, Thomas Cook has considered a strategic 
analysis of their airline due to a loss of sales during 2018 at Â£163 million.Ryanair is also struggling. The Ireland-
based company issued a profit warning in January after winter fares were lower than previously thought, producing 
around Â£122 million less than expected.

An urgent call to optimise European airspace

Highlight: It was the nightmare scenario that many airlines had seen coming but few policymakers in Europe were 
willing to do anything to avoid. During the busiest month of last year's summer period, the number of en-route 
delays facing EU passengers increased by a staggering 150% on the year before.
Body
In total, passengers experienced 10.6 million minutes of delays during June, July and August 2018 – the equivalent 
of over 20 years collectively, according to Airlines for Europe (A4E), a trade association that represents 15 leading 
airline groups.“This past summer was the worst in nearly a decade,” says Jennifer Janzen, A4E communications 
director. “And the prognosis for the next, upcoming summer is even worse.”Sovereignty strugglesThe delays 
underscored the huge challenge now facing Europe’s aviation sector: that while air traffic is increasing (up 4% last 
summer) as it becomes cheaper and easier to fly than ever before, the continent’s air traffic management system 
can no longer accommodate the demand.The key factor explaining this inefficiency, according to A4E, is different 
countries wanting to maintain sovereignty. Unlike the US, where a single airspace is managed by a single provider, 
in Europe there are around 30 different air traffic control centres, with each country managing its own airspace.For 
years the European Commission promised to implement a ‘Single European Sky’ designed to manage and regulate 
airspace in a more efficient manner, but with member states following their own political agendas, the proposals 
lacked support and never truly materialised.“The sovereignty issue has played a leading role in the fact that the 
Single European Sky has not been able to happen,” says Janzen. 
“Countries do not want to give up their sovereignty. They don’t want to allow their airspace to be controlled by 
anybody other than themselves.”Strikes and staff shortagesA shortage of air traffic controllers and regular strikes 
are also contributing to the problem, airlines say. Last year Ryanair took to Twitter, claiming “French, German, 
Spanish and UK ATC staff shortages caused delays to over 1,000 flights”. The UK’s national air traffic control 
provider, NATS, rejected the criticism.Since 2005 the European Union (EU) has experienced 357 air traffic control 
strikes, according to data from the European Commission. Between 2010 and 2017 the economic impact of these 
strikes stood at a staggering &euro;13.4bn, a study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers found.“We simply do not have 
enough ATC staff,” argues Janzen. “Controllers take several years to be trained and having one ATC centre trained 
to take over controlling flights from a different centre from a bordering country can take months. You also have a lot 
An urgent call to optimise European airspace
of issues with regards to holidays. Everybody likes to take their holidays in Europe in the summer, which for airlines 
is of course peak season.”To avoid a repeat of last summer’s misery, the chief operating officers of Europe’s 
leading airlines got together last November with partner associations and Eurocontrol in Brussels to call on the EU 
to tackle the problems affecting the continent’s air space. The message they put forward was clear, says 
Janzen.“We agreed that now is the time to act,” she says. “We cannot afford to have a repeat of last summer.”A 
three-tiered solutionAs part of a three-tiered strategy, A4E has put forward a number of short-term measures 
designed to get the situation under control for passengers. It wants as many people as possible to sign an ‘Efficient 
Airspace’ declaration agreed last November and ensure that Europe’s air traffic management (ATM) system 
remains a top political priority both at a national and EU level. Airlines are already doing their bit by employing 
additional staff to work in their operation control centres to try and manage the situation better.“We need a fresh, 
collaborative approach where everyone commits to working collaboratively, putting their differences aside and 
delivering,” says Janzen.In the medium stage, from 2019-25, A4E is advocating for new Single European Sky ATM 
Research (SESAR) technologies to be introduced to help reduce air traffic controller workloads, improve 
productivity and safely increase capacity. More significantly, it wants to integrate national airspace into a single 
continuum it calls the “Seamless European Sky”.“The Single European Sky is a term that is not very highly 
regarded here in Brussels because it just never happened,” Janzen explains. “We thought that in order to inject 
some enthusiasm and motivation we should give it a new name and call it what it really is: a seamless sky. It is a 
section of airspace which essentially crosses national boundaries, a single continuum that still allows the countries 
to safeguard their national sovereignty.”In the long term, from 2035 onwards, A4E’s plan involves future-proofing 
Europe’s air traffic management system by calling for “collaborative and network-focused planning processes” that 
create the most efficient daily operations, while also ensuring digitalisation and automation are on par with other 
industries, and flight trajectories are based on sustainable routes that get from A to B with the lowest emissions 
possible.Put together, these plans might sound ambitious, but for Janzen a critical mass is already being built 
among consumers, cargo shippers and airline operators affected by the constant delays. In Brussels, she says the 
tone among EU officials is now shifting, with politicians increasingly aware of the issue and the need to finally take

Low cost airlines Ryanair and Wizz Air were fined by Italy's antitrust regulator on Thursday for their hand-luggage 
restrictions.
The Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) said extra charges for larger carry-on bags, which the two airlines 
introduced last year, represented an unfair trade practice.
Being able to take on board a reasonably sized bag as part of the standard air fare is an "essential service" that 
should not be subject to additional fees, AGCM said.
It fined Ryanair 3 million euros (3.4 million dollars) and Wizz Air 1 million euros. Both companies were given 60 
days to change their luggage policy.

Retail investors at risk in hard Brexit dual-listing tussle, asset managers warn Equities

Brussels' plan to restrict trading in shares listed both in London and elsewhere in the EU in the event of a hard 
Brexit will deliver a major blow to retail investors, asset management groups have warned.
Ryanair, British Airways owner IAG and Unilever are among the companies that will be hit by the stipulation from 
Brussels that EU-based investors can only trade shares on exchanges it recognises.
It is a status that EU authorities do not plan to extend to London venues if Britain leaves the trading bloc abruptly at 
the end of next month.
That will force EU-based asset managers to buy and sell the shares of the affected companies at typically less 
liquid and competitive exchanges outside London.
Retail investors have almost (EURO)40bn tied up in companies with dual-listed shares, according to an analysis of 
Ucits funds from the German Investment Funds Association, or BVI.
The fate of dual-listed shares is the latest point of contention that a hard Brexit has thrown up for Europe's capital 
markets.
Despite fierce lobbying from asset management groups, EU authorities argue that its contingency planning for a no-
deal Brexit should focus on ensuring financial stability.
Retail investors at risk in hard Brexit dual-listing tussle, asset managers warn Equities
Authorities are also keen to ensure that any stop-gap measures do not give Britain access to the bloc's single 
market through the backdoor.
However, with just over a month until the UK is set to exit the EU, investor groups are stepping up efforts to prompt 
a change in Brussels.
"Safeguarding access to this infrastructure is critical to all asset managers so they can continue to operate 
effectively and efficiently across European capital markets," said Chris Cummings, chief executive of the IA, a UK 
trade association.
The stand-off has led to speculation that, in the event of a hard Brexit, companies will ditch their listing elsewhere in 
the EU and keep the one in London.
Even if Britain leaves the EU on March 29 this year without a deal, EU-based investors would still be able to buy 
and sell shares of companies only listed in London.
Coca-Cola European Partners, the world's largest independent bottler of the eponymous drink, is one company 
planning to have listings in both London and the rest of the EU.
It wants to transfer its existing London listing to the LSE on March 28, the day before the UK is due to leave the EU, 
but it will keep listings in the US, Netherlands and Spain.
"It will make it easier for European investors to trade in [our] shares," the company said.
Estimates vary on many companies could be ensnared by the dual listing question.
Some put it at about 500 companies, although some estimates are much lower if regulators apply a threshold for 
only the most actively traded shares.
The BVI, which used data from Morningstar, said its estimates on the amount of retail money potentially caught up 
were conservative.
The estimates did not include regulated institutional funds, institutional managed portfolios or direct investments by 
pension funds or insurance companies.

UK regional airline flybmi has gone into administration, blaming "insurmountable" challenges caused by Brexit and 
dealing another blow to the UK's aviation sector.
All flybmi flights have been cancelled. British Midland Regional, which operated as flybmi, blamed factors including 
a spike in fuel and carbon prices, but added: "Current trading and future prospects have also been seriously 
affected by the uncertainty created by the Brexit process, which has led to our inability to secure valuable flying 
contracts in Europe and lack of confidence around bmi's ability to continue flying between destinations in 
Europe."UK aviation has now experienced the collapse of two airlines - flybmi and Cello Aviation - in the past five 
months and the 1p-a-share sale of troubled carrier Flybe (unrelated to flybmi). Flybe was on the verge of 
bankruptcy in January as talks to save its sale to a consortium including Virgin Atlantic faltered.
Andy McDonald, the Labour MP and shadow transport secretary, said: "The airline has been in difficulty for some 
time and I hope the Department for Transport has contingency measures in place for the key regional routes served 
by the airline and consider how best to support these going forward."
Airlines have been citing Brexit as a factor in recent bad news. Ryanair's chief marketing officer said "a Brexit 
backdrop" would be responsible for slower growth in the UK than the EU in the next financial year.
Flybmi blames Brexit for bankruptcy Airlines ; Challenges surrounding EU vote and fuel prices led to collapse, 
says carrier
A "bare-bones" air connectivity deal, to ensure flights continue even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, has removed 
the most immediate risk for UK airlines, but questions over ownership, flying rights and a proposed flight cap have 
persisted.
There have been wider problems besetting the European aviation sector, which has seen a slew of collapses in the 
past two years. Earlier in February, Berlin-based Germania ceased operations, following Latvia-based Primera Air, 
Cobalt Air of Cyprus, Germany's Azur Air, Lithuania's Small Planet Airlines and the Swiss SkyWork last autumn.
High fuel prices and overcapacity, which drives down fares, have been principal causes and have led to a wave of 
consolidation.
Flybmi, which carried 520,000 passengers in 2018, said the airline's owners had put more than £40m into the 
business in the past six years. The airline made a loss of £4m in the year to the end of March 2017, the most recent 
for which accounts are available. It employed 376 people in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Belgium and mainly 
served northern European destinations.
The airline had been a regional subsidiary of British Midland International, which IAG - owner of British Airways - 
bought from Lufthansa in 2012. IAG sold flybmi to Sector Aviation Holdings later the same year, which was itself 
sold to Airline Investments Limited in 2015.

Ryanair has swooped to encourage flight personnel from collapsed BMI Regional to join the budget carrier.
The airline had already started offering rescue fares to stranded passengers on certain European routes within a 
couple of hours of BMI Regional’s cessation of services on 16 February.
But Ryanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew is seeking to recruit affected flight crew and other specialist 
personnel from the carrier.
“We have availability of jobs in the UK and throughout our network for pilots and engineers,” he says, adding that 
the airline would be “delighted to welcome” applications.
“We have vacancies for the summer and we are able to get assessments done quite quickly next week.”
Ryanair operates a fleet of Boeing 737-800s while BMI Regional’s operation was based on the Embraer ERJ.

Brussels brands BA owner's Brexit plan 'totally absurd'
Brussels brands BA owner's Brexit plan 'totally absurd'

The announcement by IAG, the owner of British Airways, that it would consider UK shareholders as EU investors 
after Brexit has been described as "totally absurd" by a senior official in Brussels.
The Spanish airline group said this week that it had put a cap on the number of non-EU investors who can own 
shares in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But it also suggested that it would count UK shareholders as EU investors 
even in that scenario.
Airlines must show they are more than 50 per cent owned and controlled by EU investors to retain flying rights 
within the bloc, posing a challenge for some European carriers, such as IAG, Ryanair and easyJet, with their 
diverse investor bases.
IAG said UK investors "are not and will not be subject to the restrictions on share acquisitions ... unless IAG notifies 
shareholders otherwise. IAG has no plans to issue such a notification".
The EU official said IAG had not approached the European Commission to discuss its move, which appeared 
directed at maintaining its flying rights in case of several potential Brexit outcomes.
Once the UK leaves the EU, a company's UK investors will not count towards the target, meaning a company which 
was previously European will no longer be. EasyJet recently announced it had reached 49 per cent EU ownership.
Brussels brands BA owner's Brexit plan 'totally absurd'
IAG, Ryanair and easyJet all have corporate provisions to strip voting rights from non-EU shareholders and to force 
them to sell their shares so they can meet the target, and IAG reiterated on Monday night that it would do so.
The group, which also owns Spain's Iberia, said it had fixed the maximum level of share ownership by non-EU 
persons at 47.5 per cent, its current level. Any non-EU investor who tries to buy IAG shares will have the shares' 
voting rights removed and will be required to sell them within 10 days.
The company added: "There can be no assurance as to when, or if, the permitted maximum will be removed."
Brussels has proposed giving airline groups such as IAG a seven-month deadline to overhaul their shareholder 
make-up in order to retain full flying rights within the EU if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal . A lawyer, 
who did not wish to be named, said that IAG's statement about not treating UK investors as non-EU entities after 
Brexit "makes no sense".
IAG has been reticent on the subject of Brexit. The group's chairman, Antonio Vázquez Romero, has said it has 
"contingency plans" but did not provide further details.

Easyjet Confirms Talks With Italy 's State Railway, Delta Air Lines to Bailout Alitalia
Easyjet Confirms Talks With Italy's State Railway, Delta Air Lines to Bailout 
Alitalia

 British budget airline easyJet plc (EZJ.L) confirmed on Wednesday that it is in discussions with the Italian state 
railway and US-based Delta Air Lines (DAL) about forming a consortium to rescue Italy's flag carrier Alitalia.
This follows submission of easyJet's interest in a restructured Alitalia in October, according to a statement. 
The consortium, which includes Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, will "explore options for the future operations of 
Alitalia," the statement noted. "There is no certainty at this stage that any transaction will proceed and easyJet will 
provide a further update in due course, if and when appropriate."
While talks continue to secure the future of Alitalia, the mood on the ground at Uiltrasporti, a transport workers' 
trade union, is somewhat different.
"In the meetings of October 12 and December 12, we have been repeatedly assured that there would be no 
redundancies," according to a statement from the union on Tuesday. "We, therefore, ask [Luigi] Di Maio [Italy's 
deputy premier and economy minister] to deny such news, and in view of the next meeting on 14 February, we 
expect it to be finally constructive."
Trade unions reportedly voted against Alitalia's restructuring before it fell into administration in 2017 for the second 
time in a decade in which the airline is said to have received 7 billion euros ($7.91 billion) in State support. At the 
time, shareholder Etihad and other Italian investors would have invested 2 billion euros in a rescue program.
Since 2017, the Italian government has been looking for a suitor while rival budget carriers such as Ireland's 
Ryanair (RYAAY) and Easyjet have gained ground in a highly competitive industry.

 easyJet PLC on Thursday confirmed it is in talks with Italy's Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Spa and the US's Delta Air 
Lines Inc in order to form a consortium to explore options regarding the future of beleaguered Italian airline Alitalia 
Societa Aerea Italiana Spa. 
Ferrovie dello Stato is a state-owned company that manages the Italian rail network, while Delta is an Atlanta, 
Georgia-based airline.  
At the end of October, easyJet submitted a proposal expressing interest in Alitalia after the Italian government was 
forced to rescue the Italian flag carrier in 2017.
Alitalia went into government-controlled administration in 2017 and was kept afloat by Italian state loans worth 
EUR900 million. The Italian government was supposed to recoup the money by December 15, 2018 and wrap up 
bankruptcy procedures; however it decided to extend the loan to June 30, 2019.
Back in June 2018, both easyJet and fellow budget operator Ryanair Holdings PLC expresses interest in acquiring 
Alitalia, with the latter backing out following chaos caused by strikes and flights cancellations.
easyJet already flies to many destinations in Italy, including Rome, Milan and Naples. 
easyJet shares were trading up 0.4% at 1,287.10 pence each.

Ryanair does not expect strike action this summer as relations with unions have improved significantly in the past 
three months, although it cannot be ruled out entirely, the Irish low-cost carrier's marketing chief said on Thursday.
"We don't see a horizon of unrest," Chief Marketing Officer Kenny Jacobs told journalists at a press conference in 
London. "We don't see a risk of strikes in the summer. That doesn't mean there won't be."
Asked if he still expected agreements to be reached with all of Ryanair's major unions by the end of March, Jacobs 
said: "Yes, that's fair to say." (Reuters)

Ryanair's unions have criticised Michael O'Leary, the low-cost airline group's chief executive, after the company 
announced he could receive a bonus of up to (EURO)99m.
Joost van Doesburg of the Dutch pilots' union VNV said: "This type of bonus will only stimulate Mr O'Leary to 
continue his unsustainable way of dealing with his employees and increase social abuse like bogus self-
employment and no sick pay.
"It would be much better if the social welfare of the Ryanair staff would be taken into account when the senior 
management are getting their bonuses."
Brian Strutton, general secretary of Balpa, the British pilots' union, said: "If [Mr O'Leary] deserves a whopping great 
bonus like this, then pilots deserve the equivalent because they meet their targets day in and day out."
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment.
The UK-listed, Irish-based airline issued options for 10m shares to Mr O'Leary on Friday at a strike price of 
(EURO)11.12, which he can buy should he increase the company's profitability to (EURO)2bn and/or its share price 
to (EURO)21 over the next five years. The difference between 10m shares at (EURO)21 each and the same 
number at (EURO)11.12, their closing price on Friday, is (EURO)99m.
Ryanair boss attacked over (EURO)99m bonus plan Airlines
Ryanair's share price hit a peak of nearly (EURO)20 in August 2017, but since then has slid as oil prices have risen 
and industrial action escalated.
If Mr O'Leary increases Ryanair's profitability to (EURO)2bn but the shares do not hit (EURO)21, his bonus will be 
smaller.
Last week Ryanair reaffirmed its warning that full-year profit would be in the range of (EURO)1bn-(EURO)1.1bn. 
The range had been (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn before two profit warnings in the past four months.
Royal London Asset Management, a Ryanair shareholder, called the potential award "wholly inappropriate". "Asking 
shareholders to pay directors more than (EURO)100m for achieving a marginal improvement over its share price 
high in August 2017 is ludicrous," the investment group said.
Ryanair has been engaged in negotiations with its unions since agreeing to recognise them in late 2017 after a 
rostering failure and staff shortage led to thousands of flight cancellations. Additional reporting by Owen Walker

The strike began at 10pm on Tuesday evening and will continue to 10pm today.Belgian air navigation service

start of the national strike, the company does not have sufficient insight into the staffing levels during the industrial 
action that will start tonight."Air traffic controllers have called the strike in protest of stalled negotiations between 
national trade unions and the government pertaining to a two-year pay increase for all workers in the 
country.Skeyes' employees do not have to declare their intentions to work or not during trade union actions in 
advance.Media reports suggest nearly 500Â flights to and from Brussels Airport haveÂ been cancelled, while

kindly ask our passengers not to come to the airport on Wednesday."Passengers whose flight is affected by the 
general strike are requested to contact their airline," the statement added.Government, military, and emergency 
flights are not affected by the strike.Ryanair local hub Charleroi Airport has cancelled around 600 outbound flights

Laudamotion will double the number of Airbus A320s it has based at Majorca from two to four this summer as 
competitors reduce their presence on the Spanish island.
The Ryanair subsidiary says the additional two aircraft at Palma de Mallorca will allow the opening of "numerous 
new" routes – these are not specified – and increased frequencies from Germany and Austria to the Balearic Island.
Laudamotion says it is reacting "directly and extremely quickly to the changed market situation and the increased 
demand".
The Austrian carrier is inviting Germania and Norwegian cabin crew based on the Spanish island to join its growing 
operations at Palma.
Norwegian disclosed in January that it plans to close its crew base at Palma later this year. The Scandinavian 
carrier signalled a "minor reduction" in weekly frequencies to Copenhagen, Dusseldorf, Helsinki and Oslo from the 
Balearic island.
Germania, which opened a base at Palma in 2017, filed for insolvency earlier this month.
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that Ryanair is the largest operator at Palma, with an near-20% share of seat 
capacity. Vueling is second with 19.5%, and Air Europa third with 14.4%. Laudamotion currently accounts for 3% of 
the available seats.

Feb 11, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  A Ryanair 
passenger broke his ankle when he attempted to protect his child during a sudden change in the altitudeof the 
plane. The pilot of the flight made the drastic maneuver in order to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft in 
the vicinity. The incident took place Sunday when Ryanair Flight 737 was flying on autopilot at the altitude of 37,000 
feet over Canary Islands, Spain, at 4:38 p.m. local time (11:38 a.m. EST). Although the plane initially did not face 
any objection from the air traffic control room when the pilot requested to descend to 13,000 feet, the air crew was 
told to stop their descent after dropping just 1,000 feet from their previous altitude. 
The reason behind the sudden change in instruction was an EasyJet flight that was flying at 35,000 feet near the 
area. "Seconds later, at 16:38:07, according to flight recorder data, the aircraft's pilot selected the ALT HOLD mode 
on the mode control panel (MCP) in order to maintain the altitude. At that time the aircraft was passing through 
FL364 at a high rate of descent,' an incident report said, Mirror Online[1] reported. 'One second later, as the aircraft 
was crossing through FL363, the pilot decided to disengage the autopilot.' When the pilot was questioned as part of 
the investigation, he said the recovery maneuver was taking more time than expected on autopilot and since he 
thought 'they had gone past their cleared flight level of FL360,' he decided to take things into his own hands and 
stop the descent manually. A Ryanair passenger broke his ankle when the plane suddenly changed direction to 
avoid potential collision with another aircraft in the vicinity. In this photo, a Ryanair plane departs from Stansted 
Airport in London, Oct. 20, 2016. Photo: Getty Images/ Dan Kitwood 'The investigation has determined that the 
accident probably occurred when the crew executed a sudden manual maneuver to maintain the specified flight 
level,' the report added. 'A contributing factor is the fact that the autopilot was disengaged in order to carry out the 
manual maneuver, which contributed to its abrupt nature." Due to the sudden change in direction without any 
warning, the aircraft lurched, causing flight attendants as well as passengers who were standing in the cabin to 
tumble to the ground. This included the passenger who broke his ankle. "The injured passenger had a child, 
approximately five years old, in his arms and that he was exiting the right hand lavatory. These sudden movements 
caused all four flight attendants to fall to the floor. The injured passenger turned his body to the left to try to shield 
the child, which forced his legs into an unnatural position. He broke his ankle when he fell due to the jolts,' an 
unidentified flight attendant who was present on the flight, said. 'The child hit the back of his head, which caused 
some bruising. No one else was injured. After the event, the injured passengers cried out in pain. Their relatives 
were also upset and raised their voices at the flight attendants, complaining about what had happened,' the 
attendant added. [ 1]: https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/ryanair-passenger-breaks-ankle-plane-13981257

Danish line-maintenance specialist Northern Aerotech has come up with an unusual plan to grow its business – by 
putting it in a box.
Setting up a line maintenance station and securing regulatory approvals is a complicated process, the company's 
founder and chief executive Morten Schalls Jorgensen tells FlightGlobal.
A qualified aircraft engineer, Jorgensen was previously employed by a line maintenance provider and was 
frequently seconded to set up line-support operations.
Having decided that "something was missing" in the market, he set up his own Copenhagen-based company in 
2011. Using a fleet of vans equipped with the required tooling and material, he had the capability to establish initial 
line-maintenance operations away from base.
European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations have made it possible to create such operations throughout 
the EU based on the company's Danish Part 145 maintenance-provider certification, he notes.
The "deployable stations" have worked well, he says, particularly for airlines that are opening new routes and want 
to assess their viability for a limited time without the initial expense of installing permanent facilities.
But as the van-based operations are confined to airports within driving distance of the home base, the concept is 
limited. Northern Aerotech has therefore developed a miniaturised version in a box, which fits on a standard freight 
pallet for deployment further afield.
Jorgensen says his team is able to able to set up line operations "within days", while larger MRO providers might 
take months to establish far-flung line maintenance stations.
ANALYSIS: Mobility key to line maintenance at Northern Aerotech Danish line-maintenance specialist Northern 
Aerotech has come up with an unusual plan to grow it....
Northern Aerotech's "flexibility and speed" helps it differentiate itself from the rest of the field, Jorgensen asserts.
At peak periods, the company employs around 80 engineers and has permanent stations throughout Europe, in 
addition to a fleet of maintenance vans and boxes. The business generated revenue of around 6 million ($6.8 
million) in 2018.
Ryanair and the Latvian charter and wet-lease operator SmartLynx are among the MRO provider's customers.
More recently, the company has established line operations in Vietnam's capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, in co-
operation with local Qantas joint venture Jetstar Pacific.
Jorgensen says Northern Aerotech's main customers are low-cost carriers and ACMI operators, which have a 
particular need for flexibility as they often establish operations on an ad-hoc basis when other airlines require 
additional short-term capacity.
He is not worried that efforts by Airbus and Boeing to grow their aftermarket activities will have an adverse effect on 
Northern Aerotech's business.
Jorgensen says the manufacturers' efforts tend to concentrate on airlines that are or will be operating fleets of new 
aircraft, while much of Northern Aerotech’s business is about servicing mature equipment of a "certain age".
He does say, however, that airlines' behaviour when buying line maintenance services has changed, creating a 
tougher trading environment.
Describing local line support as "insurance" against flight disruptions caused by technical incidents, he says airlines 
"take more risks" as aircraft have become more reliable.
The buying of line maintenance services is directly related to an airline's economic circumstances, he points out. As 
a result, it has become "more difficult" to grow the business.
But he sees a bigger challenge in a projected shortage of aircraft technicians caused by retirements amid rising 
traffic. Jorgensen says that the inability to recruit enough engineers is an obstacle to growth.
Rather than individual efforts by airlines, MRO providers and manufacturers to train their own staff, the issue 
requires "political focus" to encourage more co-operation between aftermarket players, Jorgensen argues..
But "nobody is doing anything about it", he complains. "Everybody is just trying to secure their own operations."

? Credit Suisse has frozen its 2018 bonus pool while awarding top executives double-digit pay rises ahead of an 
expected rise in higher annual pre-tax profits.
The Swiss bank's overall pool of bonuses will remain flat at about SFr3.2bn ($3.2bn) in the latest pay round as the 
board seeks to balance distributions to shareholders with pay for staff, according to people with knowledge of the 
decision.
But top executives led by chief executive Tidjane Thiam, right, are set to receive a pay boost after removing a 
voluntary pay cap imposed in the past two years.
The move comes despite an almost 30 per cent fall in the bank's share price in the past year.
? Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond stepped down as chairman of Atlas Mara as the pan-African 
banking group he founded said it was reviewing the future of its operations.
Mr Diamond will remain a non-executive director at the group, which he floated in 2013 with plans to create an 
African banking giant. The vehicle has since suffered an 85 per cent share price collapse.
? Facebook will ban graphic images of self-harm on its photo-sharing platform Instagram, after UK legislators 
threatened to introduce new laws if social media groups did not step up efforts to protect users from harmful 
content.

and suicide prevention www.experts.UK policymakers have piled pressure on social media platforms this year after 
Ian Russell, whose 14-year-old daughter Molly took her own life in 2017, partly blamed the companies for her 
death.
? UniCredit said net profits more than doubled in the fourth quarter, boosted by a tax gain, as the Italian bank 
reported its best underlying performance for a decade and rebounded from litigation provisions and business 
writedowns.
Italy's largest bank by assets said net operating profit for last year was 13 per cent higher than the previous year at 
(EURO)6.4bn, the highest level since 2008.
The Milan-based lender is in the final year of a turnround plan designed to shrink bad loans and cut costs. Chief 
executive Jean-Pierre Mustier, who launched the plan when he took over in 2016, said it was "well ahead of

chief executive of the airline itself as the lowcost carrier overhauls its structure. Chairman David Bonderman is to

Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary will gain a bonus of up to (EURO)100m if he hits performance targets.
The UK-listed and Irish based company issued options for 10m shares to Mr O'Leary at a strike price of 
(EURO)11.12, which he can buy should he increase the company's profitability to (EURO)2bn and/or its share price 
to (EURO)21 over the next five years.
The difference between 10m shares at (EURO)21 each and the same number at (EURO)11.12, their closing price 
yesterday, is (EURO)99m.
If Mr O'Leary increases profitability but the share price does not hit (EURO)21, his bonus would be smaller.

about 1 per cent of Ryanair stock, said: "I would have thought he would be a bit sheepish accepting that, given the 
current state of the company. But I don't think pay matters much to him - it's more about power."
Ryanair's 11 non-executive directors have received options of 50,000 shares each under the same terms, meaning 
their bonus could be as much as (EURO)500,000.
Ryanair, which announced a thirdquarter loss of (EURO)22m on Monday, reaffirmed its warning that full-year profit 
would be in the range of (EURO)1.0bn-(EURO)1.1bn.

The range had been (EURO)1.25bn-(EURO)1.35bn before two profit warnings in the past four months, but Mr 
O'Leary said a fall in ticket prices, as well as the cost of staff strikes and the high price of oil, had hurt the airline.
Royal London Asset Management, another large Ryanair shareholder, has said it does not consider the 
remuneration committee to be "wholly independent", since it includes a former executive, "which is contrary to best 
practice".
On the day of the results, Mr O'Leary announced he would remain at the top of Ryanair for another five years, but 
would step down as chief executive of the airline itself as the company overhauled its structure.
The airline said it would move in the next year "to a group structure not dissimilar to that of IAG", owner of British 
Airways and Iberia, with a small senior management team overseeing Ryanair, Laudamotion, based in Austria, 
Ryanair Sun, in Poland, and Ryanair UK.
Mr O'Leary will be chief executive of Ryanair Holdings until at least 2024 and the Ryanair airline itself will appoint a 
new chief executive later this year.
In his new role, Mr O'Leary will still be responsible for some of the most important decisions affecting Ryanair, 
including merger and acquisition opportunities, reducing costs and acquiring aircraft.
Ryanair could not be reached for comment.

 Airlines and travel operators had a busy week as both TUI and Thomas Cook warned on lower margins, Ryanair 
swung to a loss and easyJet stepped up Brexit preparations.
In other key retail and consumer services news, Ocado reported a fire at one of its robotic warehouse, while data 
showed increases in both UK retail and grocery sales. 
Travel and airline operator TUI, in a surprise trading update, said that the out-of-the-ordinary hot weather in the 
summer resulted in later bookings, weakening margins. It also said continued weakness in Sterling made it difficult 
to improve margins.
TUI said that annual earnings for its current financial year will be "broadly stable" on last year due to "extraordinary" 
hot weather and the weakness of the pound.
For the year ending September 30, the company expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortisation to be broadly stable on the record performance in the prior year of EUR1.17 billion.
As a result of the "broadly stable" earnings guidance, the FTSE100 listed company said it will be unable to meet its 
guidance of at least 10% compound annual growth rate in underlying Ebitda at constant currency for the three years 
to 2020 financial year.
Similarly, on Thursday rival Thomas Cook also reported a year-on-year fall in first quarter gross margins due to cut 
throat competitive market in the UK and weak demand for winter holidays in the Nordics. 
The company also announced a strategic review of its airline business, which could potentially lead to a sale.
"As expected, the knock-on effect from the prolonged summer heatwave and high prices in the Canaries have 
impacted customer demand for winter sun," Thomas Cook Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser said.
CONSUMER SERVICES SECTOR REVIEW: Airlines Brace For Turbulence Ahead
Thomas Cook's revenue for the first quarter to end of 2018 rose 1% to GBP1.66 billion but the company's adjusted 
operating loss widened by GBP14 million to GBP60 million.
TUI shares were trading down 2.1% at 934.80 pence each on Friday, while Thomas Cook was down 16% at 
28.64p, retreating from gains made on Thursday. 
In the budget airlines sector, Ryanair announced changes to its corporate structure after posting a third-quarter loss 
and warning of lower annual profit.
The Irish airliner on Monday said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure "not dissimilar" to 
that of rival and British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group PLC.
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary will become group CEO, leading all the units, the airline said. O'Leary 
committed to further five years at the head of the company.
Ryanair said its third-quarter results to the end of 2018 were "disappointing", with the group swinging to a EUR83.6 
million pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago.
Revenue increased 9% in the third quarter to EUR1.53 billion from EUR1.41 billion on the back of higher customer 
numbers, up to 32.7 million from 30.4 million a year ago.
Looking ahead, Ryanair expects annual profit to be between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion, down up to 31% 
from comparative period, due to lower winter fares but better-than-expected cost performance in the second half. 
The company posted a profit of EUR1.45 billion for 2017 financial year.
With regards to Brexit, Ryanair - which had previously warned on the "underestimated" risk of a no-deal - said it has 
taken all the "necessary steps" to protect the company.
With Brexit just 49 days away, peer easyJet on Thursday also said it increased its EU ownership to 49% in order to 
be able to continue flying in Europe after the UK's exit from the European Union in March.
easyJet said it remains confident of its ability to continue flying whatever the outcome, as it has "undertaken 
significant preparations" since the vote of the referendum was delivered.
One of the major news in the retail sector this week was delivered by online grocer Ocado. 
Ocado on Tuesday reported a widened annual loss and a major fire at one of its warehouses. The company's 
earnings were hampered by higher operating costs in a year of major expansion that saw the online grocer ink 
several significant deals.
For the financial year to December 2, 2018, revenue rose by 9.9% to GBP1.59 billion from GBP1.45 billion a year 
prior, on the back of an increase in average number of orders a week and fees from partnerships.
However, Ocado's pretax loss came in at GBP44.4 million, widened from GBP8.3 million a year prior. Financial 
2017 results were restated after the adoption of new accounting rule IFRS15, last year the grocer had reported a 
GBP1.0 million profit.
The pretax loss was significantly wider than analysts expectations, which had forecast Ocado's loss at GBP30.0 
million. 
During the year, Ocado inked deals with US retailer Kroger, Swedish supermarket group ICA, France's Groupe 
Casino and in Canada with Sobeys, as retailers lined-up to secure UK company's cutting-edge technology, which 
includes robots in warehouses.

Retail Ebitda is expected to grow, as the increased use of automated warehouses, called customer fulfillment 
centres, brings in cost savings and synergies, Ocado said.
It was at one of this warehouses in Andover, England, that a fire broke on Tuesday, just after the company 
announced its results. 
After continuing to burn overnight, Ocado said that the fire caused "substantial damage" to both the Andover 
building and its contents, as part of the roof collapsed.
"Ocado is working hard to minimise disruption for customers by increasing capacity at other facilities," it added.
Due to the presence of pressurised refrigerants on site causing risk of explosions, the area around the warehouse 
had to be evacuated on Wednesday night. 
Since then, the refrigerants have been removed from the site and the "major incident status" and evacuation have 
been lifted.
Ocado shares were trading up 2.0% at 891.20p each on Friday. On Monday, before news of the fire broke, Ocado 
shares were trading at 1000.50p. 
A wider overlook on the beleaguered retail sector led to a breath of fresh air, as UK retail sales picked up in January 
following the worst December in a decade. 
On Tuesday, the latest BRC-KPMG Retail Sales Monitor figures covering the four weeks to January 26, showed UK 
retail sales up 2.2% from the year before, as heavy discounting tempted cautious shoppers. 
This marked the highest annual growth since June and was above both the 3-month and 12-month averages of 
0.8% and 1.2% respectively. In December, total sales were flat compared to the prior year, marking the worst 
December performance since 2008.
"There was a welcome return to growth this month after December's disappointing sales figures. But while retail 
discounts helped tempt cautious consumers, there is no guarantee this momentum will continue after the sales 
have finished," Chief Executive Officer of the British Retail Consortium Helen Dickinson said.
Supermarkets also had reasons to celebrate this week, as data from Kantar Woldpanel covering the 12 weeks to 
January 27, saw UK grocery sales up 1.7% on the prior year.
However, despite reporting rising sales, all supermarkets, with the exception of Aldi, Lidl and Co-op, saw their 
market share dip on the prior year. The only grocer slipping, in sales, was Sainsbury's with sales down 0.3% during 
the period.
Grocery inflation now stands at 1.3%, Kantar reported, with prices rising since January 2017.

Thomas Cook Could Sell Airline Business To Raise Badly Needed Cash

Feb 08, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Thomas Cook 
Group plc, the world's oldest travel company, is resorting to all available options -- including selling the four firms 
that comprise its airline business -- to raise enough cash to cope with the far more difficult year of 2019. It racked-
up huge losses in 2018 when the drought and heat wave in northern Europe during the spring and summer deterred 
holiday makers from booking last minute deals. The resultant loss in revenue triggered two major profit warnings, 
and talk of a need to raise more capital. 
Thomas Cook's willingness to do what it takes to get its house into order saw Wall Street send the group's shares 
12 percent higher yesterday. The companyhad a market valuation of $700 million (540 million) pounds and net debt 
of $2.1 billion (1.6 billion) in 2018. "Thomas Cook doesn't needto own an airline outright to be a successful holiday 
company,' said CEO Peter Fankhauser[1]. The company's airline business consists of Thomas Cook Airlines, 
Thomas Cook Airlines Balearics, Thomas Cook Airlines Scandinavia and Condor (in Germany). It posted a 37 
percent rise in operating profit in 2018, which was far better than the company's core tour business. Analysts said 
Thomas Cook's airline business could fetch from $2.3 billion (1.8 billion) to $4.1 billion (3.2 billion). Together, the 
four carriers operate 103 aircraft. Fankhauser revealed a review is being conducted and said the company will 
retain strong links to the carrier whatever the outcome. Selling its airlines will enable the parent company to invest 
more in its own hotels. There will also be funds to improve its digital sales offerings. Fankhauser said the review is 
at an early stage and will likely to take several months. Lufthansa, easyJet, IAG and Ryanair might be interested in 
different parts of Thomas Cook's airline business, according to Credit Suisse. An airbus A320 of the Thomas Cook

PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/Getty Images Analysts said selling these airlines won't be easy given turmoil in the 
European airline industry, which saw the bankruptcy only this Feb. 4 of the 40 year-old, privately-owned airline 
Germania. They said there won't be a rush to buy Thomas Cook's entire airline fleet, or even parts of it. European 
tour operator bookings are 12 percent lower for the summer. Thomas Cook said this reflected consumer 
uncertainty, especially in the United Kingdom where concerns about Brexit are hammering consumer confidence. [

It is perhaps easy to lump the demise of Germania in with the list of recent European airline failures – assuming it to 
be yet another casualty of a harsh market environment, and proof of the need for consolidation.
Berlin-based Germania pointed to tough conditions last month when it disclosed that it was seeking a financial 
rescue package. It blamed a rise in fuel prices in 2018, coupled with the weakening of the euro against the US 
dollar. It also highlighted delays in the phase-in of new aircraft as the major cause of its liquidity crisis.
But to blame everything on conditions is to omit the role that Germania's own strategy may have played in its 
demise.
'TORRID' MARKET
There has been no shortage of commentary recently on challenges in the German market.
On 4 February, Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary labelled Germany a "torrid" market, saying there was "no 
sign" of stronger yields there.
Three days later, Norwegian chief executive Bjorn Kjos described the German leisure market as a "bloodbath, with 
all the actors coming in" – and TUI chief executive Friedrich Joussen has meanwhile highlighted "significant" 
overcapacity in Germany.
"The volumes are there but the yield is not," argues Joussen.
ANALYSIS: How tough conditions exposed Germania's flawed strategy It is perhaps easy to lump the demise 
of Germania in with the list of recent European airline ....
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that despite high-profile airline failures such as the collapses of Air Berlin in 
2017, XL Airways Germany in 2013 and LTU International in 2011, the German short-haul sector has grown 
strongly over the past decade.
In 2010, total seats offered on scheduled flights between Germany and Europe reached some 178 million. Apart 
from 2012, when seat totals were almost flat, and 2013 when they dipped slightly, scheduled seats grew by roughly 
5-10 million per year. In 2017, that trend accelerated when 11 million seats were added, for a total of 216 million.
Seats grew by 13 million in 2019, to 235 million.
AGGRESSIVE GROWTH
Germania's own story over the past decade has also been one of rapid growth, beginning with the establishment of 
wholly owned maintenance arm Germania Technik Brandenburg, in 2011.
A year later, it founded West African-based Gambia Bird Airlines. A Swiss subsidiary called Germania Flug was 
established in 2014, and 2017 brought the creation of ACMI specialist Bulgarian Eagle. These latter two continue to 
operate despite Germania's insolvency.
In July 2016, the carrier ordered 25 Airbus A320neos, which, it would later transpire, were intended to completely 
replace Germania's Boeing 737 fleet.
Elsewhere, Germania established itself in some unlikely places, becoming a major player in Kosovo and offering 
connections to destinations in Iran and Iraq.
Air Berlin's weakening and subsequent collapse in 2017 spurred Germania to accelerate its expansion plans.
The two airlines had had an unusual relationship over the decades, marked by both fierce competition and co-
operation. They shared a technical base at Berlin Schonefeld and in 2005, there had begun a period when both 
airlines were managed by then Air Berlin chief executive Joachim Hunold.
But as the then Etihad partner airline began to shrink, Germania moved into its vacated space.
In 2017, Air Berlin opened a base in Majorca, a market in which the carrier was reducing capacity at the time. 
Schonefeld-based Germania also opened a new base at Tegel – Air Berlin's then headquarters.
Elsewhere, Germania increased its activity in Dusseldorf and added capacity from places such as Zurich to 
traditional Air Berlin markets such as the Canary Islands.
Carl Denton, managing director of Sven Carlson Aviation Consulting, believes that this attempt to "fill the gap" that 
was left by the collapse of Air Berlin may have backfired on Germania.
He says that replacing Air Berlin proved to be a "massive distraction", with "a lot of people chasing replacement 
capacity", leading to a collapse in yields in those markets.
Denton says market conditions such as the fuel price and currency issues do not tell the full story of Germania's 
demise because "that's the same for everyone".
In a similarity with the now-defunct Monarch, Denton says, Germania suffered from being at the "end of the food 
chain", with passengers and tour operators preferring to use the likes of Lufthansa and EasyJet.
The carrier's strategy, from 2017, of adding capacity into smaller German cities may have left Germania exposed to 
wider market dynamics, he posits.
Germania's operations at these secondary airports were typically "costly types of operations that were more thirsty 
on crew and overhead", says Denton.
ANALYSIS: How tough conditions exposed Germania's flawed strategy It is perhaps easy to lump the demise 
of Germania in with the list of recent European airline ....
Secondary airports, he notes, are also the first places to shrink in a "contracting market".
Finally, Denton says the compensation the Berlin-based carrier paid out for flight delays under EU rules may have 
played a part in its collapse.
In an analyst note released on 5 February, Bernstein senior research analyst Daniel Roeska noted Germania's 
"aggressive growth" story in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, with the Berlin-based carrier expanding from 
approximately 500,000 seats per year in 2008 to almost 6 million planned for 2019.
Peter Morris, chief economist at Flight Ascend Consultancy, says Germania's chief challenge was that, like Air 
Berlin, it was "caught between two increasingly polarised business models in Europe".
He recalls a strategy presentation that the airline's chief executive, Karsten Balke, gave in 2017. Balke stated that 
Germania was seeking to avoid competing with low-cost carriers and full-service operators, to instead focus on 
what Morris calls the "shrinking middle" of focusing on niche tourism markets while offering a high-quality product.
At the same time, Morris says, there is evidence that Germania was "spread very thin" – trying to offer too many 
frequencies on too many routes.
While Germania was growing, so too was Lufthansa Group, with both companies expanding as Air Berlin shrank. 
The German airline group has made it clear it intends for its subsidiary Eurowings to become a major player, not 
just in Germany but across Europe, while its war of attrition with low-cost carriers in its German core markets will 
have only made the market tougher for Germania.
The financial data that is available suggests that Germania's growth was not translating into profits.
In February 2017, the carrier's director of sales, routes and systems Claus Altenburg indicated that the leisure 
carrier was eyeing a profit that year after struggling to break even amid turmoil in Turkey and Egypt the previous 
year.
Financial data published in the Bundesanzeiger register shows that Germania incurred a net loss of 7.7 million 
($8.7 million) in 2016 – the most recent information available – a rise from 6.8 million in 2015.
IMPACT
FlightGlobal schedules data indicates that the collapse of Germania will have little impact on overall seat numbers 
in its home country.
The data shows that the leisure airline accounts for less than 1% of the total seat capacity from Germany as of 
February, equating to just over 100,000 seats. Even in Berlin, it accounts for just 1.6% of seats.
Jorgen Kearsley, general manager for aviation marketing at Hamburg airport, says the collapse of Germania will 
have a limited impact on the gateway. The airline was responsible for approximately 145,000 passengers per year 
and had one aircraft stationed at Hamburg, he says.
Perhaps two-thirds of passengers were delivered by tour operators, Kearsley says, adding: "I think these tour 
operators will find other carriers [to fill the void]."
But it may prove difficult to attract a new airline to take over some of Germania's routes, such as Tel Aviv, that 
represented quite "long legs" from Hamburg, he adds.
Kearsley says airports such as Bremen, Munster Osnabruck, Nuremberg and Rostock are more exposed by 
Germania's collapse. Erfurt, where Kearsley says the leisure carrier accounted for some 80% of traffic, will be 
particularly badly affected, he believes.
ANALYSIS: How tough conditions exposed Germania's flawed strategy It is perhaps easy to lump the demise 
of Germania in with the list of recent European airline ....
FlightGlobal schedules data shows that Germania accounted for 10% of the market at Bremen. The airline is 
meanwhile one of only two scheduled airlines serving Rostock in February.
"It will be for these smaller airports to replace Germania," Kearsley says, adding that the question now is whether 
the tour operators in northern Germany can find alternatives.
He theorises that consolidation could occur, with tour companies deciding to centralise their businesses at larger 
airports – such as Hamburg – at the possible expense of smaller German gateways.
Roeska says the "clear beneficiary" of Germania's bankruptcy will be SunExpress, a joint venture between 
Lufthansa Group and Turkish Airlines. TUI and Thomas Cook can also expect to benefit, and to a lesser extent 
EasyJet and Ryanair.
"We would expect the bankruptcy of Germania to prompt tour operators to quickly buy short-term capacity, 
especially for already-booked Easter vacations," he adds.
In a note published on the same day, Goodbody aviation analyst Mark Simpson says a number of slots at German 
airports will now be up for grabs, which he expects will be of "interest" to Ryanair and its Laudamotion unit, which is 
"heavily focused on German to Spain flows", with Palma slots being particularly valuable.
EasyJet, Wizz Air and Lufthansa Group will likely "pick up" further slots at more regional airports, Simpson adds.
In a note issued on 5 February, Credit Suisse head of European transport equity research Neil Glynn suggests that 
the collapse of Germania may "ease pricing pressure on German short-haul routes".
Germania's fleet of 28 narrowbodies consists of 18 A319s, 6 A321s and four 737s. Most of its fleet is leased.
Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that World Star Aviation, accounting for seven of the A319s in Germania's fleet, is the 
most exposed lessor.
The airline had 25 A320neos on order.
Germania also uses a hangar at Berlin Brandenburg, and rents one in Bremen. The hangar in Brandenburg had 
been Air Berlin's, with half of it assigned to Germania.
The other half is used by Lufthansa Technik's business-jet maintenance joint venture with Bombardier, Lufthansa 
Bombardier Aviation Services, and the MRO provider may seek to take over the facility completely.

Feb 08, 2019( Transcript Daily: https://transcriptdaily.com Delivered by Newstex)  Headlines about Royal Dutch 
Shell (LON:RDSA) have trended somewhat positive this week, according to InfoTrie. The research firm ranks the 
sentiment of press coverage by monitoring more than 6,000 blog and news sources in real time. The firm ranks 
coverage of public companies on a scale of negative five to positive five, with scores nearest to five being the most

Why Thomas Cook thinks a £1bn airline deal is just the ticket
Why Thomas Cook thinks a £1bn airline deal is just the ticket

"How was your holiday?" It's a question that most Britons will answer with "Good thanks, although the 
weather/food/hotel was a bit [insert adjective conveying mild disappointment]". Occasionally, some will insist on 
sharing unnecessary Facebook photos of unnecessarily sunburnt faces. But no one would ever reply: "Oh, the 
Gatwick Wetherspoon's was a real hidden gem, and the flight to Palma a truly uplifting experience." And that is one 
reason why Thomas Cook is selling its airline business.
In the same way that no one ever buys seven nights in Majorca in order to spend two hours on a Boeing 737, the 
travel group thinks no one buys its shares in order to own an airline. Especially an airline with a 3.7 per cent 
operating margin. They buy Thomas Cook's shares because they think it can open more own-brand hotels with a 
14 per cent operating margin. And that is the other reason why Thomas Cook is selling its airline business.
In the same way that Brits with maxed-out credit cards can't afford chichi holiday resorts, the travel group can't 
afford to invest in hotels with £1.6bn of net debt on its balance sheet. But selling all or part of its airline business 
could help pay down this debt without requiring an equity fundraising - and leave capital for investment. This 
prospect had Barclays analysts sounding like a stag party applying aftersun before a Balearic beach party: "Relief 
(balance sheet), Excitement (airline strategic review)."
For many, then, the big question about an airline deal is "Cuánto cuesta?" Thomas Cook's airline business comes 
with attractive landing slots at capacity constrained airports, such as Frankfurt and Gatwick. It also comes with 9m 
seats a year - 45 per cent of capacity - booked by Thomas Cook leisure customers. It is therefore likely to appeal to 
the likes of easyJet and Ryanair. But it has also diversified into long haul. So it might attract Lufthansa and IAG, too. 
Why Thomas Cook thinks a £1bn airline deal is just the ticket
Applying an earnings multiple near the average for these rivals gives a valuation of £1bn-£1.5bn. But applying the 
highest enterprise value to sales multiple got one analyst to £3.2bn.
That would more than enough to repay net debt that currently peaks at £1.6bn in winter - when costs have been 
incurred but bookings not yet secured - before falling to nearer £400m by the financial year end.
Several hundred million should be left for hotel spending money.
But before investors order up the pina coladas, a couple of sobering thoughts. Thomas Cook will need to do an 
airline deal that brings co-operation from the new owner - to keep flying its holidaymakers to Palma and beyond. 
That may bring the proceeds down to nearer Citi's £630m sum-of-the-parts valuation. Then it will find itself as a 
pure tour operator selling holidays in a price-war zone. Thomas Cook had been cutting capacity to lift prices. But 
earlier this week, rival Tui indicated it would slash prices to protect market share. Wish you were here? Investors 
might answer: "Not yet."

Home is where the heart is, the old saying goes. And for the analysts over at Cantor Fitzgerald, home shopping is 
where the smart money is. They think the Manchesterheadquartered retail conglomorate Findel, which sells through 
several brands including Studio via its websites and catalogues, is managing its digital transition well. "We are 
pleased to see that Studio continues to carry good underlying momentum following the investment in customer 
recruitment in recent years," analysts said in a note. They rated it "buy" at a target price of 340p.
Wagamama is known for its Asian fusion, but Frankie & Benny's owner The Restaurant Group might find fusing the 
chain into its existing portfolio is the greatest challenge. Barclays analysts are on the fence: weighing the value of 
an "excellent asset" against the pitfalls of the current dining economy. "We believe there is too much focus on 
synergies (deals look great in a spreadsheet) and too little analysis of 'dis-synergies'," analysts said, pointing to a 
danger of "value destruction" if integration goes poorly. The rated it "neutral" at a lowered target price of 165p.
After a fair bit of turbulence, analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald are ready to strap in for take-off at budget airline Ryanair 
once again. "Deep fare discounting kept cabins full but the resulting lower yields and higher costs squeezed 
margins. The outlook is a bit brighter," they wrote. The analysts point to a plateau in employee costs, and an end to 
the structural issues that have plagued the airline. "The turnaround of recent acquisition Laudamotion is on track 
and should provide good incremental growth over the medium term," they wrote, rating it "buy" at a target price of

Feb 06, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  After reportedly 
being forced to wait on the aircraft for more than six hours without any food or drinks, nearly 200 Ryanair 
passengers reached their destination after 26 hours of delay on Monday. Ryanair Flight FR2767 from Prague to 
Madridwas grounded at the Vaclav Havel Airport around 9 a.m. local time (3 a.m. EST) on Feb. 3 with 189 
passengers on board, due to severe ongoing snowstorm. 
The pilot of the plane later told local media the airport staff were unsuccessful in de-icing the plane on the day, 
which caused the delay. According to the Sun[1], the passengers who were kept from deplaning, grew extremely 
anxious as they were not provided with any refreshments while they waited to receive updates from the crew 
members onboard. Many of them took to Twitter to vent out their anger. 'Five hours of flight delay. Telling us that 
we were given information (at no time they have) every 15 minutes. They leave us on the plane with a thermal feel 
of minus 10 degrees and waiting in the snow with their feet in the ground. Not a single apology @Ryanair_ES??? 
Embarrassing,' Argimiro Prez, one of the passengers present on the flight, wrote, adding that there were parents 
who were growing concerned for their young ones and at least one person who had fallen sick as they were being 
forced to wait.After six hours, another passenger, who goes by the Twitter handle @Pharol_Oi, wrote: 'Thanks to 
the pressure of the media and social networks finally cancel the flight #FR2767 of #Ryanair and free passengers 
who have been almost sevenhours 'kidnapped'inside the plane without any explanation." However, aspokesperson 
for the airline, in a statement issued to the Sun regarding Flight FR2767, saidafterthe flight was grounded, "Crew 
opened the bars on-board and served refreshments." Following the cancellation of the flight, the passengers were 
allowed to leave the plane. They had to battle the freezing temperatures and chilling winds outside to get back to 
the airport hotel, where they spent the rest of the night. A spokesperson for Menzies Aviation, which provides 
services for Ryanair at the Prague airport, told the media that the passengers were scheduled todepart for Madrid 
on Feb. 4, at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. EST). However, Prez Tweeted on Monday, saying their plane was delayed 
yet again that day.[2]According to Flight Stats[3], a flight tracking site, the plane finallyarrived atAdolfo Suarez 
Madrid-Barajas Airport in Madrid at 3:21 p.m. local time (9:21 a.m. EST). Ryanair tweeted[4]confirming the delays: 
"Snow at Prague airport and slow de-icing services have caused delays. One of our flights has been cancelled as 
the crew went out of hours. All customers have been provided with hotel accommodation and the flight will operate 
tomorrow. We apologize to impacted customers and we are working hard to operate all flights as normal." Ryanair

Europe's low-cost carrier woes persist as Germania collapses Airlines

The long list of aviation bankruptcies in the European low-cost airline market grew yesterday as Berlin-based 
Germania ceased operations.
The company collapsed as it was unable to secure financing to fund itself after a troubled year that included high 
fuel prices and unexpected aircraft maintenance.
Karsten Balke, Germania's chief executive, said: "We very much regret that, consequently, our only option was to 
file for insolvency."
Germania joins the growing list of European airlines to fail in the past two years. In 2017, three large carriers went 
bankrupt in quick succession: Monarch in the UK; Air Berlin; and Alitalia.
Then, last autumn, a number of smaller airlines failed: Latvia-based Primera, Cobalt of Cyprus, Germany's Azurair, 
Lithuania's Small Planet Airlines and the Swiss SkyWork. The failures have led to a wave of consolidation. On 
Monday, Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary warned that the European airline industry faced more consolidation and 
bankruptcies as his group recorded a "disappointing" (EURO)22m loss for the third quarter, its first loss since 2014. 
EasyJet has also warned recently that it faces significant falls in per seat revenues. Profits at Wizz are sharply 
down and Norwegian has announced an emergency rights issue to help confront concerns about its finances.
Germania, which has 37 planes and flew 4m passengers last year, had announced in January that "unforeseeable 
events", such as 2018's rise in fuel prices and the euro weakening against the dollar, had been "major burdens".
Europe's low-cost carrier woes persist as Germania collapses Airlines
Founded in 1986 by Hinrich Bischoff, it was sold to a private owner in 2014. The company's Swiss and Bulgarian 
subsidiaries were not affected by the bankruptcy, it said.
Although each company has its own difficulties, they all face downward pressures on seat prices as capacity in the 
European low-cost sector expands.
Another problem has been rising fuel costs. The price of a barrel of jet fuel peaked at $86 in early October, having 
been on the rise since early 2016, when it was below $30.
Some airlines, like Germania, were unable to hedge their exposure to fuel, while Ryanair's hedging - at too high a 
level - was "poor", according to Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC.

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Ryanair's decision to emulate the IAG group structure is perhaps an 
admission by the great disruptor of European air travel that it can learn from its rival when it comes to effectively 
managing an increasingly complex business.
A myriad of challenges and opportunities over recent years – from navigating the complexities of Brexit and the 
collapse of Air Berlin in 2017, to labour problems in Ireland and burgeoning demand for charter travel in Poland – 
have left Ryanair with four operating units: the main Ryanair operation, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK.
These are now to be put under a more formal management structure, with each airline to be run by its own chief 
executive reporting to Michael O'Leary as the group's overall boss.
Speaking on an analysts' call on 4 February, O'Leary was unstinting in his praise for Willie Walsh's creation of the 
IAG group structure to manage his airlines and of his desire to mirror his fellow Irish businessman's achievement.
"I have always been impressed with the way Willie [Walsh] has managed IAG – the turnaround, for example, of 
Iberia using different brands such as Vueling. He has driven a lot of cost efficiency in Iberia and in BA.
"And looking at [a] kind of management succession, again, I think the way that Willie has taken care of Alex Cruz – 
[to take him] out of Vueling and put him into BA... There's much more mobility between the management teams. I 
think [that] also gives us an opportunity," he says.
O'Leary expects that the new structure will allow Ryanair Holdings to allocate capital across its subsidiaries. This 
will "encourage each of the airlines to compete actively for capital and aircraft", he says.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair matures with IAG-style structure; If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Ryanair's 
decision to emulate the IAG group structure is per....
"I think the critical thing that each of the airline chief executives will need to understand though that if you want to 
grow, you are going to compete with the other airlines for the next aircraft, or the next 10 aircraft, [or the] next 20 
aircraft.
"So go ahead and demonstrate that you can get better growth incentives from airports or better handling deals, you 
can do a better job, and then we will reward that with more aircraft," he adds.
A key challenge will be finding the right chief executive to succeed him at Ryanair mainline, O'Leary acknowledges. 
He expects he will need to "hold his or her hand" over the first year so that "we don’t lose the focus".
O'Leary also believes the new group structure will make it easier for Ryanair to pursue "smaller" M&A opportunities, 
along similar lines to its acquisition of Laudamotion.
The new management team will start out "very small", comprising O'Leary himself and group-level legal and finance 
functions which will evolve over the next 12 months. "We are not going to have a big group office. There isn't going 
to be a lot of infrastructure," he says.
Central functions will include the work of Ryanair Labs and some group marketing, which will be "adapted or 
adopted by the other companies".
In general, though, O'Leary seems to see far more benefits percolating upwards than downwards in the new model, 
with procurement increasingly done at a local level and more opportunities for individuals to shine.
As an example, he says he is "certainly looking" for the group's Polish arm Ryanair Sun to provide pilot training for 
the wider business.
He also sees a "big opportunity" for middle management to take advantage of the new model to rise through the 
ranks.
"While we have a reasonably stable senior management team, there was always a view here – or a kind of a bit of 
a pushback – that 'My way forward is blocked; I can't get further; how do I rise through the organisation?' And we 
will be encouraging more people," he says.
O'Leary also says that Ryanair Holdings will seek to nurture the multicultural nature of its operating units to drive 
future performance, with Laudamotion’s Austrian mindset complementing the Irish business practices at the Dublin-
based carrier.
WELCOME MOVE
Market analysts have widely welcomed the move as a tonic to the union and boardroom challenges that the carrier 
has been experiencing.
In an investor note published today, Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, write that the new structure will 
facilitate Ryanair evolution into a "future unionised business".
He describes Ryanair chief operating officer Peter Bellew as an "obvious candidate" to succeed O’Leary as head of 
the mainline carrier.
Bellew "has consistently taken a firm, yet more conciliatory stance towards organised labour than chief executive 
O'Leary", Lobbenberg opines.
Gerald Khoo, transport analyst at Liberum, tells FlightGlobal that the new group structure will allow O'Leary to give 
up the day-to-day management of the airlines and focus on the more "strategic aspects" of the role.
"However, you can bet that he will still be very hands-on if things aren't going the right way. The biggest challenge 
will be for him to delegate and give the subsidiary CEOs enough room for manoeuvre," he adds.
ANALYSIS: Ryanair matures with IAG-style structure; If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Ryanair's 
decision to emulate the IAG group structure is per....
Peter Morris, chief economist at Flight Ascend Consultancy, says Ryanair has become a "big, if not huge beast" 
that is now "surely past the point" where it can be run by a single individual.
"It is the classic challenge of business transition which fast-growing, successful companies face, but here multiplied 
across virtually all European countries and seldom out of the news or political debate," he adds.
In a note issued on 4 February, Neil Glynn, head of European transport equity research at Credit Suisse, predicts 
that the new structure will afford Ryanair the opportunity to return to "prior profitability levels" having experienced 
deteriorating financial results in the last quarter.
He says the move will give management more time to "strategise" and will provide a "backdrop" for them to focus 
on refreshing Ryanair's "Always Getting Better" customer-service programme and provide "greater clarity on 
medium-term top-line prospects".
BONDERMAN EXIT
Along with the announcement of a new group structure, Ryanair is also rejigging its upper management team, with 
chairman David Bonderman set to stand step down in 2020.
Bonderman, who joined the board in 1996, will continue in his post this year but will not seek re-election in 2020. 
Ryanair says Stan McCarthy, former chief executive of food company Kerry Group, will take up the post of deputy 
chairman from April this year and move to become chairman in summer 2020.
Kyran McLaughlin, who has been on the Ryanair board since 2001, is also to step down from his position as non-
executive director in 2020.
Ryanair will no doubt hope the moves will end the shareholder murmurings of last year as to Bonderman's 
continued suitability for the role. Again, analysts have welcomed the move, with Khoo describing the changes as 
"long overdue".
He adds: "The extraordinarily long tenure of Bonderman and McLaughlin rightly brought into question whether they 
were offering sufficient challenge to management, having been closely associated with so many decisions of the 
past.
"It will be interesting to see whether the commitment to go by the 2020 AGM [annual general meeting] is enough to 
satisfy those who opposed their re-election at the last AGM, or whether pressure will build for them to go at this 
year's AGM given the acceptance of the need for change."
Lobbenberg described the board members' "long tenure" as being "out of line with the norms of corporate 
governance".
The International Transport Workers' Federation and its European counterpart, which wrote to Ryanair 
shareholders last year urging them to vote against the re-election of Bonderman as chairman, have welcomed the 
news but with a cautionary note.
Stephen Cotton, ITF general secretary, describes Bonderman's departure as a "great victory for the global trade 
union movement" and asserts: "Having taken on one of the world's worst employers, workers have shown that 
collective action can help shift dodgy corporate practices."
He adds: "The new chair will bear a great responsibility for bringing the company's industrial relations into the 
modern era. Especially in the context of these quarterly results, that means stabilising Ryanair's business model by 
concluding robust labour agreements with unions in every country the airline operates."
So what are the prospects for the new airline group?
ANALYSIS: Ryanair matures with IAG-style structure; If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Ryanair's 
decision to emulate the IAG group structure is per....
Eduardo Chagas, general secretary of the European Transport Workers' Federation, cautions that it is "vital" that 
the new group structure "does not become yet another tool for social dumping", and that employees across its 
various units are entitled to decent pay and working conditions.
Morris says Ryanair Holdings will in years to come become a "classic management textbook study" of how best to 
select an appropriate character as the main airline chief executive, one capable of both "working with and yet 
challenging the charismatic figure of O'Leary, who is completely associated with the successful rise of Ryanair".
He concludes: "The challenges for the future may well take different forms and could need different approaches 
from those that worked in the past."

After a rare win over Ireland in Dublin, England's rugby players were probably relieved their new airline partner is 
British Airways and not local low-cost operator Ryanair. Being made to pay an extra (EURO)12 to check-in the 
Millennium Trophy would have been galling, to say nothing of a (EURO)10 per kilo excess weight charge on a 
forward line that tips the scales at 935kg.
English shareholders in Ryanair, however, were grateful for all its extra charges. A 26 per cent increase in "ancillary 
revenues" in the three months to December 31 lessened the impact of weaker fares, higher fuel bills and rising staff 
costs. It was not enough to prevent a first quarterly loss since 2014, though - which, at (EURO)19.6m, was worse 
than the City expected. And, unlike the England team's preferred carrier, Ryanair was also downbeat on 2019 
pricing - warning that cheaper fuel would mean excess capacity persists in the European market, weakening fares.
With the airline's hands-on boss Michael O'Leary stepping up to a group chief executive role, and chairman David 
Bonderman stepping down in 2020, Bernstein analysts concluded: "Ryanair today is a significantly different airline 
and investment case than it was 10 years ago."
But does any of that make it less of an investment case? Rather like Ireland at 9/2 to win the Rugby World Cup (or 
England at 7/1), it looks a better longterm bet than most.
While eking out more ancillary revenues may not be a sustainable strategy, actively managing a 96 per cent load 
factor while staying neutral on price looks tactically astute. Ryanair's balance sheet - it has (EURO)2.2bn gross 
cash and owns 93 per cent of its own aircraft - gives it the stamina to cope with low fares now, and then win more 
share when rational markets return and rivals fall away. Liberum analysts see "tougher ... conditions in the short 
Ryanair : the long game UK COMPANIES
term as positive ... since this clears out weaker competitors". If Ryanair can clear them out like the Irish rugby team 
at the ruck, it will soon be back to winning ways.

Michael O'Leary will step up from chief executive of Ryanair to take on a wider group role for the airline, which 
yesterday reported its first quarterly loss since 2014 amid warnings over airfares this year.
Ryanair chairman David Bonderman will also step down next year after more than 20 years, in a reshuffle of the 
airline's top management. Shareholders have been seeking to replace Mr Bonderman and senior independent 
director Kyran McLaughlin, whose departure was also announced.
Ryanair revealed the changes as it announced a "disappointing" (EURO)22m pre-tax loss for the three months to 
the end of December 2018, a swing from a (EURO)113m profit at the same time last year.
Ryanair's share price fell 2.3 per cent to (EURO)11.18 as the carrier warned that, unlike its competitors, it did not 
think that summer 2019 airfares would rise.
The airline said it would move in the next year "to a group structure not dissimilar to that of IAG", owner of British 
Airways and Iberia, with a small senior management team overseeing Ryanair, Laudamotion (based in Austria), 
Ryanair Sun (Poland) and Ryanair UK.
Mr O'Leary will be chief executive of Ryanair Holdings until at least 2024, while the airline will appoint a new chief 
executive later this year.
The move would enable more "small scale M&A" such as last year's takeover of Laudamotion, the company added.

Mr Bonderman will be succeeded as chairman by Stan McCarthy, who joined the board in 2017, "although a legend

At Ryanair's annual meeting in September 2018, almost 30 per cent of shareholders voted against the re-election of 
Mr Bonderman. Mr O'Leary had previously conceded that Mr Bonderman, who co-founded private equity business 
TPG, would step down "in the next year or two".
Mr O'Leary had not previously committed to a long-term future with Ryanair. His five-year contract will end this year.

BUDGET airline Ryanair yesterday said it suffered a (EURO)20m (£17.5m) loss in the third quarter of its financial 
year, blaming weaker ticket prices.
The airline also said that longstanding chief executive Michael O'Leary had signed a five-year contract for a new 
role of group chief executive, as the company restructures.
In the quarter to 31 December 2018 passenger numbers grew eight per cent to 32.7m and revenue grew nine per 
cent to (EURO)1.53bn.
However, lower ticket prices meant the company slipped to a (EURO)19.6m loss, compared to a (EURO)105.6m 
profit at the same period last year.
O'Leary said: "While a (EURO)20m loss in Q3 was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due to 
weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and 
future traffic growth."
Ryanair reiterated its 2019 profit guidance of (EURO)1bn to (EURO)1.1bn, citing lower winter fares, strong traffic 
growth and stronger ancillary revenue as expected factors.
The company said it cannot rule out further cuts to air fares and lower fullyear guidance as a result of Brexit. 
Ryanair said it would move to a new group structure "not dissimilar to that" of British Airways-owner International 
Airlines Group.
Ryanair slips to loss of (EURO)20m as chair plans exit
O'Leary will oversee four subsidiaries: Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK, all with their own 
chief executives and management teams.
Chair David Bonderman and senior independent director Kyran McLaughlin said they will step down from the board 
in summer 2020.
Stan McCarthy will take the role of deputy chair from April 2019, and chair from summer 2020.
Ryanair has come under pressure to change its leadership, with 30 per cent of shareholders voting against 
Bonderman's re-appointment in September.
Ryanair said Bonderman would be "a very hard act to follow".

Michael O'Leary may be handing over the controls but he is not leaving the cockpit. As part of a shake-up of 
Ryanair revealed yesterday, the chief executive will step back from the dayto-day running of the main carrier to 
become head of a holding company overseeing the group's four businesses.
Ryanair will appoint a boss at its main airline and Mr O'Leary will oversee chief executives at its carriers 
Laudamotion (based in Austria), Ryanair Sun (Poland) and Ryanair UK, formed to surmount Brexit obstacles.
Few expect the Irishman to loosen his grip on the group he has led for more than 20 years. "I don't think this is 
necessarily a stepping back; he's not the type of character who would step back," said Stephen Furlong at Davy 
Stockbrokers. Mr O'Leary will still be responsible for some of the most important decisions, including merger and 
acquisition opportunities, reducing costs, and acquiring aircraft.
Ryanair said the structure would not be "dissimilar to that of IAG", which owns British Airways and Iberia. As at IAG, 
where the heads of each airline report to Willie Walsh, the chiefs of Ryanair's subsidiaries will take their lead from 
Mr O'Leary. Some said the move was a way to cultivate a successor to Mr O'Leary. The move did not represent a 
diminution of Mr O'Leary's authority but made "the whole organisation less dependent on one person", said one 
analyst.
O'Leary remains a commanding presence at Ryanair Airlines. Shake-up ; Chief steps back but keeps grip on 
activities including M&A, cost cuts and acquiring aircr....
Mr O'Leary made a renewed commitment to Ryanair by promising to remain chief of the group until at least 2024.
His five-year contract ends this year and he had previously said he would prefer a rolling annual contract while the 
board wanted another five-year agreement.
The federated approach reflected how "the balance of opportunities ... is probably shifting beyond [the main carrier] 
Ryanair", said Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein. Ryanair has growth plans for all three of its main airlines, 
especially for Ryanair Sun, where it will compete with Wizz.
Some analysts questioned whether the structure, with semi-autonomous businesses operating in different 
countries, made as much sense for Ryanair as it did for IAG or Lufthansa, which owns Swiss and Austrian.
"It's the only framework European airlines have really found to address labour issues," said Mr Roeska. "You're 
creating an internal competition and the lowest cost gets the most aircraft." At the same time, Ryanair was "different 
to IAG and Lufthansa, where the smaller entities are bigger and more important".
Ryanair as a whole expects to have almost 460 aircraft by March 2019, of which Ryanair Sun started last summer 
with five. Laudamotion will have 19 this year while Ryanair UK will launch with one plane.
Unions, which have been engaged in intermittent strikes against Ryanair and have repeatedly clashed with Mr 
O'Leary, hoped that the overhaul - which included the proposed departure of chairman David Bonderman - would 
bring positive changes.
"The new chair will bear a great responsibility for bringing the company's industrial relations into the modern era," 
said Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation.
Disruptions at Ryanair over the past 16 months include staffing problems that caused the cancellation of thousands 
of flights in 2017 and a summer of strikes last year. Workers at Ryanair Sun have complained about being forced 
into a more precarious state of employment. Ryanair closed its Poland bases as of 2019 and said pilots and cabin 
crew could apply for jobs as self-employed contractors of Ryanair Sun.
Mr Cotton said Ryanair was "already struggling to match its fragmented use of labour agencies with the reality of 
separate negotiations with unions in multiple countries. It's hard to see how creating two new subsidiaries, plus 
keeping Laudamotion at arm's length, is going to help this situation".
The restructuring was "at best ... a convoluted waste of time and money".
Ryanair did not respond to a request for comment about labour issues. At the annual meeting in September, almost 
30 per cent of investors voted against the re-election of Mr Bonderman, head of TPG. But the group's agreement to 
replace the chairman was tempered by allowing him to stay another year.
Alan MacDougall, managing director of Pirc, which works with the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (a holder of 
about 1 per cent of Ryanair stock) said: "We would have liked Bonderman to go earlier but better late than never ... 
There is obviously a clear commitment made by the company that will be hard for it to roll back on."
Mr Bonderman will step down in 2020, to be succeeded by board member Stan McCarthy, former chief executive of 
food manufacturer Kerry Group. Additional reporting by Owen Walker

LONDON's blue-chip stocks climbed to their highest in more than two months yesterday as gains in oil shares and 
consumer staples offset deep losses in miners, while airline Ryanair slumped after a disappointing quarterly report.
The FTSE 100 index edged 0.2 per cent higher to its highest since 4 December, extending a five-day winning 
streak, after the US Fed's cautious stance last week and consensus-busting US jobs data boosted confidence.
But some gains in the exporter-heavy index evaporated as the pound handed back initial losses, while the more 
domestically focussed mid-cap index ended with a 0.2 per cent gain.
British oil majors Shell and BP held on to gains and provided the most support for the main bourse as crude prices 
earlier hit their highest so far this year on OPEC-led supply cuts and US sanctions against Venezuela's petroleum 
industry.
Cyclicals, such as miners, and dollar earners led the falls while consumer staples such as Unilever, Diageo - which 
are considered safe havens in times of economic and geopolitical stress - were in favor.
Miners broke a seven-day winning streak and suffered their worst oneday fall in more than 10 days as copper 
prices fell on concerns about slowing factory activity in China, which is the world's biggest industrial metals 
consumer.
London-listed shares in Ryanair shaved some of the day's losses to end down 2.3 per cent after Europe's biggest 
budget airline blamed falling fares for its quarterly loss and warned that overcapacity was likely to continue to 
pressure prices. On the midcaps, iron ore pellet producer Ferrexpo slumped eight per cent after it said its auditors 
received bank statements from a charity, which was set up mainly to coordinate its corporate social responsibility 
program, that contained "as-yet unexplained discrepancies."

Ferrexpo was the worst mid-cap faller, ending the day with steepest one-day decline in six months.

 Stock prices in London opened marginally higher on Monday after quiet trading in Asia overnight, while Ryanair fell 
after posting a loss in the third quarter and issuing a strident warning about Brexit. 
The FTSE 100 index was up 11.15 points, or 0.2%, at 7,031.37 in early trade. The FTSE 250 was 17.12 points 
higher, or 0.1%, at 18,828.49. The AIM All-Share was flat at 921.42.
The Cboe UK 100 was up 0.2% at 11,941.96, while the Cboe UK 250 was up 0.1% at 16,815.87. The Cboe UK 
Small Companies also was up 0.1%, at 11,287.85.
In mainland Europe, the CAC 40 in Paris and the DAX 30 in Frankfurt were down 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively. 
On the London Stock Exchange, GVC Holdings was the best blue-chip performer, up 1.8% after Jefferies started 
coverage on the sports betting and gaming company with a Buy rating.
WM Morrison Supermarkets was up 1.3% after Citigroup raised the supermarket chain to Neutral from Sell.
At the other end of the large cap index, miners were lower. Rio Tinto was down 1.3%, Glencore down 0.9%, 
Antofagasta down 1.0% and Anglo American down 0.7%. BHP Group was off 1.2% after being cut to Underweight 
from Neutral by JPMorgan. 
"Despite positive developments on the trade front, with US and China resuming dialogue, slowing Chinese demand 
appears to have taken its toll on the region and remains a cause of concern going forward," said analysts at Oxford 
Economics.
Chinese manufacturing activity shrunk to a nearly three-year low in January as underlying trends in production 
weakened and export sales increased, according to a report that was released on Friday. Survey data from IHS 
Markit showed the headline seasonally adjusted Caixin Factory Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, fell to 48.3 
from 49.7 in December. The reading was the lowest since February 2016. Any reading below 50 suggests 
contraction in the sector.

In the FTSE 250, William Hill was up 3.3% on Monday, after Jefferies started coverage on the bookmaker with a 
Buy rating and Shore Capital raised the stock to Buy from Hold. 
At the other end of the midcap index, Ferrexpo was the worst performer, down 6.0% after the iron pellet producer 
said it is conducting a comprehensive review of funds paid to a Ukrainian charity as part of its corporate social 
responsibility programme, after uncovering issues with the charity's accounts.
Ferrexpo explained its auditor Deloitte has received bank statements directly from the charity Blooming Land in 
order to verify the use of contributions by Ferrexpo.
The bank statements from the charity - which is entirely separately managed from Ferrexpo - revealed "as yet 
unexplained discrepancies". Consequently, Ferrexpo said it has decided to undertake a "comprehensive 
independent review" and is currently scoping the work.
In the first half of 2018, Ferrexpo had contributed USD9.5 million to the medical and social services charity. It has 
not made any further donations since May 2018.
Elsewhere, Ryanair Holdings was down 3.8%. The budget airline said it will make changes to its corporate structure 
after swinging to a third-quarter loss and warning of lower annual profit.
The Irish airline said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of rival 
International Consolidated Airlines Group, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia.
Meanwhile, the airline said its third-quarter results were disappointing, with the group swinging to a EUR83.6 million 
pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago.
In addition, Ryanair also raised concerns over the UK crashing out of the European Union without a trade deal. 
"The risk of a no deal Brexit remains worryingly high. While we hope that common sense will prevail, and lead to 
either a delay in Brexit, or agreement on the 21 month transition deal currently on the table, we have taken all 
necessary steps to protect Ryanair's business in a no-deal environment. We have now obtained a UK AOC to 
protect our 3 domestic UK routes, and we will place restrictions on the voting rights and share sales of non-EU 
shareholders for a period of time to ensure that Ryanair remains at all times an EU owned and EU controlled airline, 
even if the UK exits the EU without a deal," said Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary. 
Peer easyJet was the worst performer in the FTSE 100, down 1.9%. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.5% while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong closed up 0.2%. 
Financial markets in China are closed on Monday for Chinese New Year's Eve and will remain closed for the rest of 
the week for Chinese New Year. 
Hong Kong's financial markets were open for a half day on Monday and will be closed Tuesday to Thursday for the

Ryanair Swings to Loss in Third Quarter, Says Excess Supply to Keep Fares Depressed
Ryanair Swings to Loss in Third Quarter, Says Excess Supply to Keep Fares 
Depressed

 Europe's biggest budget airline Ryanair (RYAAY, RYA.L) reported a loss in its fiscal third quarter early Monday as 
excess winter capacity led to lower fares in Europe and warned summer fares were unlikely to increase given that 
oversupply was expected to continue.
The company's net loss came in at 19.6 million euros ($22.5 million) during the three months that ended December 
31, versus a profit after tax of 105.6 million euros a year ago, the Dublin, Ireland-based firm said in a statement. 
The results, however, exclude Austria's Laudamotion, a loss-making carrier in which Ryanair acquired the 
remaining 25% stake in December.
The airline slipped into the red as ex-fuel unit costs rose by 6% because of higher staff costs and elevated EU261 
costs for care and re-accommodation of passengers due to a "high number" of Air Traffic Control staff 
shortages/disruptions, outweighing a 9% jump in reported revenues to 1.53 billion euros, excluding Lauda.
Ryanair, which is 90% hedged for fiscal 2020 at about $71 per barrel and 13% for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 at 
roughly $63 per barrel, noted that higher oil prices and lower fares have over the past 4 months seen a "wave of 
failures," among other airline companies.
"In the absence of further European Union airline failures, and because of the recent fall in oil prices, which allows 
loss-making unhedged competitors to survive longer, we expect excess short-haul capacity to continue through 
2019, which will we believe lead to a weaker - not stronger - fare environment," Ryanair said in the statement.
Reiterating its profit-after-tax guidance, which was cut earlier this month because of expectations that winter fares 
would drop more than forecast, the firm said it expects to see a range of 1.0-1.1 billion euros. Prior to its profit 
warning, the airline had forecast a range of 1.1-1.2 billion euros.
Ryanair Swings to Loss in Third Quarter, Says Excess Supply to Keep Fares Depressed
"While we have reasonable visibility of our Q4 bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to airfares and/or slightly 
lower full-year guidance especially if there are unexpected Brexit and/or security developments which adversely 
impact fares for close-in bookings between now and the end of March," the group pointed out in the statement.

 The following is a summary of top news stories Monday.----------COMPANIES----------Ryanair Holdings said it will 
make changes to its corporate structure after swinging to a third-quarter loss and warning of lower annual profit. 
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary 
will become group CEO, leading all the units, the airline said. O'Leary committed to further five years at the head of 
the company. 
The airline said its third-quarter results to the end of 2018 were "disappointing", with the group swinging to a 
EUR83.6 million pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago. The results 
included a EUR61.5 million loss resulting mostly from the acquisition of Austrian airline Lauda. Excluding Lauda 
losses, Ryanair still reported a EUR6.5 million operating loss versus a EUR126.0 million profit a year before.----------
Indivior said it will divest its interest related to the Sai Bo Song tablet in China to Zhejiang Pukang Biotechnology for 
a maximum of USD122.5 million. Furthermore, the FTSE 250 drugmaker said it has entered into a deal with 
Alvogen Pine Brook restricting it from selling in the US its generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film 
products, competing with Indivior's opioid addiction treatment Suboxone. Suboxone accounts for around 80% of 
Indivior's revenue. Indivior had been granted a temporary restraining order by the US District Court for the District of 
New Jersey against Alvogen on January 24. The order will will remain in place until February 7, when a preliminary 
injunction hearing will take place.----------Ferrexpo said it is conducting a comprehensive review of funds paid to a 
Ukrainian charity as part of its corporate social responsibility programme, after uncovering issues with the charity's 
accounts. The iron pellet producer explained its auditor Deloitte has received bank statements directly from the 
charity Blooming Land in order to verify the use of contributions by Ferrexpo. The bank statements from the charity

In the first half of 2018, Ferrexpo had contributed USD9.5 million to the medical and social services charity. It has 
not made any further donations since May 2018.----------Flybe Group confirmed it received a tentative proposal from 
former Stobart Group boss Andrew Tinkler, who offered a capital injection to the airline if its takeover by Connect 
Airways does not proceed. Flybe said that Tinkler made a "very preliminary, short and highly conditional outline 
contingency proposal" for a capital injection into the company, which would only take place if the sale of Flybe's 
TOP NEWS SUMMARY: Ryanair To Reorganise As It Reports Quarterly Loss
operating business to Connect Airways were to be stopped. The proposal wasn't an offer for the entire company, 
Flybe said. However, the struggling airline said it "does not consider that the preliminary proposal offers the 
certainty required to secure the future of Flybe". "Accordingly, the board emphasizes to shareholders that it 
continues to regard the arrangements entered into with Connect Airways as being the only viable option available to 
the company which provides the security that the business needs to continue to trade successfully," Flybe said. 
Connect Airways is a joint venture among Stobart, Virgin Atlantic, and DLP Holdings, which agreed to acquire Flybe 
for 1 pence per share earlier in January.----------MARKETS----------Stocks in London were marginally higher amid 
low volatility as financial markets in China were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. The pound was down 
against the dollar after a sharp decline in UK construction PMI. Wall Street was pointed to a higher open with 
Google parent Alphabet set to report earnings after the market close in New York. ----------FTSE 100: up 0.2% at

 Ryanair Holdings on Monday said it will make changes to its corporate structure after swinging to a third-quarter 
loss and warning of lower annual profit.
The Irish budget airline said that over the next 12 months it will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of 
rival International Consolidated Airliners Group PLC, owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia.
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team will oversee the development of four airline 
subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK.
Chief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary will become group CEO, leading all the units, the airline said. The company 
will, later this year, appoint a replacement as CEO of Ryanair DAC. O'Leary also signed a contract for another five 
years as head of the company.
Chair David Bonderman and Senior Independent Director Kyran McLaughlin have agreed to remain on the 
company's board until summer 2020. They will leave after that date.
"In order to ensure a smooth succession, Stan McCarthy who joined the board in May 2017, has agreed to take up 
the position of deputy chair from April 2019, and will transition to chair of the board in summer 2020," Ryanair 
added.
Meanwhile, the airline said its third-quarter results were disappointing, with the group swinging to a EUR83.6 million 
pretax loss from a EUR112.9 million profit in the comparative period a year ago.
The company's loss included a EUR61.5 million loss resulting from the acquisition of Austrian airline Lauda. 
Excluding Lauda losses, Ryanair reported a EUR6.5 million operating loss versus a EUR126.0 million profit a year 
before.
Revenue rose 9% to EUR1.53 billion from EUR1.41 billion on the back of higher customer numbers, up to 32.7 
million from 30.4 million a year ago.
LONDON BRIEFING: Ryanair Chief Signs For 5 More Years Amid Restructure
O'Leary said: "While a EUR20 million loss in the third was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due 
to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and 
future traffic growth."
Ryanair load factor was unchanged compared to the prior year at 96%.
Looking ahead, Ryanair said that, excluding an expected "heavy" loss from Lauda in its first year of operations, its 
annual profit will come in between EUR1.0 billion and EUR1.1 billion due to lower winter fares but better-than-
expected cost performance in the second half.
A year ago, Ryanair profit was EUR1.45 billion, so the decline will be as much as 31%.
"While we have reasonable visibility of our fourth quarter bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares 
and/or slightly lower full year guidance especially if there are unexpected Brexit and/or security developments which 
adversely impact fares for close-in bookings between now and the end of March," the company added.

 Stock prices in London are seen opening marginally lower on Monday amid quiet trading in Asian markets. 
In early UK corporate news, Irish airline Ryanair announced a reorganisation, drugmaker Indivior divested its 
interests in China, and outsourcer Serco signed a big contract in Australia.
IG futures indicate the FTSE 100 index is to open 0.52 points lower at 7,019.70. The blue chip index closed up 
51.37 points, or 0.7%, at 7,020.22 on Friday. 
The Japanese Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.5%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed up 0.2% after a half-
day session. Financial markets in China are closed on Monday for Chinese New Year's Eve and will remain closed 
for the rest of the week. Hong Kong's financial markets will be closed Tuesday to Thursday for the Lunar New Year 
holiday.

LONDON MARKET PRE-OPEN: Subdued Open; Indivior Sells Interest In China
ERG deputy chairman Steve Baker, former Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson and Yeovil MP Marcus Fysh 
will join forces with former education secretary Nicky Morgan and ex-cabinet office minister Damian Green to 
examine the feasibility of the so-called Malthouse Compromise.
FTSE 250 drugmaker Indivior said it is to divest its interest related to the Sai Bo Song drug in China to the Zhejiang 
Pukang Biotechnology Co for USD122.5 million.
"The divestiture of the Sai Bo Song tablet in China is consistent with Indivior's efforts to prioritize efforts on the long-
term growth opportunities with our new depot assets, Sublocade and Perseris," said Shaun Thaxter, chief executive 
officer of Indivior. "This transaction helps us focus our resources on the highest return opportunities in the regions 
we know best, while ensuring patients in China have access to an important and transformational treatment." 
Indivior also said it has signed an agreement with Alvogen Pine Brook prohibiting the US pharmaceutical company 
from distributing or selling its generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film product in the US.
Indivior had been granted a temporary restraining order by the US District Court for the District of New Jersey 
against Alvogen on January 24.
Outsourcer Serco Group said it signed a GBP560 million contract with Bupa Health Services to support the 
Australian Defence Force. The contract has up to four one-year extensions and full operational service under the 
new contract will begin on July 1. Under the contract, Serco will be responsible for providing defence support 
services across more than 50 bases in Australia. Serco will be delivering recruitment, on-boarding, training, 
workforce management and various other employee lifecycle, account management and support functions.  Ryanair 
Holdings said it will make changes to its structure as the budget airline reported a swing to third-quarter loss and 
warned of lower annual profit. 
Under the proposed changes, a small senior management team led by Group CEO Michael O'Leary will oversee 
the development of four airline subsidiaries, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK. O'Leary has 
signed a new five-year contract to the lead the company.
Ryanair swung to a EUR83.6 million pretax loss in the third quarter from a EUR112.9 million profit in the

Ryanair sees fares falling further
Ryanair sees fares falling further

A six percent drop in fares plunged Ryanair to its first quarterly loss since 2014 and Europe's biggest budget airline 
said overcapacity was likely to continue driving ticket prices lower, albeit at a slower pace.
Monday's warning of more tough trading came as the Irish company said it had secured the services of its long-
standing chief executive Michael O'Leary for another five years.
The 57-year-old, who has led Ryanair for the past 25 years, will move to be CEO of a new group structure, 
overseeing the firm's four airline subsidiaries. He had said in September he was not sure about committing to 
another five year contract.
The weak third-quarter performance was flagged two weeks ago when Ryanair cut its profit forecast for the year 
ending March 2019 for the second time in three months, and the airline reiterated on Monday it could not rule out a 
further downgrade, noting possible uncertainty from Brexit.
The firm said recent falls in oil prices would allow loss-making rivals to survive longer, maintaining excess capacity 
in Europe as others like Ryanair add more and more planes. O'Leary said he saw an eventual reduction in capacity, 
as well as consolidation in the sector, returning over 12-18 months.
Ryanair, which makes most of its profit in the summer, said fares were down 1% so far for April to September with 
just under a fifth of bookings in place, and pointed to a "flat to slightly down-ish" trend for the year ending March 
2020 if short-haul overcapacity in Europe continues.
Ryanair's shares, down over 40% from a peak of 19.39 euros 18 months ago before it was hit by a wave of 
industrial unrest, were 4.6% lower at 10.87 euros at 0945 GMT.
Ryanair sees fares falling further
"We've seen commentary from some low cost competitors with very few bookings in place for summer 2019 
promising enormous fare growth. Frankly we do not share the optimism and in some cases the irrational optimism. 
We think we should be cautious," O'Leary said.
Ryanair's new group structure will be similar to that of British Airways-owner IAG, with four airline subsidiaries - the 
main Ryanair carrier led out of Dublin, its Austrian and Polish airlines Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun, and Ryanair 
UK - each led by their own CEOs and management teams.
O'Leary will oversee cost efficiency, capital and aircraft allocation between the airlines in his new role, as well as 
potential small scale acquisitions, all on reduced basic pay and a lower bonus.
Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said O'Leary's commitment to five more years was a positive, while Davy 
Stockbrokers' Stephen Furlong said there was little sign of him relinquishing control.
"Some of the operations are clearly going to be run at the individual subsidiary levels but is Michael O'Leary taking 
a step back? Not really and wasn't expected to," Furlong said.
Ryanair said Chairman David Bonderman, whose reappointment to a role he has held for more than 20 years was 
opposed by 30% of shareholders last year, planned to stay on until the summer of 2020, when he will be replaced 
by Stan McCarthy, the former CEO of Irish food company Kerry Group.
In its fiscal third quarter, Ryanair said an 8% rise in passenger numbers was offset by a 6% decline in average 
fares, while a 26% increase in ancillary revenues to 557 million euros was offset by higher fuel and staff costs.
The quarterly loss of 20 million euros, excluding 46.5 million euro start-up losses at Laudamotion, compared with a 
106 million euro profit in the same period a year earlier.
Ryanair reiterated its 2018-19 profit forecast of 1-1.1 billion euros, which would be down by as much as 31% on the 
previous year. In an October profit warning, the company had also blamed a summer of strikes and higher oil 
prices.
Pilot unions in some countries have suspended talks over pay conditions in protest at the threat of base closures 
and while O'Leary said the airline had made "very good progress" in those talks, he could not rule out further base 
cuts if fares keep falling.
"We believe that Ryanair needs to conclude a CLA (Collective Labour Agreement) with the British Airline Pilots 
Association (BALPA), trade through to the spring with no union disruption and keep the market informed on post-
Easter yield developments to rebuild confidence," Goodbody's Simpson wrote in a note.
"At that point we feel the market will once again place a premium on Ryanair's sustainable business model, with 
FY20 costs expected to be down year-on-year." (Reuters)

       BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT/PARIS (dpa-AFX) - European stocks were trading mixed on Monday as the 
euphoria over stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data faded a little and investors awaited further developments on 
Brexit and the U.S.-China trade dispute.  U.S.-China trade negotiations ended without concrete results last week, 
though both countries claimed progress after two days of 'candid, specific and fruitful' discussions in Washington.  
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will travel to China in mid-
February for the next round of talks, according to Xinhua. 
 On the Brexit front, U.K. MPs will meet Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay today to discuss an alternative arrangement 
to the Irish backstop.  The pan European Stoxx 600 was virtually unchanged at 359.71 in opening deals after rising 
0.3 percent on Friday.   The German DAX was marginally lower and France's CAC 40 index was declining 0.3 
percent while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 was rising 0.2 percent.   Swiss private banking group Julius Baer fell over 4 
percent after its full-year profit missed expectations.   Denmark's logistics company DSV tumbled 3 percent after its 
US$4 billion-plus bid for Panalpina hit a roadblock.  Budget carrier Flybe Group soared over 11 percent in London 
after it agreed to demand from its largest shareholder to call a general meeting in aid of removing chairman Simon 
Laffin.  Miner and commodities trader Glencore dropped 1 percent on reports that it is nearing a $500 million deal to 
buy iron ore from Brazil's Companhia Siderurgica Nacional.  Low-cost airline Ryanair Holdings slumped 4.7 percent 
after it posted a Q3 loss on higher revenues.  Deutsche Bank was marginally lower on a Bloomberg report that the 
German lender was in advanced talks on receiving an additional investment from Qatar.  Digital payments company 
Wirecard jumped 9 percent after recent steep losses as it rebutted reports by the Financial Times of alleged 
financial irregularities.  In economic releases, Sentix research group said its investor sentiment index for the euro 
zone dropped to -3.7 in February from -1.5 in the previous month. The latest score marked the lowest level in more 
than four years.  U.K. construction activity hit a 10-month low in January amid Brexit uncertainty, the latest survey 
report from Markit Economics showed.

European investors are urging regulators to protect their ability to buy the London-listed shares of several major 
companies, including Royal Dutch Shell , Unilever and Ryanair , should the UK leave the EU abruptly at the end of 
next month.
The concern of asset managers is focused on the dozens of companies whose shares trade in London - typically a 
bigger and more liquid market - and at another EU stock exchange . Britain's departure from the bloc on March 29 
without a deal would mean European fund managers could no longer buy and sell the London-traded shares of 
companies with dual listings. It has left institutional investors lobbying the European Securities and Markets 
Authority, the Paris-based regulator, to find a way to give share trading in London an " equivalent " status to that in 
the rest of the EU.
The tussle is the latest flashpoint for investors over Brexit, which has dominated UK markets since the referendum 
in 2016. Investor anxiety over dual listings has intensified as near-paralysis in the British parliament keeps alive the 
possibility of the country leaving the EU without a deal.
"There is a fair amount of industry engagement regarding this topic, with more to come in the next few weeks," said 
Monica Gogna, a partner with the law firm Dechert, which represents asset managers.
Investors seek no-deal Brexit assurance on dual listings ? European asset managers raise alarm ? Doubt over 
access to London market
Esma is under political pressure from within the EU to resist granting Londonlisted shares equal billing in the event 
of a hard Brexit, according to two people involved in the discussions. Esma said it was "aware of this issue in 
relation to the trading obligation for shares and are currently looking into it".
About 90 companies could be ensnared by the problem, the vast majority having shares that trade both in London 
and Dublin. Some Amsterdam-listed companies are also affected. The London Stock Exchange has said that EU 
investors would be forced to use the local listings to buy and sell such shares even if "liquidity is thin and the price 
is less favourable".
Shell, Unilever and Ryanair declined to comment.
The picture is further complicated because any restrictions on the ability of EU-based investors to access the 
London listings could put them in breach of Mifid II regulations requiring them to secure the best price for their 
transactions. London is often the more active and liquid market.
In a no-deal scenario, the London Stock Exchange said that EU fund managers would still be able to access stocks 
that were only listed in London.
Some lawyers worry that the dispute may lead some of the companies at risk to scrap their listing outside London, 
where UK authorities may also be more flexible in implementing some Mifid II requirements.
The Financial Conduct Authority, the City of London watchdog, which is not party to the discussions, declined to 
comment.

       BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - Shares of Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA.L, RYAAY) were losing around 5 percent in the 
early morning trading in London after the low-cost airline reported a loss in its third quarter, compared to prior year's 
profit due to weaker than expected air fares. Revenues, however, were higher. Further, for the month of January, 
Ryanair reported higher passenger traffic.  Regarding Brexit, the company noted that the risk of a 'no deal' Brexit 
remains worryingly high. 
The company said it has taken all necessary steps to protect Ryanair's business in a no-deal environment.  Over 
the next 12 months, Ryanair will move to a group structure, and Michael O'Leary will become Group CEO. A 
replacement CEO of Ryanair DAC, who will work alongside the CEOs of Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun, will be 
appointed later this year.  The company noted that O'Leary has agreed a new 5 year contract as Group CEO, which 
secures his services for the group until at least July 2024. His agreement will allow him to guide the individual 
CEO's of Ryanair, Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun, the company noted.  Regarding the results, O'Leary said, 'While 
a \xA420m loss in Q3 was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than expected air 
fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and future traffic growth. While 
ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 26 percent in Q3, this was offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs.'   
For the third quarter, loss attributable to equity holders of parent for the third-quarter was 66.1 million euros or 
0.0580 euros per share, compared to profit of 105.6 million euros or 0.0885 euros per share in the prior year. 
Ryanair reported a net loss of 19.6 million euros, excluding Lauda.  Quarterly revenue increased 9 percent to 1.53 
billion euros from prior year's 1.41 billion euros. Revenues were up 1 percent per guest, due to a strong 
performance in ancillary revenue and increased traffic.  Passenger traffic grew 8 percent to 32.7 million from 30.4 
million last year. Load factor was flat at 96 percent. However, the strong traffic growth was offset by a 6 percent 
decline in average fares to under 30 euros due to excess winter capacity in Europe.  Ancillary revenue climbed 26 
percent to 557 million euros, offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs.  As announced on January 18, Ryanair's 
fiscal year 2019 profit guidance will be in a range of 1.0 billion euros - 1.1 billion euros. The outlook reflects the 
expected decline of around 7 percent in winter fares; Stronger traffic growth of 9 percent to 142 million; Stronger 
ancillary sales as more customers choose lower cost optional services; and slightly better than expected second-
half unit cost performance, mainly lower unhedged oil prices.  Separately, the company announced that its January

total passenger traffic increased 11 percent to 10.3 million from 9.3 million, a year ago. Ryanair alone recorded 10.0 
million customers, up 7 percent from the prior year level. Laudamotion carried 0.3 million passengers, for the 
month. Load factor was 91 percent for January.  The company operated over 58,000 scheduled flights in the month 
with over 90 percent arriving on time.   In London, Ryanair shares were trading at 10.90 euros, down 4.76 percent.

1.53 billion euros, up 1% per guest, due to a strong performance in ancillary revenue and increased traffic 
stimulated by a 6% decline in average fares to under 30  euros due to excess short-haul capacity in Europe. 
Ryanair Labs continues to drive ancillary revenue.  The company said it will take delivery of first 5x B737 MAX 
'gamechanger' aircraft from April. The fiscal year 2019 is a year of investment in our people, systems and business 
as we prepare to grow to 200 million guests p.a. by 2024.  As announced on 18 January, Ryanair's fiscal year 2019 
profit guidance will be in a range of 1.0 billion euros - 1.1 billion euros, due to lower winter fares; Stronger traffic 
growth, up 9% to 142 million; Stronger ancillary sales as more customers choose lower cost optional services; and 
slightly better than expected seonc-half unit cost performance, mainly lower unhedged oil prices.  The guidance 
excludes (exceptional) start-up losses in Lauda, which have been cut from 150 million euros to 140 million euros 
primarily on the back of better than expected unit cost performance during the winter period.  Michael O'Leary has 
agreed a new 5 year contract as Group CEO, which secures his services for the group until at least July 2024. His 
agreement to commit for a 5 year period is welcome, and will give certainty our shareholders and allow him to guide 
the individual CEO's of Ryanair, Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun.  The Board had previously committed to setting out 
its succession plan before the September 2019 AGM. In that regard, David Bonderman (Chairman) and Kyran 
McLaughlin (SID) have agreed to lead the Board for 1 more year until summer 2020, but neither of them wishes to 
go forward or be considered for reelection at the September 2020 AGM. In order to ensure a smooth succession,

Ryanair is to appoint a new chief executive to run the primary airline operation as current chief Michael O'Leary 
moves up to a group leadership role to oversee a transition of the company's structure.
O'Leary has agreed to stay on for another five years, until at least July 2024, taking up the position of group chief 
executive.
But the main airline division will come under a new chief, to be appointed later this year, the company says.
The restructuring, it adds, will mean Ryanair Holdings will be organised in a manner "not dissimilar" to that of British 
Airways and Iberia parent IAG.
Over the next 12 months a senior management team will oversee the four airline subsidiaries – Ryanair, 
Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK – which will each have its own chief executive.
The holding will focus on capital allocation and cost reduction, as well as fleet expansion.
"We believe this group structure will deliver cost and operating efficiencies, while enabling the group to look at other 
small-scale merger and acquisition opportunities," the company says.
O'Leary's extended contract will "give certainty" to Ryanair's shareholders, it adds, and allow him to "guide" the 
individual management teams of the airline operations.
Chairman David Bonderman has agreed to lead the board for another year, until summer 2020, but does not wish 
to be considered for re-election at the subsequent annual general meeting.

Ryanair announces Q3 loss of 20m

Highlight: Ryanair has reported a Q3 net loss of 20m (excl. Lauda).
Body
Strong traffic growth (+8%) to 33m was offset by a 6% decline in ave. fares due to excess winter capacity in 
Europe. Stronger ancillary revenue growth (+26%) was offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs.Ryanair’s 
Michael O’Leary said:“While a &euro;20m loss in Q3 was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due 
to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and 
future traffic growth. While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 26% in Q3, this was offset by higher fuel, staff 
and EU261 costs.”Q3 highlights include:Traffic grew 8% to 33m (LF unchanged at 96%)Ave. fares fell 6% to under 
&euro;30Ancillary revenue rose 26% to &euro;557mMore union progress – 20 Jan. 
Spanish Cabin Crew agreementLauda holding increased to 100%UK AOC granted in Dec.RevenueQ3 revenue 
increased 9% to &euro;1.53bn, up 1% per guest, due to a strong performance in ancillary revenue and increased 
traffic stimulated by a 6% decline in average fares to under &euro;30 due to excess short-haul capacity in Europe. 
Ryanair Labs continues to drive ancillary revenue. In Q3 priority boarding and reserved seating grew strongly. A 
transformational improvement of our digital platform is underway (website, app & 3rd party ancillary plug-ins) and 
will be completed before year-end. This will further improve personalisation, and triple capacity, as we grow to 
200m guests p.a. and welcome over 1bn platform visits each year.Cost LeadershipRyanair has the lowest unit 
costs of any EU airline and this gap is widening. We will take delivery of our first 5x B737 MAX “gamechanger” 
aircraft from April. These aircraft have 4% more seats, are 16% more fuel efficient, have 40% lower noise emissions 
and are hedged at an average &euro;/$ rate of $1.24 out to FY24. They will drive unit cost efficiencies over the next 
5 years. As consolidation continues and weaker European airlines fail (or sell), airports are increasingly keen to 
attract Ryanair’s dependable, efficient (high load factor) traffic growth. FY19 is a year of investment in our people, 
our systems and our business as we prepare to grow to 200m guests p.a. by 2024. In Q3 ex-fuel unit costs 
increased by 6%. This includes higher staff costs, including the 20% pilot pay increases, investment in engineering 
headcount, pilot/cabin crew training, and elevated EU261 costs due to the high number of ATC staff 
shortages/disruptions in FY19. We have extended our fuel hedges and are 90% hedged for FY20 at c.$71bbl and 
13% hedged for Q1 FY21 at c.$63bbl.Balance SheetThe Group’s balance sheet (BBB+ rated) remains one of the 
Ryanair announces Q3 loss of 20m
strongest in the industry with &euro;2.2bn gross cash and 93% of our fleet owned – 60% of which is 
unencumbered. In the first 9 months of FY19 Ryanair generated almost &euro;560m net cash from operations, 
spent &euro;1.2bn on capex (primarily aircraft, simulators, engines, hangars and spare parts), returned &euro;560m 
to shareholders via share buybacks, and repaid over &euro;230m debt. As a result, net debt increased to 
&euro;1.5bn at quarter end.Lauda In December, Ryanair acquired the remaining 25% of Laudamotion. This 
Austrian airline will carry just over 4m customers in its first (start up) year, but was heavily loss making, mainly due 
to the very late release of S.18 schedules, low promotional fares, expensive aircraft leases and unhedged fuel. Due 
to recent improvements in schedules, fares and costs, the exceptional year 1 start-up loss has been reduced from 
an expected &euro;150m to approx. &euro;140m. Lauda is now gearing up for its second year with an increased 
fleet of 25 aircraft (from 19 in prior year), traffic growth to 6m guests, lower cost fuel hedges, and we expect losses 
to narrow substantially to between &euro;50m and breakeven depending on S.19 peak season yields. By year 3 
Lauda is on track to grow to over 7.5m customers and profitability.Competition & ConsolidationHigher oil prices and 
lower fares have over the past 4 months seen a wave of EU airline failures including Primera (UK & Spain), Small 
Planet and Azur (Ger), Sky Works (Swi), VLM (Bel), Cobalt (Cyprus) and Cello (UK). In addition, other bigger 
airlines like Wow (Ice), Flybe (UK), and Germania (Ger) are urgently seeking buyers or, like Norwegian, refinancing 
just to survive.Other airlines have also cut or closed bases in response to lower fares and higher fuel costs. Ryanair 
closed unprofitable bases in Bremen & Eindhoven and we cut aircraft numbers in Niederrhein and Hahn. Norwegian 
have closed multiple bases, many where they compete with Ryanair, including Rome, Las Palmas, Palma, Tenerife, 
Edinburgh & Belfast, and will cut their Dublin base from 6 to 1 aircraft in October. Wizz (Poznan), Lufthansa 
(Dusseldorf) and EasyJet (Oporto) have also announced base cuts and/or closures in recent months. We expect 
more closures and airline failures in 2019 due to overcapacity in the European market, which is causing continued 
fare weakness.Brexit The risk of a “no deal” Brexit remains worryingly high. While we hope that common sense will 
prevail, and lead to either a delay in Brexit, or agreement on the 21 month transition deal currently on the table, we 
have taken all necessary steps to protect Ryanair’s business in a no-deal environment.We have now obtained a UK 
AOC to protect our 3 domestic UK routes, and we will place restrictions on the voting rights and share sales of non-
EU shareholders for a period of time (in the event of a hard Brexit) to ensure that Ryanair remains at all times an 
EU owned and EU controlled airline, even if the UK exits the EU without a deal.Guidance (excl. Lauda)As 
announced on 18 Jan., Ryanair’s FY19 profit guidance will be in a range of &euro;1.0bn to &euro;1.1bn due 
to:Lower winter fares, which are expected to fall 7% (H2) (compared to -2% originally forecast);Stronger traffic 
growth, up 9% to 142m;Stronger ancillary sales as more customers choose lower cost optional services; andSlightly 
better than expected H2 unit cost performance, mainly lower unhedged oil prices.This guidance excludes 
(exceptional) start-up losses in Lauda, which have been cut from &euro;150m to &euro;140m primarily on the back 
of better than expected unit cost performance during the winter period.While we have reasonable visibility of our Q4 
bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares and/or slightly lower full year guidance especially if there are 
unexpected Brexit and/or security developments which adversely impact fares for close-in bookings between now 
and the end of March.We do not share the recent optimistic outlook of some competitors that Summer 2019 airfares 
will rise. In the absence of further EU airline failures, and because of the recent fall in oil prices (which allows loss 
making unhedged competitors to survive longer), we expect excess short haul capacity to continue through 2019, 
which will we believe lead to a weaker – not stronger – fare environment.Ryanair will continue to be load factor 
active / price passive in this market, which we expect will lead to lower fares for our customers, robust traffic growth 
and more casualties among already loss making competitors before the year end.”Group StructureOver the next 12 
months Ryanair Holdings Plc will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of IAG. A small senior 
management team will oversee the development of 4 airline subsidiaries; Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun 
and Ryanair UK, each with their own CEOs and management teams. Holdings will focus upon efficient capital 
allocation, cost reductions, aircraft acquisitions and small scale M&A opportunities.To lead this group structure 
Michael O’Leary will become Group CEO, a role in which he will concentrate on the development of the group. A 
replacement CEO of Ryanair DAC, who will work alongside the CEOs of Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun, will be 
appointed later this year. The Group CEO will be assisted in Holdings by small group legal and group finance 
teams. As we expand the Lauda Airbus fleet and take delivery of over 200 B737 Max aircraft, we believe this group 
structure will deliver cost and operating efficiencies, while enabling the group to look at other small scale M&A 
opportunities like the successful development of Lauda.Board SuccessionHaving agreed this group strategy as the 
best way to grow Ryanair, Sun, Lauda and other possible airline brands, Michael O’Leary has agreed a new 5 year 
contract as Group CEO, which secures his services for the group until at least July 2024. His agreement to commit

for a 5 year period is welcome, and will give certainty to our shareholders and allow him to guide the individual

who joined the Board in May 2017, has agreed to take up the position of Deputy Chairman from April 2019, and will 
transition to Chairman of the Board in summer 2020. Stan will bring his enormous international experience (as a 
former CEO of Kerry Group Plc) and leadership skills to the development of Ryanair Holdings over the coming 
years, although a legend like David Bonderman will be a very hard act to follow.

LONDON (AP) - Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary will remain for another five years, after the company overhauled its 
corporate structure and gave its longtime leader a new contract.
Europe's biggest airline by passengers said Monday it will move to a group structure called Ryanair Holdings PLC. 
O'Leary will be CEO, agreeing to a new contract through July 2024.
Ryanair Holdings will oversee the main Ryanair carrier, subsidiaries based in Poland and the U.K. as well as the 
recently acquired Austrian unit Laudamotion.
There had been questions over O'Leary's future as his contract was due to end this year.
The announcement came as the company reported a net loss of 20 million euros ($23 million) for its fiscal third 
quarter, compared with a 106 million profit the year before, due to lower fares.

Highlight: FTSE 100 gives up the day's gains as pound rises on Sun report that UK would soften port controls for 
EU goods under no-deal Brexit
Body
Update: The FTSE 100 has fallen into the red in afternoon trading as the pound rose on a report in The Sun that EU 
goods would be waved through UK ports 'for a temporary period' under a no-deal Brexit.
That helped the pound claw back losses against the dollar to trade at $1.308, flat on the day.
Sterling's move weighed on the FTSE 100, whose stocks rely on overseas markets for around three-quarters of 
their earnings.
The index fell marginally into the red, trading at 7,019, down just a single point on the day and off a high 7,044 in 
the morning's trading.
The oil price meanwhile succumbed to profit taking, having approached the $64 mark earlier in the session. A barrel 
of Brent crude was trading at $61.83, down 1.5% on the day.
(10:22) BP and Shell help FTSE hit high 
Oil giants BP (BP) and Shell (RDSb) have helped the FTSE 100 hit a two-month as the price of Brent crude jumped 
above $63 per barrel for the first time this year.
The UK blue-chip index rose 19 points, or 0.3%, to 7,039, with Shell and BP among the risers, up 1.8% at £24.26 
and 1% higher at 526.9p.
They were buoyed by a rise in the oil price, up 1% at $63.35 a barrel, as Opec-led supply cuts and US sanctions 
against Venezuela's petroleum industry drove a rally.
Meanwhile, airline stocks were in the red, knocked by the higher oil price and a weak quarterly update from Ryanair 
(RYA.I).
EasyJet (EZJ) fell 1.8% to £12.49 and British Airways owner International Airlines Group (ICAG) dropped 2p to 
651.2p.
FTSE holds above 7,000 as pound climbs on no-deal border boost
Ryanair reported a €20 million loss for the three months to the end of December, swinging from a €106 million profit 
over the same period a year ago, sending its shares 4.8% lower to €10.85.
On the FTSE 250, the Jupiter European Opportunities (JEO ) investment trust was among the biggest risers, up 
3.4% at 723p, as top holding Wirecard (WDIG.DE) recovered some ground from Friday's heavy losses, up 11.9% 
at €121.40.
Ferrexpo (FXPO) was the heaviest 'mid-cap' faller, down 11.5% at 235.8p as the iron ore pellet producer reported 
discrepancies in the bank statements of a Ukraine charitable foundation to which it made donations.

Body
Low-cost airline Ryanair on Monday reported a third quarter net loss of 20 million euros (23 million dollars), blaming 
a decline in average fare prices.
The airline said it carried 32.7 million passengers in the three months ending on December 31, an 8-per-cent 
increase on the same period last year, while revenue increased by 9 per cent to 1.53 billion euros.
However the increases were offset by rises in fuel, staff and compensation costs.
"While a 20-million-euro loss in Q3 was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than 
expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and future traffic 
growth," Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said.

       DUBLIN (dpa-AFX) - Low-cost airline Ryanair on Monday reported a third quarter net loss of 20 million euros 
(23 million dollars), blaming a decline in average fare prices.  The airline said it carried 32.7 million passengers in 
the three months ending on December 31, an 8-per-cent increase on the same period last year, while revenue 
increased by 9 per cent to 1.53 billion euros.  However the increases were offset by rises in fuel, staff and 
compensation costs.  'While a 20-million-euro loss in Q3 was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely 
due to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current 
and future traffic growth,' Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said.   Copyright dpa

Airlines will have 7 months to overhaul investor base in event of no-deal Brexit

Brussels is to give airline groups such as IAG, owner of British Airways and Iberia, a seven-month deadline to 
overhaul their shareholder make-up in order to retain full flying rights within the EU if Britain crashes out of the bloc 
without a deal next month.
The tight adjustment period for airlines, which must show they are majority owned and controlled by EU nationals to 
have full rights to fly through the continent, is outlined in revisions to a draft law seen by the Financial Times.
EU member states are broadly supporting the approach ahead of Britain's scheduled departure on March 29.
Aviation is a closely regulated sector that faces a double blow from Brexit, since an abrupt UK departure would 
disrupt not only flying schedules but the licences that carriers currently use to operate, which are administered 
based on the nationality of shareholders.
EU officials said the proposed sevenmonth grace period is coupled with exacting requirements and deadlines, that 
would force carriers such as IAG and Ryanair, which has a big number of UK shareholders, to potentially trigger 
forced share sales by non-EU investors.
Plans by airline groups to maintain existing licences must be presented to regulators within two weeks of the draft 
law being adopted, which could come later this month.
Airlines will have 7 months to overhaul investor base in event of no-deal Brexit
"That plan shall set out, in a complete and precise manner, the measures intended to achieve full compliance with 
the [EU] ownership and control requirements as from the 27 October 2019 at the latest," the draft states.
"Where the air carrier has not presented a plan within the [two-week] time limit, the competent licensing authority 
shall revoke the operating licence."
While Ryanair and Luton-based easyJet say they have contingency plans to ensure 50 per cent of shareholders are 
EU nationals, IAG has been reticent to explain its proposals. Some analysts put its current EU ownership as low as 
25 per cent.
IAG chairman Willie Walsh declined to comment on work it was doing with its Spanish airlines. IAG said the group 
was "confident" it would comply with EU ownership rules post-Brexit.

While Ryanair and easyJet say they have contingency plans in place to reach the 50 per cent threshold, potentially 
by using forced sales of shares, IAG has been reticent to explain its proposals to cope with a hard Brexit.
Independent estimates suggest IAG faces the biggest challenge of all, with some analysts putting its EU ownership 
as low as 25 per cent.
Brussels has warned IAG its favoured plan to continue flying freely around Europe would not comply with EU laws, 
according to senior officials.
At a press conference on Friday, the Financial Times asked IAG chairman Willie Walsh if he would like to comment 
on the work IAG was doing with its Spanish airlines to make them ready for Brexit. Mr Walsh replied: "No." He later 
added he expected the UK and EU to reach "a comprehensive agreement".
José Luis Ábalos, Spain's minister of public works, told parliament this week that Iberia and other airlines were 
"working intensively" to adjust their ownership and control structure to be ready for Brexit. He said the changes 
were "necessary" to "ensure the continued compliance" with European regulations and the retention of flying rights. 
The enforcement arrangements for the EU's airline ownership rules are part of a package of emergency laws that 
aim to keep basic transport services running if Britain leaves without a deal.
Spain, France, Finland and Poland led calls to offer far more generous arrangements for hauliers and airline 
groups, so levels of disruption were reduced in the aftermath of a hard Brexit. Spain particularly called for a more 
relaxed approach to enforcing ownership rules. Opinion page 7

Ryanair predicts challenging 2019 after Q3 loss

Ryanair expects soft yields to persist through the summer as low fuel prices allow struggling carriers to stay in 
business.
"We expect excess short-haul capacity to continue through 2019, which will we believe lead to a weaker – not 
stronger – fare environment," Ryanair stated.
Ryanair swung to an operating loss in the third quarter as higher fuel costs exposed flat sales at the Irish low-cost 
carrier.
New group chief executive officer Michael O'Leary called the loss "disappointing" but added that this was "entirely 
due to weaker than expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current 
and future traffic growth".
Excluding start-up costs for new carrier Laudamotion, Ryanair posted a &euro;6.5 million ($7.4 million) operating 
loss for the three months to 31 December, compared with a &euro;126 million profit in the prior-year period.
Through 2018 Ryanair's cash roughly halved to &euro;834 million, while in the nine months to 31 December 
operating cash flow fell to &euro;556 million from &euro;1 billion the year before.
From 31 March 2018 to 31 December Ryanair's net debt jumped from &euro;283 million to &euro;1.5 billion.
The airline describes the risk of a no-deal Brexit as "worryingly high", but adds that it will take steps to temporarily 
restrict the voting rights of non-EU shareholders "to ensure that Ryanair remains at all times an EU-owned and EU-
controlled airline, even if the UK exits the EU without a deal".

Southwest tops Fitch table
Southwest tops Fitch table

Southwest Airlines has climbed above Ryanair to receive Fitch Ratings' highest rating for an airline: A-.
Previously rated at BBB+ like Ryanair, Fitch upgraded Southwest due to strong free cash flow, low costs and low 
leverage.
Although Ryanair has a superior operating margin and liquidity balance, "Southwest compares well with Ryanair in 
that it has a lower level of gross leverage, longer track record of profitability, and larger base of unencumbered 
assets", Fitch states, adding: "Southwest also benefits from its customer-friendly reputation."
Fitch puts Southwest's adjusted debt to Ebitdar ratio at 2x and its free cash flow to fixed charge coverage at 4.5x.
It expects the low-cost carrier's free cash flow to decline to $1.5 billion in 2019. In January the airline reported 
record annual free cash flow.
It also notes that Southwest controls nearly a quarter of the US domestic market and highlights Southwest's "large 
base of unencumbered planes [that] allows for capacity to be reduced if demand were to decline as well as 
providing an alternate source of secured funding if needed".
Fitch now rates Southwest three notches above its closest US peers, and has an ex-fuel unit cost advantage over 
US network carriers of roughly 30%, Fitch says.

Ryanair is moving to a group structure "not dissimilar to that of IAG" as it restructures its various subsidiaries.
Under the new arrangement, to be implemented over the next 12 months, Ryanair DAC, Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun 
and Ryanair UK will each have their own chief executive officer (CEO), with Michael O'Leary serving as group CEO.
O'Leary's replacement as CEO of Ryanair DAC will be announced later this year.
In his new role as Group CEO, for which he has signed a five-year contract, O'Leary will focus on development of 
the group.
Meanwhile, David Bonderman and Kyran McLaughlin have agreed to lead the Ryanair board of directors for one 
more year until summer 2020, but neither of them want to be considered for re-election at the September 2020 
annual general meeting.   Stan McCarthy, who joined the board in May 2017, has agreed to become deputy 
chairman from April 2019, and will transition to chairman in summer 2020.

Norwegian announces $350m rights issue as losses buffet low-cost carrier

Norwegian Air Shuttle announced an emergency $350m rights issue yesterday as the lossmaking low-cost carrier 
said it was no longer in takeover talks.
The NKr3bn rights issue amounts to more than half the airline's equity value of NKr5.6bn, highlighting the problems 
it faces as it struggles to stay afloat.
Investors are worried by Norwegian's finances as it loses money after a rapid expansion on low-cost, long-haul 
flights. Buyers have been circling the group since last year as its transatlantic services put pressure on its finances.
The company's shares fell as much as 30 per cent to a six-year low but recovered to stand down 12 per cent as the 
airline said it would change from "growth to profitability" by divesting aircraft, postponing deliveries and continuing 
its NKr2bn cost-savings plan.
Norwegian said it was open to fresh takeover talks. IAG, the owner of British Airways, announced last week it would 
sell its stake in the Oslo-based carrier after failing to agree a deal. Shares fell more than 20 per cent after the news.
Norwegian said that a reinforced balance sheet would aid its "standalone financial strength", adding: "The board will 
nevertheless continue to be willing to engage in consolidation discussions that can develop shareholder value ."
The rights issue will be backed by its largest shareholders, including Bjorn Kjos, chief executive, and Bjorn Kise, 
chairman, and also by John Fredriksen, the shipping-to-oil rigs billionaire It announced preliminary results for 2018, 
Norwegian announces $350m rights issue as losses buffet low-cost carrier
with revenues increasing a third to NKr40.3bn but its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
dropping to a loss of NKr2.2bn, compared with a NKr59m profit a year earlier and a NKr3.1bn gain in 2016.
Mr Kjos was confident Norwegian could become profitable but admitted there would be "seasonal variations".
Norwegian, Europe's third-largest low-cost carrier behind Ryanair and easyJet, has aggressively expanded into 
long-haul travel.

"You've done too much, much too young," sang ska band The Specials. That message chimes with the story 
unfolding at low-cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle. Yesterday, it announced a NKr3bn ($352m) rights issue, nearly 
half the previous day's market value, to prevent a breach of debt covenants. This was the second since June. 
Expect cost cuts to follow after years of aggressive expansion. Like a tearaway adolescent, Norwegian has been 
grounded. And yet the market will not give up on the airline.
Perhaps because its model worked, for a while. Undercutting long-haul competition on fares, Norwegian grabbed 
market share and rattled rival airline bosses. Enough so that British Airways' owner International Airlines Group 
made a number of takeover attempts last year. But as losses mounted and equity markets wobbled, its appetite 
waned.
IAG's decision to walk away permanently from a deal last week suggests it worries that the experiment in European 
low-cost long-haul will soon end. Norwegian's largest loss to date, also announced yesterday, adds weight to this 
assertion.
Low-cost, short-haul carriers such as Ryanair compete by working their planes harder. They manage to get about 
11 "block hours" a day from their aircraft compared with roughly nine at legacy carriers, according to Bernstein.
The same model does not work on long-haul flights. Indeed, Norwegian's long-haul utilisation is similar to rivals 
such as British Airways.
Norwegian Air Shuttle: pressure drop Twitter : @FTLex
Shareholders' best hope remains a takeover. This explains the relatively small drop in the shares, 15 per cent on 
the day. The departure of IAG leaves no immediate buyer on the radar. The next test is whether the airline can 
repay its November 2019 bonds.
Someone thinks so. Its yield fell to 9 per cent on the day, from 30 per cent. Assuming the rights issue is successful, 
Norwegian will still be around. Sceptics should watch Norwegian's progress from the terminal.

IRISH budget airline Ryanair has acquired the remaining quarter of its Austrian unit Laudamotion for an undisclosed 
price, it said yesterday.
Europe's largest budget carrier previously owned a 75 per cent stake in Laudamotion. Former Formula One racing 
champion Niki Lauda, who last year bought back and re-branded the airline he founded, gave Ryanair the option to 
buy the whole carrier.
"Laudamotion is now a 100 per centowned subsidiary of Ryanair," Laudamotion said in a statement. It detailed 
plans to grow rapidly to 7.5mpassengers and 30 aircraft in 2021 from 4m passengers and 19 aircraft this year.
At a news conference at Vienna's main airport, Ryanair chief exec Michael O'Leary declined to disclose the price 
his company paid for Laudamotion. The deal for the last stake was completed on 31 December. Lauda will stay on 
as chairman of Laudamotion's board.

Norwegian Air tries to raise cash after warning on profits
Norwegian Air tries to raise cash after warning on profits

Body
COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - Norwegian Air Shuttle on Tuesday became the latest budget carrier to cut its 
earnings outlook amid tough competition and after British Airways' parent company, IAG, ruled out a bid for the 
loss-making company.
Norwegian's CEO, Bjoern Kjos, said the airline "has been through a period with significant growth" that left it with 
hefty losses and high debts. He said in a statement that the company needed more capital and was selling shares 
worth 3 billion kroner ($350 million).
The airline's problems echo those of rivals, with Ryanair - Europe's biggest airline by passengers - issuing recently 
its second profit warning in four months as tough competition pushed down fares over the winter. Other budget 
carriers, like Iceland's Wow, have needed financial rescues or takeovers.
According to preliminary figures, Norwegian Air is expected to report next month that its revenues last year were 
40.3 billion kroner ($4.7 billion), leading to an operating loss of approximately 3.8 billion ($ 446 million) kroner.
"Now we will concentrate on optimizing our international business and reducing costs," Kjos said.
To cut costs, the airline will sell aircraft, possibly establish a new holding company for parts of the aircraft fleet, and 
postpone aircraft deliveries. It aims to reduce costs by at least 2 billion kroner in 2019.
Kjos also said the cost reduction plans included compensation from British plane engine manufacturer Rolls Royce 
related to engine problems on the company's Dreamliner operation. Last year, the British company discovered 
problems with its Trent 1000 engines, which power Boeing's 787 Dreamliner aircraft.
Shares in Norwegian Air dropped some 25 percent in early trading in Oslo on Tuesday but later recovered 
somewhat to trade down 14 percent.

Irish budget carrier Ryanair has taken complete control over Laudamotion, the Austrian airline announced Tuesday.
Ryanair bought the remaining 25 per cent of the shares from the Niki Lauda Holding at the end of December, in 
addition to the 75 per cent it had previously held.
Despite the takeover, former Formula One champion Niki Lauda will retain a seat on Laudamotion's company 
board, chief executive Andreas Gruber told a press conference at Vienna International Airport.
Lauda, who also serves as non-executive chairman of the Mercedes Formula One team, originally founded the 
airline under the name Niki in 2003 and sold it to the Air Berlin group in 2011.
Following Air Berlin's bankruptcy, he bought it back last year and re-established it as Laudamotion, only to sell it 
quickly to Ryanair.
Laudamotion made a loss of about 140 million euros (160 million dollars) last year.
Gruber said he expects the loss to narrow to 50 million euros in 2019, and to start making profits next year.
Laudamotion, which mainly connects European airports, also announced plans Tuesday to double its fleet to 40 
aircraft until the 2021/2022 financial year.
Annual passenger numbers are to rise to 10 million by then, from 4 million last year.

       LONDON (dpa-AFX) - Ryanair Holdings Plc. (RYA.L, RYAAY) announced Tuesday that its 100% subsidiary 
Laudamotion GmbH, an Austrian low fares airline, has launched a series of exciting growth initiatives. 
  Ryanair, which completed the purchase of Laudamotion from NL Holdings in late December, said the initiatives 
includes increasing Lauda's fleet to 25 aircraft in summer '19. Lauda announced that it has signed LOI agreements 
with a number of lessors which will increase its Summer '20 fleet to 30 - all Airbus - aircraft, which will allow Lauda 
to grow its traffic from 4m guests in year 1 to 6m guests in year 2 to 7.5m guests in FY March 2021.  This summer, 
Laudamotion will operate 4 bases as it grows in Vienna from 4 to 8 aircraft, Dusseldorf 7 aircraft, Stuttgart 3 aircraft, 
and Palma 2 aircraft.  In winter 2019, the Vienna base will increase further to 11 aircraft, making Laudamotion 
Vienna's No.2 airline, just behind Austrian Airlines.  Laudamotion also announced details of up to 400 new jobs for 
pilots, cabin crew, and engineers across its 4 bases.   Laudamotion's CEO, Andreas Gruber, said, 'With the backing 
of Ryanair, Laudamotion is set to grow strongly over the next 3 years to carry 10m passengers p.a. We will release 
details of up to 20 new routes for winter 2019 once we have completed our airport and handling negotiations by the 
end of March.'

Irish carrier Ryanair has taken full control of Austrian subsidiary Laudamotion and outlined plans to increase the 
unit's fleet to 30 Airbus aircraft for summer 2020.
Ryanair in March 2018 agreed a plan to take a 75% stake in the Austrian carrier, shortly after the Niki Lauda-
controlled company had successfully bid for the assets of collapsed Air Berlin unit Niki.
The Irish carrier has today revealed that it completed the purchase of 100% of Laudamotion from NL Holdings in 
late December.
Laudamotion will carry around 4 million passengers across its first year of operations – the 12 months ending 31 
March 2019 – and Ryanair has today outlined plans to almost double this over the next two years.
The carrier operated a fleet of 19 aircraft during the summer of 2018 and will increase this to 25 for the coming 
summer. The airline has also signed letters of intent with lessors to increase its fleet to 30 aircraft for the summer of 
2020. In contrast to all-Boeing operator Ryanair, Laudamotion operates a fleet of Airbus narrowbodies and says all 
30 aircraft with be Airbus models.
Laudamotion projects carrying 6 million passengers in the coming year, reaching 7.5 million for the year ending 
March 2021.
"With the backing of Ryanair, Laudamotion is set to grow strongly over the next three years to carry 10 million 
passengers per annum," adds Laudamotion chief executive Andreas Gruber. "We will release details of up to 20 
new routes for winter 2019 once we have completed our airport and handling negotiations by the end of March."
Ryanair takes full control of Laudamotion Irish carrier Ryanair has taken full control of Austrian subsidiary 
Laudamotion E  and outlined plans to increase the ....
Laudamotion operates from four bases and will double the number of aircraft based at Vienna to eight this summer, 
making the Austrian airport its largest base. The airline will deploy seven and three aircraft respectively this summer 
at the German airports of Dusseldorf and Stuttgart, and two at Spanish resort Palma.
Laudamotion deputy chief executive Colin Casey says: "We are currently negotiating new routes and handling 
agreements with more than 50 new airports."
He notes the airline is also looking beyond Austria and Germany at a further base. "In winter 2019 we hope to 
announce at least one new base, which will be outside of Austria and Germany, and there are a number of new 
airports both in central and western Europe who are pitching to win this business."
Ryanair earlier this month said Laudamotion had generated a better-than-expected unit cost performance over the 
winter and has trimmed the division's full-year loss guidance by 7% to 140 million ($160 million).

BERLIN (AP) - Budget airline Ryanair has taken full control of Laudamotion, an Austrian-based carrier set up by 
former Formula 1 world champion Niki Lauda.
Laudamotion said Tuesday that Ryanair completed the purchase of 100 percent of the shares in the new airline in 
late December. It didn't give financial details. Ryanair had taken an initial 24.9 percent stake in March and later 
increased that to 75 percent.
The Austria Press Agency reported that Laudamotion CEO Andreas Gruber told a news conference at Vienna 
Airport that Lauda will continue to provide "input" to the airline after he sold his remaining stake.
Laudamotion said that it will now expand its fleet and recruit more pilots, cabin crew and engineers. It plans to open 
new routes from its bases in Vienna, Stuttgart, Duesseldorf and Palma.

Highlight: Brexit uncertainty, industrial disputes and overcapacity troubles have plagued the company, but is the 
situation as bad as it seems?
Body
Budget airline Ryanair announced a profit warning ealier this month, with chief executive Michael O’Leary blaming 
falling airfares. So, is the company grounded as an investment or can ir weather the turbulence and soar once 
more?
Prices had been expected to drop by 2% this winter but forecasts now show them plummeting by 7%. The company 
has also cut full year profits guidance by just under 10%, slashing the range from £970 million – £1.1 billion to £880 
million – £970 million.
Despite the gloomy figures, market analysts are broadly continuing to back the stock, albeit with some caveats.
Guinness European Equity Income fund investment analyst Nick Edwards remains cautiously optimistic about 
Ryanair’s future and says its future would look even better if Brexit collapsed.
‘I think Ryanair will come out alright in the end, but it’s hard to say if the underperformance is over for sure,' he said.
‘It’s a strong franchise, with high market shares. Overcapacity in European short-haul should continue to fall as 
smaller operators are squeezed out by tighter regulations and costs. No Brexit would be a plus.’
Ryanair is also exploiting other services used by travellers in a way their rivals are not, Edwards noted.
He said: ‘The 9x P/E multiple is still double the incumbents IAG and Lufthansa, but set against 25% sustainable 
return on equity that is nevertheless attractive.
‘Also the market isn’t really paying a lot of attention to the ancillary services growth at Ryanair (car hire, hotels) 
which is starting to grow quite nicely.’
Kames Capital European equities investment analyst Allan Clarke said that despite high profile disputes with 
employees, scheduling issues and tumbling fares, Ryanair can take advantage of the huge volume of passengers it 
can boast.
Can Ryanair soar high once again after its profit warning?
He argued: ‘The company’s issues with staff relations have been well publicised but deals with unions are 
progressing so we should be able to look beyond this shortly. 
‘The outlook for revenues is the main concern now, with high capacity in the European air travel market putting 
significant pressure on fares.
‘In the mid-term, this plays to Ryanair’s strengths: its key competitive advantages are on cost and sheer number of 
customers carried, meaning it can flex its muscle and put pressure on the weaker players in the market by being 
aggressive on fares.’
Investors can also look forward to Ryanair bolstering its market position as competitors fall by the wayside, Clarke 
predicted.
He said: ‘As others exit the market and capacity rationalises, I expect Ryanair to emerge in an even stronger 
competitive position from where it can work on improving the brand image and the company’s returns, making it 
look attractive at today’s valuation.’
However, the chief markets analyst at Markets.Com Neil Wilson said there will be turbulence ahead for Ryanair, as 
well as its competitors – in a time of considerable unpredictability.
Wilson said: ‘This is a problematic warning as it comes at a time of great uncertainty for the sector.
‘Ryanair delivered a profits warning that has rattled investors across the airline sector just as uncertainty over the 
outlook for carriers is at a high.
‘We note shares in Ryanair are starting to look rather cheap having declined by roughly half since August 2017, 
when the scheduling issues started.’
Wilson noted positives, such as better-than-expected traffic growth of 9% to 142 million, rising ancillary sales and 
better unit costs, but investors have been driven away by a ‘reassessment’ of the Ryanair model.
He said: ‘There is a mounting pressure on Ryanair's cost base as labour costs climb - we've seen the Mons 
ruling, union recognition and a series of cabin crew and pilot strikes.
‘This reassessment of Ryanair's low cost, high margin model has been at the heart of the reason why investors 
have steadily pulled out of the company. Today's lower guidance is a sign that a higher cost base makes it more 
problematic to maintain margins when overcapacity means lower fares.’
Nevertheless, Ryanair and other big low budget airline giants look set to gain from the sector-wide trend of mergers 
and acquisitions,  in Wilson’s view.
He said: ‘Even as demand pressures relent it is true that the sector as a whole is very adept at competing away any 
margin growth through lower fares.
‘On top of this we can add a good dose of Brexit uncertainty into the mix to suggest that this is a very uncertain 
period for airlines, albeit the largest carriers such as Ryanair, EasyJet and IAG are set to win out from sector-wide 
consolidation.’

Ryanair could acquire one or two smaller airlines like its separately branded Polish and Austrian units in the coming 
years, but "nothing big", Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Tuesday.
"You'll see in the next couple of years, I'd like to see Ryanair evolve as kind of a group of different airlines. We will 
have Ryanair based out of Ireland, you'll have Laudamotion based out of Austria, you'll have Ryanair Sun ... in 
Poland," he told a news conference.
"That will I think allow us in the next number of years to maybe add one or two other airlines. Now, nothing big but if 
there were some small-scale opportunities that popped up like the Laudamotion opportunity then we could do it," he 
said, adding that they would have to bring new bases in Europe. (Reuters)

Ireland-based carrier Ryanair said on Tuesday its cabin crew in Spain had voted in favour of a recognition 
agreement with SITCPLA and USO workers' unions.
Ryanair suffered a number of strikes last year by pilots and cabin crew, forcing it to cancel hundreds of flights 
across Europe, after the airline recognised unions for the first time in 2017.
The airline and the unions are working on a collective labour agreement which they both hope to conclude on or 
before April 30, Ryanair said in a statement.
Unions representing the cabin crew in Spain had called off plans to strike Jan. 10 and Jan. 13 after reaching a 
preliminary agreement on contracts earlier this month. (Reuters)

UK oil services stocks were under pressure after industry bellwether Halliburton gave a cautious first-quarter 
outlook, with Wood Group the day's sharpest blue-chip faller.
Exane BNP Paribas added to negative sentiment around Wood with a downgrade to "neutral". Debt reduction 
targets look challenging and accounting concerns need to be addressed, said the broker, which listed the treatment 
of exceptional costs, acquisition-related adjustments and lease liabilities as problem areas clouding the valuation.
Sector peer Hunting fell after Halliburton pointed to continued pricing pressure on fracking equipment.
EasyJet led an airline stock rally. Its first-quarter results matched forecasts once costs from drone disruption at 
Gatwick were ignored and came with unchanged guidance, in contrast to last week's profit warning from Ryanair.
Ocado gained after hosting an investor workshop to explain new reporting protocols. In the course of the meeting, 
management revealed "amazing" details on the fees charged for using its delivery warehouses, said Bernstein 
Research. The new data suggest earnings and cash flow forecasts "may be much too low in future years", it said.

easyJet Posts Double Digit Growth in First Quarter Sales; Sees Full Year 
Profit in-Line With Market Expectations

 British budget airline easyJet (EZJ.L) forecast a full-year headline profit before tax which would be "broadly in line" 
with market expectations early Monday as it posted double digit growth in revenue during the fiscal first quarter.
Total sales jumped by 13.7% to 1.30 billion pounds ($1.67 billion) during the three months that ended December 
31, the carrier said in a trading statement for the fiscal first quarter. Higher sales were led by passenger and 
ancillary revenue, which climbed by 12.2% and 19.9%, respectively. 
Passenger volumes in the quarter advanced by 15.1% to 21.6 million, driven by a lower-than-planned increase in 
capacity of 18.2% to 24.1 million seats. 
The airline operator, however, noted a decline in load factor by two percentage points to 89.7%, as anticipated, due 
to the one-off increase in prior-year late demand and the dilutive impact of Tegel flying, which also contributed to 
the 4.2% constant-currency drop in total revenue per seat and was "in line with expectations." easyJet purchased 
Air Berlin's insolvent operations at the Tegel Airport in Berlin in late 2017.
The negative impact also came from one-off benefits in the same period last year - Air Berlin and Monarch 
bankruptcies and Ryanair's (RYAAY, RYA.L) winter schedule cancellations due to industrial action that brought a 
windfall of 30 million pounds and 20 million pounds, respectively.
The carrier, which has taken a 15 million-pound hit from the drones fiasco at Gatwick Airport recently, reported a 
1% constant currency increase in headline cost per seat excluding fuel, which was in part due to better-than-
expected crew retention following the Ryanair debacle.
Looking ahead, easyJet said it was "well prepared for Brexit," with 130 aircraft registered in Austria. It said that it 
has made "good progress" in ensuring a spare-parts pool in the European Union and in transferring crew licenses, 
both of which will be completed by March 29, the day Britain is scheduled to exit the world's largest trading bloc.
easyJet Posts Double Digit Growth in First Quarter Sales; Sees Full Year Profit in-Line With Market 
Expectations
Unlike Ryanair, which announced a profit warning last week, easyJet said that "demand currently remains solid and 
forward bookings for the period after 29th March are robust." As a result, expectations for the year ending 
September 2019 are "broadly in line" with a Bloomberg consensus headline pre-tax profit estimate of about 580 
million pounds.

Highlight: Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has inaugurated the country's new Ramon International 
Airport near the Red Sea resort town of Eilat.
Body
The new airport will serve as an emergency alternative to Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport.Netanyahu was quoted by 
i24NEWS AFP as saying: "Israel is opening up to the world. No longer an isolated corner, it's becoming a hub in 
international terms."RamonÂ Airport is capable of managing up to two million passengers per annum and will have 
its capacity expanded so that it can to welcome 4.2 million travellers by 2030.It is equipped with a 3,600m-long 
runway and has apron parking space that can accommodate up to nine large and wide-body aircraft. 
The airport also features freight-handling services.The facility will initially handle only domestic flights operated by 
Israeli airlines Arkia and Israir. International airlines including Ryanair, Wizz Air, easyJet, SAS, Finnair and Ural will 
start offering services at a later date.A total of NIS1.7bn ($455m) has been invested in the development of the 
airport since construction started in 2013.The Israel Airports Authority (IAA) changed the original plans for the 
Ramon project during the 2014 Gaza war."In an emergency, not only will Israel's entire passenger air fleet be able 
to land and park there, but also additional aircraft," the IAA told the publication.A 26m-high, 4.5km-long 'smart' anti-
missile fence has reportedly been installed in and around the airport to protect flights landing and taking off from the 
Ramon Airport as the airport lies close to the border with Jordan.The new airport is named after Israel's first 
astronaut, Ilan Ramon.

Kingfisher was the FTSE 100's sharpest faller as fears about its French division led RBC to downgrade the DIY 
retailer.
Concerns about its products and online offering have led Kingfisher's Castorama chain to underperform the overall 
French market, RBC said. The broker also saw structural problems, arguing that while Castorama had more stores 
than main rival Leroy Merlin in high population areas, the latter's focus on lower-income neighbourhoods gave it 
greater exposure to faster growing populations.
Hammerson led real estate developers lower after JPMorgan Cazenove said retail property was facing a perfect 
storm of headwinds. The worsening newsflow from the UK over Christmas suggested buyers of shopping centres 
would increasingly incorporate expectations of falling rents into their forecasts, said JPMorgan. Its analysis found 
only three examples since 1987 when UK property stocks gained while capital values were falling.
Housebuilders Berkeley and Taylor Wimpey edged lower after Rightmove's January survey showed London asking 
prices falling to their weakest level in more than three years.
Rentokil slipped, with Goldman Sachs removing the stock from its "buy" list on valuation grounds. The pest control 
group "combines an attractive organic growth profile with significant potential to grow" via acquisitions, particularly 
to consolidate its position in North America and expand to emerging markets, Goldman said. But based on forward 
earnings Rentokil's valuation has touched a record high and the stock sits at a 100 per cent premium to the wider 
market, so better value can be found elsewhere, the broker argued.
London
BAE Systems gained after agreeing to sell a majority stake in its UK-based combat vehicles business to 
Rheinmetall of Germany.
Wizz Air and Ryanair both gained on the back of a positive note from Davy Stockbrokers, which argued that 
European airline stocks were too cheap given capacity growth was likely to slow and fuel costs had eased.
Dixons Carphone rose on a report that Elliott Advisors, the activist investor, was considering taking a stake.
RPC inched higher on expectations that Apollo Global Management would agree to buy the packaging maker as 
early as today. Apollo first admitted to takeover talks with RPC four months ago and has been widely reported to be 
raising finance for a deal. Bryce Elder

Jan 21, 2019( Watchlist News: http://www.watchlistnews.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Ryanair (NASDAQ:RYAAY) 
was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research[1] from a "hold" rating to a "buy" rating in a research report issued on 
Monday. The brokerage currently has a $76.00 price objective on the transportation company's stock. Zacks 
Investment Research[2]'s price objective would suggest a potential upside of 15.59% from the company's previous 
close. 
According to Zacks, "Ryanair is being aided by strong demand for air travel, especially due to low air fares. Notably, 
traffic in December rose 12% year over year. We are also impressed by Ryanair's efforts to reward shareholders in 
the form of share buybacks. In tune with this, the carrier returned more than €540 m to shareholders in the first six 
months of fiscal 2019. We remain positive on the collective deals signed by the company with German Pilot union. 
We expect strong traffic to aid its fiscal third-quarter results as well. Detailed results should be out on Feb 4. The 
Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 earnings increased 0.4% over the last 60 days. On the flip side, 
continued labor unrest is hurting Ryanair significantly. The stock has shed more than 45% of its value in a year's 
time mainly due to the labor unrest."RYAAY has been the subject of several other research reports. TheStreet cut

FTSE eyes 7,000 as pound dips ahead of Brexit ‘Plan B’
FTSE eyes 7,000 as pound dips ahead of Brexit ‘Plan B’

Highlight: FTSE 100 edges towards 7,000 mark, boosted by sterling weakness, as prime minister Theresa May 
prepares to issue Brexit ‘Plan B’ statement.
Body
The FTSE 100 has edged closer to the 7,000 mark, boosted by a fall in the pound ahead of prime minister Theresa 
May's announcement of  her Brexit ‘Plan B’ in parliament later today.
The blue-chip index rose 17 points, or 0.2%, to 6,985 as the pound dipped a quarter of a cent to $1.285 against the 
dollar.
A weaker pound tends to support the FTSE 100 as its stocks rely on overseas markets for around three-quarters of 
their earnings.
Weakness in the British currency comes as May prepares to issue an alternative Brexit deal to break the deadlock 
in parliament. May has had three days to prepare her ‘Plan B’ for the UK’s departure from the EU, after her initial 
deal was rejected by MPs last week.
Markets have strengthened on the expectation that the UK would not leave the EU without a deal.
‘How she will manage to get parliamentary consensus is completely unclear given that her proposal was rejected by 
402 out of 650 MPs last week and her subsequent attempt to find common ground with Labour didn’t yield any 
results,’ said Cityindex senior market analyst Fiona Cincotta.
‘EU politicians are not showing any more signs of willingness to cooperate than MPs and instead keep 
signalling that they are unwilling to agree to any more concessions for Britain.’
Easyjet (EZJ) was one of the biggest large-cap risers, with shares up 1.8% to £11.93, ahead of tomorrow's results.
Several analysts have upgraded their forecast on the airline, helping the shares to steady after rival Ryanair 
(RYA.I) issued a profit warning last week. The budget airline's contingency plans for no-deal Brexit are likely to be 
in focus.
On the FTSE 250, Just Eat (JE) fell 1.2% to 650p as Peter Plumb, chief executive of the takeaway ordering 
website, abruptly stepped down after just 16 months in the role.

Plumb had upgraded Just Eat’s technology, in a bid to keep pace with the likes of Deliveroo and Uber Eats, though 
increasing investment in the initiative caused earnings momentum to slow.
Just Eat also updated its earnings forecasts, with expected revenue of about £780 million in 2018 and underlying 
core earnings to range between £172 and £174 million, both ahead of analysts’ consensus forecasts.
Crude prices briefly rose to their highest point in 2019 so far after data showed refinery processing in China, the 
world’s second largest oil consumer, reaching a record high last year.
After climbing to $62.75 per barrel, Brent crude futures fell back to $62.49.
