 TOTAL VOTING RIGHTS
 In conformity with Regulation 20 of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109 EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended), 
Ryanair announces that as at 28 February 2019:
 Ryanair's issued share capital consists of 1,133,395,322 Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each with 
voting rights. Ryanair does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury.  Therefore, the total number of voting rights in 
Ryanair is 1,133,395,322.
 The above figure may be used by shareholders as a denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if 
they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, Ryanair under the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended) and the Interim Transparency Rules of the Central Bank.

 Your Company's relatively poor short-term performance could be explained by having almost no exposure to 
strongly performing sectors such as telecommunications, oil and gas, and utilities. A better explanation is that some 
of the holdings suffered sharp price declines, declines which, in our opinion, do not reflect the strong fundamentals 
of the companies concerned. Many of the worst performers in the six months are companies which had in previous 
reporting periods been the best performing. In most cases the business models remain strong; the price declines 
are more due to short term valuation considerations. This being the case we have retained and, in some cases, 
increased holdings. 
The greatest detractor to the portfolio's performance was Grenke, the German leasing business. It continues to 
deliver high growth and strong results. It has proved to be a more agile and responsive partner than the banks to 
corporate customers; for this reason we believe that it will continue to succeed. BioMerieux, a global leader in vitro 
diagnostics, was another poor performer. It has enjoyed a strong position in syndromic testing where it has been 
hitherto almost unchallenged. But new competitors and a less benign pricing environment in the US are a source of 
concern. Notwithstanding these concerns we retain confidence in this investment. Ryanair, too, performed poorly. In 
accepting unionisation, Ryanair has become more like other airlines. The authorities continue to pursue Ryanair for 
what they believe are anti-competitive practices. Ryanair's distinctive advantages are being eroded. Accordingly, 
we sold our holding. Though not one of the largest positions in the portfolio, Bayer's shares' very poor performance 
markedly impacted the portfolio. The company suffered an adverse decision in a Californian court concerning the 
use of Roundup, Bayer's glyphosate-based herbicide. This decision seems to have been less about the science 
and more about negative sentiment towards Monsanto, the company acquired by Bayer and the owner of the 
Roundup brand. This represents a considerable liability. Other parts of Bayer's businesses have not been 
performing well. We acknowledge that this has been a costly investment mistake. Nevertheless, we have decided to 
retain our holding in Bayer believing that eventually merging Bayer and Monsanto's agri-technology businesses will 
create a highly profitable global leader. Finally, we note the underperformance of Amadeus, a major Spanish IT 
provider for the global travel and tourism industry. For many years the airlines have tried and failed to 
disintermediate the GDS (Amadeus' principal offering). Where the airlines have succeeded in so doing, Amadeus' 
Jupiter European Opps. Trust PLC Half-year Report -2-
technical services are needed to provide alternative solutions. We think that the airlines will continue to need 
Amadeus' services and that demand for these services should increase.
 The list of 'winners' is diverse. In all cases we seek to invest in companies with sustainable and advantageous 
points of differentiation. When this proves to be correct and the companies deliver superior results the shares 
should outperform. The largest single contributor to performance was Marine Harvest (now named Mowi). As the 
world's largest salmon farmer it benefits from a growing demand for healthy eating. Its vertically integrated business 
(producing fish feed, processing and selling value added products) marks it out from competitors. Novo Nordisk, 
another significant contributor to performance, benefits from the problems of unhealthy eating. Commoditisation of 
insulins and concomitant pricing pressures represent serious threats to the company's prospects. But the new class 
of drug, GLP-1 agonists, offers scope for greater therapeutic success and differentiation. Moreover, diabetes and its 
comorbidities, obesity and cardiovascular damage, are on the rise across the world. The 'target market' is 
increasing at around 6% annually. RELX, a world-leading provider of information and analytics for professional and 
business customers, was another major contributor to the portfolio. In this age of 'big data' and more regulations 
RELX is well placed. It is a 'winner' from digital trends. RELX has some unique data sets; it has built advantages 
into its business model which competitors struggle to match; and it is well embedded with customers. This is not 
necessarily the case with digital 'plays' where the technology can lower barriers to entry and reduce scope for 
differentiation. The other notable contributor in the period under review is Edenred, a French company specialised 
in prepaid corporate services including luncheon vouchers (its historic business), other corporate benefits and 
expense management. It, too, is a beneficiary from 'digital'. It allows the company to extend the range of its offering; 
it can reach more customers and does so in a way that is more convenient for customers and users alike. Our 
largest investment, Wirecard, reported excellent results for 2018. However, after the end of the period under review, 
the share price fell significantly following a journalist alleging serious wrong doing by the company. Wirecard deny 
the allegations. We have never had cause to doubt the company. Until and unless there are substantive and 
substantiated charges we remain confident that the company is strong and well placed to prosper.
 There were two sales of significant, long standing positions: Fresenius SE and Ryanair (as explained above). The 
former was sold as we anticipated greater political interference in their German hospitals business and sensed new 
challenges to operating their dialysis clinics in the US. We also sold shares in Wartsila, the Finnish manufacturer of 
engines for power plants and ships. This company is well placed to benefit from trends such as ship automation, 
tighter maritime environmental legislation and increasing demand for distributed power. However, demand for 
Wartsila's products and services has not developed as we expected.
 New purchases included shares in companies that we have followed for many years and in some cases have been 
previously owned by your Company. Principal amongst these is Hexagon, a global leader in digital solutions that 
create autonomous connected ecosystems (ACE) across manufacturing, infrastructure, safety and mobility. It is 
flourishing in the Chinese market. It is a beneficiary of the move to 'smart' factories and manufacturing. We also 
purchased shares in the London Stock Exchange Group, a diversified financial markets infrastructure company. It 
continues to benefit as the market (prompted by the regulator) moves away from OTC (over the counter) trading to 
'exchange traded'. Critically, we do not see its major activities as being directly threatened by BREXIT. Another 
purchase was that of shares in Barry Callebaut, one of the world's largest cocoa producers and grinders. The 
greater demands coming from customers for traceability and quality is squeezing out some of the smaller 
competitors, notably Asian grinders. This should improve the operating environment for Barry Callebaut. We also 
bought shares in Wolters Kluwer, the Dutch global information services company. Digital and cloud technologies 
should strengthen their position and allow them to increase the scale of their activities. Finally, we bought more 
shares in Intermediate Capital Group, the UK listed private debt and equity asset manager. Its business is well 
placed to grow. First, its niche, specialist positioning in private debt and equity is increasingly attracting mainstream 
clients; and second, the privately owned sector has advantages over the publicly listed sector. This is apparent to 
corporates and individuals alike. As a result, there is a flow of resources into the private equity space which 
underpins ICG's prospects.
 Outlook
 The more difficult investment conditions are not unexpected. Our positioning for this development has not changed 
the portfolio. We endeavour to invest in companies that can flourish in a range of market conditions. Indeed, more 
difficult economic conditions will doubtless throw up opportunities for strong companies. The test is whether 
Jupiter European Opps. Trust PLC Half-year Report -2-
companies can strengthen through the cycle. There are serious challenges that go beyond the normal cyclical ones. 
The publicly quoted companies are assailed by insidious challenges to capitalism which subvert the proper purpose 
of business. It probably explains why capital and 'talent' is flowing from public to private equity. Good governance 
where directors act in the best interests of the company as distinct from acting to satisfy outside parties is vital to 
our investment process. Protectionism in its many forms (including 'localism', increasing regulations and 
government interference) leads to distortions in incentives and resource allocation. Yet for all these challenges, 
there are undoubtedly companies that have the skills and agility to respond to changing demand. Companies that 
develop new technologies, or can harness such technologies, to shape new business models which effectively 
serve customer needs, will prosper. There are still good rewards for companies that innovate to meet customer 
needs; have the flexibility and mindset to embrace change; and work hard to stay ahead. Our process for 
uncovering and understanding such opportunities has not changed. We believe that our investment process is still 
appropriate for current conditions thereby sustaining our confidence for the future.

 RYANAIR BELGIAN PILOTS VOTE (98%) FOR COLLECTIVE LABOUR AGREEMENT
 Ryanair today (20 Feb) confirmed that its directly employed Pilots based in Belgium have voted by a majority of 
98% in favour of a CLA (collective labour agreement) governing pay and conditions for the next 4 years. The

taker to exercise the voting rights at his discretion;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (g) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that controls the voting rights;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to 
the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 
2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest 
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of 
the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
 (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
 (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the Regulations 
and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding only that the 
holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.
 (ix) In case of combined holdings of shares with voting rights attached "direct holding" and voting 
rights "indirect holding", please split the voting rights number and percentage into the direct and 
indirect columns - if there is no combined holdings, please leave the relevant box blank.
 (x) Date of maturity/expiration of the financial instrument i.e. the date when right to acquire shares 
ends.
 (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every 
3 months starting from [date].
 (xii) In case of cash settled instruments the number and percentages of voting rights is to be presented 
on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Holding(s) in Company -2-
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

 RYANAIR HOLDINGS ISSUES SHARE OPTIONS TO DIRECTORS
 Ryanair Holdings Plc today (Fri, 8 Feb) confirmed that it had issued Share Options to its Directors, during the 
current open period, granting each Director options over shares at a strike price of EUR11.12.
 Ryanair's Executive Director Michael O'Leary has been granted options over 10m shares at this strike price. The 
terms of the options will require him to double Ryanair's profitability to EUR2bn p.a. and/or increase the share price 
to EUR21 per share over the next 5 years to qualify for all of these options. He will then be required to pay the full 
option price of EUR11.12 to take up these options.
 Each of the 11 non-Executive Directors have also been granted options over 50,000 shares each at a strike price 
of EUR11.12. Again, the Company will have to double its profitability to EUR2bn p.a. and/or increase the share 
price to over EUR21 per Ordinary Share for the non-Exec Directors to qualify for all of these Share Options, which 
they will be required to pay the full option price of EUR11.12 per share to take up these options.
 Note: The closing price of Ryanair Holdings Plc Ordinary Shares on Thurs 7 Feb was EUR11.12 per share.
 Ends.

 RYANAIR REPORTS Q3 LOSS OF EUR20M (EXCL LAUDA)
 LOWER FARES LEADS TO STRONGER GROWTH AS COMPETITORS FAIL
 Ryanair today (4 Feb.) reported a Q3 net loss of EUR20m (excl. Lauda). Strong traffic growth (+8%) to 33m was 
offset by a 6% decline in ave. fares due to excess winter capacity in Europe. Stronger ancillary revenue growth 
(+26%) was offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs.

 --------------  --------------  ---------
* excl. EUR46.5m exceptional Q3 FY19 Lauda loss
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "While a EUR20m loss in Q3 was disappointing, we take comfort that this was entirely due to weaker than 
expected air fares so our customers are enjoying record low prices, which is good for current and future 
traffic growth. While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 26% in Q3, this was offset by higher fuel, 
staff and EU261 costs.
 Q3 highlights include:
 --    Traffic grew 8% to 33m (LF unchanged at 96%)
 --    Ave. fares fell 6% to under EUR30
 --    Ancillary revenue rose 26% to EUR557m
 --    More union progress - 20 Jan. Spanish Cabin Crew agreement
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
 --    Lauda holding increased to 100%
 --    UK AOC granted in Dec.
 Revenue
 Q3 revenue increased 9% to EUR1.53bn, up 1% per guest, due to a strong performance in ancillary revenue 
and increased traffic stimulated by a 6% decline in average fares to under EUR30 due to excess short-haul 
capacity in Europe.  Ryanair Labs continues to drive ancillary revenue.  In Q3 priority boarding and 
reserved seating grew strongly.  A transformational improvement of our digital platform is underway 
(website, app & 3(rd) party ancillary plug-ins) and will be completed before year-end.  This will further 
improve personalisation, and triple capacity, as we grow to 200m guests p.a. and welcome over 1bn platform 
visits each year.
 Cost Leadership
 Ryanair has the lowest unit costs of any EU airline and this gap is widening.  We will take delivery of 
our first 5x B737 MAX "gamechanger" aircraft from April.  These aircraft have 4% more seats, are 16% more 
fuel efficient, have 40% lower noise emissions and are hedged at an average EUR/$ rate of $1.24 out to 
FY24. They will drive unit cost efficiencies over the next 5 years.  As consolidation continues and weaker 
European airlines fail (or sell), airports are increasingly keen to attract Ryanair's dependable, 
efficient (high load factor) traffic growth.  FY19 is a year of investment in our people, our systems and 
our business as we prepare to grow to 200m guests p.a. by 2024.  In Q3 ex-fuel unit costs increased by 6%.  
This includes higher staff costs, including the 20% pilot pay increases, investment in engineering 
headcount, pilot/cabin crew training, and elevated EU261 costs due to the high number of ATC staff 
shortages/disruptions in FY19.  We have extended our fuel hedges and are 90% hedged for FY20 at c.$71bbl 
and 13% hedged for Q1 FY21 at c.$63bbl.
 Balance Sheet
 The Group's balance sheet (BBB+ rated) remains one of the strongest in the industry with EUR2.2bn gross 
cash and 93% of our fleet owned - 60% of which is unencumbered.  In the first 9 months of FY19 Ryanair 
generated almost EUR560m net cash from operations, spent EUR1.2bn on capex (primarily aircraft, 
simulators, engines, hangars and spare parts), returned EUR560m to shareholders via share buybacks, and 
repaid over EUR230m debt.  As a result, net debt increased to EUR1.5bn at quarter end.
 Lauda
 In December, Ryanair acquired the remaining 25% of Laudamotion. This Austrian airline will carry just 
over 4m customers in its first (start up) year, but was heavily loss making, mainly due to the very late 
release of S.18 schedules, low promotional fares, expensive aircraft leases and unhedged fuel. Due to 
recent improvements in schedules, fares and costs, the exceptional year 1 start-up loss has been reduced 
from an expected EUR150m to approx. EUR140m. Lauda is now gearing up for its second year with an increased 
fleet of 25 aircraft (from 19 in prior year), traffic growth to 6m guests, lower cost fuel hedges, and we 
expect losses to narrow substantially to between EUR50m and breakeven depending on S.19 peak season 
yields. By year 3 Lauda is on track to grow to over 7.5m customers and profitability.
 Competition & Consolidation
 Higher oil prices and lower fares have over the past 4 months seen a wave of EU airline failures 
including Primera (UK & Spain), Small Planet and Azur (Ger), Sky Works (Swi), VLM (Bel), Cobalt (Cyprus) 
and Cello (UK). In addition, other bigger airlines like Wow (Ice), Flybe (UK), and Germania (Ger) are 
urgently seeking buyers or, like Norwegian, refinancing just to survive.
 Other airlines have also cut or closed bases in response to lower fares and higher fuel costs. Ryanair 
closed unprofitable bases in Bremen & Eindhoven and we cut aircraft numbers in Niederrhein and Hahn. 
Norwegian have closed multiple bases, many where they compete with Ryanair, including Rome, Las Palmas, 
Palma, Tenerife, Edinburgh & Belfast, and will cut their Dublin base from 6 to 1 aircraft in October. Wizz 
(Poznan), Lufthansa (Dusseldorf) and EasyJet (Oporto) have also announced base cuts and/or closures in 
recent months. We expect more closures and airline failures in 2019 due to over capacity in the European 
market, which is causing continued fare weakness.
 Brexit
 The risk of a "no deal" Brexit remains worryingly high. While we hope that common sense will prevail, and 
lead to either a delay in Brexit, or agreement on the 21 month transition deal currently on the table, we 
have taken all necessary steps to protect Ryanair's business in a no-deal environment. We have now 
obtained a UK AOC to protect our 3 domestic UK routes, and we will place restrictions on the voting rights 
and share sales of non-EU shareholders for a period of time (in the event of a hard Brexit) to ensure that 
Ryanair remains at all times an EU owned and EU controlled airline, even if the UK exits the EU without a 
deal.
 Guidance (excl. Lauda)
 As announced on 18 Jan., Ryanair's FY19 profit guidance will be in a range of EUR1.0bn to EUR1.1bn due 
to:
 --    Lower winter fares, which are expected to fall 7% (H2) (compared to -2% originally forecast);
 --    Stronger traffic growth, up 9% to 142m;
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
 --    Stronger ancillary sales as more customers choose lower cost optional services; and
 --    Slightly better than expected H2 unit cost performance, mainly lower unhedged oil prices.
 This guidance excludes (exceptional) start-up losses in Lauda, which have been cut from EUR150m to 
EUR140m primarily on the back of better than expected unit cost performance during the winter period.
 While we have reasonable visibility of our Q4 bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air fares 
and/or slightly lower full year guidance especially if there are unexpected Brexit and/or security 
developments which adversely impact fares for close-in bookings between now and the end of March.
 We do not share the recent optimistic outlook of some competitors that Summer 2019 airfares will rise. In 
the absence of further EU airline failures, and because of the recent fall in oil prices (which allows 
loss making unhedged competitors to survive longer), we expect excess short haul capacity to continue 
through 2019, which will we believe lead to a weaker - not stronger - fare environment. Ryanair will 
continue to be load factor active / price passive in this market, which we expect will lead to lower fares 
for our customers, robust traffic growth and more casualties among already loss making competitors before 
the year end."
 Group Structure
 Over the next 12 months Ryanair Holdings Plc will move to a group structure not dissimilar to that of 
IAG. A small senior management team will oversee the development of 4 airline subsidiaries; Ryanair DAC, 
Laudamotion, Ryanair Sun and Ryanair UK, each with their own CEOs and management teams. Holdings will 
focus upon efficient capital allocation, cost reductions, aircraft acquisitions and small scale M&A 
opportunities.
 To lead this group structure Michael O'Leary will become Group CEO, a role in which he will concentrate 
on the development of the group. A replacement CEO of Ryanair DAC, who will work alongside the CEOs of 
Laudamotion and Ryanair Sun, will be appointed later this year. The Group CEO will be assisted in Holdings 
by small group legal and group finance teams. As we expand the Lauda Airbus fleet and take delivery of 
over 200 B737 Max aircraft, we believe this group structure will deliver cost and operating efficiencies, 
while enabling the group to look at other small scale M&A opportunities like the successful development of 
Lauda.
 Board Succession
 Having agreed this group strategy as the best way to grow Ryanair, Sun, Lauda and other possible airline 
brands, Michael O'Leary has agreed a new 5 year contract as Group CEO, which secures his services for the 
group until at least July 2024. His agreement to commit for a 5 year period is welcome, and will give 
certainty to our shareholders and allow him to guide the individual CEO's of Ryanair, Laudamotion and 
Ryanair Sun.

Exceptional item: The Group presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size 
and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents 
the underlying business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the 
results. Any amounts deemed exceptional for MD&A purposes have been classified for the purposes of the 
income statement in the same way as non-exceptional amounts of the same nature.
 The exceptional item in the nine months ended December 31, 2018 relates to the exceptional start-up 
losses of Lauda, which became a subsidiary of Ryanair at the start of August 2018.
 Going concern
 Having considered the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial position and cash 
flows, the Directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the interim financial statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of 
the interim financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the interim financial statements.
 Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2018 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2018, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2018, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
 The December 31, 2018 figures and the December 31, 2017 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2018, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2018 on February 1, 2019.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance with 
the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial statements, 
which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with IFRS as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 Accounting for Investment in associates
 An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence.  Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the entity, but is not control over these 
policies. The Company's investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method.  The 
consolidated income statement reflects the Company's share of profit/losses after tax of the associate.  
Investments in associates are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost adjusted for post-
acquisition changes in the Company's share of net assets, less any impairment in value.  If necessary, any 
impairment losses on the carrying amount of the investment in the associate are reported within the 
Company's share of equity accounted investments results in the consolidated income statement.  If the 
Company's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred 
obligations in respect of the associate.
 Accounting for business combinations
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the date that control is 
transferred to the Group. Under the acquisition method, consideration transferred is measured at fair 
value on the acquisition date, as are the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 When the initial values of assets and liabilities in a business combination have been determined 
provisionally, any subsequent adjustments to the values allocated to the identifiable assets and 
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) are made within twelve months of the acquisition date and 
presented as adjustments to the original acquisition accounting.  Acquisition related costs are expensed 
in the period incurred.
 Accounting for subsidiaries
 Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to 
(has rights to) variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity.
 The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the Group Income 
Statement from the date at which control of the entity was obtained. They continue to be included in the 
Group Income Statement until control ceases.
 Newly effective EU-endorsed standards and amendments
 The following new and amended standards, have been issued by the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the 
EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after January 
1, 2018 and therefore have been applied by the Group for the first time in these condensed consolidated 
interim financial statements;
 --    IFRS 15: "Revenue from Contracts with Customers including Amendments to IFRS 15" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018) (see below)

2018) (see below)

or after January 1, 2018)
 New standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes of 
the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. A more detailed transitional impact for 
IFRS 16 is included below.  While under review, we do not anticipate that the adoption of the other new or 
revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position or results 
from operations:
 --    IFRS 16: "Leases" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019) (see below)
 --    IFRIC 23: "Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2019)
 --    Amendments to IFRS 9: "Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation" (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019) (see below)
 --    Amendments to IAS 28: "Long-term interests in Associates and Joint Ventures" (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019)
 --    Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2019)
 --    Amendments to IAS 19: "Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement" (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2019)
 --    Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
 IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 have been adopted in the financial year ended March 31, 2019. Changes to significant 
accounting policies, together with the impact of adoption, are described below:
 IFRS 15:  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 The Group has adopted IFRS 15 with effect from April 1, 2018. The standard establishes a five-step model 
to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount.  Revenue is recognised when the good or service 
has been transferred to the customer and at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled.

Body
 The Board had previously committed to setting out its succession plan before the Sept. 2019 AGM. In that regard, 
David Bonderman (Chairman) and Kyran McLaughlin (SID) have agreed to lead the Board for 1 more year until 
summer 2020, but neither of them wishes to go forward or be considered for re-election at the September 2020 
AGM. In order to ensure a smooth succession, Stan McCarthy who joined the Board in May 2017, has agreed to 
take up the position of Deputy Chairman from April 2019, and will transition to Chairman of the Board in summer 
2020. Stan will bring his enormous international experience (as a former CEO of Kerry Group Plc) and leadership 
skills to the development of Ryanair Holdings over the coming years, although a legend like David Bonderman will 
be a very hard act to follow.

 Introduction
 For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance sheet 
commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the exceptional 
item referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the nine months under IFRS to the adjusted results is 
provided on page 14 and in note 8 of this interim financial report.
 The exceptional item in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 comprised Lauda's exceptional start-up losses of 
EUR46.5M. Lauda became a subsidiary at the start of August 2018.
 MD&A Quarter Ended December 31, 2018
 Income Statement
 Scheduled revenues:
 Scheduled revenues increased by 1% to EUR975.0M due to 8% traffic growth (to 32.7M) offset by a 6% reduction 
in average fares to under EUR30.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues rose by 26% to EUR557.0M due to 8% traffic growth, improved uptake of ancillary products, 
particularly reserved seating and priority boarding services.
 Total revenues:
 As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 9% to EUR1,532.0M (up over 1% per guest).
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil rose by 32% to EUR571.7M due to higher fuel prices and a 9% increase in block hours.
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges increased by 8% to EUR241.1M, in line with traffic growth, due to an 8% increase in 
sectors.
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs increased 31% to EUR237.2M due to 20% pilot pay increases, 9% more flight hours, recruitment of 
additional engineers, investment in pilot & cabin crew training and a 3% pay increase for non-flight-staff awarded in 
April 2018.
 Route charges:
 Route charges rose by 6% to EUR172.5M due to the 8% increase in sectors offset by a decrease in unit rates.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation is 14% higher at EUR159.3M broadly in line with the 50 (+13%) additional owned aircraft in the fleet 
at period end (Q3 FY 19: 429 / Q3 FY 18: 379).
 Marketing, distribution and other:
 Marketing, distribution and other rose by 28% to EUR104.4M primarily due to higher EU261 costs arising from 
flight disruptions and cancellations.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 1% to EUR36.5M, broadly in line with last year.  A higher number 
of maintenance shop visits for older aircraft was offset by fewer lease handbacks in the quarter.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals fell by 24% to EUR15.8M due to the smaller leased fleet. (Q3 FY 19: 27 / Q3 FY 18: 33)
 Unit costs rose by 12% (excluding fuel they increased by 6%).
 Net finance expense:
 Net finance expense increased by 4% to EUR14.2M due to the higher net debt in the quarter.
 MD&A Nine Months Ended December 31, 2018

 Scheduled revenues increased by 2% to EUR4,479.9M due to 7% traffic growth (to 109.3M) offset by a 4% 
reduction in average fares to EUR41.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues rose by 27% to EUR1,841.8M due to 7% traffic growth, improved uptake of ancillary products, 
particularly reserved seating and priority boarding services and the positive timing of revenue recognition on certain 
fees (approx. EUR110M) following the transition to IFRS 15.
 Total revenues:
 As a result of the above, total revenues increased by 8% to EUR6,321.7M (up 2% per guest).

April 2018.
 Route charges:
 Route charges rose by 4% to EUR576.5M due to the 7% increase in sectors offset by a decrease in unit rates.

at period end (FY 19: 429 / FY 18: 379).
 Marketing, distribution and other:

from disruptions and cancellations during the period.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 24% to EUR131.7M due to higher scheduled engine maintenance 
arising from the higher number of shop visits for older aircraft and the timing of lease handbacks.
 Aircraft rentals:

 10.          Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the nine months ended December 31, 2018 amounted to EUR1,183.5M and primarily 
relates to aircraft pre delivery payments, 29 aircraft deliveries, spare engines, maintenance hangar 
construction costs and simulators.
 11.          Business combinations
 Acquisition of a Subsidiary
 In April 2018, the Company purchased a 24.9% stake in Lauda. This investment was accounted for using the 
equity method. In August 2018, the Group acquired a further 50.1% of the shares and voting interests in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -8-
Lauda. The Group has since increased is holding in Lauda to 100%. Lauda gives the Group access to valuable 
slots at slot constrained airports in Germany, Austria & Palma in Spain.
 In the period to December 31, 2018, Lauda contributed revenue of EUR97.7M and an operating loss of 
EUR108.3M to the Group's results. Ryanair also recognised EUR9.8M in share of losses in associate prior to 
consolidation of Lauda, and recognised a deferred tax credit of EUR26.7M relating to the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset re Lauda losses.
 Consideration transferred and assets and liabilities assumed
 The following table summarises the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of 
acquisition of control and the consideration transferred to acquire control of Lauda:
EURM
 Consideration:
 - Consideration (liabilities & cash paid)        32
 - Fair value of existing equity interest          6
 - Elimination of intercompany loans              61
 -------
 Total                                             99
 -------
Net assets acquired:
 - Intangible assets                             100
 - Cash and cash equivalents                       7
 - Net other assets (liabilities) acquired       (8)
 -------
 Total                                             99
 -------
Fair values measured on a provisional basis
 Given the proximity of the acquisition to the period end, the fair value of Lauda's intangible assets 
(principally landing slots) has been determined on a provisional basis.
 Goodwill
 As the value of identifiable net assets acquired substantially equalled the value of the consideration 
paid plus the fair value of the existing interest in Lauda, there was a nil value attributed to Goodwill.  
The re-measurement to fair value of the Group's initial 24.9% interest in Lauda, from its pre acquisition 
carrying value of nil, resulted in a gain of EUR6M.  This amount has been included in share of associate 
losses in the condensed interim income statement.
 12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2018 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --          Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --          Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for that 
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --          Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --          Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --          Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at December 31, 2018 has been used 
to establish fair value. (Level 2)
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -8-
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the nine months ended December 31, 
2018, there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair 
value hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments not measured at fair value
 --          Long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at the 
relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at December 31, 2018 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the nine months ended 
December 31, 2018 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

Body
 The impact of initially applying the standard is mainly attributed to certain ancillary revenue streams 
where the recognition of revenue is deferred under IFRS 15 to the flight date where it was previously 
recognised on the date of booking.  For the majority of our revenue, the manner in which we previously 
recognised revenue is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 15.  The change in the timing of ancillary 
revenue recognition means that an increased amount of revenue will be recognised in the first half of the 
year under IFRS 15, with less revenue recognised in the second half of the year, particularly in Quarter 
4.
 The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients), with the 
effect of initially applying this standard recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. April 1, 
2018). Accordingly, the comparatives have not been restated - i.e. they are presented, as previously 
reported, under IAS 18 and related interpretations.  The impact on transition to IFRS 15, was a reduction 
in retained earnings (net of tax) of EUR285.0M at April 1, 2018.
 The impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the Group's interim balance sheet as at December 31, 2018 was an 
increase in the amount of deferred revenue of EUR175M, compared with the amount that would have been 
recognised under IAS 18 and related interpretations. The impact on the interim income statement and the 
interim statement of comprehensive income is to increase ancillary revenue in the nine months ended 
December 31, 2018 by EUR110M.
 There is a nil net impact on the Group's interim statement of cash flows for the nine months ended 
December 31, 2018.
 IFRS 9:  Financial Instruments
 The Group has adopted IFRS 9 with effect from April 1, 2018.  The standard introduces a new model for the 
classification and measurement of financial assets, a new impairment model based on expected credit losses 
and a new hedge accounting model to more closely align hedge accounting with risk management strategy and 
objectives. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
 Financial assets, excluding derivatives, are accounted for at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss depending on the nature of the contractual cash 
flows of the asset and the business model in which it is held. All of Ryanair's financial assets continue 
to be held at amortised cost. Accordingly, no transition adjustment to carrying values arose in the nine 
months ended December 31, 2018. Neither was there a material increase in provisions as a result of 
applying the new expected loss impairment model to our financial assets and our hedge accounting 
provisions did not materially change as a result of adoption of IFRS 9 in the nine months ended December 
31, 2018.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -7-
 IFRS 16:  Leases
 IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
 The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption is 
permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of 
initial application of IFRS 16.  Ryanair does not intend to early adopt IFRS 16.
 We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures but do not expect the impact to be material.
 2.            Judgements and estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine months ended December 
31, 2018 was 8.1% (December 31, 2017: 10.3%).  The tax charge for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 
of EUR95.3M (December 31, 2017: EUR160.5M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR132.4M, a deferred tax 
credit of EUR10.4M relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in 
the income statement and a deferred tax credit of EUR26.7M relating to Lauda losses.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR7.5M (December 31, 2017: EUR4.5M) is the fair value of 
various share options granted in current and prior periods, which are being recognised within the income 
statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions,

the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive

legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.

 Vienna, 29th January 2019
 Laudamotion announces Ryanair acquires 100% shareholding
 Lauda commits to 24 aircraft in S19 & signs LOI to grow to 30 aircraft in S20
 Lauda traffic to grow from 4m in year 1 to 6m in year 2
 Laudamotion, Austria's No. 1 low fares airline, today (29 Jan) confirmed that Ryanair has completed the 
purchase of 100% shareholding in Laudamotion GmbH from NL Holdings in late December. Laudamotion now 
becomes a 100% subsidiary of Ryanair Holdings Plc, the Group which owns Europe's largest airline.
 With the support of Ryanair Holdings, Laudamotion today announces a series of exciting growth 
initiatives, which includes:
 --     Increasing Lauda's fleet to 25 aircraft in summer '19 (from 19 in S2018). Lauda today announces 
that it has signed LOI agreements with a number of lessors which will increase its Summer '20 fleet to 30 
- all Airbus - aircraft, which will allow Lauda to grow its traffic from 4m guests in year 1 to 6m guests 
in year 2 (FY March 2020) to 7.5m guests in FY March 2021.
 --     This summer, Laudamotion will operate 4 bases as it grows in Vienna from 4 to 8 aircraft, 
Dusseldorf 7 aircraft, Stuttgart 3 aircraft, and Palma 2 aircraft. In winter 2019, the Vienna base will 
increase further to 11 aircraft, making Laudamotion Vienna's No.2 airline, just behind Austrian Airlines. 
Laudamotion is releasing the first part of its winter 2019 flight schedules today, offering passengers 
lower fares and more frequencies, from Vienna in particular. Details of up to 20 new routes from Vienna, 
Stuttgart, Dusseldorf, and Palma, will be announced in the next month or two once airport and handling 
negotiations have been successfully completed.
 --     Laudamotion today announced details of up to 400 new jobs for pilots, cabin crew, and engineers 
across its 4 bases. It also unveiled details of its new Head Office (at Concorde Business Park), which it 
will move into in March 2019, and released details of a 250,000 seat sale with fares starting from 
EUR19.99 one way for travel in Feb, Mar, Apr and May from Vienna, Stuttgart, and Dusseldorf bases.
 Speaking in Vienna today, Laudamotion's CEO, Andreas Gruber, said:
 "With the backing of Ryanair, Laudamotion is set to grow strongly over the next 3 years to carry 10m 
passengers p.a. We will release details of up to 20 new routes for winter 2019 once we have completed our 
airport and handling negotiations by the end of March. Our summer '19 program will allow us to carry 6m 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Laudamotion announce Ryanair acquires 100% holding
passengers in year 2, a growth rate of 50% over the 4m carried in year 1, as we continue to offer our 
customers in Vienna, Stuttgart, Dusseldorf and Palma the lowest air fares on a fleet of young Airbus 
aircraft with widespread passenger appeal and great Lauda service."
 Laudamotion's Deputy CEO, Colin Casey, said:
 "We are currently negotiating new routes and handling agreements with more than 50 new airports, all of 
whom want to share in Laudamotion's exciting growth plans for the coming years. As other airlines falter, 
close bases or put themselves up for sale (as in the case of Germania recently), we are inundated with 
applications from pilots and cabin crew who wish to join Austria's No.1 low fares airline as we embark on 
exciting growth plans, not just in Austria and Germany, but in other new countries as well. In winter 2019 
we hope to announce at least one new base, which will be outside of Austria and Germany, and there are a 
number of new airports both in Central & Western Europe who are pitching to win this business.
 At a time when Austrian Airlines are carrying 13.9m passengers, we have exciting plans to grow to 10m 
passengers within next 3 years and become Austria's No. 2."

 Ideagen PLC (AIM: IDEA), a leading supplier of Information Management Software to highly regulated industries, 
announces that it has allotted a total of 6,409 new ordinary shares of 1 penny each in the capital of the Company

 Application has been made to the London Stock Exchange for the 6,409 new Ordinary Shares to be admitted to 
trading on AIM ("Admission") and it is expected that Admission will become effective and trading will commence at 
8.00 a.m. on 1 February 2019.
 After Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue will be 219,245,969 and the total number of voting 
rights will therefore be 219,245,969. This figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the 
calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest 
in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.

 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or

 This announcement contains inside information.
 RYANAIR LOWERS FULL YEAR GUIDANCE FROM
 EUR1.1BN - EUR1.2BN RANGE TO EUR1.0BN - EUR1.1BN RANGE
 Ryanair today (18 Jan) lowered its full year profit guidance (excl. Lauda) from a current PAT range of 
EUR1.1bn - EUR1.2bn to a new range of EUR1.0bn - EUR1.1bn due to:
 -     Lower winter fares, which are expected to fall 7% (previous guidance -2%);
 -     Stronger traffic growth, up 9% to 142m (prev. guidance of 141m);
 -     Stronger ancillary sales as more customers choose lower cost optional services;
 -     Slightly better than expected H2 unit cost performance.
 This guidance excludes (exceptional) start-up losses in Lauda, which have been cut from EUR150m to 
EUR140m on the back of better than expected unit cost performance during the winter period.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "While we are disappointed at this slightly lower full year guidance, the fact that it is the direct 
result of lower than expected H2 air fares, offset by stronger than expected traffic growth, a better than 
expected performance on unit cost and ancillary sales is positive for the medium term. There is short haul 
over capacity in Europe this winter, but Ryanair continues to pursue our price passive/load factor active 
strategy to the benefit of our customers who are enjoying record lower air fares. We believe this lower 
fare environment will continue to shake out more loss making competitors, with WOW, Flybe, and reportedly 
Germania for example, all currently for sale.
 Both Ryanair and Lauda will report stronger than expected traffic growth, an improving ancillary revenue 
performance, and strong unit cost discipline this winter, which helps to defray the impact of these lower 
than expected winter fares. The fact that we are passing on these benefits, in the form of lower air 
fares, to customers is good for Ryanair's traffic growth, good for our business over the medium and long 
term, and good for market share as evidenced by Norwegian's recent announcement of its plans to close 
bases in Rome, Gran Canaria, Tenerife and Palma, where they competed head to head with Ryanair.
 While we have reasonable visibility over forward Q4 bookings, we cannot rule out further cuts to air 
fares and/or slightly lower full year guidance if there are unexpected Brexit or security developments 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LOWERS FY19 GUIDANCE TO EUR 1.0BN - 1.1BN
which adversely impact yields between now and the end of March. As we are in a closed period, we will 
update shareholders in detail on these developments following our Q3 results release on Mon 4th Feb."
 ENDS.

 UK Civil Aviation Authority begins enforcement action against Ryanair
 The UK Civil Aviation Authority has today started enforcement action against Ryanair, following the airline's 
decision that financial compensation is not payable under European Commission Regulation 261/2004 for flight 
disruption resulting from industrial action by the airline's staff this summer.
 Ryanair passengers have made claims for compensation directly to the airline, but these have been rejected. 
Passengers have then been able to escalate their complaints to AviationADR, a body approved by the Civil Aviation 
Authority, to provide alternative dispute resolution for passenger complaints.
 Ryanair has now informed the Civil Aviation Authority that it has terminated its agreement with AviationADR.
 As the Civil Aviation Authority said at the time of the industrial action, in its view, the strikes were not "extraordinary 
circumstances" and were not exempt, meaning consumers should be compensated in accordance with Regulation 
EC261/2004.
 As a result of Ryanair's action, passengers with an existing claim will now have to await the outcome of the Civil 
Aviation Authority's enforcement action.

 The information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as 
stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014. Upon the publication of this 
announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.
 3 December 2018
 Stobart Group Limited
 ('the Group')
 Update on Capital Review and Q4 dividend
 The Group has continued to progress its growth plans for Stobart Aviation, which reported a 37% year-on-
year increase in passenger numbers at London Southend Airport, and Stobart Energy, which reported a 72% 
year-on-year increase in tonnes supplied at the time of its Interim Results in October.
 This operational progress has continued during the second half and the Group is trading in line with 
expectations. This progress has also led the Group to identify an increasing number of potential projects 
with attractive forecast returns on capital.
 The expansion opportunities at London Southend Airport are increasingly evident in view of the 
opportunities arising from the commercial agreements with Ryanair and easyJet, together with other airline 
partners. The agreements provide confidence that the airport will record significantly increased passenger 
numbers from next year, with the Group targeting 5 million passengers from 2022 at GBP10 EBITDA per 
passenger.
 Similarly, Stobart Energy has a number of investment opportunities which are being evaluated including 
building, owning and operating renewable energy plants that will generate long-term, sustainable operating 
cashflows.
 In consideration of these opportunities, the Group announced at its Interim Results in October that it 
would undertake a detailed capital review to ensure that the Group is best placed to optimise shareholder 
returns. The Board of Stobart Group intends to update the market on the full results of this review at the 
time of the Pre-Close Trading Statement in March 2019.
 The Board has also considered the appropriate level of the FY19 Q4 dividend. Since March 2017, the Group 
has paid dividends to shareholders of GBP105m funded via disposals of non-strategic assets. Over the same 
period, gross capital expenditure of GBP67m has been invested in its operating divisions. Though the Group 
owns non-strategic assets with a book value at 31 August 2018 included in the Interim Statement of 
Stobart Group Limited Update on Capital Review and Q4 dividend
GBP149m, the Board believes it is prudent financial discipline to use proceeds from further disposals in 
the medium term primarily to invest in value-creating opportunities based on sustainable operating cash 
generation and to maintain a strong balance sheet. It therefore intends to reduce the Q4 dividend to 1.5p 
per share. This means that the total dividend paid in the current financial year is 15p per share 
(previous financial year: 16.5p per share).
 The Board recognises the importance of dividends to its shareholders and will update the market 
accordingly, once it has completed the capital review.
 A dividend of 1.5p per share will be paid on 31 January 2019 to shareholders on the register as at 11 
January 2019.
 The person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of Stobart Group is 
Louise Brace, Company Secretary.

 Overview
 easyJet delivered a strong performance in the 2018 financial year. The airline's strong revenue growth 
reflects the strength of its network, brand and value offer.
 easyJet's strategy will enable it to continue to be a structural winner within its chosen network in the 
European short-haul market and across all market conditions.
 easyJet has focused on strengthening its strategic positioning, investing in its network and acquiring 
operations at Tegel. easyJet continues to implement its customer focused strategy by securing and building 
on leading positions at primary airports to drive profitable growth and deliver resilient returns over the 
long term.
 Disruption has been a major factor for easyJet and the industry this year. easyJet is investing 
significantly in resilience to reduce the impact on customers.
 During the year easyJet has reviewed and refreshed its strategic framework which is now called 'Our 
Plan'. This plan includes our new Purpose 'seamlessly connecting Europe with the warmest welcome in the 
sky', five Priorities and 'Our Promise'. easyJet has now recruited a number of people whose expertise and 
experience will help to lead and deliver the implementation of Our Plan.
 Revenue
 Total revenue increased by 16.8% to GBP5,898 million (2017 GBP5,047m). This includes GBP198 million of 
revenue from Berlin Tegel operations. Total revenue per seat grew by 6.4% to GBP61.94 (2017 GBP58.23) and 
by 4.7% at constant currency.
 Passenger revenue grew by 15.4% to GBP4,688 million (2017 GBP4,061m). This performance was driven by:
 --     passenger growth of 10.2% to a record 88.5 million, an increase of 8.3 million, including 3.9 
million new passengers at Tegel;
 --     an increase in the overall load factor by 0.3ppts to a record 92.9%, with strong demand in the 
underlying business (ex-Tegel, up 1.0ppt to 93.6%) partially offset by lower start-up loads in Berlin;
 --     underlying demand growth, with good performance in particular from our core markets in the UK and 
France, where easyJet's brand and network positions are well established;
 --     the benefit of one-off events including the Monarch and Air Berlin bankruptcies and Ryanair winter 
2017/2018 UK schedule cancellations; and
 --     industrial action in France that led to a benefit of circa GBP20 million as competitor airline and 
train customers switched to easyJet's services.
easyJet PLC Final Results -2-
 Ancillary revenue was also very strong and grew 22.7% (18.4% growth excluding Tegel) to GBP1,210 million 
(2017 GBP986m). This reflected easyJet's attractive products and innovative ancillary management; in 
particular:
 --     new bag segmentation (15/23kg offer) leading to better conversion rates and higher overall yields, 
reflecting an attractive price point for 15kg and demand for the higher weight;
 --     improved bag pricing algorithms that better reflect demand;
 --     allocated seating demand driving higher conversion rates through pricing improvements; and
 --     Improvements to our website making it easier for customers to add ancillary products.
 Cost
 Headline cost per seat increased by 4.4% to GBP55.87 (2017 GBP53.52), driven by exchange rates, 
underlying cost inflation and the cost of disruption, which remains a major industry challenge. Headline 
cost per seat at constant currency increased by 2.7% to GBP54.97 (2017 GBP53.52). Headline cost per seat 
excluding fuel increased 5.3% to GBP43.43 (2017 GBP41.27) (increase of 4.8% at constant currency). Total 
cost per seat, including the impact of non-headline items, was GBP57.26 (2017 GBP53.78).
 The overall cost performance, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, is driven by:
 --     the impact of disruption, an industry-wide issue, with significant third party industrial action 
activity (Air Traffic Control (ATC) and ground handling) particularly in France, Air Traffic Control 
capacity constraints due to systems upgrades and weather events. As a result cancellations increased 
significantly to 6,814 (2017: 2,502);
 --     crew cost inflation, including agreed pay deals, inefficiency due to disruption, higher crewing 
levels to support resilience and helped by higher than expected retention;
 --     general inflation, including the cost of regulated airports; and
 --     a negative impact from Airbus delivery delays resulting in lower than planned standby aircraft, 
and wet leased aircraft.
 This was offset by:
 --     total cost programme savings during the year of GBP107 million. This ongoing cost programme aims 
to drive efficiencies from easyJet's business model; and
 --     in particular this reflected better cost control in airport costs (flat per seat at constant 
currency excluding Tegel) and lower navigation rates.
 Total fuel cost increased by 11.5% (GBP122 million) to GBP1,184 million (2017 GBP1,062m) as a result of 
capacity growth, higher Emissions Trading System (ETS) costs and adverse foreign exchange movements. Fuel 
cost per seat at constant currency decreased by 4.3% to GBP11.72 (2017 GBP12.25) helped by easyJet's lower 
year-on-year effective fuel price.
 Tegel operations
 On 15 December 2017 easyJet completed the acquisition of part of Air Berlin's operations at Berlin Tegel 
airport. This resulted in easyJet becoming the largest short haul operator in the Berlin market, 
leapfrogging both Ryanair and Lufthansa, with Tegel complementing easyJet's already well-established 
Berlin base at Schönefeld.
 easyJet's flying programme at Tegel started on 5 January 2018, operating an adopted winter schedule with 
a fleet of mainly wet leased aircraft. As anticipated, Tegel flying has resulted in a dilutive impact to 
overall load performance and revenue per seat and an increase in cost per seat whilst the operation 
becomes established.
 Overall progress to date has been in line with expectations and on track to demonstrate the value of this 
strategic acquisition. Since start-up, easyJet has seen strong operational performance with on-time 
performance of 82% (versus a network average of 75%). Brand consideration scores have also improved 
significantly (+5pts) in Germany as a result of easyJet's increased presence. Demand has been growing 
steadily with load factors reaching 86% over the summer period, despite a currently inefficient schedule.
 The headline profit impact was worse than first expected due to increases in the unhedged fuel cost, 
airport charges and taxes as well as late competitive capacity in the market. Performance improved during 
the summer, as easyJet took direct control of its Revenue Management System to improve data decisions and 
revenue profiles.
 The total loss for the year is better than originally expected at GBP152 million due in part to faster 
than planned transition of crew and fleet.
 In financial year 2019 easyJet's operations in Berlin will benefit from a longer selling window, schedule 
improvements, a full flying programme, no planned wet lease costs and pricing optimisation. Schedule 
optimisation will continue into the 2020 financial year.

Non-headline items are material non-recurring items or are items which do not reflect the trading 
performance of the business. These costs are separately disclosed. The most significant items were as 
follows:
 --     Commercial IT platform charge: GBP65 million
 o  Over the past three years easyJet has been investing in its commercial IT platform which has delivered 
revenue benefits through significant improvement in its customer facing website and seating capability, as 
well as improvements in underlying resilience and control systems. However, in 2018 easyJet made the 
decision to change its approach to technology development through better utilisation and development of 
existing systems on a modular basis, rather than working towards a full replacement of our core eCommerce 
platform. As a result of this change in approach, a non-headline charge of GBP65 million has been 
recognised, relating to IT investments and associated commitments that are no longer required. easyJet 
will continue to invest in its digital and eCommerce layers that will enable it to continue to offer a 
leading innovative, revenue enhancing and customer-friendly platform.
 --     Transition and integration cost of Air Berlin's Tegel operations: GBP40 million

 Aberdeen Standard European Logistics Income PLC (LSE: ASLI) (the "Company")
 LEI: 213800I9IYIKKNRT3G50
 19 November 2018
 PURCHASE AGREEMENTS SIGNED FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ASSETS LOCATED IN ZEEWOLDE AND 
WADDINXVEEN, THE NETHERLANDS, FOR A TOTAL VALUE OF EUR62.25 MILLION
 Zeewolde
 The Board is pleased to announce that the Company has exchanged contracts to acquire a newly built pre-let 
warehouse in Zeewolde, the Netherlands, for a purchase price of EUR29.25 million providing a net initial yield of 
5.0%. The agreement with developer Borghese, a developer of logistics, residential and office and projects, is 
structured as a forward funded transaction with a 2.55% coupon rate. The development commenced in September 
2018 and has an expected delivery date of 1 June 2019.
 This high quality freehold property has been pre-let to VSH Fittings B.V., a strong covenant tenant, on a 15 year 
lease commencing in June 2019 and capped CPI indexation of 2.4% per annum in accordance with local 
provisions. VSH Fittings B.V. was founded 85 years ago and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aalberts Industries 
N.V., a Euronext listed company with over 16,000 employees, 70 business locations and activities in over 50 
countries. The company specialises in the production and distribution of industrial valve products and fittings used 
for sprinklers, heating and piping systems. VSH is based in the towns of Amersfoort and Hilversum, but is looking to 
consolidate its growing business in Zeewolde.
Aberdeen Standard Eur Lgstc Inc PLC New Acquisitions, Outlook and Gearing
 Zeewolde is located in the heart of the Netherlands in the province of Flevoland, close to Almere, the fastest 
growing municipality in the Netherlands and Lelystad, an ideal location for national distribution. The economy of 
Flevoland is flourishing and will be boosted by the expansion of Lelystad Airport (both Transavia and Ryanair will be 
using the airport from 2019). The attractiveness of the region is proven by the development of a new warehouse for 
Inditex (Zara) with a total size of 100,000 square metres opening in 2019. Zeewolde is also ideally located close to 
several motorways, the A6, A27 and A28. In addition to its central location in the Netherlands, Zeewolde is well 
positioned with regards the availability of labour and the relatively low land costs, resulting in attractive rent levels.
 The property is situated within an established logistics business park in Zeewolde, alongside other well-known 
logistics companies. The tenure is freehold and the total plot size is 55,000 square metres, with the warehouse 
comprising 35,000 square metres alongside office space and 161 parking places. Developed to the latest standards 
for modern logistics, the Manager believes that this together with the central location and the long lease with a 
strong covenant tenant will generate a durable income stream in the future.
 Waddinxveen
 The Company has also signed a sale-and-leaseback purchase agreement for the acquisition of an existing cross-
dock warehouse in Waddinxveen for EUR33 million and a net initial yield of 5.0%. The property is leased to 
Combilo International B.V. on a 15 year triple net lease with capped CPI indexation of 2.5% per annum.
 Waddinxveen is centrally located in the heart of the densely populated Randstad conurbation close to Gouda with 
an excellent road network via the A12 and A20 linking with the Hague and Rotterdam through to Germany. The 
property is located on the Distripark Business Park which is occupied by several large logistics companies. Vacancy 
rates in this part of the Netherlands remain very low for logistics warehousing space and the municipality is seeking 
to prevent oversupply.
 The freehold property itself is an existing cross-dock warehouse of approx. 28,000 square metres with 51 loading 
doors providing excellent facilities across 6 units (5 being cooled). Cross-docking is the procedure of unloading 
materials from an incoming vehicle and loading them directly into outbound vehicles with little or no storage in 
between. The building has good free height and floor load capacity and flexibility which lends itself to conversion to 
multi-tenant use. Additional land provides future asset management options.
 Combilo International B.V. is a stable, family-owned company that specialises in the import and export and 
packaging of fruit and vegetables for supermarkets and wholesalers. The company has a broad client base across 
Europe. Combilo has occupied the building since 2001. Its commitment to the location and building is explained by 
the central location in the Randstad, the most densely populated area in the Netherlands, and the large 
concentration of greenhouses with growers of fruit and vegetables.
 The Manager believes this warehouse will generate a durable income stream thanks to its central location, good 
building specifications and long lease with a strong covenant tenant with the potential option to further expand the 
building.
 Outlook - future acquisitions and gearing
 With the exchange of contracts on Zeewolde and Waddinxveen, the Company has now invested, or committed to 
invest, the whole of the net equity proceeds raised at launch in December 2017. In line with expectations set out at 
the time of launch, the Company has therefore deployed its initial funds in a portfolio comprising 8 properties spread 
over 4 countries, of which 5 are brand-new high quality warehouses. The current portfolio is expected to generate a 
healthy income return thanks to an average lease length of 10.8 years, all with indexed leases to strong covenant 
tenants. The pipeline of investment opportunities for the Company remains strong, with the Investment Manager at 
very advanced stages of due diligence on a number of potential acquisitions. As a result the Company is also in the 
process of putting gearing facilities in place, secured on certain properties within the portfolio, to provide financing 
for additional assets and to fund stage payments that are required for forward funded projects.
 The Board and the Investment Manager remain confident that the market for European logistics assets will 
continue to offer many attractive investment opportunities in the future, and the intention remains to seek to grow 
the Company through further equity issuance in the coming months, alongside the deployment of associated debt in 
accordance with the Company's prevailing gearing guidelines.
 The Board recognises the need for the Investment Manager to continue to build a portfolio of the highest quality 
assets to provide shareholders with the targeted levels of return and with the in-depth due diligence required. At the 
same time, it is cognisant of the very strong levels of market interest for logistics assets seen over the past twelve 
months and the tightening of yields which has ensued. The Board remains committed to the overarching maximum 
gearing policy limit of 50 per cent. of gross assets; however, subject to the requisite formal approval by 
Aberdeen Standard Eur Lgstc Inc PLC New Acquisitions, Outlook and Gearing
shareholders in general meeting, it expects to seek to adjust materially the current gearing guideline of 30-35 per 
cent. of gross assets in the very near future, with a view to ensuring that the Company's targeted returns remain 
achievable without compromising on the very high quality of logistics assets which the Investment Manager has 
already brought to the portfolio.

 RYANAIR SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH VER.DI (GERMAN) CABIN CREW UNION
 ITALIAN CABIN CREW - HUGE VOTE FOR CLA WITH 88% MAJORITY
 CABIN CREW RECOGNITION AGREEMENTS SIGNED IN GREECE AND SWEDEN
 Ryanair today (8 Nov) confirmed that it has signed a Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) framework and Social 
Plan with Ver.di, the German cabin crew union, to cover all of Ryanair's German based cabin crew. This agreement 
(which is now subject to a cabin crew ballot) confirms the application of German labour law to Ryanair's cabin crew 
and delivers pay increases and other benefits for all Ryanair German based cabin crew over the next two years.
 Ryanair also confirmed that its Italian cabin crew have voted overwhelmingly (88%) in favour of the CLA signed 
recently between Ryanair and the 3 main cabin crew unions FIT CISL, ANPAC, and ANPAV. This CLA, which 
delivers pay and benefit improvements, will now apply to all of Ryanair's cabin crew in Italy for the next 3 years.
 Over the past week, Ryanair has also signed new recognition agreements with cabin crew unions in Greece 
(RACU) and Sweden (UNIONEN). Ryanair will now work with these unions on long term CLAs to cover cabin crew 
in Greece and Sweden.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:
 "We are pleased to sign this CLA agreement with Ver.di, which will lead to pay improvements and other benefits for 
our German based cabin crew, subject to them voting in favour of this agreement over the coming week. This 
follows a very successful CLA ballot in Italy and recent cabin crew recognition agreements in Greece and Sweden.
 These are further concrete signs of the substantial progress Ryanair is making in concluding agreements with our 
people and their unions in many different EU countries."

 RYANAIR OCT TRAFFIC GROWS 11% TO 13.1m CUSTOMERS

 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (5 Nov) released Oct traffic statistics as follows:
 --    Traffic grew 11% to 13.1m with a 96% load factor
 --    Ryanair traffic grew 7% to 12.6m customers with a 96% load factor
 --    Lauda traffic was 0.5m customers with an 89% load factor

Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's Oct traffic (which includes Lauda) grew by 11% to 13.1m customers, due to lower fares and continuing 
success of Lauda's summer schedule.
 During October, we were forced to cancel just over 300 flights because of a five day airport handler strike at 
Brussels Zaventem, some adverse weather (winter storms) and continuing ATC staff shortages in the UK, Germany 
and France. We operated over 71,400 scheduled flights with over 80% of these flights arriving on time, as Ryanair 
continues to deliver the lowest fares, with the best punctuality of any major EU airline."

 RYANAIR SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH BELGIAN PILOT & CABIN CREW UNIONS CNE-CSC & LBC-NVK
 Ryanair today (25 Oct) announced that it has signed Collective Labour Agreements (CLAs) with the Belgian unions 
CNE-CSC and LBC-NVK to cover all of Ryanair's directly employed pilots and cabin crew in Belgium. Belgian 
Labour Law will apply to all Ryanair pilots and cabin crew in Belgium no later than 31st January 2019.
 This follows similar agreements signed over the past week with pilot unions SEPLA in Spain, SPAC in Portugal and 
BALPA in the UK, covering all of Ryanair's directly employed Spanish, Portuguese and UK Pilots.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:
 "We are pleased to have signed this latest CLA covering all of our directly employed pilots and cabin crew in 
Belgium. These signed union agreements in Belgium, Spain, Portugal and the UK again demonstrate the 
considerable progress we're making in concluding union agreements with our people in our major EU markets.
 We expect that these new agreements will encourage the cabin crew unions in both Spain and Portugal to remove 
competitor airline employees (who have been blocking progress) and to quickly conclude cabin crew agreements in 
those two countries, as that's what our Portuguese and Spanish cabin crew are now demanding."

London Southend Airport has successfully attracted new airlines and passengers as we continue to invest in our 
airport proposition. The airport is set for substantial growth in 2019 and beyond as further airlines are attracted to 
the airport and new routes are added.
 In the first six months, passenger numbers increased by 37% to 838,742 (2017: 610,492). easyJet's decision to 
base a fourth aircraft at the airport is expected to result in over one million easyJet passengers in 2018. We also 
signed a milestone agreement with Ryanair to base three aircraft at London Southend, expected to bring a further 
one million additional passengers annually from Summer 2019. Including agreements with Air Malta and Adria 
Airways, we are now offering routes to an additional 11 destinations and expect to welcome circa 2.5 million 
passengers in 2019.
 We are driving performance through an improving customer proposition which increases profitability per 
passenger. For example, we signed a new agreement with The Restaurant Group (TRG) to introduce six new food 
and beverage brands to the airport. So far, we have opened Giraffe STOP and Costa Coffee outlets under this 
agreement and expect to open a new bespoke pub, The Navigator, later this year. We were also delighted to have 
achieved an occupancy rate of over 90% at The Holiday Inn. London Southend was voted the best London airport 
by passengers in the annual Which? magazine survey for the sixth year running, and it was rated the most 
accessible airport in London and the South East by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
 With our existing airport capacity becoming better utilised as passenger numbers increase, we will leverage this 
fixed cost base, with additional capital expenditure, resulting in an improved cost per passenger, in turn increasing 
profitability.
 The progress made with new and existing airlines, combined with our enhanced customer proposition, puts us well 
on track to deliver our target to welcome five million passengers by 2022.
 Stobart Jet Centre
 With over 1,000 movements so far this year, Stobart Jet Centre has already exceeded the volume of business 
seen in the whole of 2017 as capacity has been increased and we have attracted more international customers. We 
have been encouraged that The Jet Centre is securing return visits by customers due to the high quality of its 
service.
 We are increasingly confident that Stobart Jet Centre will become a significant contributor to London Southend 
Airport's financial performance in the short to medium term.
 Stobart Air
 Stobart Air operates flights under franchise agreements with Aer Lingus and Flybe. The business is recognised 
within the industry for its operational excellence and quality of customer service.
 During the period Stobart Air saw improvements in the total number of passengers, passengers per flight and 
revenue per passenger. Total passenger numbers increased by 16.9% to 1.1 million (2017: 0.9 million) during the 
period.
 Stobart Air has played a fundamental part in the growth strategy for London Southend Airport. As previously 
announced, Stobart Group incurred net costs of GBP18.0 million in route development and marketing for the 
airport. This expenditure represents the development of routes operated under the UK Flybe franchise operation 
(UKFFO). Demonstrating route viability and building customer awareness was central to securing a milestone 
agreement with Ryanair that will allow us to accelerate the growth of the airport. The UKFFO, for which tickets went 
on sale in December 2016 and which commenced flights in May 2017, is being withdrawn following the agreements 
with easyJet and Ryanair to expand their operations at LSA. The jet operation will cease before the end of the 
current financial year, and the ATR turboprop operation before the end of the following financial year.
 Stobart Air intends to grow its valuable relationship with Aer Lingus, maximise its revenue potential and improve 
load factors on established routes. Stobart Air will also leverage the value of its aircraft by securing additional 
commercial relationships with other airlines.
 Stobart Aviation Services
Stobart Group Limited Interim Results -2-
 Stobart Aviation Services is a start-up business launched to exploit Stobart's logistics expertise to deliver ground 
handling operations at airports.
 During the period, Stobart Aviation Services secured its first major milestone external contract at London Stansted 
with easyJet. This contract has been running for circa six months, allowing the business to demonstrate its service 
expertise and capabilities. Stobart Aviation Services has also put in place the right structure, teams and systems to 
deliver the backbone of an efficient ground handling service, so it is now well positioned to scale-up by securing 
additional contracts.
 Stobart Energy
 Stobart Energy is the UK's leading provider of biomass, with long-term agreements in place to supply two million 
tonnes per annum, and the capacity to provide three million tonnes per annum by FY 2022.

 A key driver for the 72% growth in tonnes of fuel sold was that plants commissioned last year are now approaching 
commercial volumes. Underlying EBITDA per tonne continues to prove the business model and is ahead of our 
2018 strategic target of GBP10 per tonne with the year-on-year improvement driven by customer mix, the benefits 
of increased volume and continued focus on cost management.
 The continuing challenges around the commissioning of third-party power stations means that, although volumes 
sold have increased year-on-year, our infrastructure has been under-utilised. Two major plants in Widnes and 
Tilbury have experienced unplanned outages during the first half of the year. Commissioning also started later than 
expected at Margam and Templeborough and the development of Port Clarence has slipped to early 2019.
 Consequently, we continue to work hard to maintain the integrity and viability of the supply chains we have created 
for these plants resulting in non-underlying costs of GBP2.2m.
 We continue to invest in people, processing and storage capacity, and have specialist transport fleet and IT 
systems to ensure we have a best in class infrastructure ready to deliver a full end-to-end supply chain solution to 
our customers.
 Though it continues to prove challenging to forecast accurately the successful operation of third-party power plants, 
we expect further progress in the second half. We are confident the business has the right infrastructure in place to 
ensure the division can grow rapidly as more plants start to operate on a more consistent basis.

 RYANAIR REPORTS H1 PROFIT DOWN 7% TO EUR1.20BN
 LOWER FARES, HIGHER OIL & EU261 COSTS LEAVES FY19 GUIDANCE UNCHANGED AT EUR1.10BN - 
EUR1.20BN (EXCL. LAUDAMOTION)
 Ryanair today (22 Oct.) reported a 7% fall in H1 profits ("PAT") to EUR1.20bn (excl. Laudamotion losses). Average 
fares declined 3% due to excess capacity in Europe, an earlier Easter in Q1, repeated ATC strikes/staff shortages 
which caused a spike in cancellations of higher fare, weekend flights.  Higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs have 
offset strong ancillary revenue growth.

* excl. EUR45m exceptional H1 FY19 Laudamotion loss
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "As recently guided, H1 average fares fell by 3%.  While ancillary revenues performed strongly, up 27%, 
these were offset by higher fuel, staff and EU261 costs. Our traffic, which was repeatedly impacted by the 
worst summer of ATC disruptions on record, grew 6% at an unchanged 96% load factor.
 H1 highlights include:
 --     Traffic grew 6% to 76.6m (LF 96%)
 --     Ave. fare fell 3% to under EUR46
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
 --     Ancillary revenue rose 27% to EUR1.3bn
 --     Agreements signed with Irish, UK, Italian, Portuguese (pilots) & German (cabin crew) unions
 --     Laudamotion holding increased to 75%
 --     23 new B737s delivered
 --     EUR540m returned to shareholders via buybacks
 New Routes & Growth:
 We took delivery of 23 new B737s in H1 (bringing the fleet to 450) and launched over 100 new S.18 routes.  
We have trimmed winter capacity by 1% (including base closures in Eindhoven and Bremen) in response to 
weaker fares and higher oil prices. We expect FY19 traffic will grow to 141m (incl. 3m Laudamotion).  As 
we look beyond this winter, we have announced new S.19 bases in Bordeaux, Marseille, London Southend and 
increased capacity in Luton.  We plan to operate over 100 new routes in S.19.
 With spot fuel reaching $85bbl, rising interest rates and the stronger US dollar, airline margins are 
under pressure and it is inevitable that more of the weaker, unhedged, European airlines will fold this 
winter.  In recent weeks Skyworks (Switz.), VLM (Bel.), Small Planet & Azur Air (Ger.), Cobalt (Cyprus) 
and Primera Air (Stansted & Scandinavia) collapsed.  At the same time, many larger airlines are closing 
bases and cutting routes to minimise winter losses.  We expect more failures this winter and we cannot 
rule out further capacity cuts or base closures in Ryanair if oil prices rise or air fares fall further. 
Over the medium term, this consolidation will create growth opportunities for Ryanair's lowest fare/lowest 
cost model.
 Laudamotion:
 In August, we increased our holding in Laudamotion to 75%.  Despite a very difficult first summer, 
Laudamotion will carry almost 3m guests this year but will lose approx. EUR150m in start-up Year 1 
exceptional costs.  We are working closely with the Laudamotion team who recently launched their S.19 
schedule which will see them grow their fleet to 23 aircraft (including 19 A320's).  Laudamotion have 
reached agreement to return 9 expensive lease aircraft to Lufthansa this winter and will replace those 
with lower cost, longer term, operating lease aircraft, which are readily available at competitive terms 
as more Airbus operators fail.  We are assisting them to improve cost control, fuel hedging and fleet 
management which will deliver significantly higher revenues and much lower costs next year as the airline 
moves towards break-even in its 2(nd) year of operation.
 Ancillaries:
 Our investment in Labs continues to deliver strong ancillary revenue growth.  In H1 ancillaries increased 
by 27% to EUR1.3bn and drove an 8% increase in total revenue to EUR4.8bn.  Key drivers of this growth were 
improved conversion of priority boarding and reserved seating.  Membership of "MyRyanair" has increased to 
50m members and the Ryanair digital platform now welcomes over 1bn visits p.a.  A major upgrade of our 
digital platform is underway (website, app & 3(rd) party ancillary product plug-in) which will facilitate 
improved personalisation and capacity for traffic growth to 200m p.a. as we rollout relevant ancillary 
products which fit to each individual customer's profile and buying patterns.
 Cost Leadership:
 No other EU airline can match, or come close to, Ryanair's lowest unit costs and this cost gap is 
widening. Airports across Europe are incentivising Ryanair's reliable traffic growth. As others fail, 
these incentives are improving. Thanks to our balance sheet strength, our fuel is better hedged than most 
European competitors with 90% of our 12 month needs (to end Sept. 2019) hedged at approx. $68bbl, well 
below current spot prices of close to $85bbl.  FY19 is a year of investment in our people, our systems and 
our business as we prepare to grow to 200m guests p.a. In H1 ex-fuel unit costs increased by 7%. This 
includes 20% pay increases for pilots, investment in engineering headcount, pilot/cabin crew training 
costs and, regrettably, elevated EU261 costs arising from repeated ATC strikes/disruptions. Next spring, 
we take delivery of our first B737-MAX-200 "gamechanger" aircraft.  These planes have 4% more seats, yet 
are 16% more fuel efficient, have 40% lower noise emissions, are hedged at an average EUR/$ rate of $1.24 
(for 210 aircraft out to FY24) and they will drive continuous unit cost reductions over the next 6 years.
 ATC Strikes/Staff Shortages:
 Repeated ATC strikes/staff shortages means that 2018 will be the worst year on record for European ATC 
disruptions. These have caused widespread damage to airline punctuality and schedules.  Ryanair's H1 on-
time fell to 75% from 86% (prior year), with all of this 11% decline due to ATC strikes and ATC staff 
shortages. We've invested heavily to ensure that everything we control is delivering on-time departures.  
We have changed our handling provider at Stansted to ensure that we receive dedicated passenger and 
aircraft handling, and eliminate the short staffing we suffered at times in Stansted this summer. Ryanair 
and other airlines have initiated legal action against the French Government to keep Europe's skies open 
during French ATC disruptions. A4E (Airlines for Europe) and Ryanair are also campaigning for the European 
Commission to take control of the EU air space so that overflights are not disrupted during national ATC 
strikes.  This does not alter or constrain any individual's "right to strike" but tries to confine the 
impact of these ATC strikes to the actual country where the strike occurs.  We continue to call for urgent 
action from the EC to reduce ATC disruptions in S.19.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
 Union Progress:
 Since Ryanair agreed to recognise unions in December 2017, we've made good progress with our union 
negotiations in major markets including agreements with pilot and cabin crew unions in Ireland, Italy, the 
UK, Germany (cabin crew) and last week an agreement with our Portuguese pilots.  We continue to engage 
with unions in our other major markets.  Progress has been slower in other markets such as Spain & 
Portugal (cabin crew) and Germany (pilots) where competitor employees have interfered to delay agreements 
with our people and their unions.  While we suffered a small number (just 8 days) of limited strikes this 
summer, we worked well to minimise disruptions to our customers by operating over 90% of our schedules on 
each of these days, thanks in large measure to the efforts of the majority of pilots and cabin crew who 
did not support these disruptions and worked normally. Ryanair has shown over the past 10 months that we 
can, and will, work with unions to reach fair and reasonable agreements for our people while retaining our 
competitiveness and efficiency.  We can also manage strikes, although we do our utmost to avoid them. We 
will continue to negotiate and conclude union agreements over this winter.  While we hope to finalise more 
union agreements in the coming months, we cannot rule out occasional industrial action, but we expect 
their impact to be very limited.
 Brexit:
 The risk of a hard ("no-deal") Brexit in March 2019 is rising.  While we hope that a 21-month transition 
agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), we remain concerned that 
the time to complete such an agreement is shortening.  In the event of a hard Brexit our UK shareholders 
will be treated as non-EU.  In such an event the Board will restrict the voting rights of all non-EU 
shareholders (and confine them to selling shares only to EU nationals) to ensure that Ryanair remains 
majority owned and controlled by EU shareholders.  We have applied for a UK AOC to protect our 3 domestic 
UK routes and are on track to receive it before the end of 2018.

 As updated on 1 October, FY19 PAT is guided in a range of EUR1.10bn to EUR1.20bn (excl. Laudamotion).  
Following a 3% reduction in H1 fares, we expect fares to fall by c.2% in H2 due to weaker than expected forward 
fares in Q3 (particularly the October school mid-term and Christmas) and the absence of Easter in Q4.  A 1% 
reduction in winter capacity means that FY19 traffic will grow by 6% to 138m (141m incl. Laudamotion).  Our fuel bill 
will be approx. EUR460m higher than last year and "Other Costs" will be negatively impacted by higher EU261 
costs. Ancillaries continue to perform strongly although (as previously highlighted) the H2 figures will be adversely 
impacted by timing differences on the recognition of certain fees arising from the adoption of IFRS 15 (positive 
impact in H1).  This guidance excludes (exceptional) start-up losses in Laudamotion of approx. EUR150m (which 
are and will be consolidated in the Ryanair Group full year financial results).
 This full year guidance remains heavily dependent on air fares not declining further (they remain soft this winter 
due to excess capacity in Europe), the impact of significantly higher oil prices on our unhedged exposures, the 
absence of unforeseen security events, ATC and other strikes and the impact of negative Brexit developments. We 
cannot rule out further base closures or capacity cuts this winter if oil prices rise or air fares fall further. Winter 
trading may be positively impacted by the rate and timing of other airline failures which is already creating a ready 
supply of well trained pilots and cabin crew for S.19 growth."

Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -2-
 Certain of the information included in this release is forward looking and is subject to important risks and 
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  It is not reasonably possible to itemise all of the 
many factors and specific events that could affect the outlook and results of an airline operating in the European 
economy.  Among the factors that are subject to change and could significantly impact Ryanair's expected results 
are the airline pricing environment, fuel costs, competition from new and existing carriers, market prices for the 
replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, uncertainties surrounding 
Brexit, weather related disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and 
charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in 
Ireland, the UK and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel and other economics, social 
and political factors and unforeseen security events.

new and existing carriers, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, 
UK, European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, uncertainties 
surrounding Brexit, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and charges, labour 
relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in Ireland, the UK, 
and Continental Europe, the general willingness of passengers to travel, other economic, social and political factors 
and flight interruptions caused by volcanic ash emissions or other atmospheric disruptions.

Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
Exceptional item: The Group presents certain items separately, which are unusual, by virtue of their size 
and incidence, in the context of our ongoing core operations, as we believe this presentation represents 
the underlying business more accurately and reflects the manner in which investors typically analyse the 
results. Any amounts deemed exceptional for MD&A purposes have been classified for the purposes of the 
income statement in the same way as non-exceptional amounts of the same nature.
 The exceptional item in the half-year ended September 30, 2018 relates to the exceptional start-up losses 
of Laudamotion, which became a subsidiary of Ryanair at the start of August 2018.
 Going concern
 Having considered the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial position and cash 
flows, the Directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the interim financial statements, 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of 
the interim financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the interim financial statements.
 Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the half-year ended September 30, 2018 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2018 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2018, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2018, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
 The September 30, 2018 figures and the September 30, 2017 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2018, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2018 on October 19, 2018.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance with 
the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial statements, 
which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with IFRS as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 Accounting for Investment in associates
 An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence.  Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the entity, but is not control over these 
policies. The Company's investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method.  The 
consolidated income statement reflects the Company's share of profit/losses after tax of the associate.  
Investments in associates are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost adjusted for post-
acquisition changes in the Company's share of net assets, less any impairment in value.  If necessary, any 
impairment losses on the carrying amount of the investment in the associate are reported within the 
Company's share of equity accounted investments results in the consolidated income statement.  If the 
Company's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred 
obligations in respect of the associate.
 Accounting for business combinations
 Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the date that control is 
transferred to the Group. Under the acquisition method, consideration transferred is measured at fair 
value on the acquisition date, as are the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
 When the initial values of assets and liabilities in a business combination have been determined 
provisionally, any subsequent adjustments to the values allocated to the identifiable assets and 
liabilities (including contingent liabilities) are made within twelve months of the acquisition date and 
presented as adjustments to the original acquisition accounting.  Acquisition related costs are expensed 
in the period incurred.
 Accounting for subsidiaries
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
 Subsidiaries are all entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to 
(has rights to) variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 
returns through its power over the entity.
 The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the Group Income 
Statement from the date at which control of the entity was obtained. They continue to be included in the 
Group Income Statement until control ceases.
 Newly effective EU-endorsed standards and amendments
 The following new and amended standards, have been issued by the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the 
EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after January 
1, 2018 and therefore have been applied by the Group for the first time in these condensed consolidated 
interim financial statements;
 --    IFRS 15: "Revenue from Contracts with Customers including Amendments to IFRS 15" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018) (see below)
 --    IFRS 9: "Financial Instruments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2018) (see below)
 --    Amendments to IFRS 2: "Classification and Measurement of Share Based Payment Transactions" 
(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)
 --    Annual Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2018)

fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)
 --    Amendments to IAS 40: "Transfers of Investment Property" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on 
or after January 1, 2018)
 New standards and amendments issued but not yet effective
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for the purposes of 
the preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. A more detailed transitional impact for 
IFRS 16 is included below.  While under review, we do not anticipate that the adoption of the other new or 
revised standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position or results 
from operations:
 --    IFRS 16: "Leases" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019) (see below)
 --    IFRIC 23: "Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2019)

periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020)
 This is the first set of financial statements for which IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 have been applied. Changes to 
significant accounting policies, together with the impact of adoption, are described below:
 IFRS 15:  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 The Company has adopted IFRS 15 with effect from April 1, 2018. The standard establishes a five-step 
model to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount.  Revenue is recognised when the good or 
service has been transferred to the customer and at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled.
 The impact of initially applying the standard is mainly attributed to certain ancillary revenue streams 
where the recognition of revenue is deferred under IFRS 15 to the flight date where it was previously 
recognised on the date of booking.  For the majority of our revenue, the manner in which we previously 
recognised revenue is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 15.  The change in the timing of ancillary 
revenue recognition means that an increased amount of revenue will be recognised in the first half of the 
year under IFRS 15, with less revenue recognised in the second half of the year, particularly in Quarter 
4.
 The Company has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients), with 
the effect of initially applying this standard recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. April 
1, 2018). Accordingly, the comparatives have not been restated - i.e. they are presented, as previously 
reported, under IAS 18 and related interpretations.  The impact on transition to IFRS 15, was a reduction 
in retained earnings (net of tax) of EUR274.5M at April 1, 2018.
 The impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the Company's interim balance sheet as at September 30, 2018 was an 
increase in the amount of deferred revenue of EUR177.5M, compared with the amount that would have been 
recognised under IAS 18 and related interpretations. The impact on the interim income statement and the 
interim statement of comprehensive income is to increase ancillary revenue in the half-year ended 
September 30, 2018 by EUR97M.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -7-
 There is a nil net impact on the Company's interim statement of cash flows for the half-year ended 
September 30, 2018.
 IFRS 9:  Financial Instruments
 The Company has adopted IFRS 9 with effect from April 1, 2018.  The standard introduces a new model for 
the classification and measurement of financial assets, a new impairment model based on expected credit 
losses and a new hedge accounting model to more closely align hedge accounting with risk management 
strategy and objectives. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
 Financial assets, excluding derivatives, are accounted for at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss depending on the nature of the contractual cash 
flows of the asset and the business model in which it is held. All of Ryanair's financial assets continue 
to be held at amortised cost. Accordingly, no transition adjustment to carrying values arose in the half-
year ended September 30, 2018. Neither was there a material increase in provisions as a result of applying 
the new expected loss impairment model to our financial assets and our hedge accounting provisions did not 
materially change as a result of adoption of IFRS 9 in the half-year ended September 30, 2018.
 IFRS 16:  Leases
 IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
 The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption is 
permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of 
initial application of IFRS 16.  Ryanair does not intend to early adopt IFRS 16.
 We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures but do not expect the impact to be material.
 2.            Judgements and estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the half-year ended September 
30, 2018 was 8.9% (September 30, 2017: 10.6%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2018 
of EUR112.8M (September 30, 2017: EUR153.2M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR144.1M, a deferred tax 
credit of EUR19.6M relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in 
the income statement and a deferred tax credit of EUR11.7M relating to Laudamotion losses.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR5.0M (September 30, 2017: EUR3.0M) is the fair value 
of various share options granted in current and prior periods, which are being recognised within the 
income statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At September 30, 2018 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 451 (2017: 403) Boeing 737 aircraft and 9 Airbus 
A320 leased aircraft.  The Group agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing 
Corporation during the periods FY15 to FY19 of which 177 aircraft (including 23 in the half-year) were 
delivered at September 30, 2018.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24.

 Introduction
 For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance sheet 
commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the exceptional 
item referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the half-year under IFRS to the adjusted results is provided 
on page 11 and in note 8 of this interim financial report.

 10.          Property, plant and equipment

 Capital expenditure in the half-year ended September 30, 2018 amounted to EUR808.4M and primarily relates 
to aircraft pre delivery payments, 23 aircraft deliveries, spare engines, maintenance hangar construction 
costs and simulators.
 11.          Business combinations
 Acquisition of a Subsidiary
 In April 2018, the Company purchased a 24.9% stake in Laudamotion. This investment was accounted for 
using the equity method. In August 2018, the Group acquired a further 50.1% of the shares and voting 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -8-
interests in Laudamotion. As a result, the Group's equity interest in Laudamotion increased from 24.9% to 
75%. From this date the Group had a controlling interest in Laudamotion.
 In the period to September 30, 2018, Laudamotion contributed revenue of EUR48.3M and an operating loss of 
EUR46.8M to the Group's results. Ryanair also recognised EUR9.8M in share of losses in associate prior to 
consolidation of Laudamotion, and recognised a deferred tax credit of EUR11.7M relating to the recognition 
of a deferred tax asset re Laudamotion losses.
 Taking control of Laudamotion gives the group access to valuable slots at slot constrained airports in 
Germany, Austria & Palma in Spain.
 Consideration transferred and assets and liabilities assumed
 The following table summarises the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of 
acquisition of control and the consideration transferred to acquire control of Laudamotion:
EURM
 Consideration:
 - Consideration (liabilities & cash paid)        32
 - Fair value of existing equity interest          6
 - Elimination of intercompany loans              61
 -------
 Total                                             99
 -------
Net assets acquired:
 - Intangible assets                             100
 - Cash and cash equivalents                       7
 - Net other assets (liabilities) acquired       (8)
 -------
 Total                                             99
 -------
Fair values measured on a provisional basis
 Given the proximity of the acquisition to the period end, the fair value of Laudamotion's intangible 
assets (principally landing slots) has been determined on a provisional basis.
 Goodwill
 As the value of identifiable net assets acquired substantially equalled the value of the consideration 
paid plus the fair value of the existing interest in Laudamotion, there was a nil value attributed to 
Goodwill.  The re-measurement to fair value of the Group's existing 24.9% interest in Laudamotion, from 
its pre-acquisition carrying value of nil, resulted in a gain of EUR6M.  This amount has been included in 
share of associate losses in the condensed interim income statement.
 12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2018 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -8-
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at September 30, 2018 has been used 
to establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the half-year ended September 30, 2018, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments not measured at fair value
 --           Long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 2018 to

 13.          Shareholder returns
 In the half-year ended September 30, 2018 the Company bought back 35.8M ordinary shares at a total cost 
of EUR537M.  This buy-back was equivalent to approximately 3.1% of the Company's issued share capital at 
March 31, 2018.  35.5M of these ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled at September 30, 2018. The 
remaining 0.3M shares were cancelled on October 1, 2018.
 In FY18 the Company bought back 46.7M shares at a total cost of EUR829M.  This buy-back was equivalent to 
approximately 3.8% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2017.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2018.
 As a result of the share buybacks in the half-year ended September 30, 2018, share capital decreased by 
35.5M ordinary shares (46.7M ordinary shares in the year ended March 31, 2018) with a nominal value of 
EUR0.2M (EUR0.3M in the year ended March 31, 2018) and the other undenominated capital reserve increased 
by a corresponding EUR0.2M (EUR0.3M in the year ended March 31, 2018). The other undenominated capital 
reserve is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 14.          Related party transactions
 The Company has related party relationships with its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management 
personnel. All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the half-year ended September 30, 2018 that materially 
affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no 
changes in the related party transactions described in the 2018 Annual Report that could have a material 
effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.          Post balance sheet events
 Between October 1, 2018 and October 5, 2018, the Company had bought back 1.9M ordinary shares at a total 
cost of EUR23M to complete its EUR750M share buyback which commenced in February 2018.  This was 
equivalent to 0.2% of the Company's issued share capital at September 30, 2018.  All ordinary shares 
repurchased are cancelled.

 Independent review report to Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Introduction
 We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed set of consolidated interim financial 
statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended September 30, 2018 which comprises 
the condensed consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the 
condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed consolidated interim 
statement of cash flows, and the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in shareholder's 
equity and the related explanatory notes. Our review was conducted having regard to the Financial 
Reporting Council's ("FRCs") International Standard on Review Engagements ("ISRE") (UK and Ireland) 2410, 
'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity'.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -9-
 Conclusion
 Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set 
of consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly report for the six months ended September 
30, 2018 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial 
Reporting' as adopted by the EU, the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 ("Transparency 
Directive"), and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The 
Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the 
Transparency Directive and the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland. As disclosed in note 1, 
the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the EU. 
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the condensed set of consolidated interim financial 
statements included in this half-yearly financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 
'Interim Financial Reporting' as adopted by the EU.
 Our responsibility
 Our responsibility is to express to the company a conclusion on the condensed set of consolidated interim 
financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
 Scope of review
 We conducted our review having regard to the Financial Reporting Council's International Standard on 
Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity.  A review of interim financial information consists of making 
enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical 
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance 
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.

 RYANAIR SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH PORTUGUESE PILOT UNION SPAC
 BALPA (UK) SIGN SENIORITY AND BASE TRANSFER AGREEMENTS
 Ryanair today (Fri 19 Oct) announced that it has signed an agreement with the Portuguese pilot union SPAC, 
which will provide for seniority and base transfer agreements, to cover all of Ryanair's directly employed pilots in 
Portugal. Negotiations with SPAC on a full CLA under Portuguese Law with local contracts will now commence 
before the end of October.
 Ryanair also this week signed similar agreements with BALPA in the UK and ANPAC in Italy covering all of 
Ryanair's directly employed UK and Italian Pilots. Following negotiations in Madrid this week, Ryanair also expects 
to sign a recognition agreement with Spanish pilot union SEPLA shortly, which will pave the way for rapid 
negotiations on a CLA, and under Spanish law.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:
 "These signed agreements with our pilot unions in Portugal, the UK, Italy and shortly in Spain, demonstrate the 
considerable progress we're making in concluding union agreements with our people in our major EU markets.
 The recent wave of airline failures in Europe including Primera Air, Cobalt, Air Azur, and Small Planet (GER), as 
well as base closures/cuts announced by many of Europe's major airlines in response to higher oil prices and lower 
air fares, have given a significant stimulus to these union negotiations over recent weeks. Ryanair's pilots and cabin 
crew recognise that they enjoy better pay, better rosters, and significantly better job security than their counterparts 
at many other EU airlines, and we for our part, are recognising and working with unions to conclude agreements 
which address the major issues of concern to our pilots and cabin crew in all our major EU markets.
 I expect that these agreements in Spain, and Portugal in particular, will encourage the cabin crew unions in both 
those countries to remove competitor airline employees (who have been blocking progress) and to quickly conclude 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH POR PILOT UNION SPAC
cabin crew agreements in those countries, as that's what our Portuguese and Spanish cabin crew are now 
demanding."

or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).

 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (2 Oct) released September traffic statistics as follows:
 --    Total traffic grew 11% to 13.1m with a 97% load factor
 --    Ryanair traffic grew 6% to 12.6m customers with a 97% load factor
 --    Lauda traffic was 0.5m customers with a 93% load factor
 --    Two days of unnecessary pilot and cabin crew strikes (12 & 28 Sep) caused over 400 flight

Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's September traffic (which includes Lauda traffic) grew by 11% to 13.1m customers, while our load factor 
was unchanged at 97%, on the back of lower fares.
 Regrettably, over 400 flights were cancelled in September because of two days of unnecessary pilot and cabin 
crew strikes in 5 countries, and repeated ATC staff shortages in the UK, Germany and France.
 During the entire month of September, while we cancelled just over 400 flights, we completed over 68,000 
scheduled flights with more than 80% of these flights arriving on time, as Ryanair continues to deliver the lowest 
fares, with the best punctuality of any major EU airline."

 RYANAIR CUTS FY19 GUIDANCE BY 12% DUE TO HIGHER OIL PRICES, HIGHER EU261 COSTS, & WEAKER FARES DUE TO 
RECENT STRIKES
 Ryanair today (1 Oct.) lowered its full year profit guidance (excluding Laudamotion) from a current range 
of EUR1.25bn - EUR1.35bn, to a new range of EUR1.10bn - EUR1.20bn due to:
 -     Lower traffic and weaker close in fares in September, caused by 2 days of coordinated
 pilot/cabin crew strikes in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal;
 -     Lower Q3 fares as forward bookings (particularly for the Oct school mid-terms and
 Christmas) and customer confidence are affected by fear of further strikes;
 -     Higher EU261 care and re-accommodation costs arising from these recent strikes; and
 -     Higher prices (pbl$82) for our unhedged oil (10%).
 Ryanair noted that Q2 & Q3 traffic and fares will be somewhat lower than expected largely as a result of 
these 2 recent -5 country- strikes, which are being incited by competitor employees,
 despite the fact that Ryanair has agreed to meet union demands for local contracts, local law, and a 5 
week arbitration with pilots in Germany when the VC Union sought a prolonged 5 month
 arbitration.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "While we successfully managed 5 strikes by 25% of our Irish pilots this summer, 2 recent coordinated 
strikes by cabin crew and pilots across 5 EU countries has affected passenger numbers (through flight 
cancellations), close in bookings and yields (as we re-accommodate disrupted passengers), and forward air 
fares into Q3. While we regret these disruptions, we have on both strike days operated over 90% of our 
schedule. However, customer confidence, forward bookings and Q3 fares has been affected, most notably over 
the Oct school mid-terms and Christmas, in those 5 countries where unnecessary strikes have been repeated.
 These strikes have also added to our EU261 costs while, at the same time, our unhedged fuel costs have 
jumped as oil prices rise to pbl$82 which affects 10% of volumes, and all of Laudamotion's fuel bill.
 Like a number of other EU airlines, we have decided to trim our winter 2018 capacity (by 1%) in response 
to this lower fare, higher oil and higher EU261 cost environment. We are today implementing the following 
modest winter cuts (all from Mon. 5 Nov.)
 - Our 4 aircraft Eindhoven base will close, but most routes to/from Eindhoven will continue on overseas 
based aircraft.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CUTS FY19 GUIDANCE BY 12%
 - Our 2 aircraft Bremen base will close with most routes continuing on non-German aircraft.
 - Our 5 aircraft Niederrhein base will be cut to 3 aircraft with most routes continuing on the remaining 
3 aircraft.
 All affected customers have been contacted by email/SMS this morning and will be
 re-accommodated on other flights or refunded as they so wish. We will also now consult with our pilots 
and cabin crew at these 3 bases to minimise job losses.  We expect to offer our pilots vacancies at other 
Ryanair bases but, as we have a large surplus of winter cabin crew, we will explore unpaid leave and other 
options to minimise cabin crew job losses.
 Revised Outlook (excl. Laudamotion):
 We now guide FY19 PAT in a new range of EUR1.10bn to EUR1.20bn (previously EUR1.25bn to EUR1.35bn).  Q2 
fares are down approx. 3% (previously guided +1%) due to the weakness caused to close-in bookings and 
fares mainly as a result of these 2 (5 country) co-ordinated strikes in Sept. We had until last week 
expected stronger Q3 fares to recover softer Q2 yields but over the past week Q3 fares, and customer 
confidence, have been affected by worries about possible strikes. We are now guiding H2 fares down 2% 
(previously flat).  Our fuel bill will be approx. EUR460m higher (previously EUR430m) than last year and 
"Other Costs" will be negatively impacted by higher EU261 care and re-accommodation costs. Our slower 
traffic growth in H2 will cut FY19 traffic to 138m (previously 139m excluding Laudamotion).
 Since Ryanair agreed to recognise unions in Dec. 2017, we have made substantial progress with our union 
negotiations in major markets including Ireland, the UK, and more recently Italy, where we have signed 
multiyear CLA's with our pilots and cabin crew. Regrettably such progress has been impeded in Spain, 
Portugal, Germany, Holland, and Belgium where we've experienced interference in negotiations with our 
people and their unions, even when we offer them what they ask for (i.e. local contracts), in writing. 
When we have successfully negotiated agreements with unions in Ireland, the UK and Italy, and when we have 
offered local contracts and improved T&C's to our people in Belgium, Holland, Germany, Portugal and Spain, 
it is clear that these disruptions are unnecessary, and ill-judged at a time when other airlines are also 
cutting winter capacity.
 Ryanair cannot rule out further disruptions in Q3, which may require full year guidance to be lowered 
further and may necessitate further trimming of loss making winter capacity. Shareholders should note that 
the above guidance excludes start up (exceptional) losses in Laudamotion of approx. EUR150m (which will be 
consolidated into the Ryanair Group FY19, H1 and FY financial results)".

 In Bordeaux, Ryanair's Chief Commercial Officer, David O'Brien said:
 "We are pleased to open two new French bases in Bordeaux and Marseille, as we base 4 aircraft and invest 
$400m at the airports. Our growth will deliver 1.1m customers p.a. at Bordeaux Airport and 2.4m customers

 Chairman of the Executive Board of SA Bordeaux-Mérignac Airport, Pascal Personne said:
 "Ryanair's decision to base two aircraft at Bordeaux Airport is excellent news for the airport and for 
our region. This new base will undeniably increase the attractivity of New Aquitaine and represents the 
opportunity to develop a large number of new destinations. We have been actively working with Ryanair 
since 2009 and we believe that Ryanair's potential for growth with the commercial power we know they have, 
is very important for Bordeaux and is a sign of a long-term commitment."
 Philippe Bernand, Chairman of the Executive Board of Marseille Provence Airport, says:
 "We are very pleased with Ryanair's decision to accelerate its development in Marseille by opening a new 
base and offering 11 new destinations.
 It is an essential and historical partner of our Airport, and more generally of our territory, from a 
tourist and economic point of view. "

 RYANAIR AGREES CABIN CREW COLLECTIVE LABOUR AGREEMENT (CLA) FOR ITALY
 Ryanair today (25 Sep) confirmed that it has agreed a Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) with the 3 main 
cabin crew unions FIT CISL, ANPAC, and ANPAV, to cover all Ryanair's Italian based cabin crew from 1 Oct 
2018.
 This proposed CLA will:
 -     Run for 3 years from Fri 1 Oct 2018 to 31 Dec 2021
 -     Be governed by Italian law and the Italian Courts
 -     Allow Italian cabin crew transition to local contracts over an agreed period with immediate access 
to Italian benefits such as maternity and paternity leave.
 -     Deliver increased pay under a new pay structure, which will see crews benefit from increased tax 
free allowances (similar to other Italian airlines)
 -     Introduce an Italian Pension Scheme as part of the overall package
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:
 "We have signed a CLA with the 3 Italian cabin crew unions, which will cover all of our Italian based 
cabin crew, will lead to significant pay improvements and other benefits for our Italian based cabin crew, 
and will start from next month. This follows recent cabin crew agreements in Ireland with FORSA and in the 
UK with UNITE.
 This is a further sign of the significant progress Ryanair is making in reaching agreements with our 
people and their unions in different EU countries, and disproves false claims made by smaller unions not 
involved in these negotiations, and who are threatening strikes, which will either not take place or be 
unsuccessful.
 We have again invited our German, Portuguese and Spanish unions to meet with us so that we can negotiate 
and hopefully agree similar CLAs in these other larger markets."

 The information contained within this announcement is deemed to constitute inside information as 
stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014. Upon the publication of this 
announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.
 20 September 2018
 STOBART GROUP LIMITED
 ('Stobart Group' or 'the Group')
 Pre-Close Trading Statement
 Stobart Group Limited, the Aviation, Energy and Rail & Civils business, has today issued the following 
pre-close trading statement before the announcement of its interim results for the six months to 31 August 
2018. This announcement will be made on 24 October 2018.
 Highlights
 --     Aviation: Passenger numbers at London Southend Airport up by 37%; Ryanair flights starting in 
Spring 2019 and the easyJet partnership will drive further growth, with an additional aircraft added this 
summer
 --     Energy: Growth of processed tonnages sold up circa 50%
 --     GBP27.5 million net cash realised in sales from non-operating assets
 --     Interim dividend of 4.5p per share declared. This will be paid on 5 October 2018 to shareholders 
on the register as at 14 September 2018
 Stobart Group has continued to commercialise its core operating businesses, delivering operational 
progress in Aviation and Energy.
 At London Southend Airport, the Group has focused on improving awareness through branding and marketing, 
route development, and airline incentive deals to accelerate its growth. During the financial year, we 
accelerated the previously announced GBP30m to GBP40m investment plan, principally in relation to the 
franchised airline business, to enhance the value of the airport through an increase in sustainable and 
profitable passenger numbers. The introduction of Ryanair flights in Spring 2019 is the next step in the 
growth of our London airport. This significant long-term partnership agreement is expected to result in at 
least one million additional passengers in the first year and more than five million in the first five 
years.  A new agreement with The Restaurant Group to introduce six new food and beverage brands to the 
airport will help maximise the commercial value of these passengers.
Stobart Group Limited Pre-Close Trading Statement
 The agreement with Ryanair gives us further confidence that we will deliver on our aim to welcome five 
million passengers a year to the airport by 2022. The investment in the franchised operations from London 
Southend Airport has contributed successfully to the attraction of other airlines to the airport. The 
results of the Aviation division for the full year, excluding the investment in the franchise operations, 
are expected to be broadly in line with expectations.
 Stobart Energy has significantly increased underlying EBITDA and tonnes supplied compared to the prior 
year despite continued delays in the commissioning of third-party energy plants. These delays have put 
pressure on the supply chain for the second year running and exaggerated the impact of non-underlying 
costs. Therefore, the results for the Energy division will be slightly below expectations in the short 
term.  However, the investment in "best in class" infrastructure, including cutting-edge IT systems, means 
that Stobart Energy is well positioned to deliver strong profitability per tonne when energy plants are 
operating to target.
 Stobart Rail & Civils secured framework contracts with Network Rail, Transport for Greater Manchester, 
and is an Alliance member for the TransPennine route upgrade. The business also renewed its partnership 
with the Environment Agency to deliver Emergency Response. Other contract wins include the Newton Heath 
and Inverness maintenance facilities contracts with Northern and Scot Rail, providing previously untapped 
revenue streams. The business has reviewed its revenue recognition on long-term contracts and adopted a 
more prudent approach. This means the results for the year are likely to be lower than expectations.
 The Group has moved quickly to action the proposals set out by the Board in July designed to unify the 
interests of shareholders. It appointed a leading independent search firm Russell Reynolds as part of a 
thorough and rigorous process to refresh and further strengthen the Board. In August, the Board announced 
the appointment of Nick Dilworth as Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer, Ginny Pulbrook as Non-
Executive Director and Michael Williamson as Interim CFO.
 Warwick Brady, CEO, Stobart Group commented:
 "We are reviewing all aspects of the Group to ensure we are well placed to deliver the ambitious growth 
targets set by the Board to double the value of the business. We are confident that we can meet our 
commitment to shareholders to unify the business and provide the framework for the delivery of the 
Company's strategy to the benefit of all stakeholders."
 The person responsible for arranging the release of this announcement on behalf of Stobart Group is 
Louise Brace, Company Secretary.

 RYANAIR WELCOMES FRENCH SUPREME COURT RULING IN MARSEILLE CASE
 Ryanair today (19 Sept) welcomed the French Supreme Court ruling in the Marseille employment case, which 
confirmed Ryanair's position that the E101 certificates issued by Ireland in respect of its pilots and cabin crew who 
were temporarily based in Marseille are binding on the French Authorities and the French Courts as previously 
ruled by the ECJ. The French Supreme Court also cancelled all convictions against Ryanair and returned the Case 
to the Paris Court of Appeal for rehearing.
 This French Supreme Court ruling, which follows the ECJ ruling in the A-Rosa case, now obliges the French 
Authorities to accept and respect the Irish E101 certificates, which were issued to Ryanair's pilots and cabin crew 
who were temporarily based in Marseille during the period 2006 - 2010.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:
 "We welcome this favourable ruling from the French Supreme Court which fully respects the earlier favourable ECJ 
ruling in the A-Rosa case.
 We believe that this decision will now lead to an early and favourable conclusion of the criminal cases and tax 
demands in Aix-en-Provence. This should in due course lead to the repayment of up to EUR13m of social tax 
payments, which Ryanair was required to put into escrow to cover two such cases in 2014 and 2017.
 We welcome this French Supreme Court ruling, which now paves the way for Ryanair to consider re-entering the 
French market. We are already in discussions with a number of French airports, and the French Ministry of Labour, 
which we hope will lead to Ryanair announcing some bases in France in the near future, but with pilots and cabin 
crew based in France, on local French contracts, and paying their social taxes in France rather than Ireland.
 We have asked our lawyers to expedite the rehearing of this case by the Paris Court of Appeal now that the French 
Supreme Court and the ECJ in Strasbourg has ruled in favour of Ryanair and the Irish issued E101 certificates".

 RYANAIR REACHES AGREEMENT WITH ITALIAN UNIONS ON OUTLINE TERMS OF A COLLECTIVE LABOUR AGREEMENT (CLA)
 Ryanair today (14 Sept) confirmed that it met in Rome yesterday with the 3 main cabin crew unions FIT 
CISL, ANPAC, and ANPAV, and a set of agreed principles were signed, which will form the basis of a 
comprehensive Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) to cover Ryanair's Italian based cabin crew from 1 Oct 
2018. The parties agreed that they are "now in the final stages of concluding final terms and conditions 
of a CLA", which will:
 -     Run for 3 years from Fri 1 Oct 2018 to 31 Dec 2021
 -     Be governed by Italian law and the Italian Courts
 -     Allow Italian cabin crew transition to local contracts over an agreed period
 -     Deliver increased pay under a new pay structure, which will see crews benefit from increased tax 
free allowances (similar to other Italian airlines)
 -     Introduce an Italian Pension Scheme as part of the overall package
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said:
 "We welcome this agreement with the 3 Italian cabin crew unions on the terms of a Collective Labour 
Agreement (CLA), which will cover all of our Italian based cabin crew, and will start from next month. 
This agreement follows recent cabin crew agreements in Ireland with FORSA and in the UK with UNITE.
 We expect to sign this first CLA for our Italian cabin crew before the end of Sept, which will lead to 
significant pay improvements and other benefits for our Italian based cabin crew. This agreement is a 
further sign of the significant progress Ryanair is making in reaching agreements with our people and 
their unions in different EU countries, and disproves false claims made by smaller unions not involved in 
these negotiations, and who are threatening strikes later this winter, which will either not take place or 
be unsuccessful."

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES RECORD LONDON S19 SCHEDULE
 23 NEW ROUTES (180 TOTAL), 26M CUSTOMERS P.A. (UP 5%)
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (12 Sep) launched its biggest ever London S 2019 schedule, with 23 
new routes (over 180 in total), which will deliver 26m customers p.a. through Ryanair's 4 London airports 
- Stansted, Luton, Southend and Gatwick.
 Ryanair's London S19 schedule will deliver:
 --   A new 3 aircraft base at Southend
 --   2 more aircraft at Luton (6 in total)
 --   23 new routes including:
 3  at  Stansted:   Kiev, Lviv & Nantes
 6  at  Luton:       Alicante, Athens, Barcelona, Bologna, Cork, Malaga
 14 at Southend: Alicante, Bilbao, Brest, Copenhagen, Cluj, Corfu, Dublin, Faro, Kosice,
 Malaga, Milan, Palma, Reus & Venice
 --   Over 180 routes in total
 --   26m customers p.a. (up 5%)
 --   20,000(*) "on-site" jobs p.a.
 Last week Ryanair submitted a complaint to the European Commission over discrimination by UK airline 
controlled NATS at Stansted, who refuse to explain why 52% of all London ATC delays in Q1 were at Stansted 
while there was zero such delays at Heathrow and just 10% at Gatwick where (NATS' shareholders) BA and 
Easyjet are the main airlines.
 We call on the UK Govt and EU to take prompt action against NATS who continue to deliver an atrocious 
service to airlines despite having amongst the highest ATC fees in the EU, and who are blatantly 
protecting Heathrow at the expense of all other London airports, especially Stansted. We expect the EU to 
act quickly to ensure a fairer allocation of NATS resources (and delays) to all 5 London airports, instead 
of protecting Heathrow.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Ryanair is pleased to launch our biggest ever London S 2019 schedule with over 180 routes from our 4 London 
airports, including 1 new base at Southend and 23 new routes to exciting destinations such as Barcelona, Bilbao, 
Copenhagen and Kiev. Our S2019 schedule will deliver 26m customers p.a. through Stansted, Luton, Southend 
and Gatwick, all at the lowest fares, as we continue to grow London traffic, tourism and jobs.
 We remain concerned at the increasing risk of a hard (no-deal) Brexit in March 2019.  While we hope that a 21-
month transition agreement from March 2019 will be agreed, recent events in the UK have added uncertainty, and 
we believe that the risk of a hard Brexit (which could lead to flights being grounded for a period of days or weeks) is 
being underestimated."

Rules (the "Transparency Rules") and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/761 of 17 December 2014.
 (ii) Full name of the legal entity and other identifying specification of the issuer or underlying 
issuer, provided it is reliable and accurate (e.g. address, LEI, domestic number identity).

instruments referred to in Regulation 17(1) of the Regulations (Article 13(1) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 As the disclosure of cases of acting in concert may vary due to the specific circumstances (e.g. same or 
different total positions of the parties, entering or exiting of acting in concert by a single party) the 
standard form does not provide for a specific method how to notify cases of acting in concert.
 In relation to the transactions referred to in points (b) to (h) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations 
(Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC), the following list is provided as an indication of the persons who 
should be mentioned:
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (b) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity that acquires the voting rights and is entitled 
to exercise them under the agreement and the natural person or legal entity who is transferring 
temporarily for consideration the voting rights;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (c) of the Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity holding the collateral, provided the person or 
entity controls the voting rights and declares its intention of exercising them, and natural person or 
legal entity lodging the collateral under these conditions;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the natural person or legal entity who has a life interest in shares if that

 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (e) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the controlling natural person or legal entity and, provided it has a notification 
duty at an individual level under Regulation 14 of the Regulations (Article 9 of Directive 2004/109/EC), 
under letters (a) to (d) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of Directive 2004/109/EC) or 
under a combination of any of those situations, the controlled undertaking;
 -     in the circumstances foreseen in letter (f) of Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 of 
Directive 2004/109/EC), the deposit taker of the shares, if he can exercise the voting rights attached to

Directive 2004/109/EC), the proxy holder, if he can exercise the voting rights at his discretion, and the 
shareholder who has given his proxy to the proxy holder allowing the latter to exercise the voting rights 
at his discretion (e.g. management companies).
 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to 
the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 
2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Standard Form TR-1 -2-
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of 
the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
 (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.
 (viii) If the holding has fallen below the lowest applicable threshold in accordance with the Regulations 
and the Transparency Rules  the holder is not obliged to disclose the extent of the holding only that the 
holding is "below 3%" or "below 5%" as appropriate.

ends.
 (xi) If the financial instrument has such a period - please specify this period - for example once every

on a delta-adjusted basis (Regulation 17(4) of the Regulations/Article 13(1a) of Directive 2004/109/EC).
 (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control 
another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

 BOARD OF RYANAIR RESTORES SIX AIRCRAFT
 TO DUBLIN BASE FOR WINTER 2018
 The Board of Ryanair Holdings today (Fri, 7 Sept) announced that it has decided to restore six Dublin 
based aircraft which were due to transfer to Poland in November for the winter 2018 schedule.    The 
related protective notices issued to 300 Dublin pilots and cabin crew in July have also been withdrawn 
today.  This decision was taken to respond favourably to the mediation agreement overseen by Mr Kieran 
Mulvey, which brought an end to five days of unsuccessful but damaging strikes by less than 25% of 
Ryanair's Irish based pilots during July and August.
 Ryanair's Chief People Office, Eddie Wilson, said:
 "The Board of Ryanair today thanked independent mediator, Kieran Mulvey for his contribution in 
finalising an agreement between Ryanair and just 25% of our Irish pilots.  We regret that mediation became 
necessary after five days of unsuccessful strikes which, despite causing minimal damage to Ryanair's 
schedules, did damage our forward fares and yields to/from Ireland because of the perception of possible 
disruptions.
 The Board and management of Ryanair are committed to union recognition, and working constructively with 
our people and their unions to address their reasonable concerns, as long as this does not alter Ryanair's 
low cost model or our ability to offer low fares to our customers.
 Since December last year, when the Board announced that we would recognise unions, Ryanair's people have 
enjoyed significant pay increases, improved terms and conditions, and we have agreed to improved seniority 
structures, base transfers and annual leave.  We have done this in a year when we expect profits to fall 
by 15% due to a combination of higher fuel prices and higher staff costs."

 RYANAIR AUG TRAFFIC GROWS 9% TO 13.8M CUSTOMERS
 INCLUDES 0.5M LAUDA TRAFFIC FOR FIRST TIME
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (4 Sep) released August traffic statistics as follows:
 --    Total traffic grew 9% to 13.8m with a 97% load factor
 --    Ryanair traffic grew 5% to 13.3m customers with a 97% load factor
 --    Lauda traffic was 0.5m customers with a 92% load factor
 --    ATC staff shortages and one unnecessary pilot strike (10 Aug) caused almost 550 flight 
cancellations in August compared to just 27 cancellations in August 17

Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's August traffic (which includes Lauda traffic for the first time) grew by 9% to 13.8m customers, while our 
load factor was unchanged at 97%, on the back of even lower fares.
 Regrettably, over 100,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in August because of repeated ATC staff 
shortages in the UK, Germany and France, and one day of unnecessary pilot strikes. Ryanair, together with other 
European airlines, calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and Governments to correct these ATC staff 
shortages which are disrupting the travel plans of millions of Europe's consumers this summer."

 RYANAIR'S ITALIAN PILOTS VOTE IN FAVOUR OF COLLECTIVE LABOUR AGREEMENT (CLA) FOR ITALY
 ITALY ACCOUNTS FOR 20% OF RYANAIR'S FLEET AND PILOTS
 Ryanair today (28 Aug) confirmed that its Italian pilots had voted overwhelmingly in favour of a new Collective 
Labour Agreement (CLA) which was negotiated and signed between Ryanair and ANPAC (Italian Airline Pilots 
Association) on 9 August last.
 Ryanair welcomes this first pilot CLA in one of its largest EU markets. Today's vote in Italy comes shortly after Irish 
union FORSA has signed, and recommended, a mediation agreement to Ryanair's Irish pilots, who are currently 
voting to approve this agreement.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:
 "We welcome this first CLA with our Italian pilots and hope that it will be shortly followed by a similar agreement 
covering our Irish pilots. We have invited our UK, German and Spanish unions to meet with us in the coming days 
so that we can negotiate and hopefully agree similar pilot CLAs in these other larger markets. These agreements 
demonstrate the real progress being made by Ryanair in its negotiations with its pilots and their unions across 
different EU markets."

financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).

 RYANAIR JULY TRAFFIC GROWS 4% TO 13.1M CUSTOMERS
 LOAD FACTOR UNCHANGED AT 97% ON LOWER FARES
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (2 Aug) released July traffic statistics as follows:
 --    Traffic grew 4% to 13.1m customers
 --    ATC staff shortages, adverse weather and unnecessary pilot and cabin crew strikes caused over 1,000 
flight cancellations in July compared to just 23 cancellations in July 17
 --    Rolling annual traffic to July grew 7% to 133.5m customers
July 17   July 18   Change

 Customers       12.6M     13.1M     +4%
 --------  --------  -------
 Load Factor      97%       97%       -
 --------  --------  -------
Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's July traffic grew by 4% to 13.1m customers, while our load factor remained strong at 97%, on the back 
of lower fares.
 Regrettably almost 200,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in July because of repeated ATC staff 
shortages in the UK, Germany and France, adverse weather, and unnecessary pilot and cabin crew strikes. 
Ryanair, together with other European airlines, calls for urgent action by the EU Commission and European 
governments to address the effect of these ATC staff shortages which are disrupting the travel plans of millions of 
Europe's consumers this summer."

 RYANAIR TO CUT DUBLIN BASED FLEET BY 20% FROM 30 TO 24 FOR WINTER 2018
 90 DAY PROTECTIVE NOTICE ISSUED TO OVER 100 DUBLIN BASED PILOT & 200 CABIN CREW 
EMPLOYEES
 AT LEAST 6 DUBLIN AIRCRAFT SWITCH TO GROWING POLISH CHARTER AIRLINE
 Ryanair's Board today (25 July) approved a plan to cut its Dublin based fleet from 30 to (at most) 24 aircraft for the 
winter 2018 season. These reductions have been driven by the rapid growth of Ryanair's Polish charter airline, 
which is growing profitably in 2018, allied to a down turn in forward bookings and airfares in Ireland partly as a 
result of recent rolling strikes by Irish pilots, which has had a negative effect on (close-in) high fare bookings and 
forward air fares as consumer confidence in the reliability of our Irish flight schedules has been disturbed.
 Ryanair's Polish airline, Ryanair Sun, will now offer over 10 aircraft to Polish tour operators, more than double the 5 
aircraft offered in Summer 2018. We expect few route closures from Dublin, although some routes may suffer 
frequency reductions.
 In the light of these Dublin base cuts, Ryanair has today issued letters of (90 days) protective notice to over 100 
pilots and over 200 cabin crew employees, whose services may not be required from 28 Oct onwards, due to this 
20% reduction in the Dublin fleet this winter.
 Ryanair will now begin the consultations with its people on redundancy, which, if redundancies are necessary, will 
be determined by Ryanair's assessment of flight performance, productivity, attendances, and base transfer 
requests. Ryanair will be offering transfers to Poland (and possibly some other bases) to these Dublin based pilots 
and cabin crew employees for Winter 2018 in order to minimise any redundancies.
 Ryanair's COO Peter Bellew said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO CUT DUBLIN BASED FLEET BY 20% FOR W2018
 "We regret these base aircraft reductions at Dublin for Winter 2018, but the Board has decided to allocate more 
aircraft to those markets where we are enjoying strong growth (such as Poland), and this will result in some aircraft 
reductions and job cuts in country markets where business has weakened, or forward bookings are being damaged 
by rolling strikes by Irish pilots. Ryanair operates a fleet of over 450 aircraft from 87 bases across Europe. We can 
only do so if we continue to offer low fares, reliable flight services to our customers, and if our reputation for 
reliability or forward bookings is affected, then base and potential job cuts such as these at Dublin are a deeply 
regretted consequence".
 Editor's Note: Ryanair has invited Forsa and its Pilots Committee to a meeting this afternoon to brief them on these 
planned base cuts and job losses.

 RYANAIR Q1 PROFITS FALL 20% TO EUR319M DUE TO
 LOWER FARES, HIGHER FUEL & PILOT COSTS.
 FULL YEAR GUIDANCE UNCHANGED AT EUR1.25BN - EUR1.35BN
 Ryanair today (23 July) reported a 20% fall in Q1 profits to EUR319m (excl. exceptionals).  Strong traffic growth 
(up 7%), overcapacity in Europe, and the earlier timing of Easter led to a 4% decline in ave. fares. Higher fuel and 
staff costs offset strong ancillary revenue growth in the quarter.

* Excl. exceptional: 24.9% (EUR9m) share of Associate LaudaMotion Q1 loss.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "As previously guided, Q1 PAT fell by 20% to EUR319m due to lower fares, the absence of half of Easter in 
the quarter, higher oil prices and pilot costs.  Traffic grew 7% to 37.6m, despite over 2,500 flight 
cancellations caused by ATC staff shortages and ATC strikes. Ryanair's lower fares delivered an industry 
leading 96% load factor.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
 Q1 highlights include:
 -     Traffic grew 7% to 37.6m (LF 96%)
 -     Ave. fare fell 4% to EUR38.68
 -     Ancillary revenue rose 25%
 -     Ryanair Sun launched its summer charter programme in Poland
 -     EUR265m returned to shareholders via buybacks
 Revenues:
 We took delivery of 14 B737s in Q1 (bringing our fleet to over 440 units) and launched 239 new routes for 
S.2018.  Bookings are slightly ahead of last year, but at lower fares.  We continue to see overcapacity in 
the European market, with Germany in particular very price competitive this summer.  Q1 fares fell 4% to 
under EUR39 and we expect this weaker pricing environment (due to the World Cup, the Northern European 
heat wave and customer uncertainty about pilot strikes) to continue.  Our investment in Labs and AGB 
continues to drive improvements in ancillary revenue to 30% of total revenue in Q1.  Key drivers of this 
growth was improved conversion of reserved seating and priority boarding services.  Ryanair's digital 
platform now has over 1bn visits p.a. and continues to grow.
 Costs:
 Ryanair has significantly lower costs per passenger than our competitors.  Fuel prices have risen 
substantially from $50pbl at this time last year to almost $80pbl in Q1.  While we are 90% hedged at 
$58pbl our unhedged balance will see our full year fuel bill increase by at least EUR430m (incl. 
additional volumes).  We recently hedged 35% of H1 FY20 at $69pbl.  Q1 staff costs increased by 34% 
primarily due to pilot 20% pay increases, 9% more flight hours and a 3% general pay increase for our non-
flight staff.  EU-261 "right-to-care" costs jumped 40% in Q1 due to over 2,500 ATC flight cancellations in 
Q1.  For the remainder of FY19, we will continue to invest in our people, our systems, and our business as 
we scale up to take delivery of 210 MAX-200s ("Gamechangers"). These aircraft have 4% more seats and 16% 
lower fuel cost, and we expect them to deliver material unit cost reductions from FY21 onward when we 
start to retire older B737-800s.
 Balance Sheet:
 Our operations continue to be strongly cash generative.  Capex of EUR460m and shareholder distributions 
of EUR265m in the quarter were financed from strong cash flows while still cutting net debt from EUR283m 
in March to EUR259m at end June.  Our EUR750m share buyback programme is 70% complete, at an average price 
of EUR15.90. When complete later this year, we will have returned over EUR6bn to our shareholders since 
2008.
 ATC Staff Shortages & Strikes:
 Repeated ATC staff shortages (mainly in UK, Germany & Greece) and strikes (France) are causing widespread 
damage to airline schedules this summer.  French ATC, the worst offenders, went on strike for 9 of the 13 
weekends during April, May and June leading to thousands of cancelled flights.  Ryanair cancelled over 
2,500 flights (approx. 450,000 guests) in Q1, with a loss of higher yielding weekend traffic, and a steep 
rise in EU261 "right-to-care" costs. Punctuality was severely damaged (with only 75% of Q1 flights on-time 
compared to 89% last year).  Ryanair and other airlines have initiated legal action against the French 
Government to keep Europe's skies open during these unacceptably frequent French ATC disruptions.  Ryanair 
and A4E (Airlines for Europe) are campaigning for the European Commission to take control of the upper air 
space so that overflights, at least, are not disrupted during national ATC strikes.  This does not remove 
the "right to strike" but does confine more of the impact of strikes to the actual country where the 
strike occurs (i.e. France).  Regrettably, the European Commission remains slow to act on these measures 
and we call again on the EU to act decisively to minimise the impact of ATC disruptions to EU consumers 
and their families this summer.
 Higher Fuel Prices & Consolidation:
 With fuel at $80pbl (up from $50pbl last year), some weaker, unhedged, European airlines are suffering a 
significant cash flow squeeze and/or are close to breaching debt covenants.  We expect this will lead to 
further airline failures and consolidation this winter, which will provide growth opportunities, hopefully 
at stronger yields for Ryanair's low fares/low cost model.
 Strikes:
 In recent months we implemented a series of initiatives to make Ryanair more attractive to pilots and 
cabin crew, including (a) a 20% pay increase under 5-year pay agreements which makes our pilots 
significantly better paid than competitor (Norwegian & Jet2) B737 pilots; (b) we cut training/bonding 
costs for new pilot and cabin crew recruits; (c) we facilitated over 700 pilot transfers to their 
preferred base; (d) we invested heavily in new simulators and in house training capacity; and, (e) we 
announced we would recognise trade unions.
 Despite signing pilot and cabin crew union recognition agreements in our major markets (the UK and Italy, 
and a recent agreement in Germany for cabin crew), progress has been slower in smaller markets where 
competitor pilots are impeding both progress and process.  We suffered 2 unnecessary strikes by a small 
minority (25%) of Irish based pilots in July (with a 3(rd) strike threatened for 24 July).  Cabin crew 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results
have also threatened strikes in Spain, Portugal, and Belgium on 25 & 26 July.  We have minimised the 
impact of these strikes on customers by cancelling a small proportion of our flight schedule, well in 
advance of the day of travel, to allow our customers to switch flights or apply for full refunds. While we 
continue to actively engage with pilot and cabin crew unions across Europe, we expect further strikes over 
the peak summer period as we are not prepared to concede to unreasonable demands that will compromise 
either our low fares or our highly efficient model.
 If these unnecessary strikes continue to damage customer confidence and forward prices/yields in certain 
country markets then we will have to review our winter schedule, which may lead to fleet reductions at 
disrupted bases and job losses in markets where competitor employees are interfering in our negotiations 
with our people and their unions. We cannot allow our customers flights to be unnecessarily disrupted by a 
tiny minority of pilots.
 Brexit:
 We remain concerned by the danger of a hard ("no-deal") Brexit in March 2019.  While there is a view that 
a 21-month transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented (and extended), 
recent events in the UK political sphere have added to this uncertainty, and we believe that the risk of a 
hard Brexit is being underestimated.  It is likely that in the event of a hard Brexit our UK shareholders 
will be treated as non-EU.  We may be forced to restrict the voting rights of all non-EU shareholders in 
the event of a hard Brexit, to ensure that Ryanair remains majority owned and controlled by EU 
shareholders.  We have applied for a UK AOC to protect our domestic UK routes and hope to receive it 
before the end of 2018.
 Guidance:
 We continue to guide FY19 PAT in a range of EUR1.25bn to EUR1.35bn.  While Q1 fares were marginally 
stronger than previously expected, the recent weaker fare environment and the expected impact of crew 
strikes on forward pricing mean that Q2 fares will only rise by approx. 1% (previously guided +4%).  With 
almost zero H2 visibility, our H2 guidance of broadly flat fares remains unchanged at this time.  
Ancillary revenue continues to perform well but will not offset a EUR430m higher fuel bill or a 6% 
increase in ex-fuel unit costs.
 This guidance is heavily dependent on close-in Q2 fares, crew strikes, continuing ATC staff 
shortages/strikes, the absence of unforeseen security events and no negative Brexit developments.

 13.          Shareholder returns
 In the quarter ended June 30, 2018 the Company bought back 16.6M ordinary shares at a total cost of 
EUR265M. This buy-back was equivalent to approximately 1.4% of the Company's issued share capital at March 
31, 2018.  All of these repurchased ordinary shares were cancelled.
 In FY18 the Company bought back 46.7M shares at a total cost of EUR829M.  This buy-back was equivalent to 
approximately 3.8% of the Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2017.  All of these repurchased 
ordinary shares were cancelled at March 31, 2018.
 As a result of the share buybacks in the quarter ended June 30, 2018, share capital decreased by 16.6M 
ordinary shares (46.7M ordinary shares in the year ended March 31, 2018) with a nominal value of EUR0.1M 
(EUR0.3M in the year ended March 31, 2018) and the other undenominated capital reserve increased by a 
corresponding EUR0.1M (EUR0.3M in the year ended March 31, 2018). The other undenominated capital reserve 
is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 14.          Related party transactions
 The Company has related party relationships with its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management 
personnel. All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the quarter ended June 30, 2018 that materially affected the 
financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no changes in the 
related party transactions described in the 2017 Annual Report that could have a material effect on the 
financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.
 15.          Post balance sheet events
 Between July 1, 2018 and July 19, 2018, the Company had bought back 3.5M ordinary shares at a total cost 
of EUR54.9M under its EUR750M share buyback which commenced in February 2018.  This was equivalent to 0.3% 
of the Company's issued share capital at June 30, 2018.  All ordinary shares repurchased are cancelled.
 On July 12, 2018 the European Commission approved Ryanair's proposed acquisition of a further 50.1% 
interest in LaudaMotion, clearing the way for Ryanair to increase its holding to 75%.

 Introduction
 For the purposes of the Management Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") (with the exception of the balance 
sheet commentary below) all figures and comments are by reference to the adjusted results excluding the 
exceptional item referred to below.  A reconciliation of the results for the quarter under IFRS to the 
adjusted results is provided in note 8 of this financial report.
 The exceptional item in the quarter ended June 30, 2018 comprised the share in associate losses of 
EUR9.3M.
 MD&A Quarter Ended June 30, 2018
 Income Statement
 Scheduled revenues:
 Scheduled revenues increased by 3% to EUR1,454.0M due to 7% traffic growth (to 37.6M) offset by a 4% 
reduction in average fares to under EUR39.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues rose by 25% to EUR624.9M due to 7% traffic growth, improved uptake of reserved seating 
and priority boarding services and the positive timing of revenue recognition on certain fees (approx. 
EUR25M) following the transition to IFRS 15.
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil rose by 23% to EUR630.9M due to a 9% increase in block hours, higher fuel prices and a 300% 
increase in the cost of carbon credits.
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges increased by 5% to EUR280.1M, below the 7% traffic growth.
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs increased 34% to EUR244.9M due to the pilot 20% pay increases annualising, 9% more hours and 
a 3% pay increase for non-flight-staff awarded in April 2018 offset by weaker sterling.
 Route charges:
 Route charges rose 4% to EUR198.4M due to the 7% increase in sectors offset by a decrease in unit rates.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation is 13% higher at EUR157.2M due to 50 (+14%) more owned aircraft in the fleet at period end 
(2018: 414 / 2017: 364).
 Marketing, distribution and other:
 Marketing, distribution and other rose 29% to EUR129.7M.  EU261 "right to care" costs increased by 40% 
due to over 2,500 ATC related flight cancellations in the quarter and the higher propensity of passengers 
to claim compensation.  Marketing and distribution costs were in line with the growth in passenger 
numbers.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -4-
 Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by 37% to EUR49.3M due to higher scheduled engine 
maintenance costs due to the ageing fleet and the timing of lease handbacks.
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals fell by 16% to EUR17.9M due to the smaller leased fleet. (2018: 30 / 2017: 33)
 Unit costs rose by 10% (excluding fuel they increased by 7%).
 Net finance expense:
 Net finance expense decreased by 3% to EUR16.7M primarily due to lower interest rates and repayments of 
debt.
 Balance sheet:
 Gross cash fell by EUR45.0M to EUR3,635.1M at June 30, 2018.
 Gross debt fell by EUR68.5M to EUR3,894.5M due to debt repayments.
 EUR768.7M net cash was generated by operating activities. Capital expenditure was EUR461.8M and 
shareholder returns amounted to EUR265.2M.
 Net debt was EUR259.4M at period end.  (March 2018: EUR282.9M).
 Shareholders' equity:
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR358.9M to EUR4,827.8M in the period due to IFRS hedge accounting 
treatment for derivatives of EUR586.9M and net profit after tax of EUR309.2M, offset by EUR265.2M of 
shareholder returns and the IFRS 15 transition adjustment of EUR274.5M to opening reserves.
 Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 comprise the 
Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2017 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2017, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2018, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
 The June 30, 2018 figures and the June 30, 2017 comparative figures do not constitute statutory financial 
statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2017, together with the independent auditor's report 
thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual General Meeting 
and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial statements was 
unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 on July 20, 2018.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this year's financial information has been prepared in accordance with 
the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial statements, 
which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with IFRS as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 Accounting for Investment in associates (see Note 11)
 An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence.  Significant influence is the 
power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of the entity, but is not control over these 
policies. The Company's investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method.  The 
consolidated income statement reflects the Company's share of profit/losses after tax of the associate.  
Investments in associates are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at cost adjusted for post-
acquisition changes in the Company's share of net assets, less any impairment in value.  If necessary, any 
impairment losses on the carrying amount of the investment in the associate are reported within the 
Company's share of equity accounted investments results in the consolidated income statement.  If the 
Company's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the associate, the carrying amount is reduced to 
nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has incurred 
obligations in respect of the associate.
 The following new and amended standards, have been issued by the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the 
EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after January 
1, 2018 and therefore have been applied by the Group for the first time in these condensed consolidated 
interim financial statements;

Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
 * These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed.
 This is the first set of financial statements for which IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 have been applied. Changes to 
significant accounting policies, together with the impact of adoption, are described below:
 IFRS 15:  Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 The Company has adopted IFRS 15 with effect from April 1, 2018. The standard establishes a five-step 
model to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount.  Revenue is recognised when the good or 
service has been transferred to the customer and at the amount to which the entity expects to be entitled.
 The impact of initially applying the standard is mainly attributed to certain ancillary revenue streams 
where the recognition of revenue is deferred under IFRS 15 to the flight date where it was previously 
recognised on the date of booking.  For the majority of our revenue, the manner in which we previously 
recognised revenue is consistent with the requirements of IFRS 15.  The change in the timing of ancillary 
revenue recognition means that an increased amount of revenue will be recognised in the first half of the 
year under IFRS 15, with less revenue recognised in the second half of the year, particularly in Quarter 
4.
 The Company has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative effect method (without practical expedients), with 
the effect of initially applying this standard recognised at the date of initial application (i.e. April 
1, 2018). Accordingly, the comparatives have not been restated - i.e. they are presented, as previously 
reported, under IAS 18 and related interpretations.  The impact on transition to IFRS 15, was a reduction 
in retained earnings (net of tax) of EUR274.5M at April 1, 2018.
 The impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the Company's interim balance sheet as at June 30, 2018 was an increase 
in the amount of deferred revenue of EUR249.9M, compared with the amount that would have been recognised 
under IAS 18 and related interpretations. The impact on the interim income statement and the interim 
statement of comprehensive income is to increase ancillary revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2018 by 
EUR24.6M.
 There is a nil net impact on the Company's interim statement of cash flows for the quarter ended June 30, 
2018.
 IFRS 9:  Financial Instruments
 The Company has adopted IFRS 9 with effect from April 1, 2018.  The standard introduces a new model for 
the classification and measurement of financial assets, a new impairment model based on expected credit 
losses and a new hedge accounting model to more closely align hedge accounting with risk management 
strategy and objectives. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
 Financial assets, excluding derivatives, are accounted for at amortised cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss depending on the nature of the contractual cash 
flows of the asset and the business model in which it is held. All of Ryanair's financial assets continue 
to be held at amortised cost. Accordingly, no transition adjustment to carrying values arose in the 
quarter ended June 30, 2018. Neither was there a material increase in provisions as a result of applying 
the new expected loss impairment model to our financial assets and our hedge accounting provisions did not 
materially change as a result of adoption of IFRS 9 in the quarter ended June 30, 2018.
 IFRS 16:  Leases
 IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
 The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption is 
permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of 
initial application of IFRS 16.  Ryanair does not intend to early adopt IFRS 16.
 We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures but do not expect the impact to be material.
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -5-
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 
was 10.5% (June 30, 2017: 10.5%).  The tax charge for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 of EUR36.2M (June 
30, 2017: EUR46.6M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR34.1M and a deferred tax charge of EUR2.1M 
relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income 
statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR2.5M (June 30, 2017: EUR1.5M) is the fair value of 
various share options granted in current and prior periods, which are being recognised within the income 
statement in accordance with employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At June 30, 2018 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 444 (2017: 397) Boeing 737 aircraft.  The Group agreed 
to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY15 to FY19 
of which 168 aircraft (including 14 in the quarter) were delivered at June 30, 2018.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (135 firm and 75 options) Boeing 737-MAX-200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24.
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.

 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the 
CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made based on the 
entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in 
making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes 
within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Group for 
the year.  All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the 
Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Group's 
single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the quarter ended June 30, 2018 amounted to EUR461.8M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre delivery payments, 14 aircraft deliveries, spare engines, hangar construction costs and 
simulators.
 11.          Investment in associate
 In April 2018, the Company purchased an initial 24.9% stake in LaudaMotion and hopes to increase this 
holding to 75% in the coming weeks.
 12.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2017 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 1st Quarter Results -6-
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at June 30, 2018 has been used to 
establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, there 
were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments not measured at fair value
 --           Long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at June 30, 2018 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the quarter ended June 
30, 2018 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:
At Jun    At Jun     At Mar         At Mar
 30,       30,        31,            31,

 LaudaMotion is not included in this guidance.  We hope to increase our investment from 24.9% to 75% over the 
coming weeks having just received EU competition approval to do so. However, current trading for LaudaMotion 
has been adversely impacted by lower than expected S.2018 fares due to the late release of LaudaMotion 
schedules, and considerable damage caused by Lufthansa who have refused to pay invoices, delivered 9 instead of 
14 aircraft at lease rates that are substantially above market rates, and recently attempted to trigger a contract 
termination so it could give these aircraft to a competitor airline, Eurowings, in a clear breach of Lufthansa's 
competition commitments to the EU following its purchase of Air Berlin. In addition, LaudaMotion faces substantial 
cost headwinds especially in fuel, where it is unhedged and exposed to recent higher oil prices of close to $80pbl. 
We now expect LaudaMotion will lose approx. EUR150m in its first very difficult year, but these results will improve 
substantially to break even by year 3 of operations."

 RYANAIR RECOGNISES FIT CISL UNION FOR ITALIAN BASED CABIN CREW
 OVER 66% OF CABIN CREW NOW COVERED BY UNION RECOGNITION AGREEMENTS
 Ryanair today (20 July) signed a recognition agreement with the Italian union FIT CISL, who will now join ANPAC 
and ANPAV as a joint negotiating body for directly employed cabin crew in Italy.  The joint negotiating committee of 
FIT CISL, ANPAC and ANPAV will take effect from 24 July 2018 to commence negotiations on a CLA. The contract 
agencies (Crewlink and Workforce) employing cabin crew operating on Ryanair aircraft in Italy have also signed 
recognition agreements today with FIT CISL, ANPAC, and ANPAV, and negotiations on a CLA for contractor crew 
will also commence from 24 July 2018.
 Following yesterday's announcement yesterday of a cabin crew recognition agreement with Ver.di in Germany, 
Ryanair is now commencing negotiations on CLA's for over 66% of its people in its major markets of Italy, the UK 
and Germany.  Ryanair hopes that the cabin crew unions in Spain, Portugal and Belgium will soon follow this 
example by engaging in negotiations with Ryanair rather than disrupting Ryanair customers by going on 
unnecessary strikes.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer, Eddie Wilson said:
 "We are pleased to sign this cabin crew recognition agreement today with FIT CISL in Italy. This is a further sign of 
the progress Ryanair is making with trade unions since our December 2017 decision to recognise unions, with over 
66% of our cabin crew now covered by recognition agreements.
 We hope to announce further agreements over the coming weeks, in those countries where unions have 
approached these negotiations in a practical and positive manner. As this growing number of pilot and cabin crew 
recognition agreements confirms, we are making progress and confounding those sceptics who claimed that our 
December 2017 decision was not real or genuine. We look forward to working closely with both FIT CISL, and their 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Recognises FIT CISL Union For Cabin Crew
Company Council in negotiating a CLA for our directly employed Italian based cabin crew, and to shortly commence 
negotiations on a CLA for contractor crew with ANPAC, ANPAV and FIT CISL."

 RYANAIR WELCOMES EU APPROVAL OF ITS LAUDAMOTION PROPOSAL
 Ryanair today (12 July) welcomed the EU Commission's decision to approve Ryanair's proposed acquisition 
of a 75% interest in Austrian airline, Laudamotion (Ryanair currently owns 24.9%). Ryanair has entered 
into partnership with Niki Lauda to offer competition, lower fares, and more choice for consumers in 
Austria, Germany, and Spain, which is where the majority of Laudamotion services currently take place.
 However, Laudamotion is currently under threat by Lufthansa who are attempting to remove the 9 aircraft 
Lufthansa was obliged by the European Commission to provide to Laudamotion in order to allow Laudamotion 
to restart services.
 This is the latest in a series of efforts by Lufthansa to destabilise and damage Laudamotion, which has 
seen:
 -    Lufthansa fail to deliver 2 of the 11 aircraft they were required to under the EU Competition 
decision concerning Lufthansa's acquisition of Air Berlin.
 -    Some of the aircraft that Lufthansa had committed to deliver being delayed until after the summer 
2018 season, further reducing Laudamotion's ability to take up slots and offer S2018 flights and services.
 -    Laudamotion only able to operate a 19 aircraft fleet in summer 2018 by wet leasing 10 B737 aircraft 
from Ryanair.
 -    Lufthansa Group delay payment of over EUR1.5m of wet lease payments properly due to Laudamotion, for 
flights which Laudamotion operated for Lufthansa in March, April and May.
 Ryanair remains committed to bringing competition and choice to Austrian, German and Spanish markets 
through this investment in Laudamotion and called on the competition authorities to halt Lufthansa's 
repeated abuses of its dominant position, which are designed to harm competition and consumers.
 Ryanair's Chief Legal & Regulatory Officer, Juliusz Komorek said:
 "We welcome the EU Commission's decision to approve Ryanair's proposed acquisition of a 75% interest in 
Laudamotion. Ryanair remains committed to bringing competition, choice and low fares to the Austrian, 
German and Spanish markets through our investment in Laudamotion. We urge the EU competition authorities 
to take action and prevent any further attempts by Lufthansa to damage competition through its anti-
consumer behaviour."

 STOBART GROUP LIMITED
 ('Stobart Group' or 'the Group')
 AGM Statement
 Stobart Group, the infrastructure and support services group, will hold its Annual General Meeting ('AGM') today at 
11.00 a.m. at St Pierre Park Hotel, St Peter Port, Guernsey.
 Ahead of the meeting, the Board of Stobart Group provides the following update.
 We remain on track to deliver our medium-term objectives of i) growing our London airport in order to welcome five 
million passengers a year by 2022, ii) supplying over 3m tonnes of renewable energy fuel per annum by 2022 and 
iii) realising value through disposal of our non-operating assets to support the dividend.
 We have seen strong progress at London Southend Airport, with the announcement of a new five-year partnership 
with leading low-cost airline Ryanair.  This five-year agreement, extendable to ten, will see Ryanair make a $300 
million investment by opening a new base at London Southend Airport. As a result, Ryanair will operate three 
planes out of Stobart Group's London Southend Airport from Summer 2019, providing 13 routes to eight European 
countries, and will include six new destinations.
 Our Energy division has performed well, with tonnages up 54% year on year due to new contracts becoming 
operational.
 Following on from a strong track record in prior years, our Infrastructure division generated cash of GBP25.5m 
following the successful sale and leaseback of properties and land at our Widnes site. Further non-operating asset 
disposals are being pursued.
 Dividend
Stobart Group Limited AGM Statement
 A quarterly interim dividend of 4.5p will be paid today to shareholders who were on the register at 15 June 2018, 
bringing the total dividend for the year to 18.0p per share.
 Board Change
 Stobart Group further announces that Richard Laycock has decided to step down as its Chief Financial Officer and 
Executive Director and will not be putting himself forward for election at the AGM, but will continue to support the 
Stobart Group business.
 The Board has commenced an executive search to identify a suitable interim replacement for the role and a further 
announcement will be made as soon as possible.
 Outlook
 The Group has started the year trading satisfactorily and a further update will be provided when it announces its 
results for the six months to 31 August 2018, which is expected to be made on 18 October 2018.
 Warwick Brady, Chief Executive of Stobart Group, said: "Since stepping into my role last year, we have made 
significant progress across our business divisions, and continue to focus on delivering on our ambition to double the 
value of the business by 2022."

 Rentokil and carpet manufacturer, Victoria. Additional investments were made in
 Money Supermarket, BTG and Hilton Food. To fund these, Melrose, Crest Nicholson
 and SDL were sold.  Sales were also made of Micro Focus, Eve Sleep and Ibstock.
The Managers aim to position the portfolio to benefit from major secular
 trends, such as the continuing disruption in many sectors. This is not purely
 technology-driven change; consumer trends in tastes are a factor in Western
 economies. These have brought a focus on experiences rather than goods, and are
 showing less respect for longstanding brands.
Additional investment was made in travel. Rising oil prices pose a challenge
 for airlines, but in other ways prospects for the travel sector are
 improving.   Pricing discipline is being reinforced as some struggling airlines
 fail and capacity is rationalised.  Surviving airlines have been able to
 acquire slots of the collapsed airlines.   This consolidation reinforces
 prospects for efficient survivors, such as Ryanair and EasyJet.   Not only are
 ticket prices likely to rise, but the surviving airlines are proving more adept
 at using their customer data to sell hotels, car hire and  other travel
 services. The remaining businesses are creating an industry that looks much
 more attractive for shareholders.
Portfolio Review and Investment Strategy
Most companies in the portfolio are reporting good earnings progress, and the
 technology sector has performed particularly well. The portfolio not only has
 invested in a number of innovative technology businesses, but the investment
 strategy also recognises the impact of technology in other sectors.  Some
 portfolio businesses are using technology to cut costs or service customers
 better.  Technology is also enabling some companies to make their businesses
 more scalable and employ less capital.   Key to future investment success is
SVM UK Emerg Fund Annual Financial Report -2-
 understanding the pervasiveness of technology and the economic change it
 drives.
The portfolio includes a number of the newer disruptive businesses with
 significant growth potential.  There is a spread of holdings to recognise risks
 that individual companies may face in creating these new strategies.  Not all
 disruptors that target an opportunity actually succeed.  Even for the winners,
 it may take a few years and a lot of capital to establish the infrastructure
 and credibility needed.  So, there can be risk in investing too early, even if
 a management team appears to have promise.  Usually, there is a point at which
 it is clear the business is gaining traction and seeing accelerating sales
 growth.   This might be evident in like-for-like numbers or in endorsements it
 gains through strategic partnerships.  There is value in waiting for this
 timing, which may not be at the share price lows, but is before most of the
 potential has been secured.  The Managers monitor these companies, using
 analysis of numbers and regular meetings to get clues to this traction, and
 identify the best entry point.
Outlook
The UK economy has proved relatively resilient, with the resumption of real
 wage growth signalling a reversal of the consumer squeeze.  Inflation appears
 to have peaked at the end of 2017, and is likely to ease further this year.
 Already, it is falling faster than the consensus and Bank of England expected.
 Confidence in the UK is returning, but this has yet to transfer fully to
 shares.
Cash rich overseas companies appear interested in UK acquisitions. Merger
 activity has been strong to date this year, and corporate buyers seem to see
 the value in the UK market, even if institutional investors do not. That is
 often an early indicator of value in a stockmarket.
Meetings with company managements continue to be encouraging, and portfolio
 companies are making good progress.  We see considerable investment opportunity
 and accordingly the Fund is fully invested, with flexible borrow arrangements
 allowing a typical gearing of 120% of assets.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Directors review policies for identifying and managing the principal risks
 faced by the Fund.
Many of the Fund's investments are in small companies and may be seen as
 carrying a higher degree of risk than their larger counterparts. These risks
 are mitigated through portfolio diversification, in-depth analysis, the
 experience of the Manager and a rigorous internal control culture.  Further
 information on the internal controls operated for the Fund is detailed in the
 Report of the Directors.
SVM UK Emerg Fund Annual Financial Report -2-
The principal risks facing the Fund relate to the investment in financial
 instruments and include market, liquidity, credit and interest rate risk. An
 explanation of these risks and how they are mitigated is explained in note 9 to
 the financial statements. Additional risks faced by the Fund are summarised
 below:
Investment strategy - The risk that an inappropriate investment strategy may
 lead to the Fund underperforming its benchmark, for example in terms of stock
 selection, asset allocation or gearing. The Board has given the Manager a
 clearly defined investment mandate which incorporates various risk limits
 regarding levels of borrowing and the use of derivatives.  The Manager invests
 in a diversified portfolio of holdings and monitors performance with respect to
 the benchmark.   The Board regularly reviews the Fund's investment mandate and
 long term strategy.
Discount - The risk that a disproportionate widening of discount in comparison
 to the Fund's peers may result in loss of value for shareholders. The discount
 varies depending upon performance, market sentiment and investor appetite. The
 Board regularly reviews the discount and the Fund operates a share buy-back
 programme.
Accounting, Legal and Regulatory - Failure to comply with applicable legal and
 regulatory requirements could lead to a suspension of the Fund's shares, fines
 or a qualified audit report. In order to qualify as an investment trust the
 Fund must comply with section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 ("CTA").
 Failure to do so may result in the Fund losing investment trust status and
 being subject to Corporation Tax on realised gains within the Fund's
 portfolio.  The Manager monitors movements in investments, income and
 expenditure to ensure compliance with the provisions contained in section 1158.
 Breaches of other regulations, including the Companies Act 2006, the Listing
 Rules of the UK Listing Authority or the Disclosure and  Transparency Rules of

 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).

 Shareholder letter
 Stobart Group advises that a letter will be dispatched to shareholders shortly, a copy of which is set 
out below.
 Shareholder letter
 Dear Stobart Group shareholder,
 I am writing to provide you with further information in relation to the actions which the Company has 
been obliged to take in order to protect the interests of all shareholders.
 There are a number of key points to bring to your attention:
 --     Stobart Group is changing from a collection of emerging businesses into a more tightly focused 
group. The building blocks are in place for the main drivers of value, the Aviation and Energy divisions, 
to generate operating profit and cash and create significant value for all shareholders.
 --     The announcement on 13 June 2018 by Ryanair that it would be delivering an additional one million 
passengers to London Southend Airport from next year onwards is ample testament to that.
 --     This evolution requires a different management style to the entrepreneurial approach which 
nurtured the original business initiatives. It demands consistent strategy, professional management and 
accountability, all supported by an independent board that protects the interests of all shareholders and 
facilitates delivery of the long-term success of the Company.
 --     Andrew Tinkler's move to oust the Chairman and replace him with his own nominee ran totally 
counter to this. It is his right as a shareholder to propose a change.  However, his wider actions, 
particularly in writing to all employees, have now threatened to destabilise the Company and have put at 
risk the interests of all shareholders.
 --     This is why the Company had no alternative other than to dismiss him yesterday.
 --     Our Chief Executive and his management team are highly experienced in growing businesses and 
delivering value to all shareholders.  They need to be able to do so against a background of stability 
supported by an independent board.
 This is why it is so important that you support the re-election of Iain Ferguson as a Director.
 Background
Stobart Group Limited Shareholder letter
 On 25 May 2018, the Company announced that the Board had been advised by Andrew Tinkler, Executive 
Director, that he would be voting, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company, against the 
re-election of Iain Ferguson, as a Director and Chairman of the Company. The Company also announced that 
all other Directors offering themselves for election or re-election at the AGM had full confidence in Iain 
Ferguson, both as a Director and as Chairman, and would therefore be recommending to shareholders that 
they vote in favour of Iain Ferguson's re-election. Invesco Asset Management Limited, acting as agent for 
and on behalf of its discretionary managed clients, the Company's largest shareholder, also affirmed its 
support for Iain Ferguson.
 I would like to set out the background to this very regrettable situation, and the reasons I would urge 
you to vote in favour of Iain's re-election.
 Five years ago, we listened to our shareholders when they said they wanted Stobart Group to commit to a 
focused strategy alongside the highest standards of corporate governance to improve shareholder returns 
for the long-term.
 Stobart Group committed to doing this and has reaped the benefits ever since. We appointed Iain Ferguson 
as Chairman and Andrew Wood, John Coombs and John Garbutt as Non-Executive Directors. They brought 
challenge, scrutiny and robust debate to our boardroom along with relevant, valuable experience.
 When Andrew Tinkler advised the Board that he wanted to step down from his role as Chief Executive, we 
were delighted to welcome Warwick Brady, who was Andrew Tinkler's choice as his successor. Since his 
appointment, first as Deputy Chief Executive in January 2017 and then as Chief Executive in July 2017, 
Warwick has brought deep industry expertise and experience to the Group that is well aligned with our 
strategy.
 His strong management capabilities will help drive continued growth across the Company, and his aviation 
industry knowledge will be critical in realising the significant value we see in this area of the 
business. He has already demonstrated his ability to make a difference, with passenger numbers at London 
Southend Airport up 30% in FY 2017/18 even before this week's exciting announcement that Ryanair is to 
base three planes at London Southend Airport from next Summer.
 This agreement is expected to generate a further one million passengers per annum, doubling the airport's 
passenger numbers, and is testament to the aviation sector skills and contacts that Warwick has brought to 
the role and the hard work of his management team.
 Stobart Group now has the framework within which to pursue a focused and ambitious strategy to double the 
value of the business by 2022, and we firmly believe we have the right team in place to work toward our 
goals to welcome five million passengers annually at London Southend Airport, deliver three million tonnes 
of biomass each year and secure even more third party civil engineering contracts by that time.
 Andrew Tinkler
 We therefore deeply regret that Andrew Tinkler chose to destabilise the Group at this crucial time 
through his stated intention to vote against the Chairman at the AGM.   Andrew Tinkler has written to the 
Company's major shareholders and we enclose a copy of his letter in the interests of equality of 
information for all shareholders.
 We were disappointed further that he subsequently wrote to all of the Group's employees which generated 
even further instability. This followed a significant number of other serious actions in respect of which 
the Company will be issuing proceedings. His behaviour threatened to destabilise the Company and severely 
impacted on the ability of the Chief Executive and the management team to manage the business on a day-to-
day basis and deliver the agreed strategy.
 This was unfair on our employees and against the interests of all of our shareholders. Therefore, so as 
to bring order back to the Company for the benefit of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, 
Stobart Group summarily terminated his employment with immediate effect on 14 June and will today 
separately launch proceedings in the High Court to seek damages from him for, amongst other matters, 
breaches of contractual and fiduciary duties
 The Board is deeply saddened that the Company has been obliged to take such action.  Andrew Tinkler had 
contributed greatly to the Group and the Board acknowledges his entrepreneurial flair and transactional 
skills. However, his behaviour was jeopardising the future success of the Group and the Board would have 
been derelict in its duties not to have acted decisively to preserve shareholder value. The Board is 
acutely focused on its duty to act in the best interests of the Company, including for the benefit of all 
shareholders.  We feel Andrew Tinkler has failed in this duty.
 The current situation
 Andrew Tinkler's letter sets out a version of the Company's recent history with which the Board 
fundamentally disagrees. I do not intend to respond to this point by point. However, the Board is firmly 
of the view that Andrew Tinkler's letter does not accurately reflect the course of recent events that led 
to the matter becoming public or the Board's stance on Group strategy. As set out above and demonstrated 
by the Ryanair announcement, we have the right team and strategy in place to continue to deliver 
significant value to you as shareholders.
Stobart Group Limited Shareholder letter
 The current Non-Executive team was established at the request of shareholders to bring order to the 
Company's governance which had been riven with related party transactions and board changes.  Harnessing 
an entrepreneurial spirit is never easy but much, until recent events, had been achieved and the 
transition towards a more stable professional management team was well underway.
 As part of this transition, the Board had even agreed to the request from Andrew Tinkler to step down as 
Chief Executive but to retain a part-time role as Executive Director and bring his entrepreneurial skills 
to the benefit of the Group through the establishment of Stobart Capital, an advisory entity outside the 
Group which would offer investment opportunities back to the Group.  Unfortunately, Andrew Tinkler is in 
dispute with the co-founder of that business and Stobart Capital has not generated any significant 
transactions for the Group.
 Shareholders should be aware that the Board has been forced to face a number of challenges posed by 
Andrew Tinkler, particularly in the recent past:
 --     settlement of contractual issues arising from a previous related party transaction when Andrew 
Tinkler was Chief Executive and which are now subject to a separate High Court action taken against him by 
the Company;
 --     a proposed selective buy-back of part of his stake in the Company;
 --     a proposed additional ex-gratia bonus for him of shares then worth some GBP8m;
 --     a proposed buy-out of the Company when the share price was in the range of 100p to 120p; and
 --     a proposed related party transaction associated with the recent aborted airline transaction.
 Throughout these difficulties, the Board sought to manage such matters privately and had successfully 
achieved this over many months. However, earlier this year and after he had indicated to the Board that he 
wished to step down fully from the Board to pursue his own interests, he began agitating amongst certain 
major shareholders for the Chairman to step down.

 This resulted in the delivery by him to the Board of letters supporting his position from two other large 
shareholders; at this point the Board had no option other than to comply with its obligations as the board 
of a listed company and announce this to the market on 25 May 2018.  Bringing this matter into the public 
arena was a direct consequence of Andrew Tinkler's actions and is deeply regrettable. On 29 May 2018, the 
Company issued a further announcement setting out the background to the situation in order that all 
shareholders were properly informed.
 Andrew Tinkler then nominated Philip Day as a Non-Executive Director with the desire that he should also 
be appointed Chairman. In order that the Nominations Committee could make a recommendation to shareholders 
in respect of such appointment, the Board has contacted Philip Day to confirm his willingness to stand and 
to understand his qualifications for the job.  From public sources, Philip Day's successful business 
background appears focused within unlisted companies in the retail sector and he has no experience of 
chairing a listed public company.
 The Nominations Committee will also wish to establish Philip Day's independence from Andrew Tinkler and 
other major shareholders in order that he is able to ensure, were he to be elected, that the interests of 
all shareholders are properly protected.  Public sources show that he is a near-neighbour in Cumbria of 
Andrew Tinkler, whose private helicopter business operates Philip Day's helicopter.
 In the proposed related party transaction associated with the recent aborted airline deal referred to 
above, Philip Day was one of the three intended co-investors alongside Andrew Tinkler and Woodford 
Investment Management (WIM). WIM is one of the two shareholders who are supporting Andrew Tinkler's move 
to oust the Chairman.
 The Board is concerned that Andrew Tinkler and his supporters are seeking to put themselves in a position 
to take control of the Group against the interests of all shareholders.
 Andrew Tinkler has also sought to disparage the Group's pursuit of its agreed strategy which is 
inconsistent with the facts; he and Warwick Brady designed the strategy which was endorsed by the whole 
Board including him.
 The execution of the strategy for the two key operating units has now passed from him to dedicated 
professional divisional management under the leadership of Warwick Brady. The recent Ryanair announcement 
provides further evidence of the successful execution of this strategy after many years of failing to 
secure further airline interest at London Southend Airport under his leadership.
 The Board and its brokers will work constructively with all shareholders going forward in order to 
develop the Company's share register to contain additional long-term shareholders who are excited by the 
value creation opportunity that the Company represents. It has already been contacted by one such party 
Stobart Group Limited Shareholder letter -2-
interested in making a significant investment in the Company and it would look to take this and similar 
ideas forward with existing shareholders, including Andrew Tinkler, in due course.
 Re-election of Iain Ferguson
 We are therefore urging all shareholders to support the re-election of Iain Ferguson at the AGM on 6 July 
because we believe anything else would:
 --     Dilute the robustness and the diversity of opinion on the Board, which contains strong, varied 
expertise drawn from experience working with leading public and private companies;
 --     Significantly impact the Group's planned growth strategy and its ability to optimise shareholder 
returns;  and
 --     Create instability. The Board had worked together effectively to provide a strong basis for 
growth, which is reflected in the Company's successful performance over the last five years. During Iain 
Ferguson's chairmanship both Andrew Tinkler and Warwick Brady have benefitted from a stable platform that 
has allowed the Company to deliver a total shareholder return of 185% in the three years to 28 February 
2018 and provide GBP74.1m to shareholders through dividends and buy-backs in the financial year ended 28 
February 2018.
 In contrast, supporting our Chairman would:
 --     Avoid significant Board resignations, both Executive and Non-Executive;
 --     Remove the risk of further operational management destabilisation and distraction, allowing us to 
focus on delivering our agreed strategy;
 --     Allow us maintain the highest standards of corporate governance to ensure the interests of all 
shareholders are protected;
 --     Reduce the risk to shareholder value; and
 --     Avoid sponsor and independent broker resignation.
 Conclusion
 In summary, Stobart Group needs to allow the current professional management team to implement its 
strategy to double the value of the business by 2022 for the benefit of all shareholders.
 The management team can only operate effectively within a stable framework of strong corporate governance 
focused on protecting the interests of all shareholders. That is why it is vital that shareholders support 
Iain Ferguson in the upcoming AGM.
 Yours faithfully,
 Andrew Wood

 Appendix
 Letter from Andrew Tinkler, Executive Director and Shareholder of Stobart Group Limited
 8th June 2018
 Dear Shareholder
 Stobart Group Limited (the "Company"): Annual General Meeting convened for 6 July 2018 (the "AGM")
 I am writing to you in my capacity as an Executive Director, significant shareholder and founder of the 
Company. I have been horrified, as I am sure you have been, as an investor in the Company, by recent 
announcements issued and action taken in the name of the Company, and by the public mud-slinging in which 
some of my fellow directors have seen fit to engage without any regard for the waste of the Company's 
resources involved or the impact on employees, customers and suppliers. I believe change is required, and 
that the Company needs a new Chairman to help bring that about. I am therefore writing to you to urge you 
to cast your vote at the AGM against the re-election of Mr Iain Ferguson, the Company's current Chairman, 
as a director of the Company.
 I would also urge you to vote for the election of Mr Philip Day as a director of the Company, as and when 
that resolution is put to shareholders. I had asked for that resolution to be put to you so that you could 
vote on it at the AGM, but Mr Ferguson and others on the board chose to deprive you of the opportunity to 
do so, and instead to defer the consideration of the resolution to appoint Mr Day as a director, and 
prospectively as Chairman of the Company, until some time after the AGM, notwithstanding the extra costs 
which the Company will incur in convening a separate general meeting for this purpose and the uncertainty 
this will create.
 I do not propose to go through the entire history of the matter in this letter. However, my concerns date 
back to last year and reached a critical point in early 2018 when I became aware that Mr Ferguson, without 
any discussion or consultation with shareholders, was attempting to remove me from the Board.
Stobart Group Limited Shareholder letter -2-
 It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement amongst the directors of the Company over the 
implementation of the future strategy of the Stobart Group.  My objective in all my dealings has been to 
ensure that the Company pursues the agreed strategy and does not deviate from this, as pursuing the agreed 
strategy will deliver the best returns for shareholders.  That strategy is best executed and underpinned 
by strong corporate governance, which has been sadly lacking of late, and that is why, in my view and that 
of a number of other significant shareholders, it is in the best interests of the Company that Mr Ferguson 
should not be re-elected as a director, and that Mr Day should be appointed as a director and should take 
Mr Ferguson's place as Chairman of the Company.
 Philip Day is a well-known and highly successful businessman.  I believe he will provide strong 
leadership and stability to the Company, and help drive forward the Company's strategy. Philip will form a 
relevant, independent and robust board of directors which is more appropriate for the future development 
of Stobart Group and with the skill set to deliver future strategy.
 Recent announcements issued
 Prior to the convening of the AGM, and in an effort to resolve matters privately, I and a number of other 
significant shareholders approached Mr Ferguson and indicated to him that, in our view, it was in the best 
interests of the Company that he should step down as a director and as Chairman of the Company at the AGM. 
Mr Ferguson resisted any suggestion that he should resign and decided, with the support of certain other 
directors, to make the disagreement public, rather than allowing time for discussions to continue in 
private and for proper soundings to be taken from the Company's shareholders. Notwithstanding my efforts 
to prevent it, the board insisted on releasing an announcement, after the market had closed on the Friday 
immediately prior to the bank holiday weekend, highlighting the disagreement and stating Mr Ferguson's 
intention to put himself forward for re-election at the AGM and the intention of Mr Wood and Mr Coombs to 
step down if shareholders were to vote against Mr Ferguson's re-election.

 RYANAIR CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION TO PREVENT MELTDOWN OF EUROPE'S AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC)
 ATC STAFF SHORTAGES/STRIKES CRISIS IS DISRUPTING MILLIONS OF PASSENGERS THIS SUMMER
 Ryanair, Europe's largest airline, today (14 June) called for urgent action by the EU Commission and 
European Governments to arrest the alarming deterioration in Europe's ATC services during the months of 
May and June, and prevent a full meltdown of ATC services this summer.
 In May 2018:
 --     Over 117,000 flights were delayed with 61% (over 71,000 flights) due to ATC staff shortages and 
strikes.
 --     Over 56,000 flights were delayed more than 15 minutes, a fourfold increase on the 14,000 flights 
delayed more than 15 minutes in May 2017.
 --     Weather delays accounted for 39% (45,000 flights), a fourfold increase in the 11,000 weather 
delays of May 2017.
 --     Strangely, a majority (almost 60%) of these weather delays took place on Fridays and Saturdays 
rather than the other 5 days of the week, which suggests that ATC providers are using adverse weather to 
cover their staff shortages.
 --     The EU target delay for 2018 is an average of 0.5 minutes per flight. However, the current 
forecast for 2018 is now heading towards 1.5 minutes per flight, nearly treble the EU target.
 --     In May, Ryanair cancelled just over 1,000 flights, almost all due to ATC staff shortages and 
strikes. This was 24 times the 43 flights cancelled in May 2017.
 --     In May, EasyJet cancelled 974 flights compared to just 117 in May 2017.
 --     In May, IAG CEO Willie Walsh said: "The thing most impacted is ATC strikes and the ongoing ATC 
environment, which is a mess. It is destroying traffic throughout Europe. We thought it would get better 
in 2018 but it's getting worse".
 Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
 "Yet again this weekend, French ATC will strike on Saturday and Sunday leading to hundreds of flights 
being cancelled, disrupting the holiday plans of thousands of passengers. Many of these flights don't even 
touch France, yet they will be disruptive because French ATC requires airlines to cancel overflights while 
they 
protect 
French 
domestic 
routes. 
Europe's 
airlines 
are 
also 
suffering 
thousands 
of 
ATC 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR CALLS FOR ACTION TO PREVENT ATC MELTDOWN
delays/cancellations because of staff shortages especially in German and UK ATC providers. These 
disruptions are unacceptable, and we call on the UK and German Governments, and the EU Commission to take 
urgent and decisive action to ensure that ATC providers are fully staffed and that overflights are not 
affected when national strikes take place, as they repeatedly do in France.
 Europe's ATC providers are approaching the point of meltdown with hundreds of flights being cancelled 
daily simply because they don't have enough staff to deal with them. The situation is particularly acute 
at weekends where British and German ATC providers are hiding behind adverse weather and euphemisms such 
as "capacity restrictions" when the truth is they are not rostering enough ATC staff to cater for the 
number of flights that are scheduled to operate.
 Urgent action must now be taken by the UK and German Governments, and the EU Commission, otherwise 
thousands more flights and millions of passengers will be disrupted, particularly in the peak months of 
July and August, unless this ATC staffing crisis is addressed".

 London Southend Airport announces five-year agreement with Ryanair
 Stobart Group, which invests in, owns and operates infrastructure assets, is pleased to announce a new 
partnership with leading low-cost airline Ryanair, listed on the London Stock Exchange as Ryanair Holdings plc.
 This five-year agreement, extendable to ten, and agreed on our standard commercial terms, will see Ryanair make 
a $300 million investment by opening a new base at London Southend Airport. As a result, Ryanair will operate 
three planes out of Stobart Group's London Southend Airport from Summer 2019, providing 13 routes to eight 
European countries, and will include six new destinations.
 Destinations will include Alicante, Barcelona Reus, Bilbao, Brest, Corfu, Cluj, Dublin, Faro, Kosice, Malaga, Milan 
Bergamo, Palma and Venice.
 Ryanair will operate over 55 weekly flights, creating 750 "on-site" jobs per year. This agreement will enable the 
airport to welcome at least one million additional passengers in the first year and in excess of five million in the first 
five years.
 David O'Brien, Chief Commercial Officer of Ryanair, said: "We are pleased to add London Southend Airport to our

 Warwick Brady, CEO of Stobart Group, said: "We are delighted to welcome Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, and 
its customers to London Southend Airport. It is now the UK's fasting growing airport following a 29% increase in 
passenger numbers over the last year.
 "Passengers are increasingly turning to London Southend Airport amid the capacity crisis found elsewhere in the 
capital, where holidaymakers and business travellers face frustration from overcrowded airports.
 "In contrast, London Southend Airport offers an excellent, efficient passenger experience, and we are delighted 
that this is becoming increasingly recognised, demonstrated by the tremendous momentum within our Aviation 
division.
 "We have a clear and focused strategy to grow our airport in order to welcome five million passengers a year by 
2022. This long-term partnership agreement with a leading airline such as Ryanair will help us achieve that aim. 
Since joining Stobart Group over 12 months ago I have been working closely alongside the team at London

 RYANAIR RECOGNISES UNITE UNION FOR UK BASED CABIN CREW
 UK ACCOUNTS FOR 25% OF RYANAIR'S FLEET
 Ryanair today (11 June) announced that it has signed its second cabin crew union recognition agreement with 
Unite the Union, who will now be the representative body for Ryanair directly employed cabin crew in the UK. This 
agreement follows Ryanair's first cabin crew recognition deal with the Italian ANPAC/ANPAV unions.
 This cabin crew recognition agreement follows extensive negotiations with Unite the Union and covers the UK 
market, which accounts for approx. 25% of Ryanair's fleet. Ryanair looks forward to working with Unite the Union 
and its Ryanair (Cabin Crew) Company Council to conclude an early CLA for Ryanair's directly employed cabin 
crew based in the UK.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said:
 "We are pleased to sign this cabin crew recognition agreement with Unite the Union in the U.K. This is a further 
sign of the progress Ryanair is making with trade unions since our December 2017 decision to recognise them. We 
hope to announce further agreements over the coming weeks, in those countries where unions have approached 
these negotiations in a practical and positive manner. We are making less progress in some smaller countries 
where minor issues (such as days off for union officials) are unnecessarily delaying agreements.
 However, as this growing number of pilot and cabin crew recognition agreements confirms, we are making 
progress and confounding those sceptics who claimed that our December 2017 decision was not real or genuine. 
We look forward to working closely with both Unite the Union, and their Company Council to address issues of 
concern to our UK based cabin crew."

 RYANAIR, ANPAC & ANPAV SIGN FIRST RECOGNITION AGREEMENT FOR ITALIAN BASED CABIN CREW
 Ryanair today (6 June) confirmed that it has signed its first cabin crew union recognition agreement with ANPAC 
and ANPAV, who will be the representative body for Ryanair directly employed cabin crew in Italy. This agreement 
follows extensive negotiations with ANPAC and ANPAV since Ryanair's December 2017 announcement that it was 
willing to recognise Unions for collective bargaining purposes.
 Ryanair welcomes the constructive engagement of ANPAC and ANPAV which led to the signing of this first cabin 
crew recognition agreement, in Italy, which currently accounts for over 80 of Ryanair's 400+ aircraft fleet and 
approx. 20% of Ryanair's cabin crew. Ryanair looks forward to working with ANPAC and ANPAV and its newly 
elected Ryanair (Cabin Crew) Company Council to conclude an early CLA for our directly employed cabin crew 
based in Italy.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said:
 "We are pleased to announce this recognition agreement with ANPAC and ANPAV on behalf of our directly 
employed cabin crew in Italy. This is our first cabin crew union recognition agreement (which follows recognition 
agreements with pilot unions in the UK and Italy earlier this year) and further demonstrates Ryanair's progress on 
recognising and negotiating with unions across Europe for our people. We are making good progress with other 
cabin crew unions across Europe and we hope to sign more recognition agreements with both pilot and cabin crew 
unions in the coming weeks."

 LOAD FACTOR RISES 1% TO 96% ON LOWER FARES
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (5 June) released May traffic statistics as follows:
 --    Traffic grew 6% to 12.5m customers
 --    Load factor rose 1% to 96%
 --    Rolling annual traffic to May grew 8% to 132.1m customers
 --    ATC strikes and staff shortages cause cancellation of over 1,100 flights in May 18 vs. 43 in May 17

 -------  -------  -------
Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's May traffic grew by 6% to 12.5m customers, while our load factor rose 1% to
 96%, on the back of lower fares.
 Regrettably over 200,000 Ryanair customers had their flights cancelled in May because of ATC strikes (mostly 
French), ATC staff shortages and thunderstorms. Ryanair calls for immediate EU Commission action to prevent 
more ATC strikes and staff shortages disrupting the travel plans of Europe's consumers this summer."

Expanding Network
 While we remain the market leader in CEE, during 2018, we also continued to grow outside CEE.  Our first 
Western European base opened at London Luton in June 2017 and, shortly afterwards, our entrepreneurial spirit 
and agility as a business allowed us to secure additional slots and parking stands at London Luton airport and grow 
that base quickly. By the end of FY2018, our network from London Luton airport consisted of 46 routes, flying to 20 
countries and offering 6.9 million seats to customers.  In response to the uncertainty created by Brexit, we put in 
place one of the pillars of our contingency plan with the establishment of Wizz Air UK Limited, a UK-licensed airline 
which, by the end of June 2018, will be operating 8 aircraft.  Later in the financial year, we were also able to take 
advantage of a market opportunity in Vienna, and announced the establishment of our second Western European 
base which will start operations in June 2018.
 As at today, Wizz Air offers services from 21 CEE countries including the 14 CEE countries where we have based 
aircraft and crews. During the year the Company started operations to/from 12 new airports, as follows:

Fleet development
 During the 2018 financial year, we continued to invest significantly in our fleet by adding ten A321ceo and four 
A320ceo aircraft, taking our fleet to 93 aircraft at the end of March 2018. Deliveries of the A321ceo aircraft 
commenced in November 2015 and in just 30 months we are already operating 26 of the type representing 33 per 
Wizz Air Holdings PLC Final Results -3-
cent. of the Company's total seat capacity. We are excited about the cost savings we are seeing from the A321ceo 
aircraft, and the continued roll-out of these aircraft across our network is expected to further improve our cost base 
and competitive edge.
 The composition of our fleet at the end of the 2018 financial year and currently anticipated at the end of the next 
two financial years is as follows:

Aircraft Orders
 In FY 2016 the Company concluded a purchase agreement with Airbus for 110 firm-order A321neo aircraft and 
purchase rights for a further 90 of the type. During the 2017 financial year the Company selected and contracted 
Pratt & Whitney's new technology geared turbofan engines to power these aircraft. The purchase agreement 
includes uncommitted purchase rights for 75 additional A321neo aircraft as well as ample flexibility with conversion 
and deferral rights.
 Complementing the above transaction, during FY 2018 the Company signed two additional purchase agreements 
with Airbus. The first was for 10 A321ceo aircraft with deliveries in 2018 and 2019 calendar years responding to the 
ever-increasing demand for Wizz Air's low fares. The second and historic order at the end of 2017 was the 
Company's largest ever order of 146 A320neo family aircraft (72 A320neo and 74 A321neo), and as part of an 
airline group initiative, marked also Airbus' largest ever A320 family aircraft order of 430 units. This exceptional deal 
secures a continued stable flow of new aircraft starting from 2021 until 2026 at extremely competitive prices.
 We are convinced that the Airbus A320neo and A321neo are game-changer aircraft for Wizz Air, as we continue to 
grow at an industry-leading rate and expand our market reach across and beyond Europe. Wizz Air now has 256 
Airbus A320 family neo aircraft on order and these ultra-efficient, next-step technology aircraft will underpin our 
growth plans for the next decade as we continue with our mission to be the undisputed cost leader among 
European airlines.
 Based on the estimates of both Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, the A320neo Family will deliver significantly better fuel 
burn efficiency and even lower unit costs compared to the ceo version, making it the perfect aircraft to underpin the 
Company's ambitious growth plans and replace older aircraft as they are returned to lessors. The first A321neo is 
scheduled to be delivered in 2019 and deliveries will continue until the end of 2026.  Based on the current order 
book with Airbus, and lessor return schedule, the fleet will more than double in size from the end of FY 2017 to the 
end of FY 2024.
 Offering our customers more
 We know that our customers welcome the opportunity to fly at Wizz Air's lowest fares yet experience a high quality 
on-board service provided by our dedicated crew. We continue to challenge ourselves to make things easier for our 
customers, provide the widest choice of travel options fpr our customers and deliver a strong operational 
performance. Proving our commitment to finding innovative ways of enhancing the customer experience we 
introduced several new services in the 2018 financial year:

another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).

 RYANAIR FULL YEAR PROFITS RISE 10% TO EUR1.45BN
 LOWER FARES & HIGHER OIL CUTS FY19 GUIDANCE to EUR1.25BN - EUR1.35BN
 Ryanair today (21 May) reported a 10% increase in full year profit after tax to EUR1.45bn, as lower fares (down 
3%) stimulated 9% traffic growth to over 130m guests, and an industry leading 95% load factor.

Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
 "We are pleased to report a 10% increase in profits, with an unchanged net margin of 20%, despite a 3% 
cut in air fares, during a year of overcapacity in Europe, leading to a weaker fare environment, rising 
fuel prices, and the recovery from our Sept. 2017 rostering management failure. Highlights of the last 
year include:
 -     Traffic grew 9% to over 130m, despite grounding 25 winter aircraft
 -     Average fare fell 3% to just EUR39.40
 -     Unit costs were cut by 1% (ex-fuel they rose +3%)
 -     Ryanair Labs stimulated record ancillary spend (+4% per guest)
 -     We took delivery of 50 B737 aircraft, bringing the fleet to 430 units
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
 -     We created 1,500 new jobs, and over 600 promotions
 -     New 5 year pay deals were concluded with most of our pilots and cabin crew
 -     Over EUR800m was returned to shareholders via buybacks
 -     We recovered quickly from the Sept. 2017 pilot rostering failure
 Sales:
 Average fares last year declined by 3%, which was good news for our guests but bad news for competitors. 
Traffic grew 9% to over 130m with Germany, Italy and Spain being our 3 largest growth markets. We expect 
above average EU capacity growth to continue into FY19, which will have a downward effect on fares. This 
may be partly ameliorated by the switch of some charter capacity back to previously security challenged 
markets such as Turkey and Egypt. We expect later in the year, some upward pressure on pricing as 
significantly higher oil prices impact margins, especially those EU airlines who continue to expand 
despite having no prospect of achieving profitability. Ryanair will continue to pursue our load factor 
active/yield passive strategy. No other EU airline can compete with Ryanair's prices.
 During FY18 we took delivery of 50 new B737s, and increased our Boeing order to 135 firm MAX-200 
Gamechangers, with a further 75 under option (210 in total). We opened 4 bases in Burgas, Memmingen, 
Naples & Poznan and launched over 260 new routes. This summer, we have announced over 200 new routes 
including markets in Jordan, Turkey and the Ukraine. We continue to grow strongly in Germany, Italy and 
the UK, and our Polish charter airline, Ryanair Sun, operated its first flights in April 2018.
 Ancillaries, Labs & Customer Service:
 Ryanair Labs continues to deliver improvements in Customer Service, mobile & digital platforms, and our 
ancillary sales conversions. Labs has established 3 development offices in Dublin, Wroclaw, and Madrid, 
and employs almost 600 highly skilled digital professionals.
 "MyRyanair" membership has grown to 43m, while our website & app has over 1 billion visits p.a. Our 
improved mobile and digital platforms have delivered a 13% increase in ancillary revenues (+4% per guest) 
to over EUR2bn. Ancillaries now deliver 28% of revenue and we are well on track to achieve our 5 year goal 
of 30%. More guests are switching to our great value "plus" fares, reserved seating, priority boarding, 
and car hire. Ryanair Rooms penetration is rising steadily, albeit from a low base, as our guests 
recognise our unique combination of lowest hotel prices and travel credits.
 In the area of Customer Service, we have lowered our checked bag fees while increasing the bag allowance 
(to 20kg). Our amended 2 cabin bag policy (1 of which goes in the hold f.o.c. for non-priority guests) has 
improved boarding and punctuality, and we are expanding our offers in areas such as FastTrack, and ground 
transport connections. In March we launched our new environmental policy, which commits Ryanair to a 
series of industry leading environmental targets, including moving to "plastic free" within 5 years, while 
allowing our guests to contribute voluntarily to our carbon offset programme, the proceeds of which will 
be applied to support selected environmental projects.
 Over the last year our on-time performance has declined by 2% from 88% to 86%. All of this decline was 
accounted for by increased ATC delays due to strikes and staffing/capacity shortages mainly in France, 
Germany and Italy. The delivery of ATC services in Europe is lamentable and creating unacceptable delays 
for our customers. Punctuality in Q4 was negatively impacted by unusually adverse weather conditions, 
which led to multiple airport snow closures at key bases including Dublin and Stansted for a number of 
days in late February/early March. We are working hard to increase staffing at our larger bases, re-
designing boarding procedures, and providing additional spare aircraft in S.18 to improve our punctuality 
to our 90% target, which is a key AGB target for the coming year.
 Costs:
 Ryanair enjoys a significant cost advantage over all other EU airlines, and we expect this leadership to 
continue. In FY18, unit costs - helped by our fuel hedging - fell 1%. Even as traffic grew 9%, ex-fuel 
unit costs rose 3% mainly due to one-off EU261 costs arising from our Sept. 2017 cancellations, and higher 
H2 staff costs as we agreed substantial pay increases and 5 year pay deals with our pilots and cabin crew. 
We expect the market for experienced pilots in Europe to remain tight for the next 12 months, and 
accordingly, this will continue to put upward pressure on staff costs for all EU airlines.
 In FY19 we will invest substantially in our people, our systems, and our business as we scale up the 
operation to take delivery of 210 Boeing Gamechanger aircraft over the next 6 years. This will lead to a 
modest increase in ex-fuel unit costs next year but will underpin our growth to almost 600 aircraft and 
200m guests p.a. by FY24. We expect staff costs to rise by almost EUR200m, half of which is higher pay for 
our front line people and half is additional headcount for growth.
 Fuel will be a major cost headwind for the next 24 months. We are currently 90% hedged for FY19 at 
approx. pbl$58, which is well below current spot prices of almost pbl$80. While US Shale production 
remains strong, world demand for oil is growing, and a number of short term political factors in 
Venezuela, Libya and Iran, suggests that prices will continue to be elevated for the coming year. Air 
fares tend to follow oil prices (as they have downwards over the last 3 years) but with a lag of up to 12 
months before higher oil prices feed through to higher air fares. Accordingly, we expect unit costs over 
the next year to rise by 9% (ex-fuel they will increase by 6%). Thereafter, we expect the impact of the 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results
lower seat cost Boeing 737-MAX aircraft, our new lower cost 10 year engine maintenance agreement, as well 
as airport growth opportunities and the disposal of older aircraft, to deliver flat or slightly declining 
non-fuel unit costs.
 Labour Cost:
 While we have made a promising start in negotiations with pilot unions, including signed recognition 
agreements with BALPA (UK) and ANPAC (Italy), we are also making considerable progress with our cabin crew 
negotiations, most notably in the UK and Spain. We suffered a 1 day pilot strike in Germany (Dec. 2017), 
and 3 days of cabin crew strikes in Portugal (in March/April), but in all cases, the majority of our 
people continued to work normally so these strikes had minimal impact on our operations. Our combination 
of higher pay, improved rosters, and unmatched job security will, we believe, continue to make Ryanair an 
employer of choice in the EU airline sector. We're welcoming hundreds of new pilots and cabin crew to 
Ryanair this year, including many joiners from bankrupt airlines such as Monarch and Air Berlin among 
others. We will continue to deal openly and fairly with our people and their unions, but we will not make 
concessions on pay or productivity which threatens either our low cost model or our cost leadership in 
Europe.
 Consolidation:
 The industry in Europe continues to consolidate into 5 large airline groups. In the last year, Monarch 
went bust, Lufthansa acquired Air Berlin, and more recently IAG made an offer to acquire loss making 
Norwegian. During the period, Ryanair established a Polish charter airline, Ryanair Sun, which started 
flying in April and looks set to trade profitably in its first 12 months of operation. In April, we 
acquired 24.9% of LaudaMotion, and are working to increase that stake to 75% (subject to EU merger 
approval) so that we can work with Niki Lauda and his team to re-launch LaudaMotion as Austria's No.1 low 
fares airline, serving markets from Austria and Germany to sun destinations primarily in Spain. 
LaudaMotion is an attractive opportunity as it is an Airbus operator, and we are looking for opportunities 
to grow its Airbus fleet to 30-50 aircraft over the next 5 years. LaudaMotion has a valuable portfolio of 
slots at many congested airports in Germany, Vienna, and Palma de Mallorca.  We believe that by investing 
in these separate airlines, we can build a substantial and profitable group of EU airlines under the

 The following new and amended standards, have been issued by the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the

periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019)
 --    Amendments to IAS 28: "Long-term interests in Associates and Joint Ventures" (effective for fiscal 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019)*
 * These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed.
 IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 IFRS 15 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.  The standard establishes 
a five-step model to determine when to recognise revenue and at what amount.  Revenue is recognised when 
the good or service has been transferred to the customer and at the amount to which the entity expects to 
be entitled.
 Ryanair has reviewed the impact of applying IFRS 15 on all of its revenue streams.  For the majority of 
our revenue, the manner in which we currently recognise revenue is consistent with the requirements of 
IFRS 15.  For certain ancillary revenue streams however, the recognition of revenue will be deferred under 
IFRS 15 to the flight date where it is currently recognised on the date of booking.
 This change in the timing of revenue recognition will mean that an increased amount of revenue will be 
recognised in the first half of the year under IFRS 15, with less revenue recognised in the second half of 
the year, particularly in Quarter 4.
 Ryanair expects to apply the standard using the cumulative effect method.  On adoption of the standard, 
the adjustment to retained earnings at April 1, 2018 is expected to be a charge of between EUR250M and 
EUR300M. There will be a corresponding increase in unearned revenue within liabilities.
 IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
 IFRS 9 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018.  The standard introduces a 
new model for the classification and measurement of financial assets, a new impairment model based on 
expected credit losses and a new hedge accounting model to more closely align hedge accounting with risk 
management strategy and objectives.
 Financial assets, excluding derivatives, will be accounted for at amortised cost, fair value through 
other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss depending on the nature of the contractual 
cash flows of the asset and the business model in which it is held.  Ryanair has completed a review of its 
financial assets and is satisfied that all of them will continue to be held at amortised cost.  No 
material transition adjustment to carrying values is anticipated.
 Ryanair has reviewed the impact of applying the new expected loss impairment model to its financial 
assets. There will not be a material increase in provisions as a result of applying the new requirements.
 Ryanair does not expect any change from the hedge accounting provisions of IFRS 9.
 IFRS 16: Leases
 IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
 The standard is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption is 
permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date of 
initial application of IFRS 16.  Ryanair does not intend to early adopt IFRS 16.
 We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures but do not expect the impact to be material.
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements, the significant judgements 
made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation 
uncertainty were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial 
statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the year ended March 31, 2018

relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in the income 
statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR6.4M (March 31, 2017: EUR5.7M) is the fair value of 
various share options granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in 
accordance with employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At March 31, 2018 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 431 (2017: 383) Boeing 737 aircraft.  The Group 
agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY15 
to FY19 of which 154 aircraft (including 50 in the financial year) were delivered at March 31, 2018.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (110 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737-Max-200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24; these include 10 additional firm orders announced 
in June 2017 which will see aircraft deliveries increase by 5 in both spring 2019 and spring 2020.  This 
also includes a further 25 options that were converted to firm orders in April 2018 (See note 14 below).
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 MD&A for the Year Ended March 31, 2018
 Income Statement
 Scheduled revenues:
 Scheduled revenues increased by 5% to EUR5,134.0M due to 9% traffic growth (to 130.3M) offset by a 3% 
reduction in average fares to EUR39.40.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues rose by 13% to EUR2,017.0M due to 9% traffic growth and the higher uptake of reserved 
seating, priority boarding and car hire offset by lower travel insurance and hotels.
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil fell by 1% to EUR1,902.8M due to lower hedged fuel prices offset by a 10% increase in block 
hours.
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges rose 9% to EUR938.6M in line with the 9% increase in traffic growth.
 Route charges:
 Route charges rose 7% to EUR701.8M in line with a 7% increase in sectors.
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs increased 17% to EUR738.5M due to 10% more hours, pilot salary increases from October 2017 
and the impact of a 2% staff pay increase in April 2017 offset by weaker sterling.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation is 13% higher at EUR561.0M due to 50 (+14%) more owned aircraft in the fleet at year end 
(400 March 2018 vs 350 March 2017).
 Marketing, distribution and other:
 Marketing, distribution and other rose by 27% to EUR410.4M.  This includes EUR25M non-recurring EU261 
costs arising from September/October 2017 flight cancellations.  EU261 costs increased as passengers have 
a higher propensity to claim than in prior years.  Marketing costs are broadly flat (year on year) and 
distribution costs increased at a slower rate than the increase in onboard sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs rose by 5% to EUR148.3M, lower than the 9% increase in traffic, due to 
fewer leased aircraft in the fleet and the timing of checks.
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals fell by 4% to EUR82.3M due to the smaller leased fleet.
 Unit costs fell by 1% (excluding fuel they rose by 3%).
 Other income/(expense):
 Net finance expense:
 Net finance expense decreased by 8% to EUR58.1M primarily due to lower interest rates and repayments of 
debt.
 Balance sheet:
 Gross cash fell by EUR460.2M to EUR3,680.1M at March 31, 2018.
 Gross debt fell by EUR421.5M to EUR3,963.0M due to debt repayments.
 EUR2,233.2M net cash was generated by operating activities. Capital expenditure was EUR1,470.6M and 
shareholder returns amounted to EUR829.1M.
 Net debt was EUR282.9M at year end.  (March 2017: EUR244.2M).
 Shareholders' equity:
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -4-
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR45.9M to EUR4,468.9M in the year due to net profit after tax of 
EUR1,450.2M, offset by EUR829.1M of shareholder returns and IFRS hedge accounting treatment for 
derivatives of EUR581.6M.
 Earnings per share (EPS):
 Basic EPS increased by 15% to EUR1.2151 per share (2017: EUR1.0530 per share), ahead of the 10% increase 
in profit after tax. During the year the Company bought back and cancelled 46.7M ordinary shares at a 
total cost of EUR829.1M.

 Preliminary Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated preliminary financial statements of the Company for the year ended March 31, 2018 comprise 
the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated preliminary financial statements ("the preliminary financial 
statements"), which should be read in conjunction with our 2017 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 
2017, have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial 
Reporting" as adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full 
annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2017, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
 The March 31, 2018 figures and the March 31, 2017 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2017, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.

Body
 Holdings banner over the next 3 years, when it is likely that further M&A opportunities will arise. LaudaMotion will 
require almost EUR100m in start-up costs, and operating losses over the next 2 years in large measure due to 
expensive aircraft leases from Lufthansa. Once these leases expire, we expect LaudaMotion to be modestly 
profitable and self-sustaining as it grows its low fare offerings in Germany and Austria.
 Brexit:
 We remain concerned at the likely impact of a hard Brexit. While there is a general belief that an 18 month 
transition agreement from March 2019 to December 2020 will be implemented and further extended, it is in the best 
interest of our shareholders that we continue to plan for a hard Brexit in March 2019. In these circumstances, it is 
likely that our UK shareholders will be treated as non-EU and this could potentially affect Ryanair's licencing and 
flight rights. Accordingly, in line with our Articles, we intend to restrict the voting rights of all non-EU shareholders in 
the event of a hard Brexit, so that we can ensure that Ryanair is majority owned and controlled by EU shareholders 
at all times to comply with our licences. This would result in non-EU shareholders not being able to vote on 
shareholder resolutions. In the meantime, we have applied for a UK AOC which we hope to receive before the end 
of 2018.
 Balance Sheet & Cash:
 Ryanair's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry. At year end, our balance sheet included 400 
owned B737 aircraft, all of which were added at their net purchase price, which is a significant discount to their 
current market value. Ryanair continues to generate significant cash flows. In the past year, we generated over 
EUR2bn cash from operations. Despite capex of EUR1.5bn, and share buybacks of over EUR800m, year-end net 
debt at March 2018 was broadly flat at EUR283m. In Feb., the Board approved another EUR750m share buyback, 
which we expect to complete at the end of Oct. 2018. Including this buyback, Ryanair will have returned over 
EUR6bn to our shareholders since 2008. The success of our share buyback programme is demonstrated by our 
15% EPS growth in FY18 at a time when profits rose 10%.
 Outlook & Guidance
 Our Outlook for FY19 is on the pessimistic side of cautious. We expect to grow traffic by 7% to 139m, at flat load 
factors of 95%. Unit costs this year will rise 9% due to higher staff and oil prices which will, when adjusted for 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Final Results -2-
volume growth, add more than EUR400m to our fuel bill. Ex-fuel unit cost will rise by up to 6% as we annualise pilot 
and cabin crew pay increases, and invest in our business and our systems to facilitate a 6 year growth plan to 600 
aircraft and 200m guests p.a.
 We have limited H1 and zero H2 fare visibility. Forward bookings are strong but pricing remains soft. Since only 
half of Easter fell in April, we expect a 5% fare decline in Q1 but a 4% rise in Q2 fares. While still too early to 
accurately forecast close-in summer bookings or H2 fares, we are cautiously guiding broadly flat average fares for 
FY19. Ancillary revenues will grow as penetration of customer services continues to rise. We do not expect ancillary 
revenue growth to fully offset higher costs and lower fares, and so we expect FY19 profits will fall to a range of 
EUR1.25bn to EUR1.35bn. This guidance is heavily dependent on H2 fares, a "normal" level of ATC disruptions for 
S.18, the absence of unforeseen security events, and no negative Brexit developments during this period.
 We have not included our investment in LaudaMotion in the above outlook as any increase to a 75% share 
ownership remains subject to EU Competition approval. We expect approx. EUR100m of start-up costs, and 
operating losses for LaudaMotion if and or/when our proposal to take majority ownership receives regulatory 
approval."

replacement aircraft, costs associated with environmental, safety and security measures, actions of the Irish, U.K., 
European Union ("EU") and other governments and their respective regulatory agencies, uncertainties surrounding 
Brexit, weather related disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates, airport access and 
charges, labour relations, the economic environment of the airline industry, the general economic environment in

Body
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the 
CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made based on the 
entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in 
making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes 
within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Group for 
the year.  All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single reportable 
segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the 
Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Group's 
single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

Diluted earnings per share takes account of the potential future exercises of share options granted under 
the Company's share option schemes and the weighted average number of shares includes weighted average 
share options assumed to be converted of 10.5M (2017: 7.8M).
 10.          Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the year ended March 31, 2018 amounted to EUR1,470.6M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre delivery payments and 50 aircraft deliveries.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2017 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the year.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2018 has been used to 
establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting year during which the transfer occurred. During the year ended March 31, 2018, there were 
no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy 
used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments not measured at fair value
 --           Long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been discounted at 
the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at March 31, 2018 to arrive at 
a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the year ended March 
31, 2018 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

 Overview
 During the six months to 31 March 2018 easyJet delivered strong revenue and profit growth. This is 
primarily due to the positive trading environment developed as a result of the strength of its network, 
brand and customer proposition. As the oil price continues to rise, we expect financial pressure to 
increase on less efficient airlines. easyJet will continue to manage its own capacity growth plans to 
drive long-term returns.
 The airline's strategy will enable it to continue to be a structural winner within its chosen markets in 
the European short-haul market.
 Revenue
 Total revenue increased by 19.5% to GBP2,183 million (H1 2017: GBP1,827 million) and total revenue per 
seat grew by 10.9% to GBP54.10 (H1 2017: GBP48.80), reflecting a strong underlying revenue improvement as 
well as easyJet's acquisition of part of Air Berlin's operations at Berlin Tegel airport.
 Excluding Tegel operations, revenue per seat increased by 12% to GBP54.64 and by 9.5% at constant 
currency to GBP53.45. This was driven by:
 --     easyJet's growth in capacity by 4.6%, focused on growth in the French regions, further 
consolidating positions in core UK airports and continuing to grow our number one positions in Basel and 
Venice
 --     An increase of 1.7 percentage points  in load factor to 91.9%
 --     The benefit of lower market capacity, with the one-off events of bankruptcy at Monarch and Air 
Berlin and the winter withdrawal of Ryanair from the UK domestic market
 --     Seasonality - with the benefit of the partial movement of Easter to the second quarter of the 
financial year (an H1 impact of 1.6% on revenue per seat at constant currency)
 --     A strong performance on ancillary revenue per seat, increasing by 14.0% at constant currency, due 
mainly to further innovation and conversion uplift supported by digital acceleration. Specifically easyJet 
improved its bag proposition, introducing a new 15kg/23kg offering for our customers, smarter bag yield 
algorithms and further benefits from the Hands Free product
 --     A foreign currency revenue benefit from a stronger Euro against Sterling
 Cost
easyJet PLC Half-year Report - Replacement -2-
 Total headline cost per seat was broadly flat at GBP54.53 (H1 2017: GBP54.45) as the benefits of 
easyJet's cost focus and lower fuel price offset a negative foreign exchange impact. Headline cost per 
seat at constant currency improved by 1.5% to GBP53.64.
 Excluding Tegel operations easyJet's headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency increased 
by 1.3% to GBP42.74, higher than previously guided due to the impact of severe weather. This cost 
performance is driven by:
 --     Cost initiatives delivered GBP66 million in savings in the half, with the majority relating to 
airport charges, offsetting underlying inflation
 --     Lower navigation charges
 --     Up-gauging of fleet with the addition of 23 186-seat A320 aircraft  since 31 March 2017
 This has helped to offset:
 --     Disruption and de-icing costs that increased cost per seat by 0.5% at constant currency, due to 
prolonged severe weather throughout the period
 --     Inflationary cost pressures, including the impact of regulated airport charges, previously agreed 
crew pay deals and higher ground handling charges in a number of countries
 --     Additional ownership and financing costs that were anticipated following investment in the long-
term growth of the airline and the A319 sale and leaseback transaction
 --     Costs associated with higher load factor
 --     Investment in resilience, including the hiring of ex-Monarch crew and the investment in the new 
ground handling contract at Gatwick
 Tegel operations
 On 15 December 2017 easyJet completed the partial acquisition of Air Berlin's operations at Berlin Tegel 
airport. Progress to date has been positive and in line with expectations.
 easyJet's Tegel flying programme started on 5 January, operating a winter schedule with a fleet of mainly 
wet leased aircraft in order to retain its slot portfolio. As anticipated, in this start-up phase Tegel 
flying has resulted in lower than average load factors and revenue per seat due to the short lead times to 
sell flights and a mainly inherited schedule. Higher than normal cost per seat reflects the expensive 
nature of interim wet leasing arrangements whilst easyJet introduces its own fleet.

easyJet is also making good progress with its non-flying activities related to the transaction, mainly the 
recruitment and training of crew and the process of converting ex-Air Berlin aircraft into easyJet fleet. 
These costs are reported as non-headline and totalled GBP24 million in H1 2018. These costs are one-off in 
nature and no related costs are anticipated beyond this financial year.
 Non-headline costs
 easyJet has incurred GBP50 million in non-headline costs during the first half of FY 2018. These costs 
are separately disclosed as non-headline profit before tax items. The most significant items were as 
follows:
 --     GBP19 million non-cash charge as a result of the sale and leaseback of ten A319 aircraft in the 
first quarter (H1 2017: GBP16 million), which includes a GBP3 million adverse impact from foreign exchange 
movements
 --     GBP24 million charge associated with the integration costs of the Berlin Tegel operation (H1 2017: 
GBPnil), as noted above

 Non-headline items are material non-recurring items or are items which do not reflect the trading 
performance of the business. Further detail can be found in the notes to the accounts.
 Strategic progress
 Building on a strong foundation
 easyJet has a well-established business model that provides a strong foundation to drive profitable 
growth and long term shareholder returns. easyJet is delivering its strategy through:
 1.            A unique network
 2.            A structural cost advantage
 3.            Scale and a strong balance sheet
 4.            The best people
 5.            A strong brand
 6.            Data
 A unique network
 easyJet's strategy is focused on key airports, serving valuable catchment areas that represent Europe's 
top markets by GDP, driving both leisure and business travel.
 During H1 2018 easyJet focused its growth on maintaining market share in the UK and Switzerland and 
growing in regional France. This included the opening of a new base in Bordeaux, where easyJet is now the 
number one airline. easyJet also invested capacity growth in its city strategy: in Venice to consolidate 
its number one position, and in Amsterdam where the airport is now at full capacity. Further capacity 
growth was deployed in easyJet's lean bases to increase their scale and leverage their cost advantage. In 
March we closed our Hamburg base, transferring 85% of the workforce to other bases. easyJet now has 29 
bases across its network.
 Building on this network easyJet has seen excellent results from Worldwide by easyJet, its partnership 
with airlines and airports. Bookings to date have included over 2,700 unique origin and destination routes 
with Jersey, Chicago and Los Angeles the most popular origin markets. Volume continues to grow steadily 
and is now starting to benefit from the availability of new connections such as in Venice. Partner 
connections make up c.55% of Worldwide bookings with the remainder representing easyJet to easyJet 
connections at its primary airports.
 A structural cost advantage
 easyJet is committed to maintaining its structural cost advantage in the markets where it operates, 
primarily against the legacy airlines. Through its cost focus easyJet continues to identify both short-
term efficiencies and longer term structural cost savings, leveraging its increasing scale. These savings 
enable the airline to offset the effects of underlying inflation, keep fares low for our customers and 
address disruption costs.
 easyJet achieves this through dedicated work streams covering areas such as process improvement, supplier 
relationship management, use of data, reducing bureaucracy and investment into future technology. These 
are combined with a number of strategic cost initiatives, such as the fleet investment programme including 
up-gauging and cost efficiency from A320 and A321 NEOs as well as our recent organisational review and 
predictive maintenance.
 easyJet has achieved sustainable cost savings of over GBP450 million in the last seven years, with GBP66 
million saved in H1 2018.
 Scale and a strong balance sheet
 easyJet has almost 300 aircraft and is set to carry over 90 million customers this year. As well as being 
a large airline it is a relatively simple one - with one aircraft type, one brand, and one main 
distribution channel. This means it can leverage scale across the company. As it grows, easyJet's strategy 
is to drive out complexity and keep its focus on simplicity and efficiency.

slightly to 7.0 years (30 September 2017: 7.1 years).  In the first half easyJet's asset utilisation 
across the network reduced to an average 9.7 block hours per day when compared to H1 2017 (10.0 hours), 
partly impacted by the severe weather disruption in March.

 If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability might be categorised in different 
levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the 
same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire 
measurement. The fair values noted above are approximates of the carrying amounts of the instruments There 
is no difference between the carrying value and fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
receivables and trade and other payables.
 9. Provision
 On 2 October 2017, Monarch announced that it had ceased trading and entered administration. At the year 
ended 30 September 2017, the Group recognised a provision of GBP7,000,000. The amount recognised 
represented the cost the Group incurred to fulfil its obligations to customers under the ATOL regulations 
to arrange refunds or alternative flights. At the interim reporting date the full provision has been 
utilised. No further costs are expected.
 Further, through chargebacks and holding Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance ('SAFI'), the Directors 
considered part of the provision could be mitigated and accordingly a GBP5,000,000 receivable relating to 
the amounts expected to be reclaimed from either chargebacks or insurance was recognised. The GBP5,000,000 
receivable was recovered via chargebacks in March 2018.
 10. Principal risks and uncertainties
 There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have a material impact on the 
Company's performance over the remaining six months of the financial year and could cause actual results 
to differ materially from expected and historical results. The directors do not consider that the 
principal risks and uncertainties have changed since the publication of the Annual Report for the year 
ended 30 September 2017. These risks and how the Company seeks to mitigate these risks are set out on 
pages 17 to 25 of the 2017 Annual Report and Accounts which can be found at www.onthebeachgroupplc.com. 
The Group is one of several online travel agents involved in litigation with Ryanair in connection with 
Ryanair's efforts to prevent OTAs from booking and selling its flights. The legal process is ongoing but 
remains at an early stage. The position remains as disclosed in our Prospectus, save that (with regard to 
paragraph 13.6 on page 185), OTB issued a motion to compel delivery of full and proper particulars in May 
2017 and in response to this motion, Ryanair is proposing to make amendments to its original statement of 
claim. This has resulted in a further delay to the anticipated timescales set out in the Prospectus. 
Litigation is unpredictable and if Ryanair were to prevail, this could have a material impact on the 
Group's business.
 RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT
On the Beach Group PLC INTERIM RESULTS -8-
 We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 --      The condensed set of financial statements has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim 
Financial Reporting' as adopted by the EU; and The interim management report includes a fair review of the 
information required by DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, being an indication 
of important events that have occurred during the first 6 months of the current financial year and their 
impact on the condensed set of financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and
 --      The interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R of 
the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, being related party transactions that have taken place in 
the first six months the current financial year and that have materially affected the financial position 
or performance of the entity during that period, and any changes in the related party transactions 
described in the last annual report that could do so.
 This responsibility statement was approved by the Board on 9 May 2018 and is signed on its behalf by:
 Paul Meehan
 CFO

 INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO ON THE BEACH GROUP PLC
 Conclusion
 We have been engaged by the company to review the condensed set of financial statements in the half-
yearly financial report for the six months ended 31 March 2018 which comprises the condensed consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows and the 
statement of financial position and the related explanatory notes.
 Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set 
of financial statements in the half-yearly financial report for the six months ended 31 March 2018 is not 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by 
the EU and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules ("the DTR") of the UK's Financial Conduct 
Authority ("the UK FCA").
 Scope of review
 We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 
2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by 
the Auditing Practices Board for use in the UK.  A review of interim financial information consists of 
making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying 
analytical and other review procedures.  We read the other information contained in the half-yearly 
financial report and consider whether it contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the information in the condensed set of financial statements.
 A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become 
aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.  Accordingly, we do not express an 
audit opinion.
 Directors' responsibilities
 The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors.  The 
directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the DTR of the 
UK FCA.
 As disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the group are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.  The directors are responsible for 
preparing the condensed set of financial statements included in the half-yearly financial report in 
accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU.
 Our responsibility
 Our responsibility is to express to the company a conclusion on the condensed set of financial statements 
in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
 The purpose of our review work and to whom we owe our responsibilities
 This report is made solely to the company in accordance with the terms of our engagement to assist the 
company in meeting the requirements of the DTR of the UK FCA.  Our review has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the company those matters we are required to state to it in this report and for no other 
purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company for our review work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have reached.

 RYANAIR SMASHES 1 BILLION PLATORM VISITS A YEAR
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 airline, today (9 May) announced it smashed 1 billion platform visits per year 
(April 2017 to March 2018) for the first time in its history. This new 1,000,000,000 visitor record 
(website and app combined) is more visits than Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, KLM and Iberia 
combined, and demonstrates that Ryanair's website and app are the go-to platforms for customers searching 
and booking the lowest fares, thanks to the continuing success of the "Always Getting Better" customer 
experience programme.
 The figures have been independently verified by SimilarWeb and show that Ryanair's platform received:
 --     More visits than Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, KLM and Iberia combined
 --     More visits than Gap, Sky News, Tesco & Victoria's Secret
 --     6 times the visits of Man United, the world's most visited football club site
 --     22 visits per second
 --     The most visits in order of market: 1. UK 2. Italy 3. Spain 4. Germany 5. Ireland
 Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "We are delighted to reach this milestone of 1 billion visits in a year, the equivalent of nearly every 
man, woman and child in Europe and the USA visiting Ryanair's platforms, as consumers demonstrate they 
know exactly where to go for the lowest fares in Europe. Ryanair.com is the world's most visited airline 
website and the Ryanair app is the most used travel app in Europe, and we are continuing to enhance and 
improve our digital offering and customer experience through Ryanair Labs.
 We thank all of our visitors and are celebrating our billion visits with a 'Thanks a Billion' flash sale, 
with seats on the Ryanair.com website and app available from just EUR19.99, which must be booked before 
midnight (24:00hrs) on Friday (11 May). Since these amazing low prices will be snapped up quickly, 
customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and avoid missing out."

 RYANAIR EXERCISES 25 BOEING-MAX-200 OPTIONS
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (24 Apr) announced the exercise of 25 Boeing 737 MAX 200 "Gamechanger" 
aircraft options, bringing its total firm orders for this aircraft to 135, the first of which come onstream in the first half 
of 2019.
 These aircraft, which are valued at more than $3 billion at current list prices, increase Ryanair's total orders to 
more than 650 Boeing 737's since first partnering with Boeing in 1994, and allows Ryanair to grow its traffic to 
200m customers p.a. by 2024.
 Ryanair operates an all-Boeing fleet, the youngest in Europe, with an average age of six and a half years. These 
new MAX "Gamechanger" aircraft will reduce fuel consumption by up to 16% and reduce noise emissions by 40%, 
while offering 4% more seats per flights (197 v 189) allowing Ryanair to lower fares even further, while ensuring that 
Ryanair remains Europe's greenest and cleanest airline.
 Ryanair's Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan said:
 "We are pleased to exercise 25 Boeing 737 "Gamechanger" options, bringing our firm orders to 135 737-MAX-
200's with a further 75 options remaining.  The Gamechanger has 8 more seats than our current 189 seat Boeing 
737-800NG and incorporates the latest technology engines and winglets which will reduce fuel consumption and 
noise emissions, ensuring we remain Europe's greenest, cleanest airline, while allowing us to continue to lower 
fares as we grow to 200m annual customers by 2024.  We look forward to taking delivery of our first Gamechanger 
in Spring 2019."
 Boeing Commercial Airplanes' Senior Vice President, Global Sales & Marketing, Ihssane Mounir, said:
 "We are delighted that Ryanair has decided to order an additional 25 higher capacity 737 MAX 8s as it continues to 
significantly grow its fleet and increase capacity across its network. The 737 MAX 8 with 197 seats is undoubtedly 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Exercises 25 Boeing -Max-200 Options
the best possible airplane for the low-cost market and today's increased order with Europe's leading low cost airline 
is testament to that."

 EasyJet (shares up 54%) is an investment of quite recent vintage, having first been purchased during 
autumn 2016, in the wake of the Brexit "leave" vote. Unfortunately, since then, the highly regarded CEO, 
Carolyn McCall has left the business. Her emphasis on return-on-capital meant that the business pursued a 
very disciplined growth strategy, creating much value for shareholders. We will watch carefully to see 
that the new CEO continues to operate the business along similar lines. Apart from the loss of McCall, the 
news for easyJet has been largely positive this year as some weaker European airlines such as Monarch and 
Air Berlin have gone bust and easyJet's strategy of providing a convenient, low-cost alternative to more 
expensive national airlines continues to work. We are pleased with the progress the business is making and 
are excited about the investment. (An aside on Easyjet: if you are ever at a dinner party dull enough to 
be enlivened by an injection of airline trivia, try this: Ryanair and easyJet combined, fly approximately 
2,600 routes. On what percentage of those routes do they compete with each other, within a two-hour time 
slot? Is the answer A: 40%, B: 10% or C: less than 0.5%? The answer is C, less than 0.5%.
 A combination of easy funding and hubris has left parts of the "casual dining" market with too much 
capacity, resulting in financial difficulties and site closures at businesses including Byron, Jamie's 
Italian and Prezzo.   Yet, despite this slew of bad news coming from the overall market, JD Wetherspoon 
(shares up 43%) where food makes up 40% of turnover, grew both sales and profits in 2017. The focused, 
low-cost business model, combined with excellent, consistent customer service continues to endure in a 
market not currently awash with success stories.
 Another company bearing the fingerprints of its founders is niche insurer, Randall & Quilter, (R&Q) 
(shares up 9%) whose principals, Ken Randall and Alan Quilter, started the business in 1991. For the last 
couple of years, R&Q has been selling non-core assets and re-focusing on their "run-off" and "fronting" 
specialisms.  During the year, they issued GBP49m worth of new shares by way of an "open offer" and plan 
to use the money to expand the core business. We are excited about the prospects and added to our 
investment in the open offer.
 The new CEO of Vesuvius (shares up 52%) has recently been reporting improvements in the company's major 
markets (steel foundry and steel flow) as global steel production has been increasing. Sales and profits 
increased over the year and an internal restructuring programme is continuing to lower costs. Debt also 
fell and the 20% return-on-capital remains very impressive for any business, let alone one in an industry 
that is generally capital intensive. Vesuvius specialises in so-called "flat steel", which is used in 
consumer products including cars and fridges, rather than construction. Medium and long-range forecasts 
suggest that flat steel production will increase significantly as consumer goods markets continue to grow 
in China, India and other parts of the developing world.

 During the period, Lloyds (shares up 14%) was returned to full public ownership, increased its dividend, 
increased underlying profit, strengthened its balance sheet, increased the "net interest margin" (the 
difference between interest income earned by Lloyds and the amount Lloyds pays its' own lenders; a higher 
net interest margin is a good thing) and drew nearer to the end of the PPI or "conduct claims" saga. Core 
operating costs fell year-on-year, with the company reporting a market-leading "cost-income ratio" (a 
measure of efficiency). The company reiterated the long-term targets set out by CEO Antonio Horta Osario 
and said that the recent acquisition of the MBNA credit card business is running ahead of schedule. Last 
year we said of the Lloyds investment that "the business fundamentals have been on the turn (i.e. 
improving) for some time and yet the shares remain cheap. It is a good example of why it pays not to stick 
ones neck out and talk about when and why a share price might start to rise" which is even more valid 
today! We added to the Lloyds holding during the year.
 Outlook
 A "top-down" investor might point to Brexit or any other "news" and try and pin-point how the portfolio 
outlook will be impacted by certain macro-economic outcomes. Our "bottom-up" approach means that our 
portfolio outlook is formed by focusing on business fundamentals instead. Although a huge amount of work 
goes into making and monitoring each of our investments, the case for owning each one boils down to a 
pretty simple investment thesis (in fact, an inability to articulate an investment case in simple terms is 
a good warning sign). We spend most of our time questioning and testing the theses using our primary 
research. Every piece of research used at Phoenix is produced in-house; in twenty years we have never made 
an investment using broker research. What is the relevance of this? It means that our investment outlook 
is a moving feast, informed by what we observe by putting boots on the ground and watching our investee 
businesses in action.
 A significant part of this involves mystery shopping; we regularly "buy" a sample basket of sports items 
to test whether Sports Direct remains the lowest cost producer. We spend time inspecting the toilets in 
Weatherspoons' because they are a good litmus test of pub management and are important when customers form 
impressions. Each month, we use housebuilder's web sites to track the sales of new-build houses at over 
100 locations around the UK (tip: housing developments often have their own individual websites that show 
exactly the housing plots available for sale. Identified by a unique number, these plots are removed from 
the websites once sold; by building a regular data series it is relatively easy, albeit time consuming, to 
figure out how many houses are being sold each month.) We visit numerous branches of Tesco and Morrisons 
and in each one we ask shop assistants "where is the soy sauce?" We grade them for the quality of their 
response, record the data and use the trend as one of many indicators of customer service standards.
 We think that the most relevant outlook statement we can make is that currently, the research that we do 
gives us confidence that the companies in our portfolio are performing well, in line with our investment 
theses. And, very importantly, the shares are cheap. These two elements augur well for future investment 
returns.

 OTHER STRATEGIC REPORT INFORMATION
 RISK ANALYSIS
 The Board considers that the principal risks faced by the shareholders of the Company fall into two 
categories:
 External Risks
 Poor performance in the UK and/or world economies; poor corporate profits and dividends.
 Poor stock market performance caused by market-specific factors, such as rising interest rates, the 
unwinding of "bubbles" or disinvestment by institutions, superimposed on general economic factors, or 
caused by shocks, wars, disease etc.  The Board does not consider, however, that short-term volatility 
represents a risk for the long-term shareholder, since it regards long-term performance to be of primary 
importance.
 Internal Risks
 Poor asset management, which may include poor stock selection, excessive concentration of the portfolio, 
mistakes regarding currency movements, speculation in shares of companies without sound or established 
businesses and speculation in derivatives.
 Poor governance, compliance or administration, including particularly the risk of loss of investment 
trust status.
 All these and other risks can result in shareholders not making acceptable returns from their investment 
in the Company.
 RISK CONTROLS
 External risks
Aurora Investment Trust PLC Annual Financial -5-
 As described in the Investment Policy section above, external risks are mitigated by diversification of 
the portfolio and by not utilising gearing.
 Risk diversification
 An element of risk is inherent in investment undertaken on a selective basis.  The Company seeks to 
mitigate the degree of risk by investing in securities in substantial organisations, normally listed and 
traded on the London Stock Exchange, and by spreading its investments across a range of such securities.   
At 31 December 2017 the Company held 16 stocks, spread across 8 main sectors.
 Gearing
 The Company has discontinued the use of gearing as an element of its Exiting Investment Policy and will 
continue to do so under the Revised investment Policy.  Under the articles, borrowings are permitted up to 
a maximum of 30% of NAV.  The Company's agreement with BNP also permits borrowing of up to 30% of NAV, but 
there is currently no intention to make use of this allowance.
 The Board will keep under review whether any provision should be made for the use of short-term borrowing 
for the sole purpose of meeting working capital requirements from time to time.
 Further details concerning currency risks, liquidity risks and interest rate risks are given in note 17.
 Internal risks
 The control of risks related to governance, compliance and administration is dealt with in the report on 
Corporate Governance.
 VIABILITY STATEMENT
 The Company is subject to continuation votes every three years.  As a consequence of the appointment of 
Phoenix, the Directors proposed the replacement of the pre-existing continuation vote schedule by a new 
three-year schedule, with the next vote falling due in 2019.  This was approved by the AGM held in July 
2016.
 Although there will be a continuation vote in 2019, the Directors consider that a longer time frame is 
appropriate for the purpose of assessing the Company's viability. At the present time, the Board's 
expectation is that it will recommend continuation of the Company beyond 2019. Accordingly, they have 
concluded that they should continue to utilise a five year period for this purpose.

 RYANAIR TO PARTNER WITH NIKI LAUDA TO DEVELOP LAUDAMOTION AIRLINE IN AUSTRIA
 RYANAIR TO ACQUIRE 75% SUBJECT TO EU COMPETITION APPROVAL
 Ryanair Holdings Plc today (20 Mar) announced that it has entered into a binding agreement with Mr Niki Lauda to 
support his plan to develop and grow LaudaMotion GmbH, an Austrian Airline based in Vienna.
 LaudaMotion is an Austrian AOC holder owned by Niki Lauda, which has recently acquired many of the assets, 
including A320 aircraft, of the former Niki Airline, and will shortly start a range of scheduled and charter services 
from Germany, Austria and Switzerland primarily to Mediterranean leisure destinations.
 Under this agreement Ryanair will acquire an initial 24.9% stake in LaudaMotion and this will rise as soon as 
possible to 75% subject to EU Competition approval. Niki Lauda will chair the Board of the airline and oversee the 
implementation of his strategy to build a successful Austrian low fares airline. Ryanair will provide financial and 
management support to LaudaMotion as well as 6 wet-lease aircraft for S2018 to enable LaudaMotion to complete 
an extensive 21 aircraft flying program.
 The cost of this 75% investment in LaudaMotion (if approved by the EU) will be less than EUR50m although 
Ryanair will provide an additional EUR50m for year 1 start up and operating costs. Both Mr Lauda and Ryanair will 
work with the existing management team of LaudaMotion and expect the airline to reach profitability by year 3 of 
operations if their plan to grow the business to a fleet of at least 30 Airbus aircraft is successful.
 This partnership provides job security, career opportunities and growth in employment in all activities of 
LaudaMotion, such as cockpit and cabin crew, maintenance and administration, and will allow consumers and 
visitors to benefit from strong competition, leading to more choices and lower fares.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR TO PARTNER WITH NIKI LAUDA
 "We look forward to working in partnership with Niki Lauda to successfully develop his vision for a successful 
Austrian low fares airline to service the schedule and charter markets.  The LaudaMotion AOC will support a fleet of 
Airbus aircraft which is something we have hoped to develop within the Ryanair Group for some years.
 LaudaMotion will benefit from this partnership between Niki Lauda and Ryanair. With access to the Ryanair fleet 
and financial resources, LaudaMotion will now grow more rapidly, as it seeks to compete in a market which is 
dominated by Lufthansa's high airfares with its Swiss and Austrian subsidiaries.
 This LaudaMotion partnership is good news for Austrian and German consumers/visitors who can now look 
forward to real competition, more choice and lower fares.  It is also great news for LaudaMotion's people who can 
look forward to improved job security and more promotional opportunities in Vienna and other bases as we work 
with Niki Lauda and his team to accelerate growth of LaudaMotion - Austria's low fares airline."
 Niki Lauda, Chairman of LaudaMotion said:
 "I have always stood up for competition and have opposed monopolies. Therefore I am thrilled that in the 
partnership with Ryanair, LaudaMotion will be able to establish itself as a strong competitor and to grow quickly and 
sustainably. A new player in the aviation market is born and I am looking forward to offering our passengers an 
extensive route portfolio at competitive air fares."

 RYANAIR & ANPAC SIGN RECOGNITION AGREEMENT FOR ITALY
 ITALY ACCOUNTS FOR 20% OF RYANAIR'S FLEET AND PILOTS
 Ryanair today (8 Mar) confirmed that it has signed a Union Recognition agreement with ANPAC (Italian Airline 
Pilots Association), who will now be the sole representative body for Ryanair employed Pilots in Italy. This 
agreement follows extensive negotiations with ANPAC since Ryanair's December announcement that it was willing 
to recognise Unions for collective bargaining purposes.
 Ryanair welcomes the positive and constructive engagement of ANPAC which led to the formal signing of this 
recognition agreement within 8 weeks of first meeting. This recognition agreement with ANPAC is significant 
because Italy currently accounts for almost 80 of Ryanair's 400+ current aircraft fleet and approx. 20% of Ryanair's 
pilot body.
 Ryanair looks forward to working with ANPAC and its newly elected ANPAC Ryanair Company Council to conclude 
an early CLA (Collective Labour Agreement) for our directly employed pilots based in Italy.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said:
 "We are pleased to announce this Italian recognition agreement with ANPAC on behalf of our directly employed 
pilots in Italy. This agreement (which follows our signed UK recognition agreement with BALPA in January), 
validates the decision of Ryanair's Board in December to recognise unions. The fact that we have delivered pay 
rises of up to 20% for most of our pilots, and union recognition agreements in our two largest markets (UK and Italy) 
which together represent over 45% of our pilot body, shows how constructive Ryanair is about developing 
relationships with those unions who wish to work with us and how much progress we have made in a short period of 
time.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR & ANPAC SIGN RECOGNITION AGREEMENT FOR ITA
 We are making good progress with unions in other major EU countries and we hope to sign more recognition deals 
with pilots and cabin crew unions over the coming weeks and months."

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES NEW ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
 AIRLINE OFFERS CUSTOMERS VOLUNTARY CO2 OFFSETS
 FUNDS RAISED TO SUPPORT CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTS
 Ryanair, Europe's greenest airline, today (7 Mar) launched a new Environmental Policy, which commits to 
ambitious future environmental targets building on impressive achievements to date, including commitments 
to address climate change, and the priorities and policies which will allow Ryanair to continue to lower 
CO2 emissions and noise pollution.
 This Environmental Policy illustrates Ryanair's commitment to managing its impact on the environment by:
 --    Leading the way as Europe's greenest, cleanest airline
 --    Committing to ambitious environmental targets
 --    Investing billions in the newest, most fuel efficient aircraft
 --    Committing to eliminate all non-recyclable plastics within 5 years
 --    Allowing customers to offset the carbon cost of their flights
 Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "As Europe's greenest airline, we are pleased to launch our Environmental Policy, a blueprint for our 
achievements to date and future targets. Operating the youngest fleet in Europe, high load factors and 
efficient fuel burn, has enabled us to continuously lower our CO2 emissions to become the greenest airline 
in Europe. Furthermore, customers can now offset the carbon cost of their flight by making a voluntary 
donation to a climate charity at the end of the booking process, and we have committed to going plastic 
free across our operations over the next five years."
 Ryanair's COO Peter Bellew said:
 "We are pleased to launch our Environmental Policy, which cements our commitment to continuously 
improving the carbon efficiency of our operations. By minimising fuel and energy consumption, reducing 
noise pollution and relentlessly supporting global emissions targets, we will play our part in addressing 
climate change. We will lead the way through these initiatives, and our progress will be published 
annually on our website and in our annual report."

 RYANAIR Q3 PROFITS RISE 12% TO EUR106M ON 4% LOWER FARES
 FY18 PROFIT GUIDANCE UNCHANGED AT EUR1.40BN - EUR1.45BN
 EUR750M SHARE BUYBACK ANNOUNCED
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (Feb. 5) reported a 12% rise in Q3 profit to EUR106m as average fares fell 
4% to just EUR32 per customer.  Traffic grew 6% to 30.4m with load factors up 1% to 96%. Unit costs fell 1% (ex-
fuel unit costs rose 3%).

Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary said:
 "We are pleased to report this 12% increase in profits during a very challenging Q3.  Following our pilot 
rostering failure in Sept., the painful decision to ground 25 aircraft ensured that punctuality of our 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
operations quickly returned to our normal 90% average.  Our AGB customer service programme, coupled with 
4% lower fares, stimulated 6% traffic growth to 30.4m at an industry leading 96% load factor.
 After 30 years of successfully dealing directly with our people it became clear in Dec. that a majority 
of pilots wanted to be represented by unions.  In keeping with our policy to recognise unions when the 
majority of our people wanted it, we have met pilot unions in Ireland, UK, Spain, Germany, Italy, 
Portugal, Belgium and France to discuss how we can work with them on behalf of our people. We have 
successfully concluded our first recognition agreement with BALPA in the UK, a market which accounts for 
over 25% of our pilots.  When this process has completed, we expect to have similar engagement with cabin 
crew unions.  While union recognition may add some complexity to our business and may cause short-term 
disruptions and negative PR it will not alter our cost leadership in European aviation, or change our plan 
to grow to 200m traffic p.a. by Mar. 2024.  Our aircraft allocations may alter by base as we capitalise on 
new growth opportunities in France and Scandinavia.
 New Bases & Routes:
 In Q3 we took delivery of 9 new B737-800's.  European airline consolidation and bankruptcies are 
providing more growth opportunities in the UK, Italy and Germany in particular.  In Nov. we opened a base 
in Poznan (Poland) and in Mar. 2018 we open our 87(th) base in Burgas (Bulgaria).  We recently announced 
flights to Jordan, our 34(th) country. Ryanair's flight connections service was extended (in Jan.) to 
Porto following their initial success at Rome Fiumicino and Milan Bergamo.
 Costs, Fuel Hedging & Balance Sheet:
 Ryanair enjoys significant cost leadership over other airlines in Europe.  In Q3 unit costs fell 1%.  Ex-
fuel, unit costs increased by 3% primarily due to higher staff and EU261 costs arising from the Sept. 
rostering failure and our decision to cancel flights in Sept. & Oct. Staff costs will rise this year by an 
additional EUR45m as we roll out pilot pay increases of up to 20% and raise our crewing ratios in response 
to a tightening market for experienced pilots. Staff costs accounted for 10% of total revenue last year 
and we will not allow our industry leading productivity to decline.  Our cost advantage on other (non-
fuel) cost lines is significantly better than competitors and will continue to improve over the coming 
years as we take delivery of 210 B737-MAX-200 aircraft from April 2019.  These "Gamechangers" have 4% more 
seat capacity, are 16% more fuel efficient and have 40% less noise emissions.  Our capex on the MAX-200 is 
hedged at an average rate of $1.24.
 We recently concluded a 10-year maintenance contract with CFM for our B737-800 engines which will deliver 
substantial annual savings, as will our recent 7 simulator order with CAE, which will double our pilot 
training capacity over the next 3 years.  Q4 fuel is 90% hedged at approx. $49bbl and FY19 is 70% hedged 
at just over $55bbl, well below current spot prices of c.$70bbl.
 Our balance sheet remains strong having generated over EUR1bn net cash from operating activities year-to-
date. In the first 9 months of FY18 we have spent EUR1bn on capex, EUR639m on share buybacks and repaid 
over EUR300m of debt. The Board has approved a EUR750m share buyback of ordinary shares which will start 
in Feb. and, subject to market conditions, should be completed by the end of Oct. This latest buyback will 
increase the funds returned to shareholders since 2008 to over EUR6bn.
 Ancillaries, Labs & Customer Initiatives:
 Ancillary Revenue grew 12% in Q3.  "My Ryanair" is on track to reach 40m members by Mar. 2018. The number 
of customers choosing "Plus" fares, reserved seating and priority boarding continues to rise. Ryanair 
Rooms recently launched travel credits making Ryanair.com the "go to" accommodation website for lowest 
hotel prices. In Nov. we opened our new Labs office in Madrid where we plan to employ up to 250 highly 
skilled IT developers over the next 18 months. From Jan., our customers are enjoying a bigger (20kg) 
checked bag allowance at lower bag check-in fees.   We expect to improve the boarding experience, and on-
time-performance, with the rollout of our new cabin bag policy, whereby priority boarding customers can 
bring 2 free carry-on bags (1 wheelie and 1 small bag) onboard, while all other customers still bring 2 
carry-on bags free of charge but the larger wheelie bag will travel in the hold rather than in the cabin. 
We expect this improvement will substantially reduce flight delays due to bag offloads.
 Brexit:
 We remain concerned at the continuing uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK's proposed departure 
from the EU in Mar. 2019. There remains a worrying risk of serious disruption to UK-EU flights from Apr. 
2019 unless a UK-EU bilateral (or transitional arrangement) is agreed in advance of Sept. 2018. We, like 
other airlines, need clarity on this issue before we publish our summer 2019 schedules in mid-2018 and 
time is running out for the UK to develop and agree these solutions. We believe the UK government 
continues to under-estimate the likelihood of flight disruptions to/from the UK.  We have applied to the 
UK CAA for a UK air operator's certificate ("AOC") as part of our Brexit contingency planning.  We expect 
this process to take several months but to be complete well in advance of Sept. 2018.
 FY18 Outlook:
 Our outlook for the remainder of FY18 is cautious.  As we finalise union discussions along similar lines 
to that agreed in the UK, we expect some localised disruptions and adverse PR so investors should be 
prepared for same. In certain jurisdictions unions representing competitor airlines will wish to test our 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results
commitment to our low cost, high pay/high productivity model to disrupt our operations.  We are fully 
prepared to face down any such disruption if it means defending our cost base or our high productivity 
model.
 We now expect full year traffic to grow 8% to 130m (from 129m previously guided).  The final FY18 fare 
outcome depends on close-in Easter bookings (half of which falls in Q4).  We expect FY18 fares will fall 
by at least 3%.   Ancillary spend per customer should rise by 2%. Unit costs were adversely impacted by 
EUR25m non-recurring EU261 costs in Q2, and EUR45m additional staff costs in H2.  While oil prices have 
risen in H2, we still expect FY18 unit costs to be down 2%. Accordingly, we maintain our full year 
guidance in a range of EUR1.40bn to EUR1.45bn.  This guidance depends heavily on the absence of union 
disruptions, unforeseen security events and close-in Easter bookings.
 Early Indications FY19:
 While we have practically zero visibility on FY19 fares, and our budget is not yet finalised, we do not 
share the optimism of competitors and market commentators for summer 2018 fare rises.  Our traffic will 
grow by 6% in FY19 to 138m but very early indications are that summer 2018 fares will remain under 
pressure.  Costs will rise next year as our fuel bill increases by over EUR300m and a further EUR100m is 
added to staff costs (as up to 20% pilot pay increases annualise).  The lack of clarity on Brexit 
continues to overhang fares and pricing on routes to/from the UK. We would, even at this early date, urge 
extreme caution on investor & analyst assumptions for fares in FY19. We will provide a more detailed FY19 
guidance during our full-year results and investor roadshow in May 2018."

 Marketing, distribution and other rose by 22% to EUR305.5M.  This includes EUR25M non-recurring EU261 
costs arising from flight cancellations in Q2.  Marketing costs are broadly flat (year on year) and 
distribution costs increased at a slower rate than the increase in onboard sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs fell 2% to EUR106.5M, due to the timing of checks, fewer lease 
handbacks than last year and 2 less leased aircraft in the fleet compared to the same period last year.
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals fell by 5% to EUR62.4M due to the handback of 2 leased aircraft over the past year and 
the smaller leased fleet.
 Unit costs fell by 4% (excluding fuel they rose by 1%) which compares favourably to the 10% increase in 
traffic in the period.
 Other income/(expense):
 Net finance expense:
 Net finance expense decreased by 10% to EUR45.2M primarily due to lower interest rates.
 Balance sheet:
 Gross cash fell by EUR927.2M to EUR3,213.1M at December 31, 2017.
 Gross debt fell by EUR314.8M to EUR4,069.7M due to debt repayments.
 EUR1,027.7M net cash was generated by operating activities.  Net capital expenditure was EUR1,026.6M and 
shareholder returns amounted to EUR639.0M.
 Net debt was EUR856.6M at period end.  (March 31, 2017: EUR244.2M).
 Shareholders' equity:
 Shareholders' equity increased by EUR377.0M to EUR4,800.0M in the nine months due to net profit after tax 
of EUR1,398.1M, offset by IFRS hedge accounting treatment for derivatives of EUR386.6M and EUR639.0M of 
shareholder returns.
 Earnings per share (EPS):
 EPS increased by 16% to EUR1.167 per share, ahead of the 11% increase in profit after tax. During the 
nine months the Company bought back and cancelled 35.0M ordinary shares at a total cost of EUR639.0M.

 Going concern
 After making enquiries and considering the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial 
position and cash flows, the Directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the interim 
financial statements, that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from 
the date of approval of the interim financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the interim financial statements.
 Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements of the Company for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2017 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2017, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2017, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
 The December 31, 2017 figures and the December 31, 2016 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2017, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2017 on February 2, 2018.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 The following new and amended standards, have been issued by the IASB, and have also been endorsed by the 
EU. These standards are effective for the first time for the current financial year beginning on or after 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -5-
January 1, 2017 and have been applied by the Group for the first time in these condensed consolidated 
interim financial statements;

January 1, 2017)
 --    Amendments to IAS 12: "Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017)
 --    Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle: "Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in 
Other Entities" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017)
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. Those that are not as yet EU endorsed are 
flagged below. While under review, we do not anticipate that the adoption of these new or revised 
standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position or results from 
operations:
 --    IFRS 15: "Revenue from Contracts with Customers including Amendments to IFRS 15" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)
 --    IFRS 9: "Financial Instruments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2018)

(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)*
 --    Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" with IFRS 4: "Insurance Contracts" 
(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)

January 1, 2018)*

fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)*
 --    IFRS 16: "Leases" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019)
 * These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed.
 IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is 
recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 
Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs. IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.

MD&A for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017
 Income Statement
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
 Scheduled revenues:
 Scheduled revenues are up by 1% to EUR964.2M due to 6% traffic growth (to 30.4M) offset by a 4% drop in 
average fare to EUR31.72.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues increased by 12% to EUR440.7M due to 6% traffic growth and higher uptake of reserved 
seating, priority boarding and car hire offset by lower travel insurance and hotel penetration.
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil fell by 3% to EUR433.0M due to lower hedged fuel prices offset by an 8% increase in block hours and 
a higher load factor (up 1 point to 96%).
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges are up by 6% to EUR223.2M in line with traffic growth.
 Route charges:
 Route charges rose 6% to EUR163.3M due to a 5% increase in sectors offset by lower Eurocontrol prices in 
France, Germany and the UK.
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs increased by 18% to EUR180.7M, due to 8% more hours, pilot salary increases from October 2017 and 
the impact of a 2% pay increase in April 2017.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation is 14% higher at EUR140.1M due to 49 (+15%) additional owned aircraft in the fleet at period end 
(379 at December 31, 2017 compared to 330 at December 31, 2016).
 Marketing, distribution and other:
 Marketing, distribution and other rose by 6% to EUR81.7M primarily due to higher EU261 passenger compensation 
claims.  Marketing costs are broadly flat (year-on-year) and distribution costs increased at a slower rate than the 
increase in onboard sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs fell by 8% to EUR36.0M primarily due to the timing of checks, the absence of 
lease handbacks in the quarter and the smaller leased fleet.
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals fell by 4% to EUR20.9M due to the handback of 2 leased aircraft over the past year and the smaller 
leased fleet.
 Unit costs fell by 1% (excluding fuel they were up 3%) which compares favourably to the 6% increase in traffic in 
the quarter.
 Other income/(expense):
 Net finance expense:
 Net finance expense increased by 5% to EUR13.6M primarily due to lower deposit interest rates.

reduction in average fares to EUR42.69.

 Ancillary revenues rose by 13% to EUR1,452.9M due to 10% traffic growth and the higher uptake of reserved 
seating, priority boarding and car hire offset by lower travel insurance and hotel penetration.
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -4-
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil fell by 3% to EUR1,473.2M due to lower hedged fuel prices offset by an 11% increase in block hours 
and a higher load factor (up 1 point to 96%).
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges are up by 9% to EUR760.2M, lower than the 10% increase in traffic growth.
 Route charges:
 Route charges rose 7% to EUR554.3M due to an 8% increase in sectors offset by lower Eurocontrol prices in 
France, Germany and the UK (aided by weaker sterling).
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs increased by 13% to EUR545.5M due to 11% more hours, pilot salary increases from October 2017 and 
the impact of a 2% pay increase in April 2017 offset by weaker sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation is 12% higher at EUR420.2M due to 49 (+15%) additional owned aircraft in the fleet at period end

 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2017 has been used to 
establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the nine months to December 31, 2017, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --           Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been 
discounted at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at December 31, 
2017 to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
 There were no significant changes in the business or economic circumstances during the nine months to 
December 31, 2017 that affect the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities.
 The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with the carrying amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial balance sheet, are as follows:

 12.          Shareholder returns
 In the nine months ended December 31, 2017 the Company bought back 35.0M shares at a total cost of 
EUR639M. This buy-back was equivalent to approximately 2.9% of the Company's issued share capital at March 
31, 2017.  All of these ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled at December 31, 2017.
 In FY17 the Company bought back 72.3M shares at a total cost of approximately EUR1,018M, all of which 
were cancelled at March 31, 2017. The ordinary shares bought back equated to approximately 5.6% of the 
Company's issued share capital at March 31, 2016.
 As a result of the share buybacks in the nine months ended December 31, 2017, share capital decreased by 
35.0M ordinary shares (72.8M ordinary shares in the year ended March 31, 2017) with a nominal value of 
EUR0.2M (EUR0.4M in the year ended March 31, 2017) and the other undenominated capital reserve increased 
by a corresponding EUR0.2M (EUR0.4M in the year ended March 31, 2017). The other undenominated capital 
reserve is required to be created under Irish law to preserve permanent capital in the Parent Company.
 13.          Related party transactions
 The Company has related party relationships with its subsidiaries, Directors and senior key management 
personnel. All transactions with subsidiaries eliminate on consolidation and are not disclosed.
 There were no related party transactions in the nine months ended December 31, 2017 that materially 
affected the financial position or the performance of the Company during that period and there were no 
changes in the related party transactions described in the 2017 Annual Report that could have a material 
effect on the financial position or performance of the Company in the same period.

Body
 We are evaluating the effect that the updated standard may have on our consolidated financial statements 
and related disclosures. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we 
currently believe the most significant impact relates to certain ancillary revenue products.  Due to the 
complexity of certain of our contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new 
standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and vary in some instances. 
Our preparatory work is also focused on the increased disclosure obligations (including in respect of 
retrospective revenue and backlog).
 IFRS 16: Leases
 IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
 The standard is effective for annual report periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption 
is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date 
of initial application of IFRS 16.
 We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures but do not expect the impact to be material.
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the nine months ended December 
31, 2017 was 10.3% (December 31, 2016: 10.8%).  The tax charge for the nine months ended December 31, 2017 
Ryanair Holdings PLC 3rd Quarter Results -6-
of EUR160.5M (December 31, 2016: EUR152.8M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR154.7M and a deferred tax 
charge of EUR5.8M relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised in 
the income statement.
 5.            Share based payments
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR4.5M (December 31, 2017: EUR4.5M) is the fair value of 
various share options granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement in 
accordance with employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At December 31, 2017 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 412 (2016: 365) Boeing 737 aircraft.  The Group 
agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY15 
to FY19 of which 133 aircraft (including 29 in the nine months) were delivered at December 31, 2017.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (110 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24; these include 10 additional firm orders announced 
in June 2017 which will see aircraft deliveries increase by 5 in both spring 2019 and spring 2020.
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided 
to the CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation 
decisions the CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made 
based on the entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in 
type.  The objective in making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial 
results, rather than individual routes within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the 
Group for the period.  All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has 
a single reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed 
across the Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment 
operations.  In addition, as the Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and 
liabilities have been allocated to the Group's single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

to aircraft pre delivery payments and 29 aircraft deliveries.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2017 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.

 RYANAIR AND BALPA SIGN UK RECOGNITION AGREEMENT
 UK ACCOUNTS FOR 25% OF RYANAIR'S FLEET AND PILOTS
 Ryanair today (30 Jan) confirmed that it has signed a formal Union Recognition agreement with BALPA (British 
Airline Pilots Association), who will now be the sole representative body for Ryanair employed Pilots in the UK.
 This agreement follows extensive negotiations with BALPA since Ryanair's December announcement that it was 
willing to recognise Unions for collective bargaining purposes. While these recognition negotiations were continuing 
with BALPA, the 6 remaining Ryanair UK Bases (including Stansted) voted - in secret ballot - to accept pay 
increases of up to 20%, which had already been agreed by a majority (9) of other UK bases. These pay increases 
mean Ryanair's UK pilots are earning 20% more than competitor 737 pilots (Norwegian and Jet2).
 Ryanair welcomes the positive and constructive engagement of BALPA which led to the formal signing of this 
recognition agreement within 5 weeks of the first meeting. This recognition agreement with BALPA is significant 
because the UK accounts for almost 100 of Ryanair's 400+ current aircraft fleet and over 25% of Ryanair's pilot 
body. Ryanair looks forward to working with BALPA and its newly elected BALPA Ryanair Company Council.
 Welcoming today's recognition agreement, Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said:
 "Welcoming this UK recognition agreement, we are pleased today to announce this UK recognition agreement with 
BALPA on behalf of our directly employed pilots in the UK. The UK accounts for 25% of Ryanair's fleet and pilot 
numbers. This agreement validates the decision of Ryanair's Board in December to recognise unions, and the fact 
that we have delivered pay rises of up to 20% and union recognition for our pilots in our largest market, shows how 
serious Ryanair is about working constructively with unions that are willing to work constructively with us.
 This rapid progress in the UK is in marked contrast to some other EU countries where we are still waiting for a 
response to our recognition proposals and where some unions have failed to put these substantial pay increases to 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR AND BALPA SIGN UK RECOGNITION AGREEMENT
our pilots. We now call on these unions to stop wasting time and act quickly to deliver 20% pay increases to our 
pilots in February, and conclude formal recognition agreements, which they are presently sitting on. Ryanair will not 
allow these unions to delay pay increases to our pilots. In Dublin for example, where just 35% of our pilots have not 
yet received this pay increase, we have warned FÓRSA/IALPA that we will offer it to these pilots individually if they 
refuse / fail to organise a vote among just 35% of our Dublin pilots on this pay increase on/before 31 Jan.
 Today's agreement between Ryanair and BALPA shows that Ryanair can work with unions that wish to work with 
us to promote the interests of both our pilots and our customers."

 RYANAIR UK PILOTS VOTE TO ACCEPT PAY INCREASES
 OF UP TO 20% IN JANUARY
 Ryanair, Europe's favourite airline, today (18 Jan) confirmed that all 15 of its UK pilot bases - including London 
Stansted which had previously rejected an improved pay deal - have now voted in secret ballot to accept pay 
increases of up to 20% and these increases will be paid next week in the January payroll.  These increases bring 
Ryanair's pilot pay in the UK to 20% more than competitor 737 operators (Norwegian and Jet2).
 Ryanair is continuing its recognition discussions with BALPA, the UK pilot union, but had agreed with BALPA that 
these pay increases should not be delayed by these recognition negotiations, which are proceeding quickly. 
Ryanair and BALPA agreed to offer these pay increases to the 6 out of 15 UK bases (including Stansted) which had 
not previously accepted them.
 The majority of Ryanair's pilots in Ireland have already agreed to these pay increases voting in secret ballot at the 
Cork and Shannon bases, and a majority of pilots in Dublin who are contractors or new joiners have already agreed 
them.  Ryanair had asked the remaining Dublin pilots to vote on this large pay increase on or before 17(th) January 
so that they could be paid in next week's January payroll.  Ryanair is disappointed that no such vote was organised 
among the remaining 35% of Dublin pilots who will now not receive this pay increase in the January payroll.
 Ryanair is continuing to negotiate with FORSA and its Ryanair Irish Pilots Council, but these discussions are 
progressing slowly.  Ryanair will continue to communicate with the 35% of Dublin pilots who have yet to accept this 
substantial pay increase which, if accepted, can be included in the February payroll and will take them to 20% 
higher pay than Norwegian 737 pilots in Dublin.

 RYANAIR SMASHES WEEKLY BOOKINGS RECORD
 3 MILLION BOOKINGS IN ONE WEEK FOR FIRST TIME IN ITS HISTORY
 Ryanair today (15 Jan) announced that it smashed its weekly bookings record, taking over 3m bookings in 
one week (for the next 20-week period) for the first time in its history. This new weekly 3m bookings 
record is a direct result of Ryanair's low fares and the continuing success of the "Always Getting Better" 
customer experience programme.
 Wednesday (10 Jan) was the busiest day for bookings last week and the most popular destinations for 
customers included winter holidays to Lanzarote and Tenerife and city breaks to Porto, Milan and Naples.
 Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "We are delighted to announce this new weekly record of over 3 million bookings made on the Ryanair.com 
website and app last week, the equivalent of:
 --    5 bookings a second
 --    the population of Lithuania
 --    the population of Madrid
 --    more than half of the total passengers Virgin Atlantic carry in an entire year
 To celebrate our record week of bookings, we are releasing seats for sale from just EUR14.99 for travel 
between now and April, which are available for booking until midnight Wednesday (17 Jan). Since these 
amazing low prices will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and avoid missing 
out."

 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to 
the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 
2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest 
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of 
the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the

another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

 (v) Applicable in the cases provided for in Regulation 15(b) to (h) of the Regulations (Article 10 (b) to 
(h) of Directive 2004/109/EC). This should be the full name of the shareholder who is the counterparty to 
the natural person or legal entity referred to in Regulation 15 of the Regulations (Article 10 Directive 
2004/109/EC) unless the percentage of voting rights held by the shareholder is lower than the lowest 
notifiable threshold for the disclosure of voting rights holdings in accordance with the requirements of 
the Regulations and the Transparency Rules.
 (vi) The date on which threshold is crossed or reached should be the date on which the acquisition or 
disposal took place or the other reason triggered the notification obligation. For passive crossings, the 
date when the corporate event took effect.
 (vii) The total number of voting rights shall be composed of all the shares, including depository 
receipts representing shares, to which voting rights are attached even if the exercise thereof is 
suspended.

another undertaking then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or 
legal entity, has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed 
or reached and the subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a 
full picture of the group holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or 
financial instruments are effectively held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row 
free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments 
are effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or 
reach the lowest applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity, 
has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the 
subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a full picture of the group 
holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively 
held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free 
row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are 
effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest

 RYANAIR AGREES TO RECOGNISE PILOT UNIONS TO AVOID WIDESPREAD CUSTOMER DISRUPTIONS OVER CHRISTMAS PERIOD
 Ryanair today (Fri 15 Dec) announced that it has written to the pilot unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, 
Italy, Spain and Portugal inviting each of them to talks to recognise these unions as the representative 
body for pilots in Ryanair in each of these countries, as long as they establish Committees of Ryanair 
pilots to deal with Ryanair issues, as Ryanair will not engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines 
in Ireland or elsewhere.
 Ryanair will now change its long standing policy of not recognising unions in order to avoid any threat 
of disruption to its customers and its flights from pilot unions during Christmas week. Ryanair now calls 
on these pilot unions to call off the threatened industrial action on Wed 20 Dec next so that our 
customers can look forward to travelling home for Christmas without the threat or worry of pilot strikes 
hanging over them.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that 
they may be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week.
 If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union process, then we are 
prepared to do so, and we have written today to these unions inviting them to talks to recognise them and 
calling on them to cancel the threatened industrial action planned for Christmas week.
 Recognising unions will be a significant change for Ryanair, but we have delivered radical change before, 
most recently when we launched Ryanair Labs and our highly successful Always Getting Better customer 
improvement programme in 2013.
 Putting the needs of our customers first, and avoiding disruption to their Christmas flights, is the 
reason why we will now deal with our pilots through recognised national union structures and we hope and 
expect that these structures can and will be agreed with our pilots early in the New Year."

Body
 In early July, Norwegian announced that their CFO Frode Foss had resigned after 15 years at the company. Tore 
Ostby, who is vice-president of investor relations, acts as finance chief on an interim basis. Frode Foss 
concentrates on his position as chairman of the board at WR Entertainment, in which Bjorn Kjos, CEO of 
Norwegian, has a stake in. In the same month, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) granted a tentative 
approval to Norwegian's UK subsidiary. Two months later, it was announced that the final approval had been 
granted by the DOT. In September, Norwegian and Ryanair ended talks on a potential feeder-flight agreement 
followed by the announcement that EasyJet and Norwegian agreed that EasyJet will feed Norwegian's long haul 
routes out of London Gatwick. EasyJet offers not only feeder services for Norwegian but also for the Canadian low 
cost operator WestJet and is considering expanding these services to other airports within Europe.
 Norwegian's Argentinian subsidiary applied for permits to operate up to 156 routes and was granted concession for 
the operation of 153 routes from Argentina. The fleet of the subsidiary would start with a fleet of five aircraft and 
grow by six more in the first months of operations. The decision of the Argentinian Government to liberalise the air 
transportation sector, is not embraced by public unions which went on partial strike early September because they 
fear that labour conditions might be weakened. However, Norwegian planned to invest up to ARS 4.3 billion (USD 
247 million) into the new subsidiary and to create up to 3,200 new jobs. Norwegian's experience in opening new 
markets should be an advantage to prevail in this challenging market and political environment.
 For 2017, Norwegian expects a negative impact from the passenger tax in Norway and weaker demand in the UK. 
Performance may be negatively influenced by currency movements and increasing unit costs due to fuel price 
movements. Bookings are solid ahead of the fourth quarter. Flights from London Gatwick to Singapore, the world's 
longest low-cost route, started 28th September. Services from London-Gatwick to Seattle and Denver had been 
launched mid-September. For 2018, Norwegian expects capital expenditures to spend on new aircraft  to amount to 
USD 2.1 billion. The carrier anticipates a negative impact from the introduction of a Swedish passenger tax. 
However, Norwegian Air Shuttle targets unit costs to decrease by 7.1 per cent to 9.5 per cent and estimates a 
production growth of 35 per cent in capacity (ASK) for 2018.
 Thai Airways International PCL
DP Aircraft I Limited Interim Update -3-
 Thai Airways International Public Company Limited, headquartered in Bangkok, is a full service network carrier and 
flag carrier of the Kingdom of Thailand and is majority-owned by the Thai Government (Ministry of Finance) (51.03 
per cent). As at 30 June 2017, the fleet of Thai Airways, including its subsidiary Thai Smile, was 97 aircraft of which 
six are Boeing 787-8s. Two B787-9s had been delivered to Thai during the third quarter. There are no further B787s 
on order. In 2016, the carrier transported more than 22 million passengers and currently flies from Bangkok to over 
63 destinations in 34 countries.
 Second quarter and first half yearly results for 2017 were impacted by low yields, increasing fuel prices and the 
strength of the Thai Baht against Euro and Yen. In the second quarter, operating loss improved by 16.7 per cent 
from THB 1.8 billion (USD 51.2 million) to THB 1.5 billion (USD 44.2 million) compared to the same quarter in the 
previous year while net loss increased from THB 2.9 billion (USD 82.6 million) to THB 5.2 billion (USD 153.1 million) 
due to extraordinary items. Results had been impacted by one-time expenses such as maintenance provisions to 
meet return condition of leased aircraft (THB 275 million), costs related to the Transformation Plan (THB 300 
million), loss from the dilution of Thai's shareholding in NOK Air (THB 428 million), impairment loss of assets and 
aircraft (THB 390 million) as well as a loss on foreign currency exchange (THB 2,431 million). Revenues increased 
by 9.7 per cent and passenger numbers rose by 14.9 per cent. While capacity grew by 7.1 per cent, demand 
increased by 21.9 per cent and the load factor improved by 9.5 percentage points to 78.5 per cent. Aircraft 
utilisation grew by 4.5 per cent to 11.5 hours a day. Cash and cash equivalents stood at THB 21.80 billion (USD 
641.9 million) and total assets were THB 291.80 billion (USD 8.62 billion) as at 30 June 2017.
 In the first half 2017, revenues grew by 3.9 per cent but operating profit decreased by 75.9 per cent to THB 1.3 
billion (USD 39.0 million) compared to the same period in 2016. The net loss was THB 2.0 billion (USD 58.9 million) 
compared to a net profit of THB 3.1 billion (USD 92.9 million). Above mentioned reasons have impacted the results 
significantly. However, growth of demand outperformed the increase in capacity and therefore the load factor 
improved by 7.4 percentage points to 80.7 per cent. The number of passengers carried rose by 12.4 per cent and 
aircraft utilisation by 6.3 per cent. Thai Airways believes to close the year with an annual profit and prepares for 
future growth. Passenger numbers in the first nine months of 2017 increased by 10.6 per cent while capacity and 
demand grew by 5.5 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively compared to the same period in 2016. Cabin load 
factor rose by 6.8 percentage points to 80.4 per cent. The strongest increase in demand was on long-haul routes to 
and from Europe. Cargo freight (measured in tonnes) carried by Thai improved by 16.9 per cent.
 This year, Thai Airways has entered the third and final stage of its restructuring plan ("sustainable growth"). This 
includes six strategies: profitable and competitive advantages, competitive capability and revenue generating, 
excellent service ring, competitive cost and efficient operations, culture building as well as portfolio and new 
business development. Thai invested in a new revenue management system, network management system and 
new system for check-in services. Amongst other advantages, this supports the airline to react faster to competitive 
offers as well as to optimise route, crew and maintenance planning. The third stage also includes the extension of 
code sharing as well as an in-flight entertainment and cabin upgrade to enhance the passenger experience.
 Thai Airways received board approval and is currently seeking governmental approval to purchase 28 new aircraft, 
mainly to replace older aircraft of Thai and Thai Smile in the next five years. The carrier intends to maintain a fleet 
of around 100 aircraft. In September, Thai Airways has approved the roll-over of a USD 150 million loan with a term 
of six month provided by Thailand's finance ministry. In the same month, the ICAO reviewed Thailand's revamped 
regulatory system and removed the country's red flag on its website. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
started reviewing the "Category 2" status for the country, which the agency put in place after Thailand's downgrade 
by the ICAO in 2015 and which currently prevents Thai carriers to serve U.S. destinations. The FAA will perform an 
audit in the coming weeks.
 The number of foreign tourists visiting Thailand increased by 6.6 per cent in the second quarter compared to the 
same quarter in the previous year. The growth is a result of visitors from Indochina, India, Malaysia, Korea and 
China while the numbers of Chinese tourists travelling to Taiwan and South Korea significantly dropped due to 
political pressure. Thailand is supporting the aviation industry by creating the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) 
which targets ten industries, amongst others the aviation industry, to facilitating foreign investments by special 
privileges within three Eastern Thai provinces. The development of the U-Tapao International Airport to become a 
logistic and air cargo centre is a part of the EEC initiative.

 RYANAIR OCT TRAFFIC GROWS 8% TO 11.8M CUSTOMERS
 LF RISES 1% TO 96% ON LOWER FARES
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (2 Nov) released October traffic statistics as follows:
 --     Traffic grew 8% to 11.8m customers.
 --     Load factor rose 1% point to 96%
 --     Rolling annual traffic to October grew 12% to 128.2m customers.

Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "Ryanair's October traffic grew by 8% to 11.8m customers, while our load factor jumped 1% to 96%, on the back of 
lower fares. These figures include the flight cancellations announced in September. Ryanair customers can look 
forward to even lower fares when they make advance bookings for winter or summer, so there's never been a 
better time to book a low fare flight on Ryanair."

 FY PROFIT GUIDANCE UNCHANGED
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (Oct. 31) reported an 11% increase in H1 profit to EUR1.29bn. Traffic grew 
11% to 72m thanks to a strong Easter and a 5% reduction in airfares saving customers over EUR160m in the half 
year. Unit costs (including fuel savings) fell 5%, ex-fuel unit costs were flat.

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "These strong H1 results reinforce the robust nature of Ryanair's low fare, pan-European growth model 
even during a period which suffered a material failure in our pilot rostering function in early September. 
Prior to this event, we were on track to deliver strong H1 results during which we opened 3 new bases and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
80 new routes. We took delivery of 35 new B737's in the first 6 months of 2017, we stimulated 11% traffic 
growth with 5% lower airfares, and achieved an industry record load factor of 97% in the peak summer 
months.
 Ancillary Revenue grew 14%. Customer spend rose 2% as more customers chose optional services such as 
reserved seats, priority boarding and car hire. H1 unit costs fell 5%, excluding fuel it was flat (but 
would have fallen 2% without the EU261 provision). Despite traffic growth of 11% our fuel bill fell 3%. 
Most other cost headings were broadly flat on a per passenger basis, other than our "Sales, Marketing & 
Other" which jumped 30% due to a one-off EUR25m EU261 provision, as we quickly addressed the needs of 
affected customers in September to recover the rostering failure, and eliminate any risk of further 
cancellations.
 Our balance sheet remains strong. Operating activity in H1 generated over EUR935m of net cash. We used 
this for net capex of EUR675m, share buybacks of EUR639m, and debt repayments of EUR200m. Accordingly, net 
debt rose from EUR244m at 31 March to EUR600m at 30 September. We don't plan any more near term buybacks 
as we work to finish the fiscal year with a broadly flat net debt/cash position.
 Customer Initiatives
 We continued in H1 to roll out customer experience improvements. Ryanair.com has become the world's 
largest airline website with 94% of customers visiting directly rather than via search engines. My Ryanair 
has grown to over 30m members in September and we should grow to over 40m by March 2018. Over half our 
customers now choose their preferred seat and our "Plus" fares account for approx. 7% of all sectors sold. 
In H1 we successfully launched Ryanair flight connections at Rome Fiumicino and Milan Bergamo. We expanded 
our hotels service to 5 inventory providers offering over 250,000 hotels and 7.5m rooms worldwide, and we 
will shortly add a travel credit incentive to reward customers using our Ryanair Rooms service.
 European Consolidation
 The underlying trend towards consolidation among European airlines continues. Monarch (5m pax) went 
bankrupt in September, followed by Air Berlin (29m) in October and Alitalia (24m) remains in bankruptcy. 
There are other financially troubled EU airlines who will, we believe, follow them. We are responding to 
these opportunities by continuing to grow in Germany where Lufthansa's purchase of Air Berlin gives them 
an anti-competitive 95% share of the large German domestic market. We will add more aircraft to our UKP 
bases for S18 to take up any slack created by Monarch's collapse, and we continue to grow strongly in 
Italy where we are poised to be the main beneficiary of the inevitable contraction in Alitalia's short 
haul services. These trends, particularly where they allow high fare airlines like Lufthansa, BA and Air 
France to acquire local competitors, while constraining capacity and raising prices, can only be good for 
Ryanair's yield and traffic growth, as our fleet rises to 600 aircraft, and our traffic grows from 129m to 
200m p.a. by 2024.
 Brexit
 We remain concerned at the continuing uncertainty surrounding the terms of the UK's departure from the EU 
in March 2019. There remains a worrying risk of a serious disruption to UK-EU flights in April 2019 unless 
a timely UK-EU bilateral is agreed in advance of September 2018. We, like other airlines, need clarity on 
this issue before we publish our summer 2019 schedules in mid-2018 and time is running short for the UK to 
develop a bilateral solution. We worry that the UK government continues to under-estimate the likelihood 
of such a flight disruption to/from the UK, an outcome that was highlighted by Air France's CEO in an 
interview with The Observer newspaper on 22 October.
 Pilot Rostering Failure & Recovery
 In early September we suffered a material failure in the management of our pilot rostering function. We 
are not short of crews, with over 4,200 pilots (5.2 crews per aircraft) and have hired over 900 new pilots 
this year to date. We operated the peak summer schedule in July & August (12.5m customers monthly) without 
incident. However as we entered September, a series of poor planning decisions created a perfect storm of 
one-off pilot shortages due to:
 -     Over-allocated calendar months of annual leave to over half our pilots in September, October, 
November and December;
 -     a bottleneck of over 200 new recruits were delayed being released to line flying by mis-managed 
blockages in the completion of their base training; and
 -     an insufficient focus on short term pilot recruitment in summer 2017 to allow for a one-off spike 
in annual leave from September to December 2017 caused by our agreement with the IAA to transition over a 
9 month period (April to December 2017), to a new-agreed-calendar year FTL cycle from 1 January to 31 
December 2018.
 This rostering failure caused punctuality in the first half of September to plummet to the low 70%. We 
responded on Fri 15 September by taking a painful decision (solely to protect the other 98% of our 
customers) to cancel 50 (2%) of our 2,200 daily flights for the last 6 weeks of September & October. Then 
on Wed 27 September we announced the grounding of 25 (6%) of our 400 aircraft fleet for the 5 month winter 
season from November to March 2018. These very difficult and disruptive decisions quickly restored our 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report
schedules to 90% punctuality for the 99% of customers who were unaffected by these disruptions, and 
eliminated any further rostering cancellations.
 While we deeply regret these flight cancellations and winter schedule changes, and the disruption they 
caused to some 700,000 (0.5%) of our 129m customers, we have worked hard to re-accommodate or refund all 
affected customer requests within 18 days of notifying them. The overwhelming majority have chosen re-
accommodation on alternative Ryanair flights, but we have also provided refunds, and met our EU261 
obligations in full, at a cost of some EUR25m in H1. Additionally, we have issued every single disrupted 
customer a travel voucher worth EUR40 per sector (EUR80 return) redeemable in October for travel over the 
winter period.
 This rostering failure has challenged us to address the competitiveness of our pilot pay, as well as 
pilot concerns about communications, career progression and basing. While our pay was already slightly 
higher than B737 competitor airlines, we could have responded sooner to a tightening market for 
experienced F.O's with pay increases for our experienced pilots, reinforcing our long standing and 
successful ERC collective bargaining process, and improving the range and choice of bases and contracts we 
offer our pilots. We will now move from being "competitive" to offering materially higher (over 20%) pay 
with better career prospects, superior rosters, and much better job security than Norwegian, among others, 
can offer. We expect these measures, if/when accepted by all our pilot bases, will add some EUR45m to our 
FY18 crew costs (and up to EUR100m in a full year) but will not significantly alter the substantial unit 
cost advantage we have over all other EU airline competitors.

 We are investing in new operations management which will shortly be headed by Peter Bellew returning from his 
successful stint as CEO of Malaysia Airlines. We have added resources to our pilot recruitment, base manager and 
rostering teams so that we can respond quickly to the needs of our pilots and cabin crew, promptly address their 
requests, and work more closely with them to facilitate opportunities at those bases where they wish to live and 
develop their careers. The test of any management team, is the speed and effectiveness with which they respond to 
a crisis, and the pilot rostering failure in early September was just such a crisis. We have responded quickly to 
repair this failure, eliminate further cancellations and we are determined to invest the time, money and manpower to 
ensure that it never recurs.
 Collective Bargaining - some facts
 One of the predictable by-products of this September rostering failure is a renewed campaign of misinformation by 
competitor airline pilot unions. Since Ryanair has, for over 30 years, operated a sophisticated collective bargaining 
process, supported fully by our pilots and cabin crew - confirmed and validated by the Irish Supreme Court - the 
only way our existing 5 year base agreements can be changed (some of which run to 2020) is by negotiation 
between the airline and our base ERC's. This has already taken place successfully at over 10 bases. The Stansted 
pilots have voted, in secret ballot, to reject this large pay increase and we will respect their wishes, and they will 
continue with the existing pay agreement at Stansted until 2020. We will engage with the Stansted ERC to 
understand any concerns they may have, even while we add over 30 new pilots at Stansted in November on these 
new higher pay rates. If Stansted pilots wish to reconsider or revote, they may do so at any time through their ERC. 
However, we will not, and cannot, be forced to meet with any outside group such as the so called EERC which like 
REPA (2004) and RPG (2012) is a front for competitor airline pilot unions (BALPA, IALPA, ECA and even more 
bizarrely some U.S. pilot unions).
 Our People:
 I sincerely want to thank all our people for their help and support over what has been a very difficult 4 week period 
in September. Our pilots, cabin crew, customer handling and customer service teams have responded brilliantly to a 
very difficult situation that was not of their making. Thousands of our pilots and cabin crew have volunteered to work 
days off to ensure that disruption to our customers was minimised. Our customer service teams have worked late 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -2-
and over weekends to re-accommodate those customers who were disrupted and have dealt with over 700,000 
requests in just 18 days, a phenomenal performance of which we are extremely proud.
 I'm sorry that our people have had to listen to misinformation about Ryanair promoted by competitor pilot unions, 
however we have been here before, and we will be again. We understand that the reason they wish to denigrate 
Ryanair is because their airlines cannot compete with us. As usual when these union airlines fail, such as Monarch, 
Air Berlin and Alitalia in recent months, their pilots all come to Ryanair seeking jobs that pay up to EUR175,000 
p.a., deliver a double bank holiday weekend every week, with the best promotions record and, the best job security 
in Europe. We will continue to work hard to deliver for our people, our customers and our shareholders while these 
competitor unions will continue to rail and fail.
 Outlook:
 Having grown H1 traffic by 11%, the grounding of 25 aircraft means we will slow H2 growth to approx. 4%. As a 
result, full year traffic will slow from 131m to 129m customers.  We are 2% better booked than this time last year, 
but at lower fares. We now expect FY18 fares will fall by -4% to -6%, which is slightly better than previous guidance 
(-5% to -7%).  Ancillary spend per customer should rise by 1% this year.
 Ex-fuel unit costs will be adversely impacted by EUR25m in non-recurring EU261 costs and some EUR45m of 
additional pilot costs (higher pay if accepted by our pilots, recruitment and training in H2) arising from the 
September rostering failure. We now expect full year unit costs to fall by c. 2% this year (ex-fuel unit costs will be up 
3%).
 Based on the above, and with the usual caveat about limited H2 yield visibility, we see no reason to alter our full 
year PAT guidance which remains in a range of EUR1.40bn to EUR1.45bn. This guidance, as always, remains 
heavily dependent on close-in H2 bookings, the absence of any further security events, ATC strikes or negative 
Brexit developments."

 Notes forming Part of the Condensed Consolidated
 Interim Financial Statements
 1.            Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies
 Ryanair Holdings plc (the "Company") is a company domiciled in Ireland. The unaudited condensed 
consolidated preliminary financial statements of the Company for the half-year ended September 30, 2017 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the "Group").
 These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements ("the interim financial statements"), 
which should be read in conjunction with our 2017 Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2017, have 
been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard No. 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as 
adopted by the EU ("IAS 34").  They do not include all of the information required for full annual 
financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the most recent published consolidated 
financial statements of the Group. The consolidated financial statements of the Group as at and for the 
year ended March 31, 2017, are available at http://investor.ryanair.com/.
 The September 30, 2017 figures and the September 30, 2016 comparative figures do not constitute statutory 
financial statements of the Group within the meaning of the Companies Act, 2014. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group for the year ended March 31, 2017, together with the independent 
auditor's report thereon, were filed with the Irish Registrar of Companies following the Company's Annual 
General Meeting and are also available on the Company's Website. The auditor's report on those financial 
statements was unqualified.
 The Audit Committee, upon delegation of authority by the Board of Directors, approved the condensed 
consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2017 on October 27, 2017.
 Except as stated otherwise below, this period's financial information has been prepared in accordance 
with the accounting policies set out in the Group's most recent published consolidated financial 
statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and also in compliance with 
IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
 The following new and amended standards, have been issued by the IASB, and are effective for the first 
time for the current financial year beginning on or after January 1, 2017;
 --    Amendments to IAS 7: "Disclosure Initiative" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2017)
 --    Amendments to IAS 12: "Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017)
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
 --    Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014-2016 Cycle: "Amendments to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in 
Other Entities" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2017)
 The following new or revised IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations will be adopted for purposes of the 
preparation of future financial statements, where applicable. Those that are not as yet EU endorsed are 
flagged below. While under review, we do not anticipate that the adoption of these new or revised 
standards and interpretations will have a material impact on our financial position or results from 
operations:
 --    IFRS 15: "Revenue from Contracts with Customers including Amendments to IFRS 15" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)
 --    IFRS 9: "Financial Instruments" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2018)
 --    Clarifications to IFRS 15: "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for fiscal periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2018)*
 --    Amendments to IFRS 2: "Classification and Measurement of Share Based Payment Transactions" 
(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)*
 --    Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" with IFRS 4: "Insurance Contracts" 
(effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)*
 --    Annual Improvements to IFRS 2014-2016 Cycle (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2018)*
 --    IFRIC Interpretation 22: "Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration" (effective for 
fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018)*
 --    IFRS 16: "Leases" (effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019)
 * These standards or amendments to standards are not as yet EU endorsed.
 IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is 
recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 
Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs. IFRS 15 is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
 We are evaluating the effect that the updated standard may have on our consolidated financial statements 
and related disclosures. While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we 
currently believe the most significant impact relates to certain ancillary revenue products.  Due to the 
complexity of certain of our contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the new 
standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and vary in some instances. 
Our preparatory work is also focused on the increased disclosure obligations (including in respect of 
retrospective revenue and backlog).
 IFRS 16: Leases
 IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet, lease accounting model for lessees.  A lessee recognises a 
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing 
its obligation to make lease payments. There are optional exemptions for short-term leases and leases of 
low value items.
 The standard is effective for annual report periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Early adoption 
is permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers at or before the date 
of initial application of IFRS 16.
 2.            Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions 
that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expense.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
 In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the significant judgements made 
by management in applying the Group's accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty 
were the same as those that applied in the most recent published consolidated financial statements.
 3.            Seasonality of operations
 The Group's results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter, and management 
expects these variations to continue.  Among the factors causing these variations are the airline 
industry's sensitivity to general economic conditions and the seasonal nature of air travel.  Accordingly, 
the first half-year typically results in higher revenues and results.
 4.            Income tax expense
 The Group's consolidated effective tax rate in respect of operations for the half-year ended September 
30, 2017 was 10.6% (September 30, 2016: 10.8%).  The tax charge for the half-year ended September 30, 2017 
of EUR153.2M (September 30, 2016: EUR141.3M) comprises a current tax charge of EUR148.8M and a deferred 
tax charge of EUR4.4M relating to the temporary differences for property, plant and equipment recognised 
in the income statement.
 5.            Share based payments
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -6-
 The terms and conditions of the share option programme are disclosed in the most recent, published, 
consolidated financial statements. The charge of EUR3.0M (September 30, 2016: EUR3.0M) is the fair value 
of various share options granted in prior periods, which are being recognised within the income statement 
in accordance with employee services rendered.
 6.            Contingencies
 The Group is engaged in litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business.  The Group does not 
believe that any such litigation will individually, or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Group.  Should the Group be unsuccessful in these litigation actions, 
management believes the possible liabilities then arising cannot be determined but are not expected to 
materially adversely affect the Group's results of operations or financial position.
 7.            Capital commitments
 At September 30, 2017 Ryanair had an operating fleet of 403 (2016: 358) Boeing 737 aircraft.  The Group 
agreed to purchase 183 new Boeing 737-800NG aircraft from the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY15 
to FY19 of which 124 aircraft (including 20 in the half-year) were delivered at September 30, 2017.
 The Group also agreed to purchase up to 210 (110 firm and 100 options) Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft from 
the Boeing Corporation during the periods FY20 to FY24; these include 10 additional firm orders announced 
in June 2017 which will see aircraft deliveries increase by 5 in both spring 2019 and spring 2020.
 8.            Analysis of operating segment
 The Group is managed as a single business unit that provides low fares airline-related activities, 
including scheduled services, car-hire, internet income and related sales to third parties. The Group 
operates a single fleet of aircraft that is deployed through a single route scheduling system.

Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 MD&A for the Half-Year Ended September 30, 2017
 Income Statement
 Scheduled revenues:
 Scheduled revenues are up by 5% to EUR3,413.1M due to 11% traffic growth (to 72M) offset by a 5% reduction in 
average fares to just over EUR47.
 Ancillary revenues:
 Ancillary revenues increased by 14% to EUR1,012.2M due to 11% traffic growth and higher uptake of reserved 
seating, priority boarding and car hire offset by lower travel insurance and hotel penetration.
 Operating Expenses:
 Fuel and oil:
 Fuel and oil fell by 3% to EUR1,040.2M due to lower hedged fuel prices offset by a 12% increase in block hours 
and a higher load factor (up 1 point to 96%).
 Airport and handling charges:
 Airport and handling charges are up by 11% to EUR537.0M in line with traffic growth.
 Route charges:
 Route charges rose 8% to EUR391.0M due to a 10% increase in sectors offset by lower Eurocontrol prices in 
France, Germany and the UK (aided by weaker sterling).
 Staff costs:
 Staff costs increased by 11% to EUR364.8M, in line with the 11% increase in traffic, due to 10% more sectors and 
the impact of a 2% pay increase in April 2017 offset by weaker sterling against the euro.
 Depreciation:
 Depreciation is 11% higher at EUR280.1M due to 51 (+16%) additional owned aircraft in the fleet at period end 
(370 at September 30, 2017 compared to 319 at September 30, 2016).
 Marketing, distribution and other:
 Marketing, distribution and other rose by 30% to EUR223.8M.  This includes EUR25M non-recurring EU261 costs

distribution costs increased at a slower rate than the increase in onboard sales.
 Maintenance, materials and repairs:
 Maintenance, materials and repairs rose 2% to EUR70.5M, well below the 11% increase in traffic, due to the timing 
of checks offset by 6 fewer leased aircraft in the fleet compared to the same period last year.
 Aircraft rentals:
 Aircraft rentals fell by 6% to EUR41.5M due to the handback of 6 leased aircraft over the past year.
 Ownership and maintenance:
 During the half-year ended September 30, 2017 ownership and maintenance costs (depreciation, maintenance, 
aircraft rentals and financing costs) increased by 5% to EUR424.5M, which is significantly lower than the 11%

 Unit costs fell by 5%, excluding fuel they remained flat, which compares favourably to the 11% increase in traffic in 
the period.

 Going concern
 After making enquiries and considering the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and its financial position and 
cash flows, the Directors have formed a judgment, at the time of approving the interim financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the interim 
financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the interim 
financial statements.

March 31, 2017.  All of these ordinary shares repurchased were cancelled at September 30, 2017.
 In FY17 the Company bought back 72.3M shares at a total cost of approximately EUR1,018M, all of which 
were cancelled at March 31, 2017. The ordinary shares bought back equated to approximately 5.6% of the

 Independent review report of KPMG to Ryanair Holdings plc and Subsidiaries
 Introduction
 We have been engaged by the Company to review the condensed consolidated interim financial statements in 
the half-yearly financial report for the six month period ended September 30, 2017, which comprises the 
condensed consolidated interim balance sheet, the condensed consolidated interim income statement, the 
condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income, the condensed consolidated interim 
statement of cash flows, the condensed consolidated interim statement of changes in shareholder's equity 
and the related explanatory notes.
 The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU ("IFRSs") and also IFRS as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board.
 Our review was conducted having regard to the Financial Reporting Council's ("FRCs") International 
Standard on Review Engagements ("ISRE") (UK and Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information 
Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity'.
 Conclusion
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -8-
 Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the condensed set 
of consolidated interim financial statements in the half-yearly report for the six months ended September 
30, 2017 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the EU, the TD 
Regulations, the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.
 Basis of our report, responsibilities and restriction on use
 The half-yearly financial report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The 
Directors are responsible for preparing the half-yearly financial report in accordance with the TD 
Regulations, the Transparency Rules of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Transparency Rules of the 
United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.
 As disclosed in note 1, the annual financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union.
 The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the condensed consolidated interim financial statements 
of the Group included in this half-yearly financial report have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 
"Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted by the EU.
 Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed set of consolidated interim 
financial statements in the half-yearly financial report based on our review.
 We conducted our review having regard to the Financial Reporting Council's International Standard on 
Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the 
Independent Auditor of the Entity.  A review of interim financial information consists of making 
enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical 
and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance 
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, 
we do not express an audit opinion.
 We read the other information contained in the half-yearly financial report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the information in the condensed set of consolidated interim financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the review. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Body
 The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that internally is provided to the 
CEO, who is the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM).  When making resource allocation decisions the 
CODM evaluates route revenue and yield data. However, resource allocation decisions are made based on the 
entire route network and the deployment of the entire aircraft fleet, which are uniform in type.  The objective in 
making resource allocation decisions is to maximise consolidated financial results, rather than individual routes 
within the network.
 The CODM assesses the performance of the business based on the adjusted profit/(loss) after tax of the Group for 
the period.  All segment revenue is derived wholly from external customers and as the Group has a single 
reportable segment, intersegment revenue is zero.
 The Group's major revenue-generating asset comprises its aircraft fleet, which is flexibly employed across the 
Group's integrated route network and is directly attributable to its reportable segment operations.  In addition, as the 
Group is managed as a single business unit, all other assets and liabilities have been allocated to the Group's 
single reportable segment.
Reportable segment information is presented as follows:

 10.          Property, plant and equipment
 Acquisitions and disposals
 Capital expenditure in the half-year to September 30, 2017 amounted to EUR675.0M and primarily relates to 
aircraft pre delivery payments and 20 aircraft deliveries.
 11.          Financial instruments and financial risk management
 The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising in the normal course of business. The Group's 
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks. The Group uses financial instruments to manage exposures arising from these risks.
 These preliminary financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and 
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the 2017 
Annual Report. There have been no changes in our risk management policies in the period.
 Fair value hierarchy
 Financial instruments measured at fair value in the balance sheet are categorised by the type of 
valuation method used. The different valuation levels are defined as follows:
 --           Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
that the Group can access at the measurement date.
 --           Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for 
that asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
 --           Level 3: significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
 Fair value estimation
 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following methods and 
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of the Group's financial 
instruments:
 Financial instruments measured at fair value
 --           Derivatives - interest rate swaps: Discounted cash flow analyses have been used to determine 
the fair value, taking into account current market inputs and rates. (Level 2)
 --           Derivatives - currency forwards and aircraft fuel contracts: A comparison of the contracted 
rate to the market rate for contracts providing a similar risk profile at March 31, 2017 has been used to 
establish fair value. (Level 2)
 The Group policy is to recognise any transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end 
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred. During the half-year to September 30, 2017, 
there were no reclassifications of financial instruments and no transfers between levels of the fair value 
hierarchy used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments.
 Financial instruments disclosed at fair value
 --           Fixed-rate long-term debt: The repayments which Ryanair is committed to make have been 
discounted at the relevant market rates of interest applicable (including credit spreads) at September 30, 
2017 to arrive at a fair value representing the amount payable to a third party to assume the obligations.
Ryanair Holdings PLC Half-year Report -7-

 PETER BELLEW TO JOIN RYANAIR AS CHIEF OPERATIONS OFFICER
 Ryanair today (17 Oct) announced that Peter Bellew would re-join Ryanair as Chief Operations Officer. Mr. Bellew 
who is currently the CEO of Malaysia Airlines will take over responsibility for all Ryanair's flight operations, ground 
operations and engineering but with a specific responsibility for pilot production, training and career development 
with a mission to ensure that the pilot rostering failure which Ryanair suffered in early September will never be 
repeated.
 Mr. Bellew, who previously worked in Ryanair until 2014, latterly as Director Flight Operations, will join the Ryanair 
team in Dublin from Friday 1(st) December next.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We are pleased to welcome Peter back to Ryanair. Having worked previously in a senior role in our Operations 
team, Peter has an unrivalled knowledge of our business model and how we maintain controlled growth, with 
industry leading punctuality, for the benefit of our customers and our people. Peter will lead a significant 
transformation in the way we reward and interact with our pilots, improve their working environment and career 
development over the coming years as we grow the fleet to some 600 aircraft and expand our traffic, at lower fares, 
to 200m customers p.a."
 Peter Bellew said:
 "I am excited to return home to Ryanair and take up the challenge to grow the operation sustainably.  I look forward 
to working with all the team and all the crews I know so well to further develop our growth to 600 aircraft over the 
next 6 years."

 TOTAL VOTING RIGHTS
 In conformity with Regulation 20 of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109 EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended), 
Ryanair announces that as at 30 September 2017:
 Ryanair's issued share capital consists of 1,182,860,772 Ordinary Shares of nominal value EUR0.006 each with 
voting rights. Ryanair does not hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury.  Therefore, the total number of voting rights in 
Ryanair is 1,182,860,772.
 The above figure may be used by shareholders as a denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if 
they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, Ryanair under the Transparency 
(Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (as amended) and the Interim Transparency Rules of the Central Bank.

 (xiii) If the person subject to the notification obligation is either controlled and/or does control another undertaking 
then the second option applies.
 (xiv) The full chain of controlled undertakings, starting with the ultimate controlling natural person or legal entity, 
has to be presented also in cases in which only on subsidiary level a threshold is crossed or reached and the 
subsidiary undertaking discloses the notification, as only thus will the markets get a full picture of the group 
holdings. In the case of multiple chains through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are effectively 
held, the chains have to be presented chain by chain leaving a row free between different chains (e.g.: A, B, C, free 
row, A, B, D, free row, A, E, F etc.).
 (xv) The names of controlled undertakings through which the voting rights and/or financial instruments are 
effectively held have to be presented irrespective of whether the controlled undertakings cross or reach the lowest 
applicable threshold themselves.
 (xvi) Example: Correction of a previous notification.

 RYANAIR RESPONDS FULLY TO CAR (& CAA) REQUIREMENTS TO CLARIFY CUSTOMER ENTITLEMENTS DURING CANCELLATIONS
 Ryanair today (29(th) Sept) met with the Irish Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) and agreed to 
implement a series of steps to address the CAR's requirements to ensure that all customers affected by 
Ryanair's recent rostering related flight cancellations are fully aware of their EU261 rights and 
entitlements, including full refunds, or re-accommodation onto other Ryanair flights or other comparable 
transport options with reimbursement of reasonable out of pocket expenses.
 The steps agreed with the CAR are as follows:
 1.   Ryanair has today issued a clarification email to all affected customers outlining their rights to 
refunds, re-routing on Ryanair or on other comparable transport options and expenses (see attached).
 2.   Ryanair has also today issued a press release (copy attached) explaining to customers how and when 
they will be re-accommodated on other Ryanair flights or other airline flights. This press release will be 
displayed on the home page of Ryanair's website from today.
 3.   Ryanair has updated the FAQ pages of its website to reflect all of these changes.
 Ryanair has also today replied to the UK CAA letter of 28 Sept, agreeing to meet its requirement for 
customer clarification on Ryanair's EU261 obligations, which are in line with those requested by the CAR.
 Ryanair has called upon the UK CAA to now require UK airlines to comply with these EU261 obligations 
which the CAA did not apply to British Airways in May this year, when a computer meltdown stranded 
hundreds of thousands of British citizens/visitors at London Heathrow and many other airports, with no 
apparent action taken by the CAA in respect of re-accommodation or enforcement against British Airways.

 It is unlikely that the exceptionally benign investment conditions - particularly low interest rates - will persist. 
Policymakers have signalled that interest rates will have to rise as inflationary pressures increase. Further, the 
evident tensions in the West between capital and labour are likely to lead to less business-friendly policies. Yet 
there will be good investment opportunities. Sidestepping politically vulnerable areas, there will be rewards for 
companies which can exploit opportunities presented by technology advances and changing customer needs. As 
much as ever we focus on companies that operate in a favourable industry landscape and where their business 
models are robust. Where these companies compete and succeed on the world stage the rewards can be 
commensurately greater. There is no doubt that new opportunities will present themselves and we are confident 
that our investment process remains appropriate.

Cross Holdings in other Investment Companies
 As at 31 May 2017 none of the Company's assets were invested in the securities of other listed closed-ended 
investment companies. It is the Company's stated policy that it will not invest in other closed-ended investment 
companies.
 Strategic Review
 The Strategic Report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and 
Directors' Report) Regulations 2013.
 The Strategic Report seeks to provide shareholders with the relevant information to enable them to assess the 
performance of the Directors and the Company during the period under review.
 Business and Status
 During the year the Company carried on business as an investment trust with its principal activity being portfolio 
investment. The Company has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs as an investment trust subject to the 
Company continuing to meet the eligibility conditions of sections 1158 and 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 
and the ongoing requirements for approved companies as detailed in Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Investment Trust 
(Approved Company) (Tax) Regulations 2011. In the opinion of the Directors, the Company has conducted its 
affairs in the appropriate manner to retain its status as an investment trust.
 The Company is an investment company within the meaning of section 833 of the Companies Act 2006.
 The Company is not a close company within the meaning of the provisions of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 and 
has no employees.
 The Company was incorporated in England & Wales on 28 September 1999 and started trading on 20 November 
2000, immediately following the Company's launch.
Jupiter European Opps. Trust PLC Annual Financial -3-
 Reviews of the Company's activities are included in the Chairman's Statement and Investment Adviser's Review 
above.
 There has been no significant change in the activities of the Company during the year to 31 May 2017 and the 
Directors anticipate that the Company will continue to operate in the same manner during the current financial year.
 Planned Life of the Company
 The Articles of Association of the Company provide that at every third Annual General Meeting (AGM) an ordinary 
resolution shall be proposed that the Company shall continue in existence as an investment trust. If any such 
resolution is not passed at any of those meetings, the Directors shall, within 90 days of the date of the resolution, 
put forward to shareholders proposals (which may include proposals to wind up or reconstruct the Company) 
whereby shareholders are entitled to receive cash in respect of their shares equal as near as practicable to that to 
which they would be entitled on a liquidation of the Company at that time (and whether or not shareholders are 
offered other options under the proposals).
 As a resolution to that effect was passed at the 2014 AGM, the Directors will propose an ordinary resolution for the 
continuation of the Company in its current form at the AGM of the Company to be held on 7 November 2017. If such 
a resolution is not passed, the Directors will formulate proposals to be put to shareholders to reorganise or 
reconstruct the Company, or for the Company to be wound up.
 Shareholders should note that the valuations used to produce the financial statements on a going concern basis 
might not be appropriate if the Company were to be liquidated.
 Investment Strategy
 In order to achieve the objective of investing in securities of European companies and geographical sectors or 
areas which offer good prospects for capital growth, the Investment Adviser adopts a stock picking approach, in the 
belief that a thorough analysis and understanding of a company is the best way to identify long-term superior 
growth prospects.
 Benchmark Index
 The Company's benchmark index is the FTSE World Europe ex UK Total Return Index.
 Dividend Policy
 The Directors intend to manage the Company's affairs to achieve shareholder returns through capital growth rather 
than income. It is therefore not expected that the Company will pay a regular annual dividend. However, in order to 
qualify for approval by HM Revenue and Customs as an investment trust, no more than 15 per cent. of the income 
which the Company derives from ordinary shares or securities can be retained in respect of each accounting period. 
As such, the Company may declare a dividend from time to time.
 Management
 The Company has no employees and most of its day-to-day responsibilities are delegated to Jupiter Asset 
Management Limited, who act as the Company's Investment Adviser and Company Secretary.
 J.P. Morgan Europe Limited acts as the Company's Depositary and the Company has entered into an outsourcing 
arrangement with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A. for the provision of accounting and administration services.
 Although Jupiter Asset Management Limited is named as the Company Secretary, J.P. Morgan Europe Limited 
provides administrative support to the Company Secretary as part of its formal mandate to provide broader fund 
administration services to the Company.
 Internal Controls and Risk Management Systems
 The Board has established an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by 
the Company.

Body
 A.  You have received an email notice from Ryanair today (Wednesday 27(th) Sept) advising you of any 
flight changes, and offering you alternative flights or a full refund. If you have not received an email 
from Ryanair today then you are among the 99% of customers whose flights will be unaffected by these 
changes.
 3.   Why is Ryanair going to grow more slowly?
 A.  Ryanair has grown rapidly over 30 years to carry 129m customers p.a. more than any other EU airline. 
However, it suffered a roster failure in September because it has over allocated months of pilot annual 
leave during the 4 months from Sept to December.
 4.   Why not allocate less annual leave?
 A.  Because Ryanair agreed with the IAA to operate a 9 month annual leave transition period from April - 
December 2017 to move from a holiday leave year of April 16 to March 17 to a calendar annual leave year 
from Jan 18 - Dec 18.
 5.   Is Ryanair short of pilots?
 A.  No. Ryanair with 400 aircraft currently employs over 4,200 pilots a ratio of over 10 pilots per 
aircraft. Only 4 pilots are needed per aircraft per day.
 6.   Is Ryanair struggling to recruit pilots?
 A.  No. Ryanair has more than 2,500 pilots on a waiting list hoping to join Europe's No. 1 airline. We 
have offered jobs to over 650 new pilots who will join us between now and May 2018.
 7.   Are lots of pilots leaving Ryanair?
 A.  No in the current year less than 100 of over 2,000 captains left Ryanair (mainly retirements or to 
long haul airlines) and less than 160 F.O's who have mainly left to join long haul airlines.
 8.   What does this slower winter growth mean for customers?
 A.  Less than 400,000 customers (booked on flights across our 200 airports between November and March 
will today receive between 5 weeks and 5 months' notice of schedule changes. They may switch to 
alternative Ryanair flights or obtain full refund if new flight times/dates don't suit. They will also 
receive a EUR40 one way (or EUR80 return) travel voucher which they can use in October to book a Ryanair 
flight for travel between October to March.
 9.   What have Ryanair done for customers on the 2,100 flights cancelled last Mon 18 Sept?
 A.  Over 97% of these customers received flight changes or full refunds by Sun 24 Sept. Today these 
315,000 customers have also received a EUR40 travel voucher (EUR80 return) to book a Ryanair flight 
between October to March 2018.
 10. Is there "flight chaos" in Ryanair?
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR END ROSTER -2-
 A.  No. All flights are operating normally. Over the past week from Tues 19 to Mon 25 Sept Ryanair 
operated over 16,000 flights with over 96% of first wave departures on time, and just 3 flights cancelled 
(due to 1 runway closure and 2 adverse weather diversions).
 11. How many flights did Ryanair cancel in Sept/Oct due to this rostering problem?
 A.  2,100 of our over 800,000 annual flights.
 12. How many flights will be schedule changed over the 5 months Nov to March to meet this slower growth 
plan?
 A.  Less than 18,000 of our 800,000 annual flights. This is less than 1 flight per day per airport across 
our 200 airports over the 5 month winter period. Many of these flights, especially in Jan, Feb and March 
have no bookings whatsoever.
 13. How many customers have been affected by todays schedule changes?
 A.  Less than 400,000 of Ryanair's 129m customers in the current year. Over 99% of Ryanair customers have 
been unaffected.
 14. What effect will slower growth have on Ryanair pilots?
 A.  It will create 25 more spare aircraft and more than 100 daily extra standby pilots from November to 
March. It means all calendar months of pilot leave will now be secure and Ryanair will not require pilots 
to reorganise their annual leave.
 15. How many Ryanair pilots have a calendar month of leave to take before December?
 A.  Almost 50% of Ryanair pilots will receive 1 month off over 4 months as follows;
Sept   over 460
 pilots
 Oct      " 470
 "
 Nov      " 620
 "
 Dec      " 510
 "
16. Will this A/L rostering problem recur in 2018?
 A.  No because A/L will be allocated over a full 12 month period in 2018.
 17. Has there been management changes in the pilot rostering area?
 A.  Yes. The pilot recruitment and rostering function has been taken over by Ryanair's Chief People 
Officer who will over the next 6 months hire more rostering managers, schedule the training of the 650 
pilots Ryanair has already recruited to fly Ryanair's S18 fleet of 435 operating aircraft, and meet with 
ERC's and pilots to address their concerns.
 18. How much will the 2,100 cancellations cost Ryanair?
 A.  The refunds and EU261 costs will cost Ryanair under EUR25m while we expect the free flight vouchers 
will cost less than EUR25m.
 19. Have all affected customers been advised of these winter schedule changes?
 A.  Yes, all affected customers have received email notifications today.
 20. Are these schedule change customers entitled to EU261 compensation?
 A.  No as these schedule changes have been made with 5 weeks to 5 months of advance notice, EU261 
compensation does not arise.
 21. Will this slower growth affect Ryanair traffic numbers?
 A.  Yes. Ryanair will now carry over 129m customers in the year to March 2018 (previously 131m) and in 
the year to March 2019 growth will slow from 142m to 138m customers.
 22. Will fares rise as a result of this slower growth?
 A.  No. Ryanair will keep reducing fares. A series of seat sales will roll out over the next few months 
starting with a 1 million seat sale this weekend at fares from EUR9.99 one way.
 23. Will slower growth affect Ryanair profits?
 A.  No. Ryanair expects its full year PAT forecast of EUR1.40bn to EUR1.45bn to remain unchanged. 
Although over the next two years as Ryanair hires more pilots and raises pilot pay, costs will rise 
slightly but we don't believe this will impact profitability.
 24. Will Ryanair be doing anything more for its pilots?
 A.  Yes. We have already agreed EUR10,000/EUR5,000 pay increases with our pilot ERC's (Employee 
Representative Committee) at Dublin, Stansted, Frankfurt and Berlin. Ryanair has also received requests 
from other base ERC's for meetings to discuss pay and conditions and will be arranging these meetings over 
the coming months.
 25. Will Ryanair meet with other airlines' pilots or pilot unions?
 A.  No. Ryanair only meets directly with its people. It will not meet with competitor pilots or their 
unions.
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR END ROSTER -2-
 26. Will there be any more cancellations?
 A.  No. This slower growth means we will have surplus spare aircraft and pilots all winter and in summer 
2018. In the last week we operated over 16,000 flights with only 3 cancellations, 1 due to a runway 
closure and 2 adverse weather diversions.
 27. How do I know if my flight has been affected?
 A.  You will have received a schedule change email from Ryanair either on Mon 18 Sept or today Wed 27 
Sept. If you have not received an email notification from Ryanair then you are one of the 99% of customers 
unaffected by these cancellations or schedule changes.
 28. Do Ryanair pilots suffer low pay or poor working conditions?
 A.  No. Ryanair pilots enjoy great pay and industry leading T's & C's as follows;
 -     Captain's earn between EUR120,000 to EUR180,000 p.a.
 -     At Dublin and 3 other bases this has recently increased by EUR10,000 p.a.
 -     F.O's can expect to be promoted to Captain within 4 years of joining Ryanair
 -     Pilots enjoy a fixed roster of 5 days duty followed by 4 days off which equates to a double bank 
holiday weekend after every 5 days of work
 -     Pilots by law cannot fly more than 900 hrs p.a.
 29. Will Ryanair slow down its aircraft orders?
 A.  No. We will buy 50 new Boeing 737 aircraft between Sept 17 and May 18. We buy 20 aircraft from Boeing 
in the winter of 2018/19.
 30. Will Ryanair be meeting directly with its pilots?
 A.  Yes. We normally meet with our 86 Pilot base ERC's each winter. These meetings have already started 
and agreed pay increases (base supplements) at Dublin, Stansted,  Berlin and Frankfurt bases. We are now 
scheduling meetings with other bases as individual pilots and ERC's have requested meetings.
 31. Will Ryanair hire more pilots?
 A.  Yes. We plan to increase our pilot recruitment over the next 12 months from 5.2 crews (10.4 pilots) 
per aircraft to 5.5 crews (11 pilots) per aircraft. We will also need to hire fewer pilots in the winter 
of 2018/19 because of a timing gap between aircraft orders, when we only take delivery of 20xB737 aircraft 
between Sept 18 to May 2019 instead of the usual 50 aircraft deliveries this winter.
 32. Is there a list of routes that are suspended from November for the winter following these 25 aircraft 
groundings?
 A.  Yes. The following 34 routes are suspended for the winter season from November to March 2018
1.   Bucharest - Palermo      18.   Sofia - Castellon
 2.   Chania - Athens          19.   Sofia - Memmingen

 Ryanair Holdings PLC
 27 September 2017
 RYANAIR TO END ROSTERING CANCELLATIONS BY SLOWING GROWTH THIS WINTER FROM NOVEMBER TO MARCH 2018
 Ryanair, Europe's largest airline today (27 Sept) confirmed it will slow its growth this winter (Nov 17 
to Mar 18), by flying 25 less aircraft (of its 400 fleet) from November, and 10 fewer aircraft (of 445) 
from April 2018. By reducing its flying schedule in this controlled manner Ryanair will;
 -eliminate all risk of further flight cancellations, because slower growth creates lots of spare aircraft 
and crews across Ryanair's 86 bases this winter.
 -roster all of the extra pilot leave necessary in Oct, Nov and Dec to meet the IAA's requirement to 
complete a 9 month annual leave transition period (April to Dec '17) so that Ryanair starts a new calendar 
leave year from 1(st) Jan 2018 with no backlog.
 -roster almost 40% of the annual pilot leave requirement for 2018 in Q1 2018, which removes risk of 
roster problems recurring next year.
 -roll out a series of low fare seat sales for winter 2017 confident that there will be no further roster 
related cancellations.
 Slower growth this winter will have positive but differing impacts on Ryanair's stakeholder groups as 
follows;
 1.   For Ryanair Customers
 (a)  Flying 25 fewer aircraft this winter will result in a number of flight and schedule changes from Nov 
to Mar 2018. We have less than 400,000 customers booked on these flights, (which affects less than 1 
flight per day across our 200 airports over the 5 month winter period), and many of these flights have 
zero bookings at this time. Less than 1% of the 50m customers Ryanair will carry this winter are affected 
and every one of these customers has received an email today giving them between        5 weeks to 5 
months notice of these schedule changes, offering them alternative flights or full refunds of their 
airfare. They have also received a EUR40 (EUR80 return) travel voucher which will allow them to book - 
during October - a flight on any Ryanair service between October and March 2018.
 (b)  We have also emailed each of the 315,000 customers whose flights were previously cancelled over a 6 
week period in Sept and Oct. (Ryanair carries 15m customers every 6 weeks) We have offered each of these 
customers a EUR40 travel voucher (EUR80 return), again for travel between October and March 2018. This 
flight voucher is in addition to the flight re-accommodation/refunds they received last week, and 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR END ROSTER CANCELLATIONS BY SLOWING GROWTH
applicable to the EU261 compensation which they may claim and receive over the coming weeks. (Note: EUR40 
per seat exceeds Ryanair current ave. fare).
 (c)  For the other 99% of Ryanair customers who are unaffected by these flight cancellations and schedule 
changes, this slower rate of growth means that from today there is no risk of further roster related 
flight cancellations. These measures have already restored Ryanair's industry leading reliability and 
punctuality. Customers will also enjoy lower airfares, as Ryanair responds to last week's rostering 
failure, by rolling out seat sales over the coming days and weeks. This starts this weekend with a 1 
million, EUR9.99 one way, seat sale for travel in Oct, Nov and Dec.
 2.   For Ryanair's Pilots
 (A) We appreciate the widespread support we have received from our 4,200 pilots over the past weeks. 
Hundreds of pilots, and many of their ERC's have been in regular contact with the airline offering to work 
days off, to work one week of their allocated month of leave, and offering to go public to correct the 
false claims made about them, and Ryanair, by competitor airline pilots in certain media outlets. We 
appreciate their professionalism which has meant that since last Monday (18(th) Sept.) Ryanair has 
operated over 16,000 daily flights with only 3 cancellations, and over 96% of all first wave flights 
departing on time.
 (B) This slower growth will provide stability to pilot rosters from November to March. We will not need 
pilots to give up one week of their well-earned annual leave from Nov. onwards. Slower growth creates a 
large surplus of standby pilots so we can allocate all annual leave due in the 3 months to December, and 
more again in Q1 of 2018.
 (C) We have communicated these changes by email to Ryanair pilots today. We have assured them that all 
their annual leave is protected. This now eliminates the roster problems this winter, because slower 
growth means we no longer require our pilots to reorganise their annual leave.
 We are implementing a EUR10,000Capts/EUR5,000F.O. base supplements at Dublin, Stansted, Berlin and 
Frankfurt from 1(st) October as we agreed these pay increases with the 4 base ERC's at recent meetings. We 
received requests from a number of other ERC's who wish to discuss these issues, and we have agreed to 
schedule meetings with these ERC's over the coming months.
 (D) We will not respond or accede to anonymous demands made via unsigned emails for group or regional 
meetings, or for union interference at these internal ERC meetings. Many of our pilots and ERC's have 
confirmed that these unsigned letters were drafted by pilots/unions of competitor airlines who wish to 
pursue an industrial relations agenda at the expense of Ryanair and its pilots.
 (E) We have also written to our pilots to correct last week's false claims made about our pilot 
recruitment. In the current year under 100 Captains have left (mainly to retirement or long haul airlines) 
and less than 160 F.O's (mostly to long haul airlines). Over the next 8 months Ryanair has recruited and 
will train over 650 pilots not only to replace these leavers/retirees but also to crew up for the 50 new 
Boeing aircraft we will buy to May 2018 to bring our fleet to 445 for S18. Contrary to false claims of 
pilot shortages, Ryanair has in recent weeks seen a big surge in pilot applications from Gulf carriers and 
in Germany and Italy where both Air Berlin and Alitalia are in bankruptcy and hundreds of their pilots are 
facing job losses or steep cuts in their pay and conditions.
 3.   For our Shareholders
 (A) This slower rate of growth will slightly reduce our traffic this year and next. Our monthly growth 
from Nov 17 to March 18 will slow from 9% to 4%. Our full year traffic of 131m will now moderate to 129m, 
which is 7.5% up on last year. By slowing our summer 2018 fleet growth from 445 to 435 aircraft, we expect 
traffic to March 2019 will slow from 142m to 138m, a 7% rate of growth.
 (B) The total cost of the flight cancellations last week should be under EUR25m. We expect the cost of 
the free flight vouchers issued today to affected customers will be less than EUR25m. We expect slightly 
lower yields over the next two months as we promote seat sales. We do not expect these initiatives to 
alter our current year guidance of between EUR1.40bn to EUR1.45bn PAT. We will provide a full update on 
these issues to shareholders during the half year results in late October.
 4.   For our People
 We have rearranged our pilot recruitment and rostering function and will invest in more rostering 
resources to ensure this failure cannot recur. The 13,000 highly skilled aviation professionals in Ryanair 
continue to deliver Europe's lowest air fares to a growing and loyal customer base of 129m passengers p.a. 
This, over 30 year record of exceptional delivery, will continue but only if we learn from this mistake 
and work hard to ensure it never happens again. In order to focus on repairing this rostering problem this 
winter, Ryanair will eliminate all management distractions starting with its interest in Alitalia. We have 
notified the Alitalia bankruptcy Commissioners that we will not be pursuing our interest in Alitalia or 
submitting any further offers for the airline.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said
 "We sincerely apologise to those customers who have been affected by last week's flight cancellations, or 
these sensible schedule changes announced today. While over 99% of our 129m customers will not have been 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR END ROSTER CANCELLATIONS BY SLOWING GROWTH
affected by any cancellations or disruptions, we deeply regret any doubt we caused existing customers last 
week about Ryanair's reliability, or the risk of further cancellations.
 From today, there will be no more rostering related flight cancellations this winter or in summer 2018. 
Slower growth this winter, will create lots of spare aircraft and crews which will allow us to manage the 
exceptional volumes of annual leave we committed to delivering in the 9 months to Dec 2017. We will start 
a new 12 month leave period on the 1(st) of Jan 2018 in full compliance with EU regulations and the IAA's 
requirements.
 All of the passengers who have been affected by these disruptions have now been offered re-accommodation 
or full refunds and their applicable EU261 entitlements. In addition today, they are receiving a travel 
voucher (EUR40 one way/EUR80 return) which they may use to book any Ryanair flight of their choice during 
October for travel between October and March 2018. We look forward to welcoming them all on board."

 RYANAIR SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE ALL RESOLUTIONS AT ITS AGM
 Ryanair Holdings PLC today (21 Sept) held its 2017 AGM at its Dublin Offices during which shareholders approved 
all resolutions by substantial majorities. The shareholder votes in favour of the Financial Report (99.2% in favour) 
and the Remuneration Report (88.7%) were passed with increased majorities compared to 2016.
 Ryanair Chairman, David Bonderman, paid tribute to James Osborne, who tragically passed away in August 
having served as a Director of Ryanair for over 20 years, and expressed his condolences to Mr Osborne's family 
and friends.
 Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary apologised to shareholders, and again to customers, for the cancellation of 2,100 of 
its over 103,000 flights over a 6 week period in September and October, due to a failure within its pilot rostering 
function. Ryanair expects by the end of this week to have re-accommodated (or authorised refund requests to) over 
95% of the 315,000 customers affected by these cancellations.

 RYANAIR CANCELLATIONS - UPDATE
 Ryanair today (Wed 20(th) Sept) provided an update on its progress at working through the cancellation of 2,100 of 
its 103,000 flights over the next 6 weeks as follows:
 - All 315,000 customers received email notices on Mon 18(th) advising them of their flight changes and offering 
alternative flights, refunds and EU261 notices. (The figure is lower than the original 390,000 estimate because 
forward bookings in September were 90% but October were 70%)

other Ryanair flights - over 55% of affected customers.

 RYANAIR PUBLISHES LIST OF FLIGHTS TO BE CANCELLED UP TO END OF OCTOBER
 OVER 98% OF RYANAIR CUSTOMERS WILL BE UNAFFECTED
 Ryanair today (18 Sept) confirmed that it has published the full list of flight cancellations (now less than 50 per day) 
between Thurs 21(st) Sept. to Tues 31(st) Oct. next. These cancellations have been allocated where possible, to 
Ryanair's bigger base airports, and routes with multiple daily frequencies so that Ryanair can offer these disrupted 
customers the maximum number of alternate flights and routes in order to minimise inconvenience to them.
 The full list of these flight cancellations (from Thurs 21(st) to Thurs Oct 31(st) ) will appear on the Ryanair.com 
website later today, and customers affected by these cancellations will be emailed with offers of alternative flights or 
full refunds, and details of their EU261 compensation entitlement.
 The airports where one line of flying will be removed for the next 6 weeks are as follows, (these airports have been 
selected because of the high frequency of flights Ryanair operates to/from these airports where customers can be 
offered the most accommodating options):
Barcelona        1 of 12 lines of
 flights
 ---------------  -----------------
 Brussels Charl   1 of 13 lines of
 flights
 ---------------  -----------------
 Dublin           1 of 23 lines of
 flights
 ---------------  -----------------
 Lisbon           1 of 4 lines of

 ---------------  -----------------
 London Stan      2 of 41 lines of
 flights
 ---------------  -----------------
 Madrid           1 of 13 lines of

 ---------------  -----------------
 Milan Bergamo    1 of 14 lines of
 flights
 ---------------  -----------------
 Porto            1 of 8 lines of
 flights
 ---------------  -----------------
 Rome Fiumi       1 of 3 lines of
 flights
 ---------------  -----------------
While Ryanair sincerely regrets and apologises for these cancellations, it pointed out that they will affect less than 
2% of all customers over the next 6 weeks, and the majority of these passengers will be offered alternative flights 
on the same or next day. For those passengers who cannot, or do not wish to take the alternative flights offered 
they will receive a full refund and their EU261 compensation.
 Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said;
 "While over 98% of our customers will not be affected by these cancellations over the next 6 weeks, we apologise 
unreservedly to those customers whose travel will be disrupted, and assure them that we have done our utmost to 
try to ensure that we can re-accommodate most of them on alternative flights on the same or next day.
 Ryanair is not short of pilots - we were able to fully crew our peak summer schedule in June, July and August - but 
we have messed up the allocation of annual leave to pilots in Sept and Oct because we are trying to allocate a full 
year's leave into a 9 month period from April to December. This issue will not recur in 2018 as Ryanair goes back 
onto a 12 month calendar leave year from 1(st) Jan to 31(st) December 2018.
 This is a mess of our own making. I apologise sincerely to all our customers for any worry or concern this has 
caused them over the past weekend. We have only taken this decision to cancel this small proportion of our 2,500 
daily flights so that we can provide extra standby cover and protect the punctuality of the 98% of flights that will be 
unaffected by these cancellations."

 RYANAIR TO CANCEL LESS THAN 2% OF FLIGHTS OVER NEXT 6 WEEKS TO IMPROVE PUNCTUALITY
 Ryanair, today (15(th) Sept) announced that it would cancel 40-50 flights daily for the next six weeks 
(to the end of October) to improve its system-wide punctuality which has fallen below 80% in the first two 
weeks of September through a combination of ATC capacity delays and strikes, weather disruptions and the 
impact of increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew as the airline moves to allocate annual 
leave during a 9 month transition period (April to December 2017) to move the airline's holiday year 
(currently April to March) to a calendar year (Jan to Dec) from 1(st) January 2018 onwards.
 Ryanair has operated at record schedule and traffic levels during the peak summer months of July (12.6m 
guests) and August (12.7m guests) but has a backlog of crew leave which must be allocated before 31(st) 
Dec 2017 in order to switch to a calendar leave year (as required by the IAA) from 1(st) Jan 2018 onwards.
 These tighter crewing numbers and the impact of ATC capacity restrictions in the UK, Germany and Spain, 
as well as French ATC strikes and adverse weather (thunderstorms) have given rise to significant delays in 
recent weeks.   Ryanair's on-time performance has declined from 90% to under 80% over the past two weeks, 
a figure that is unacceptable to Ryanair and its customers.
 By reducing its scheduled flying programme over the next six weeks by less than 2% (of its over 2,500 
daily flights), the airline will create additional standby aircraft which will help restore on-time 
performance to its 90% average.  Ryanair apologises sincerely for the inconvenience caused to customers by 
these cancellations. Customers will be contacted directly about this small number of cancellations and 
offered alternative flights or full refunds.
 Ryanair's Robin Kiely said:
 "We have operated a record schedule (and traffic numbers) during the peak summer months of July and 
August but must now allocate annual leave to pilots and cabin crew in September and October (while still 
running the bulk of our summer schedule).  This increased leave at a time of ATC capacity delays and 
strikes, has severely reduced our on-time performance over the past two weeks to under 80%.  By cancelling 
less than 2% of our flying programme over the next six weeks, (until our winter schedule starts in early 
November) we can improve the operational resilience of our schedules and restore punctuality to our 
annualised target of 90%.
 We apologise sincerely to the small number of customers affected by these cancellations, and will be 
doing our utmost to arrange alternative flights and/or full refunds for them."

 RYANAIR WELCOMES ECJ "MONS" RULING UPHOLDING EU LAW &
 RYANAIR'S POSITION ON MEMBER STATE JURISDICTION FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSPORT WORKERS
 Ryanair today (14 Sept) welcomed the decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the "Mons" case which 
found in favour of Ryanair by rejecting the CTC Union argument that the home base (i.e where crew start and end 
their work day) should be the sole determinant of what court jurisdiction can hear disputes on labour issues.
 The ECJ has ruled that all current factors such as where the worker gets their instructions, where 
goods/passengers are loaded/unloaded, where the work tools are stored, where the work is organised/performed 
and where the worker returns to at the end of their duty should continue to be considered in conjunction with the 
home base as part of an overall assessment in determining jurisdiction.
 This ECJ decision does not change the status quo of Irish Contracts of Employment for Ryanair crew based across 
Europe. Ryanair will continue to employ its crew on Irish contracts of employment, and this decision only updates 
the criteria for assessing the jurisdiction of national courts to hear legal cases locally and does not alter the law 
applicable to the contract, which is determined by the Rome I regulation (593/2008).
 All EU Member States' national employment legislation is derived from EU directives to ensure protection for 
employees in relation to areas including annual leave, maternity leave and sickness benefits. Irish legislation has 
adopted all EU directives on employment rights which are also covered in Ryanair contracts of employment and in 
some cases, offers better protection than some EU countries; for example, maternity leave in Ireland is more 
favourable than in Belgium and the Irish minimum wage is also amongst the highest in Europe.
 Ryanair's Chief People Officer Eddie Wilson said:
 "We welcome this "Mons" case ruling which upholds the existing EU rules on the jurisdiction of Member States 
national courts, and accepts Ryanair's position that just one criteria (i.e. basing) cannot unilaterally determine 
jurisdiction. Maintaining broad assessment criteria ensures that the most appropriate jurisdiction should apply in 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR WELCOMES ECJ " MONS " COURT RULING
cases involving international transport workers rather than a sole criterion approach, which would narrow the 
assessment and restrict movement and flexibility with a myriad of regulations and different crews throughout 
Europe.
 We do not believe this "Mons" ruling will in any way alter our Irish contracts of employment or the union rights 
which all of our people enjoy under the protection of the Irish Constitution."

 RYANAIR TO LOWER CHECKED BAG FEES (& RAISE SIZE ALLOWANCE) TO ELIMINATE BOARDING DELAYS
 NON-PRIORITY CUSTOMERS MUST PUT 2(ND) (BIGGER) BAG IN HOLD (FREE OF CHARGE) FROM NOVEMBER
 Ryanair, Europe's No 1 airline, today (6 Sep), as part of its "Always Getting Better" programme announced 
new reduced checked bag fees (and increased check-in bag sizes) to encourage more customers to check in 
bags and reduce the number of customers with 2 bags at the boarding gates. As too many customers are 
availing of Ryanair's improved 2 free carry-on bags service, and with high load factors (97% in August) 
there is not enough overhead cabin space for this volume of carry-on bags, which is causing 
boarding/flight delays.
 To encourage more customers to check-in some bags and reduce the volume of carry-on bags, Ryanair will 
introduce the following bag policy changes on all flights from 1(st) November next:
 --    The check-in bag allowance will increase from 15kg to 20kg for all bags
 --    The standard check-in bag fee will be cut from EUR/GBP35 to EUR/GBP25 for this 20kg bag
 --    Only Priority Boarding customers (including Plus, Flexi Plus & Family Plus) will be allowed to 
bring two carry-on bags on the aircraft*
 --    All other (i.e. non-priority) customers will only be allowed to bring one smaller carry-on bag on 
board the aircraft, while their second (bigger) wheelie bag must be placed in the hold (free of charge) at 
the boarding gate.
 Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:
 "These bag policy changes will cost Ryanair over EUR50m p.a. in reduced checked bag fees. However, we 
believe offering bigger bags at reduced fees will encourage more customers to consider checking-in a bag, 
which will reduce the high volume of customers we have with 2 carry-on bags at the boarding gates, which 
is causing flight delays due to large numbers of gate bag and cabin bag offloads.
 We hope that by restricting non-priority customers to one small carry-on bag - their wheelie bag must be 
placed in the hold, free of charge at the boarding gate - this will speed up the boarding of flights and 
eliminate flight delays being caused by not having sufficient overhead cabin space on busy flights to 
accommodate over 360 (182 customers x 2 bags) carry-on bags.
 These lower bag fees and increased bag size allowances will come into play for all bookings for travel 
after 1(st) November, and we hope our customers will enjoy the savings of our new simplified bag policy."
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LOWERS CHECKED BAG FEES & RAISES ALLOWANCE
 * Priority Boarding can be purchased for just EUR/GBP5 at the time of booking or added to a booking for 
EUR/GBP6 and is available up to one hour prior to scheduled departure.

 RYANAIR LAUNCHES RECORD LONDON S18 SCHEDULE
 6 NEW SUMMER ROUTES TO AALBORG, BYDGOSZCZ, DUSSELDORF, FRANKFURT, ORADEA & PARDUBICE, DELIVERS 24.8M 
CUSTOMERS
 Ryanair, Europe's No.1 airline, today (31 Aug) launched its London summer 2018 schedule, with 168 routes 
in total, including 5 new London Stansted routes to Aalborg, Dusseldorf (Weeze), Frankfurt, Oradea and 
Pardubice, and a new London Luton route to Bydgoszcz, which will help deliver 24.8m customers p.a. through 
Ryanair's 3 London airports this year.
 Ryanair's London S18 schedule will deliver:
 At Stansted:
 --     5 new summer routes: Aalborg (4 wkly), Dusseldorf Weeze (4 wkly), Frankfurt (2 daily),
 Oradea (3 wkly) & Pardubice (3 wkly)
 --     144 routes in total
 --     21.4m customers p.a.
 --     16,000* on-site jobs
 At Gatwick:
 --     5 routes: Alicante (daily), Belfast (4 daily), Cork (daily), Dublin (7 daily) & Shannon (daily)
 --     1.8m customers p.a.
 --     1,300* on-site jobs
 At Luton:
 --     1 new summer route to Bydgoszcz (4 wkly)
 --     19 routes in total

 UK consumers and visitors can book their holidays as far out as October 2018, on even lower fares, and 
enjoy the latest "Always Getting Better" improvements including:
 --     20 Air Europa long haul routes from Madrid on sale on Ryanair.com
 --     Connecting flights at Rome Fiumicino and Milan Bergamo with more airports to follow
 --     A new partnership with Erasmus Student Network offering discounts & a dedicated booking platform
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LAUNCHES RECORD LONDON S18 SCHEDULE
 --     Alexa voice recognition to search flights, hotels and flight status on the Ryanair.com website
 Ryanair will continue to connect London with major business centres on high frequency, low fare services 
including Berlin (4 daily), Dublin (18 daily), Edinburgh (4 daily), Madrid (4 daily) and Rome (5 daily), 
with better timings and lower fares, making Ryanair the ideal choice for London business and leisure 
customers and visitors.
 However, given the uncertainty surrounding Brexit in March 2019, Ryanair reiterated the need for clarity 
before it publishes its summer 2019 schedule in the second quarter of 2018. Ryanair warned it may be 
forced to cancel flights and move some, or all, of its UK based aircraft to Continental Europe from April 
2019 onwards should the legal basis for the operation of flights between the UK and the EU by autumn 2018 
remain undefined.
 In London, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "We are pleased to launch our London summer 2018 schedule, which includes 5 new Stansted routes to 
Aalborg, Dusseldorf Weeze, Frankfurt, Oradea and Pardubice, a new Luton route to Bydgoszcz, and 168 routes 
in total, which will deliver 24.8m customers through London's airports this year. UK customers and 
visitors are booking our summer and winter 2017 seats in record numbers as fares continue to fall, so 
there's never been a better time to book a low fare flight on Ryanair.
 We remain concerned at the uncertainty which surrounds the terms of the UK's departure from the EU in 
March '19. While we continue to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU Open Skies agreement, we caution 
that should the UK leave, there may not be sufficient time, or goodwill on both sides, to negotiate a 
timely replacement bilateral which could result in a disruption of flights between the UK and Europe for a 
period of time from April '19 onwards, and/or the cancellation of flights and routes, and the movement of 
our based aircraft to Continental Europe.
 To celebrate the launch of our London summer 2018 schedule we are releasing seats for sale from just 
GBP14.99 for travel in September which are available for booking until midnight Monday (4 Sep). Since 
these amazing low prices will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com and avoid 
missing out."

 RYANAIR CALLS ON BUNDESKARTELLAMT & EU COMMISSION TO
 BLOCK LUFTHANSA-AIR BERLIN TAKE-OVER & PREVENT
 LUFTHANSA MONOPOLY RAISING FARES FOR GERMAN CONSUMERS
 Ryanair, Europe's No. 1 airline, today (30 Aug) urged the German Bundeskartellamt and the EU Commission to 
block the stitch-up between the German Government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin to carve up Air Berlin's assets, while 
excluding major competitors and ignoring both competition and State Aid rules, and called for immediate action to 
block this anti-consumer take-over.
 This insolvency is being timed to allow Lufthansa to take over a debt-free Air Berlin (its major German competitor) 
which will be in breach of all German and EU competition rules, and this Lufthansa monopoly has been supported 
by the German Government providing EUR150m of State Aid, so that Lufthansa can acquire Air Berlin, as 
Lufthansa moves from a 68% share to a 95% monopoly, which will result in German customers and visitors 
suffering higher air fares. Competitor airlines will struggle to get slots in major airports such as Berlin, Hamburg, 
Frankfurt and Munich, where Lufthansa will control over 80% of peak time slots.
 Ryanair also urged all Berliners to vote "Yes" on 24(th) Sept to keep Tegel Airport open. The new Brandenburg 
Airport will have a capacity of only 27m passengers, which is less than Dublin (a city with one-third of Berlin's 
population). With almost 33m passengers already travelling through Berlin's 2 existing Schonefeld and Tegel 
airports last year, the planned closure of Tegel will leave Berlin with less airport capacity than its existing traffic.
 In Berlin, Ryanair's Michael O'Leary said:
 "The German Bundeskartellamt and the European Commission must block the anti-consumer stitch-up playing out 
between the German Government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin.  Given that the German Government is centrally 
involved in these manoeuvres (loaning EUR150m), the Bundeskartellamt will be afraid to impose competition rules. 
Ryanair Holdings PLC Ryanair Calls to Block Lufthansa -Air Berlin Deal
On this basis, it is vital that the European Commission takes immediate and decisive action to protect German 
consumers from a Lufthansa high fare monopoly.
 Ryanair will continue to grow in Germany as more and more German customers choose our low fares and "Always 
Getting Better" customer service over Lufthansa's high fare monopoly"

 Ryanair, Ireland's No. 1 airline, today (29 Aug) launched its Dublin summer 2018 schedule with 5 new 
routes including a double daily service to Munich, a daily Stuttgart service, as well as Marrakech, Naples 
and Paphos, and more flights to Hamburg.  Ryanair's 90 routes in total will help deliver 12.9m customers 
p.a. through Dublin Airport next year.
 Ryanair's Dublin S18 schedule will deliver:
 --     5 new routes: Marrakech (2 wkly), Munich (2 daily), Naples (5 wkly), Paphos (2 wkly) & Stuttgart 
(daily)
 --     Extra flights to Hamburg (daily)
 --     90 routes in total
 --     12.9m customers p.a. (+450,000)
 --     9,675* on-site jobs
 Irish consumers and visitors can now book their holidays as far out as October 2018, on even lower fares, 
and enjoy the  latest "Always Getting Better" improvements including:
 --     20 Air Europa long haul routes from Madrid on sale on Ryanair.com

 --     A new partnership with Erasmus Student Network offering discounts & a dedicated booking platform
 --     Alexa voice recognition to search flights, hotels and flight status on the Ryanair.com website
 Ryanair continues to be Ireland's number one airline carrying 14.9m customers through Irish Airports next 
year while connecting Dublin with major leisure and business centres on high frequency, low fare services 
including Amsterdam (x4 daily), Berlin (x2), Brussels (x3), Hamburg (daily), London (x18), Madrid (x3) and 
Munich (x2) with better timings and lower fares, making Ryanair the ideal choice for Irish business and

 In Dublin, Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs said:

total, delivering 12.9m customers through Dublin Airport next year. Irish customers and visitors are 
Ryanair Holdings PLC RYANAIR LAUNCHES DUBLIN S18 SCHEDULE
booking our summer and winter 2017 seats in record numbers as fares continue to fall, so there's never 
been a better time to book a low fare flight on Ryanair.
 The development of the second runway at Dublin Airport is a critical piece of national infrastructure 
which needs to be expedited, especially when Ireland is trying to attract overseas investment that may be 
leaving the UK in the run up to Brexit in March 2019, and given that runway capacity at Dublin is already 
full at peak times. We call on the Government, the Department of Transport, and the Attorney General's 
office to end the repeated delays and confirm that the necessary noise legislation will be implemented by 
statutory instrument, making the IAA the competent authority to monitor noise regulation, to allow 
Dublin's second runway to proceed, at a cost of EUR240m. We need urgent action to deliver runway 2 to 
prevent Ireland's airport infrastructure falling further behind its international competitors.
 To celebrate the launch of our Dublin summer 2018 schedule we are releasing seats for sale from just 
EUR14.99 for travel in September and October which are available for booking until midnight Thursday (31 
Aug). Since these amazing low prices will be snapped up quickly, customers should log onto www.ryanair.com

 "We are delighted to see Ryanair add five new routes from Dublin Airport, two for this winter and three 
for the forthcoming summer season. These new routes will offer additional choice and convenience for both 
business and leisure passengers. The combination of Ryanair's new routes and extensions to its existing 
services means that Ryanair will grow its overall Dublin Airport summer traffic by 4%  next year."
